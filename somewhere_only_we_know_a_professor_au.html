<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Lips pressed against the side of her neck. They were soft like velvet, cool to the touch as they moved from the corner of her jaw and down. Agatha smiled as the lips continued their journey, the lips lingering a little longer with each subtle press. She kept her eyes closed, not wanting to face the world as she melted back against the cool body behind her, a hand now on her waist and moving to rest upon her stomach. The lips moved up to her check, peppering kisses there, and she couldn’t help but let out a soft chuckle as the lips then moved, placing a longing one on the corner of her mouth. Unfortunately, to her great displeasure, they moved away following the hand on her stomach and body that wrapped her in eternal protection. </p><p>Then, her hair was tucked behind her ear, another kiss placed on her lips. She smiled into it, turning to grant her better access as she caressed a sharp jaw. Once more, the woman pulled away and the bed shifted with the lack of weight. She peaked open an eye, smirking as she caught sight of her wife’s figure– strong defiant curves, muscles rippling down her shoulders and arms, and the perfect roundness of her ass fading into their walk-in closet. Agatha waited, her eyes still heavy from sleep, but they immediately perked up at the sight of her wife dressed in black jeans and a green blouse before disappearing out their door. </p><p>Before she could follow, she groaned, her stomach lurching. She made it just in time, the rush of acid spilling into the sink. She pulled back, trying to move her hair away as her stomach flipped again and the stinging rush came back. Then, within seconds, hands gathered her hair, pulling back as another rubbed soothing circles. Agatha leaned against the sink as the grounding presence behind her remained. She didn’t get the chance to speak as another round of nausea hit her, spilling out whatever she ate last night. She groaned as a washcloth was there, wiping her mouth and a glass of water already beside her. </p><p>“Are you sure you can go in today, <em> mi amor </em>?” the words were soft, but carried the weight of concern and love the woman had for her. </p><p>She swallowed down the water, lifting her head to meet soft brown eyes in the mirror, nodding, “My classes are late today. It should be fine.”</p><p>Her wife only held her lips in a tight line as she crossed her arms, “It’s just, it’s still early for anyone to know. I don’t want you overworking yourself or stressed, my love.” </p><p>Agatha turned, caressing her cheek, “I promise, my love. I am fine.” </p><p>Rio simply raised an eyebrow, her head turning to the side. Agatha knew that look, one that said she didn’t believe her. She held the gaze, defiance in her eyes until the eyebrow lowered and softness swept her wife’s features. She took in her perfect almond eyes, the button of her nose, and the way her black hair sat in tangles around down her shoulders. She couldn’t help it as her gaze then turned to those perfect lips, the cupid’s bow leading to carefully crafted ridges of the columns up towards her nose. </p><p>Those lips moved, placing a gentle kiss on her forehead, “I will make you ginger tea and some breakfast. Get ready, <em> mi amor. </em>” </p><hr/><p>The morning was like any other, except for breakfast. They usually never ate breakfast, rather spending their mornings with slow kisses and one of them urging them both to get out of bed before they were late. But Rio had grown more protective, pampering her as they waited for the safe time to announce that Agatha was indeed pregnant. She found Rio more attentive, making sure she was eating throughout the day and also hiding the caffeine. She forced her to take the previous Thursday and Friday off as Agatha spent the most recent days in bed as dizzy spells and morning sickness hit her left and right. Rio only took Friday off, not even at work an hour when she burst back through the door, finding Agatha on the floor by the toilet. Agatha hadn’t even texted or called, but somehow Rio knew and was there, holding her for the rest of day.</p><p>Today was her first day back, truly understanding that they had created life together, their child growing inside her. The only upcoming obstacle was that no one knew they were married, except Doctor Alice Wu-Guiliver, a music professor and Rio’s best friend, and Doctor Lilia Calderu, the other music professor. The four of them were secretly all friends, and the reason for the secrecy was because of Rio’s positions: the faculty Dean and the Head of the Biological Science Department. Rio was one of the most successful of her peers, holding a position of power and balance, and proof of the natural order of Westview University of New Jersey. She was one of the youngest in her peer group, but unwavering, talented in her lectures, and somehow a rule follower when it came to her dean position. But if you were to ask her students, she was crazy during lab. Completely two different personalities coming out, an enigma, and a lone wolf. Dr. Harkness was the witch of the Literature department, reigning over her class with power and control. She was calculated, her lectures long, but promising for the listening ear. Agatha Harkness was the professor students hated and loved at the same time. And as far as the faculty and students were concerned, Rio and Agatha didn’t really know one another, and they both wanted to keep it that way, afraid it would undermine Rio’s authority.</p><p>Agatha didn’t mind, in fact the secrecy was fun. It was <em> their </em> love, <em> their </em>life, and all the flirting, touches, and kisses behind closed doors made their love all the more precious. Her favorite was when they would cross paths, both of them slipping into a mask of professionalism, acting if they hadn’t woken up in the same bed, driven in the same car, and weren’t returning together to their home just outside of campus after the day was done. Rio was cold, collective, and quiet, her own reputation casting fear and respect among her colleagues. Agatha was just as cold, but she was mean, coldhearted, and didn’t tolerate bullshit. To outsiders it would seem their personalities would clash, both cold and competitive professors, but no one knew the tenderness and love they held behind closed doors. </p><hr/><p>“Agatha, come on, we are going to be late!” Rio yelled across the house, tapping her foot impatiently. </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, fixing her hair before coming out into their living room where Rio stood by the door, already in her black coat, her hair held in a claw clip, and her bag slung across her shoulder. Rio smiled at her, her eyes unashamedly moving up and down her wife’s body. She was in her signature purple pants, white blouse, and Rio’s– and Agatha’s – favorite blue coat. Rio reached out, tucking a strand of hair that fell from her carefully crafted messy bun behind her ears. She leaned in, placing a longing kiss on her lips. Agatha melted into it and cupped her cheek as Rio turned them, her hands on her wife’s waist before gently pushing her against a wall. Agatha chuckled, getting her wife to pull away. </p><p>“Now, who’s going to make us late?” she teased as Rio pouted, leaning to place another kiss on her lips. </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and brought her hand up on Rio’s chest, “Come on, like you won’t see me at lunch.” </p><p>Rio grumbled, grabbing their keys as Agatha grabbed her own bag, “But I won’t be able to kiss you.” </p><p>Agatha patted her cheek, “We have all of tonight, but don’t tell me I didn’t tire you out after last night.”</p><p>With that she stepped through the door, meeting the chill of the crisp autumn air. The wind blew gently, leaves dancing in their colors of yellow, red, and orange. Some of the trees clung to their coat of green, mixing already with colors as the sun sat on the horizon. Behind her, she heard her wife muttering in Spanish, and the jingle of keys. She chuckled as Rio passed her, opening the passenger door for her. </p><p><em> Always the charmer, </em>she thought fondly as she took her seat. </p><p>The drive was quiet, minus Rio’s need for music in the morning. She watched as they passed the looming houses of their plan before the campus slowly crept up. Mansions turned into dingy little houses, some nicer while others held empty beer bottles, strings of toilet paper, and the occasional student walking towards the quad. Agatha kept her hand in Rio’s as her wife drove with ease, turning into the faculty parking, but when Rio turned again Agatha sat up. </p><p>“My love, where are you going? Our parking spot was back there.” </p><p>Rio only smirked, her gaze not leaving the road as they came closer to the literature and language building: Poets’ Haven. Its red brick loomed over them as Rio parked in the back, away from prying eyes, but not far enough away that their vehicle was suspicious. </p><p>Her wife smirked at her as the engine switched off,  “Don’t want you exerting yourself, <em> mi amor. </em>” </p><p>Agatha groaned, placing her head in her hands, “Rio, I am pregnant not–”</p><p>“Exactly,” Rio cut her off, her hand across the center dial and resting on her stomach. “Now, remember, no caffeine, please try not to yell, and text me the second you throw up and we are going home.”</p><p>“Rio, you can’t just run us home, every time I feel a little bit sick–” </p><p>Rio arched an eyebrow, her lips pressed into a firm line as she leaned back in her seat, “Try me. I am your boss, afterall.” </p><p>Agtha let out an exasperated sigh, lifting her head from her hands to meet her wife’s unwavering gaze, “ You’re impossible.” </p><p>“And you’re stubborn,” Rio countered, her tone softening as her fingers gently brushed against her wife’s stomach. “But I’m not taking any chances with you or <em> them. </em>” </p><p>A warmth spread Agatha’s chest, melting her frustration, but she knew better than to allow that to truly show. If she did, her wife would fully win, “I’m perfectly capable of taking care of myself, you know.” </p><p>Rio smiled faintly, her dark brown eyes glowing gold in the light of the oncoming sun as they met Agatha’s, “I know, but let me take care of you anyway.” </p><p>Agatha couldn’t stop the blush in her cheeks as her eyes fluttered close, feeling the pounding of her heart. Rio and her had been together for over fifteen years and married for ten, but no matter how many times Rio constantly proved her love to her, constantly showered her in gifts and affection, she would never get used to it. She couldn’t wrap her head around how someone could love her so effortlessly, like it was as simple as breathing air, and here was Rio, proving her time and time again that her love could defy the cosmos. </p><p>She shook out the blush, eyeing her wife, “Fine, but I am getting decaf from the professor’s lounge.” </p><p>Rio’s gaze hardened, “No, herbal tea.”</p><p>Agatha hardened her own gaze, holding her eyes as the car cracked with tension. It was a silent battle of wits as their faces leaned in closer and closer. Agatha wouldn’t lose, she never did when they did this. Then, those chocolate eyes grew closer, lips planting on hers and forcing her to blink. </p><p>“I win. Herbal tea, Agatha.” </p><p>“You cheated.” </p><p>Rio smirked, her gaze menacing as her lips still lingered close enough to steal another kiss. </p><p>Her breath was hot and sweet against her as her voice dipped lower and teasingly, “All’s fair in love and keeping my wife healthy.” </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, though the slight curl in the corner of her lips betrayed her amusement, “You can’t just kiss me to win an argument, Rio.” </p><p>“It seems to work pretty well. Besides, you’re the one who said I am impossible to resist,” Rio shrugged, leaning back in her seat as her self-satisfied smirk grew.  </p><p>Agatha scoffed, “I don’t remember saying that.” </p><p>Rio tapped her chin thoughtfully, the golden specks in her eyes glinting with her <strike>adoring</strike> infuriating mischief, “Must of been implied then.” </p><p>Agatha turned, hiding her smile as she opened the car door and stepped into the chill of the fall day. </p><p>“Infuriating,” she muttered, grabbing her bag. </p><p>Rio quickly followed, locking the car and catching up to her wife as they walked towards the building. The rustling of leaves underfoot matched the rhythm of their steps, a comfortable harmony that seemed to echo the unspoken understanding between them. </p><p>As they approached the side entrance, Agatha stopped suddenly, whipping around towards her wife, “If I am to drink herbal tea, then I am drinking the lemon, none of that ginger shit from this morning.” </p><p>“You drive a hard bargain, Dr. Harkness.” </p><p>“Always, Dr.Vidal,” her face softened as Rio brushed past her. </p><p>Her words dripped into a whisper, “See you at lunch, <em> mi amor. </em>” </p><hr/><p>Her morning was quiet, organizing her notes for the upcoming lectures after lunch and setting her graded papers in the corner. She had made herself tea at her wife’s request, not that she would tell her, she did make it ginger as the nausea found her again. To her luck, she didn’t throw up, but it still made her uneasy. She placed a hand on her stomach, rubbing it slightly in circles wondering what was to come. She had one more week for her anxieties to let go. She was six weeks along, the morning sickness deciding to make its presence known last week and for Agatha to acknowledge she was very, very late. Next week, Rio and her took the day off to go to her first ultrasound appointment. Her body practically vibrated in excitement any time she thought of it– Rio holding her hand, the wand moving across her stomach, and the little life that would be on the screen along with their heart beat. They hadn’t planned for it to work, in fact Rio had tried to convince her it was fine for her to carry their first child, but Agatha wanted this more than she would ever admit out loud. Her wife knew her well, not picking the fight when she insisted that she would carry first. </p><p> </p><p>A knock on her door snapped her attention to the door. She sat up, moving over towards the computers to click on random documents so no one saw her home screen of her and Rio. Her wife didn’t even know that her back screen was the selfie Rio had taken when they went to the pumpkin patch two weeks ago. She smiled at it for a moment, staring at how pink her cheeks were, and it was more than from the cold. It was simply the fact her wife was placing a gentle kiss on her cheek, smiling into it as the pumpkins surrounded them. She pulled up the doc, before putting her hands on the desk. </p><p>“Come in,” she called, hardening her voice before the door opened. </p><p>She lost her cold demeanor upon her younger colleague entering, her red hair tied back and her eyes brightening upon seeing her. Dr. Wanda Maximoff, one of their recently hired professors and one Rio wasn’t so sure about. She carried two mugs, seeing the hot coffee down on her desk as she sat in a chair in front of her. </p><p>“Good morning, Agatha,” she smiled brightly. “I thought I would bring some coffee. It’s the new pumpkin spice from that café in town.” </p><p>Agatha stiffened for a moment, glancing at the clock that read twelve-twenty. Rio would be here soon, and she would not be pleased to see coffee around her. She forced her smile, sitting up straighter. </p><p>“Thank you, hon,” she drawled. “But I am actually on a diet.” </p><p>Wanda raised her eyebrows, “On a diet? Agatha, you’re skinny as a rail, why would you need a diet?” </p><p>She kept her smile, finding it wasn’t reaching her eyes, “Not that type of diet, just trying something new.” </p><p>Wanda played with her fingers as she nodded, her gaze distant for a moment. Agatha watched, her eyes sharp before the woman gathered her strength, sitting up straighter in the chair, and her eyes shining a bit too eagerly. </p><p>“Also, I was curious, if you may want to grab lunch together. I found this great place off campus, so it can just be the two of us” Agatha winced, but kept her gaze stone “and my treat. I thought it would be nice to get to know each other better.” </p><p>“That’s kind of you to offer,” Agatha said slowly, choosing her words carefully, “but I already have plans.” </p><p>Wanda’s smile faltered, just for a second, before she masked it with a playful laugh, “Plans? You’re always so busy, Agatha. You should let someone else spoil you for a change.” </p><p>Agatha chuckled softly, leaning in her chair as she maintained her professional composure, but her thoughts wandered to the previous night, rough hands holding her thighs open and that flick of her hot ton–</p><p>She blinked out of the image, “I appreciate the invite, Wanda, but I am quite well taken care of. Besides, I’d hate to impose on your schedule.” </p><p>“Oh, it wouldn’t be an imposition at all,” Wanda pressed, her tone light but insistent. “I mean, we are colleagues. It’s good to connect outside of work, don’t you think?”</p><p>At that Agatha bit back the urge to snap, but before she could respond, a knock came at the door. Relief spread through her chest, but she kept her expression neutral as her gaze narrowed towards the door. </p><p>“Come in,” she called, not missing the scowl on Wanda’s lips. </p><p>The door opened to reveal Rio, her dark eyes immediately sweeping the room. Her gaze landed on Wanda before narrowing to the coffee placed on the desk untouched in front of them. Agatha watched as Rio’s eyes darkened with a touch of agitation and curiosity as she went back to the woman in front of her. </p><p>“Dean Vidal,” Wanda stood upright, greeting Rio brightly, missing the coldness that was omitted from her. “I was just suggesting to Agatha that we should grab lunch together, you're more than welcome to join us.” </p><p>Rio quickly shot Agatha a glare, as her grip on the bag in her hand tightened slightly, but otherwise, the coldness remained, “Dr. Vidal is fine, Dr. Maximoff, and actually Dr. Harkness and I have some business to attend to, unless you forgot, Dr. Harkness?”</p><p>Agatha held back the urge to roll her eyes, but kept the same level of professionalism, “No, of course not, Dr. Vidal. I was just going to explain to Dr. Maximoff.” </p><p>Rio only lifted her head slightly, the annoyance now clear as day on her face as they held each other’s gaze longer than necessary. Rio was the first to look away, her mask slipping on as she stepped closer, placing an Olive Garden bag on the desk before facing Wanda, her arms crossed.Wanda lost her smile for a moment, something else shining in her eyes as she took a step back. </p><p>“Have a nice day, Dr. Maximoff. I trust you are getting adjusted, and sticking to your own schedule.” </p><p>Agatha bit her lip, looking away as she stifled her laughter, “Yes, thank you, Dr. Vidal. See you later, Dr. Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha watched her wife watch the newer professor scramble out of her office, her posture rigid as her jaw was set. There was no softness in her tone, just pure coldness like her black beating heart. Then, Rio locked the door behind her with a subtle click before turning on her heel, swiping the coffee off her desk and dumping it in the trash.</p><p>Her voice dripped with venom, “What? First names, she brings you coffee, and now she wants to grab lunch?”</p><p>She sighed, standing up and meeting her wife in the middle of the room. She gazed to her office door, finding Rio forgot to close the blinds, her anger blinding her. Agatha stepped around her, closing them herself before turning back to her wife. Rio stood motionless, her arms crossed as her icy gaze followed Agatha’s movements. Her chest rose and fell in a rhythm that spoke of controlled rage. </p><p>“You don’t think it’s odd, Agatha? Her getting so comfortable?” Rio’s words were clipped, sharp like a blade meant to cut through any confusion. </p><p>Agatha took a step towards her wife, her hands on her shoulders as her voice became soft, reassuring, “My love, she’s new. She is just being friendly.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes darkened further as she scoffed, her voice lowering with each word as a possessive ego coated them, “Friendly? She brought you coffee that smelled like it came straight from an expensive café. She asked you to lunch and then acted if you and her were closer as she invited me. That’s more than just friendly, Agatha. She wants more. I can see it.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes this time. Rio never changed, even from when they were ahead in their own PhD program together. </p><p>“My love, you are overthinking it.” </p><p>Rio almost growled, “Overthinking it? Tell me the last time someone brought you coffee? Asked you to lunch?”</p><p>Agatha sighed, her hands rubbing up and down on Rio’s chest, “That was all you, my love. But Maximoff is harmless. She’s new–”</p><p>Rio’s hands came down on her waist, pulling her flush against her, “Harmless?” Her voice was darkening, growing harder with each word as her face grew closer to Agatha’s, her breath brushing against her skin, “She’s not harmless. She is looking for a way in.” A finger traced along Agatha’s jaw as Rio drew closer, her possessiveness wrapping tighter around Agatha. Agatha’s breath caught as a thumb pressed against her lower lip. “And I won’t let her. <em> You’re mine </em>.”</p><p>Agatha reached up, cradling her wife’s face with a tenderness to break the intensity of her possessiveness. It was a move that always worked in her favor, feeling her wife melt into it. Her hand moved to wrap around her wrists as they stared at each other. </p><p>“I’m yours, my love. I am not going anywhere, especially not now,” her voice was tender as she lost herself in those beautiful dark eyes. </p><p>She took her wife’s hand, placing it on her stomach, and folding her completely. Rio’s eyes fluttered shut, the tension melting from her shoulders. Agatha leaned forward, pressing a warm kiss to her forehead as her thumb brushed against Rio’s jaw in a few strokes. Rio opened her eyes, meeting her wife’s as they remained in the close intimate space before Rio drew her closer, her arms around her waist she planted kisses down Agatha’s neck. </p><p>“You know I trust you, <em> mi amor. </em>I just don’t like anyone thinking they can get close to you,” she murmured into her skin. </p><p>Agatha chuckled, “Oh, <em> I know </em>, my love. You’ve always been so possessive of me.” </p><p>Rio pulled back, chomping her teeth playfully at her, “You love it.”</p><p>She shrugged, her voice dripping with sarcasm, “Yes, I love when you send women practically scrambling to get away from you.” </p><p>Her wife tongued the inside of her cheek, “Don’t play coy with me, Dr. Harkness. It’s your favorite trait of mine.” </p><p>“Debatable,” Agatha deadpanned. </p><p>“Really?” </p><p>There was a dangerous glint in Rio’s eyes as she leaned closer, her breath hot on her neck. Then, her lips were on her, trailing up to just below her ear before sucking lightly, drawing a soft gasp from Agatha’s lips. She melted for a moment, grasping Rio’s shoulders before pushing her away. </p><p>“Rio, we are at work,” she hissed, but her wife kept that stupid smirk on her face. </p><p>“Huh, really? I thought we were on lunch break.” </p><p>“Yes, at work. Whose rules are it to keep what we are a secret?” Agatha reminded. </p><p>Rio groaned, but held her still, pressing lighter kisses to the side of her face, “Alright, alright, but you’re still mine.” </p><p>Agatha nodded, wrapped her arms back around her wife’s neck, “Yes, my love. All yours.” </p><p>Rio melted into her fully, holding her closer as her possessiveness gave way to something more intimate and measured. Her Rio was always protective, always a force of nature, and according to her, never jealous, but it didn’t matter. Because Agatha? Well, she wouldn’t want her wife any other way. </p><hr/><p>“Oh, <em> mi amor, </em>” Rio stood up from her chair after they finished their lunch.</p><p>Agatha snapped her head up, watching her throw her coat on as she set her bag on the desk.</p><p>“Yes, my love?” Agatha asked as Rio stepped around the desk and bent down to her level. </p><p>They kissed softly and it took everything in Agatha’s power not to pull her down into her lap as Rio’s hand lingered on her stomach. </p><p>Her wife pulled away slightly, her tone soaked with familiar mischief as her breath was hot on her ear, “You might want to wear your hair down in front of your ears. Or if you brought your foundation.” </p><p>With that, Rio placed another kiss on her wife’s cheek and whisked away towards her door, “See you next meeting, Dr. Harkness.” </p><p>Agatha stared after her wife who unlocked the door, and left without another word except her evil cackle echoing down the halls. </p><p>Agatha turned to the mirror on the wall beside her, spotting the dark bruise just below her ear.</p><p> </p><p>Her grip tightened on her chair.</p><p> </p><p>She was going to kill Rio the moment they got home. </p>

<p>Rio’s grip tightened around her mug of coffee as her gaze scanned over the lab. Freshmen. She was stuck teaching freshmen this semester. She knew she shouldn’t be like this, but freshmen were too close to high schoolers, dramatic, energetic, eager, and far too nosy. She didn’t know where some of them got the idea that professors and students could be friends– well where they got the idea they could be friends with her. Agatha may be the witch of the literature department, but Rio? She was the green witch, the natural order of the Biological Sciences Department. She remembered back to their first day of class. A student literally asked her to do ice breakers. She had rolled her eyes, and replied that she didn’t care enough. She continued their lecture, but somehow that didn’t deter them from asking questions about her personal life. </p><p>She listened to the nearby group, talking of their boyfriends and girlfriends. They were laughing, the one girl talking fondly of her boyfriend. She could vomit. Young love, it was disgusting. She was already talking about marrying him. Not even nineteen years old and thinking of tying herself down to a boy of all things. From what she gathered, it was her first boyfriend, and if they did last– well, she admitted then they were the lucky ones.</p><p>In truth, Rio couldn’t even judge, having met her wife when they were freshmen and after six months of dating, Rio was ready for the U-Haul and to top a ring off for the cold woman she pulled. She didn’t, of course. They got married sometime after they graduated from their bachelors, when they both were twenty-four and starting their masters and PhDs. They already had their young love in a way, minus the casual ex from both of their high school days. </p><p>Rio tuned the conversations out as she grabbed the large stack of papers, passing out the packets to the groups when she reached their table. </p><p>“Dr. Vidal,” a bright voice made her look up. </p><p>She cocked her head at the girl. She was blonde, careful hazel eyes that shone with curiosity. In truth, she was Rio’s favorite when she wasn’t being fucking nosy. She did her work with precision, asked the right questions during lectures, and had the neatest handwriting out of all the dimwits that surrounded her. Not to mention, she didn’t stink. </p><p>“Yes?” she asked simply, not bothering to remember her name. </p><p>“Do you have a boyfriend?” she asked innocently. </p><p>She raised an eyebrow, surprised at her boldness and stupidness. She stared her down before slamming the packets on the table for them. </p><p>Clearing her throat, she kept her voice firm, “Rude to assume one’s sexuality, Miss…?” </p><p>“McGrath,” the girl swallowed hard, backing up slightly. </p><p>Rio’s sharp gaze never wavered as she stared down the student, her expression unchanging, but the weight of her words hung heavy in the air. She had dealt with this before, the intrusive questions, the casual overstepping of boundaries. But today, she wasn’t having it. </p><p>“Miss McGrath,” she repeated, her voice dripping with icy professionalism. “It’s also rude to ask personal questions in my classroom. If you’re here to learn about biology, I suggest you focus on the material. My personal life is none of your concern.” </p><p>The young woman’s face flushed a shade of red that was almost embarrassing, her eyes darting toward the other students who were now clearly trying to pretend they hadn’t been listening. </p><p>“I-I’m sorry, Dr. Vidal. I didn’t mean to offend you.” </p><p>Rio didn’t respond right away. She simply gave a curt nod and turned, returning to passing out the packets. She hated this feeling– of being baited into conversations she didn’t want to have. She was here to teach, not to be someone’s curiosity experiment. She went back to the front of the room, clearing her throat as the students settled, their eyes on her except for Miss McGrath who found her phone more interesting than class. </p><p><em> So, you’re not my favorite anymore, </em>Rio thought as her eyebrow raised, her gaze remaining on her, knowing the class would figure it out. </p><p>The kid next to McGrath elbowed her. She looked up, startled before returning her gaze back to her, her face a shade of crimson. </p><p>“May I remind you, that I have a no cell-phone policy unless it is an emergency which you may take outside. Now, I assume you all completed the notes without issue from my absence on Friday. Today, you will apply these notes for this lab. Microscopes are in front of you along with all the necessities for the lab. You have two hours to complete it, starting now. Any questions, comments, or concerns?” </p><p>No one answered.</p><p>Rio sat back at the podium, taking a long sip of her coffee as her eyes scanned over the scrambling students. They were all rushing, a mix of zippers opening, the rustles of papers, and chatter all starting up at once. She winced, holding her head as a dull ache started between her eyebrows. At least her juniors and seniors had their shit together while in lab.</p><p> </p><p>She ended up walking among them, fixing some of their microscopes and listening to their conversations, stepping in when they were wrong and nodding when a student had the answer right. Then, her hearing caught onto a different conversation. </p><p>“Woah, William, Harkness cancelled class again,” a voice said. </p><p>She whipped around at that, catching the boy’s computer screen that had her wife’s D2L pulled up. </p><p>The boy in question, William, turned from the microscope, “Again? I swear I saw her today.” </p><p>The other one shrugged, “As long as she doesn’t assign another paper tonight. I spent all weekend working on that.”</p><p><em> I bet you twenty she did, </em>Rio thought fondly before her eyebrows furrowed. </p><p>Her wife would never just cancel class on a whim, unless– as if on queue, she heard her phone ding from its place on the podium. There was only one person in her contacts list that was allowed in her phone settings to text her at this time. She felt eyes on her as she rushed to her phone, finding it was indeed her wife. </p><p> </p><p><b>Mi amor💜 : </b> <em> Sorry, I know you are in class. Morning sickness is hitting hard. Take me home after? </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio’s heart pounded in her chest as she was tempted to leave right then and there, but her students were half-way through a lab. She almost growled out loud, feeling the eyes on her as she stared at the text again, knowing her wife wouldn’t text like this. She took a deep breath, an idea sparking.</p><p>She held her phone close to her chest as she turned to the class, “If you will excuse me for a moment. I will be right back.”</p><p>She turned without waiting for their response, her long strides immediately taking her to Dr. Jennifer Kale’s office, the chemistry professor. She knocked loudly and repeatedly before the door opened roughly. </p><p>“Wha- Dr. Vidal?” Jen stared at her, her eyes wide as Rio didn’t wait for pleasantries. </p><p>“I need a favor. Can you watch over my class? They have about an hour left for their lab, but something at home came up.”</p><p>Jen cocked her head, “Is everything alright?” </p><p>“No, I wouldn’t be leaving class if it was,” she snapped, not able to help it. </p><p>Jen raised her head, her eyes squinting, debating if she wanted to snap back at her. </p><p>“Look, Dr. Kale, I wouldn’t be asking if it wasn’t urgent.” </p><p>Jen nodded her head slowly before holding her hand out for her to lead the way. Rio turned on her heel, marching back into her classroom as the student’s heads snapped up. </p><p>“Students, this is Dr. Kale, she will be in charge for the rest of class. I have a personal emergency. Dr. Kale, leave their packets in my mailbox,” Rio added as she grabbed her mug and coat from the podium chair. </p><p>Rio paused on her way out for a moment, glancing over her shoulder, “Thank you, Dr. Kale.”</p><p>She hurried back to her office, closing her laptop and throwing it into her bag before throwing on her coat. She grabbed her keys, locking her office behind her. Rio hurried across campus, her coat swishing behind her as her keys swayed in her grip. She barely registered the familiar faces she passed in the quad, her mind solely focused on getting to Agatha. She didn’t even register Wanda Maximoff, sitting on a bench, watching her make her way back into Poets’ Haven. </p><p><em> Morning sickness, my ass– she has been handling this like a champ until now, </em> she paused in her thoughts, the realization hitting her. <em> She would never text me over being a little nauseated, and mid-class?  </em></p><p>It had to be bad. </p><p>By the time she reached Agatha’s office in the literature department, she didn’t even bother to knock. She pushed the door open, her sharp gaze immediately softening when she found her wife curled up on the small couch against the wall. Agatha looked pale, her normally vibrant complexion dulled, and her hand rested on her stomach. Her face pressed into the purple cushions as her other hand gripped the side, seeming to fight off the discomfort she was feeling. </p><p>“<em> Mi vida </em>,” Rio said softly, stepping inside and closing the door behind her. </p><p>She was across the room in seconds, setting her keys aside before kneeling in front of her wife. Agatha looked up at her, offering a weak smile. </p><p>“You didn’t have to rush over, my love,” she said hoarsely. “I could have waited until after class.”</p><p>Rio cupped her face, brushing her thumb gingerly across her cheek, “Of course, I did. You’re more important than any class or lab.” </p><p>Her voice was firm, but her touch was infinitely tender. Agatha leaned into her hand, her eyes fluttering shut for a moment before she whispered, “It’s worse today. I tried to push through, but–” </p><p>“You don’t have to explain,” Rio interrupted softly. She stood, offering her hands, “Come on. Let me take you home.” </p><p>Agatha hesitated for a moment before accepting her wife’s help, allowing Rio to pull her to her feet. She swayed slightly, and Rio’s arm was around her waist in an instant, steadying her. </p><p>“Do you have everything?” Rio asked, glancing around the office. </p><p>Agatha nodded, “Just my bag.” </p><p>Rio grabbed it along with stuffing her keys in her pocket without letting go of her wife as they made their way out of the office. Agatha leaned into her as they walked, her head resting on Rio’s shoulder. </p><p>“Did you leave your students unattended?” Agatha teased weakly as they exited the building. </p><p>Rio huffed, “Dr. Kale is watching them. They’ll survive.” </p><p>Agatha chuckled softly, though it quickly faded into a sigh as they stepped into the chilly air. Rio adjusted her coat around her, pulling her closer. </p><p>“I’ll make you some tea when we get home,” Rio murmured, pressing a kiss to her temple the moment they were behind the building. </p><p>Agatha smiled up at her, “Thank you, my love.” </p><p>“Always,” Rio replied, her voice low and sincere as they headed to the car.</p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Wanda</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Wanda sat back on the bench, watching students in the quad move from class to class as their respective periods reigned on. She sighed, her gaze back up to the oak in the center of the quad, and in truth, her mind wasn’t even on the students. Wanda adored her work, she loved teaching the kids, but she never expected that a colleague would utterly capture her attention. Wanda closed her eyes for a moment, remembering the first time she met her. It was during the small faculty mixer before the semester started, professors from all departments in the ballroom at the top of the Student Center. She was in a purple dress, her movement powerful and demanding. She watched as most professors stepped back from her, watching her with hushed whispers before she approached a small group of professors in the corner. She watched from her hidden spot as they made small talk before the woman laughed, a note ringing over the clamor of the other professors. Her eyes– beautiful, piercing blue, and her hair long down her back. </p><p>She had tried to approach her by the end of night, finally taking up the courage to at least find out her name, until <em> she </em>came. Like a raven swooping from the shadows she was beside her, her gaze hard and firm. Doctor Rio Vidal, Dean of the faculty– the woman who hired her. She was callous, mean– even in the interview, Wanda had been unnerved at the sight of her. She was shocked when she received the email days later, telling her she was hired. She hoped it was the last she saw of the woman, unable to shake the awful feeling around her. </p><p>The next day, she was stunned to see the woman in her department, literature of all things. They had talked, briefly, but there was a certain warmness underneath the ice she forecasted. She hadn’t meant to fall for her, hadn’t wanted to. It was unprofessional, inappropriate even, and yet Wanda couldn’t help it. Agatha was magnetic. Her lectures were as compelling as they were brilliant, and she exuded a warmth during their fleeting meetings over syllabi and papers that was completely different from the practice, polished professionalism she maintained around other co-workers and students alike. Even the one day, Wanda remembered fondly, they both were recruited to judge a debate and it was the closest and longest she had been with her. The air was cold around her, her eyes sharp, attentive to students, but a different warmth came when she praised them. It was that warmth that undid Wanda, a sudden ache that crashed into her, and taking her breath away.  </p><p>Wanda had tried to drop subtle hints over the months– offering to walk with her to the faculty parking lot after meetings, leaving small compliments here and there about her lectures or the books she’d chosen for her syllabi. Hell, she even brought her coffee today and Agatha had simply stated she was on a diet, but nothing hurt worse than the obvious avoidance of lunch. It stung, it stung so much, that here she was, sitting on a bench, people watching to distract her thoughts. </p><p>A sharp laugh from a group of students nearby jolted Wanda from those said thoughts, and she let out a breath, shaking her head. </p><p><em> Pull yourself together, </em> she scolded herself silently. </p><p>She couldn’t let this… infatuation take over her life. Agatha was a colleague and someone who clearly didn’t want to go to lunch, but if it wasn’t for Rio Vidal… her blood boiled at the thought of her name. Rio had appeared around Agatha more often in the past week. It didn’t make sense. She was their boss and also a science professor, and from what she heard from the students, the Green Witch. Sure, Agatha was the purple witch of the literature department, but at least she had warmth and care for the students. As far as Wanda was concerned, Rio didn’t give a shit about students. She didn’t understand why Vidal had scheduled a meeting during Agatha’s lunch, and brought Olive Garden out of all things. </p><p><em> Do they know each other on a more personal level? </em> she wondered. <em> No, Rio is our boss.  </em></p><p>She thought back to the icy woman, the way she carried herself– it was intimidating. She was so sure of herself, so confident– she could walk through a crowd of students and they would all part for her. Her gaze swept across the quad, landing on a familiar figure as if her thoughts brought her to life. She squinted though, watching the woman rush through groups of students, not paying them a single glance as she about ran across the quad. Yet, the icy exterior was gone, replaced by something that almost looked like panic. She was rushing, her coat swishing behind her as her strides were long, purposeful. Wanda tilted her head, curiosity piqued. Vidal was hurried– if anything, she usually moved with a deliberate slowness that made everyone around her nervous. But now, the urgency was clear and the path was to Poets’ Haven.</p><p><em> Odd </em> , Wanda thought. <em> What’s got her in such a rush?  </em></p><p>She watched as Vidal disappeared into the building without so much as a glance at anyone around her. Wanda couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. Normally, she would have brushed it aside, but the tension in Vidal’s posture, the speed of her movements… it made Wanda’s heart pick up for reasons she couldn’t quite name. Wanda sat there for a moment longer, debating whether to follow. </p><p>She didn’t want to, and this wasn’t her business, but it was still her building. With a casual slowness, she made her way back into the building, using the main entrance in case she ran into the scary bitch. Still, the unease lingered, eating away at the edges of her thoughts as she made her way through the crowded halls, smiling at familiar students and professors alike. She forced herself to slow her pace, wondering if any of it had to do with the meeting Vidal had with Agatha. </p><p><em> What if she is in trouble? </em>she wondered, her thoughts moving to the absences that took place last week. </p><p>Wanda had shown up Thursday to find Agatha’s classes cancelled, all of her meetings pushed back, and Agatha gone without a word. It was the same Friday, except the Dean had left for a personal emergency before the day even started. As she made her way into the office hall, she found Agatha’s door shut, the lights off, and when she tried the door, it was effectively locked. From her memory, Agatha had class in thirty minutes and was always here pouring over her notes before the lecture. It was with freshmen, and she knew she gave the freshmen the hardest time of their lives. </p><p>“Dr. Maximoff,” a voice echoed behind her before she could turn to her office. </p><p>She spun around, meeting a boy with black curly hair, “Oh, hi William, how are you?” </p><p>He shrugged, “Okay, are you looking for Dr. Harkness? She announced on her D2L that class was cancelled again.”</p><p>“Oh,” Wanda tried keeping her professionalism in place as the student leaned against the wall rubbing his eyes. “Are you sure you’re alright, William?”</p><p>William wasn’t her student, but the boy had come to her the past few days among Agatha’s absence. He was struggling writing her essays, and Wanda could never say no to a student struggling. William had a brilliant mind, excellent ideas, just needed a little more guidance to connect the ideas on paper. From what she gathered, Agatha’s class was killing him. </p><p>“Yeah,” he sighed. “Dr. Vidal had us looking into microscopes for the last hour, not to mention she dipped half way through. Luckily, my group finished early, but still, we didn’t want to be there another hour with Dr. Kale who had no idea what was going on. We probably failed that lab without Dr. Vidal there. Her labs are hard, but like she is good at guiding us through it, without her, it was more straining.” </p><p>“What do you mean she ‘dipped’?” she couldn’t hide her curiosity as she crossed her arms. </p><p>He shook his shoulders, “I don’t know. Her phone went off and then next thing I know, Dr. Kale is shoved into the room and she’s gone. Something about a personal emergency, but I was wondering if you were free to help me? Dr. Harkness assigned us to make a draft of our next essay, and I don’t even know where to start.” </p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b>***</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p>Her mind raced as she checked the lasagna for the tenth time that night. Agatha was fine, but somehow, seeing her so pale, so clearly shaken and weak, hit Rio in a different way. She tongued her cheek, turning around and glancing back at the couch. She couldn’t see her, but she was there, having passed out the moment Rio set her down and wrapped a blanket around her. Rio glanced at the timer: twenty more minutes and dinner would be done. She turned back to her wife, wondering if she should wake her now. Slowly approaching, she glanced down from behind the couch, finding her wife had reached for her hoody that was haphazardly thrown on the couch yesterday. Her heart fluttered watching as her wife nuzzled into it, the color back to her cheeks and a sereneness overtaking her. </p><p>Walking around, Rio sat down on the edge of the couch, leaning over her as she brushed her hair away from her face. She was still in her work clothes, her makeup slightly smeared, and had the tiniest bit of drool by her lip that Rio quickly wiped away. Her wife groaned in her sleep, pulling her hoodie closer to her face before relaxing into the couch further. Rio’s heart fluttered as she chuckled, brushing more of hair away from her face before kissing her cheek softly. </p><p>“<em> Mi amor, es hora de despertar. La cena estará lista en veinte, </em>” she said, brushing her lips against her cheek again. </p><p>She watched as her wife smiled, before her eyes fluttered open, blues meeting hers. </p><p>“Hey, gorgeous,” Rio smiled down at her, making her wife roll her eyes. “How are you feeling?”</p><p>Her wife stretched, pulling the hoodie up to her nose and mumbling, “Better. The hoodie smells like you.” </p><p>Rio chuckled, kissing her head, “How about you go get a shower, then you can wear my hoodie, and after dinner, we can cuddle?” </p><p>Agatha’s lips curved into a soft smile, her voice still thick with sleep as she mumbled, “That’s a deal I can’t refuse.” </p><p>Rio stood, offering her hands to help her wife sit up. Agatha groaned as she stretched again, her movements slow but deliberate, shaking off the remnants of sleep. </p><p>“Take your time,” Rio said, brushing her thumb over Agatha’s knuckles once she was upright. “I’ll keep an eye on dinner.” </p><p>Agatha nodded, still holding onto Rio’s hands for a moment longer. </p><p>“Thank you,” she whispered, her voice filled with warmth. </p><p>Rio smiled and leaned down to kiss her lips. “Always, <em> mi amor </em>.” </p><p>Agatha headed to the bathroom, dragging her feet slightly, but with more color in her cheeks than earlier. Rio watched her until she disappeared down the hallway, her heart settling into a steadier rhythm now that her wife was on her feet and looking better. Just as Rio turned back to check the timer on the oven, a sudden knock at the door startled her. They rarely had visitors, especially unannounced visitors. The last time that happened, ended in the cops being called to drag Evanora Harkness away from them. She frowned, her steps hesitating as she smoothed out her sweatpants before grabbing Agatha’s purple flannel by the door and throwing it on over her sports bra. She turned to the mirror on the wall, the silver wire surrounding it contrasting with the dark polish of the walls. She fixed her hair out, adjusting her black rim glasses before cautiously cracking the door open. </p><p>Standing on her porch was Alice, looking concerned but with her usual playful smile. Behind her was Jennifer Kale, whose expression was far more confused than anything else. </p><p>“Alice,” Rio said, cracking the door only slightly more open before leaning against its frame. Her tone was cautious, protective, especially with Dr. Kale behind her. “And Dr. Kale. What do I owe for this unannounced visit?” </p><p>Alice cocked her head, the red streaks in her hair bright as she adjusted her black leather coat, “Really, Rio? You’re asking me that after you ran out of class like a bat out of hell, not to mention you thanked Jen.”</p><p>Rio scoffed, rolling her eyes, but her gaze remained on the chemistry professor who looked as if she were about to blow up with questions. </p><p>“Seriously, Rio, what’s going on?” Alice pressed.</p><p>She didn’t respond, still unnerved by the chemistry professor, “Why did you drag Dr. Kale here?”</p><p>Kale curled her lip, “I wasn’t dragged here, Alice said she was going to stop by a friend’s house to check in on them. I didn’t realize that friend was going to be our boss.” </p><p>Rio glared at Alice who cringed under it. </p><p>She raised her hands in mock-surrender, “Sorry, Rio. I know your whole thing with personal life and professional life, but um– actually I was gonna text the coven for drinks this Friday to meet my girlfriend, Jen.” </p><p>That, Rio hadn’t seen coming. She raised her eyebrows, looking between the two women before relaxing back against the frame, “Still doesn’t explain why you are here.”</p><p>Alice huffed, “‘Cause Jen mentioned you running out on a lab for an emergency, and you don’t do that. Can you blame me for wanting to check in?” </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes again, stepping back and allowing them in just as the timer went off. They followed her into the kitchen as she took off the flannel, throwing it to the back of the couch as she went. She opened the oven, pulling out the lasagna as Alice slid onto the bar stool of their black granite top island. Jen stood, awkwardly to the side, looking around the kitchen. Plants filled every corner, the ivy hung on their walls by the window, the stack of papers to the side that were hers to grade, and with Agatha’s reading glasses on the island. </p><p>“So, what’s going on?” Alice asked, sitting up straight as she watched Rio place the kettle on the stove. </p><p>Rio shrugged, “Just a personal emergency.” </p><p>“Rio, that’s not an explanation.” </p><p>She shrugged again, “And that’s all you’re getting from me, other than, I’m fine.” </p><p>Alice groaned, but her face practically screamed mischief, “Okay, then where’s your wife?”</p><p>Jennifer froze, her eyes widening as she turned to Rio, “<em> Wife </em>?! You’re married?” </p><p>Rio shot daggers at Alice, already feeling the impending headache, but simply set down the lasagna on the counter, taking out a knife. She ignored the question, feeling everything in her body tense. Alice knew the deal. Lilia knew the deal, but Jennifer? The fucking chemistry professor who had asked her out years ago before she realized Rio was her new boss? Agatha hated Jen after that, even though they had never met before that happened, but hated her the moment they did meet… who had the jealous streak now?</p><p>The kitchen felt suffocating under the silence, the stares heavy as even Alice remained silent, waiting for her to answer. She wasn’t ready for this– <em> none </em>of it. She was still worried about her wife, and worse, if she came out sick again– how would she explain that? The knife slightly shook in her hand as she finished cutting the squares, before setting it down and wiping her hands off with a towel. </p><p>“Is that really so hard to believe?” she asked slowly. </p><p>Jen nodded curtly, “Yes, you’re <em> you, </em>no offense. Plus, I have never seen a ring on your finger.” </p><p>Rio felt her gaze drift towards her room, where on the dresser both of their wedding rings sat. She hated not wearing it. The amethyst ring brought her comfort when she was away from her wife, but more importantly, in situations like this. She looked down, figuring to respond with something short, but Jen’s gaze was into her dining room. Rio raised an eyebrow as Jen glanced at her, silently asking to go in. </p><p>She followed the two women into the dining room, where plants adorned every corner. Against one bare wall stood a bookshelf overflowing with Agatha’s collection of books. On the opposite wall, large windows framed the cozy reading nook, filled with purple pillows and green blankets. But it was the other wall that captured Jennifer’s attention. A gallery of framed photos hung there, each telling a story of their life together. The largest, and Rio’s favorite, was of their wedding day, over ten years ago. It captured a moment from their intimate afterparty, during Rio and Agatha’s first dance as a married couple. Agatha, her hair styled with silver pins, held Rio’s face in her hands, while Rio’s arms encircled Agatha’s wrists. Rio wore a black suit with emerald green accents, a piece she had always loved. Jennifer’s gaze lingered on the picture of Rio and Agatha kissing, her eyes widening as her jaw dropped in disbelief.</p><p>Jen blinked, clearly taken aback. “Wait– that’s Dr. Agatha Harkness– the witch of the literature and language department?” </p><p>“Rude,” a voice echoed from the hallway. </p><p>They all whipped around, facing Agatha entering the room, her damp hair framing her face, and Rio’s hoodie enveloping her smaller frame. She moved with the same grace and precision as she did in the halls, but there was a casualness in her posture as she found her place next to Rio, leaning into her. Automatically, Rio wrapped her arm around her waist, her eyes softening at the sight of her wife relaxing. </p><p>“Well, if it isn’t the potions master,” Agatha snarked, her eyes dark with callousness as the two stared each other off. </p><p>“Agatha,” Jen faked her smile. “How are you? Horrible?” </p><p>“Woah, guys?” Alice stood between them. </p><p>Rio pulled Agatha closer, but chuckled, “These two have beefed as long as I can remember. It’s nothing new.”</p><p>Jen seethed, “She started it!”</p><p>Alice put her hand on Jen’s shoulder to calm her as Agatha merely mocked her. </p><p>“As much as I would love to continue” Alice trailed off for a moment “whatever this is, Rio and Agatha, we hope you both will join us with Lilia out this Friday.”</p><p>Rio nodded, “Of course. See you tomorrow, Dr. Kale.”</p><p>“And Rio, don’t think you got out of this conversation,” Alice smirked before disappearing out their door. </p><p>The moment the door clicked shut, her wife was in front of her, “What conversation? And why were <em> they </em> here?” </p><p>“Jen told Alice about me running out of the lab, and you know how protective and worried Alice can get,” she sighed looking down as her wife moved her hands up and down her shoulders. </p><p>Rio glanced up, meeting soft blues, “But why was Dr. Vegetable with her?”</p><p>She snorted, not able to help the laughter as she rolled her eyes, “Are you still mad that Jennifer flirted with me one time?”</p><p>“Huh huh,” her wife waved her finger in her face. “You don’t get to ask that after today.” </p><p>Her wife moved her hair, revealing the dark bruise just under her ear. Rio felt herself smirk, her hand reaching up and with a single finger, she brushed across it. </p><p>“A fucking hickey, really Rio?” she sighed, but Rio could tell there wasn’t any real malice to it. </p><p>She shrugged, “Just thought you could use the reminder. You’re mine.”</p><p>“Mmm,” her wife raised an eyebrow, and then to Rio’s surprise, she merely walked away. </p><p>Rio stood frozen, her eyes following Agatha as she sauntered into the kitchen, her hips swaying with a quiet confidence. Her eyes wandered, down to her bare legs, the careful curves in them, her pale skin glowing in the kitchen light. For a moment, Rio couldn’t help but watch her, caught off guard by the sudden change in energy. Agatha stopped by the stove, casually reaching for the tea kettle, but Rio could see the smirk tugging at the corner of her lips. It was the kind of smirk that promised trouble. She could feel the tension in the air, thickening with every second. </p><p>“You really think a hickey is enough to remind me who I belong to?” Agatha’s voice floated back to her, low and teasing. </p><p>She felt her heart flutter, a heat washing over her cheeks as she understood what her wife was doing to her. Agatha glanced over her shoulder, meeting Rio’s gaze with a challenge in her eyes. Rio slowly walked toward her, a slow smirk spreading across her face. </p><p>“I didn’t think it needed to be a big show,” she replied, stepping up behind Agatha. “But if you need a reminder, I’m happy to oblige.” </p><p>Her breath was warm against Agatha’s neck, her lips brushing the skin just behind her ear, just where the hickey lay. Agatha’s breath hitched, but she didn’t turn around, keeping her posture casual, even though Rio could feel the shift in her. </p><p>“I think you might’ve just made things more interesting,” she whispered, a playful but dangerous edge in her tone. “And now, I’m going to make you regret that little display.” </p><p>Rio’s hands rested lightly on Agatha’s waist, her fingers dancing along the fabric of her sweatshirt. She could feel the electricity spark into her fingertips, the way her wife’s body naturally leaned into her touch. She would never tire of this, and part of her had hoped when she left that mark on her, she would cause a little something tonight… despite the rude interruption. </p><p>“Oh, I don’t regret it, <em> mi amor </em>,” she murmured, her fingers slowly tugging up on the sweatshirt to feel the rough texture of lace. “But you’re right... we’re not done here yet.” </p><p>Agatha finally turned to face her, her eyes dark with a hint of something more. </p><p>She leaned in close, her lips brushing Rio’s ear as she spoke, “Don’t worry, darling. You’ll have plenty of chances to pay for that later.” </p><p>Rio chuckled and she fully grabbed her wife’s waist, pulling her flush against her. Her own lips trail up her wife’s neck, placing a kiss right over the hickey and revelling in how her wife melted into her arms.</p><p>“Looking forward to it, <em> cariño </em>,” she husked, her voice thick and heavy. </p>

<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Her plan was perfect, flawless… well, almost. </p><p> </p><p>The only obstacle to the plan?</p><p> </p><p>The subject herself.</p><p> </p><p>Rio Harkness-Vidal. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha knew exactly how to draw the right reactions out of her wife. </p><p>Cupping her face in her hands: <u> relaxation and Rio grasping gently at her wrists </u>.</p><p>A simple kiss to her lips: <u> a smile </u>.</p><p>Hands on her ass: <u>Rio would melt into her</u>.</p><p>A kiss to the side of Rio’s neck: <u> a sigh </u>.</p><p>A small nibble to her ear: <u> a hitch of breath </u>.</p><p>Sucking right at the junction of her neck and shoulder: <u> a stifled moan </u>.</p><p>A bite to her collarbone: <u> a moan </u>.</p><p>Her tongue inside Rio’s mouth: <u> her back against the nearest surface </u>. </p><p>Although fifteen years of experience helped, it didn’t take long to find subtle ways to unravel her wife, and push her until she snapped. But when Rio snapped, she was in control… but not for long. It was always a fight, one they both enjoyed, the gentle push and pull for power between them most nights. Her wedding night was the one exception; she didn’t fight Rio hard enough for her power back. She had simply waited for the night to run its course until she was on top. Morning sex, make-up sex, and sometimes when the emotions were high, neither fought for control. For Agatha, their sex life was perfect: a well balanced blend of power and letting go. </p><p>Neither were really the top, despite what others thought– <em> looking at you my darling reader. </em></p><p>Tonight would be different. It had to be for the stunt her wife pulled in her office. She had spent the last twenty minutes of her time trying to hide the damn hickey with her make-up before struggling to keep her hair in place. During her lecture, she remained seated, too nervous to walk in front of the room with her original flair in fear that students would see it. The students were a gossipy, nosy bunch this semester, even her returning students. Something was oddly in the air. </p><p>Nonetheless, tonight had to be different. Although it was cruel, and risky, she was going to return the favor, but that also meant distracting Rio from it. If Rio was too focused on her own pleasure, then her wife wouldn’t notice the bruise she planned on marking her with. She would use her wife’s own tactics against her. She had learned quickly in their relationship how much Rio loved putting her tongue on Agatha; whether it was playfully licking her hand, licking the side of her cheek just to cause a reaction, or if it was taking that tongue, and licking down her body and to where Rio would happily sit, kneel, or lay between Agatha’s legs. </p><p>For a moment, she thought fondly of their first time ever together. It was in Rio’s dorm room late at night. Rio had invited her for a movie and cuddling since her roommate was gone for the weekend. Agatha originally had been the one to initiate it: making out like love-sick teenagers instead of watching the movie. She had laid in the center of Rio’s bed, Rio laying beside her, pulling her closer. She didn’t particularly remember how it escalated, but she remembered nodding at her girlfriend, finally telling her she was ready. Rio was more reserved then, gentle, hesitant even, but Agatha still awoke to her neck and chest covered in bruises, more as if she had been in a fight with an octopus than sleeping with her girlfriend. </p><p>Needless to say, Rio loved marking her– with her tongue, her teeth, her lips– but she wouldn’t get the chance tonight. No, Agatha’s plan was already in motion. She waited until dinner was done, their conversation casual, as if the previous threats in the kitchen didn’t even happen. They talked about the upcoming Friday outing, Rio mentioning that Alice and Jen were together and was the reason for this outing. Then, she fought Agatha on the fact that she wasn’t going to drink either; claiming, “we are in this together, <em> mi amor. </em>” Agatha had only sighed, accepting her defeat with this conversation. Their excuse? They had to wake up early in the morning to drive to Pennsylvania where Rio’s family lived and couldn’t do it if either of them had headaches when they woke up. Then, they talked of the baby– the ultrasound and how after, they would announce the pregnancy by sending a simple photo of the ultrasound picture to their group chat with nothing else said. </p><p>Cryptic: the Harkness-Vidal signature. </p><p>When Rio stood, taking their plates into the kitchen, Agatha bided her time, listening to drawers opening before the sound of the fridge opening and closing. Then, the water started in the sink and Agatha made her move. She moved slowly, forcing her feet to be lighter on the hardwood as she rounded the center counter and behind her wife who was too busy washing their plates. She was quick, her body humming in excitement and heat in her cheeks as she pushed up against her wife, trapping her between the sink and her. Her hands were between them, on Rio’s round ass, squeezing lightly through her sweats. Rio melted, her body moving distinctly back against her as the fork slipped from her grip and back into the water. Before her wife could protest, her hands slipped up her body, moving over a ripple of bare abs, up over her constricted breasts, and around her shoulders. She continued, moving her wife’s hair away from her neck and kissing it tenderly. Rio sighed, the breath leaving her body, her defenses taken down. Agatha smirked, not able to hide it as her plan was working perfectly. </p><p>Phase two she was a little more hesitant about. Rio was more prone to licking and sometimes her wife wondered if she had married a cat instead, but Rio was never on the receiving end… other than when she sat on Agatha’s face. For Agatha, a tongue across the expanse of her neck– she was a puddle in her wife’s arms. But for Rio? There was only one way to find out. Swallowing her nerves, also a bit of her pride, she breathed along her neck, getting her to tilt her head before she let her tongue out. She was slow, tasting the perfect pine and earthy hint of Rio.</p><p>Her wife stiffened. </p><p>Her posture rigid as the sponge fell out of hand, landing into the water with a small splash. </p><p>Agatha froze. Her heart raced as her wife didn’t move, didn’t react right away and all of her confidence melted. The original excitement died, something else dropping into the pit of her stomach as she stepped back slightly, ready for her wife to question her. Just as she did, her wife whipped around. Agatha blinked, staring at her wife’s dilated pupils, the blacks swallowing those adoring brown eyes. Before she could react, a mouth clashed with hers, a tongue wrestling with her own. She heard herself moan, her body immediately giving into her wife as Rio’s tongue tangled with her own before exploring her mouth like she never did before. Heat rushed through Agatha’s body, her desire returning stronger, burning through her very body as her wife barely pulled away enough for them to breathe before her tongue was back in her mouth. </p><p>Rio was starving, as if she hadn’t eaten in weeks… well, acting as if they hadn’t fucked the last night, or the night before that– acting as if she hadn’t seen her wife in centuries. Rough, hot hands wandered her body, lifting up the sweatshirt she wore and fisting at her underwear. Then, the hands were on her ass, lifting her up without breaking the kiss. She gasped into her mouth, but didn’t pull away as her legs wrapped around Rio’s waist, allowing her to carry them through the home. They didn’t break the kiss once as Rio made it into their room, setting her down on the bed. Rio made quick work of her sweatshirt, and about growled seeing Agatha wasn’t wearing a bra underneath the oversized-sweatshirt. Her nipples hardened to the chill of the air, and to Mother did they hurt. Her wife was on her, moving her back on the bed and straddling over her lap. Their lips connected harshly, Rio already moving up her hands to cup her breasts tenderly. Her body twitched, her chest pushing into her hands as their tongues met in a careful dance of tangling together, exchanging a decent amount of saliva that Rio simply wiped away with the pad of her thumb against her chin.</p><p>Her body arched into her wife, a need burning through her as everything in her screamed for more. Her hips rolled up, searching for any bit of release. Her wife ignored her, her hands hot, everywhere– on her breasts, palming a nipple that had her release a louder whine into her mouth. Agatha’s own hands ran up and down her wife’s back, pulling at sports bra, moving under the hem of her sweatpants before tangling in her hair. Her brain was foggy, a puddle of want and need for the woman above her. She whined more into her mouth, feeling her wife smirk against her but their tongues never left. </p><p>It was wet and desperate. </p><p>Every sound from her, every move, and every flick of her tongue made for her wife– begging her wife for more. She whined again– and Agatha never whined, until now apparently as the taste, the touch, the very smell of Rio made her press her thighs together, hoping to settle the ache between her legs that conquered her. As her thighs squeezed together, she felt it. She was wet– desperately, achingly, deliriously soaked. It already coated the side of her thighs. As if Rio sensed her, a hand moved down her breast, down her stomach, and underneath her the now, uselessly soaked lace. Rio’s fingers moved past the patch of hair and when Rio finally, finally touched her, Rio moaned. </p><p>“Fuck– oh baby, you’re so wet,” she husked before her mouth was back on her lips.</p><p>Agatha whined– she fucking whined again. She knew she was going to regret this later– the whining part specifically. Her wife was going to hold this over her for a very long time, but at the time she couldn’t bring herself to care as her hips lifted up, begging for Rio’s long fingers. The want was overpowering, everything in her begging that every move be made for the woman over her. Her fingers moved, two promptly slipping inside her without resistance. </p><p>Rio chuckled darkly, “Is this all for me?” </p><p>Agatha nodded, refusing to leave her wife’s gaze, but Rio wasn’t having it. </p><p>“Let me hear you, <em> cariño </em>.” </p><p>Rio fingers moved at a steady pace in and out of her. She gasped, her blunt nails digging into her shoulders, leaving crescents in their wake. She sucked in her bottom lip as Rio moved a little rougher, her eyes never leaving Agatha’s. </p><p>“<em> Cariño, </em>” her wife drawled. “You were so vocal before, tell me, is this all for me?”</p><p>Agatha gave in, sucking in her breath, “Yes, yes! All for you!” </p><p>Rio’s eyes glinted with something wicked before her fingers slipped out of her. Agatha groaned at the sudden loss, sitting up, ready to ask why she stopped, but she was met with Rio’s fingers in front of her mouth. She stared at them for a second before her mouth opened without a thought. They entered her mouth and without another word spoken, her tongue moved around them, her cheeks hollowing as she sucked them clean, never leaving the dark eyes that bore down at her. Rio’s eyes darkened, pulling her fingers out of her mouth, leaving a slight salty tang. </p><p>“Good girl,” she purred, already moving down her body with her tongue hot on her. </p><p>Agatha fell back into the pillows, watching as her wife took her teeth, pulling her ruined thong off down her legs and throwing it behind her. Before her wife could tell her, her legs were already spreading, opening herself up to her. The air was cold against her heat, enlisting a shiver to run through her, but the shiver was short lived as something hot was licking her up from opening to her clit. She moaned loud, louder than ever before and her wife had done this hundreds of times. Her hips bucked, but Rio merely pinned her place with her hands on her hips. </p><p>“<em> Paciencia, mi amor, </em>” her wife murmured and Agatha whined. </p><p>
<em> Fuck her and her fucking Spanish.  </em>
</p><p>Sharp nips to her thighs made her quiver before one was sharp enough that made her leg jump back. Rio was quick to soothe it with her tongue, switching to her thigh and doing the same. Her tongue ran all along her thighs, seeming to drink in her arousal. Agatha squirmed, her hands fisting quilt underneath her as her wife continued to tease her.</p><p>“Please, Rio– please, my love,” the words left her mouth without her permission. </p><p>Agatha needed her. Everything demanded to point it almost hurt. She felt tears run down her cheeks, and she kept her head back, not wanting her wife to see or she would stop out of concern. </p><p>“Please, please, please, my love–” she begged again until she felt it. </p><p>Her moans cut her pleading off, feeling her wife’s tongue swirl through her folds, hitting every nerve. Rio caught onto her desperation, her tongue flicking over her clit before moving down and moving inside her. Her back arched, shoving down on her wife’s face as her hand shot down into Rio’s hair. To her surprise, her wife didn’t correct. Instead, her mouth returned to her clit and three fingers pressed inside her. </p><p>“Fuck, fuck– Rio!” she moaned, her hips cantering down and meeting Rio’s thrusts. </p><p>She gathered Rio’s hair, pulling her harder against her, feeling her flick her tongue faster until sucking hard enough, Agatha saw stars. She screamed something between a moan and Rio’s name, the knot in her stomach exploding, pulsing pleasure through her body. </p><p>Rio didn’t stop. </p><p>Her fingers pumped in and out of her faster, bringing the knot back in her stomach as her lips wrapped around her clit. Agatha didn’t get a chance to come down, chasing her second orgasm of the night. At that moment, Agatha was grateful they no longer lived in an apartment or a dorm. They were in their home, the wet obscene sounds bouncing off the walls over her moans. With a final hard suck, white washed over her. Her body arched up. Her head tipped back. Her eyes squeezed shut, and everything became hazy as she squirted around her wife’s fingers. </p><p>Agatha heard herself whimper, feeling the loss from Rio’s fingers leaving her. Then, that tongue was there, cleaning her thighs and lapping at her before Agatha reached down in her haze. She twitched under her wife’s tongue, overstimulated. She found Rio’s head, placing her hand on top, a silent gesture to stop. Rio did, her kisses moving over her stomach before her hand came up, rubbing over the non-existent bump. Agatha smiled weakly, tears welling in her eyes as Rio’s hand moved in a small circle before her kisses reached her mouth. She tasted herself on Rio’s tongue, sighing into the kiss as her wife pulled her closer into her protective embrace. Thumbs brushed along her cheeks, wiping away the tears that continued to fall. </p><p>Rio pulled away sharply, “<em> Mi amor ¿qué ocurre? ¿Estás bien? ¿Hice algo mal?” </em></p><p>She opened her eyes, finding brown ones wide with concern. Rio wiped her tears again, her hand brushing strands of her hair away. Agatha shook her head, trying to calm down, but found her words stuck. Her wife held her, peppering kisses along her cheeks and to her lips, whispering soft nothings until Agatha caught her breath. </p><p>“I’m okay,” she whispered, Rio staring deep into her soul, looking for a hint of a lie. “It’s just the pregnancy hormones.” </p><p>Rio gave her that lopsided smile she had when she was pleased with herself before kissing her lips tenderly. Agatha pulled Rio further against her before groaning at the feel of clothes against her. </p><p>“Take off,” she muttered between kisses, knowing her wife understood. </p><p>Rio sat up, lifting off her sports bra before standing to drop her pants and boxers in one motion. She crawled back up Agatha’s body, leaving kisses, nips with her teeth, and soothing of a tongue as she went. Their lips met again, Agatha licking at Rio’s bottom lip and tangling her tongue with hers. Rio moaned into her, their bodies pressed together, well there was a hesitance from Rio. Normally, her wife would press fully into her, pinning her to the mattress, but now she held herself up. Agatha tried pulling her closer, but her wife resisted… <em> Rio </em> had the fucking audacity to resist her pulling <em> her </em>closer. With a growl, Agatha flipped them, pinning her wife into the mattress. Rio only smiled into her, hands moving up and down Agatha’s back, sending shivers as nails lightly scratched her.  </p><p>Agatha moved slowly, her hand trailing down to pinch her nipples, forcing a strangled moan from her mouth. She continued pinch, twisting, listening to the delightful notes from her wife. Rio arched into her, a growl echoing from her mouth. Agatha chuckled, her hand trailing slowly over her abs before moving over the patch of hair. She circled through the wiry black, twirling the hair before moving her fingers through soaked folds. They both moaned. Agatha felt her fingers being swallowed before moving her hand up and finding her swollen clit. </p><p>“<em> ¡Mierda! Mi amor, más,” </em>Rio moaned, her hips lifting up against Agatha’s hand. </p><p>Agatha smirked, moving her lips down Rio’s jaw and to her breasts. As soon as her lips wrapped around her nipple, she moved two fingers inside her. Rio clawed at her back, nails digging so deep, she was sure there would be marks. She didn’t care, sucking and mouthing over her wife’s breasts as her fingers plunged into her, feeling her squeeze around her. She listened to the sweet notes from her wife, beautiful music chorusing with the delicious wet slapping. Spanish filled the room, an incoherent babble before she moaned louder, Agatha adding another finger.</p><p> “<em> Por favor, por favor, cariño!” </em></p><p>Agatha moved her mouth to Rio’s other boob, sucking dark marks into her skin before finding her hardened nipple, her teeth grazing over it. Rio arched further into her, babbling and moaning. With a smirk, Agatha pressed her thumb to her clit, sending Rio over the edge. Her pussy clamped down on her, her fingers trapped for a moment before she felt her cum coat her hand. Yet, her fingers kept working, curling to lead her through it. </p><p>“<em> ¡Mierda! </em>Agatha!” </p><p>Agatha pulled away, kissing up her wife’s neck to her lips before slowly pulling her fingers free. Rio cupped her jaw, holding her close. Warmth spread through her, her heart solely beating for the woman underneath her. Then, Agatha grunted, her back on the quilts again. Her wife smirked into her and pulled away and out of her grasp before she could protest. Rio moved to their dresser as Agatha licked her finger clean, watching her wife pull her strap out and sliding the harness up her muscular legs. As Rio adjusted the buckles, Agatha caught her breath, falling out the haze as she realized her plan; the whole point that she and Rio ended up entangled tonight, but it was too late. Rio had quite literally swept her off her feet, her mind only comprehending the woman that was between her legs, inside her– the woman she was inside of and the sweet honey that coated her fingers, her tongue was now lapping at. </p><p>The shift in the bed caught her attention again, Rio climbing on and settling between her legs. Agatha reached out, taking one of Rio’s hands as their eyes locked. She smirked, watching her wife who coated the thick green strap with lube, pump her hand around it. Then, her wife moved, looming over her as their lips locked softer this time. She smiled against her, nodding her head slightly, signalling her wife to move. Rio was slow this time, grasping the dildo in hand and pushing it in slowly. </p><p>“Fuck, Rio,” she gasped, her hand locking tighter on hers while her other clutched at her wife’s back. </p><p>Lips moved along her jaw as the strap pushed further into her, making her feel full– completed. Rio waited, her lips brushing along her neck before reaching her lips again. Agatha stretched out her fingers, before moving them up on Rio’s back, another silent plea for her to move. Her wife listened, pulling out slowly before pushing in again. Agatha felt her mouth fall open, her legs falling a little wider as Rio kept slow deep thrusts, filling her completely before almost pulling out. Rio’s eyes were dark, the light from the moon, making her eyes shine dimly, but Agatha saw it all: the possession, the desire, the love… For some reason, that was all it took. The knot in her stomach released and she squeezed around the dildo. Her hips pressed up as her fingers intertwined with Rio’s. </p><p>“Rio,” she gasped through it. </p><p>When she came down, she expected her wife to tease her for cumming so fast, but Rio only looked down at her with adoration. Their lips met gentler, Agatha’s heart skipped a beat as her wife continued with slow, measured thrusts, moaning into her mouth. </p><p>Agatha managed to pull away, finding those deep rich soil eyes, “Faster, please, my love.”  </p><p>Rio’s eyes darkened again, their fingers untwining as Agatha wrapped her arms around muscular shoulders. Her ankles locked around Rio as her thrusts became faster. The sound of the headboard rocking against the wall, the raw wet slapping of skin on skin, the way Rio was hitting everything inside her so perfectly– it was too much. Agatha found the side where her wife’s shoulder met her neck, biting down to contain her moans. Rio moaned herself, her pace quickening as her shoulders tensed under Agatha’s fingers. Hips dug into hers with every thrust and for a few moments, she met her thrusts– their bodies moving in sync, their moans loud and wanton as Rio’s body moved against her. It was electrifying, feeling her wife inside her, filling her completely, her cock scraping against her walls, and then Rio’s body on top of her, even the slight iron taste in her mouth as she sucked and bit at her skin as if her life depended on it. It was the only anchor as white hot waves of pleasures crashed into her body over and over again. </p><p>Something else filled Agatha, a warmth hitting her square in the chest before encircling her body. The world faded out, everything forgotten in the moment as her wife thrusted into her. All it mattered was her and her wife… them and their love. </p><p>Agatha bit down harder into her wife when she came, her body stilling, but Rio kept moving until with a final thrust her name was screamed into the room. </p><p>Hot breath panted above her. Her wife’s body trembling between holding herself up and the aftershocks. </p><p>The room was hot, smelling strongly of sex. The only sounds were them panting, catching their breath as the world came back, but the love stayed. Slowly, Agatha removed her mouth from her wife’s skin, kissing and licking it over in apology as her hand found Rio’s waist, helping in holding her up before Rio pulled back. Unsteadily, she sat up, pulling out and collapsing down beside her. Agatha smiled, pulling her wife close as they laid there together, taking in the silence as they searched for their breath. </p><p>A pleasant ache set into Agatha’s body, a tiredness washing over as she soon realized she was fighting to keep her eyes open. Rio and her have fucked for longer and way rougher, but for some reason, Agatha felt depleted but completed. Her body hummed, the warmth– the love settling into her very bones as her hand found her stomach, her thumb brushing small circles over it before Rio’s hand rested over hers, calming her. She smiled as her wife leaned over, kissing cheek. The thump and rattle of metal made her snap her eyes open, realizing her wife had stood, dropping the strap unceremoniously to the floor. She groaned as Rio managed to pull the quilt out from under her, also thrown to the floor before a blanket wrapped around her. Then, her wife picked up the strap, taking it to their bathroom to clean it. </p><p>Her eyes jolted open again as the bed dipped with added weight. Rio had joined her, wrapping strong arms around her and pulling her close. Agatha’s head came to rest on Rio’s shoulder, and she felt the warmth of gentle kisses placed on her forehead, trailing down to her nose. When Rio’s lips hovered near hers, Agatha lifted her head slightly to meet the kiss. </p><p>“I love you,” she whispered softly when they pulled apart, her voice laced with affection and a tired contentment. </p><p>Rio smiled, her lips brushing against Agatha’s again before she chuckled, “I love you too, but I see your little payback plan worked.” </p><p>“Mmm?” Agatha hummed sleepily, her eyes already beginning to close again, her body sinking further into Rio’s embrace. </p><p>“You’re going to have to help me with makeup tomorrow.” </p><p>Agatha’s eyes shot open, the words pulling her to full awareness. She tilted her head, her gaze scanning Rio’s skin in the faint light of the moon. A satisfied grin tugged at her lips as she spotted the dark bruises marring Rio’s chest and sternum. But then her eyes caught the mark on Rio’s neck– a deep, angry blend of blue and purple, with a hint of red. </p><p>That was a problem. </p><p>But it was also… her goal…? </p><p>Reaching up, Agatha brushed her fingertips over the bruise, but before she could properly assess it, Rio flinched. A moment later, Rio’s hand came up, intertwining their fingers and pulling them gently away from the mark. </p><p>“Careful,” Rio murmured, though her tone carried a trace of amusement. “It’s tender.” </p><p>Agatha bit her lip, trying to stifle a giggle, but the gleam in her eyes betrayed her satisfaction. </p><p>“Oops,” she said innocently, though the smirk tugging at the corner of her mouth was anything but. </p><p>Rio shook her head, a quiet laugh rumbling in her chest, “You really went for it, huh?” </p><p>Agatha gave a nonchalant shrug, nestling closer against her wife. </p><p>“Consider it justice for marking my neck right before a lecture,” she quipped, her voice muffled against Rio’s shoulder. </p><p>Rio pressed another kiss to Agatha’s forehead, humming slightly, but she didn’t respond. Instead, her hand came down, resting on Agatha’s stomach, circling the non-existent bump once more. Agatha smiled, holding her wife closer as she slowly drifted into sleep, exhaustion catching up to her, but as her eyes closed, her thoughts wandered. </p><p>The plan was perfect, until it wasn’t… </p><p>well… </p><p>Agatha wanted sole control over Rio, a small punishment for the hickey right before the lecture before Rio received her own mark on her skin. </p><p> </p><p>Mission failed successfully. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha placed her mark alright, but she lost control. </p><p>Instead, she learned something about her wife that night… </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Licking her neck: <u> one-way ticket to getting railed </u>.</p>

<b>Rio</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio was pissed. </p><p> </p><p>Unfairly…fairly…so…? </p><p> </p><p>She groaned, pushing her hair back with her fingers as she stared at herself in the bathroom mirror. Her chest was covered in dark bruises, her hair dishevelled, and her body had a pleasant ache. She felt the slight knot in her back, and growled at herself. She wasn’t that old– hell she wasn’t old at all and yet, she felt like she pulled something in her lower back and she had an odd twist in her neck. She rubbed it, but stared at the other side, and felt herself bristle more. She had warranted it– deserved it. She admitted that at least. She shouldn’t have given her wife the hickey before she left for class, risking all the rules that <em> she </em>placed. She couldn’t afford the slip up now, but this was worse. This was unprofessional. She wasn’t a love-struck teen or even in her early twenties anymore. Fuck, it wasn’t even summer, when she would have worn it proudly. Agatha had never marked her like this before. </p><p>A small smile tugged on the corner of her lips, betraying her frustration. Her gaze lingering on the strap that sat next to the sink, left to dry after she cleaned it last night. It was one of the bigger ones in their collection, and her wife hadn’t even seemed to notice last night. Then, her mind flashed to the kitchen, when she felt the jolt through her whole body when her wife’s tongue moved across her neck. She eyed the doorway, peering in where her wife still slept soundly in bed. She had been pleasantly surprised, but the way everything in her gathered, the unbearable heat in her stomach, and everything in her body begging to take Agatha then and there. In truth, she contained herself. She didn’t press as hard against her as her wife liked, nor threw her around with ease, no. Through the haze of want and desire, one thought remained constant in the back of her mind: the baby. </p><p>She couldn’t be as rough in fear of hurting her wife or their baby. She wouldn’t risk it, even though her wife was practically play-dough, left for her to mold, and shape her as she pleased without resistance. </p><p>Rio gazed back in the mirror, her thoughts darkening as she stared at the mark. It was a deep blue, purple dotting her skin and up her neck. A turtleneck would hide most of it, but not all of it and the thought of those teenagers seeing it made her blood boil it. Her older students wouldn’t have cared if they noticed it, but for some reason, she had a feeling the freshmen would gossip. She already lost their secret to Jennifer fucking Kale, and worse, Kale and her worked quite often together. </p><p>But as her thoughts circled back to the mark, a smirk tugged at her lips. A part of her– the possessive, primal part– relished the idea of people seeing it. She imagined Wanda Maximoff catching a glimpse and bristling in quiet frustration. Good. Let her. If Maximoff was going to invade their personal bubble by flirting with <em> her pregnant wife </em>, she might as well know how Rio was Agatha’s as Agatha’s was hers. Her eyes glinted, imagining being her wife’s office, pressing her softly to the desk, purposely leaving the door cracked and that fucking red head walking in. And as Rio would turn, she would bare the mark proudly. Yet, her grip on the counter hardened, her knuckles whiting as she thought of that infuriating bitch. She couldn’t risk their marriage getting out yet, not until Agatha was showing and they would deal with it then, but every thought of the red-headed professor looking at her wife, talking to her, touching– Rio let out a low snarl in the back of her throat before shaking out of it. </p><p>Rio rolled her shoulders, finally turning away from the mirror and stepping back into the bedroom. Agatha stirred slightly, her hand moving to rest on the curve of her belly… Rio’s eyes widened as she stared at her belly. She froze in place, her gaze locked on Agatha’s belly as if it had revealed some great secret. Her mind raced, cataloging every bit of information she knew about pregnancies. Six weeks was far too early to show anything significant, wasn’t it? Maybe Agatha had just eaten something salty in the middle of the night while she slept, or perhaps it was bloating from the hormones. But her rationalizations did little to calm the sudden surge of protectiveness that rose in her chest. She stepped closer, sitting on the edge of the bed with deliberate care, her movements slow as if not to disturb Agatha. Her fingers brushed softly over the curve, her touch feather-light. Agatha stirred again, a faint smile curling her lips even as her eyes remained closed.</p><p> “<em> Mi amor </em>,” Rio murmured, her voice barely above a whisper. </p><p>Agatha’s eyes fluttered open, her smile widening as she registered her wife’s presence. </p><p>“Mmm, good morning,” she said sleepily, her voice thick with warmth that made Rio’s heart flutter. </p><p>Her hand lingered on her stomach, her gaze flicking between Agatha’s face and the gentle swell. She was beautiful, her face relaxed from sleep, slightly glowing. Her hair was a mess across the pillows, but thicker and shinier. Then, Rio’s gaze lingered back on her stomach, still unsure if this was normal. </p><p>“Good morning,” she said, her tone carrying a mix of awe and concern. “Are you… feeling okay? Is this normal?” </p><p>Agatha followed Rio’s gaze down to her stomach, her brow furrowing slightly before realization dawned on her. She chuckled softly, placing her hand over Rio’s. </p><p>“It’s normal, <em> cariño </em>. Hormonal changes can cause bloating early on. Nothing to worry about.” </p><p>Rio exhaled a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding, but her hand remained where it was, her thumb tracing slow circles over Agatha’s skin. </p><p>“You’re sure?” she asked, her voice soft but insistent. </p><p>Agatha nodded, her other hand reaching up to cup Rio’s cheek, “I’m sure. You’re going to be hovering over me for the next eight months, aren’t you?” </p><p>Rio smirked, leaning into Agatha’s touch, “Absolutely. You and our baby are my world.” </p><p>Agatha laughed, her eyes shining with affection, “I wouldn’t expect anything less.” </p><p>Rio leaned down, pressing a gentle kiss to Agatha’s lips before resting her forehead against hers. </p><p>“You’re glowing,” she murmured. </p><p>Agatha smiled in return, placing another kiss, “You’re biased.” </p><p>“Of course,” she teased back, her hand moving in gentle circles over her stomach. “But, I’ll start prepping smaller meals for you to eat throughout the day. That should help with the bloating and the morning sickness.” </p><p>Agatha groaned dramatically, but her grin betrayed her amusement, “Fine, but only if you promise to stop glaring at yourself in the mirror like it personally attacked you.” </p><p>Rio blinked, momentarily caught off guard, “You saw that?” </p><p>Agatha’s laughter filled the room, warm and melodic, “Of course I did. Now, you said last night you needed help with makeup, my love?” </p><p>She nodded, reaching her hand out for her wife. Agatha took it, swinging her legs over and standing beside Rio before freezing for a moment, her hand on her stomach. </p><p>“Get dressed first, and give me a moment.” </p><p>Before she could protest, her wife ran to the bathroom, leaning over the sink and puking. Rio was behind her in seconds, pulling her hair back and rubbing her back softly. Her voice whispered a gentle coaxing as her heart tightened, seeing her wife like this. If it were possible, Rio would siphon all of her side effects, wishing she could do more to make this easier on her wife. But alas she could not, she instead stood with her, taking a glass of water she had already poured last night for her wife.</p><p>When Agatha pulled away, she nodded Rio out, “Come on, get dressed and grab an outfit for me. I’ll do your makeup today.” </p><p>For a moment, an irritation flew across her features and she didn’t bother to hide it. The mark still slightly stung and the thought of makeup on it would only make it worse. Her wife, her ever attentive wife noticed, and placed a soft kiss on her cheek.</p><p>“You know…” her words trailed off as a blush crept in. “I-I didn’t– um, I didn’t mean to do it like that.” </p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, crossing her arms, “Really?” </p><p>She bit back the rest of her retort, knowing not to anger her pregnant wife.</p><p>Agatha looked away, the red bright in her cheeks as she bit her lip, “Well, I wouldn’t have placed it that high or uh- deep. Someone else just got carried away last night.” </p><p>She rolled her eyes, “Yes, it’s my fault, sweetheart.” </p><p>Her wife snapped her head back up at that, her face still red, “It <em> is </em>your fault. If you weren’t so damn good–”</p><p>Agatha stopped herself, making Rio bark out her laughter, “Careful, <em> mi amor, </em>don’t want to go admitting something so unremarkably true.”</p><p>She set her hands on her wife’s waist, pulling her closer, her eyes glinting. Her memories flashed through their night, the sweet music she could rarely pull out of her wife, echoing loudly in her ears.</p><p>“Although, those whines were beautiful for me last night. So, desperate–” </p><p>“For the love of– Rio!” Agatha hissed, her voice a mix of embarrassment and indignation as she tried to push past her wife. </p><p>Rio caught her easily, her arms wrapping around Agatha’s waist to pull her back in. </p><p>“What? I’m just stating facts, <em> mi amor </em>,” she teased, kissing the side of her head. </p><p>“You’re impossible,” Agatha muttered, though her voice lacked any real anger. Her hands rested against Rio’s chest as if she were contemplating shoving her again but couldn’t muster the resolve.</p><p>“And yet, you married me,” Rio countered, pressing another soft kiss to Agatha’s forehead. </p><p>Agatha groaned, her head falling forward to rest against Rio’s chest, her cheeks still blazing red, as Rio only felt warmth, “I don’t know what I was thinking.” </p><p>“Clearly, you were thinking I’m hot, infatuating, and irresistible, might I add,” Rio replied, her cheeks hurting from her smile as her hands sliding up to cradle Agatha’s face.</p><p>Her thumbs brushed gently against her wife’s flushed cheeks. Agatha let out a resigned sigh, finally looking up at Rio with a small, reluctant smile. </p><p>“You’re lucky I love you.” </p><p>Rio grinned wider, leaning down to capture her wife’s lips in a tender kiss. </p><p>“I’m the luckiest,” she murmured against Agatha’s lips. </p><p>Agatha’s arms looped around Rio’s neck, pulling her closer for a moment before she pulled back with a stern expression that didn’t quite reach her eyes. </p><p>“Now, go get dressed before I change my mind about doing your makeup.” </p><p>“Yes, ma’am,” Rio replied with a mock salute, earning an amused eye roll from Agatha. </p><p>As Rio turned to leave, she glanced over her shoulder with a sly grin, “By the way, you’re welcome for last night.” </p><p>Agatha grabbed the green dildo and threw it at Rio’s retreating form, her laugh chasing her out of the room.</p><p> </p><hr/><p>
<b>Students </b>
</p><p> </p><p>William slammed his bag down, half wincing as he thought of his MacBook and making a mental note, not to do it again as he rushed to pull it out. It was fine as he gathered the rest of his supplies, more students filling in after him. He wasn’t even supposed to have Biology today, but their professor decided to reschedule the missed class from Friday, same with their literature class, but Harkness only rescheduled one of the days so far. He smiled as Ireland sat next to him in the back, slumping into the seat and putting her head on the cool black surface of the lab table. She groaned, her blonde hair falling down behind her as their two friends, Eva and Ryan, sat in the other seats across from them. </p><p>Eva chuckled, peering at Ireland, “Still sulking after yesterday, Ireland? It’s not like Dr. Vidal is going to remember. She doesn’t care enough.” </p><p>Ireland only groaned, lifting her head up, “No, you don’t get it. I ruined my chances at getting recommendation letters from her. She will take one look at my face and laugh.” </p><p>William shook his head, “Again, Eva is right. She doesn’t care enough to remember. Plus, you could always ask another professor. Like Dr. Harkness.” </p><p>Ireland rolled her eyes, “No, I was going to get Vidal’s. It’s hers that matters. She has a higher position and it would look amazing for my scholarships.” </p><p>Ryan leaned forward, a smirk on his lips, “Are you sure it isn’t because you have a crush on her? Really, Ireland, you ask her if she has a boyfriend? What are we, twelve?”</p><p>“How dare you! I am a happily taken woman.”</p><p>“Sure,” Eva rolled her eyes, taking out her notes. “Like you wouldn’t drop Chad <em> if </em> Vidal ever looked your way.” </p><p>Ireland swatted at her, both of them laughing before the door opened. Their heads turned, staring at the ice professor who glided in, her steps even and measured. She was in her usual black and green, except looking a little more casual. Jeans hugged her legs, the green turtleneck sweater high, and her hair down for once. Ireland’s and Eva’s eyes rolled over her, taking in her dark eyeshadow, her black rimmed glasses perched on her nose, and how her jet-black hair framed her face. She didn’t cast a single glance at them, unpacking her stuff and setting her phone face up on the podium. William and Ryan shared a glance, unsure why Vidal deliberately took out her phone after yelling at them yesterday. </p><p>“I don’t think I have ever seen her with hair down,” Ireland muttered. </p><p>“She always has it in that clip of hers,” Eva confirmed, her head turned over her shoulder.</p><p>“She’s so intimidating,” Ireland whispered, her voice barely audible over the sound of Dr. Vidal arranging her lecture notes. </p><p>“And you’re so obvious,” William muttered, not bothering to hide his smirk. </p><p>Dr. Vidal looked up then, her sharp brown eyes sweeping across the room. The murmurs of conversation ceased entirely. She didn’t need to speak to gain silence; her gaze alone was enough. </p><p>“Good afternoon, class,” she said, her voice smooth yet firm, filling the space effortlessly. “I hope you’ve all had time to review last week’s material, as we’ll be diving straight into today’s lab. Partner assignments remain the same. Instructions are on the board. Any questions before we begin?” </p><p>Her eyes flicked across the room, completely skipping Ireland and her friends. Her gaze was hard before she crossed her arms, shifting under her sweater. Without waiting for any questions, she turned back to the board and began outlining the experiment. </p><p>“See? She doesn’t even remember you,” William whispered to Ireland, nudging her gently. </p><p>“I don’t know whether to be relieved or offended,” Ireland muttered back, glancing at the professor as if waiting for some sign of acknowledgment. </p><p>Ryan leaned over, a mischievous glint in his eye, “Maybe if you ask her about her love life again, she’ll remember you for sure.” </p><p>Ireland glared at him, her face turning red, “I will kill you, Ryan.” </p><p>Eva stifled a laugh, shaking her head, “You two are stupid. Just focus on the lab before she decides to actually notice you– for all the wrong reasons.” </p><p>Dr. Vidal’s voice rang out again, interrupting their hushed banter, “I trust everyone is ready to begin? This is a graded exercise, so I suggest you focus.” </p><p> </p><p>Ireland and William paired up again, Ireland staring into the microscope as she tapped in her pen impatiently. Her eyes were already straining under the light, and the thought of looking at another slide made her want to throw something. William sat beside, scribbling the answers as the class was quiet today, just the sound of hush conversations and heels clicking against the tiles as their professor walked back and forth down the aisle of tables. They both froze as the clicks neared their table and stopped. Both looking up to find their professor’s harsh gaze on their notes, and then looking at the microscope and sighing. </p><p>“You’re looking too closely and making this more difficult than it needs to be,” she said curtly, pulling the machine closer to her. </p><p>They both watched as she adjusted the lens with ease, before peering inside. She was a natural, still caring grace as her left hand lifted, spinning to another lens. William couldn’t help but catch it– her ring finger. There was nothing spectacular about it, while her other hand was adorned with silver rings, this hand was empty, except for the fainted tan line. It wrapped around her left finger as if she was missing a ring… Before William could look more, she pulled away, pushing the microscope back to his partner. </p><p>“This is what you need to be looking at,” she said, before taking William’s paper. “Sloppy, rewrite it if you want me to grade it.” </p><p>They both swallowed hard as Vidal moved to Ryan and Eva, nodding before moving to the next table.</p><p>“Did you see that?” William whispered. </p><p>“See what?” Ireland snapped, turning back to the lab. </p><p>William pulled her closer, “The tan line on her ring finger– her <em> left </em> ring finger.” </p><p>“Dude, I thought you were gay,” she teased. “Why are <em> you </em>looking at her fingers?” </p><p>“I am gay,” he snapped. “But you’re the one wondering if she got a partner.” </p><p>Ireland rolled her eyes, “Yeah, yeah, but there’s no way. Let’s be honest here. Who would want to marry her– scratch that. Who would <em> she </em>tolerate enough to want to marry?”</p><p>William shook his shoulders, turning back and erasing his answers to rewrite them. Class went on, rather uneventful and luckily for them, they kept out of Dr. Vidal’s gaze as she moved around the class, helping other students. Not that Ireland would admit it, but considered her interest peaked. She tried glancing at her professor’s fingers, unable to see the tan line William proclaimed there to be. </p><p>As class came to an end, Dr. Vidal stood in the center of the room, “Okay, make sure both names are on the top. No name equals a zero. And before I forget, there has been a slight change in our schedule. I had to move your quiz a day ahead. Monday, you will take the quiz on chapters seven and eight, instead of Wednesday. Wednesday, there will be no class and because I am your ever generous professor,” she quirked a smile at that before continuing “there is no homework or notes. See you tomorrow.” </p><p>With that, she came around, collecting the papers from the groups. As Ireland handed hers, she tried looking again at Vidal’s finger but it was safely tucked under the stack of papers in her hand. </p><p align="center">
<strong>***</strong>
</p><p>The walk to Poets’ Haven was miserable, the rain falling hard on them as the four of them raced to the next class. They made it, quickly filing into a single line from the narrow hallways and packing into the classroom. They found their seats in the back again, lining up in a row with the desks before Dr. Harkness walked in. </p><p>Eva grimaced, her gaze narrowing over the professor, “I don’t know which witch is worse, the purple or green one.” </p><p>Ryan nodded in agreement, before chuckling “Imagine if they met. I put my money on Vidal.” </p><p>The others rolled their eyes, before Ireland whipped towards them, “They have met. Vidal is her boss.”</p><p>“So I placed my money right,” Ryan smirked before their heads whipped around, another set of heels clicking into the room. </p><p>They stared at the younger professor, her smile a little too bright as she approached the purple witch without caution or fear, “Agatha, here’s the papers from the other day.”</p><p>The students all raised an eyebrow, watching as the purple witch whipped around, her gaze cold, but cracking slightly that might be inclined to something a little more friendlier if you knew her. Dr. Harkness took them, setting them on her podium before looking back up at the professor. Eva stared, her eyes locked on the way Dr. Maximoff’s eyes widened, a blush creeping into her cheeks. </p><p>“Thanks, Dr. Maximoff,” Dr. Harkness replied, her tone even, but not laced with the usual scrutiny. “I will catch you later.”</p><p>The red-head professor seemed to linger a little longer, before turning and waving up at William and stalking out, glancing behind her at Dr. Harkness. </p><p>“She got it just as bad for Dr. Harkness than you do for Dr. Vidal,” Eva teased Ireland. </p><p>Ireland elbowed her slightly, “I think they’re just friends.”</p><p>“No way,” William shook his head. “She was lingering outside Dr. Harkness’ office yesterday, not even realizing she left. I think Dr. Maximoff got a thing for Harkness.” </p><p>Ireland laughed a little louder, “Harkness would bite off her head. She doesn’t have a chance.” </p><p>Ryan laughed with her, “Just as much as you have a chance with Vidal.” </p><p>“Okay, settle down class,” Dr. Harkness’ smooth voice floated over the room, silencing them in seconds. “A few announcements before we begin. Next Wednesday, there is no class.”</p><p>Ryan smirked, muttering to the others, “Oh fuck yeah. No class all day.” </p><p>William only tilted his head. Two of their most strict professors, who played by every rule in the book, cancelling class on the same day? The absences on Thursday and Friday? Not to mention, Vidal had left suddenly right after Harkness announced she cancelled class yesterday. </p><p> </p><p>Something wasn’t adding up. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio rubbed the back of her neck as the sweater itched at her. It wasn’t hers. She stole it from her wife’s side of the closet, having run out of her own turtlenecks and was pleased to find it was black. The bruise had barely faded, and it was already Friday. She put her head in hands, hating that they had agreed to go out tonight with the coven. As much as she loved Alice and Lilia, tonight wasn’t the night for her. She couldn’t wear the sweater out, they would make fun of her, and the makeup had barely covered the mark. There was still a dark undertone. </p><p>Worst of all, they were going to ask questions why neither of them were drinking and that alone, made her blood boil. Agatha’s safety was everything, and she wouldn’t let anything such as raw fish, caffeine, or alcohol harm her– and the smoke, Rio would have steer her around the smokers, especially Alice. Then, there was Jen. Rio was more pissed about her knowing of her marriage than she cared to admit. Jen was fine to work with, great sometimes, but the random snide remarks about Agatha after staff meetings, hell, even their bickering always got under her skin. Agatha could be cruel, sure. That was one of the reasons Rio fell in love with her, but the way Jen painted her made her want to smash her face into the ground. </p><p>She had done it before, a couple times to other people back in her early college days, when she could get away with it. The disgusting men who would hit on her girlfriend when Rio was right there– it always made her see red. There were only two bar fights. Before the third, Agatha had dragged her out of the bar and straight home. But before that, the black eye from the first, and the broken wrist from the second were a hundred percent worth it in her eyes. Agatha… wasn’t too happy, but she easily distracted her girlfriend with her head between her legs. Easy fix… except when her wrist was broken. Though, it didn’t deter Rio as she had practically begged Agatha to sit on her face. But that was too early in their relationship, and her girlfriend had been too shy…. Rio still found herself between Agatha’s legs. </p><p>She chuckled at the memory, before frowning. Her wife had snapped at her this morning. She had to miss lunch with her today due to a meeting, and Agatha had simply snapped. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> “I don’t want to hear it,” Agatha walked out of their room, going into their kitchen.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Rio was quick on her heels, not understanding why her wife was acting like this. Agatha never complained before, in fact she perfectly understood that Rio’s position was a little more demanding. She had received the email this morning, telling her the other deans switched the meeting to today, saying they could meet in one of the student halls and watch the students, seeing how they were outside the classroom.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Mi amor?” Rio asked, confused as her wife simply busied herself making ginger tea.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Agatha threw her hands up, “No. Go. Go eat in the fattening dining hall without your wife.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Rio shook her head, her eyebrows knitting together painfully, “What? My love, you know my job, and it’s just one lunch love. You know if I could skip, I would.”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Agatha didn’t respond, letting the whistle of the tea kettle echo in the silence between them. Rio watched her movements, seeing they were forceful, throwing the spoon in the sink, picking up the kettle a little too roughly, before slamming the lid on her cup, and walking around her. She held back a sigh, wrapping her arms around her wife and pulling her flush against her.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Get off, Rio,” she snapped, making Rio flinch.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> She didn’t back down, instead her hands found themselves under her wife’s shirt, resting on her stomach, feeling the smallest curve of it before kissing the side of her head. Her wife relaxed slightly, leaning into her which Rio took as a win, even though her wife’s posture was still stiff. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “You’re going to make us late,” she finally snapped again, pulling out of her grip and making her way to their front door.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> The drive was quiet, Agatha turning off Rio’s music, which Rio didn’t fight. To her surprise, her wife let her hold her hand the whole trip still until they parked behind Agatha’s building.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Agatha didn’t move, sitting in the seat, her eyes closed as her hand rested on her stomach. Rio’s eyes widened as she watched the tears come from her eyes. She reached over immediately, wiping them carefully with the pads of thumbs before cupping her face in her hands, a move Agatha would usually pull on her.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Hey, hey, mi amor, what’s going on?” Rio asked tenderly.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Agatha shook her head, her voice low and shaky as she responded, “I-I don’t know. It-it just” she swallowed hard “everything feels so overwhelming today. I just wanted a normal day, but it feels like nothing is going right.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Rio’s heart ached at the rawness of her wife’s words. Agatha would never cry about something so small as this, so it confirmed Rio’s suspicions that it was her pregnancy talking. She wiped more of her tears away, shushing her softly. It cut her deeply, seeing her like this. She would burn the whole world if that meant never having to see her wife cry. She kissed her head, trying to calm her wife, as the black of her mascara ran, staining her cheeks.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Love, it’s okay,” Rio whispered softly, moving one hand to rest on Agatha’s stomach. “Don’t try to carry this alone. I am here for you always. You just need to talk to me, tell me what’s going on.”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Agatha took another unsteady breath, her eyes closing as she leaned into Rio’s touch, her hands finding hers and holding them tightly.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I’m just so tired. I don’t feel like I have control over my own body, and I just wanted you to hold me during lunch– it’s stupid, really–” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “It’s not,” Rio quickly interrupted. “You know I would, you know I always want to be holding you, my love. Plus, you’re doing a lot right now–” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Agatha shook her head, “No, I am not.”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Agatha, you are carrying our child. Do you realize how much your body is working? Not only that, you are a wonderful professor with far too many classes this semester. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Agatha kept her eyes closed, but accepted Rio’s words. Rio smiled softly, kissing her forehead, down to her nose, until Agatha met her lips. The kiss lingered a little longer than necessary before they pulled away, Rio quickly wiping the stains of black from her cheeks and placing another kiss to her forehead.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She was worried about her wife all day, especially during lunch which she just got back from. She barely paid attention to the other deans, her mind drifting. </p><p>
<em> What if she snaps at her students? What if she cries in front of them or in front of anyone else?  </em>
</p><p>Rio’s mind was a whirlwind of these questions throughout the day. Even now, she wondered how her wife was faring. She told her previously, the moment her last class was over she would come to her office, and walk together to their car… even if it was risky. Normally, Rio would make it to the car first and wait for her wife. </p><p>The alarm on her phone alerted her and snapped her out of her thoughts. It was time for class, and worse it was the freshmen. Today would be simple though. Her plan was to go over the quiz, make sure they had the basic understanding from the previous two chapters. She was pretty sure she surprised them the first time they did a review. She half wondered if her students thought she would leave them high and dry, but she was a witch, not a monster. </p><p>She grabbed her notes and coffee, making her way through the halls and into the classroom which was already full. They were loud and laughing, the excitement and rush of Friday filling the air. Rio was tempted to roll her eyes, but quickly reminded herself, she was also going off to a bar that night. She was sure these freshmen had a bunch of fake IDs, ready to line up in the cold as they waited to get into the Cauldron, the university pub. The coven was going just outside of town, making their way to The Moon and Suns. This pub was far enough away where there wouldn’t be a student in sight and was a real witch-themed pub. It was the coven’s favorite spot. </p><p>Rio got on the computer, pulled up her slides and flicked off the lights in front of the classroom. Usually, that got their attention, but for some reason, they were a little more energetic today. She raised an eyebrow, leaning back against the board, her eyes scanning over them, until she met one of their gazes. From what she remembered, her last name was McGrath and she was the one who asked about her love life and effectively embarrassed herself.  She stared her down first before her gaze moved to her friend who also looked up at her, silencing. She watched the ripple, students seeming to realize their peers had stopped talking until there was nothing but silence. She waited it out, wanting them to squirm. William was the first, shifting uncomfortably in his seat and it was enough. </p><p>Rio stood up straight, her arms crossed, “Take out your notes. Today, we are reviewing for your quiz. Save all your questions for the end. There, you can ask your questions or you can leave early. Up to you.” </p><p> </p><p>She spoke clearly, listening to furious typing and scratching of paper as she went. She paced herself, hoping to shorten their questioning time, not in the particular mood. She still had to wait, either way, her wife still had one more class after her. Rio paused at one point, waiting for her students as she took a long sip of coffee, pulling at the sweater again. </p><p>A knock at the door had her head and all of the other students’ heads turned as well. She froze, seeing the new office assistant standing there with a bouquet of black roses. The students’ eyes were on them immediately. She swallowed hard, stepping forward and motioning with her hand to step into the classroom. They had already seen. </p><p>“Delivery for Dr. Vidal,” the assistant said proudly. </p><p>Rio bristled, taking the flowers harshly, “Why didn’t you just leave them outside my office?” </p><p>“Awwww,” she heard the chorus behind her. </p><p>She whipped around, shooting daggers at the group of girls who let out the annoying sound before facing the assistant. </p><p>“Don’t interrupt my teaching again, unless it’s an emergency. You may go,” she flicked her hand dismissively. </p><p>The assistant stuttered back, muttering apologies before Rio looked at the roses. They were from her wife to decorate her office with. If anything they were an apology from this morning, which she would have to talk to her about again. There was no point to apologise. She shouldn’t have to feel like she had to apologize for things she couldn’t control. Not being able to help herself, she found the tag, flicking it open to read: </p><p> </p><p>“<em>A</em><em>l </em><em>corazón negro que late por mí ~ 💜 </em>”</p><p> </p><p>She fought a smile, but it won in the end, making her turn her back to the students, trying to feign indifference as she set the bouquet carefully on the table. </p><p>“Who’s it from?” a student piped up, the moment she turned. </p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, crossing her arms again, and stated simply, “None of your business.” </p><p>The class erupted in a mix of snickers and whispers, but Rio’s stern glare silenced them quickly. </p><p>“Settle down. You have a quiz coming up, and I have thoughtfully prepared a review for you. Unless you’d like to stay after class and explain why your curiosity is more important than my time?” </p><p>The students straightened in their seats immediately, the tension in the room shifting back to focus. Rio allowed herself a small smirk, turning back to the notes on the board and continuing her lecture. But as she went, she still felt the warmth from the flowers that her eyes would find as she would speak. Her mind briefly wandered from time to time. Agatha always found the most creative ways to show her love, even if she struggled saying it. And despite her earlier frustrations, Rio felt her resolve soften. Tonight, she’d make sure to hold her wife close and remind her just how much she meant to her. But for now, the students didn’t need to know anything except their upcoming quiz, which she decided to make harder.</p><p> </p>

<b>Rio</b>
</p><p> </p><p>She sighed, stepping into her office, the flowers clutched tightly in her hand. The moment her door shut, she leaned forward, smelling the flowers, taking in the sweet floral and scent of the earth. It calmed her, her heart easing for a moment, knowing her wife was okay and she would see her soon. She did end class earlier, and left after answering a few questions. She had two hours– two hours to fill her time before she could go see her wife. It wasn’t long, but she already felt like the clock hands were purposely dragging, elongating time and twisting a knife into her wandering thoughts. The freshmen had Agatha in thirty minutes and something about how she had already lost her patience today– well, she wouldn’t blame her wife if she snapped at them too. </p><p>Rio set her bag down before unwrapping the green paper around the bouquet. Setting the card on her desk, she slipped the rubberband off the stems, avoiding the thorns as she turned to the large vase on her desk, already standing with red roses from her wife a couple of weeks ago. She had a long day and somehow, her wife knew and sent her flowers. The red petals were slightly curling, their edges tinged with black, announcing the entrance to their next life. She took them out, setting them aside before taking the vase and changing the water. With care, she placed the black ones in before grabbing tape and hanging the red ones upside down against the other table in her office full of stacks of papers– the papers she still needed to organize. </p><p>A sharp knock on the door drew her from her thoughts. Her eyes narrowed as she held the rose up, placing the tap against its stem, “Come in.” </p><p>One of the teenagers from her class came in slowly, his MacBook firmly in hold as he glanced around her office before meeting her eye. She watched as he flinched, quickly avoiding eye contact as he stood stiffly, the only movement from his free hand; a pointer finger picking at the skin of his thumb. He drew his lips in a line as he swallowed hard before speaking softly. </p><p>“Dr. Vidal, I hope I am not disturbing you. I was wondering if I could ask you a couple more questions on bryophytes and the antheridium,” his voice wavered, sweat forming on his brow. </p><p>She quirked an eyebrow, continuing to hang the roses, “Sit, would you like a glass of water, er–”</p><p>“William Kaplan,” he squeaked. “Yes, please.”</p><p>“Mr. Kaplan,” she repeated, hanging the last of the roses before retrieving a cup and filling it up. </p><p>She placed it in front of him, sitting down at her desk, and pulling out her own textbook. As she was flipping through the pages, searching for their chapter, William seemed more at ease, slouching back in the chair. Rio would roll her eyes. She knew that she could be mean, but William seemed like he was going to pass out the moment he stepped into her office. Part of her cringed about the thought. She wondered how many of her students were like this, too scared to visit her during office hours, even though she knew her tone was gentle when they were one on one. Hell, sometimes she had fun with the labs, especially when they would get onto their bird week. </p><p>Bird week was before finals, something to lessen the students’ nerves. She would teach about the different types of birds and how to classify some of them through their beaks and the type of food they ate. They played games, using spoons, tweezers, scissors, and a binding clip– each simulating a different type of bird beak– to pick up some fake beans, corks, and strings– to simulate different food eaten by birds– and to calculate who was fastest at picking up what. </p><p>Rio had her fair share of finals weeks, many spent in tears, sometimes working herself up so much, she was puking at three am after a study session. Her and Agatha had to be away from each other during finals, each of their own frustrations causing them to snap at each other. After finals were over, Rio would stay in her girlfriend’s apartment for however long before heading home. Agatha would stay, her mother… Well, Rio didn’t want to think of that particular woman, especially after she had caught them entangled together when she barged into Agatha’s apartment unannounced. </p><p>“Spanish?” William’s voice broke through her thoughts abruptly the moment she found the chapter. </p><p>She snapped her head up, seeing William leaning forward, staring at the card she left carelessly on her desk. The message was faced up, the purple heart small, but it was enough to make her uneasy. She swiped it away, her hand striking it like a viper and setting it in her drawer before he could pry more. </p><p>“Yes, my first language,” she supplied, maybe hoping it would distract him, but her own nagging curiosity got to her. “Do you speak?” </p><p>He shook his head, “No, I study Latin.” </p><p>She quirked a small smile, “I did too when I went to Harvard. Now, what is troubling you with bryophytes and their antheridium?” </p><p> </p><p>The questions weren’t bad from the teen. She explained it with ease, before eventually, making her way to her whiteboard and drawing out the diagrams. He listened well, his entire focus on what her lecture supplied. For thirty minutes, her mind focused away from her wife, able to relax and push the clock’s hand faster. But in the end, she still had to wait an hour and thirty minutes for her wife. As the minute hand neared, she stopped, turning back to the teenager. </p><p> </p><p>“Any other questions, Mr. Kaplan? Worst is that I can write an excuse for your next class.” </p><p>He simply shook his head, his eyes wide, “Sorry, Dr. Vidal, but I don’t think Dr. Harkness would take kindly, even from the Dean.” </p><p>She couldn’t help but chuckle, already hearing her wife. She would be chewed out the moment she showed up and worse, this kid would get the brunt of it, “Of course, I understand. I will see you Monday.”</p><p> “Thank you, Dr. Vidal,” he offered her a smile before stepping out and closing it behind him. </p><p> </p><p>
<b>Agatha </b>
</p><p> </p><p>The class wasn’t bad, and neither was her mood. It seemed to calm the moment she had more tea in her system and she stepped into her role as a professor, but as class came to a close, she couldn’t shake the weight settling back into her shoulders. She bit her lip, her mind on her wife, the panicked and hurt expression on her face and the way her eyes shined when she snapped at her this morning– it haunted her throughout the day. Though, she hoped she placed a smile on that beautiful face the moment she stepped back into her office after her class. She dropped the roses off with a new assistant, leaving quickly, not wanting to be caught in the science department by any of her students or Kale for that matter. She was going to have to play nice tonight, for Alice at least and for Lilia. Lilia didn’t always tolerate her dramatic flair, would always– always call her out on her bullshit. It was only fair to make the woman her best friend. When she introduced her to her at-the-time-girlfriend, Rio had grown to like the woman, and joined their group, making their coven. </p><p>Alice was already in the picture before she met Rio, in fact, she was pretty sure it was Alice who gave Rio the push to ask her out that one night. Rio had shown up with flowers at her apartment, uncharacteristically rambling nervously and in one breath, asking Agatha on a date. Agatha had froze, taking the flowers but at the time she had no words. Rio had only smiled, telling her to think on it, and left after she pressed her lips softly against Agatha’s cheek. Agatha did think about it. She remembered vividly tossing and turning before sitting up at three am, marching to Vidal’s dorm room, and telling the woman she would like to date her, but not to get her hopes up because Agatha didn’t do feelings. The infuriating woman only smiled, taking her into her room where they talked for the rest of the night until Agatha accidentally fell asleep in Rio’s arms. </p><p>It was a perfect, unofficial first date.</p><p>“Hey, there, Agatha,” a cheery voice echoed from behind her. </p><p>She snapped her head up, watching the redhead ease her way through the exiting students and towards her. She smiled brightly, and Agatha recoiled slightly as her eyes wandered her body up and down. She wasn’t in the mood to entertain this, and worse, her patience was already thinning with the redhead. She couldn’t seem to take a hint no matter how many times she said no to her requests. It was always lunch this, walking together here and there, and she was always popping by with tea now. She was starting to think maybe her wife was right, but Rio was always possessive, always jealous in her own kind of way. She loved her wife for it, in fact it was one of the many reasons she fell in love with the incorrigible woman. Therefore, in moments like these, Agatha wasn’t sure if Wanda was indeed trying to be her friend, or if she had other intentions. She remembered being new, the nervous energy of trying to fit in with the new scene, and she knew Wanda didn’t have any other friends in the department. It wasn’t like she hated the woman, but the more she pushed, the more she was starting to. </p><p>“Oh, hey Wanda,” she said, quickly collecting the papers. </p><p>“You look radiant today,” Wanda smiled at her, taking a step forward. </p><p>Oh. </p><p>
<em> Oh.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Shit.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Rio is going to have a field day with this… and worse, she’s then going to be pissed.  </em>
</p><p>“Um, thanks?” Agatha replied, looking up with a puzzled expression. </p><p>Wanda’s grin grew a little too wide, and Agatha instinctively took a small step back. </p><p>This was new. </p><p>She was never this bold before, and now, Agatha was sure her wife was right. Friends don’t compliment each other, at least not like this. Still, she knew how to handle herself and didn’t want to make a scene.</p><p>“So, I was thinking,” Wanda started, her voice laced with the familiar enthusiasm Agatha had come to recognize. “It’s Friday. You’ve made it through another week of lectures. How about we grab a drink? A little happy hour to wind down?” She leaned forward just slightly, her gaze far too intense for comfort. “You know, you could use a break. We could talk work– or, you know, just... talk.” </p><p>Agatha’s stomach twisted at the offer, and she quickly glanced around the classroom, hoping for a distraction, though it was mostly empty now that most students had filed out. She smiled politely, masking the tension in her shoulders.</p><p>“That’s kind of you, Wanda, but I actually already have plans with some friends I haven’t seen in a while,” she said, shifting the papers in her hands to hide the slight nervousness in her voice. </p><p>Her stomach turned again, but it wasn’t just her nerves– it was the baby too. She fought, placing a hand on her stomach, but the emotions were surging. She felt backed in a corner. Suddenly, the smell of Wanda’s perfume was in her nose, suffocating her. She swallowed hard, everything in her screaming for her wife. She prayed that Rio would somehow know and barge into the room to stop the woman. She <em> needed </em>Rio’s possessiveness, her overprotectiveness in this moment. She felt something pricking at her eyes, making her blink it away. </p><p>“Oh come on, just one drink,” Wanda took a step closer, her smile still sweet. “Before you meet your friends, I will even pay.” </p><p>Before she could think of a response, a voice echoed behind her, “Hey, Dr. Harkness, do you have a second? I have a couple questions about the most recent essay.” </p><p>She whipped around, her eyebrows creasing in confusion. They already finished the essay and went over it. She hadn’t even given the next text to read for their assignment. William only widened his eyes, almost telling her to go along with it.</p><p>“Of course, William,” she said, following him to his seat. </p><p>She watched as he quickly went through his bag, pulling out random papers before she heard the click of the door. She turned, making sure she was gone. It was just her and William, and already, William was packing up his bag.</p><p>“How did you–”</p><p>He shook his shoulders, “Don’t mention it, Dr. Harkness. Dr. Maximoff is not that subtle and, although for a literature professor, she lacks perception.” </p><p>She felt herself relax at that, the corner of her mouth pulling up into a smirk, not able to hide it. He offered the same quiet smile, throwing his bag over his shoulder.</p><p>“Have a nice weekend, Dr. Harkness.”</p><p>With that, William walked out, leaving Agatha alone to wrestle with the storm building inside her. Her breath grew heavier, coming in quick, shallow bursts as she rubbed her stomach in an attempt to calm herself. Her mind raced, focusing only on one person– Rio. Her legs moved on their own, leading her straight to her office. </p><p>When she opened the door, she was met with the sight of Rio sitting on her couch, absorbed in one of her books. Rio didn’t look up right away, but when she finally did, she tossed the book aside without hesitation. Agatha didn’t give her a moment to react. She slammed the door behind her, papers scattering to the floor, but she didn’t care. All that mattered was Rio. </p><p>Without a second thought, she crossed the room and straddled her wife’s lap, wrapping her arms tightly around her. Rio was immediate in her response, pulling Agatha into a protective embrace, her hands moving up and down Agatha’s back in soothing strokes. Agatha buried her face into Rio’s neck, inhaling the familiar scent of pine and something uniquely Rio, as the tension melted from her body, her breath finally slowing in her wife’s comforting arms.</p><p>“Hey, <em> mi amor. Está bien. Estoy aquí. Te tengo. Solo respira </em>,” she whispered softly. </p><p>Rio stroked through her hair, her fingers brushing through the long strands and calming her instantly. She nuzzled closer, falling slightly to the side on the couch, but kept herself firmly in her wife’s hold. She felt something soft press against her forehead repeatedly, another hand on her stomach, rubbing in soothing circles. Rio continued her soft mutterings in Spanish, easing Agatha’s racing heart as they sat there. </p><p>They should have been home by now, getting ready for the bar, but neither of them moved, soaking into each other’s embrace and filling the space with a quiet love. </p><p> </p><p>When Agatha finally pulled away, she noticed the sun was already setting. She didn’t care, because Rio was here. Her wife was here, holding her, protecting her, being everything she needed and more. Her wife didn’t stop the ministrations, keeping the gentle circle on her stomach and the soft brushes through her hair. </p><p>Her voice was quiet, but filled with her concern and protectiveness, “<em> Mi amor, </em>what happened? Talk to me.” </p><p>She took a breath, her hand clutching on Rio’s shirt like a lifeline, “Wanda, she was so persistent. I-I just wanted you, but she wouldn’t take no for an answer– I just wanted you, Rio.” </p><p>Her voice was small, barely heard above a whisper. Part of her couldn’t believe that she was admitting it aloud. Of course, she always wanted Rio, wanted her love, her arms wrapped around her– but never did Agatha vocalize it. It wasn’t in her nature, it wasn’t something she would <em> ever </em>do. In truth, her wife would just know when she needed her. It was an unspoken thing between them. Her wife never pushed, never minded when she would clamp up– and worse talking about her feelings?</p><p>She internally cringed at herself, hearing herself outside her own body. The last time she did something like this was their wedding, during their ceremony– she had taken a blade, carved a hole into her chest, and taken out the beating muscle. It was there, in front of their closest friends, in front of the people they made their family, she offered it to Rio– vowing it was hers and hers alone. </p><p>And to her surprise– realistically, it wasn’t a surprise because it was <em> her </em> Rio– Rio had simply taken the same blade, plunged it into her chest and yanked out her own through the gaping bloody wound, giving it to Agatha without a single thought behind those gorgeous, rich soil eyes. It was Rio’s own way of saying, <em> Here, here is my heart. It’s black and it beats for you. </em></p><p>Agatha wasn’t going to let Rio one-up her in their vows, but she did anyway. At least in her eyes, but Rio, she was sure the woman thought Agatha had won as neither of them could stop themselves from crying, especially Rio. When Agatha had read from the beating muscle, her face at first paled, confusion flickering across before it must have dawned on her that Agatha would forever love Rio unconditionally… because Agatha Harkness?</p><p align="center">She didn’t do feelings…</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">not for anyone…</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">especially, in front of a crowd of people…</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">but she did for Rio. </p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center"><u> Only for Rio Vidal </u>.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hold on her tightened, pulling her closer as her expression softened with a protective fierceness. She kissed the top of Agatha’s head, her voice steady but tinged with a hint of restrained anger. </p><p>“You don’t have to explain. I’m here. I know you didn’t want any of that.” </p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, trying to calm her breathing, trying to stop herself, but she couldn’t. It was pouring out of her, as if someone had taken a sledgehammer to a damn wall, and the water finally burst through the cracks. </p><p>“I– I didn’t know how to get her to leave me alone. She doesn’t seem to understand that I’m– and when she was getting too close, I– I just... I couldn’t breathe. I wanted you there…” </p><p>“Shh,” Rio murmured, her voice low and soothing, “You’re safe now. I’ve got you. I’ll always have you.” </p><p>She continued to rub gentle circles on Agatha’s stomach, and Agatha’s tense body slowly relaxed. Agatha tilted her head to look into Rio’s eyes, the concern etched deeply on her face. </p><p>“I’m sorry, my love. I didn’t want to make you worried–”  </p><p>“You don’t have to apologize for feeling that way,” Rio reassured her, brushing a lock of hair from her face. “You’re mine to protect, Agatha. No one will ever make you feel unsafe again. I’ll make sure of it.” </p><p>The intensity in Rio’s gaze sent a shiver of comfort through Agatha, her heart slowing with every word. She leaned back into Rio’s embrace, feeling a renewed sense of security. </p><p>“I just need you with me. Always.” </p><p>Rio kissed her forehead, her voice full of love and promise, “I’m not going anywhere. You’re everything to me, Agatha. It will always be just <em> us </em>– well, until our little one decides to join.”</p><p>She smiled softly, tilting her head up in silent invitation. Her wife understood without a word, leaning in to press their lips together. </p><p>The world melted away, its chaos and noise fading into nothingness. In that tender moment, it was just the two of them– wrapped in the warmth of their love, lost in the safety of their own universe, a place that felt like home in a way– somewhere Agatha wasn’t sure how to name. All she knew is that Rio still held her beating heart. </p><p>

<b>Alice</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Alice sat back against the booth, looking over the crowd that had gathered. It was a packed night, a crowd larger than she had seen. She and Jen had gotten lucky, snatching a corner booth away from the sweating bodies pressed together that gathered in the center. Laughter rang out, the smell of alcohol invading her senses. Beside her, Jen shifted, moving closer to her, which Alice picked up on immediately. She smiled to herself, bringing her drink up to hide it as Lilia smiled at them from across them. </p><p>They were waiting on the power couple– the couple that Alice had gotten together fifteen years ago. She will happily take that credit. <em> She </em> hounded the botany nerd. <em> She </em> listened to her late night rants. <em> She </em> put up with her attitude and then her self-doubt. <em> She </em> convinced Rio to get her shit together and ask the scary literature major out. It was <em> her </em> idea to get Agatha flowers. And it was <em> her </em>who called Rio a coward, which was the final straw that led her to asking Agatha out. </p><p>Goddess, Rio was so smart that she was fucking stupid. </p><p>She would never forget finally snapping at her, after hearing for the hundredth time: “What if she doesn’t like me like that?” </p><p>She had smacked Rio upside the head, startling them both, but she didn’t care. Because a woman like Agatha Harkness would never look in Rio’s direction without having some sort of attraction or something more. </p><p>She didn’t like Agatha at first. She was rude, callous, and self centered. She didn’t care who she had to step on to get what she wanted, and when Rio and Agatha met, sparks didn’t exactly fly. No, Rio hated Agatha, but Rio being well, Rio, she loved getting under the woman’s skin. It was to the point that their professor put them in a group project for their midterm to get them to stop… whatever they were doing. Then, next thing Alice knew, Rio would disappear for long periods of time. She would cancel their coffee and study sessions, their movie nights, and even their lunches. Alice, at the time, wasn’t going to let that slide, and she quickly found out that Rio and Agatha had grown close. Rio smiled more, was warmer, calmer– Rio Vidal was happy. And then Alice realized that her best friend, whose heart was as black as the sky without the stars, had fallen in love. </p><p>“So, Agatha and Dean Vidal, how the hell did that happen?” her girlfriend asked, glancing at the doors as well. </p><p>Lilia and Alice shared a soft laugh with each other. From what Alice gathered, Lilia had been the one to tell Agatha she was in love. The woman was the only one to call Agatha out, other than Rio who would always get the <em> look. </em>They had worked well together, trying to get the two ice queens to admit they actually had hearts. </p><p>Lilia cleared her throat, “We all go way back. We were freshmen at Harvard, and all of us had to take one of those intro to literature classes, no matter your major. You know, one of those stupid freshmen classes. Agatha and Rio were seated next to each other, and well, the rest is history. College sweethearts, but don’t let their cold, mean demeanor fool you. Their tarot? The Lovers.”</p><p>Jen stared at Lilia for a moment, and Alice was grateful at herself for explaining to Jen before about Lilia’s strange talent for divinity. They all had joked they had something witchy about them, hence; The Coven. </p><p>Alice nodded in agreement, “They’re disgustingly in love with each other.”</p><p>Jen raised an eyebrow, clearly intrigued, “Disgustingly in love? That’s not exactly the vibe I get from either of them.”</p><p>Alice grinned, swirling her drink lazily. </p><p>“Oh, trust me, they’ve perfected the whole intimidating power couple aesthetic. But behind closed doors?” She leaned forward conspiratorially. “Agatha’s a total sap for Rio. I’ve seen her buy plants she had no idea what they were, hell, write poetry for the woman, and learn Spanish for her, Jen. <em> Spanish. </em> And don’t even get me started on Rio. That woman will annihilate anyone who even looks at Agatha the wrong way.”</p><p>Lilia smirked, raising her glass in agreement, “They balance each other out in the weirdest way. Rio softens Agatha’s edges, and Agatha keeps Rio grounded. It’s honestly kind of annoying how well they work, especially since they both can be the most toxic person for anyone else.”</p><p>Jen glanced between them, still skeptical but entertained, “Alright, but why do I get the feeling you two are secretly proud of them?”</p><p>“Because we <em> are, </em>” Alice said, grinning widely. “We built this empire. Lilia and I were the architects of the Great Harkness-Vidal Love Story. Without us, those two would’ve just glared at each other across lecture halls and called it a day.”</p><p>Lilia laughed, “It’s true. Agatha was way too proud to admit she liked anyone, and Rio was too busy overthinking everything but also too proud in her own way. They needed us to shove them together.”</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes but smiled, “So, when do I get to see this ‘disgusting love’ for myself?”</p><p>“Oh, you will, don’t get too excited. They <em> are </em> disgusting,” Lilia said, wincing before chuckling. </p><p>Alice smirked, “Especially, Rio Vidal.” </p><p>“That’s Rio <em> Harkness </em>-Vidal,” a cold voice sounded.</p><p>They all turned, finding Rio and Agatha walking towards them, commanding the room’s attention without even trying. Rio was in her usual leather jacket and boots, outside of her office attire, and her arm slung casually around Agatha’s waist. Agatha, ever poised, was dressed in a dark maroon sweater dress and heeled boots, her sharp eyes narrowing in on them. Alice looked back to Rio, already finding that little spark in her eyes– the one that only ever lit up when she looked at Agatha. </p><p>“Hey, witches, sorry we are late,” Rio greeted as they approached, her voice warm despite the teasing edge.</p><p>Alice and Lilia stood, hugging them both before Lilia allowed them to slide to the back of the booth, them both in between the group of friends.  </p><p>“You two talking about us again?” Rio asked, narrowing her eyes playfully at Alice and Lilia.</p><p>“Always,” Alice shot back. “Can’t help it. Your love life is our greatest achievement.”</p><p>Rio snorted, but Agatha just raised an eyebrow, clearly unimpressed, “You’re both insufferable, you know that?”</p><p>Alice grinned, raising her glass, “And yet, you keep us around.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched, a rare flicker of amusement breaking through, “Fair point.”</p><p>“So,” Lilia leaned towards them as Rio shrugged off her jacket, “why the hell are you late? It wouldn’t have anything to do with that poorly covered mark there, Rio?” </p><p>Rio’s lips twitched, her eyes narrowing, but Alice could still see the tinge of pink creeping into her cheeks, “No, thank you very much. We got held up, some work problems treading too close to home.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha warned. </p><p>Rio shook her head, rolling her shoulders as she wrapped her left arm around Agatha’s shoulders, her amethyst wedding band shining in the bar’s dim lights.</p><p>Alice nudged Jen, “Oh, might I add Rio has a jealous streak–”</p><p>Her friend glared at her, “<em> I do not </em>!”</p><p>She opened her mouth again but Alice beat her to it, “How many bar fights have you started? The evidence is working against you.” </p><p>Agatha smirked, “She has a point, sweetheart.”</p><p>“Bar fights? Now, I have to hear this,” Jen leaned forward, her chin placed on her propped up hands.</p><p>Rio’s wife laughed this time, “Oh, let’s just say two people got a little too close to me, and Rio stepped in.”</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes, trying to hide her amusement and avoid the woman’s dagger-full stare, “Rio basically taunted them until they threw the first punch. One of them was a man about six feet tall, drunk as fuck, but somehow, this little minx–”</p><p>“Minx?” Rio gasped, in mock offence. </p><p>“–escaped with only a broken wrist. The first fight was with a woman, who I am pretty sure Rio punched first, but the cameras told a different story. Rio only had a bloody nose from her.” </p><p>Rio sat back, a smug expression on her face, “Yeah, and I would do it again.” </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but to Alice’s surprise, she leaned into Rio. Her own hand came up to Rio’s, where it rested on her shoulder. She entwined their fingers together, her own emerald wedding band sparkling. </p><p>Jen laughed, loudly, leaning against Alice this time, “And pray tell, how the fuck are you our boss?”</p><p>“She is as slippery as a snake. Never got charged, somehow.”</p><p>They laughed before falling into a comfortable silence, Agatha still impossibly close to her wife. It was strange to Alice. She knew the pair well, but Agatha rarely displayed any affection in public. She was pretty sure it was one of their rules, but here she was, their hands intertwined, Agatha’s body practically molding itself to Rio’s. She had only seen them like this when she barged into their home unannounced, and even then, they would separate. Her eyes lingered on them a little more as her girlfriend laughed at something Lilia had said, Rio joining lightly. Agatha was unusually quiet, her gaze lingering on Rio. Normally, the woman would offer her own smart comment, make a dig at Jen, but that was when it hit Alice something had happened– something was wrong. </p><p>Her eyebrows creased, noting how neither of the pair were drinking. Rio would never pass up her gin tonic and Agatha, her neat whiskey. She eyed them again, seeing the stiffness in Agatha’s body language. Her eyes slightly red, as if she had cried earlier in the day. Alice sat up, realizing she was not going to let this pass. She already heard the absences from both Rio and Agatha last week and during the week, plus, Rio still wouldn’t budge about the whole running to get Jennifer during a lab. Alice admitted she didn’t always get along with Agatha, but if her mother had shown up again, Rio and Agatha shouldn’t be here. They should be at home, both of them taking the time they needed together. </p><p>Alice cut in kindly, “Hey, is everything alright?”</p><p>All of their heads turned, Agatha looking Alice up and down as Rio cocked her head, “Yeah, why?” </p><p>“You two are attached at the hip, and more than usual. What happened today? And don’t bullshit us. It’s practically written on your face.” </p><p>She watched as the pair shared a look before Agatha took a breath, “You guys know the new professor in the literature department?”</p><p>At that, Alice watched as Rio’s jaw clenched, her eyes growing darker. Agatha must have felt the shift in her wife, giving her hand on her shoulder a gentle squeeze, their rings clicking together. </p><p>“Oh yeah, Wanda Maximoff,” Jen nodded. “She seems sweet.” </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, but said nothing. </p><p>“She has been a bit relentless on me. She tried asking me out to the bar tonight, and the woman could not take no for an answer.” </p><p>Jen shook her shoulders, “Well, did you tell her you are taken?” </p><p>Everyone stiffened at that. </p><p>Alice fiddled with her hands, “Um, Jen, because of Rio’s position we all agreed to keep their relationship under wraps. They are really big on privacy, dear, but Agatha, she does have a point. It’s not like you two are announcing your whole status to the university, wearing your rings won’t kill you.”</p><p>Agatha and Rio shared a look, speaking a language they alone understood, but Agatha sighed, “Yeah, maybe we should start wearing our rings, but have you heard these freshmen this year?”</p><p>They all laughed at that, Lilia throwing her head back, “Touché. They spread rumors like wild fires. I can already hear it all the way in the music department. I heard today that Rio has a secret admirer. Something about black roses being delivered to her during class.” </p><p>Rio grumbled at that, “The assistant should have dropped them off at my office.”</p><p>“But Jen has a point, you two. <em> You, </em>” she pointed a finger at Rio, “can’t get all possessive and jealous when someone talks to your wife if neither of you are wearing your rings.” </p><p>“Seriously, guys. You put that there for a reason,” Alice nodded.</p><p>The couple looked at each again, speaking their language again with their eyes. Agatha smiled, tilting her head, making Rio roll her eyes before she smiled as well. Then, she leaned down, placing a soft kiss on the woman’s lips. </p><p>“Disgusting.”</p><p>“Ew.” </p><p>“Gross.”</p><p>They all chorused together.</p><p>Rio sent them the finger as the night slowly turned into laughter and carefree conversation.  </p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b>***</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Alice had finally managed the nerves to intwine her hands with Jen’s underneath the table. Her blood was in her face, she already knew her cheeks were pink, but she quickly blamed it on the alcohol. To be fair, she was a couple drinks deep, the room a tad uneven, and a happy little buzz ran through her. She felt her head rest on Jen’s shoulder as their laughter rushed through her. She turned her gaze to Rio who was calmly talking to her girlfriend, and Jen, at first uncomfortable with being so open with their boss, now relaxed, talking freely with Rio. But Rio, being the workaholic she is, couldn’t help but drift into that territory. She knew it was safer for Rio before opening up to someone. Jen was still new to their coven, but for once, it felt complete. Alice felt complete, her heart mending slowly as Jen’s hand tightened in hers. </p><p>Her mind drifted again, trying to figure out if she was lucky enough to be like Rio. Maybe Jen and her would be the tame version of Agatha and Rio. Alice admired their love, in fact she was sure she was seeing true love. She had never seen a love as bright as theirs. The way they complimented each other, balanced each other, and somehow still loved each other through their faults… especially Rio’s. She knew her best friend was a walking red flag with her jealousy streak. In fact, she was sure that’s how Rio lost previous girlfriends, but Agatha was just as much as a walking red flag, and in some twisted way, seemed to flourish underneath Rio’s possessiveness. </p><p>“Alice,” Lilia hissed, nodding her gaze to Rio. </p><p>Alice turned her head to Rio, finding the woman stopped talking, her gaze hard, piercing across the bar. Her jaw was clenched, her own fingers digging into the table. Alice knew this reaction anywhere and suddenly, the buzz was gone. She turned, searching for Agatha who had gotten up to get them drinks this round. She quickly spotted her, leaning back, away from some tall redhead. Alice watched, seeing Agatha back away slowly as the woman only grew closer, her steps uneven, but her hand was placed on Agatha’s shoulder. </p><p>Alice narrowed her gaze to the woman. She was plastered, barely keeping her body from falling over. Agatha shoved the woman’s hand off of her but the woman didn’t let up, smiling at her like a deranged Cheshire cat. Then, a twinge of recognition shot through her. This was Wanda Maximoff, the new literature professor that had asked Agatha out, and somehow ended up at the same bar off campus. </p><p>“Fuck,” she cursed as she turned back to Rio, who she knew was already seeing nothing but red.</p><p>“<em> Move, </em>” Rio’s voice was unrecognizable.</p><p>It was cold, detached, and it lacked any hint of warmth. It wasn’t something Alice had ever heard, even between the bar fights. This voice was disembodied, something that seemed to drip with an icy lifelessness– something that screamed death. Alice couldn’t stop the way her body shivered and flinched away from her friend. Even Lilia’s face seemed to pale as she stared at Rio. </p><p>“<em> Four of pentacles </em>,” Lilia muttered.</p><p>Alice was going to ignore it, but froze as the next invisible tarot card was read off Rio. </p><p>“<em> Death </em>.” </p><p>She turned to Rio, not allowing Jen to try to move as Lilia already knew to hold her seat, trapping Rio in. </p><p>“Rio, hey! Look at me!” </p><p>Rio did, her eyes flashing with fire, a look that could kill if it were possible, “You can’t do anything. We are too old for this shit–”</p><p>“<em> I don’t care </em> ,” Rio snarled. “You don’t understand what’s at stake. You <em> have </em>to move!”</p><p>They all stared at her, <em> What the hell does that even mean? What’s at stake? </em></p><p>Alice continued to stare at her, not understanding this version of Rio. This wasn’t the normal possessiveness coming off the woman. She looked panicked under her anger, like the longer her wife was dealing with this, the more she seemed to be in danger. No, this wasn’t Jealous Rio, this was something more serious, more loyal– more desperate. </p><p>“Rio, you can’t go over there. They are both your subordinates.” </p><p>Alice stepped in before they received another tongue lashing from her friend. She knew if they kept Rio here longer, she would do something worse than start a bar fight, and Alice wasn’t ready to figure out what that worse was.</p><p>“I will get her, Rio,” Alice said before she could think. </p><p>Rio snapped to her, and Alice swore her grip could break the table in two, “Take her to my car, now. We are done here.” </p><p>Alice took Rio’s keys, shoving them in her pocket before reaching for Agatha’s coat. She felt Rio’s gaze pierce into her, the way Rio’s eyes followed her. It made her shake, as if Alice let something happen to Agatha, then Rio would <em> not </em>hesitate to kill her. She couldn’t wonder why this was different, why it seemed so serious– she had to focus before her best friend came for her head. </p><p>Alice was quick, taking a breath as she slid her arm around Agatha’s waist. She felt the woman stiffen, catching a glance at her. She silently prayed Rio wouldn’t kill her for this. </p><p>“Hey, Aggie–”</p><p><em> Please don’t kill me either for calling you that, </em>she thought to the woman. </p><p>“The group is heading out. Movie night at my place,” she said quickly.</p><p>Agatha relaxed into her arms, losing the tension in her as Alice turned them, putting space between her and the woman. </p><p>“And who are you?” Wanda slurred, her head turning. </p><p>“A friend,” she faked her smile. “You should go home too, before you do something you might regret.”</p><p>Wanda shook her head too fast, “Nonssesnce, I waz just telling Ag-a-tha how pretty she is. Ssss-shame, no one else hass caught her.” </p><p>Alice shook her head, her arms moving behind to drag Agatha around the woman. She felt the coat slip from her arms along with the keys from her hand. Alice stepped with her best friend’s wife, keeping the distance for her as Agatha slipped around her, bolting towards the door. </p><p>“Heyyyy, what’s your problem?” Wanda towered over her, making Alice shrink. </p><p>She swore in her head, hoping she wasn’t about to do what Rio had done too many times for a professor. Then, a hand was on her back, a familiar steady presence. She couldn’t hold her smile as Jen stepped next to her, meeting the literature professor head on. </p><p>“Wanda,” Jen said calmly, gaining the drunk woman’s attention. “Didn’t expect to find you here.”</p><p>Wanda shared a small smile, but her gaze was searching for Agatha, “Yeah, well my friends dragged me out tonight. I can say t-the same. ” </p><p>The professor struggled on her footing, Jen was faster, steadying the woman just as Rio slipped past, basically running out the door. Alice blinked, stepping back as then other women were there, looping their arms around Wanda and dragging her back to their booth. </p><p>“Sorry, about her,” one muttered, giving a scared smile. </p><p>The moment they were gone, Jen looked down towards her, “What the fuck was that? You never told me Rio was <em> that </em> toxic.” </p><p>Alice shook her head, staring at the doors, “No, no, this was different. Trust me, I know my best friend can be a walking red flag, but this…” she trailed off “this was different. Rio would never act like that when it would come to an employee. Something is going on that they’re not telling us.” </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<u> <em> Before The Bar </em> </u>
</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Wanda </b>
</p><p> </p><p>Wanda practically slammed her head onto her kitchen table as her friends laughed at her. She hated this, and worse, she could tell she scared Agatha. She didn’t mean to, but something in her told her maybe putting a little more pressure, more emphasis that was interested would tell the woman that she was serious. Agatha didn’t seem like the type to bullshit with her relationships, she would want something serious. So, Wanda foolishly tried that. </p><p>And oh, did it backfire. </p><p>She felt sick to her stomach, feeling like some creepy old man at a bar who couldn’t understand the word no, but Agatha hadn’t entirely said no. She never directly said no. It was always “sorry, not now” “sorry, I am busy” “sorry, maybe another time.” She was losing hope, and part of her knew she needed to stop, especially now that she realized she made the woman uncomfortable, and worse she crossed a professional line– in front of a student.</p><p>She grimaced, hiding her face as she realized how easy it would be for either William or Agatha to go to the dean– Rio…. Rio fucking Vidal. She was always there, always hovering around Agatha, and part of her couldn’t help but twitch– wondering if Rio was subtly trying to get with Agatha, and casting out any competition. It wasn’t fair. It wasn’t professional on her part either. Rio was their boss. She shouldn’t have a personal relationship with her staff, but a surge of something heavy casted through her again as she thought of the woman– the power she held over her, how easy it would be for the woman to bring more of their superiors in for making another employee uncomfortable. </p><p>For a lack of better words, Wanda Maximoff was fucked. </p><p>“Oh, come on, Wanda,” her friend, Elizabeth, sat next to her. “It can’t be that bad. A little rejection never gets you like this.” </p><p>“Honestly, Wands, you are acting like you are losing everything. This Agatha Harkness can’t be that interesting, especially if she pays you barely any attention,” Kathryn put a hand on her shoulder. </p><p>She looked up, finding Elizabeth nodding her head, “Come on, let’s go out to the bar. Forget work. Forget her, and forget whoever the fuck Rio Vidal is.” </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>So, that’s how Wanda found herself that night, throwing shot after shot back. The vodka burned her throat, but it felt right, better than whatever her thoughts were previously on. She threw back another, drowning out the conversation of her two friends. She was staring out the window, her mind lost on something. She wasn’t sure what as she simply turned, grabbing Kathryn’s shot, and throwing it back. </p><p>“Jesus, Maximoff, lay off will ya!” </p><p>She rolled her eyes. </p><p>Elizabeth sat up straighter, “Wanda, she’s just a woman. Grew a pair. Tell her straight up or just take the rejection. There’s other women and men.” </p><p>“It’s not fair,” she said simply. “I just wanted her. She’s beautiful, composed, intelligent, and she just has something about her that… that makes her glow.”</p><p>Kathryn snorted, “Yeah, and you think she will want you, you drunk Russian?”</p><p>Wanda slammed her hand down, “For the last time, I am not from that country. I am Sokovian.” </p><p>Kathryn only huffed at her, rolling her eyes as Elizabeth sighed, “Please, Wanda, for our sanity and for your dignity, find someone else. Hell, you could have anyone.” </p><p>Wanda wasn’t paying attention to her. A bounce of chocolate curls and a flash of maroon caught her attention. She snapped her head up, watching a woman walk up and sit at the bar, flagging the bartender down. Her friends followed her gaze, and before either could say anything, Wanda was already half-way across the bar. Her steps were staggered, bumping into strangers and tables alike. She would definitely feel this in the morning, but she didn’t care. She would do it now. </p><p align="center">Fuck Elizabeth. </p><p align="center">Fuck Kathryn. </p><p align="center">Fuck Rio Vidal. </p><p align="center">*</p><p align="center">(<em> I mean who wouldn’t want to ?... oop– who said that !?)  </em></p><p align="center">
<em> * </em>
</p><p align="center">Wanda was going in for the kill…</p><p align="center"> </p><p align="center">
<b>***</b>
</p><p> </p><p>The headache was splintering, hammering into her skull like lobotomy needles. She groaned, her body half hanging off the couch. Everything hurt, her ribs, her hips, her legs, her arm– as if she had thrown herself through a hurricane. She blinked a few times, trying to catch her bearings. It wasn’t her house which meant she was crashing at Elizabeth’s place. She didn’t bother sitting up, closing her eyes as her hand massaged her temples, trying to remember last night. </p><p>It hit her like she jumped off Mont Blanc… without a parachute… rocks in her backpack… and dynamite strapped to her chest. </p><p>Wanda sat up at that, her eyes wide as she remembered Agatha’s panicked expression, the way she kept stepping back, and then some woman was there, dragging Agatha behind her. Then, Agatha had disappeared and Wanda was dragged back to her seat, being fed water from her friends. But that was nothing– it was just the jump without the parachute… no, the rocks in her backpack and the dynamite strapped to her chest was the sight when she looked back out the window. </p><p> </p><p>And there, in the parking lot was Dean Rio Vidal. She was talking to the woman who dragged Agatha off, but she looked up, like she could sense Wanda’s gaze. And when their eyes met, Wanda Maximoff hit the ground. The dynamite went off and she was crushed underneath the rubble of rocks and trees… left lifeless… her body mangled..  the tips of her fingers blackened with guilt and regret… and the last thing she saw was the ultimate rancor and venom in the eyes of Death herself.</p><p> </p>

<p>Rio stared out into the backyard. Her eyes watching the branches lay bare and naked, their leaves dusting the ground as the pines stood firm and strong. The green was beautiful, showcasing their raw power and understanding of the cold. She loved the fall. She loved watching the squirrels find the last of their nuts, the hummingbirds picking at the last of the flowers, and most of all the owls. She wasn’t sure why, but the owls always seemed to love her yard. They were always surrounding her house, something almost like that one scene in the first Harry Potter movie. </p><p>She cradled her hot cup of tea in her hands, warming her as she adjusted the blanket. It was mid afternoon, the sun was high, the days were cold, almost too cold for fall. Her wife was fast asleep in their bed, where Rio had led her the moment they got home from the bar. They didn’t speak of what happened, no, Rio didn’t want to break the moment. The moment they had both showered, Agatha crawled straight into her arms, burying her face into her neck, and refusing to let go. It was eleven in the morning when she woke up herself, but it was a struggle to get out of her wife’s grip. She would have stayed if her bladder gave her the choice. Yet, for a moment she couldn’t will herself to go back to bed. She had work to do, but worse was the impending conversation. She wasn’t mad, not at Agatha, but something gnawed at her that couldn’t be entirely mad at Wanda. Her friends were right. Neither had worn their rings while at work, who was she to get mad if someone flirted with either of them. </p><p>Rio looked down at the giant amethyst on her finger. It was a symbol of Agatha, to be always carrying Agatha’s love with her. She remembered it vividly as if it was yesterday. They both were working for their PhD when Rio was leaning against the door, watching her girlfriend work and for some reason, in that scene, with the lamp light making Agatha’s hair shine, she had muttered, what she thought was underneath her breath, “Goddess, I want to marry you.” Agatha had heard her, and it was there, on that spot, even without rings, Agatha had said “yes.” Seriously, her girlfriend had simply turned around, looked her dead in the eye and said “yes.” Weeks later, they went to a jeweler and customized their rings, agreeing to always carry a piece of each other. It wasn’t what Rio planned. She had some ideas how she wanted to propose to her, but in her moment of awe of the woman before her, she had let her thoughts slip. </p><p>But it was perfect, it was everything, it was so utterly and undeniably them. </p><p>Rio smiled softly, the memory lingering like a quiet whisper. Agatha’s unexpected “yes” had still caught her by surprise, but in the best way. There had been no elaborate plan, no fireworks or grand gestures. Just the two of them, surrounded by the soft glow of a lamp, and the unspoken connection that had always existed between them. It was a simple, pure moment– the kind that made everything feel right. </p><p>Rio sipped her tea, savoring the warmth as it slid down her throat, a small comfort as the coldness of fall settled around her. Her mind wandered back to the night before– the bar, the tension in the air, and the way Agatha had clung to her as if she were the only thing holding her together. It made Rio’s heart ache in the best way, knowing how deeply their connection ran. Yet, there had been something unsettling in the air too, something lingering like a shadow that had followed them home. </p><p>She glanced at the door back into her home, wondering if she was still asleep, tucked under the covers and cradling her stomach. Rio couldn’t help but wonder if Agatha had been processing the same thing. Would they talk about it later? She wasn’t sure if she was ready. Not yet. But she wasn’t angry, not really. She knew Wanda’s flirtation was harmless, even if it stung… okay, yes it made her pissed. The real issue was the silent, unspoken tension between them– the stuff that hadn’t been said but was felt by both. </p><p>Rio leaned back against the cushion of the outdoor swing, her fingers tracing the hot surface of her mug. She rubbed the amethyst ring on her finger again, a small, quiet smile tugging at her lips. Agatha had simply said “yes,” with no hesitation. No doubt. And that was all Rio had ever wanted– her, always. </p><p>Her thoughts were interrupted by a loud yell, “Rio Harkness-Vidal!” </p><p>Rio jumped, nearly spilling the tea as she scrambled to get the blanket she had wrapped tightly around her off. She cursed, standing up, allowing it to fall to the wood of their back porch and setting the mug on the table before running inside. She slid the glass door open, closing it behind her, searching for her wife. Her heart was pounding wildly, looking around the room before making her way into the living room to find it empty. Confused, worry filling her, she turned, thinking her wife must still be in bed, until a body slammed into hers. She sucked in a breath of surprise, before relaxing. Rio smiled softly as Agatha settled against her, still half-asleep and wrapped in the warmth of their embrace. Her fingers instinctively brushed over Agatha’s stomach, the faintest bump just beginning to show, and the touch felt like both a promise and a new chapter in their lives. She pressed a gentle kiss to Agatha’s forehead, savoring the quiet intimacy of the moment. But the softness of it melted away as she felt something wet against the crook of her neck. She gasped, pulling her wife closer, not understanding the tears. </p><p>“Agatha? What’s wrong?” </p><p>Agatha sniffled, though her voice was already gaining its usual sharpness. </p><p>“I thought you disappeared,” she muttered, her tone shifting to one of irritation. “Woke up and you weren’t there. Where the hell did you go?” </p><p>Rio froze for a moment, then let out a soft breath, “I was just outside on the swing, my love. I didn’t want to disturb you while you were sleeping.” </p><p>Agatha looked up at her, eyes red but already hardened by a mixture of confusion and frustration, “You could’ve said something. I don’t like being left alone like that.” </p><p>Rio felt a wave of tenderness mixed with a little amusement knowing exactly what was going on. She knew the mood swings would be rough, especially with Agatha Harkness, but she didn’t expect the whiplash of anger, crying, and then irritation the moment her wife woke up.</p><p>“You were asleep. I didn’t think you’d even notice.”</p><p>“I noticed,” Agatha muttered, rubbing her eyes and brushing away the last of the tears. “I didn’t like it.” </p><p>Rio smirked softly, “I’m right here now. You’re not alone.” She tightened her arms around Agatha. “Not going anywhere.”</p><p>Agatha grumbled under her breath, but a small, quiet acceptance seemed to settle within her. </p><p>“Whatever. Just don’t disappear again,” she huffed. </p><p>Rio leaned down and kissed the top of Agatha’s head, feeling the weight of her wife’s emotions without needing the words. </p><p>“I won’t,” she whispered, “Promise.” </p><p>Agatha huffed again but didn’t pull away. Instead, her wife burrowed into the crook of her neck, refusing to let go. Rio couldn’t stop the smile on her face. </p><p>
<em> This is going to be a long pregnancy.  </em>
</p><p>But Rio wouldn’t have it any other way. </p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b>***</b>
</p><p> </p><p>They didn’t talk right away about the night before, it was too soon, and with Agatha’s mood swings, Rio wasn’t ready to risk it until her wife said something. She had eventually convinced her to sit on the couch with her, holding her close as her wife promptly fell back asleep against her chest. Rio didn’t try to move this time, knowing her wife needed this. The whole past week was weighing on her and the mornings she spent with her head over the sink and Rio holding her hair back, only contributed to her exhaustion. Neither of them wanted to think about what would come Monday, but Rio couldn’t stop. </p><p> </p><p>Later her wife was beside her, working on grading essays as Rio reviewed HR… human resources. As Dean and witness of the situation last night, she had to report it. It wasn’t <em> just </em>because Agatha was her wife, it was because it was a clear violation of the university’s policies. Sure, it was in public, but at the end of the day they were all coworkers and Wanda clearly passed professional and personal boundaries. Her wife was shaken after the incident and worse, she heard later that a student stepped between Maximoff and her wife at one point. She felt her jaw clench, staring at the list of names she could contact. This wasn’t personal. If any of her workers had something like this happen, she would contact HR, but something made her pause. What if she was overreacting? What if she was being an overprotective wife? What if she made this personal? </p><p>And it was for this reason, Rio and Agatha had agreed to make their relationship secret. Not this reason exactly, no. Neither of them ever thought someone would dare flirt with them to a certain level of extent. Rio and Agatha both acknowledged they weren’t the easiest people to work with, and it would obviously lead to some people in their departments disliking them. They then agreed that if that were the case, then neither would be affected by the other. Moreover, no one would think Dr. Agatha Harkness-Vidal was getting special treatment by Dean Rio Harkness-Vidal. So, it was just Dr. Harkness and Dean Vidal, two people who rarely crossed paths at work. Their superiors knew, and they ne ver had an issue, but it would be clear the moment they asked for maternity leave, that they wouldn’t hide their marriage anymore. In truth, Rio never felt like she was hiding. No one asked, that wasn’t a student, so she never said anything. </p><p>She glanced at her wife, watching her push the glasses up on her face before scribbling something on a student’s paper and flipping to the next. She knew Agatha knew that they needed to talk about it. It wasn’t just a home ordeal… no, their professional lives now had fully mixed in with their personal– and it was something they had feared for a long time coming. Before Rio could open her mouth to ask to talk about it, both of their phones went off. </p><p>They snapped their heads to the coffee table, Rio taking her phone and Agatha leaning against her as they opened the message:</p><hr/><p align="center">
<u> <b>The Coven</b> </u>
</p><p> </p><p><b>Alice: </b>What the hell was last night? </p><p> </p><p><b>Lilia: </b>Seriously, Rio. Enough with the radio silence. You don’t get THAT possessive of your wife. So spill. </p><hr/><p>Rio groaned, handing the phone to Agatha with a resigned sigh. Agatha took it without a word, but Rio couldn’t help but bury her hands in her face, feeling the weight of everything crash down on her. She had completely forgotten about how she’d reacted last night. All she could remember now was the overwhelming urge to go over and confront Wanda. The anger was still there, bubbling beneath the surface. </p><p>In that moment, all Rio had wanted was to pull Agatha away from the situation, to protect her from the stress and the chaos that Wanda had caused. Her thoughts had spiraled, consumed by the worst-case scenarios. What if the stress was too much for Agatha? What if it hurt the baby? What if they lost the baby– and worse, what if she lost Agatha too? Rio knew her wife better than anyone. She could read every subtle shift in her posture, every little sign of discomfort. Even with Agatha’s back turned to her, Rio could feel the weight of her exhaustion and anxiety. Agatha was overwhelmed, and Rio could see it in the way she carried herself. It tore her apart knowing not being the one to pull her away, to immediately hold her in her arms. </p><p>Her wife handed her back the phone, going back to grading like nothing happened. She raised an eyebrow at her before looking over the texts: </p><hr/><p align="center">
<u> <b>The Coven</b> </u>
</p><p> </p><p align="right">Wednesday afternoon ~ Agatha<b> :Me</b></p><p> </p><p><b>Alice: </b>Tf does that mean Harkness ?</p><p> </p><p><b>Lilia: </b>Great explanation thx</p><p><b>Lilia: </b>And why do you have Rio’s phone ?</p><p> </p><p><b>Alice: </b>Not one.

Now stop bothering me on my day off <b>:Me</b></p><p> </p><p><b>Alice: </b>We all have the day off too, ya know ?</p><p> </p><hr/><p>Rio let out a long breath, leaning back against the couch as her hands fell to her lap. Wednesday. Of course, it had to be Wednesday. The day of Agatha’s first ultrasound. She glanced at her wife, who was now fully immersed in grading, her glasses slipping down her nose again. Agatha looked calm, as though none of the chaos from the messages– or the night before– was even a blip on her radar. But Rio knew better. Agatha had a way of compartmentalizing, of focusing on the task at hand while burying her emotions until they boiled over.</p><p>She went to open her mouth, knowing it was now or too late, but before she could ask, her wife beat her to it, “You want to talk about last night, don’t you?” </p><p>Rio nodded, watching as her wife slowly put down the pen, sitting her papers on the glass table in front of them. She sat back, her hand on her stomach as she pulled her legs underneath her. </p><p>“Before we do, can I ask you one thing?” </p><p>She nodded her head slowly, finding her wife’s posture stoic. </p><p>“Can you make me ginger tea?” she asked softly. “I like the way you do it with the honey.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t stop the smile, leaning over and placing a soft kiss on her wife’s cheek. Agatha only smiled, but kept her eyes closed as Rio stood, preparing her tea. She quickly returned outside, grabbing her own which was now cold. Remaking hers and the tea that her wife requested, Rio carefully carried them back, setting them on the coasters and settling down next to her wife. </p><p>Rio sat up, her elbow propped up against the back of the couch as her wife turned to meet her gaze. She read it carefully, taking in the way her blue eyes shined at her. There was nothing but a quiet hesitancy, and acceptance for this conversation. </p><p><em> Please, let her mood swings be on my side, </em>Rio prayed to whatever deity would listen. </p><p>“Before we talk work, my love, are you alright? I know we didn’t talk much after what happened, but I saw the way you reacted.”</p><p>Agatha put her head down, refusing to meet her eyes, her hand moving over her stomach as silence filled the room. Rio waited, patiently. She knew never to try to rush the answers out of her wife, especially emotions. The silence wasn’t unbearable, but the more it dragged on, the more Rio began to worry. </p><p>“I am okay, my love, just worried about work. I didn’t realize how much this would mix with both our professional and personal lives,” her wife said slowly, still refusing to meet her gaze, but when she did, there was nothing but worry. “I was more worried about you, though. I was ready for the third bar fight.”</p><p>They both chuckled at that, Rio shaking her head, “Oh, trust me if the others didn’t hold me back there would have been one.” </p><p>Agatha’s soft laugh warmed the room, but her eyes carried the weight of her concern. She reached out, her fingers brushing against Rio’s hand. </p><p>“I know, sweetheart. That’s why I kept my back to you. I could feel how tense you were– like a spring ready to snap.” </p><p>Rio sighed, leaning into her wife’s touch, “I couldn’t help it. Seeing her corner you like that… It brought out something primal in me. You don’t need that stress, Agatha. Not with the baby, not with everything else.” </p><p>Agatha’s hand stilled over Rio’s. Her lips pressed into a thin line, and for a moment, she said nothing. </p><p>Then, quietly, she admitted, “I can handle it, Rio. I’ve handled worse. But I won’t pretend it didn’t shake me a little. It wasn’t just her words– it was the way she acted, like she didn’t care about boundaries or consequences.” </p><p>Rio’s jaw tightened, her fingers curling into a fist on her lap, “And that’s exactly why I need to report it.” </p><p>Agatha blinked, clearly caught off guard, “You’re going to HR?” </p><p>“I have to,” Rio said firmly, sitting up straighter. “This isn’t just personal, Agatha. It crossed a professional line. If I don’t report it, it looks like I’m ignoring misconduct because it involves you. I won’t let anyone think we’re bending the rules for our relationship.” </p><p>Agatha studied her wife, her expression unreadable, “You’ve already decided, haven’t you?” </p><p>“I have,” Rio admitted. “But I wanted to talk to you about it first. I know it’ll complicate things for you, and I hate that. But this is the right thing to do.” </p><p>Agatha’s gaze softened, and she nodded slowly, “You’re right. It’s just… I don’t want this to overshadow everything else. We’ve worked so hard to keep our professional and personal lives separate.” </p><p>Rio reached out, cupping Agatha’s cheek, “We have. And we’ll keep doing that. This doesn’t change who we are, <em> cariño </em>. It just sets a boundary. Maximoff needs to understand that her actions have consequences.” </p><p>Agatha leaned into Rio’s hand, closing her eyes briefly. </p><p>“Alright,” she said quietly. “I trust you, my love. But promise me you’ll be careful how you approach this. I don’t want it to blow up more than it already has.” </p><p>Rio smiled gently, pressing a kiss to Agatha’s forehead, “I promise. You’re my priority, <em> cariño </em>. Now, drink your tea before it gets cold.” </p><p>Her wife smiled faintly, taking her cup as Rio grabbed her laptop, opening it to her emails. With ease from years of experience, she wrote to the head of HR: </p><p> </p><hr/><p align="center"><em> Subject </em> : <u> <strong>Reporting Professional Misconduct </strong> </u></p><p> </p><p>Dear Dr. Stark, </p><p> </p><p>I am writing to formally report a matter involving Dr. Wanda Maximoff that has escalated beyond personal boundaries and is impacting the professional environment. While this issue began inside of work with small occurrences, it had fully escalated on Friday, prompting me to bring it to your attention. There are two key incidents I believe you should be aware of: </p><p> </p><ol>
<li><b>Student Intervention on Campus</b><em>:</em> After a lecture, Dr. Maximoff approached Dr. Agatha Harkness, my wife, in a way that made her visibly uncomfortable. Although it was after a lecture, there were still students present. One of which, who saw the interaction, felt compelled to intervene on Dr. Harkness’ behalf. This incident disrupted the professional atmosphere and crossed lines for both professors and student involved. </li>
</ol><p> </p><ol start="2">
<li><b>Incident at a Bar</b>: Outside of work hours, Dr. Maximoff confronted Dr. Harkness in a public setting, setting hands on her and making unwanted advances while under the influence. Her behavior, despite the intoxication, was not only inappropriate but also deeply distressing for Dr. Harkness. I also want to report that I was a key witness to this event, but decided to not intervene due to my position.</li>
</ol><p> </p><p>As Dean of Faculty, I take the responsibility of maintaining a safe and respectful work environment. As a wife, I take the responsibility of putting my wife’s safety and comfortability first, therefore; I recognize that I must take a step back and it would be inappropriate for me to address the situation myself. Thus, I am requesting that HR take the lead as well as give me council on the next steps. </p><p> </p><p>Please let me know how you would like to proceed as well if you need further details or a formal discussion. Thank you for your time and attention. </p><p> </p><p>Sincerely, </p><p> </p><p>

</p><p>Rio quickly added her full last name to her signature, needing it to be clear she was serious about this, and also, to make it more imperative. Agatha took Rio’s computer, reading it over before handing it back to her, leaning into her embrace.</p><p>“‘Decided not to intervene’ my ass,” she muttered. </p><p>Rio chuckled softly at her wife’s comment, gently kissing the top of Agatha’s head as she held the laptop back in her lap. </p><p>“Not the time for sarcasm, my love,” Rio teased, though her chest felt heavy with the unknown creeping in. </p><p>Agatha glanced up at her, her gaze glinting with faint amusement, “I know. But you know I’ll always have your back, even when you’re too professional to admit you wanted to strangle her.”</p><p>Rio’s eye widened as she turned her head slightly, “Oh, I wanted–”</p><p>Lips against hers silenced her, and she couldn’t help but lean into it, cupping her wife’s face after placing the computer to the side. Agatha moved, straddling her hips before a soft weight was placed into her lap. Rio smiled into it, her hands moving up and down her wife’s soft curves. She felt the smirk into her lips before her wife leaned closer, her lips lightly brushing Rio’s ear. </p><p>“<em> I know </em> , my love. You would have loved nothing more than to drag her out of that bar and <em> handle </em> it yourself.”</p><p>Rio shivered at the soft teasing tone in Agatha’s voice, her grip tightening around her waist as she pulled her even closer, their bodies pressing together. She tried shaking her head, not wanting to admit it as her wife’s fingers played with the baby hairs at the back of her neck. Agatha traced her collarbones with her free hand, smirking again before leaning forward. Her lips trailed up Rio’s neck making her sigh, her eyes closing as her lips moved further, avoiding her lips and kissing along her jaw to her ear.  </p><p>“Don’t pretend on me, Rio,” she whispered. “I know you. You fantasized it, dragging her out by her hair, before making her regret it.” </p><p>Rio’s breath caught as Agatha’s lips grazed her ear again, the teasing heat in her voice sending a shiver down her spine. Her wife’s fingers moved with a deliberate slowness, trailing down her neck and along the line of her t-shirt, just enough to hint at something more. </p><p>“You really should admit it,” Agatha murmured, her lips brushing Rio’s ear. “How much you wanted to put her in her place. How much you wanted her to know I’m yours.” </p><p>Rio’s grip on Agatha’s waist tightened, her head falling back against the couch as a low groan escaped her. </p><p>“Agatha…” she warned, though her voice was more pleading than commanding. </p><p>Agatha smirked, leaning closer, her breath hot against Rio’s skin as she placed a lingering kiss just below her jaw. </p><p>“What’s wrong, my love?” she whispered, her hand slipping beneath Rio’s shirt to rest on her bare stomach. “You don’t like me telling the truth?” </p><p>Rio’s hands slid up her wife’s thighs, her thumbs brushing over the soft fabric of her joggers. She knew exactly what her wife was doing, and she wasn’t about to let her have the upperhand. Rio knew her wife just as well as she knew her. She felt her eyebrow raise, her hands reaching behind her wife, squeezing her ass roughly. Goddess, Rio loved her ass. She felt her own smirk creep up as she let out a low laugh, her hands now roaming under Agatha’s waistband, feeling the soft skin before pulling out, her hands back on her hips. </p><p>“Oh, I love you telling the truth, but I didn’t just fantasize about it, <em> mi amor </em>,” her voice dropped an octave, the heat between them building. “But I have to admit, it was a damn close call.” </p><p>Her wife paused, her lips hovering above Rio’s, her eyes dark with something more than just affection. Rio watched as her blues were almost swallowed by black as her hands explored her body, one hand running up Agatha’s torso, before moving back down and slipping underneath her own t-shirt. In truth it was Rio’s <em> Fleetwood Mac </em>concert tee, which her wife stole on multiple occasions, and was the first shirt Rio lost to her when they were dating. Part of her couldn’t believe it survived this long. </p><p>Their eyes never left as heat coiled in Rio’s lower stomach, her mouth practically watering at the sight above her. She would never tire of it. The woman, in all of her usual carefully crafted walls, completely crumbled into need for her, <em>only</em> <em>for her. </em>The moment the final stone fell, Rio knew she had her. </p><p><em> Oh, this is going to be so much fun second trimester, </em>her eyes glimmered at the thought. </p><p>Rio’s heart pounded in her chest as she imagined it. Her wife– visibly pregnant, wanting her, molding for her. As much as Rio adored the play for power, she loved when her wife was nothing <em> but </em> for her. She didn’t know how it would be possible for her wife to become any more radiant than this, but something told her that as her stomach grew, so would her radiance. </p><p>Before she could act, the stones came back up, her wife sliding off of her, the pinks in her cheeks gone as she sat down beside her like they weren’t just about to fuck on the couch. Rio felt her frustration bubble over as she growled, trying to pull her wife back on her lap. Agatha only cocked her head, a sinister smiling playing at her lips as she leaned forward. </p><p>“Send the email, Dean Vidal. Can’t have you acting all unprofessional, sleeping with a coworker and all that.” </p><p>Rio curled her lip at that, rolling her eyes as she grabbed her laptop, sending the email without another thought and setting it on the table in front of them. Then, Agatha’s gasp was music to Rio’s ears as she moved swiftly, her legs bracketing Agatha’s hips and sitting her full weight into her lap. She pinned her firmly against the cushions, her hands resting on her shoulders. The glint in Rio’s eyes was dangerous, a heady mix of frustration and desire that sent a shiver down Agatha’s spine.</p><p>“Oh, is that how you want to play it?” her voice was low and dripping with playful menace. </p><p>She leaned closer, watching the sparkle in her wife’s eyes as hands landed on her hips, fingers playing with her own hem of her sweatpants. She saw the defiance and desire circle in those blues as she lifted her chin, but a smirk still played on her lips. </p><p>“I just thought it would be best for the Dean of Faculty to maintain her decorum,” she teased, her tone laced with mock innocence.</p><p>Rio chuckled darkly, her free hand trailing down Agatha’s side, her touch light and teasing. </p><p>“Decorum?” she repeated, her lips brushing against her wife’s jaw. “You think that’s what I’m concerned about right now?” </p><p>Agatha shivered under the touch, her breathing quickening, but Rio watched her regain it, her smirk growing into <em> that </em>smirk she knew all too well. It was the one that told Rio she lost. She froze for a second, realizing what she had done. Her smile faltered as Agatha’s only grew. She played right into her wife’s trap. This was her plan all along.</p><p>She felt her body twitch, betraying her as it leaned into her wife’s touch. Hands were firm on her hips before one moved, pulling at the hem of pants before moving underneath.</p><p>“I think,” Agatha said, her voice dropping into a deep breath. “We both know what you’re concerned about right now– what you <em> want, </em>right now, don’t we?”</p><p>Rio couldn’t move, unable to breathe by the fire that engulfed her and she was hypnotized by the one who held the torch. Her wife’s smirk was devastating, a smirk perfected to kill, and Rio was her prey. A jolt of electricity ran through her as the hand moved below her navel, tracing the abs there and down. She steadied herself, her hands gripping tighter on her shoulders as her wife hummed, sucking in her bottom lip. </p><p>This woman was going to be the death of her. </p><p>Agatha leaned closer, teasing her ear with her teeth, causing her breath to hitch, “I want to make you forget all about work, all about that woman… forget everything except me.” </p><p>She was so dead. </p><p>With that, fingers moved underneath her boxers, slipping through her folds. She moaned, but quieted herself as her lips crashed against Agatha’s in a kiss that was anything but gentle. She tangled her fingers through her wife’s long locks, threading through the thick chestnut curls. Their glasses clicked together, causing a small laugh from both of them as Rio took them both off, throwing to the side of the couch, latching her lips back to her wife’s. She hummed into the kiss before groaning, something hot and wet prodding at her lips. She didn’t hesitate, opening her mouth for her wife’s tongue as her hips lifted into Agatha’s touch. Agatha refused to acknowledge it, her fingers swirling, touching her in every place but where she wanted the most. </p><p>Her wife moved as Rio bit at her lip, trying to hold on to whatever dignity she had left. They hadn’t done something like this out of their bedroom– that was a total fucking lie, but normally Agatha was the one on top, riding her. Lips were hot on her neck, trailing around her as the arm slipped off her waist, pulling up on her shirt. Rio reached down, pulling herself free from it and throwing it behind her. She gasped when a hot mouth connected to the side of her breast, licking after dark marks were sucked into her skin. She didn’t care, a hand moving from her grip on her shoulder and tangling in the smaller hairs at the base of Agatha’s neck. She moved her hips again, trying to get her fingers inside her or on her clit; she didn’t care, but her wife ignored her still, reaching up to lick the fading bruise of yellow and green on her neck. </p><p>“Agatha,” she gritted her teeth. “No marks.” </p><p>Her wife simply hummed, moving her kisses back down to her breasts. She shuddered, her whole body arching into her touch as a hot tongue probed at her nipple through the green lace. Agatha pulled her bra down, her mouth wrapping around her. She gasped louder, holding her head there as her hips desperately sought more friction. She was growing impatient, every nerve on fire, waiting for the pleasure of water to douse them, but it never came. She could practically hear how wet she was, but her wife only teased her further, her teeth scraping at a pebbled nipple. </p><p>“You should put your piercings back in, you’re so much more fun to tease when you have them in.” </p><p>Rio glared at her, “You know why I took them out.”</p><p>Months ago, Agatha’s hair had tangled in her piercing for the last time. She remembered being jolted awake from the pain when her wife moved in her sleep. It wasn’t the first time, but it was certainly the last as she swore her hair almost ripped off her nipple. </p><p>Her wife shrugged, “I’ll braid my hair back.”</p><p>Agatha leaned down again, capturing her nipple back in her mouth, releasing another gasp from her. </p><p>“No, you–” fingers plunged into her with no warning “fuck! Agatha!”</p><p>Rio felt her hips move in their own accordance, thrusting on her wife as they filled her. She squeezed around them, her head foggy as her neck was bared. She moaned, her wife moving with her thrusts, scraping against her walls before they curled, hitting that one spot that made her moans echo off the walls of the house. Her wife hummed her content, pulling away from her breast and harsh fingers found her chin. She was tugged down, forced to look into those bewitching blues as she panted. </p><p>“You feel so good, baby. You’re all nice and wet, squeezing around my fingers,” Agatha cooed at her. </p><p>Rio felt her eyes widen, her movements picking up.</p><p>“Are you going to come so soon, sweetheart? Just from the sound of my voice?” </p><p>She clamped her mouth shut, gritting out, “Fuck off.” </p><p>Agatha laughed at her, shifting slightly and angling her wrist where her palm rubbed against her clit. Rio moaned louder, a current coiling in her lower belly. Her wife smirked, so Rio did the only thing she could do. She leaned forward, latching her lips in a fierce kiss, all tongue and teeth clashing as they both moaned. It was too much for Rio, the feeling of her wife inside her, the taste of her in her mouth, their tongues dancing a waltz, her nipple still free from her bra, dripping in saliva. </p><p>Rio felt the current spread through her body, warmth taking hold as euphoria clouded her vision. She cursed as she came quickly, her wife riding her through it. Her forehead fell to rest against her shoulder as she came down, but Agatha wasn’t stopping. She gasped again, another finger stretching her, her wife guiding her faster. She buried her face into her neck, moaning and gasping before sitting up straight. She wouldn’t let her wife fully take control. She moved her hips, riding her wife’s fingers as the blue once more held her in place. </p><p>“Such a good girl.” </p><p><em> That’s my line, </em>Rio thought bitterly, but then her mind was back to mush as fingers curled again, her wife forcing her to ride faster. </p><p>Her body was shaking, each deep thrust met with the perfect curl inside her. The liquid sound of fucking harmonized with her moans and pants as a single line of sweat dripped down the side of her face. The pleasure was building, the current now more raw, visceral. It took up every part of her body. She moaned louder, closing her eyes but her wife slowed down, beckoning her to open them. </p><p>Rio forgot about the world. Nothing else mattered, but the woman under her. Nothing was better than this, her wife’s fingers knuckle deep, her palm against her swollen clit– her wife fucking her senseless on <em> their </em> couch, in <em> their </em> home, and with <em> her </em>love. </p><p>Rio came again, filling herself squeeze tighter, but her thrusting never stopped. Sweat was covering her, her moans louder as her wife guided her. It was too much, incredibly too much but her third orgasm was already building. She was desperate, rapid Spanish falling from her lips that didn’t even make sense. </p><p>“Awe, you’re doing so well. Can you take one more?” </p><p>She nodded her head frantically, staring deep into her wife’s eyes. </p><p>“Let me hear you.” </p><p>Rio creased her eyebrows. This was payback from Monday, and especially teasing her about the whining all weak. </p><p>“<em> ¡Mierda! Sí!” </em></p><p>Agatha smirked at her, their lips meeting angrily. Rio swallowed her whines, not caring whose spit was going with it. Everything was perfect. She couldn’t stop even if she wanted to as her stomach clenched, and she tightened on her wife’s fingers that curled and pumped into her. The thrusts were fast, furious, hitting everything and more inside Rio. The knot in her stomach curled tighter, threatening to explode at any moment. She shook over her wife, barely able to keep up with her thrusts that didn’t waver. Her head fell to her shoulder again, her nails digging into her arms as she swore. She knew what was coming as her hand found the back of the couch, trying to direct some of the unrelenting pleasure there. </p><p>“<em>¡Mierda!</em> <em>¡Mierda! Mi amor, </em>if you don’t slow down–”</p><p>Agatha chuckled at her, “Don’t slow, you’ll what?” </p><p>Rio went to pull away, knowing neither really wanted to clean up the mess but her wife simply wrapped her arm around her waist, urging her faster. She tried holding on, she really did, but white flashed through her vision, her body crumbling and falling into her wife. She cried out into her shoulder, muffling the sound as her body spasmed and stilled. She panted heavily, feeling as her wife slowly removed her hand. She shivered, feeling the soaked hand hold against her waist, keeping her up as the other moved with soothing circles on her back, lips pressing against the side of her head. </p><p>Rio didn’t move. Her body was nothing but weight as her mind blanked. She barely registered the sweet nothings from her wife she held her. She took in the scent of lavender and something only that could be described as Agatha, allowing the familiarity of it to steady her breathing. Her hands released their death hold on the couch, allowing her to lazily hold onto her wife as her knees quivered. </p><p>When the strength finally came back to her, Rio sat up, smirking down at her wife who raised her eyebrows as if to say, <em> Really? Three orgasms and you squirting in your pants didn’t take it all out of you? </em></p><p>Rio leaned down, placing a kiss on her lips, “Shower with me?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, removing her hands and standing with her. Rio ignored the way her pants stuck to her, placing another kiss on her wife’s lips before playfully licking her cheek, “I’ll grab the strap, just promise not to throw it at me, okay?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha would definitely throw it at her for that, but Rio didn’t care, because some deity listened to her and her wife’s mood swings were definitely on her side.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<b>Wanda</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda sat back in her office, swallowing hard. The message glared at her, mocking her and replaying the memories of the weekend. She bit her lip hard as she couldn’t pull away. She had hoped the warning would have been an email, not this. Anything but this. Wanda would have done anything else– sit in front HR for hours, even the head of HR: Dr. Tony Stark, trainings, hell even sit in front of Agatha and apologize profusely– anything but this:</span>

<em>

</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Dear Dr. Maximoff, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>I am writing to formally schedule a meeting with you to address recent reports regarding professional misconduct. This meeting is </span>
<b>mandatory </b>
<span>and will take place </span>
<b>today </b>
<span>at </span>
<b>12:00pm </b>
<span>in my office with an HR assistant. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>This meeting is due to an incident reported on and off-campus where the misconduct took place involving a colleague. Please be prepared to address your actions and understand that this conversation will remain professional, but formal documentation has been made and may be made further in lieu of the discussion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Your cooperation is appreciated. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<strong>Rio Vidal, PhD (she/her)</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Dean of Faculty </strong>
</p><p>
<strong>Chairperson, Department of Biological Sciences </strong>
</p><p>
<u>
<strong>Westview University</strong>
</u>
</p><hr/><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Fuck. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was so utterly fucked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda sat back, the only real memory she had was the eyes from the woman, full of all the venom and rancor possible before she turned away walking into the darkness. She blinked a few times, rubbing her temples as her mind raced. It wasn’t supposed to go this far, and part of her hated her friends for not stopping her sooner. She blinked again, her cheeks flushing as she remembered placing her hand on Agatha’s shoulder and her pushing her hand off. She froze hearing the ‘no’ echo in her head and completely ignoring it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda stood, needing to get out of there. She couldn’t face either of them today, and Dean Vidal especially. Worst, was that the dean was there, the fucking dean was at the bar. Wanda felt her fists clench as she realized she must have seen everything, but nothing burned hotter than jealousy and betrayal she felt. Agatha didn’t seem to have a friend in any of the departments, yet somehow it was Vidal? It didn’t even make sense. They </span>
<em>
<span>had </span>
</em>
<span>to have a clash. Their personalities couldn’t possibly have gotten along. And worst, how could Agatha pick that scary fucking bitch over her? </span>
</p><p>
<span>She took a deep breath, running her hand through her hair. Agatha didn’t owe her anything, if anything Wanda needed to be on her knees apologizing, and she could do that right now. If Agatha and Vidal were friends, then she would just apologize, Agatha would forgive her or at least get Vidal not to do any more documentation. It was a drunken mistake. Mistakes happen. Agatha </span>
<em>
<span>had </span>
</em>
<span>to understand that, and then they could start over. Wanda could just be friends, and also get an insight on this Vidal woman. She smirked at that, her nerves settling as she thought of it. It had to be a cross something in the policies for Vidal to go out with her subordinates, right? Bosses don’t go out for informal gatherings like that. It would be too easy to undermine her position. She wasn’t the only one who made a mistake. She couldn’t have been. Vidal was right there with her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Upon stepping out of her office, she froze hearing the voices from the office lounge down the hall. There was light laughter, moving towards her, but Wanda recognized it. She stepped back, closing the door but pressing against it to listen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Relax, Rio,” Agatha said, her voice calmer than she had ever heard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a sweet note to it, something affectionate where Wanda wasn’t sure she could place or wanted to admit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We will figure it out Wednesday afternoon. I am sure the Coven will be excited, but I am sure Alice is going to throttle you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A different sound echoed in the hall. It was oddly warm, and it sent a chill to her bones. The person couldn’t be– there was no way that sound came from </span>
<em>
<span>her. </span>
</em>
<span>Wanda felt her jaw drop, listening to the warmth and relaxation in </span>
<em>
<span>her </span>
</em>
<span>voice, her eyes widening. It had to be fake, honeyed. There was no way </span>
<em>
<span>that </span>
</em>
<span>woman could be so… alive, warm, breathing– Vidal was mean, cold, her eyes dead. This had to be an imposter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh yes, I assume the moment she gets out of her lectures she is going to break the door down,” she hummed her own laughter. “You realize she is going to be as overprotective as me, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled lightly as keys jiggled into the lock, “I highly doubt that, knowing you, Dr. Vidal.” </span>
</p><p><span>There was a pause and a light laugh from Agatha, “Oh, I think we both know you’ll be overprotective mom.”</span><span><br/></span> <span>Rio scoffed, “Yeah, right, and I thought I told you, my</span> <span>little one will call me </span><em><span>mami.</span></em><span>”</span></p><p>
<span>The door opened and shut at that, leaving Wanda shocked. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Overprotective mom… mami? ‘my little one’, </span>
</em>
<span>the thoughts ran in circles as it dawned on her. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio is pregnant?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b>***</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Agatha </b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Your</span>
</em>
<span> little one?” Agatha teased, chuckling softly as she set her things down on her desk. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife smirked, folding her arms with confidence, “How much do you want to bet they’re going to look just like me?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes as she shrugged off her coat, sighing, “Did you forget I’m the one who’s pregnant?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you forget they have both of our DNA?” Rio shot back, stepping closer. “And science doesn’t lie. Brown eyes trump blue. Dominant genes, my love.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her arms circled Agatha’s waist, her smirk playful. Agatha felt a familiar warmth stir at her wife’s touch, but she didn’t let it show, keeping her scowl firmly in place. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, great. Like I need two sets of those brown eyes staring at me, plotting together when you both want something.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The image immediately popped into her mind– Rio with one of her ridiculous schemes, and beside her, their child, wearing the same big brown puppy-dog eyes and a perfectly coordinated pout. Agatha could already feel her resolve crumbling under the imagined onslaught.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It won’t be fair,” she added, shaking her head. “I carry them for nine months, and if they come out looking like you? Where’s the justice in that?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smirk deepened as one hand slid to rest lightly on Agatha’s stomach. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, maybe our second can look like you,” she murmured, her tone softening. “Blue eyes, gorgeous hair, sharp wit– but for now, our son will be perfect.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyebrows shot up. “Our </span>
<em>
<span>second</span>
</em>
<span>? We haven’t even had our first, and you’re already talking of a second? Need I remind you who is going to be carrying that second child?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio only smirked as her reply. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“ And now you’re sure I’m carrying a boy? What are you, the pregnancy whisperer?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged, grinning, “Not exactly, but your hair is shinier. And don’t pretend I don’t notice these things.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re obsessed with my hair,” Agatha accused, though her lips twitched into a half-smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Completely,” Rio admitted, her hand rubbing gentle circles over Agatha’s stomach. “So you should trust me when I say I’m right. It’s a boy, and he’s going to have all my charm and my eyes.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head, pulling Rio closer by the collar of her shirt, “I can’t wait to wipe that smug grin off your face when I give birth to a girl with my blue eyes and my hair.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, leaning in to brush their lips together. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, really? Want to make it interesting?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, “A wager?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Two wagers,” Rio corrected. “If it’s a boy, I get my trip to Yellowstone with you. If they have my features, you’re on diaper duty for a week straight.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned dramatically, rolling her eyes, “Fine. If it’s a girl, you’re taking me to England: Oxford and Cambridge. And if they have my features, I get to pick the Yule tree for the next three years.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s jaw dropped, her expression incredulous, “You’re joking. Agatha, picking the Yule tree is </span>
<em>
<span>my</span>
</em>
<span> thing.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked, tapping a finger against Rio’s chest, “So? Do we have a deal, or are you backing out because you’re scared you’ll lose?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes narrowed, Agatha practically watching her wife’s competitive streak coming to life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, we have a deal,” she said, her voice low with determination. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” Agatha said, smirking as if she already won. “Because </span>
<em>
<span>I’m</span>
</em>
<span> going to win.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand came up, her fingers combing through her hair, “An </span>
<em>
<span>I </span>
</em>
<span>am going to be the one that wipes that smirk off your face, just as I did this weekend when I fucked–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Agatha warned, trying to keep the heat out of her cheeks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife tilted her head, her smirk softening into something more tender, and Agatha’s resolve crumbled instantly. Those big brown eyes– warm, teasing, and full of love– held her captive. With a sigh of surrender, she leaned up, pressing her lips to Rio’s. Rio’s hands slid back to Agatha’s waist, steady but insistent, guiding her until the edge of the desk pressed against her thighs. As she sat, their lips moved in perfect harmony, a hum of contentment escaping her when one of Rio’s hands trailed upward, squeezing her breast lightly. Agatha’s own hand found its way to Rio’s hip, sliding over black nylon and gripping with purpose. She felt the heat of her wife’s body even through the fabric, grounding her in the moment. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They broke apart briefly, and Agatha found herself staring into those mesmerizing eyes again. They were everything– comfort, fire, love. She didn’t let herself linger for long, though, leaning forward with more urgency this time. Her lips captured Rio’s again, her tongue brushing against her wife’s in a plea that was immediately answered. Their tongues danced, the kiss deepening as Agatha drank her in, the taste of her, the feel of her, the electric heat that spread through her entire body. She tugged Rio closer, arms sliding up to loop around her neck, pulling her in as though proximity alone could satisfy the yearning she felt. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A loud knock shattered the moment, and both women sprang apart like guilty teenagers caught in the act. Rio’s eyes widened as she quickly stepped back, straightening her shirt with swift, practiced movements. Agatha stood as tall as she could manage, trying to calm the fiery blush on her cheeks even though every nerve in her body screamed to pull her wife back into her arms. Sliding into her chair, she adjusted her papers and cleared her throat, regaining her composure. Rio, with a perfectly casual air, dropped into the chair across from her, fixing her coat as though nothing had happened. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come in,” Agatha called out, her voice calm and professional despite the storm raging inside her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The door opened, and to Agatha’s mixed relief and irritation, Mrs. Hart stepped into the room, her smile as cheerful and oblivious as ever. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dr. Harkness, Dean Vidal– I thought I’d find you here,” Mrs. Hart chirped. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mrs. Hart,” Agatha greeted, keeping her expression neutral, though she caught the scowl that flashed across her wife’s face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s Sharon, sweetie, or Mrs. Davis now– you know, ever since my husband passed– ” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could continue, Rio shot to her feet, clapping her hands together with forced enthusiasm. The sharp faux-smile on her face nearly sent Agatha into a fit of laughter, and she had to lower her head to hide her grin. She could feel Rio’s glare even as she turned back to Mrs. Hart. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mrs. Davis,” Rio interrupted smoothly, her tone polite but firm, “let’s head to my office. There’s so much we need to cover before the meeting.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood as well, a polite smile gracing her lips as whatever-her-name-was gave a little wave and exited the office with Rio following close behind. Just before stepping out, Rio turned back, her hand brushing over Agatha’s desk as if it were a casual gesture. But her eyes locked on Agatha’s, her lips quirking into a mischievous smile. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lunch, </span>
<em>
<span>Mami</span>
</em>
<span> Vidal?” Agatha teased in a hushed whisper, unable to resist. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s true smile broke through, her eyes sparkling in that way that always made Agatha’s chest tighten with warmth. Without hesitation, she leaned down, brushing her lips softly against Agatha’s in a fleeting but sweet kiss. Agatha couldn’t stop herself from reaching up, her hand cupping Rio’s cheek as she savored the moment, her heart thrumming. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Twelve-thirty, Mama Harkness. My office,” Rio whispered, her grin widening as she straightened. She began to step away but, as if on impulse, swung back around and stole another kiss– brief, playful, and completely intoxicating. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Te veo, mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>,” she murmured, her voice low and affectionate before finally slipping out of the room, leaving Agatha feeling warm and slightly dazed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b>***</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Rio </b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio fell into step beside Mrs. Davis, her long strides slowing to match the older woman's. Mrs. Davis’ gaze drifted over the school gardens as they walked, her expression peaceful. Rio followed her line of sight, noting the azaleas still holding their own against the cold. The vibrant blooms caught her attention for a moment, but Mrs. Davis’ soft voice drew her focus back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How is your wife, Dean Vidal?” Mrs. Davis asked, her tone gentle. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head slightly, considering her answer. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s better, though still upset about what happened this weekend.” She paused before adding carefully, “If I may ask, why did Dr. Stark give me the go-ahead to conduct this meeting? Are you sure it’s appropriate?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Mrs. Davis’ smile widened, the corners of her eyes crinkling.. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know how Tony and I feel about your work, Dean Vidal. You’re an exceptional professor, and you have a knack for maintaining order. Tony trusts that you’re more than capable of handling something like this.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded slowly but couldn’t hide the flicker of doubt in her expression. Her fingers absentmindedly toyed with the large amethyst on her ring finger– a habit Agatha often teased her about. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It wouldn’t be a problem,” Rio replied, her tone even. “But this matter involves my wife, Mrs. Davis. As I mentioned in my email, I would’ve preferred someone without a personal connection to handle it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Mrs. Davis’ smile didn’t falter, but her expression softened with understanding. She stopped walking, turning to fully face Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s exactly why we trust you. You’re fair, Dean Vidal. You’ll see the situation for what it is and do what’s right, even if it’s difficult.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed quietly, looking away to the azaleas again, “It’s not about what’s right, Mrs. Davis. It’s about ensuring impartiality and avoiding complications.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Mrs. Davis chuckled lightly, placing a reassuring hand on Rio’s arm, “Sometimes, impartiality isn’t what’s needed. Sometimes, it’s someone who cares.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned back to Mrs. Davis, meeting her gaze. The sincerity in her words stirred something in her, but it didn’t entirely ease the tension in her shoulders. She offered a polite nod before they continued walking toward the science building. She couldn’t trust herself to bring into words how much she did, in fact, want to rip that woman’s head off. In some other life, Rio imagined she was a killer– a killer for Agatha Harkness. If it were possible…and legal, she knew she would do anything for her wife. </span>
</p><p>
<span>If her wife said to walk, she would run. If she said jump, she would dive. If Agatha said to put a gun to someone’s head, she would shove it into their mouths and pull the trigger without a second thought. If someone laid a hand on Agatha– Rio shook out of her thoughts, knowing this was the exact reason why she wasn’t sure she could handle it. She would never admit aloud, but she was temperamental when it came to protecting her wife, and the thought of what her own voice sounded like that night– the way her best friend even flinched from her– still pranced through her memory. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When they made it to her office, the woman smiled at her flowers, a hand brushing over the black petals before sitting down. Rio gathered her stuff, pulling out the report and passing it over to the HR woman before starting her computer. She couldn’t stop the calm smile, staring at her back screen. It was her and her wife in Salem, when they spent a weekend at a small cottage in the woods together. She had taken a picture of them cuddling in a hammock, Agatha peacefully asleep against her chest with a smile etched into her features. Agatha, at first, didn’t want to go, but Rio, like always, convinced her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>At that moment, Rio saw it. A little boy curled against them on top of Rio’s chest, his brown eyes just as soft, and his hair thick, but ultimately Agatha’s hair color: golden chestnut when the sun hit it just right. She could picture him running around the backyard, Rio lifting him and swinging around as her wife watched from the porch, a bright smile on her face, before their boy convinced her wife to come out and join them in making a large leaf pile. At night, she wondered if he would have Agatha’s hunger for knowledge, maybe they could sit outside, and Rio would tell them about the stars, like she told Agatha on their dates long ago. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She smiled, something flickering through her mind. They hadn’t had a true night in a couple weeks, and Rio was determined to change that. Wednesday night, after kicking her friends out of their house, she would take Agatha to see the stars again: just like their first </span>
<em>
<span>official </span>
</em>
<span>date over fifteen years ago. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Just as she took a sip of her tea, Mrs. Davis spoke, “So, when are you and your wife going to have children?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s composure cracked at the unexpected question, her hand tightening around her mug as she hastily set it down. She coughed, tea catching in her throat as her mind scrambled for an appropriate response. The flush creeping up her neck had nothing to do with the heat of her drink. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Excuse me?” Rio managed, her voice slightly hoarse as she reached for a tissue to dab at her lips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Mrs. Davis tilted her head, her knowing smile only deepening. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Children, Dean Vidal. You and your wife. When are the two of you planning on having little ones? You know, someone to inherit that fiery determination of yours or her wit?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, forcing herself to maintain a professional facade. Her fingers began to toy with the amethyst ring on her finger as her eyes darted between the woman’s eyes, wondering if she somehow infiltrated her thoughts. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s… a very personal question, Mrs. Davis,” Rio said carefully, her tone neutral but polite. “And I’d rather not speculate on such matters during office hours.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Mrs. Davis chuckled softly, clearly undeterred, “Oh, come now, Rio– may I call you Rio? You’re a professor, but you’re also human. Surely, the thought of children has crossed your mind?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The image of Agatha’s slightly curved belly flashed in Rio’s mind unbidden, and her heart ached with the effort it took to keep her expression steady. It drifted to their wagers they place and how already she caught her wife looking for baby stuff online. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They would only tell their close friends, and perhaps Rio’s sisters: Maria and Oriana. Maria… Rio liked less than Oriana. They were the beloved twins, each of their names derived from the sun. Their mother wanted to name them Infinito and Eternity, but </span>
<em>
<span>papi </span>
</em>
<span>shut that down– from the stories she heard about her parents. She flinched at the idea of telling them and worse, her </span>
<em>
<span>abuelita, </span>
</em>
<span>who would insist Rio and Agatha go straight to Puerto Rico so she could perform the birth– apparently having delivered Rio and her sisters. </span>
</p><p>
<span>So no, Rio was not actually keen on sharing the news, even if every fiber of her being wanted to fly into the sky and celebrate like fucking Elphaba on her broom with a ridiculously long cape. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re taking things one step at a time,” Rio finally said, her voice steady but firm. “Agatha and I are both dedicated to our work. It’s a balancing act, and right now, our focus is on each other and our careers.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Mrs. Davis studied her for a moment, her smile softening, “You two make such a lovely couple. When the time comes, I’m sure you’ll be wonderful parents. You have so much love to give.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed hard, her fingers tightening briefly around the edge of her desk. The words struck deeper than she cared to admit, evoking memories of Agatha’s hand resting over her stomach, of their whispered conversations late at night about the life they were creating together. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She forced a smile, nodding politely, “Thank you, Mrs. Davis. That means a great deal.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Mrs. Davis returned to the papers Rio had handed her, leaving Rio to gather her thoughts. Her gaze drifted to her computer screen, to the photo of her and Agatha in Salem. Her thumb brushed over the edge of her ring as her mind wandered, back to the vision of a little boy that would wrap Agatha and Rio around his little finger. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>

<b>Wanda </b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda hesitated outside the door to Dean Vidal’s office, her hand hovering over the handle. Her heart was pounding, not just from the looming confrontation, but from what she had overheard in the hallway earlier. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>We both know you’ll be the overprotective mom</span>
</em>
<span>… Agatha’s voice echoed, the warmth and tenderness unmistakeable.  </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>…my little one will call me mami, </span>
</em>
<span>the unfamiliar tenderness was delivered back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio Vidal was pregnant. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The words had been spinning in Wanda’s mind ever since. It didn’t make sense– Vidal didn’t seem like the maternal type. She was cold, sharp, and unapproachable. And yet, the way she had spoken to Agatha in the hallway had been so… sweet. Affectionate, even. It was jarring, like seeing a completely different person. And Agatha– what the hell was that about? Wanda’s stomach twisted with jealousy. Agatha had been calm, even warm, in her response. The two of them had sounded so close, their laughter echoing softly down the hall. It didn’t fit. It didn’t make any sense for women like them, and it wasn’t fair.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>My little one…</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda shook her head, trying to push the thought away. It didn’t matter. What mattered was salvaging her job and her reputation. Vidal being pregnant had nothing to do with her. She stared at the door, wondering if Vidal’s reaction would be because of her hormones, and how bad it would be… would it even be fair? It was clear now that Agatha and Vidal were friends, best friends dare she say. Best friends were protective, but this? What she saw the previous night and the way the look in the woman’s eyes gave her nightmares… were best friends really that protective? It had to be a mix of the pregnancy and perhaps, because the woman herself seemed to have an emotional range the size of teaspoon… and that was being nice. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She took a deep breath and opened the door. The moment she stepped into the office, she felt the air shift. It was cold, biting at her skin and she felt each individual bump rise on her arms. Everything in her screamed at her turn back, simply go home. She could pretend she was sick, but it was too late. She had sealed her fate. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal sat behind her desk, the epitome of power and control. Her dark eyes locked on Wanda the second she entered, and Wanda had to resist the urge to shrink under her gaze. She almost froze, but felt the quietest bit of relief seeing an older woman sitting across from Vidal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wouldn’t be left alone to the jaws of death. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dr. Maximoff,” Vidal’s voice was low and clipped, a warning in itself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda forced herself to step forward, her eyes darting around the room. The office was immaculate, every detail carefully curated. As she expected it was dark, minus the green couch to the side and a violet blanket draped over the back. Plants littered the room as well, vines from the ceiling, a bonsai tree sitting pristine on a dark mahogany cadenza. Behind Vidal on her cabinets hung dried roses and beside her computer monitor was a green glass vase holding a fresh bouquet of black roses– a gift from someone, perhaps whoever Vidal’s lover was. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, her gaze to Vidal’s hands, where they rested on the desk, and her heart skipped a beat. The ring on her left hand was immaculate– an amethyst-cut heart that caught the light, flanked by smaller emeralds and what looked like diamonds. It was stunning, intricate, and undoubtedly a wedding ring. So, scratch that– whoever Vidal’s husband was gave her the black roses to match the darkness spilling from her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sit.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal’s sharp command snapped Wanda out of her thoughts. She sat down quickly, her cheeks flushing as she realized she had been staring. The tension in the room was unbearable as Vidal’s piercing gaze pinned her to the chair. Wanda fidgeted, glancing again at the ring, and then quickly looking away. She couldn’t stop the questions flooding her mind, but now was not the time to ask.</span>
</p><p>
<span> The room was suffocating and the silence that stretched was beyond uncomfortable. Vidal seemed to let the silence stretch until she fidgeted and it was then, she met Vidal’s dark eyes, sharp as a katana, with an intensity that made her feel like she was in a FBI’s interrogation room where Vidal was the bad cop, and the woman next to her, would let her partner go without stepping in. She had faced tough situations before, but this… this was different. She felt small, just by the mere presence of the woman as she couldn’t breathe. Her gaze flicked to Mrs. Davis, but her calm demeanor did nothing to soften the dark, oppressive weight of the Dean’s presence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal finally spoke, her voice low and seething, “Dr. Maximoff, do you have </span>
<em>
<span>any</span>
</em>
<span> idea how close you are to losing your position here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda opened her mouth, but no words came out. She swallowed hard, trying to form a response, but the Dean didn’t give her the chance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t think you do,” Vidal snapped, her tone cutting like ice. “Because if you did, you wouldn’t be sitting there looking like you just tripped and fell into this situation. This–”  she gestured sharply between them, “–isn't some </span>
<em>
<span>accident</span>
</em>
<span>. This is the direct result of </span>
<em>
<span>your</span>
</em>
<span> actions.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda shifted, her hands clenched tightly in her lap and her eyes blinking rapidly “I didn’t mean to–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stop,” Vidal’s voice rose, cold fury radiating from every word. “Do not insult my intelligence by pretending you didn’t mean to do what you did. You </span>
<em>
<span>meant</span>
</em>
<span> to corner her after that lecture. You </span>
<em>
<span>meant</span>
</em>
<span> to ignore her discomfort. You </span>
<em>
<span>meant</span>
</em>
<span> to approach her in that bar, and you </span>
<em>
<span>sure as hell</span>
</em>
<span> meant to put your hands on her when she made it clear she didn’t want your attention.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda flinched at the venom in Vidal’s words. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was drunk. I wasn’t thinking clearly,” she tried weakly, her voice barely above a whisper. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal stood abruptly, slamming her hands on the desk so hard that the vase started to tip. She caught it, settling as she ran her hand back through her hair as she darkly. Wanda recoiled, her heart racing. The laugh from her was rancorous and somehow that laugh made the room temperature drop. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>You </span>
</em>
<span>are an adult, not some college student with too much to drink! And not thinking clearly?” Vidal repeated, her voice sharp and mocking. “Is that what you’re going to tell me? That you weren’t thinking clearly when you decided to harass someone you work with? When you embarrassed them in front of students? When you humiliated them in a public space? Is that what you’re going with, Dr. Maximoff? Because let me tell you right now, it’s a </span>
<em>
<span>pathetic</span>
</em>
<span> excuse.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Mrs. Davis stirred, her expression cautious, but she didn’t step in. Vidal continued, her voice rising further.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t belong in this profession if you think it’s acceptable to treat your colleagues like that. You don’t belong in this university if you can’t respect basic boundaries. And if it were up to me, you wouldn’t be sitting in that chair right now and I would make sure you couldn’t even get a job within this state!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda felt the blood drain from her face. She opened her mouth to defend herself, but the woman’s glare stopped her cold.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t. Speak.” Rio’s words were clipped, her tone a warning. “You don’t get to explain yourself to me. You don’t get to justify what you did. Because there </span>
<em>
<span>is</span>
</em>
<span> no justification for your behavior.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She leaned forward, her voice dropping to a dangerous whisper, “If you so much as </span>
<em>
<span>look</span>
</em>
<span> at her the wrong way again, you’ll wish this meeting was the worst thing that ever happened to you. Do you understand me?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda nodded frantically, her voice caught in her throat. Mrs. Davis rose, her hand coming up to stop the Dean.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dean Vidal, I think that’s enough for now. Let me take it from here.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal didn’t move, her eyes locked on Wanda, her breathing slow but heavy with restrained anger. Finally, she stepped back, her jaw tight as she turned her attention to Mrs. Davis. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine,” Vidal said tersely, her voice still simmering with rage. “But don’t let her mistake your kindness for leniency, Mrs. Davis. If it were my decision, this wouldn’t even be a discussion.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Mrs. Davis nodded, gently guiding Wanda to stand, “Dr. Maximoff, let’s go over the next steps outside.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda stumbled to her feet, her legs weak and shaky as she followed Mrs. Davis out of the office. She didn’t dare look back at Vidal, but the searing intensity of her words echoed in her mind, leaving her shaken to her core.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<b>Students</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>William and Ireland exchanged glances as the doors slammed behind the professor. Her footsteps were loud, her usually stoic face now held her eyebrows pinched together. The class fell silent, feeling the frustration and anger radiate from the woman. She went on the computer, pulling up the files as her bag slammed onto the ground, echoing into the silence. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“¡Mierda! Esto es tan jodidamente estúpido,” </span>
</em>
<span>she muttered under her breath, causing some of the other students to shift uncomfortably. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The whispers flew across campus about Dr. Maximoff. A student overheard an HR person talking to her outside Dr. Vidal’s office, hearing something about a warning being issued and for now, to stay as far as possible away from Dr. Harkness. William couldn’t believe what he was hearing. He knew the woman was flirting with the notorious strict professor, but he couldn’t fathom the extent of it, and worse, it seemed to have pissed off the Dean even more. He cringed, glancing at Ireland. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you think Dr. Harkness is going to be worse?” he muttered, but even then it felt too loud. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ireland simply took out a paper, writing down, </span>
<em>
<span>You think it’s true then? Maximoff went too far?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Another note was passed from Ryan, </span>
<em>
<span>I heard she harassed Harkness at a bar. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Eva nodded, at that adding to her own paper, </span>
<em>
<span>I heard that too. I also heard Vidal was there too. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Ireland, tilted her head, writing: </span>
<em>
<span>I told you they were friends. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Ryan rolled his eyes, but quickly swiped the paper away when they heard the heel clicks behind them. The group turned to their professor, slamming packets on the table, her face now masked with her usual stoicism, but it didn’t hide the anger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have the two full hours for the exam. Phones away. Do </span>
<em>
<span>not </span>
</em>
<span>start until I say so.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The group finished just as the two hours were up. It was hard, harder than any of them had prepared for and each one of them felt themselves shake as they approached the professor who was scrolling separately on her computer. When she noticed them approaching, she exited out of whatever it was, crossing her legs as her fingers played with something on her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Time’s up!” her voice rang over the silence, forcing the students to line up behind them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>William had his gaze locked to her finger though, finding a giant amethyst on her ring finger, an unmistakable wedding band. He was right. Dr. Vidal was married, but to whom was the next question. He handed in his test, running out with his friends as they all looked at each other, seeming to have noticed the same thing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That stone was huge,” Ryan said when they exited the building. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my God, yeah, but why purple?” Ireland replied, fixing her bag on her shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The boys stared at her, “What do you mean?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ireland shook her shoulders, “I wouldn’t have guessed </span>
<em>
<span>her </span>
</em>
<span>to wear a color other than green or black. Purple is more…” her voice trailed off, looking up at Poets’ Haven. </span>
</p><p>
<span>William groaned, “Don’t even go there– you guys are crazy if you really think that!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eva elbowed him lightly, “Oh come on, purple– the purple witch of Poets’ Haven?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s a fucking stretch,” Ryan agreed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>William nodded, “Be so for real, right now. Dr. Harkness doesn’t even have a ring and who would be willing to marry either of them.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Somebody did!” Eva chuckled. “Okay, just be delusional with me for ten minutes. Dr. Vidal and Dr. Harkness, both women of power and very secretive about their personal life. Dr. Vidal, her boss, doesn’t want to make a scene or have her authority be undermined and they agree to keep their marriage a secret. Maximoff comes along and changes the game. Come on, it’s kinda cute too. Imagine Vidal going home with Harkness and they then come here and act like strangers.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>William rolled his eyes, “You are desperate for any love story.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Guilty,” Eva chirped. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ireland stopped them, “Didn’t you mention Dr. Vidal graduated from Harvard, William?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>He nodded, his eyebrows creased. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where did Harkness study?” Ryan added, seeming to follow Ireland’s train of thought. </span>
</p><p>
<span>William groaned, as they entered the building, “You guys are obsessed. Harkness doesn’t even have a ring. So, I am stopping your delusions in your tracks.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The group gathered into the classroom, finding most of the students already filling the seats. Looking at each other, they collectively sighed. The only seats left open were in the front. They sat down together as silence filled the room. It was the last class of the day and William couldn’t wait to go home and sleep. It had already been too long of a day and he was pretty sure Vidal’s test had destroyed him. He looked up the moment the professor walked in. She was in her signature purple, deep purple dress hung around her loosely, the sleeves rolled up, and a giant amethyst necklace wrapped around her neck. It was nothing new. He was pretty sure she wore it every day. But the thing that caught his attention– and he wasn’t the only one who noticed as other students’ jaws dropped, all of their eyes trained as Dr. Harkness’ fingers. On her left hand, sparkling faintly in the light was a giant emerald ring. Unlike Vidal’s, the band was gold, but it was unmistakable and this close, he could tell it cut into a heart. Black stones and more diamonds surrounded it, fading into the band itself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Harkness was married with a ring that was green…</span>
</p><p>
<span>The group all turned to look at each as William couldn’t seem to pick up his jaw. Eva kicked him from the side, Ryan slapping him on the arm from behind. He knew what they wanted him to ask. It was to everyone’s surprise that Dr. Harkness was almost kinder with him, as if he were the favorite. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He cleared his throat, “Dr. Harkness?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman looked up, her icy gaze boring into him and freezing him on the spot. She didn’t bother to mask her irritation, and worse, she looked just as angry as Dr. Vidal. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He swallowed hard, “Is the ring new?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” she deadpanned, turning her gaze back to her notes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>This time Ireland nudged him, “Oh, so how long have you been married?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The gaze was worse than Vidal’s. It wasn’t the stoic harsh gaze she had when she was annoyed, no this was worse. Her eyes glinted, her upper lip drawing into a sneer as she pinned him into his seat with the look. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t see how that’s relevant to the talk of monstrosity in </span>
<em>
<span>The Museum of Extraordinary Things. </span>
</em>
<span>Open to page ninety-four in your textbooks.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>He flinched as Ireland and Eva shared a look. They would definitely be taking a look at the staff page on the Westview University website later to see Harkness’ alma mater. </span>

<span>She hummed softly, a softer and deeper breath tickling her neck as she shifted slightly, pressing a gentle kiss in a curly brunette mane. Rio was pinned in place, her arms stiff and her bad knee ached with a fathom pain telling her to straighten it. She did slowly, wincing slightly as it cracked before a warmer leg was holding her in place again. She rolled her eyes fondly, the head against her neck nuzzling closer to her, as if to fuse with her very own body. Her shirt was tightened in Agatha’s hand, the other mindless drumming her fingers on Rio’s sternum. Rio continued humming as she stared at her phone over Agatha’s head, trying to read her emails for today. The past couple of days, she found her wife more cuddly. It was strange, Agatha usually liked her space most of the time, except for when they were in bed at night where both of them would swap being little spoons. However, something changed starting Monday, after they got home from work. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio had set her papers down on the dining room table before going into the kitchen and starting dinner. It was Agatha’s turn, but she needed this. She figured her wife didn’t want to talk after she got upset at her for snapping and keeping things ‘unprofessional.’ It led to a small fight in Rio’s own office during lunch, and both of them were in a foul mood for the rest of the day. Of course, during her students’ quiz, she decided to take her mind off it by looking at baby things: cribs, carriers, toys, little outfits, a perfect stroller she already put in her cart, and even baby names. That was until a student approached with their quiz and she was snapped back to her reality of her wife and she had fought. The drive home was quiet. They didn’t speak, knowing the other one was finally cooling off and taking time to reflect. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Making dinner relaxed her, her frustration coming to a halt as she prepared, grabbing the ingredients, potatoes, bacon, chicken broth, and some cream cheese. She started off simple, cutting up the potatoes and placing them in the broth before starting the stove. The bacon was next and just as she got them to cool, she went to turn, grabbing her bottle of water, warm hands wrapped around her waist, causing her to jump. She turned slowly, finding her wife but before she could see her face, it was buried into the crook of her neck. Warmth encircled her, lips pressed lazily against her neck as she slowly wrapped her arms back around her. Agatha murmured something against her neck, and the only reason she knew was the slight vibration there. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What did you say, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>?” she asked quietly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha Harkness apologising… while it wasn’t unheard of, it certainly was rare after their fights. Normally, her wife would do something for her, like buy her plants, a ridiculously expensive necklace or bracelet, or packets of the freeze-dried strawberries she adored and could easily eat without stopping. When they weren’t fighting, Agatha had to hide the packets, making Rio have to ask for them like a child. It infuriated her, but her wife had a point. So apologising, instead of gift-giving caught her completely off guard. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” she couldn’t help but ask. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife scoffed, but kept firmly against her, “You heard me. Don’t push your luck.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t but her wife was firmly attached to her the rest of that night. It was strange, in the most loving way possible. Agatha didn’t leave her once she did apologize, instead, stayed leaning against her as she finished dinner. When they did eat, her wife was holding her hand. When Rio went to clean up, Agatha scowled at her until she sat down on the couch. In seconds, she was curled up against her side. Hell, Rio couldn’t even shower alone without her wife following her and holding onto her. By Tuesday morning, Agatha had somehow wormed her way on top of Rio, but the only issue was getting the woman out of bed and getting to work on time, which they were both late. During their lunch, her wife insisted on sitting on the couch and then leaned into her the whole time. And the previous night, it was the repeat of the night before. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, Rio laid on her side, Agatha trying to somehow fuse their bodies together as she dozed in and out of sleep. One point earlier in the morning, Rio had gotten up to pee and the moment she was close enough to the bed again, Agatha dragged her in. Who would have thought pregnancy would make Agatha Harkness clingy? </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shifted again, the stray hairs from her wife’s head tickling her chin. There was nothing new from work, but as Rio glanced at the time, she realized she had to start waking her wife to get to the ultrasound in time. She turned off her phone, placing soft kisses on her wife’s head, knowing she would get the kindest response that way. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Mi vida, </span>
</em>
<span>it’s time to wake up. We have to leave soon,” she spoke softly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed her annoyance, but instead of pulling away, she pulled Rio closer against her, refusing to let go, “Fuck off.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, kissing down to her cheek before tucking her hair behind her ear. Leaning forward she whispered softly, “The ultrasound is today, </span>
<em>
<span>mi vida. </span>
</em>
<span>We get to see our baby.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife sat up, her hair a mess as she grabbed Rio’s phone looking at the time. Without another word, she stood walking to the bathroom. Rio waited a moment before catching her wife was fine. She made her way into the kitchen, putting in toast and starting tea. Excitement ran through her, she was practically bouncing as she waltzed into their room, going through her draws to fish out her sweat pants, only to find her favorite pair missing. Cursing to herself, she found her black ones, putting them on and adding a dark green long sleeve. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Walking into the bathroom she spoke, “</span>
<em>
<span>Mi amor, </span>
</em>
<span>have you seen my green sweatpants? I swore I put them–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She froze, seeing her wife brushing her hair in the mirror wearing none other than the green sweatpants she was looking for. They have been together for fifteen years and yet Rio swore something in her always short circuited when her wife wore her clothes. Her eyes widened as her mouth remained open, a rush running through her as her wife hummed softly, purposely ignoring her as she threw her hair up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, sorry, my love,” she teased, her voice still thick with sleep, before looking up at her through the mirror. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The blue eyes rolled at her as she stepped back, facing Rio and placing a quick kiss to her cheek, “You can stare later, my love.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, momentarily caught off guard, before quickly shaking herself from her stupor. She had long grown accustomed to Agatha’s effortless beauty, whether it was in a sharp suit or a worn-out pair of sweatpants. Yet, every time she saw her wife in her clothes, there was something that made her heart stutter, a flutter in her chest that never got old. She fought to keep the blush from rising up her neck, her pulse quickening with that all-too-familiar warmth spreading through her veins. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As the minutes ticked by, Rio found herself sneaking glances at her wife, each one feeling like a stolen moment. Agatha was stunning, radiating a quiet beauty that seemed to grow with every passing day. And today, they were about to see their baby for the first time. Even though their little one was still the size of a grape, the excitement was undeniable. Rio quickly gathered the necessary paperwork, her fingers trembling just slightly, before watching Agatha shrug on her coat and hastily slip on her sneakers. She tossed Rio the car keys with a grin, and Rio felt a rush of love swell in her chest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>In the car, Rio’s nerves were a whirlwind, her emotions jumping from anxiety to excitement with every beat of her heart. Her fingers drummed nervously on the steering wheel, but the moment Agatha’s warm hand rested on her knee, everything stilled. That touch grounded her, soothing the storm inside. Soon, her wife was putting on music, something simple to push the minute hand faster. The gentle strums and harmony of Gigi Perez instantly filled the car, and following was the piano tune of Fleetwood Mac. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can we get McDonald’s after this?” Agatha’s voice broke through the music, and Rio’s attention snapped from the road to her wife. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her gaze flicked from Agatha to the looming golden arches ahead, disbelief in her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio said, her voice half-laughing, “You </span>
<em>
<span>hate</span>
</em>
<span> McDonald’s.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged, her shoulders lifting in a playful, exaggerated motion, “I want their fries.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised an eyebrow, smirking, “You </span>
<em>
<span>hate</span>
</em>
<span> their fries.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a quick glance, a slight frown on her lips, “I’m pregnant. I get to change my mind.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She chuckled softly, reaching over and placing her hand on her wife’s stomach, “Alright, my love. Anything else?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, “Nando’s.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>And how could Rio say no to that? </span>
</p><p align="center">
<strong>***</strong>
</p><p>
<span>Upon arriving at the clinic, Rio checked them in, and they found themselves in the waiting room. Rio watched as her wife bounced her leg, her hand becoming sweaty in hers. Her eyebrows were furrowed as she absent mindedly rubbed her stomach. Rio gazed around for a moment, knowing Agatha would feel even more uncomfortable if Rio tried comforting her in front of people. Across from them were a younger couple, the woman heavily pregnant, her eyes closed as her husband went over paperwork. To the right of them, sitting and bouncing her leg just as much as her wife was a single mother, maybe a few months along, her stomach only slightly round. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned in, murmuring softly in Spanish to her wife, “</span>
<em>
<span>Es solo un chequeo mi amor. Todo estará bien.</span>
</em>
<span>” She placed a hand on her knee, steadying her bouncing. “</span>
<em>
<span>Nuestro bebé está sano. Estás sano y ya sabes que él tiene la fuerza y ​​la lucha de Harkness. Aunque tendrá todo mi encanto."</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She earned a small smile from her wife, who rolled her eyes and shook her head, “You are so dead set they are a boy.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head, before nodding, “Of course, plus I think we should confirm at the eighteenth week mark, that way it will soften the blow when he comes out looking like me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re impossible,” Agatha snorted quietly, before the door opened from the side of the desk. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha Harkness-Vidal,” a nurse called. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart fluttered at the sound of her wife’s name, her protectiveness prickling as she stood up with her. Her wife smoothed her shirt for a moment, before stepping ahead of her. Rio followed closely behind, her hand on her back to offer a quiet reassurance as they entered long white halls. Pictures of fetuses lined them, each in a different stage. She could feel the tension radiating from her wife, but she kept her focus ahead, offering a calm presence. As the nurse neared the end of the hall, the nurse opened a wooden door, flicking one of the colored flags and nodding them in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Go ahead and put on the gown. The doctor will be in shortly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio followed her wife to the table, looking around at the monitors that hummed faintly. A screen was on the wall, clearly meant to show the baby as a sterile scent filled her senses. Turning back to her wife, she came behind her, kissing her head softly before taking her clothes from her. She smiled faintly at her wife’s exposed skin making Agatha shove her playfully as she put the gown on. Rio carefully tied the back, her hands slightly trembling before her wife awkwardly adjusted herself on the table. Agatha fidgeted with her wedding ring, twisting it in circles nervously, and her heart swelled at the sight of her wife’s vulnerability. There was something about seeing Agatha like this– uncharacteristically unprepared, unguarded, and so entirely unsure that made Rio want to protect her more. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know,” Rio spoke softly, breaking the silence, “We are doing this together, </span>
<em>
<span>mi vida. </span>
</em>
<span>It will be alright.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her a half-smile, though the nervousness was still visible in her eyes, “I know, it’s just… I keep thinking…” She paused for a moment, leaning back, her eyes darting to the ceiling as she let the words hang in the air. “I can’t help but think of my own mother. I don’t want her anywhere near this child. I don’t want them to have a childhood like me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a deep breath, stepping forward and cupping her wife’s cheek, “</span>
<em>
<span>Mi amor, </span>
</em>
<span>we have talked about this before. You are </span>
<em>
<span>nothing </span>
</em>
<span>like your mother. This baby will be so loved by both of us and you know very well, I would end up in prison before letting that cunt near them.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed her laughter, “I don’t doubt that, my love.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She closed her eyes for a moment, taking a slow breath, her hand coming to rest on her stomach, as if to reassure herself. Rio could see the silent fight in her eyes, the struggle between the overwhelming excitement of becoming a mother and the deep-rooted fears that clung to her from her past. Before Rio could say anything else, a knock echoed softly, shattering the intimacy between them, shifting into the clinical reality of the appointment. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife spoke to allow them in, welcoming a younger woman in a long white coat, her blonde hair tied neatly behind her as she held her hand out to Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hello Agatha, I am Dr. Walsh,” she said brightly and shook her hand before holding it out to Rio. “And you must be the wife.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She shook her hand, “Rio.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Today, we will be doing a transvaginal ultrasound for a seven week scan. Afterwards, we will set up your twelve week appointment. How are we feeling today? How are your symptoms as well?” she asked, clicking through the computer before the machine hummed to life. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She watched her wife inhale, meeting her gaze briefly, before turning back to her, “Nausea is still there, but is it not as bad as before. Just… a lot of fatigue. It comes and goes.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Walsh nodded, her expression professional but warm, “That’s pretty typical in the early stages, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Anything else you’ve been experiencing? Any discomfort?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated for a moment as Rio raised an eyebrow. Of course her wife was hiding something from her, “I’ve had some cramping, but nothing too severe. Just a lot of changes, I think.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand instinctively reached out, her fingers brushing against Agatha’s, slightly annoyed that her wife didn’t tell her. It instantly vanished as her wife caught her eyes again, smiling softly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s perfectly normal,” Dr. Walsh said reassuringly. “Your body is adjusting to the pregnancy, and cramping can occur as your uterus expands. Just be sure to rest when you need to. And if anything feels off, don’t hesitate to let me know. And cravings?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked this time, “Oh, I think it kicked in today. She asked for McDonald’s when she typically hates it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The doctor laughed slightly as her wife glared at her, “Be prepared for the three am cravings. Just be sure not to eat too much fast food, but every now and then won’t hurt. Now,” she stopped, glancing between them “how about we see this little one?” </span>
</p><p>
<span> Agatha gave a nervous nod, her hand still clutching Rio’s. Dr. Walsh picked up the wand, placing a cover over it and turning to them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Go ahead and set your legs up. Today, I just want to check on your uterus and ovaries, and get some measurements of your little one. We’ll see if we can detect a heartbeat, but don’t be alarmed if we don’t hear it. Your baby’s heart isn’t fully formed yet. Your little one might not look like a baby today, but at twelve weeks, when you come back, we’ll be able to count their fingers and toes.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>As Dr. Walsh spoke, she adjusted the footrests, and Agatha carefully reclined back, settling her head on the pillow. Her gaze drifted toward the ceiling, her eyes unfocused. Rio stayed by her side, her grip on Agatha’s hand steady and strong, offering silent comfort as her wife’s breath became slightly quicker. The air in the room felt heavier, charged with anticipation, and Rio’s heart beat in sync with her wife’s. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Estas bien, mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>,” Rio whispered, her voice low, steady, a calmness meant only for Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha squeezed her hand tightly in response, though her eyes were wide, still looking at the ceiling. She inhaled deeply, trying to steady herself as the doctor moved toward the ultrasound machine again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This will be a little uncomfortable,” Dr. Walsh said, her voice professional yet gentle. “Are you ready?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded along with Agatha, her eyes briefly flicking to the screen before returning to Dr. Walsh’s focused expression. As the doctor positioned herself, Agatha’s grip tightened, her fingers pressing into Rio’s palm, her body tense. A flash of discomfort crossed Agatha’s face, and she muttered a quiet curse under her breath, her expression shifting from nervousness to something more vulnerable. Rio’s hand, the one closest to her, shifted to Agatha’s hair, her fingers weaving gently through it in a soothing motion. The moment Rio’s touch found her, Agatha relaxed, her tension easing, though she kept her grip on Rio firm, never letting go. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, and there they are,” Dr. Walsh said softly, turning toward the screen and pointing at the image. </span>
</p><p>
<span>At first, it was just a faint, blurry blob, barely discernible, and then it hit Rio, not just in her chest, but all the way down to her bones. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Lub-dub. Lub-dub. Lub-dub</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The unmistakable sound of a heartbeat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A tiny, rhythmic pulse. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath caught in her throat, and for a moment, it felt like time itself had paused. The rest of the world faded away as the sound of that heartbeat, fragile and strong at once, filled her senses. Her heart pounded in her chest as everything in her stilled. The words she had prepared felt foreign in her mouth, and her thoughts scattered in the face of this new, overwhelming reality. Her wife wasn’t just carrying a child– this was </span>
<em>
<span>their</span>
</em>
<span> child. The sound of life, so simple, so pure, grounded her in a way nothing else ever could. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes darted toward the screen now, and there it was– the little white shape, nestled among shadows, small yet distinct, as the doctor took measurements, completely unaware of the emotional flood that was overtaking Rio. The baby was there. It wasn’t an idea anymore. It wasn’t a dream or a hope. It was real, and it was </span>
<em>
<span>theirs</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio couldn’t breathe. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She watched the small, alien-like shape on the screen, trying to hold onto the moment while the world continued around her. Her hands trembled as she squeezed her wife’s, her fingers still brushing through Agatha’s hair as she fought to regain composure. It wasn’t until the soft click of the ultrasound machine stopped that Rio realized she was blinking back tears. When she turned her eyes to Agatha, they were already there– her wife’s cheeks wet with silent tears, falling freely. It was a rare sight. Agatha had always been so composed, so steady, that seeing her this exposed, this overwhelmed, felt like a gift. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>,” Rio whispered, gently wiping the tears from Agatha’s face with her thumb. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She leaned down, pressing a kiss to her forehead, her heart pounding as she looked into her wife’s eyes. Agatha met her gaze, and the words she whispered broke Rio in ways she didn’t expect. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re real,” her voice cracked, thick with emotion. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was no denying the tenderness in the way she said it. Her eyes searched Rio’s for something, for reassurance, for understanding. Rio could only nod, her hand brushing against Agatha’s wet cheeks before her own tears came, unbidden and unstoppable. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>. They’re real.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s gaze softened, and a small, trembling smile tugged at the corner of her lips, “Our baby.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Our baby,” Rio echoed, her voice hushed with awe. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>The doctor confirmed everything was healthy. Agatha and the baby were doing wonderful, and were on track. The next appointment was a week before finals, and there was a growing anticipation to see their baby look like a baby. But as Rio sat in the parking lot of Nando’s, waiting for their order, she found herself staring at the blob of white from the pictures their doctor printed. Agatha held her hand, still wiping some of her tears as they both stared in an awed silence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We are really doing this,” her wife spoke, breaking the quiet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, turning to face her, “We are, and you’re going to be the best mama.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled for real at her, a blush creeping up her neck. Rio leaned forward, her wife meeting her half-way as they shared a tender kiss. More warmth washed over Rio, as her lips moved even and sure against her wife’s, speaking their love and promise to each other. Her wife kissed back in the same fever– the way they both wanted to kiss the moment the heartbeat filled the room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The sound of Rio’s phone interrupted them and she pulled back, a smile on her lips, “Alright, time to feed the little alien and you, of course.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled slightly, “You’re such an idiot.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio only grinned, kissing her wife quickly and running into the grab their order.</span>
</p><p align="center">
<strong>***</strong>
</p><p>
<span>After Rio grabbed everything her wife requested, they returned home, immediately falling onto the couch together. Agatha curled up into Rio’s side, digging in at her McDonald’s fries and gulping down her Nando’s chicken. Her head rested against her shoulder as </span>
<em>
<span>Friends </span>
</em>
<span>played in the background. They ate in comfortable silence, the occasional giggle or smile shared between bites. Once they finished, Rio threw the trash away and came back to pull Agatha back into her embrace, tucking her close. Agatha continued to stare at the photos, her thumb brushing over the tiny image of their baby. Rio kissed the side of her wife’s head repeatedly, feeling the softness of her hair and the warmth of her presence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love you,” Rio whispered, her voice filled with the weight of everything she felt– too much to be contained in just those three words, but she had no better way to express the depth of her heart. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her black heart beat for Agatha, for the family they were becoming, and for the life growing inside her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips curved into a soft smile, her voice a whisper of tenderness, “I love you more.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Just then, her stomach rumbled, and both of them chuckled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mmm, the little alien wants more,” Rio teased, her smile widening. “How about I go make some tea and slice up an apple or two? Keep that growing alien happy.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, resting her hand on her stomach as she leaned into Rio, “You spoil us both, you know that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Anything for whom my heart beats for,” she replied, kissing her cheek and standing up. “Go ahead and send the coven the picture. I am sure they are dying to hear from us.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tossed Agatha her phone, knowing Agatha rarely texted anyone. She heard the soft devious laughter from her wife as she started the kettle and pulled out the apples, cutting them easily. When she came back her wife immediately took them from her, leaning into her again as they waited for a response. They didn’t have to wait long as both of their phones started buzzing with an onslaught of messages. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Below the single picture of the ultrasound, without a caption came Lilia and Alice: </span>

<span>Rio smirked, shaking her head as she typed something into her phone. But just before hitting send, she changed her mind, backspacing everything. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, she leaned into Agatha and whispered, “Let’s leave them hanging a little longer.” </span>
</p><p>

<span>Rio chuckled, tossing her phone aside and pulling Agatha closer. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let them stew. It’ll do them good.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed in agreement, nuzzling into Rio’s neck, “The longer they wait, the more dramatic their reactions will be. Perfect entertainment for a quiet night in.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s lips pressed softly to Agatha’s temple, her voice low and affectionate, “You really are wicked, my love.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you married me anyway,” Agatha replied, a teasing lilt in her voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha eventually fell asleep against her, Rio following with her, filled with utter contentment and warmth. By the time they opened their eyes, it was night and only a low glow from the setting sun casted into the room. Rio sat up, looking for the source that woke her when their front door rattled from someone banging on it. She chuckled, kissing her wife’s cheek to wake her up a little gentler. She rubbed her eyes as she turned on the lights, and the excitement of the day came back like a tsunami, crashing into her as the smile was infectious on her face. Glancing back at her wife, she made her way to the door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“RIO HARKNESS-VIDAL! OPEN UP YOU BITCH!” Alice screamed through the door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio paused at the door, stifling a laugh as she glanced back at Agatha, who was lazily stretching on the couch, still half-asleep. The golden light of the setting sun bathed her wife, accentuating her serene expression. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“They really couldn’t wait, could they?” Agatha smirked, propping herself up on one elbow, her sleepy eyes sparkling with mischief. “Let them stew out there a little longer. They’ve earned it after all the years they’ve pestered us.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The pounding grew louder, echoing through the house like thunder. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We know you’re in there!” Lilia’s voice cut through the commotion, her tone bordering on desperation. “Don’t make us hex this door!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised an eyebrow, her lips quirking in a grin, “They sound </span>
<em>
<span>desperate</span>
</em>
<span>.” She glanced back at Agatha, her voice dropping to a whisper, “We should have recorded this.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Would’ve been perfect for the scrapbook,” Agatha replied with a chuckle, her voice soft yet laced with her usual sass. </span>
</p><p>
<span>With a dramatic sigh, Rio opened the door, revealing Alice and Lilia in all their disheveled glory. Alice’s face was flushed, strands of her usually neat hair falling messily around her face. Lilia, by contrast, looked less angry and more like someone on the verge of a breakdown. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Finally!” Alice burst through the doorway, pointing an accusatory finger at Rio. “What the hell was that photo? WHO. IS. PREGNANT?!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia followed closely behind, her arms crossed tightly over her chest, a storm brewing in her dark eyes, “You two are insufferable. Insufferable!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stepped aside, gesturing toward the living room with exaggerated calm, “Please, come in. Make yourselves at home. Can I get you anything to drink?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice ignored the sarcasm, storming over to her wife, who was now sitting up, smirking up at their friends. Her calm demeanor only seemed to fuel Alice’s frustration. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” she hissed, as though trying not to yell, “tell me right now. Is it you? Is it Rio? Or is this some kind of cruel, twisted joke?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head, her lips curling into a small, amused smile, “Why would we joke about something like that?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice threw her hands up in exasperation, “Because it’s you! Because you two </span>
<em>
<span>live</span>
</em>
<span> to mess with people!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia’s voice was quieter but no less urgent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Seriously, guys. Is one of you actually pregnant? Because if this is a prank–” her voice cracked slightly, betraying the genuine emotion behind her words. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s teasing expression softened at that, her gaze shifting to Rio. Rio watched the strange softness span across her face in a quiet shock and if Rio didn’t move, then sure that expression would give it away. Instead, she sat down, bumping her wife playfully. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Guess,” she said simply, bringing back the playful expression onto her wife. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia almost snarled, raking her hands through her hair as she threw her coat to the couch, “Rio, I swear, if you make us guess, I’m going to lose my mind.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed, “You mean what’s left of it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She earned a sharp stare from both women and Alice spoke, “We have been overanalyzing that damn photo for hours! Who the fuck is it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched as her wife leaned into her, her eyes narrowing playfully as that beautiful smirk graced her lips, “Why are you two so dramatic? We send one little picture, and suddenly you’re banging down our door.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“One little picture?” Alice repeated through her teeth. “You dropped a Peeta Mellark! What did you think we’d do? Sit back and sip tea?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s exactly what we did,” Rio quipped, her smirk widening as she relaxed into the cushions beside her wife. “It’s been highly entertaining, by the way.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia’s gaze softened for a split second before she snapped back to her stern facade, “Don’t change the subject. You’re stalling. Just answer the question!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips twitched, suppressing a laugh as she turned to Rio, “Should we make them wait a little longer?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced at their friends, feigning thoughtfulness as Alice practically vibrated with impatience, “I don’t know. They seem close to breaking.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She laughed more as Alice snarled, “You two are a match made in fucking hell, you absolute witches.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, we are, aren’t we,” Rio smiled at her wife, watching the way her blue eyes twinkled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stop doing that!” Alice barked at them, forcing them to pull away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed dramatically, “Fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, she reached out, placing her hand protectively on her wife’s stomach. She watched as the simple gesture stunned the women before them into silence. Alice dropped to a nearby chair as Lilia stood frozen, her hands up to her mouth as Rio felt her wife’s fingers lace with her own over her stomach. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Lilia breathed, her voice catching as the realization hit her. “You’re… pregnant.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips curled into a small, knowing smile as she nodded, her eyes twinkling with mischief, “That’s right.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>With an exaggerated tilt of her head, she gestured toward Rio, jabbing her thumb in her direction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And this one,” she said, her tone dripping with mock exasperation, “decided to knock me up.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice snorted, a laugh bursting from her before she clamped a hand over her mouth. Her shoulders shook as she struggled to contain herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my goddess,” she wheezed. “Leave it to Rio to get another woman pregnant.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised an unimpressed eyebrow, the corner of her mouth twitching into a smirk. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Naturally,” she replied with mock grandeur. “I am </span>
<em>
<span>the</span>
</em>
<span> green witch, after all. Miracles are kind of my thing.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re insufferable, that’s what you are,” Lilia shot back, rolling her eyes. </span>
<span>But despite her tone, the fondness in her voice was undeniable. She shook her head as if trying to process the news, then let out a soft laugh, </span>
<span>“Oh, to the Divine Mother. You two are really going to be moms.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smirk only deepened, her confidence radiating as she exchanged a glance with Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Moms,” she echoed, the word rolling off her tongue like a promise that Rio’s heart fluttered all over again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched Alice as she stood, her own glint in her eye, “Well, congrats, you two. I </span>
<em>
<span>can’t wait </span>
</em>
<span>for the day when your own spawn gives you a taste of your medicine. You two deserve it.”</span>

<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat back on the couch, her hand on her stomach as Lilia sat across from her, wiping the tears from her eyes. Agatha could only smile, her chest warm, as her hand remained over the life growing inside her– the life her and her wife created. They were really doing this. They were going to be moms and for the first time since staring at the stupid little positive pregnancy test, Agatha felt the reality hit hard. Never in her life did she imagine herself becoming a mother.</p><p>At eighteen, the day after she graduated high school, she packed her shit and snuck out of her mother’s house and into Lilia’s awaiting car. Her mother had her setup to go to Oxford, and as much as it was her dream, Agatha couldn’t go. One, she didn’t earn it. Her rich mother bought her way in and would be paying for everything and therefore, could hold it over Agatha and two, it wasn’t even for literature. It was some research program that would lead to Agatha working for her mother’s company. She <em> had </em>to escape after the abuse and homophobia. Sure, it would be out of the country and she would be free from her mother, but she knew her mother would have eyes on her even from there across the sea.</p><p>Agatha needed to start anew, away from Evanora Harkness. </p><p>She planned it in middle school, working under the table at a dingy diner before working as a barista. The cafe was a thirty minute walk, but it was worth it, especially the long hours and overtime. Agatha took everything she could, on top of remaining the top of her class. When she applied for Harvard, it had been on a dare from Lilia, but when she received the email, learning she somehow received a full ride, she couldn’t turn it down. Lilia was beside her, admitted into Harvard and together, before they graduated with the help of Lilia’s parents, they rented a shared apartment and moved in together. She was finally free. She bought a new phone, changed her number, and deleted her social media, and shit, did she thrive in college… </p><p>Then, she ran into Rio Vidal. </p><p>Meeting Rio, hating Rio, and finally falling in love with the little shit changed everything. Agatha never planned on falling in love, in fact she actively avoided it. Too much was at stake; she was effectively on her own in college, no one to fall back on, her only reliance was Lilia, who paid more in the shared rent with the help of her parents. Her goal was to graduate early while also earning her masters, and throwing herself into a PhD program. Then, find the earliest job opportunity and stay the fuck away from her mother. There was no woman to fall in love with on her bingo card, no fiancée, no marriage, and certainly, there was no family on her fucking bingo card; but, Rio had appeared as if she clawed her way through the earth to arrive at Agatha’s feet, and take her down a completely different road. </p><p>This infuriating little shit captured her heart, took her down a road, and showed her what true love was, and with that went all of her carefully crafted walls to protect herself with. And all Rio had to do with was show up to apartment with flowers, hold her when she fell asleep after Agatha marched to her dorm at three am, and have their first fucking date be under the stars. And then this infuriating little shit, after five years of being together, had randomly muttered that she wanted to marry and Agatha had agreed without a single doubt. They got married, and then Rio… oh her sweet darling Rio, had to go and hold a fucking baby, and it was that same night, the last of Agatha’s walls had crumbled. </p><p>She remembered Rio’s old college roommate meeting up with them, holding her ten-month old daughter and she had grown stiff, uneasy by the tiny little human. Hela had simply handed her daughter to Rio, and in that moment, the world froze again. Agatha, most proud of keeping her emotions in check, of being in control, cracked. She sat across from her wife as Rio held that tiny, squirming bundle of innocence, and something happened inside her. Rio’s fingers, calloused from years of work, were impossibly gentle as they cradled the baby’s head. Her brown eyes, usually sharp with wit or blazing with intensity, softened to the kind of warmth that could melt glaciers. She cooed softly, brushing a thumb across the baby’s chubby cheek. Agatha, for the life of her, couldn’t breathe. </p><p>“She’s beautiful, Hela,” Rio had murmured, her voice dipped in awe. “What’s her name?” </p><p>“Lilith,” Hela had replied, her smile fond. “She’s a handful, but she’s worth every sleepless night.”</p><p>Rio had chuckled, the sound low and soft, and Agatha’s heart stumbled in her chest. She wasn’t sure if it was the way Rio held Lilith like she was the most precious thing in the world, or the way her wife’s lips curved into a tender smile, but something monumental shifted inside her. Agatha wasn’t even sure she wanted kids before this. She’d told herself it was impractical– messy, chaotic, and far too vulnerable. Yet, watching Rio cradle a baby, every argument she had carefully crafted crumbled into dust. </p><p>“She likes you,” Hela had said with a grin, noticing the way Lilith’s tiny hand wrapped around Rio’s finger. </p><p>“Of course she does,” Rio had smirked before returning the soft smile, her attention shifting back to the baby. “She has excellent taste.” </p><p>Agatha wanted to roll her eyes, but she couldn’t muster the will. All she could do was stare at her wife, completely captivated by the scene unfolding in front of her. </p><p>“She’s lucky to have a mother like you, Hela,” Rio added, her tone soft. </p><p>“And you?” Hela had asked, her gaze flicking between the two of them. “You two ever thought about having one of your own?” </p><p>Agatha had stiffened slightly, the question slicing through the haze of warmth that had wrapped around her. She remembered bracing herself for Rio to laugh it off or change the subject. After all, they’d never really talked about it, not seriously. But Rio simply had surprised her. A small, contemplative smile had tugged at her lips as she glanced at Agatha, their eyes meeting. </p><p>“Maybe,” Rio had whispered. “Someday.” </p><p>Agatha’s breath had been caught. It was just one word– <em> maybe </em>– but it carried a weight that slammed into her like a freight train. In that moment, she saw a future she had never dared to imagine: late-night feedings, tiny hands tugging at their clothes, first steps, first words, and Rio– always Rio– by her side through it all. </p><p>When they left the café later that evening, Rio didn’t notice the way Agatha was quieter than usual, her blue eyes distant as if lost in thought. But that night, as they lay in bed, Agatha rolled over to face her wife. </p><p>“Rio?” she murmured, her voice hesitant. </p><p>Rio lifted her head, her brown eyes glowing in the dim light. </p><p>“Yeah, <em> mi amor </em>?”</p><p>Agatha remembered freezing, the words stuck in her throat as she stared at her wife. She swallowed hard, searching those eyes, but only finding a promise of understanding, and yet, she still couldn’t bring the words to her mouth. It was clear as day in her mind, how Rio moved closer, her hands caressing Agatha’s cheeks, her touch grounding for a moment, but it still felt too big to ask, too much to say. It felt life changing, and it was. It was another fucking road she wasn’t prepared to take, and even fathoming of taking, but here Rio was, holding her face, and staring at her with those stupid puppy dog eyes that she would follow anywhere. The image flashed again of Rio holding the baby and oh, how she wanted to straggle the little shit for breaking down her walls. </p><p>“Iwanttohaveababywithyou,” she blurted out in one breath. </p><p>Rio had blinked for a second, her eyebrows creasing in confusion, “<em> Mi amor, </em>you know English is not my first language. I have no idea what you just said.”</p><p>Agatha had covered her face with her hands for a moment, but Rio moved closer, pressing their bodies together and pushing her hands away. Rio’s fingers were gentle, brushing the hair away as she stared into her eyes. Agatha had felt herself take a deep breath, closing her eyes to steady herself. </p><p>When she met her wife’s eyes, her voice came out in a soft whisper, “Rio, my love, I want to have a baby. I want to have your baby. I can’t stop seeing the way you held Hela’s daughter, and to the Goddess– Rio, I want to see you become a mother and be one with you. I know we never talked about, fuck– I didn’t, or I least never– fuck I–”</p><p>Lips had pressed against hers, effectively stopping her rambling. Rio caressed her cheek, turning them and straddling her hips. Rio’s kiss was hungry, all consuming, but it poured a love Agatha still remembered as if it happened only moments ago. </p><p>Rio had barely pulled away before whispering against her lips, “I want that too.” </p><p> </p><p>And now, Agatha sat in their home, pregnant with Rio’s child, her best friend across from her and her wife and Alice in the kitchen.  </p><p>“So how many weeks along are you?” Lilia spoke softly, knocking Agatha from her trance. </p><p>She smiled, “Only seven, but our doctor said we can share with a few very close friends, plus, I needed to explain Rio’s behavior sooner than later.” </p><p>Lilia’s laugh was warm, “Yes, I didn’t think the scary bitch could get scarier. If looks could kill, Agatha– that kid gonna have the fiercest moms looking out for them.”</p><p>Agatha let her gaze drift back to the kitchen where her wife and Alice were talking as Rio cooked their dinner. Her wife was always her fierce protector, but now with their little one, she coudn’t help but wonder if Rio would go as far to beat up a kid if they dared tried to bully their own kid. She could see it, unfortunately. She turned back to Lilia, realizing she was speaking again. </p><p>“–I mean, there has to be so much to do, or did you and Rio already decorate?” </p><p>Agatha blinked, “Decorate what?” </p><p>Her friend chuckled, “Really, Harkness, pregnancy brain already?” </p><p>Agatha shook her head, her eyebrow raising, “That’s rich coming from you, Dory. I was just distracted. Decorate what?” </p><p>Lilia only shook her head as her eyes went down to where Agatha’s hand rested on her stomach, “The baby’s room, Agatha?”</p><p>“Oh, no, not yet. I think we are waiting for the eighteenth week scan. Rio and I have a bet placed on the gender–”</p><p>“Of course you two do,” Lilia rolled her eyes. </p><p>Agatha ignored her, “Rio has this hunch that our baby is a boy. Lilia, we have known for barely three weeks and that little shit already thinks she knows everything.” </p><p>“<em> Yo sí y esta pequeña mierda te trajo té, mi amor,” </em>a voice echoed behind her, lips pressing against her cheek before a green mug appeared in front of her.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes as she took the mug, staring at the purple heart on the mug’s side, the one that Rio had painted during one of their old pottery classes together years ago. Rio loved the mug since, barely allowing Agatha to use it. Her heart did a little flutter as she couldn’t stop the smile. </p><p>“And what do you think, Agatha?” Lilia asked the moment the footsteps faded behind her. </p><p>Agatha blew steadily on the hot drink, “What do you mean?” </p><p>Lilia sat forward, “I mean what do <em> you </em>think? Mothers– the pregnant one– usually have a sixth sense about their baby’s gender.” </p><p>She sat back for a moment, her hand back on her stomach. She tried feeling for it, thinking of a little girl inside her but all she could think of was Rio’s words– that she was going to have a boy. She set the hot mug down, shaking her head. </p><p>“I don’t know, Rio’s so damn adamant that I didn’t even think about it before she was pushing. She claims my hair is shinier and that is how she knows.”</p><p>Lilia laughed softly, sitting back, her eyes glinting at her, “Well, she does have a point and your skin is glowing. Divine Mother, Rio might be right for once.”  </p><p>Agatha scoffed, wrinkling her nose, “You’re just saying that because it’s me.”</p><p>Lilia held her chest in mock offense as their conversation turned more into the baby. Lilia practically grilled her on every detail from maternity leave for both her and Rio, to possible names, to themes of the baby’s room, to whether or not Agatha is breastfeeding (which she fully directed that question to another conversation), and even a baby shower. Most of the questions, Agatha hadn’t been able to answer. Rio and her had barely spoken in truth what the next steps were, they just settled that this baby– that their baby– was real. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay, so what’s the little one going to call you?” Alice walked in, holding a single plate of arroz con gandules. </p><p>Agatha felt her stomach rumble as her mouth watered. She loved Rio’s arroz con gandules. Alice handed her the plate and Agatha practically swiped it off of her, her fork digging into the rice as Alice laughed sitting beside her as she ate.</p><p>She swallowed her food before speaking, “Yeah, Rio will be <em> mami </em>and I will be mama.”</p><p>Alice smiled, “I should have known this kid is going to be bilingual.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and waited a second, wondering if her wife would chime in, but she found her presence wasn’t near. She sat up, turning to look towards the kitchen and finding movement before turning back to her coven. </p><p>“Yeah, Rio’s <em> abuelita </em>would throttle her if we didn’t.”</p><p>Alice sat up straighter as Agatha was already halfway through her dinner, “And what about Rio’s sisters? Do they know yet?” </p><p>Agatha felt herself tense at that. She knew very well how Rio felt about her older siblings, especially Maria. Agatha, surprisingly, got along with Oriana just fine, but Maria was another story. She was exactly like Rio, if not more stubborn and more callous. The only difference between the sisters was she was sure the oldest lacked common sense. When Rio and Agatha moved in together, it was the middle of their senior year fall semester. Rio wasn’t home, she was at a meeting to talk about her graduate classes and Agatha stayed in their home, preparing their dinner for their movie night when Maria had knocked. Agatha remembered opening the door, listening to the woman’s demands for Rio and Oriana standing sheepishly behind her. Agatha had no idea Rio even had siblings. Let’s just say, Agatha didn’t take too kindly to Maria and when Rio returned home, she watched as her girlfriend’s face had paled upon hearing her older sisters had found her. </p><p>Maria babied Rio, treated her like she was stupid, meanwhile she was the one who graduated from an Ivy League. Maria, in Maria’s opinion, always knew better than Rio, was always the right one, and was always supposed to be first. When Rio announced their engagement, Maria was pissed and jealous. Rio hated her for it, and almost didn’t invite Maria to the wedding. She <em> knew </em> Rio hadn’t told anyone in her family about their baby. Rio probably wouldn’t even tell them until their child was <em> at least </em> a year old, and even then, she was sure, Rio would hold out as long as possible. </p><p>“I think we all know the answer to that, Alice,” Agatha replied smoothly, her gaze going back to the kitchen where she heard no movement. </p><p>She strained her neck, listening for her wife’s footsteps, but she was only met with silence. Agatha didn’t like it. She couldn’t feel her wife’s presence in the house, and something slowly started to kick in. She wasn’t sure what it was as she felt like her breath was coming out shorter. Her mind entirely focused on her wife, her comforting coolness of her skin, her sweet pine scent, and Rio’s hand always on her, whether it was on her stomach, intertwining their fingers, or Rio playing with her hair. Now, she felt empty as the food became less interesting without her wife near. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Meanwhile, Rio dragged a basket and bags to their backyard, hurrying up the hill to the view of the trees as the moon started to rise. The sky was brighter here than the hill where she took Agatha away from Harvard on their first date. She could make out more constellations as the owls sang around her with the occasional flutter of a bat. The air was chilly, but they would be fine. She brought out more blankets this time, and knew her wife would be cuddled against her. She felt herself sigh, a warmth entering chest as her mind flashed back to the picture of the ultrasound. They were really doing this, and in a little over seven months, they would be moms. </p><p>Focusing back on the basket and bags in hand, she pulled out the blankets that she wrapped around her new telescope her wife bought her for Yule last year. They haven’t really used it together in a while and tonight would be perfect. She set it to the side, laying out the blankets and pillows. She reached back in, grabbing the fairy lights and lining the outsides of the picnic blanket before pulling out Agatha’s favorite snacks and tea in a thermos. Her phone buzzed in her pocket just as she rearranged the food. </p><p> </p><p><b>Alice : </b>Kola mode is going off. Get your ass back here before your pregnant wife starts tweaking</p><p> </p><p>Rio sighed, surveying her setup before switching the fairy lights on. She placed the bags in the basket before running back down the hill and into the house. She slipped back inside quietly and made her way behind her wife. Alice looked up at her, turning to Lilia and they both stood, making her wife sit up. </p><p>“Well, as much as we would love to torture you more with questions, your wife is kicking us out,” Alice smiled down at her. </p><p>Agatha turned and Rio watched as the tension left her shoulders the moment their eyes met. Alice was right. Agatha’s koala mode was going off again. When Lilia and Agatha were in the living room, she had told Alice about how strange and wonderful that her wife was being more clingy. Her best friend had laughed, comparing her wife to a koala, which Rio quickly denied, knowing Agatha would hate that, but now Rio saw it. When she moved around the couch to bid their friends goodbye, her wife was immediately leaning into her, forcing Alice to leave without a hug, and for once Rio was glad. Alice never left without hugging her, and most of the time, Rio hated it. She hated being touched in general, unless it was her wife (obviously). </p><p>The moment their door closed behind their friends, her wife turned to her, her arms crossing over her chest, “Where did <em> you </em>go? Why did you leave me to entertain all their questions? You realize Lilia asked me if I was breastfeeding!” </p><p>Rio smirked, staring at her wife lovingly, “Well, are you?” </p><p>Agatha smacked her arm, giving her a cold glare. </p><p>She laughed lightly, pulling her wife by her hips against her, “I am serious, <em> mi amor. </em>Are you going to?” </p><p>Her wife froze for a moment, seeming to figure out Rio being sincere in her question, “I don’t know. I didn’t think about it that far.” </p><p>Rio nodded, kissing her head, “You have time to decide, my love. Don’t worry, now as for where I was, how about I show you? Go put on your sweater.” </p><p>Agatha didn’t move, she simply reached forward, her hand fisting on Rio’s and tugging at it. Rio couldn’t stop her chuckle as she reached down and pulled herself from it to give it to her wife. She quickly grabbed another from their room before taking her wife’s hand and leading her out to the backyard. The moon was higher, shining down on them as the owls continued to coo. For a moment, Rio wondered if she was in some type of movie or a book with how the scene played out. The wind blew, but to her surprise it was warm, not overly chilling and she silently thanked whatever author was writing her story. Then, with her hand in her wife’s, she thought back to the baby, truly wondering what he would look like. In truth, she didn’t care whoever he looked like more, but as long as he was a blend of them both. One thing was for certain, she <em> knew </em>they were going to have a boy. She couldn’t shake the feeling, no matter how hard she tried. </p><p>They climbed the hill until the fairy lights were in view and her wife stopped, her hand tugging her to pause. She turned, looking to see how the moon lit up her features, her bright blues welling with tears as her hair blew around softly, framing her face. Agatha did look like she was in some type of movie and Rio the helpless audience as she stared at the scene, unable to take her eyes away from the beauty of it. She watched her wife take in the scene before finally looking at her, tears pouring down her face.</p><p>“I hate you,” she growled, but Rio could only laugh, tugging on her hand. </p><p>“Love you too, <em> cariño, </em>” Rio smirked, pulling her wife beside her and kissing her head.</p><p>Rio guided her wife to the blankets, getting her to sit down before crouching down and pouring the tea from the thermostat. She sat down next to her wife who immediately leaned against her, her head on her shoulder. Warmth encircled Rio as they took in the scene around them, watching a barn owl in the distance swoop down to catch a field mouse. With deliberate ease, Rio opened the few bags of chips and freeze-dried fruit, the strawberries mainly for herself. She wrapped her arm around her wife, reaching for the small telescope. </p><p>“Need another lesson in the stars, my love?” she teased as Agatha rolled eyes, but didn’t budge as Rio lifted the telescope. </p><p>Rio smiled softly, watching Agatha’s face light up even as she tried to act nonchalant. The night air was crisp, and the quiet of the hill wrapped around them like a comforting blanket, amplifying their small, peaceful moment. Rio’s fingers brushed over Agatha’s hair, still so soft despite the cool breeze. </p><p>“I know you love me, <em> cariño </em>,” Rio murmured, her voice a playful whisper against Agatha’s ear, knowing exactly how to get under her skin. “It’s written in the stars.” </p><p>Agatha smirked, pulling away slightly to give her a look of mock annoyance, but her eyes were warm and filled with affection. “You’re insufferable, you know that?” </p><p>“Only because you love me,” Rio teased, gently pulling Agatha closer again as she pointed the telescope towards the sky. </p><p>Her movements were deliberate, and she made sure to guide Agatha’s hand to steady it before letting her peer through the lens. The stars glittered in the sky, so many of them like scattered jewels, each one seeming to whisper secrets of the universe. </p><p>“See, there,” Rio said softly, her voice low and full of awe, “That’s Orion, and next to it... there’s the Pleiades, a cluster of stars you could almost touch if you could reach high enough.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes softened as she stared at the constellations, her breath coming out in little clouds in the cool night air. </p><p>“I don’t know how you do it, Rio,” she murmured, her voice barely a whisper. “You always make everything feel... magical.” </p><p>Rio’s smile softened, her heart swelling with love as she gazed at her wife, “Magic is real, Agatha. Just look at us.”</p><p>“You’re a fucking sap, have I mentioned that?” Agatha retorted, wrinkling her nose as Rio’s head fell back in laughter. “But, I guess you’re my sap. Tell me more about the stars.”</p><p>She smirked, taking the telescope and looking for the star-crossed lovers. Her movements were slow as she adjusted the lens and as she searched, she asked, “Have I ever told you about Vega and Altair?” </p><p>Agatha shook her head, a spark of curiosity sparking in her eyes. </p><p>Rio’s smirk softened as she found them, “The Japanese and Chinese versions are my favorite, and they’re similar, but I think I like the Japanese version a little more, although it’s more heart wrenching.”</p><p>She sat back, adjusting her position slightly to face Agatha, as if she were about to tell her a secret that had been passed down through generations. </p><p>“In Japan, the story of Vega and Altair is known as <em> Tanabata </em>, or the Star Festival. It’s based on the same myth of the Weaver Girl and the Cowherder from the Chinese version, but it carries a deeper connection to the harvest season, and the story is celebrated every year on the seventh day of the seventh month.”</p><p>Agatha’s interest deepened, her eyes fixed on Rio as she spoke. </p><p>“The Japanese version begins much like the Chinese one,” Rio continued. “Vega is Princess <em> Orihime </em> , the silk Princess, the daughter of the Emperor of the Heavens. She lived by a river in the sky and wove beautiful robes for the gods. But she was so dedicated to her work, she became lonely, and her father, seeing her sadness, arranged for her to meet a man named <em> Hikoboshi </em>, a handsome cow herder who lived on the opposite side of the Milky Way.” </p><p>Agatha’s brows furrowed slightly in thought, “They fall in love, right?” </p><p>“Yes,” Rio said, her voice softening. “Princess <em> Orihime </em> and <em> Hikoboshi </em> were so in love that they neglected their duties. <em> Orihime </em> stopped weaving, and <em> Hikoboshi </em> stopped tending to his cattle. The Emperor was furious when he saw their neglect and, in anger, separated them by the Milky Way, forbidding them to meet. The only way they could reunite was if they worked hard and showed their devotion. But the rule was that they could only meet once a year, on the seventh day of the seventh month.” </p><p>Agatha’s voice was full of sorrow, “That’s so cruel… to be so far apart.” </p><p>Rio nodded, her expression growing serious. “Yes, but here’s the part that makes it different from the Chinese version. In the Japanese version, the magpies form the bridge across the Milky Way, but there’s a twist. If it rains on <em> Tanabata </em> , the bridge disappears, and <em> Orihime </em> and <em> Hikoboshi </em> cannot meet. The magpies can’t fly through the rain, so they can’t form the bridge, and the lovers must remain apart for another year.” </p><p>Agatha looked up at the sky, her expression filled with the weight of the story, “So, every year, it depends on the weather if they can be together or not.” </p><p>“Exactly,” Rio said softly. “It’s a symbole of hope and longing. But it’s also about patience and love, you should know that ‘Miss English Major.’”</p><p>Agatha playfully pinched her. </p><p>“Hey,” Rio laughed before growing serious, her face falling into something solemn as she glanced up at the sky. “Sometimes, the universe makes us wait, and sometimes, the rain comes and we have to be apart. But when the sky is clear, and the magpies form the bridge, it’s like their love is shining brighter than ever.” </p><p>Agatha let out a soft breath, as if she were processing the bittersweet beauty of the story, “It’s a reminder that love doesn’t always work on our timeline. But when it does, it’s worth the wait.” </p><p>“Yes,” Rio agreed, her voice full of affection as she looked at Agatha. “Love, like the stars, can be distant, sometimes clouded by rain or obstacles. But it always finds a way back. And every time it shines, it’s even brighter than before.” </p><p>They both sat in silence for a moment, watching the stars, the gentle sound of the night filling the space between them. Rio’s hand found Agatha’s, and she squeezed it gently. </p><p>“We may not be separated by the Milky Way, <em> cariño </em>, but I think I understand what it’s like to wait for the perfect moment to be with someone. And when it happens... it’s like the whole universe aligns.” </p><p>Agatha leaned in closer, resting her head back on Rio’s shoulder. </p><p>“I think I’d wait forever for you, Rio,” she whispered. </p><p>Rio smiled softly, her heart full, “I’d wait for you too, Agatha. Every lifetime, if I had to.”</p><p> </p><p>For a moment they sat in silence, Rio’s thoughts on the story she told as her wife smiled into her, nuzzling against her as if breathing in her scent. Eventually, Rio guided them to lay down, pulling the blankets around them as her wife curled into her, pressing every part she could against her. Agatha’s head rested on her chest and Rio found herself playing with her hair as they gazed at the stars. Soon, Agatha prompted her to tell more stories of the stars. Rio knew how much Agatha loved her voice. She remembered on one of their dates, Agatha begged her to take her stargazing again. It was when they were first together and she remembered clearly telling Agatha about the star signs when she caught her staring at her. </p><p>“What?” Rio had paused in her story, glancing at her girlfriend. </p><p>Agatha had shaken her head, “I just– nothing. Continue the story.” </p><p>Rio had smirked, pulling her girlfriend to sit between her legs, having her back against her and Agatha’s head against her chest, “No, tell me.”</p><p>Agatha had hid her face, refusing. She smiled fondly, looking at how far her wife had come with her emotions and feeling safe, and Rio thanked the stars at how lucky Agatha had grown to feel safe enough to express them to her. It was torture in the beginning trying to figure out her partner’s emotions or at least get her tell her what was on her mind. </p><p>“Agatha,” she had drawn teasingly. “I won’t continue the story if you don’t tell me.” </p><p>Her girlfriend had grumbled before saying quietly, “I just like the sound of your voice.” </p><p>Rio smirked, but her heart melted as she leaned down, pressing a kiss to her girlfriend’s head, “Careful, beautiful, it almost sounds like you like me.” </p><p>She had groaned when she felt the elbow in her ribs, causing her girlfriend to chuckle, “Shut up and continue the story.” </p><p> </p><p>As the night trickled on, Rio’s leg had fallen asleep and the cold now had set in. Her wife was dozing in and out of sleep against her. Slowly, she nudged her awake and began packing up the food and blankets Agatha beside her before making their way back to the house. Rio set the bags aside before Agatha slipped her hand in hers and dragged her to their room. She laughed as her wife turned off the lights as they went. Instead of the bed, her wife took them in their bathroom. </p><p>Before Rio could open up her mouth, Agatha was already turning on the water, a sharp hiss echoed before the steady flow of water filled the room with steam. Her wife turned to her, a bright smirk in her eye as she lifted up the sweatshirt and shirt with it. Rio followed, her heart pounding as her wife stripped naked in front of her, revealing pale skin, glowing in the bathroom light. She paused, staring at her before her gaze lowered to her wife’s breasts. They looked a little bigger, her nipples standing up in the cold air as her wife smirked at her. Hands slipped around her waist before hooking into her sweat pants, and pushing them down along with her boxers. Agatha simply took her hand, leading her into the shower. </p><p>The moment Rio closed the door, she pounced, pressing her wife up against the black tile, her lips latching to hers. Agatha moaned into her mouth, her head tilting back slightly as Rio melted into her wife. Her body pressed against Agatha’s, feeling how well they fit, the water cascading over them. They tasted each other with fever, Rio’s hand making its way to the back of Agatha’s head, pushing through damp hair before playing with the baby hairs at the base of her neck. Rio slid her tongue along her wife’s tasting her, savoring her. It was slow and deep, each push and pull sparking something inside her. Her hands travelled down to her wife’s hips before getting her to spread her legs. She lifted her leg slightly, pressing into Agatha’s core already finding her wet even through the rain of water on her back. Agatha moaned softly, her hips rutting forward, spreading her arousal over Rio’s leg. It wasn’t enough to get her off, but enough to drive her wife crazy. </p><p>Her wife whined, a sweet note echoing in her ears when she pulled her leg away, but Rio wanted this slow. Everything in her craving to show her how much she loves her– her wife, the mother of her child. Her lips made their way to her neck, pressing soft kisses there, refusing to suck as Agatha swallowed hard, another whine being released. Rio held in her chuckle. Agatha would probably be mortified again how much a needy puddle she has made her, but Rio loved it. It sparked something else inside her as she kissed her wife’s collarbone, her tongue running over the expanse of delicious skin. She felt her wife’s hands on the backs of her shoulders, short nails scratching lightly until a hand tried running down her front. Rio stopped it, clicking her tongue. </p><p>“No, no, <em> mi amor. </em>Tonight is about you.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed at her, flicking hair from her face as Rio met those azure blues, “If tonight is about me, then I want you sitting on my face.”</p><p>Rio pretended like the statement didn’t just run straight to her core. Instead, she chuckled, leaning forward and kissing her wife’s neck up to her ear where her teeth pulled down gently. </p><p>“Uh-uh, that’s not how this works, my love. Tonight,” she paused, moving her lips to trial her neck again, listening to Agatha’s breath hitch. “I am going to worship the mother of my child.” </p><p>She trailed her kisses down around her throat and up to her lips, whispering softly in a tone that always made Agatha crumble. </p><p>“Tonight, you’re mine.” Rio whispered against Agatha’s skin, her voice a deep, intoxicating murmur that sent shivers down Agatha’s spine. </p><p>Her hands traced delicate patterns over Agatha’s back, every touch sending warmth flooding through her. Agatha gasped softly, her body responding to the possessive, tender care of her wife as Rio continued her slow, deliberate kisses. She leaned back, letting herself melt into the sensation, her fingers curling into Rio’s damp hair. </p><p>“Rio…” she breathed, her voice shaky as she struggled to hold onto her composure. Rio smiled against her skin, savoring the sound of Agatha’s voice– soft, breathless, completely undone. She nipped gently at the tender spot just below Agatha’s ear, enjoying the way Agatha’s breath hitched even more, before continuing her ministrations down the curve of her neck. </p><p>“I’ve been waiting for this,” Rio purred, her lips curling into a playful, seductive grin as she pulled away just enough to look into Agatha’s eyes. “For you to let go completely, to trust me with every piece of you. And tonight, <em> cariño </em>, I’m going to show you just how much you mean to me.” </p><p>Agatha’s breath came quicker as Rio’s lips found their way back to her throat, her body trembling with anticipation. Rio smirked knowing this was one of her last chances for a while to be able to do this to her wife. She pressed her body fully against her wife’s, pressing her to tiles as their lips met again, slowly and surely. Her hands wandered down her curves resting slightly on her stomach before caressing her ass and further down. Slowly, she lifted her wife up, Agatha only supported by Rio and the wall. Her wife gasped into the kiss and once more, whined when Rio pulled away. She gathered her strength, her muscles flexing as she knelt down, throwing her wife’s legs over her shoulders. She held her hips in place, balancing her wife there before she leaned forward, her tongue moving through wet silk folds. </p><p>“Divine Mother, Rio,” she heard her wife gasp. </p><p>Rio smirked into her, drowning herself in the taste of Agatha. She was like Rio’s own personal heroine, always coming to beg for more, and without the nasty side effects. Her tongue flicked through the slippery folding, barely able to find a grip to give her wife enough friction. Her wife moaned loudly above her, a hand coming down into Rio’s drenched locks as she feasted on her wife like a starved animal. Her tongue flicked, swirled, tasted and devoured her wife’s sweet pussy. She didn’t care as her arousal dripped down her chin, soaking her lips and up to her nose. She inhaled for a moment, still needing to breathe, but fuck the moment she smelled her wife this close, it made her mouth drool. She buried her face further into her wife, her lips splitting around Rio’s own lips. Her nose brushed her clit, her wife’s hips jutting forward at the brief contact. Rio pulled away slightly, looking up at her wife and fuck, the picture needed to hung up in the Louvre, well a private part of the Louvre only reserved for Rio. </p><p>Fuck Van Gogh. </p><p>Fuck the Greeks with their massive amount of statues in the one corner of the museum. </p><p>Agatha was breathing hard, her pupils blown, and her mouth opened with her panting. Droplets of water ran down her body, rolling over her breasts and dripping down towards where Rio knelt. For a moment, Rio considered standing back up and licking up the droplets of water, but her wife’s hips twitched, practically begging for more. </p><p>She kissed her thigh softly, “I won’t suffocate, <em> mi amor. </em>You can move your hips.” </p><p>Rio leaned back in, her tongue licking a long stripe up to her wife’s clit. The hand in her hair tightened, trying to bury her right back in between her wife’s legs. She smirked, listening as her mouth kissed, sucked, and licked. Her wife’s hips moved into her, her clit bumping Rio’s nose almost painfully, but fuck, she didn’t care. She shoved her tongue inside her, already feeling her wife squeezing around her, trying to somehow drag Rio’s tongue further inside her.</p><p>“Fuck, fuck,” her wife was panting and moaning above her. </p><p>She craned her neck up, trying to move slightly but her wife’s thighs were firmly locked around her head, trapping her in place. She tried anyhow, her eyes flicking up to catch the way her wife’s back arched, her head thrown back against the tiles, her long hair cascading over her breasts, and slightly bunching up around her bared neck as her one hand gripped onto the wall. She was a goddess, a goddess that Rio was happily worshipping on her knees. She barely felt the pain as they dug into the tile, all that mattered was the way her wife was thrashing above her and moaning so loud, she figured her neighbors most likely could hear her. She hummed, sending a small vibration into Agatha. Her wife looked down, meeting her eyes for a moment before her eyes closed, her mouth opening wide in a silent scream. </p><p>Rio held her tighter, keeping her body upright as it writhed against her. Her cum gushed into her mouth soaking the front of her face in more than just the water from the shower. She closed her eyes, licking slowly, seeking every last sweet drop. Agatha was sweeter to taste, filling her senses and thickly coating her tongue. Her wife tensed again, another small orgasm rippling through her as Rio’s tongue reached inside her, taking it all for herself. She didn’t pull away until she felt a hand caress the top of her head, a silent queue from her wife that she was overstimulated. </p><p>Before pulling away, she placed a soft kiss to her and watched as a string of cum connected to her lips and her wife before breaking, hanging off her chin. She ignored it for now, moving her wife’s thighs from her shoulders, but having them lock around her waist as she stood, staring at her wife. Agatha was a vision, panting heavily as her eyes stared at her, but she wasn’t really looking at Rio. She could see the happy haze in the blues as Rio slowly set her wife’s legs down. They shook underneath her and with a steady hand around her waist, she steadied her against the wall. Rio placed her head against her wife’s waiting for her to come down and for her legs to properly work again.</p><p>Agatha reached up, a single thumb brushing away at Rio’s chin before cupping her face tenderly. Rio stared, searching her eyes as she saw nothing but love. Agatha smiled at her, drawing their lips in a slow, delicate kiss. When they pulled away, Agatha was wiping more of herself off Rio’s cheeks, making her laugh softly. Her wife quirked a smile before placing a brief kiss on her nose. </p><p>“I love you, Rio,” she murmured, although her voice was hoarse. </p><p>Rio’s heart fluttered, hearing the raw tenderness her wife spoke, “I love you more, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>They showered after that, Rio running her hands through her wife’s thick chestnut mane, placing gentle kisses along her shoulders as she went. Her wife did the same, both of them taking in the quiet intimate moment of their shower. When they finally exited the shower, they moved to the bed, not caring if they soaked the sheets as their love making was slow. Rio poured her heart out, kissing along her lover’s body, whispering soft words to her as they moved in sync. It wasn’t rushed nor their normal fight of power. She fell into the feeling of being inside her wife, of her wife being inside her. Nothing could compare to this love as their bodies stayed flushed together, speaking the feelings Rio didn’t quite know how to say. </p><p>Rio pushed into her wife slowly with the strap, her lips never leaving hers as she slowly brought up her wife to that high, her name being cried out into the bedroom. Her hands moved up and down her wife’s curves, tracing every scar, every small divot, and perfect imperfection with the familiarity of someone who had memorized each detail. Rio surrendered completely to the sensation of being loved so wholly, pouring every part of herself into the quiet act of loving her wife in return, knowing they could lay there– she could lie with her and just forget the world.</p><p>In that moment, the outside world ceased to exist– their connection was all that mattered. Only the stars remained, faint pinpricks of light that seemed to pulse in rhythm with their heartbeats. From their celestial vantage, Vega and Altair, scattered across the Milky Way’s endless reach, gazed down with awe and longing, envious of the boundless love that connected the pair below. </p><p> </p><p align="center">

<h4>
<strong> <u> <em>Have you Heard What They’re Saying in the Halls ?</em> </u> </strong>
</h4><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>Wanda</b>
</p><p> </p><p>The professor sat hunched over her desk, staring at the screen blankly. She felt drained, her eyes drooping as the second hand ticked on in the corner of the room. Everything felt wrong, her whole body sagging as she rubbed her eyes, reaching for her cold coffee only for it to spill the moment she brought it to her lips. Groaning, she reached for the half empty tissue box, and for once she was glad she wore black instead of her usual reds. The weeks have passed in a blur together at this point as she moved in a haze, a third-scorned, a third-angered, and a third-hurt. She avoided Agatha like the plague, the Dean’s words ringing in her ears like a mantra. She cringed every time, fighting back a whimper like she was a kicked puppy in the streets. Then, came the bark of anger, her fists clenching anytime the scary bitch was near. She was humiliated, not only in front of the HR person, but then the department. They whispered about her as if she couldn’t hear them, staring at her as if she had a second head that looked as if it had been bashed in a couple times, just to add to the disgust she already felt. Everything in her wanted to get back at Vidal, but then came the scorn again, her own utter disgust with herself at how she acted, and finally just hurt. Agatha wouldn’t even look at her. </p><p>Which, fair, she admitted she deserved the silent treatment, but it still didn’t change how she felt. What twisted the knife deeper was the consistency of Vidal being in Poets’ Haven. The name itself was a complete joke. Poets’ Haven was anything but as Vidal pranced around as if she owned the place, and with Agatha Harkness beside her, but nothing flashed hotter than the hurt and anger from the rumors. They filled the halls, filled the quad, the student center, the classrooms, dining halls, the libraries and study lounges, and worse, even the departments. No one, from student to professor, could keep it out of their mouths. And worse, the more she listened, the more an obsessive hatred of the Dean took over. </p><p>It all started those weeks ago, the day when both Dr. Vidal and Dr. Harkness took off work on the same day and came in late the next. A student had seen them walking in the quad towards their buildings, sharing a few words before separating, but the student swore they saw them in the same car. And when she heard the rumor that spiralled from it, she laughed at first…</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Wanda sat in the teacher’s lounge, making her fourth cup of coffee of the day and it was only ten in the morning. She didn’t care, her nerves were shot anyway, her eyes red from the lack of sleep and she swore her eye bags had eye bags. She threw make up on the cover, but she knew her movements were sluggish, uncoordinated as she dropped her spoon, breaking the peaceful quietness of the lounge. She felt the eyes on her, and it took everything in her not to run away. She had grown used to it. In fact, she was sure the whole literature department and science department heard the moment she walked her path of shame back to Poets’ Haven after Mrs. Davis told her the next steps. She was on thin ice, and while she was technically allowed to interact with Dr. Harkness on matters of work, she was warned to limit it as much as necessary. To her luck, she hadn’t seen the woman since overhearing Dr. Vidal was pregnant– which meant one thing: Dr. Vidal was taken. Rio and Agatha were just friends and that if there was any possible way of becoming close with Agatha, then she wouldn’t have to worry about an overprotective scary ass spouse.  </em>
</p><p>(<b>author note: I am cackling. Denial is like her only friend right now) </b></p><p>
<em> Well, that was the thought until two professors came in, their conversation easily reaching her ears.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Do you hear what they are saying in the halls?” Dr. Crawdad drawled, coming beside Wanda as she grabbed a mug as well.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Dr. Lune joined her side, nodding, “The students are a nosy bunch this year. I never would have thought Harkness and Vidal would be this semester’s hot topic.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Crawdad turned to Lune, laughing slightly, “Oh, yes well it makes a little sense with them being the witches of their departments. You think they know what their students are saying?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Wanda felt herself twitch as she moved to sit at a table, next to an older gentleman who was the department head, “And what are the students saying? </em>
</p><p>
<em> Crawdad and Lune whipped towards him laughing, “You can’t say anything to either of them. I do not want to be the next victim of the Dean’s death stare.”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Lune nodded her head with her, “Please, that woman is scary enough as is.”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> The department head cocked his head, “Go on then, and no I won’t say anything. I believe the purple witch already has it out for me.”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> The room chuckled as Wanda’s grip on her mug tightened. She slouched down slightly, but no one acknowledged her. She was a mere shadow thanks to Dr. Vidal.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Lune giggled like a fucking school girl, making her head rattle. She squeezed her eyes tightly for a moment, still wondering why the hell Harkness and Vidal were on the student’s mouths. Then, as if on queue, Lune and Crawdad eyed her, but there was a glint of something dark– a malistic humor gleaming through their eyes that Wanda couldn’t miss.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “They say Dr. Vidal and Dr. Harkness are married.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> The room laughed, except for her… except for the head who only turned his head to the side. Wanda almost dropped her coffee, trying to look for a hint of a lie, but none of that came out, instead, the professors– the grown ass adults with years of schooling– started gossiping like their own students.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “No!”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Yes! I could see it too! Vidal never interacts with anyone willingly except for a few professors in the music department and Harkness.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Vidal even has a ring.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “So does Harkness. I spotted it the other day.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> ….. So does Harkness….  </em>
</p><p><em> Wanda held back her laughter now as she sat back, tuning out their chatter. A ring? No, Wanda made sure the moment she laid eyes on the woman to check if there was someone else in the picture. Plus, Agatha never said anything– she would say something if it were Vidal, right? How could another professor not say that their boss was also their wife? And Vidal? She didn’t strike Wanda as anything but straight, but in truth, she never had the best time telling. The more she thought about it though, the more she could see it. A woman like Vidal would never allow a man near her. Moreover, the rings that adorned her fingers, the constant blazers, the doc martens… goddess, she was an idiot– but not idiotic enough to believe Harkness and Vidal were married. She swallowed hard, trying to keep her face neutral, but it came heavy on her. If Vidal was pregnant, and they </em> <b> <em>were</em> </b> <em> married… then the child she carried was Agatha’s… but, even that sounded ridiculous.  </em></p><p>
<em> Before she could ponder more, the room went quiet, heels clicking into the space and Wanda didn’t need to look up to know who it was.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Harkness, you okay?”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> She peered up, watching the woman in purple turn on the kettle, “Fine, Crawdad, why?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Her voice was sharp, irritated as she reached up for her tea bag. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Crawdad took a step back as the room grew heavy, “Um, you just look a little tired.” </em>
</p><p><em> Agatha only hummed, reaching to grab the kettle that had finished boiling. Wanda watched her hand, her left hand that had something sparkling on it. She froze. Everything in her spinning as the emerald jewel caught the fluorescents and sparkled. There was a ring and it </em> <b> <em>was </em> </b> <em> on her left hand.  </em></p><p>
<em> “Hey, is that new?” Lune asked, and Wanda felt herself seethe.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> ‘Make yourself more obvious, why don’t you?’ she thought, bitterly as she reeled from what felt like a slap in the face.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Agatha looked up slowly before glancing back at the ring, “No.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “May I?” Lune reached out. She watched as the woman hesitated before extending her hand out to her. “Wow, it’s beautiful, Harkness. How come I didn’t see this sooner, and we started at the same time? How long have you been married?”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Agatha took her hand back, speaking slowly, “Um, I don’t always wear it, but um, it will be ten years in June.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Wanda set her mug down, pulling out her phone to just do something. Storming out would be dramatic, put too much attention on her, but to the gods she needed to get out of there. Agatha was married… has been for ten fucking years. She chewed the inside of her lip, her heart aching as it felt like she couldn’t breath. She had flirted with a married woman.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> She swallowed hard, trying to calm her breathing. It wasn’t that big of news, she could still be friends with the woman. It explained why she wasn’t interested in the first place. And was not like Agatha had said who her spouse was, but she would bet her own fucking life that it wasn’t Rio Vidal. </em>
</p><p><em> Her headache only got worse as </em> <b> <em>that</em> </b> <em> figure appeared, as if the mere thought of her could summon her. A knock echoed on the room before the professor stepped in, her cold, calculated gaze sweeping the room, luckily ignoring her as the head of the department nodded in greeting.  </em></p><p>
<em> “Good morning, everyone,” she said smoothly. “I see most of you are here. I wanted to announce at the end of finals week there will be a faculty mixer and the literature department will be in charge of it this semester. I trust the department head can choose the candidates who wish to be in charge of planning. I just require a draft to affirm any plans to stick to the budget. Thank you.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> With that Vidal turned on heel, barely sparing a glance at anyone as she walked out. Wanda watched Agatha, and to her pleasure, found the woman rolling her eyes. It was proof that Vidal and Harkness weren’t married to each other.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> The department head sat up, “Alright, who wants it?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Crawdad and I are in. Harkness, you care to join?”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Agatha rolled her eyes again, taking her mug and walking out the door, “No.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> Wanda sat up. She needed something to keep her sane at this point– something to spill the chaotic energy that engulfed her, “I will.”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Perfect, I’ll have Vidal send you three guides and a budget. She will share the rest of the details as well.”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>It had been going on for five fucking weeks, the rumor that Vidal and Harkness were married. Yet, she barely heard a peep from Vidal or Harkness from that matter. She wondered if they even knew. The students were terrified of them, especially Vidal, and so was she. Again, it was the end of the semester. Finals were about to move in full swing and Vidal still hated her. She joined the party planning, but every meeting, even with Gilliane Crawdad and Stephanie Lune by her side, she was shaking before the Dean. Her gaze was harsh, her words clipped with her, and most of her ideas were turned down, especially the assigned seating by department. Vidal had snapped at her; the whole point of the mixer was for the faculty to mingle among each other, not staying trapped in their retrospective departments. Vidal had eyed her like she could see straight through her. She wanted a chance to talk to Agatha again, and selfishly, she thought she could do it at the mixer. Wanda hated Vidal for seeing through it, and her hate only grew when Vidal mentioned being able to bring their plus one. She internally groaned, wondering who would be looped around Harkness’ arm that evening, and her jaw clenched at the thought of Vidal. </p><p>But Wanda tried to move on. She really did. It didn’t help that no one really talked to her in the department anymore, and the thought of trying to make friends with others at the party made her want to gag. But then there was Professor Vision. He was new, a strange man whose movements were more robot than human, but he was charming, sweet, and always searching for a way to make her laugh. And if he knew what happened between Wanda and Harkness, he must have not cared. He was a physics genius, somehow without a doctorate, and he was her date to the faculty mixer in two weeks. The last day of finals for the students, and her time to escape the rumors and whispers of Westview University for a month and a half. </p><p>The best part, aside from escaping the rumors, was escaping the Dean herself. She was fucking everywhere, as if the campus wasn’t big enough for the two of them. Wanda always caught her with Agatha. Hell, one evening, she went off campus to pick up her lunch and there Vidal and Harkness were, sitting at a booth, and looking over the menu. It was weird, to say the least. And strangely enough, she also couldn’t help but notice how fit the dean still was for being pregnant. She wondered if that day she decided to share it with Agatha was the moment she found it, so that meant Vidal would come back next semester with a baby bump and everyone else would find out… unless… </p><p>She cracked her neck, looking at the time as a dark smirk graced her lips. It was still early in the day and part of her should have thought of it sooner. If she could just add to the rumors, get under Vidal’s skin. It was petty, but it would be worth it, especially if Vidal’s exterior cracked. She just had to slip it to the right student– one who wouldn’t go crying to another professor and spill that it was her who started the new rumor that would eventually end up being true.  </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<b>Students </b>
</p><p> </p><p>Eva slammed her head down on the desk. It was their first finals week in two weeks and she felt dead already. Hell week, as they decided to call the week before finals, had taken it out of them and it hadn’t even started. She was surviving between late night Nando’s, Monsters, and the shitty vending machine coffee. Across from her, William and Ireland fell down on the couch, Ireland wiping at her tears as Eva sat up quickly, ignoring the protest in her back. </p><p>William raised a hand, stopping her from speaking as they both stared at Ireland. Her eyes were bloodshot, her frame shaking as she hiccuped for her breath. Ryan stepped into the circle, placing a bottle of water in front of their friend before sitting in the chair next to Eva. Ireland hiccuped again, taking the water and chugging it before looking at Eva. They eyes met, and Eva knew before it even came out of her mouth.</p><p>“Chad cheated on me,” her voice was a broken whisper, tears spilling down her cheeks again. </p><p>Eva moved, shooing William away and cradling her friend in her arms as she sobbed into her neck. She never liked Chad. He was the stereotypical frat fuck boy. She held her friend tighter, trying to help muffle her sobs. The friend group sat like that, in silence as Eva rubbed Ireland’s back, her hand moving in steady circles as Ryan left to get snacks and William stayed silently with them. Then, he cleared his throat, pulling out his laptop. </p><p>“Come on, Ireland,” he said carefully. “You have to pull yourself together. The first draft for Vidal’s is due in a few hours.” </p><p>“I don’t care,” she bit out, the tears burning her cheeks as her chest started to heave with anger. </p><p>Eva pulled away slightly, “Yes, you do. You are not failing a freshman biology class when it is your major and you are too smart to do so, <em> especially </em>not over crying for fucking Chad. He took enough from you. Don’t let that asshole take away your grades too.” </p><p>Eva and William locked eyes. Sure, it was cold, probably not what they should be focused on, but at this point, with Hell week on Monday and finals right after, they couldn’t do the stuff they wished to allow their friend to feel in peace. Her feelings had to come after, and it was then Eva and William were already planning a weekend trip for Ireland, but first they were going to make sure Ireland passed her exams with flying scores. </p><p>It caught her attention as she sat up, “You’re right. But, please not tonight. Give me tonight.” </p><p>William shook his head, “We can’t, not when Vidal’s first draft is due. You still have a bit to write.” </p><p>“Then, I will ask her for an extension,” she snapped, making the other two freeze and Ryan, who just came back from the vending machine, dropped his armful of snacks. </p><p>There was a beat of silence before Eva was pulling at Ireland’s face, expecting it, “Did you fall on your head too? Oh my gods, please tell me you didn’t just say what I think you said.” </p><p>William sat up, “Ireland, do you even hear yourself? Chad couldn’t have made you this stupid.”</p><p>Ryan was on the floor, picking up his candy and chips and setting them on the counter, “Yeah, and please don’t, especially not after what I just overheard by the vending machine.” </p><p>The group turned to look at him, even Ireland who was still tense in her anger, cocked her head for him to go on. </p><p>Ryan sat up, before looking around the study lounge warily. His voice dropped, low and urgent, his eyes never leaving the door. </p><p>“I overheard two professors and then some students whispering it. They say Vidal is pregnant.” </p><p>Eva, William, and Ireland all froze at once, their exhaustion momentarily forgotten and even the heartbreak from Ireland. For a long moment no one spoke as they all eyed each other. Ireland was the first to break out of the spell. </p><p>“Vidal?” she whispered, her voice hoarse. “Like Dr. Vidal– Dean Vidal– our science professor?” </p><p>Ryan nodded, his gaze darting around the lounge again, “Yeah, I didn’t catch much, but from what I heard, it’s a big deal. Some students were saying she has been acting differently, but the other professors? They sounded like they were even trying to be hushed about– like Vidal would swoop from the fucking shadows.” </p><p>Eva and William shared a glance, their brains still rattling through the exhaustion to figure out if this was true. Dr. Vidal– their terrifying, no-nonsense, private life biology professor– pregnant? On top of the rumors that they accidentally started that Dr. Harkness and her were married? To be fair, William still firmly believed that it was true. They had gone to the university faculty page and found both Vidal and Harkness had a masters from Harvard and a PhD from the world’s elite university, The Salemite’s University. It was near impossible to get into the PhD program there, even with masters from Harvard, and even with a masters from their own school. They barely accepted anyone, but Harkness and Vidal were the top professors here… and it seemed they must have known each since their master’s education. Friends were unlikely at this point. </p><p>“Maybe that’s why Dr. Harkness has been more of a bitch lately, stressed about her wife,” William noted. </p><p>Eva snorted, “Not this again. You really still think they are married?”</p><p>William threw his hands up, “Come on, Vidal is always with Harkness. I swear I have seen them in the same car, and let’s be real, Vidal only smiles while she is with Harkness. Plus, the rings, and they graduated from the same schools- plural might I emphasize.” He pointed his finger at Eva, his own teeth clenched, “<em> You </em> ’ <em> re </em>the one who told me to be delusional here, and the moment we find evidence now you’re telling me it’s too much?” </p><p>Eva shook her head, “Alright, you got me there, but Vidal being pregnant… that’s a terrifying thought.”</p><p>Ireland wiped at her cheeks, “And Harkness being a bitch because her wife is pregnant is proof enough?” </p><p>Ryan sat up, chocolate staining his lips, “Makes sense to me. Who wouldn’t be stressed if that woman is pregnant? Vidal is a nightmare on a good day. Imagine what happens when she is pregnant.” </p><p>They laughed slightly, even Ireland, although she still didn’t lose her tears. They went quiet, the rest of the group pulling out their laptops except for Ireland. </p><p>“So, what do we do with this information?” William finally spoke.</p><p>Eva shook her head, “Nothing. We are not getting on their radar.”</p><p>Then, Ireland sat up, grabbing her stuff and packing it away. </p><p>“What the hell are you doing?” Eva reached out, her face panicked as her friend wiped at her tears again. </p><p>“I am going to ask for an extension–” the group gasped. “If Vidal is pregnant, you know, more push of hormones, more emotional, then she developed a heart, and will actually grant me an extension for once.” </p><p>“Ireland. No.” </p><p>Ireland ignored her, already sitting up straighter, smoothing out her hoodie like she was preparing for battle. </p><p>William shook his head aggressively, “Oh my god, no. That’s not how this works. This is Vidal. She does not care about our suffering. Pregnant or not, she’d probably fail you harder just for asking.” </p><p>Ryan looked genuinely concerned, “Ireland, please. I’m begging you to let this go.” </p><p>But she was already grabbing her bag, slinging it on her shoulder, “No. This is the best chance I have. I need an extension. I’m going to ask.” </p><p>Eva physically grabbed her by the shoulders, “Have you lost your entire mind? Ireland, Vidal eats people alive for fun. You’re walking into a trap.” </p><p>Ireland shrugged her off, standing up with newfound resolve, “You guys are overreacting. If she’s pregnant, she’s probably softer now. Maybe she’ll actually care.” </p><p>Ryan groaned, rubbing his face, “We’re going to watch her die. She’s going to die in front of us.” </p><p>William flopped back onto the couch in defeat, “She was so young. So full of potential.” </p><p>Eva sighed heavily, pinching the bridge of her nose, “You better text us when you’re dead so we know how to divide your stuff.” </p><p>“I will be fine,” Ireland insisted, gathering her things and striding toward the door. The group watched in silent, horrified resignation as she left, marching toward certain doom. </p><p>Ryan exhaled slowly, “Should we… follow her?” </p><p>Eva shook her head, “No. She made her choice. Now we pray.”</p><p> </p><p>Ireland strided down the cool biology hallways, her tears were heavier though as she felt a few stares, but she had to do it. She needed tonight to process it. She blinked hard, choking back a sob that rose in her throat as she could still picture Chad moving over the girl. She had no idea who she was, but when she walked into his room, the girl and her locked eyes, and at first, she saw hostility, but as Chad threw himself off of her. He turned to Ireland to apologize, and a dawn of recognition came over the girl. The girl got dressed and walked out, leaving them yelling at each other and eventually, Ireland had walked up, running to find William, only to find the girl. She was shocked when the girl apologized and told her she deserved better. </p><p>It didn’t matter though, it still hurt and tonight, she just needed to drown her sorrows before locking in. Her friends were right. She wouldn’t let Chad get the upper hand by failing. She was better without Chad, but first, she needed to nurse her heart for tonight. </p><p>She froze when she stopped at Dr. Vidal’s door. She whipped at her eyes, smearing more of her mascara. It was pathetic, but she needed it. She needed the woman’s pity, whatever empathy the cold woman could give her. With a deep breath, she knocked and waited. She stood there for a moment more, before knocking again.</p><p>And finally, the cold voice echoed from the other side, “Come in.” </p><p>She walked in, finding the professor standing with her back turned. She was watering her plants, preening at the leaves before moving to the next, refusing to turn. She wore her usual attire, black pants and green blazer. Her hair pulled up into its signature claw clip. </p><p>“You have ten minutes for bothering me outside of office hours,” Vidal snapped, still watering her plants. </p><p>She stepped inside, closing the door behind her. It got the professor’s attention. Vidal turned slowly, crossing her arms as she sat back against her desk, looking at her curiously and staring at her face with a raised eyebrow. </p><p>“Miss McGrath,” the professor hesitated for a moment. “Is there something that you need?” </p><p><em> Oh shit, so she does know my name, </em>she panicked. </p><p>She took a deep breath, staring into the eyes of the beast, “Professor, I– I need to ask for an extension on the draft.”</p><p>She watched as her sharp brown eyes flicked up, pinning Ireland in place like a bug under a microscope. </p><p> “An extension?” she repeated, as if the very word offended her. </p><p>Ireland nodded, her throat tightening. She hadn’t actually planned on crying in front of Dr. Vidal, but the stress, exhaustion, and heartbreak all crashed down on her at once.</p><p>“I—” her voice broke. “Chad cheated on me.” </p><p>Dr. Vidal blinked slowly, “Excuse me?” </p><p>Ireland wiped at her face furiously, “Chad. My boyfriend– I mean my ex-boyfriend. He cheated on me. I just found out, and I can’t focus, and I just need a little more time to finish my draft. Please.” </p><p>She expected a lot of reactions from Vidal– impatience, annoyance, maybe even outright rejection– but what she wasn’t prepared for was the sheer shock on her professor’s face. Dr. Vidal stared at her like she had just announced she was a time traveler. </p><p>“Are you…” her tongue pushed at the inside of cheek for a moment. “Are you crying?” </p><p>Ireland sniffled, “Yes?” </p><p>Vidal looked deeply, profoundly uncomfortable. She stood up, walking behind her desk as she played with her ring, seeming to want to create distance. Slowly, she sat down, staring at Ireland like she was dealing with a wild animal rather than a practical normal human capable of feelings. </p><p>“You are… crying in my office.” </p><p>Ireland felt her eyes widened before they twitched with annoyance and her jaw clenched. She couldn’t keep the tears from flowing as she snapped. </p><p>“I just said that.” </p><p>Dr. Vidal leaned back in her chair, her expression unreadable, “…why?” </p><p>Ireland gawked at her, her frustration melting over. Dr. Vidal was a doctor, an esteemed professor in sciences and here she was questioning her on why she was crying. There wasn’t a single amount of warmth and it was then Ireland realized her mistake, but there was no changing it. Her heart ached in the worst possible way and she couldn’t stop herself from yelling at the professor. </p><p>“Because Chad cheated on me!” </p><p>Vidal blinked again, not even phased from her outburst. </p><p>Then she tilted her head slightly, “I don’t know who <em> that </em> is.” </p><p>Ireland groaned, throwing her hands up as she began pacing before her, “He’s– ugh, it doesn’t matter! The point is, I’m an emotional wreck, and I just need a few extra days on the draft. Please.”</p><p>Vidal was still watching her like she was a bizarre specimen under study, “…You are requesting an <em> extension </em> because you are emotional?” </p><p>Ireland froze, “…Yes?” </p><p>A long, excruciating silence followed. </p><p>Then, Vidal let out a slow, careful breath and reached for her pen, “No.” </p><p>Ireland felt her stomach drop as she whipped around the face of the Dean head on, “<em> What? </em>” </p><p>“No,” Vidal’s tone was flat, matter-of-fact, as if the very concept of an extension was an alien language. “Your deadline remains the same.” </p><p>Ireland stared at her for a beat. Her mouth opened in protest but only hot tears came. Her fists clenched as a sob left her mouth for a moment, but Vidal merely turned her attention to the papers on her desk, picking up a pen as seeming to forget Ireland standing there. </p><p>“You-you can’t be-be serious.” </p><p>Vidal nodded, her pen scratching away on the paper, “Deadly.” </p><p>And that was it.</p><p>The dam broke. </p><p>Ireland let out a sharp, frustrated scream, dropping her bag onto the floor with a thud. Her body moved before she could think, pacing frantically in the small office, her movements erratic and wild. Her heart was pounding so loudly she could barely hear herself over it, but the words kept coming, faster than she could stop them.</p><p>“You can’t be– this isn’t just a little bit emotional! I woke up this morning thinking everything was fine! I was ready to turn in the draft tonight! This class– this stupid <em> fucking </em> class– has been one of the best I’ve ever taken, but of course it had to be <em> you </em> teaching it!” </p><p>Vidal had stopped writing. Her fingers had gone still, the pen slipping from her hand as she stared at Ireland, her sharp, icy composure fracturing into something that almost looked like shock. </p><p>Ireland didn’t care. </p><p>“This day was supposed to be easy before you and all the other professors decided to torture us and act like we’re just fucking machines! But no!” she let out a bitter laugh, her voice raw and hysterical. “Because I went to Chad’s, and I found him in bed <em> with someone else </em> ! <em> Someone else </em>! And I thought– I foolishly fucking thought– that he loved me!” </p><p>Her breath came in short, sharp gasps. </p><p>“And then– then!– when I thought, for one second, that I had even the smallest bit of hope, because you’re pregnant– that maybe you’d have a fucking ounce of empathy– ” </p><p><em> Shit, shit, please just strike me dead, </em>the bucket of water hit Ireland as she froze, the words dying on her lips. </p><p>Silence filled the room, pure deafening silence as she peaked a gaze at the professor. Vidal’s expression shifted entirely. Gone was the indifference, the boredom, the unimpressed glare. Instead, she looked more than just stunned– she looked like she just swallowed the red pill and was now in the matrix. For the first time, Ireland saw Dr. Rio Vidal genuinely caught off guard. </p><p>And then, after a long, agonizing beat– “<em> What </em>?” </p><p>Her voice was different now. Lower. Sharper. Ireland’s rage sputtered slightly, her chest still heaving, but something about the way Vidal said it made her suddenly, acutely aware of the fact that she had just made a very serious mistake. Vidal blinked once, then leaned forward slightly, her piercing brown eyes narrowing. </p><p>“Say that again.” </p><p>Ireland swallowed, throat dry, “You’re pregnant?” </p><p>Another long pause. </p><p>Then– Vidal laughed. </p><p>It wasn’t a happy laugh. It wasn’t even amused. It was sharp, cold, and furious. </p><p>“Oh,” Vidal said, pressing her hands flat against the desk as she pushed herself up to stand. “Oh, you’ve got to be kidding me.” </p><p>Ireland took an instinctive step back. </p><p>Vidal was pissed. </p><p>“You came into my office, crying over some pathetic little boy, demanding an extension because of a rumor?” Vidal’s voice was deadly quiet, but it burned with fury. </p><p>Ireland opened her mouth, but nothing came out. Vidal let out a sharp, humorless breath, running a hand down her face before muttering something rapid and low in Spanish. Then, she turned back to Ireland, her glare scorching. </p><p>“Get. Out.” </p><p> </p><p>
<b>Rio </b>
</p><p> </p><p>The moment the door slammed shut, Rio slouched, burying her face into her hands. She stared at the desk in between the crack of her fingers as hot frustrated tears began to well up. Today was already long enough. She had a series of meetings, dealing with incompetent idiots. She couldn’t even have lunch with her wife who was more than irritated by it, but luckily didn’t start a fight, and the rumors– the fucking <em> rumors. </em> Her and Agatha’s names were everywhere. The whispers instantly that they were married. It made her skin crawl with every turn in the hall, fuck, even in the professor’s lounge they whispered. No one had the fucking balls to just ask. No, instead it was rampant all over the halls, the classrooms, <em> her </em>labs– the rumors had taken over Westview University. And worse, it literally started the day after her and Agatha came back to work after her wife’s six week ultrasound. </p><p>Rio was losing her goddamn mind, her mind circling from the rumors that seemed to undermine her every move, the lingering stares at her, and worse– the possibility of it stressing her wife out. She briefly wondered if this was her fault. Maybe, she should have said she was married from the beginning. Sure, her workers might have thought of the unfair advantage of her wife, maybe undermined her position in faculty meetings, or maybe the people who hated her, would also hate Agatha and vice versa– it would have been better than being left to gossip. Rio buried her face further in her hands. This wasn’t supposed to go this way. Who knew that wanting a little privacy would be this much of a fucking pain? And worse, maybe if Rio was just transparent in the beginning, Maximoff would have never flirted. </p><p>This was all her fault. </p><p>But, life wasn’t finished with her– no, it wanted her horizontal, in a grave, because the words from the student who had the audacity to <em> sob </em> to her, just felt compelled to do it, because of the new rumor: she was pregnant… Rio saw red, grabbing the closest thing– a pen– and hurling it across the room. </p><p>
<em> Where the hell did they even get that from?  </em>
</p><p>She swallowed hard as a wave of self-consciousness passed through her. She looked down at her stomach, pulling her shirt back, but her own abs just greeted her. She knew she was being silly with that idea. She worked out almost every day, well sure she had been slacking since her koala bear of a wife decided she was her tree to cling on, but even then, <em> her </em> appearance hadn’t changed. Her wife was faintly showing, nothing major. It was like someone was pushing out their stomach and this time, it wasn’t bloating, it was <em> their </em>baby, making himself known. It was easy to hide, her wife wearing loose sweaters, some cardigans to pull over her body, even a crew-neck hid her belly, but it was there and oh, how Rio adored it.</p><p>Her gaze shifted to the ultrasound that sat proudly on her desk in a frame. She usually put the frame away during office hours, but it always came back out when it was just her time. In between grading, and even Zoom meeting, she found herself staring at the image, and in one week, her <em> pequeño extraterrestre </em> would finally look like a baby. Luckily, it was on the weekend, learning their lesson that they really couldn’t take the day off together. But at this point, Rio was wondering if it even mattered anymore. The rumor was there, running rampant like a wildfire through the halls of the university. If they could have just kept it, if Rio would have kept her fucking cool or if Stark could have just handled Wanda, then her and her wife could live their life peacefully, and the moment they left for maternity, they wouldn’t have to hear the rumors, the whispers aboutthem , or the stares like she was animal in a zoo… but no… none of that happened as she had planned, and Rio couldn’t shake that it was all her fault. It was <em> her </em>fault for the stress that she ultimately subjected her wife to, even though she tried her damn hardest to protect her. </p><p>Rio had failed. </p><p>Rio Vidal, the protector of her family, had failed, before she could even begin to have that family. The moment her wife had unveiled the positive pregnancy test, she vowed she would protect them: both their physical healths– to her wife’s mental health. She would never tell her wife, but she spent hours researching everything and anything. She poured over articles on symptoms, what to do when they hit, foods her wife could eat, to the vitamins and creams she would need, how the baby would grow inside her, the mental health aspects her wife would face, to what it mean to breastfeed or use a formula, the birthing process– even home birth if they couldn’t make it the hospital in time– anything she could do to make her sure wife would be safe, loved, and as comfortable as possible. Stress wasn’t good for her wife or for the baby, and she already failed at protecting her from that simple factor. </p><p>Tears slipped from their hold as she sucked in her breath. If she couldn’t protect her wife from something so simple as stress from rumors, then how the fuck was she supposed to protect her own child? And with that thought, she crumbled. Rio placed her arms into her desk, muffling her soft sobs. What broke her further was that she couldn’t even go to her wife. It would go against everything that she had tried to do. <em> She </em> was supposed to be the strong one, and she wouldn’t let her wife see her crying over more rumors. The rumors that she was pregnant. </p><p>Rio sat up, letting out a low confused laugh. Then, her tears died and her eyes darkened. Whoever started the rumor will wish they hadn’t even breathed life. She felt her eyelid twitch, something dark twisting within her. Whoever started the rumor, spread it among the students, and probably the faculty– oh, she would make their life not even worth living. Murder was off the table for legal reasons– but she would enjoy slicing their neck open in a different way. </p><p>

<b>Jennifer</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Jennifer sat back in the lounge, her head reeling as she nursed her coffee. Everywhere she went, all she heard was Rio’s and Agatha’s names between faculty and students alike, and it drove her crazy, especially knowing the truth. From what she knew, the pair had finally started wearing their rings, and Alice and Lilia were right– the rumors were all over the university that they were married– true as they might be, but fuck it was annoying. She might have not liked Agatha, but she was annoyed for her. But then, the new rumor was unearthed, and it spread faster than anything she had ever heard.</p><p>As if on queue her phone buzzed:</p><hr/><p><b>My Light 🧡: </b>Babe, have you heard the rumors ? </p><p> </p><p align="right">As if I could unhear them. <b>:Me</b></p><p align="right">How the hell did this even start?

She froze for a moment, listening to her impending doom. </p><p>“I am <em> not </em> pregnant. Do you even hear yourself? Stop wasting my time and <em> yours </em>by listening to these rumors!” </p><p>The door to the lounge opened, slamming behind the Dean as she stomped in, going to the printer that began running. Jen turned slowly, swallowing her nerves as she followed Rio’s stiff movements. Her fingers tapped impatiently against the heavy machine, her neck even twitching as Jen could see the scowl from her side profile. </p><p>“Long day?” she spoke softly. </p><p>Dark eyes whipped towards her, “Don’t even start, Kale.” </p><p>She flinched, watching the usual professional demeanor crack upon the woman. </p><p>“I wasn’t, Vidal, but you are one more <em> ‘congratulations’ </em> from killing someone and you and I both know that won’t look good for your image.” </p><p>Rio didn’t respond, she simply turned, grabbing her papers, “Not here, Jennifer. Please.”</p><p>Jen stood up straight, following the Dean down the hall. She watched as the students gawked, their mouths open as their eyes went to Rio’s stomach. She understood. She too would be just as furious if someone started a rumor she was pregnant when she wasn’t. It felt more than just invasive and worse, it was almost embarrassing, but from Rio, she could tell the woman was frustrated and tired, especially with how much she wanted her private life respected. </p><p>The moment they walked into Rio’s office, they sat down, Rio reaching for a picture frame and turning around. Jen froze, staring at the white shape among the shadows. It wasn’t a full baby, but she studied with a midwife once upon a time. The baby in the image she guessed was six weeks old, its form still taking shape. With a deep breath, she collected herself and turned back to Rio. </p><p>“I’ll start with this, so you don’t kill me. How far along is your wife?” </p><p>Rio stared at her for a moment, her gaze intense before it dawned on her, “Alice told you, figures. She’s eleven weeks along now. We have the twelve week scan next weekend.”</p><p>“Congratulations, Rio, seriously,” she said, keeping her voice earnest. </p><p>Rio only nodded, taking the frame and smiling softly down at it. Jen stared, having only seen something similar from the cold witch across from her when the woman looked at her wife. It was a rare moment, one reserved for those she loved and something grew in Jen for Rio, something that was a little bit more than respect– more like understanding. Rio was just a woman protecting her family. </p><p>“Is there anything that I can do?” she said slowly. “I know Alice and I bullied you two for the rings but it only seems to have brought you more trouble.” </p><p>Rio took a deep breath, her eyebrows pinched together, “Just, if you or anyone could find who started the rumor and also dissuade it. I don’t need it to stress my wife out.”</p><p>Jen nodded, sitting up, “Of course, and look, I am not Alice, but if you need anyone to talk to that isn’t your wife, I am here. You have a lot going on, try not to keep it all in. You don’t always have to be the strong one, even with your wife being pregnant. I admire your love for her, but even you have to realize, this isn’t in your control. You are only human.”</p><p>Rio snorted her laughter, sitting back in her chair, “Alice sent you.”</p><p>“Yeah, and she told me to remind you that you <em> are </em>human. People are cruel, they were going to talk, whether you and Agatha were out before or later.” </p><p>Rio sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose, “I know. I know that, Kale.” </p><p>Jen studied her, noting the dark circles under her eyes, the tension in her shoulders. She had seen Rio furious before– had even been on the receiving end of it more than once– but this wasn’t just anger. This was exhaustion. </p><p>“You don’t look like you’ve been sleeping.” </p><p>Rio let out a dry laugh, “No, really? What gave it away?” </p><p>Jen rolled her eyes, “I’m being serious.” </p><p>Rio exhaled sharply, setting the ultrasound frame down. She traced a finger along its edge, her expression softening just slightly. </p><p>“Just worried for her. Who knew people could get obsessed with people who are basically strangers?”</p><p>Jen shook her head, “It’s more than that, Rio. You know it.”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth for a moment, then closed it, sitting back against her chair with a defeated sigh. </p><p>“Look, I get it– you’re used to handling things on your own. But this is different. This is big. You’re gonna be a mom, and that means you don’t have to shoulder everything alone.” </p><p>Rio exhaled through her nose again, rubbing at her temple, “I just… I want to make things easier for Agatha. She’s already dealing with enough between her classes, the pregnancy, and–” she gestured vaguely, “ –<em> this </em> bullshit.” </p><p>Jen nodded, understanding, “And who’s making things easier for you?” </p><p>Rio blinked. </p><p>“You’re running yourself into the ground, Rio,” Jen continued. “That’s not gonna help Agatha. It’s not gonna help the baby. And it sure as hell isn’t gonna help you.” </p><p>Rio looked down at the ultrasound again, her fingers tightening around the frame, “…I just want them to be okay.” </p><p>“They will be,” Jen said firmly. “But only if you stop pretending you don’t need help.” </p><p>Rio huffed, “You and Alice really are insufferable.”</p><p>Jen smirked, “Yeah, well, someone has to make sure you don’t implode.” </p><p>Rio let out a slow breath, then leaned back in her chair, looking at Jen with something almost like gratitude, “Thanks, Kale.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<b>Rio </b>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio returned home late that evening. It was almost nine when she opened the door, kicking off her heels and throwing her coat on the hook before making her way into the kitchen. She threw her keys on the counter before finding food left for her in the fridge, dinner her wife saved for her. She had meetings that ran late, some with students, but mostly faculty. She hated it. All she wanted to do was to go home, lock herself in her greenhouse and fucking breathe. Worse, she knew she wasn’t in the mood to be touched and her wife, ever the koala bear… well, she hated the idea of her own needs getting in the way of her pregnant wife’s. Normally, Agatha never complained if Rio didn’t want to be touched. There were just moments where Rio felt trapped by the idea of someone touching her. It was overwhelming, too human. </p><p>She had always been like this, where some days she couldn’t be touched at all. Her siblings were never physically affectionate and what she could remember of her parents, neither were they. Her <em> abuelita </em>was a different story, but she adored her. Sex was fine– great even… all before Agatha. With Agatha, she barely felt like this. She had her days, sure, and her wife was ever attentive, knew and never pushed or was offended. Agatha would just be there for Rio in other ways, making her meals, picking her up coffee or flowers, or allowing Rio to rant on whatever topic she wanted to talk about, even if they both knew Agatha had no idea what she was talking about. But most days, she craved her wife’s touch and it wasn’t just about sex. She craved the way her wife would cradle her face, hold her at night or allow Rio to hold her. The lingering touches on her shoulders, on her back, on her arm– it was their love language and fuck she loved it…. but she didn’t deserve that now… not when she was failing her own wife.</p><p>Rio swallowed the roast thickly before shoving it back in the fridge and making her way into the living room. It was quiet except for the faint hum of music from the television. She looked up, smiling as she saw <em> Sailor Song </em> playing. It was <em> their </em>song. One of many as her wife was playing their shared playlist full of all the songs that reminded them of each other. She smiled softly looking over the couch and finding her wife half-awake as she crocheted a green and purple blanket. </p><p>“Good evening, my love,” Agatha smiled up at her, setting the needle and blanket down. </p><p>Rio smiled faintly, her gaze going to her wife’s stomach. Her wife just wore shorts and her sports bra, leaving her belly open for her to see. She reached down, hesitantly, her hand shaking slightly, placing it on her wife’s growing bump, but she remained quiet, unsure how to tell her wife she needed a moment. </p><p>“Long day?” </p><p>She nodded, “Yeah, too long, <em> cariño. </em>” </p><p>Her wife nodded, but kept staring up at her expectantly, but Rio couldn’t. Something gnawed at her and she felt restless. She removed her hand, ready to walk away but her wife’s hand caught her. She tensed, feeling the warmth there, but didn’t she pull away like she usually did. She let herself freeze, meeting the confused blues.</p><p>“Come cuddle with me, my love?” her wife asked softly. </p><p>Rio swallowed thickly, her eyes darting around for a moment before leaning down, and kissing her wife’s head to make sure she knew how much Rio loved her, “Later, <em> cariño </em>. I am going to go run. I’ll join you in bed after.” </p><p>Agatha nodded, but she saw something in her eyes, but Rio recognized it wasn’t in the way Agatha usually looked at her. It seemed clouded, for once uncertain and almost like she was scared. It reminded her the first time Rio did this dance with her when they were dating, but then, Agatha was more patient and not clouded by how unbalanced her hormones were now. Rio hesitated, then leaned down again, brushing her lips softly over Agatha’s. Her wife hummed in response, her free hand ghosting over Rio’s cheek before pulling away, letting her go. </p><p>“Don’t be long,” she said softly. </p><p>Rio chuckled, “I’ll try not to be.”</p><p>She turned to their room, changing into shorts and her own sports bra before making her way to the basement where a makeshift cave was set up. It was large with a big couch in the center, a bar against the wall and a pool table to the side along with an actual table. A larger TV was across from the couch and in the back was Rio’s gym supplies. She climbed up onto the treadmill, throwing on her headphones. </p><p> </p><p>Rio ran.</p><p>The treadmill hummed beneath her as she pounded against it, her breath steady, her pulse thrumming. It wasn’t enough– not yet. The frustration still clung to her skin, a weight she couldn’t shake. So she pushed herself harder, ran until her lungs burned and her legs ached, until all she could focus on was the rhythmic slap of her feet over the music against the belt. </p><p> </p><p>She didn’t know how long she had been down there when she finally slowed to a stop. Sweat dripped down from her forehead as she braced herself against the treadmill’s rails, catching her breath. Her legs quivered, her bad knee aching in protest at what she had done and she silently cursed herself for tearing her ACL all those years ago. The pain always ghosted over her, haunting her on random days and most of the time when she ran. She stood there for a moment, staring at the blank wall in front of her, before exhaling sharply and heading upstairs to shower. </p><p>The hot water helped. Some of the tension melted from her muscles, but not enough. By the time she stepped out, dressed in sweatpants and a tank top, her body felt lighter, but her mind still churned. She just needed to eat, cool down, and then she’d crawl into bed next to her wife. Things would be fine. </p><p>She limped slightly into the kitchen, opening the fridge and grabbing the plate of food Agatha had set aside for her. As she sat down at the counter, light footsteps padded up behind her and Rio had to fight herself from tensing. She turned though, staring at the soft curve of her wife’s growing belly. The sight made something in Rio soften, but she was too tired, too restless, to fully give in to the warmth curling in her chest. Agatha stepped up behind her, hands gentle as they brushed over Rio’s shoulders, but Rio flinched. Just slightly. But it was enough. Agatha’s hands recoiled like she had been burned. Rio winced as she heard her wife’s sharp inhale.</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha said. </p><p>Just that. One syllable, quiet and fragile, like a thread stretched too thin. Rio turned, guilt clawing its way up her throat. </p><p>“<em> Cariño </em>, it’s not–” </p><p>“No, it’s fine,” Agatha cut in, stepping back, arms crossing over her chest like she was holding herself together. </p><p>Her blue eyes– so full of warmth, of love, of everything that made Rio feel safe– were suddenly distant. Guarded. And then, Agatha smiled. It was a small, tight thing. Wrong. A shield. A defense. </p><p>“I mean, I’ve just been carrying your child for eleven weeks,” she said, her voice light– too light. “But yeah. You can’t even <em> handle </em> me touching you.”</p><p> Rio’s stomach twisted, her hands curling into fists. “That’s not fair–” </p><p>“Not fair?” Agatha laughed, but there was nothing real about it. Just sharp edges and broken glass. “I haven’t seen you all day. I didn’t even get to have lunch with you. And then you come home, you don’t even <em>look</em> at me, and when I try to touch you, you flinch like I’m a <em>fucking</em> <em>stranger</em>.” </p><p>Her voice cracked, just slightly, but Rio heard it. Felt it like a knife to the gut. </p><p>“I <em>get</em> it, Rio,” Agatha continued, her arms tightening around herself. “I <em>get</em> that you don’t always like to be touched. I <em>know</em> that. But you <em>flinching</em> <em>away</em> <em>from</em> <em>me</em>?” her breath hitched, her eyes shining in the dim light. “That hurts.”</p><p> Rio gritted her teeth, fighting the storm rising inside her. </p><p>“I didn’t do it on purpose,” she said, her voice low, strained. </p><p>Agatha scoffed, shaking her head, “Doesn’t make it hurt any less.” </p><p>Rio exhaled sharply, her body aching with frustration. </p><p>“I <em> love </em> you, Agatha,” she said, the words raw, desperate. “I love you <em> more </em> than anything. But some days, I just–” she swallowed hard. “I just <em> can’t </em>.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flashed, “Can’t what? Can’t let your <em> wife </em> touch you?” </p><p>Rio grit her teeth, “That’s not what I mean. I just need some time to–” </p><p>“Well, take all the fucking time you need,” Agatha snapped. </p><p>Before Rio could say anything else, Agatha stormed past her, heading straight for their bedroom. </p><p>“Agatha–” </p><p>She moved to follow, but her leg buckled, a sharp jolt of pain tearing through her muscles. She caught herself on the counter, gritting her teeth, pushing forward– too slow. She watched as her wife slipped into their bedroom, the door slamming shut in her face. Rio sucked in a sharp breath, her entire body growing rigid. </p><p>Then came the lock. </p><p>
<em> Click.  </em>
</p><p>A sound so small, so simple, but it echoed in the house like a gunshot, aiming straight for Rio’s already bleeding heart. And then, from the other side of the door, muffled but cutting, came Agatha’s voice.</p><p>“Sleep on the fucking couch.”</p>

<b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
<span>She stared at the door, breath shallow, hands clenched at her side. She could hear Agatha moving inside– shuffling, the rustle of blankets, the sharp intake of breath that meant she was crying but trying not to. Rio wanted to fight. Wanted to completely blow the door off its hinges, fall to her knees, and beg Agatha to hear her…to explain, to fix it. But what was there to fix? She had failed her, and worse she had hurt her wife– her pregnant, exhausted wife. The woman she had promised to cherish, to love, to protect– the woman Rio’s black heart beat for. And instead– Rio pressed a trembling hand to her forehead, inhaling shakenly before leaning against the door for a moment. She knew Agatha heard her by the way she had gone still, not a sound behind the door now. With an unsteady exhale, she pulled away. Agatha told her to sleep on the couch. So she would. Even if it felt like a death sentence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her body was pure weight as she moved down the hall, each step protesting under her as she turned off the lights in a broken haze. When she fell to the couch, she found it uncomfortable, but it didn’t matter, because Rio deserved it. She failed. She hurt her… how the fuck was she supposed to be a good mother? With that, she curled into herself, hoping to block the weight in her chest, but it didn’t stop. She turned, grabbing a pillow and burying her face into it, trying– failing– to stop the tears burning at her eyes. She never cried, not like this. This was a different pain, something she never felt before. Her shoulders shook, her breath hiccuping in sharp, uneven gasps, as she sobbed into the pillow like it was the only thing keeping her together. She could still hear Agatha’s voice in her head. The way it had wavered. The way she had pulled away. The way she had looked at Rio like she didn’t recognize her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And it was all her fault. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pushed away the only person in the world she cared about, the only person in the whole universe that she loved. Agatha was Rio’s everything. She was the earth, sun, sea, and stars. She would do anything for her, to the gods, she loved that woman so much it was painful. Agatha was the first person to understand her– if not the only person. Sure, she had her friends and Oriana was the closer sister, but no one compared to Agatha. She swore the woman knew her better than she knew herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio clawed at herself, hating that she hurt her, hating at who she was. If only she could have been stronger, to be able to suck it up, and would have just held her damn wife like she requested. She was carrying her child and Divine Mother– Rio couldn’t breathe. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She sat up, cradling her knees to her chest, the pillow now tucked between her knees and chest as she screamed her sobs into it. She couldn’t shake the hurricane of thoughts, the way her own mind felt like a hive of angry wasps, stinging their own home, and leaving nothing but hurt. She was going to fail as a mother. This child– gods, this child was going to hate her. She wasn’t enough for either of them. She choked again, clawing for breath, but refusing to lift her head from the pillow. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hands shook, desperately clutching the pillow tighter as if it could somehow tether her to reality. Every thought felt like a dagger to her heart– sharp and relentless. The stinging, overwhelming guilt refused to leave. Her wife just needed her, Agatha who hated being vulnerable, who hated voicing what she needed, voiced what she needed and Rio just pushed her away. She wasn’t the rock she promised to be, she wasn’t the partner her wife deserved. She thought of their first date, how Agatha had made her feel seen, feel whole. The quiet moments between them, when the world seemed to fade away, leaving just the two of them in a safe, perfect bubble. Rio couldn’t remember a time when Agatha wasn’t in her heart, so deep it was embedded in her very soul. The idea of losing her– of failing her– was unbearable. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She squeezed her eyes shut, trying to block out the image of Agatha’s face, how her wife had pulled back, as if she had been burned by Rio’s touch. Every word Agatha had spoken in that fragile, broken voice echoed in Rio’s mind, cutting deeper with each replay. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Why couldn’t I just be here for her? </span>
</em>
<span>she wondered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The answer was simple. She wasn’t enough. Not strong enough, not kind enough, not patient enough. She had always been one to keep her walls, to shut people out– worse than her wife. She learned to turn off her emotions, to just be something powerful, void of emotion… fuck, she had even shut Agatha out at times before. She had learned to survive by shutting off parts of herself, to keep people at arms length– cause in the end, they would just leave whether it was the road to death or just not being able to understand her… but she never realized the damage that would cause to the one that mattered most. Agatha had always given, always trusted her, and she had repaid that by being distant when her wife needed her warmth the most. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her chest ached, a deep, raw ache she had no words for, but the pain of it was consuming. Rio wrapped her arms around herself tighter, desperate for comfort that wasn’t coming. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She </span>
<em>
<span>ruined</span>
</em>
<span> everything. </span>
</p><p>
<span>All in one day, the universe stopped working around her. A single frayed thread… it was pulled and her natural order of life dismantled. Her vision blurred as her body fell back against the couch, and she just stared up at the ceiling. She couldn’t sleep. She couldn’t stop crying. There was no escaping the overwelcoming, crushing guilt. It was a nightmare with no end, just endless spirals, each one pulling her deeper into darkness. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio drifted in and out of consciousness, never fully sleeping, never fully awake. She listened to her pounding heart in her head as the tension wouldn’t leave her. Everything was fuzzy as she imagined it all differently. If she and her wife would have just packed their shit and move to buck-fuck nowhere Alaska, or somewhere in French Alpes maybe the Swiss, or even somewhere deep in the German Black Forest. The Black Forest sounded nice. A cottage in the middle of trees, nature, and something deeply connected to the green. No noisy students. No fucking Wanda Maximoff. No immature colleagues. Just her, her wife, and their child. And she would be there for both of them, protect them, and love them like they deserved. She half wondered if in another life her and her wife had done just that. She couldn’t imagine a timeline in the multiverse where she wouldn’t be with her wife. And as she told her wife before, she would wait a thousand years, and love her for all to come. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She drifted into the dream a little further, something to soothe ache and guilt, but it only twisted the knife deeper. She saw her wife in a simple purple dress, running in a meadow with a smaller figure with dark brown hair, darker than Agatha’s but lighter than her black hair. She saw herself explaining how rivers worked, what different trees and plants were before laying in the same meadow at night with both of them in her arms as she told stories of the stars.</span>
</p><p>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>The breath left her body. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes flew open as she slowly registered something just collided into her, pinning her deeper into cushions of the couch. She was frozen, disoriented as the weight had punched the air from her lungs. It was warm though, gentle and rough all at once. Fingers clawed at her chest as it fought to fuse with her body. Then, a familiar scent surrounded her: lavender, cinnamon, and something that was distinctly her wife as the weight trembled on her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She blinked, wondering if it was just her desperate mind trying to fill in the absence of her wife, but as her head cleared she felt it against her neck. The breath was hot, blowing out raggedly, sending chills through her. Then there was something wet, a damp heat soaking her skin on her neck and running down to her chest. Her mind stuttered, trying to catch up– her hearing finally coming back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A soft sobbed echoed against her, breaking the silence of the house. It gripped her down to her very bones, as if hands had wrapped around her bones, pulling out her skeleton form, a form that wouldn’t change– a strange sense of begging, longing, praying that Rio wouldn’t disappear. Her mind was still catching up, trying to pull out of her own spiral, but her body worked. Her arms moved without thought, pulling the body closer to her, but a loud wail was the final punch that got her to regain her senses. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>This was real. </span>
</p><p>
<span>This wasn’t a dream. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha. </span>
<em>
<span>Crying.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife was here against her chest, sobbing loudly and clutching onto her as if she were to let go, Rio would disappear. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s entire world tilted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shut up,” Agatha growled, but her voice was thick and broken. She clung to Rio with trembling fingers, burrowing into her, pressing herself as close as possible. “Just– shut up and hold me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio obeyed, her arms wrapping tighter around her wife, tucking her face underneath her chin. Agatha continued her sobs, burrowing her face into Rio’s neck as Rio ran her fingers through her wife’s hair, a gesture that always calmed her. Within minutes, her wife’s breathing was steading. The violent sobs fell into something that was fragmented, a few hiccups and her breathing staccato. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She still refused to let go, the tears back in her eyes, but it wasn’t out of complete guilt, there was a small relief that her wife was here. Her Agatha was holding onto her like a lifeline. She was here in Rio’s arms where she belonged. Her wife nuzzled closer as Rio pressed a gentle kiss to her temple, knowing no words in Spanish or English could erase the pain she caused her wife. So she did what she knew would speak her apologies: gentle kisses, her hands gently caressing the curve of her stomach, and Agatha’s favorite of Rio running her fingers through her hair. She didn’t move, not until Agatha’s breaths grew into gentle sighs and her neck was only left sticky from her dried tears. The moment a soft pair of lips were placed underneath her jaw, Rio shifted. She pulled Agatha closer, moving her where her arm supported underneath her knees, the other cradling her back. Her wife moved instinctively, wrapping her arms around her neck as she stood, wincing slightly at the way her legs ached from her run previously. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio moved easily around the couch and down the hall where their door was once locked by a gunshot to her heart. Her wife pressed another kiss lazily to her jaw again as she nudged the door open with her foot. Crossing the threshold, she placed her wife down slowly into bed on her side, a silent way of telling her wife she wasn’t leaving her. Agatha moved to her side, opening the quilts to Rio who climbed in beside. Before she could even settle, Agatha’s arms were around her, her face pressing into the crease of Rio’s neck and shoulder. A small smile graced her lips as she settled them back in their bed, holding her pregnant wife as close as possible as she trembled.</span>

<span>“Te amo, cariño,” </span>
</em>
<span>her voice whispered softly against her wife’s head. </span>
<em>
<span>“</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>Lo siento</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>.”</span>
</em>
</p><p><span>Her wife only shook her head, against her, “Shh, </span><em><span>lo sé.</span></em> <em><span>Te amo más. Simplemente no lo sueltes.</span></em><span>” (I know. I love you more. Just don’t let go.)</span></p><p>
<span>With that, her wife fell into a deep slumber, her breathing fully steady, taking in Rio’s scent. She stayed up a little more, making sure her wife was asleep, her hand reaching under the blankets to her wife’s stomach once more. And it was like that, Rio fell asleep, finally with her wife in her arms, refusing to let go, even in her slumber. </span>
</p><p><br/>

</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Agatha </b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked against the heaviness in her eyelids, disoriented as she tried to make sense of her surroundings. She couldn’t quite place where her pillow had gone. The comforting scent of pine and cedar wood, which had wrapped around her like a blanket as she fell asleep, had faded into a faint trace. Her hand reached out instinctively, seeking the warmth she was used to. Her body ached from the remnants of the sobs that had wracked her the night before, and for a moment, her eyelashes resisted the urge to open. She kept them shut, brow furrowed, only to be met with the cold emptiness of the sheets beside her.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh that little bitch–</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could finish the thought, before the anger and hurt drowned her again, she felt a warm hand against her bare skin. All the animosity died from the featherlight touch on her stomach. Then it came more firmly, a thumb brushing over in a deliberate pattern. She almost shivered, her body warming at the sensation but what truly made her freeze was the press of lips against her belly. Soft. Reverent. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then a whisper. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was low, and heavy, Rio’s voice still deep with sleep, but nonetheless loving, “</span>
<em>
<span>Mi pequeño… mi amor más puro…</span>
</em>
<span>” (My little one… my purest love…)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha held her breath. Rio’s voice was hushed, filled with something she rarely let slip, something raw and unguarded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>No sé si puedes escucharme todavía, pero quiero que sepas cuánto te amo.</span>
</em>
<span>” (I don’t know if you can hear me yet, but I want you to know how much I love you.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another kiss, lingering, as if Rio wanted to pour all her devotion into it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Desde el momento en que supe que existías, todo en mi mundo cambió. No sé qué tan bueno seré en esto, pero te prometo esto: siempre estaré aquí para ti.</span>
</em>
<span>” (From the moment I knew you existed, everything in my world changed. I don’t know how good I’ll be at this, but I will promise you this: I will always be here for you.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her throat tighten. Rio’s fingers traced a slow, swirling pattern just beneath her navel, her voice dipping even softer. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Cuando des tus primeros pasos, yo estaré allí. Cuando caigas, te atraparé. Cuando tengas miedo, te abrazaré hasta que el miedo desaparezca.</span>
</em>
<span>” (When you take your first steps, I will be there. When you fall, I’ll catch you. When you are afraid, I will hug you until the fear goes away.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her lips brushed over Agatha’s skin again, warm and gentle. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Tu mamá dice que soy insoportable. Que soy terca, que nunca sé cuándo rendirme… y tienes razón, mi amor. Pero eso significa que nunca dejaré de luchar por ti.</span>
</em>
<span>” (Your mama says I’m unbearable. That I am stubborn, that I never know when to give up... and you are right, my love. But that means I will never stop fighting for you.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>A small chuckle. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Aunque sé que probablemente heredes mi terquedad y la vuelvas loca. Harás travesuras, la desafiarás, la pondrás de los nervios. Y ella fingirá que le molesta, pero la verdad es que le encantará.</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
<span>(Although I know you’ll probably inherit my stubbornness and drive her crazy. You will make mischief, you will challenge her, you will get on her nerves. And she will pretend that it bothers her, but the truth is that she will love it.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers ghosted over Agatha’s stomach, a little more firm but still tender before she pressed one more kiss there. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Siempre serás amado. Siempre serás protegido. Mientras tenga aliento en mis pulmones, nadie te tocará. Eres mi vida, mi alma, mi promesa eterna.</span>
</em>
<span>” (You will always be loved. You will always be protected. As long as I have breath in my lungs, no one will touch you. You are my life, my soul, my eternal promise.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart clenched, as she drew her lip in a thin line, scared to ruin the moment. She felt Rio exhale against her skin, as if grounding herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Te amo, mi pequeño. Te amo más de lo que las palabras pueden decir.</span>
</em>
<span>” (I love you, my little one. I love you more than words can say.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t stop the tears that pricked at her eyes, her chest tightening with something overwhelming. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She swallowed, her voice barely above a whisper, “</span>
<em>
<span>Y ellos te amarán a ti.” </span>
</em>
<span>(And they will love you.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stilled, her eyes widening as she sat up, seeming to want to pull away from her. Agatha didn’t let her. She grabbed her wife’s hand, keeping it firmly against her stomach, staring up into her eyes, watching in stunned silence as water began to fall from them. Agatha sat up, opening her arms to her wife. Out of all the reactions… out of all the scenarios in the morning, she didn’t expect to find her wife talking to her stomach on the verge of tears, like there was a fear Rio wasn’t yet ready to share. Rio rarely cried, even when their fights left Rio burned and beaten to the ground. This was new. This was strange. For a moment, Agatha wondered if they swapped bodies like </span>
<em>
<span>Freaky Friday </span>
</em>
<span>and she was actually Rio, her own emotional ass trapped inside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife trembled in her arms, sobbing into her own neck, a mirror of last night and Agatha immediately felt a wave of guilt wash over. She should have given her wife some space and she knew her wife would come and talk when she was ready. But she couldn’t stop herself in the moment, everything in her seeking the comfort of her wife’s strong arms. Part of her wondered if it was her fault, if she put too much pressure on her and Rio thought she had to play the strong protective role, shielding Agatha away from anything that caused even the tiniest bit of stress. Agatha kissed her head repeatedly, allowing her wife to cry it out, before Rio took a deep shuddering breath. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Lo siento</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>, mi amor,</span>
</em>
<span>” Rio’s voice was hoarse, tugging at Agatha’s heart. “I shouldn’t have pushed you away last night– I-I never wanted to hurt you–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, holding her wife tighter, pressing her face into her soft hair. Gods, Agatha hated talking. They both did. Touch was easier, each kiss being able to heal everything they sucked at putting into words. Make-up sex was easy. They would fight, both of them say nasty things to each other before one of them dragged the other into a harsh kiss when there was nothing left to say and hurt would flash in their eyes. Speaking with their tongues made sense, especially to Agatha. She would explore Rio’s body all over again, pouring her love and apologies with every touch, every caress, every lingering kiss– until they crashed into a high together and the cycle would repeat until they were spent, one of them whispering how much they loved the other. Agatha could do that. </span>
<em>
<span>This</span>
</em>
<span> made her want to pull away, but she knew she couldn’t. Rio and her agreed years ago to stop running and fix anything they fought about as soon as they calmed down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> was also different. Rio was </span>
<em>
<span>crying. </span>
</em>
<span>The strongest person she knew was crying. Rio didn’t even cry when she tore her ACL, and although Rio bragged about not crying, Agatha was sure it was just her body going into shock. But this time, she knew that for once, their love language wasn’t going to be the answer… especially after last night when Rio flinched from her. She internally cringed, the hurt flashing all over again, even though she knew her wife. It was a moment where Rio was carrying something that she wasn’t telling Agatha… but somehow that made it hurt more. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sniffled, her breath coming out in shaky, uneven bursts. Agatha could feel it against her collarbone, the way her wife was trying so damn hard to hold herself together, but the cracks were there– splintering, breaking, widening until there was nothing left to do but fall. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t have to– ” Agatha started, but Rio tensed in her arms, cutting her off. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do,” Rio’s voice was barely above a whisper, but the weight of it crushed Agatha’s chest. “I should’ve– I shouldn’t have shut you out.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed, tightening her arms around her, “Then why did you?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Silence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could feel the hesitation in the way Rio’s fingers curled against her back, clenching the fabric of her bra as if she was afraid Agatha would pull away. She willed herself to stay. They couldn’t keep running. It couldn’t just be one of them saving the other. They had to save each other, but in the moment, she knew Rio needed extra strength, not because she was weak, but because she was too stubborn to admit she had taken on more than could carry. So she waited. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a slow, trembling breath. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t want to stress you out,” her voice cracked at the end, and Agatha shut her eyes against the sharp sting in her own chest. “You’re pregnant, Agatha. And you– fuck, you already have so much on your plate, I just– I thought I could handle it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach twisted, a slow, creeping ache unfurling in her ribs. She had guessed correctly. Her wife was being her stubborn self. She pulled back just enough to see Rio’s face, and it nearly shattered her. Her wife’s eyes were red-rimmed, glassy with unshed tears, her lips pressed together in a wobbly, miserable line. She looked exhausted. She looked </span>
<em>
<span>small</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“My love,” Agatha whispered, reaching up to cradle her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head, blinking rapidly, like she could force herself to keep it together if she just didn’t </span>
<em>
<span>look</span>
</em>
<span> at her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t want to break down in front of you,” she admitted, the words spilling out in a rush, like she had been holding them back for too long. “I didn’t want you to see me like that especially over just these fucking rumors. I wanted to be strong for you. But I– ” her voice cracked, and this time, she didn’t try to swallow it down. “I ended up pushing you away instead. And I hate myself for that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt something in her chest </span>
<em>
<span>snap</span>
</em>
<span>. She didn’t think. Didn’t hesitate. She just </span>
<em>
<span>kissed</span>
</em>
<span> her– her lips caressing Rio’s as soft as a flower’s petal, and her hands framing Rio’s face as if she could siphon all the guilt away with the very press of her lips. Rio made a noise, something so soft… something so broken. Then, slowly she melted into the kiss, pressing her own lips softly against Agatha’s. It wasn’t the normal take, the fast pace they usually did. This was something perfectly new. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha finally pulled back, she rested her forehead against Rio’s, their breaths mingling in the small space between them. She took in the familiar scent of her, morning breath and all, and part of her wanted to chuckle at it– how some mornings the other kicked the other out to brush their teeth before falling back into bed. She didn’t care this time, happily being close with her wife, but she knew Rio needed more than just a simple kiss. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She remembered the one sided conversation, how scared Rio seemed, how she acted if she was failing both her and their unborn child. Rio could never fail in her eyes, and it scared her to think Rio ever thought that. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then don’t shut me out next time,” her voice softened. “Let me carry it with you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out something between a laugh and a sigh, her breath tickling Agatha’s skin, “You are already carrying enough, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled back slightly, just enough to cup Rio’s face in her hands. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are part of what I carry, my love,” she traced a thumb over Rio’s cheek, catching the last remnants of her tears. “Not just in the sense that I </span>
<em>
<span>am</span>
</em>
<span> physically carrying a part of you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She earned a weak smile, a hand back on her stomach. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“But because I love you. Because I am your wife. Our wedding vows, my love, we promised to carry each other, not one of us just bearing all the weight.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed hard, her eyes flickering with something unreadable. But it was something like vulnerability, love, and perhaps, need. She turned her face slightly, just enough to press a soft kiss to Agatha’s palm. That small gesture made Agatha’s breath catch. She had touched Rio a thousand times before– brushed their fingers together absentmindedly, pulled her in by the waist, tangled their limbs together under the covers– but there was something different about this. Maybe it was the way Rio’s lips lingered on her skin, how her hands slid tentatively up Agatha’s sides, hesitant but wanting. Maybe it was the way their foreheads pressed together, how their breathing had synced without them realizing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head, brushing the tip of her nose against Rio’s, her fingers sliding down to curl around the back of her neck. Rio’s breath hitched. It wasn’t meant to be anything at first– just a soft kiss, slow and lingering… reassurance– comfort. But the moment their lips met, something shifted. Rio let out a quiet, shuddering sigh against her mouth, her fingers tightening in the fabric of Agatha’s bra. The small noise sent heat curling low in Agatha’s stomach. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They weren’t fixing things with rushed, desperate touches this time. No dragging each other into a heated, messy kiss to erase whatever had hurt them. This was different, softer, deeper. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pressed another kiss to Rio’s lips, slower this time, savoring the way her wife melted into her. She felt Rio’s hands slide up to her shoulders, pulling her closer, her body fitting perfectly against Agatha’s own. The warmth between them grew, humming under their skin, igniting in the spaces where their bodies touched. Rio was the one who deepened the kiss first, tilting her head to slot their mouths together more firmly. It was still slow, but now there was something else– something heavier, something that made Agatha’s fingers dig into Rio’s back, made her part her lips just enough to let Rio take whatever she needed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha finally pulled back, Rio chased after her, pressing a feather-light kiss to the corner of her mouth, then her jaw, then lower. A silent plea. Their eyes locked, speaking to each other with a language only they knew. They leaned in again, this kiss hot and wanting. Agatha sighed into it. This is what they knew. This was for her, for her Rio, and for their relationship. This was easier than talking. </span>
</p><p>
<span>This was them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt Rio’s lips move, trailing down her jaw and up to her ear. Her lips brushed against her neck, warm and purposeful, her breath still uneven from crying. She sighed softly, tilting her head, giving her wife more room to take whatever she needed. Rio started slowly, her mouth tracing a path down Agatha’s pulse, her hands sliding around the curve of her stomach, fingertips ghosting over bare skin. There was no rush, no frantic desperation– just quiet, lingering touches that spoke in the language they understood best. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love you,” Rio murmured, her voice still hoarse, but steady now. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled softly, threading her fingers through Rio’s hair, “I know.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She kissed the top of her head, then tugged her back up, capturing her lips again, slower, deeper, letting the heat simmer between them. Rio melted into her, pressing closer, her hands gripping Agatha’s hips like she was grounding herself. But when Agatha ran her hands down Rio’s back, tracing the curve of her spine, she felt the smallest shiver. She pulled back just enough to look her in the eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come here,” she whispered, tugging Rio to lay back down with her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio followed without hesitation, their bodies lining together without struggle. Her wife let her guide her, her gaze dark and unsure, but filled with something achingly tender. The moment they slotted their bodies together, Agatha rolled them over, pinning Rio beneath her. But, she didn’t move right away. She just looked at her, really </span>
<em>
<span>looked</span>
</em>
<span> at her. Her eyes studied the flush in her cheeks, the way Rio’s lips were slightly parted, her breath uneven that was no longer from her previous crying. Rio, her rock, her strong, stubbornly independent, unshakeable Rio, was now soft, open beneath her. Rio was trusting her to hold her– finally letting go, finally allowing Agatha to take care of her after months of Rio only taking care of Agatha, and refusing the care in turn. And gods, Agatha would take care of her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She leaned down, her hair creating a chestnut curtain around them as she kissed her, slower this time, dragging her lips over Rio’s with a deliberate patience. Her hands moved along Rio’s bare skin, her fingers rippling with the divents of ribs beneath her touch. Her fingers moved, going down the delicately carved rolling hills of abs, but she could feel the tension still coiled there, the weight she had been carrying alone for too long. She reached up, slipping beneath the fabric of Rio’s bra. She pushed it up inch by inch, revealing beautiful caramel skin as her wife sat up with her, her arms raising to allow Agatha to slide the garment off. She threw it somewhere behind her, pushing Rio back into the mattress, her lips trailing along sharp collarbones, up her neck, and to her lips once more. Rio sighed into her mouth, arching into her touch, her fingers curling into Agatha’s shorts in silent plea. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mm-mm,” Agatha murmured against her lips, pulling away just enough to meet her gaze. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She ran her fingers gently over Rio’s stomach again, moving over her rib cage and whispering, “Let me take care of you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath hitched, something raw flashing in her eyes before she nodded, exhaling shakily. Agatha didn’t make her wait. She kissed down the column of Rio’s throat, slow and unhurried, her hands continuing their exploration, tracing every inch of familiar skin, relearning all the places that made her wife tremble. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha trailed open-mouthed kisses down Rio’s body, letting her lips and tongue map out every inch of beloved skin. She traced her collarbones, licking at the damp skin back by the base of her neck before moving down. Her lips found the slow rises of her breasts, kissing and sucking at the soft skin. Her tongue dragged over her heart, kissing just where it was beating below before wrapping her mouth around a pert nipple. She felt the way Rio trembled beneath her, how her breath caught in her throat, how her fingers curled into the sheets as if anchoring herself. She had always loved this– </span>
<em>
<span>worshiping</span>
</em>
<span> her, peeling her apart slowly, unraveling her layer by layer until there was nothing left but gasped breaths and whispered pleas. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s skin was warm beneath her lips, her stomach rising and falling unevenly as Agatha traced slow, teasing patterns along her ribs, her hips, the soft plane of her stomach. Her lips continued their slow sucks, marking the skin around it before dragging her lips over to the other, sucking softly and kissing the skin tenderly. Her wife shuddered for a moment as Agatha dragged her tongue down her body, following the path of where her hands were. One hand braced herself above her, the other tapped her thigh, requesting her to move. Rio’s legs parted just enough for Agatha to settle between, her hand coming back up to trace her wife’s torso. She paused just on her stomach for a moment, feeling the careful rise and fall of her breath before shifting herself lower. She kissed the curve of her waist, her grip tightening where she held her in place. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Agatha</span>
</em>
<span>,” Rio breathed, her voice wrecked with need. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed against her skin, pressing a lingering kiss just above her navel, “Patience, sweetheart.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a shaky laugh, but it broke into a sigh when Agatha dipped lower, teasing her lips along the inside of her thigh, feeling the muscles tense beneath her mouth. She didn’t rush though. She savored every reaction– every soft moan, every sharp inhale, every way Rio’s body responded to her touch. She reached up, placing a leg upon her shoulder, her wife following with the other as she continued her assault down Rio’s inner thighs. She licked and nipped, teasing the sweet honey already running from her. Finally, she gave in, the deep musky scent of Rio entrancing her forward. Her lips brushed her slowly, a ghost of a kiss on her glistening folds. Her wife jerked, her thighs tightening for a moment before relaxing. Her tongue came out, dragging up, and this time she didn’t tease her, her tongue pressing harder against that rosy bud. A gasp left Rio’s lips, fingers threading into Agatha’s hair. Rio didn’t pull her though, just keeping a hand there to steady herself before Agatha moved forward again, shoving her tongue between her folds, swallowing the sweet nectar. She moved a hand around her thigh, placing a small amount of pressure below Rio’s navel holding her in place as she placed hot, longing, open mouth kisses on her, sucking slightly on a fold before her tongue ran through again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha explored like it was the first time all over; listening, adjusting, her mouth learning her wife again until Rio was trembling beneath her. She pressed deeper, her name falling from Rio’s lips in a breathless moan, her thighs tightening around her shoulders. Agatha let herself drown in her– Rio’s taste, her scent, the heat of her skin, the way she gasped when Agatha’s tongue moved just right. Rio’s grip tightened, her breath growing uneven, her body strung tight. She smirked, her free hand moving up and spreading her wife open. She pushed her tongue inside her, feeling her writhe as she licked faster, moving her tongue in and out as Rio’s walls tried grasping at her, begging her to go deeper. Agatha turned back to her clit, enveloping her lips around it and retrieving a long moan and a sharp tug to her hair. She smiled, her tongue soothing the suck before moving it without pattern, drawing out each needy whine, each sudden gasp, and each breathless moan. Agatha knew her wife, knew exactly when she was close, knew how to push her just </span>
<em>
<span>a little</span>
</em>
<span> further, so she returned to her clit, sucking harder. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha-” Rio’s voice broke, her hips shifting restlessly beneath her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let go,” Agatha murmured against her, voice thick with devotion. “I’ve got you, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio did. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her body lifted up into Agatha’s mouth, her hips rocking forward as the hand left her hair to tear at the sheets, clawing at them like they were the only thing tethering her to the world. A shuddering, loud cry escaped Rio’s lips as her pleasure crashed over her in waves. Agatha didn’t let up, her tongue lapping greedily as Rio’s cum washed into her mouth, tasting the way her wife fell apart beneath her. She drank it all, refusing to pull away until she had her fill of every desperate sound, every pulse, every tremor. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio finally stilled, Agatha placed one last kiss there, Rio jolting from oversensitivity, but melting as Agatha licked around her thighs, cleaning the arousal and cum off of them before kissing her way along her thighs, having them fall off her shoulders. She trailed her kisses up Rio’s stomach, between her breasts, crawling over her until their bodies aligned.  She cupped Rio’s face gently, feeling the flush of her skin beneath her hands. Rio’s eyes were closed, her lips swollen, breathing hard, yet she still reached for Agatha with trembling fingers, pulling her back into a kiss– soft, slow, and full of all the love she had yet to say.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha beat her wife to it, pulling away, “I love you, Rio Harkness-Vidal.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She placed another kiss on her mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I swear it with all my heart.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Another kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are going to be a wonderful mother, my love,” she smiled down at her, taking her hand to rest against her stomach. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes glistened again before closing, allowing Agatha’s words to seep in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Want to know how I know?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head, still refusing to speak. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She placed a kiss to the corner of her lips, “I know because of how much strength you give me to go on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled softly, brushing a strand of hair away from Rio’s face, her touch gentle but full of affection. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know because I see the way you love me,” she murmured, her hand moving to cradle Rio’s face, thumb gently tracing her cheek. “The way you protect me, even foolishly at the cost of yourself. I see the way you fight for us, for everything we’ve built. I see you. </span>
<em>
<span>Te veo, mi amor.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes fluttered open, meeting Agatha’s gaze with something raw, vulnerable, a silent understanding between them. She exhaled shakily, as if Agatha’s words had been a lifeline she hadn’t known she needed. Agatha’s voice softened, a tender smile curling on her lips as she continued. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are so strong and you are doing so wonderfully, my love. You are going to be everything to our baby, all of that love you have for them already–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She paused, taking her own deep breath as her wife’s hand shook slightly against her stomach, the words settling between them like a sacred promise.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am so in awe of you. You’re going to be an incredible </span>
<em>
<span>mami.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out another shaking breath, her hand remaining on her stomach as her eyes refused to look at her now, “And what if I fail? Agatha, I can’t stand the thought of not being enough for you–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha silenced her with a kiss, “You don’t have to be perfect, Rio. You just have to be you. You are already everything to me and more. Please, my love, hear me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife reached up, moving her hands through her hair, fingers already playing with the baby hairs at the base of her neck as she was tugged down. Agatha smiled, their lips colliding as Rio seemed to speak her own words into the kiss. She could feel it deep within her heart, the apology, the gratitude, and the devotion. Rio’s hands were still restless on Agatha’s body, fingertips grazing over her skin in slow, deliberate strokes. The moment was tender, but the desire to continue what they had started was unmistakable in every touch, every press of her lips as they moved to Agatha’s neck. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha knew what her wife wanted: to give every bit of herself in return, every ounce of love she had. Her wife was always like this, always wanting to make sure her love for her was known, but Agatha could see something else on her wife’s face. The energy was draining her from her, her eyes drooping still with tiredness, and the red still hadn’t fully faded from both exhaustion and emotion. She pushed back slowly, her fingers trailing down Rio’s arms, grounding her.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Agatha whispered, her voice low but firm, “we’ll continue later, okay? You need rest. You’ve been carrying so much lately.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up at her, her expression a mix of frustration and longing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“But I want to give to you… I want to show you how much I love you, too,” she said, her voice a little more pleading, her breath still coming in short bursts. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed softly, brushing a few strands of Rio’s hair from her face, her fingers lingering on the warm skin of her cheek. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know, my love. And you will. But right now, I need you to rest, okay?” she kissed the corner of Rio’s mouth, soft and lingering. “We </span>
<em>
<span>both</span>
</em>
<span> need to rest.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s face softened, her gaze flickering between desire and exhaustion. She hesitated, but Agatha’s quiet insistence won. Slowly, albeit reluctantly, she sank back into the mattress. Agatha moved, burying her face back into Rio’s neck, taking in the scent of pine and cedar wood. Rio’s arms wrapped around her, one immediately going back down to her stomach, rubbing in smooth circles as Agatha felt her own exhaustion wash back over her. Her eyes fluttered closed, her body melting in the warmth of her wife’s body as her breathing slowed. She listened to her wife’s heart beat, it pumping slowly in a steady lulling thrum. She placed one last kiss to her neck, before allowing her eyes to close. </span>
</p><p><br/>

</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s body jolted awake, a sharp movement disturbing her peaceful sleep. She groaned, annoyed at the interruption. Her wife stirred beside her, the mattress dipping as Rio prepared to get out of bed. But Agatha wasn’t having it. With a swift motion, she reached out and grabbed Rio, pulling her back into bed. Rio gasped, momentarily caught off guard, before Agatha locked her legs around her, anchoring her in place. Her head found its resting spot on Rio’s bare chest, and a hand gently brushed through her hair. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio began, but Agatha mumbled into her chest, pressing herself deeper against the warmth of her wife’s skin. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio!” she groaned, her voice muffled. “Go back to sleep.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shifted again, a soft thump against the nightstand as she reached for something. Agatha, with a sigh of frustration, yanked her wife back toward her, refusing to let her go. Gods, Rio could never sit still for long. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha–” Rio started again, but this time there was something different in her tone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But she was too tired to care and found herself snapping, “What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reluctantly lifted her head, her tired eyes squinting in confusion. Her wife was holding up her phone. Agatha blinked a few times before her gaze fell on the lock screen: a picture of herself staring up at an owl in their backyard. The image was one Rio had sneakily snapped while Agatha was lost in thought. Her wife hadn’t shut up about it, proudly showing off the way she “ caught the perfect lighting” and “this is how I see you every day.” Agatha hated getting her picture taken. She almost shrugged, about to mutter something dismissive– probably just “cute” –but then her eyes widened as she noticed the time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was mid-afternoon on a Friday. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Friday. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Not Saturday. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They had slept in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>On a workday. </span>
</p><p>
<span>If Agatha wasn’t pregnant and exhausted, she would have shot up in a panic, rushing to get to the university. But one thought of her wife dealing with the rumors again, combined with the acknowledgment that she </span>
<em>
<span>really </span>
</em>
<span>didn’t want to get up, made her body sink back into the body beneath her and the warmth that was still there. With a contented sigh, Agatha threw her face back down into her wife’s breast, allowing the softness of Rio’s skin to pull her back into the comfortable embrace of sleep.</span>

<b>Rio</b>
</p><p> </p><p>If there was one thing about Rio Harkness-Vidal, it was that she was ambitious, persistent, and according to her wife, she never knew when to quit. It was one of her best and worst qualities, but damn, it worked in the most of ways when it came to her wife– although Agatha would tell you differently, but not now… no, Rio was finally doing what she wanted to do earlier. </p><p> </p><p>Despite the emotional rollercoaster of the last twenty-four hours, Rio felt at peace. Her and Agatha actually talked. It was rare and fuck, it was scary. Rio laid everything bare: her fears, her worries, and her love… and Agatha, oh her beautiful fucking wife, just listened, even when she thought she wasn’t. She didn’t really want Agatha to hear her speaking to their child. It was between the two of them, if the child heard her, but she needed to say it, but her wife heard her, and oh, it brought Rio to tears hearing her wife tell her she would be an incredible mother. Something in Rio needed that, just those few words to cut through the fog. </p><p>Her wife’s touch earlier lit something inside her and for a moment, it was like she was back on that small college dorm bed and Agatha was in her arms before moving down her body, exploring her for the first time, tasting her for the first time, <em> really seeing </em> her for the first time. The first time they had sex… for a lack of better words, it was magical. It wasn’t Rio’s first time, hell high school and leading up to Agatha, she was the classic lesbian fuck-boy. Sex was just sex at that time. She scored as many women as she wanted to and left the next day like nothing ever happened. The women were nothing, just someone to help let off some steam. But then, Rio met Agatha. She didn’t mean to, but she fell… hard. They weren’t even dating and Rio couldn’t even bring herself to look at another woman. And when they were dating, for the first time in her entire life, Rio was nervous. The idea of having sex with Agatha didn’t feel like <em> just </em> sex. It felt like she was taking another step in something huge. She couldn’t describe it at the time, but now she knew it was the first time she felt vulnerable during sex <em> and </em> still trusted someone to see her. </p><p>And fuck, it scared Rio. </p><p>To her luck for the first few months of dating, the furthest they had gotten was a messy make-out session with roaming hands, but Rio never wanted to pressure her. It was new. It was real. Rio normally pounced the moment she could with previous girlfriends and flings, but with Agatha, it made her want to do everything right. To her surprise, it was Agatha who initiated it. Hela, Rio’s roommate at the time, was out for the weekend and she figured they could have a nice time watching a movie in her room without having to walk out into the common area and Hela teasing her. </p><p>They were lying side by side, Agatha in the center of her bed, Rio against the pillows that lined the wall. Her at-the-time-girlfriend had started small, a light kiss to her cheek, then a peck to her lips, before another was placed a little longer, and next longer. She felt the brush of Agatha’s tongue against her lips and happily obliged. Then, after what felt like hours, she felt a hand on her hip, warm and firm. It had traced around the bone before moving her shirt up. Sparks had flown, shooting up her very being. </p><p>She could foggily remember what had happened next, but she remembered Agatha had moved to straddle her waist and Rio had looked up into those gorgeous eyes, searching them before she had whispered softly, “Are you sure?” </p><p>Her girlfriend had simply nodded and well, that night led to a similar situation she found herself in now. </p><p>Rio hummed, her fingers tracing along the outside of pale thighs that were wrapped around her head. Her tongue swirled, licking harshly up a side of a slick fold before delving back down, exploring with new enthusiasm. The taste of her wife consumed her senses, and she was right before, her wife did taste different. She had thought sweeter, and while it was true, there was something salty to her that she was quickly becoming addicted to. She smirked softly, but her tongue never wavered, pushing past the folds, searching for the burning heat of her wife’s inner walls. Fingers tangled in Rio’s hair, holding her in place as she shoved her tongue as deep as possible, her nose brushing across the soft bundle of nerves. </p><p>“Fuck, Rio,” her wife moaned above her, her hips lifting into her. </p><p>After promptly falling back asleep with her wife and deciding that work was a Monday problem, Rio had woken up hours later to her wife grinding against her thigh in her sleep. She knew she should have given her in return after her wife made her come, but her wife also needed the sleep as much as Rio did. Rio had smirked, moving her kisses along her wife’s neck, waiting for her to wake up and realize what she was doing. It didn’t take long. She watched as her wife’s eyes opened to reveal pupils so large they almost covered the piercing blue irises she adored. They kissed lazily afterward, Rio hoping to take things slow, to explore her wife as Agatha had done her, but her pregnant wife wasn’t having that. No, a tongue moved up against Rio’s cheek and her brain short circuited. The last time her wife had done that was in their kitchen when her wife wanted to get her back after Rio had left a hickey on her neck. </p><p>Something in Rio had taken control, a primal need as she had turned taking her wife’s tongue into her mouth and sucking lightly on it. And well, hours later, in between food and bathroom breaks, they hadn’t left their bed. </p><p> </p><p>Rio pushed her wife’s hips down, pinning her in place as her mouth moved up to her clit flicking at it with her tongue as her fingers came up, slipping two inside her wife with ease. Agatha gasped above her, more moans falling from her lips. She pulled her face away, watching her fingers disappear into pink silk folds. Her heart leapt as she stared, pushing her fingers in and out quickly, feeling the softness of her walls squeezing around her fingers. She scissored her fingers apart, stretching her wife, watching as a droplet of arousal ran down to her wrist. She almost moaned herself, her mouth open as she practically drooled at the sight of it. Rio added a third finger without resistance. Sweet wet noises filled the room along with her wife’s moans. She curled her fingers, retrieving another gasp before the hand on her head, tugged her back to her awaiting clit. She didn’t tease, no, Rio doubled her efforts, pumping her fingers faster and making her tongue flat as her wife rutted against her face. </p><p>“Fuck, fuck, yes, oh, just like that,” her wife’s words ran straight to her core. </p><p>She curled her fingers again, touching the spongy spot deep inside her wife and her wife jerked. She was close, she was so close. Thighs tightened around her head, the fingers laced through her hair, tugging harder, and above her, her wife started rambling incoherently. Her thrusts were erratic, desperate against her face and Rio took every breath she could in between but refusing to pull away until–</p><p>
<em> Knock. Knock. Knock.  </em>
</p><p>Rio lifted her head up, her face turned towards the hall where their front door was, but a sharp tug and a low growl from her wife forced her back to what she was doing. Her mouth returned, but she heard it again, this time insistent and louder. She groaned, all the annoyances of yesterday burning back through her body. Before she could pull away, there was another tug on her hair, her wife’s pussy clenched on her fingers, keeping her inside as legs tightened around her head, locking her in place. </p><p>“Rio, I swear to the fucking gods if you stop, you won’t– AH!” </p><p>She cut her wife off, plunging her fingers deeper, curling them with every thrust. She tuned out everything– everything except her wife’s moans and the loud squelching sound that echoed with every thrust of her fingers. Her tongue swirled around her, licking up, down, to the side and the other. She smirked, her teeth nicking the pink moistened skin before her lips wrapped around the angry bud and she sucked hard. Rio closed her eyes as hot liquid splashed onto her lips, splattering on her cheeks and thoroughly soaking her chin and hand. She continued licking, her long tongue gathering each drop as her wife shook, her thighs squeezing Rio’s head painfully. </p><p><em> What a wonderful way to die, </em>Rio mused to herself before pulling away as her wife went limp on the bed. </p><p>Pale thighs flopped down to the mattress on either side of her as her wife was taking deep breaths, her eyes closed, and her head rested back in their pillows. Rio kissed a thigh lovingly before making her way up her wife’s exhausted body. She paused at her stomach, leaving a longing kiss there before kissing up to her wife’s cheeks, coaxing her gently from her high. Getting Agatha to squirt wasn’t something Rio could always accomplish. It wasn’t something her wife usually did, but fuck, when she did, Rio was smug about it for the rest of the day. Sue her, it was hot, especially with her belly slightly rounded. Oh, Rio couldn’t wait until her wife was more sensitive, more needy– she half wondered if it was already starting. She read somewhere that women usually get an influx of their libido and Rio was more than happy to appease her wife. </p><p>Hands came up, caressing her jaw before pulling her into a sweet kiss. She moaned when a tongue came out, her wife tasting herself on Rio’s tongue, lips, and cheeks–</p><p>
<em> Knock! Knock! Knock! </em>
</p><p>Rio audibly growled as her wife pushed her away, but placed a peck on her cheek, “You should check that.” </p><p>She shot her wife a glare but Agatha was already curling up on her side, her eyes fluttering close as she tried normalizing her breathing. She sighed, kissing her wife’s lips quickly before running into their bathroom. Rio cleaned her mouth and chest clean before reaching down and unbuckling the harness around her hips. It fell to the floor with an unceremonious thud before she grabbed the mouthwash and looked around the bathroom, swishing the minty liquid around her mouth. To her dismay, it washed the taste of her wife away, but if she was forced to open up the fucking front door, whoever it was didn’t need to know where her mouth just was. She could still hear the knocking and everything in her made her want to open the door with a gun in her hand for disrupting her night. Spitting into the sink, then grabbed the first robe on the door, finding it was her wife’s purple and black satin one she had bought her for Valentine's. </p><p>The silky fabric was cool against her flushed skin, in fact Rio was all too aware of the state she was in. Her hair was probably in a rat’s nest around her shoulders and she knew how deep the marks on her chest were where the robe did nothing to hide them. She closed their bedroom door quietly behind her before marching towards the front door. The knocking was sharper now and she swore she heard muffled voices on the other side, but it was all drowned out by herself. </p><p>“<em> ¿Por qué diablos está pasando esto? Lo juro por los dioses, si no es importante, apuñalaré a quien esté aquí, </em> ” she muttered to herself before pulling the door open with more force than necessary. “¿ <em> Qué carajo quieres? </em>” (Why the hell is this happening? I swear to the gods, if it’s not important, I will stab whoever is here. What the fuck do you want?)</p><p>Jen and Alice stood there, shivering as in the background, with only the view of the porch lights, snow rained down. They pushed past her, not looking up at her as they rubbed their arms, peeling off their boots already. </p><p>“Gods, Vidal, what the fuck took you so long? It’s fucking freezing out there,” Alice shook before finally looking up at her, her worried expression melting into shock.</p><p>Jen stood stiff beside her, her eyes wide and it seemed she wanted to bolt back out into the cold. Their eyes dragged over Rio’s dishevelled appearance– the tangled black hair, the faint sheen of sweat still clinging to her skin, and most notably, the deep, dark hickeys trailing down from her collarbone, barely concealed by the satin robe. A slow, knowing grin spread across Alice’s lips as Jen’s lips grew into a disgusted purse. </p><p>“Damn, Rio,” Alice drawled, tilting her head as she crossed her arms. “You could have at least hid the evidence instead of acting like we <em> interrupted </em> something.” </p><p>Rio exhaled sharply through her nose, leveling Alice with an unimpressed stare. </p><p>“You <em> did </em> interrupt,” she said flatly, closing the door behind them. “In fact, Agatha was–” </p><p>“NOPE,” Jennifer practically jumped in place, hands flying up as if she could physically stop Rio’s words. “Do not finish that sentence.” </p><p>Rio’s smirk turned wicked as she purposefully leaned against the door, eyes glinting with mischief, “Oh? But you came all this way. It’s only fair you know exactly what you interrupted.” </p><p>She dragged a finger along the collar of the robe, deliberately drawing attention to the bruises dotting her skin. “I was on my knees in between Agatha’s–” </p><p>Jennifer let out a strangled noise. </p><p>“<em> Enough </em>!” she grabbed Alice’s arm, as if trying to physically haul her away before Rio could continue. “We came to check if you were alive, not to be scarred for life!”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, pushing herself up off the door, and going into the kitchen. They followed her as she pulled out two wine glasses and grabbed a bottle from a higher shelf. She turned, finding them already sitting at the counter as she passed them the wine glasses before preparing tea for herself. She kept her back turned, slightly wishing she could just throw the bottle back, but Rio already promised her wife if Agatha wasn’t drinking, neither was she. She missed the exchanged look from the couple behind her, staring at the kettle as it heated up. She knew why they were here, but fuck, Agatha and her still had yet to talk about the rumors. </p><p>Alice cleared her throat, her voice losing the usual tease, “You do know people are talking, right?”</p><p>Rio felt her fists clench as she stopped herself from stalking back to their bedroom and taking her wife right there to let out her frustrations. She gripped the counter, muttering a few curses out in Spanish before growling. </p><p>“Yes, I am fucking pregnant. Agatha and I are married. Anything fucking else?” she whipped around, finding the couple shrinking back slightly. </p><p>Jen and Alice looked at each other again, before Jen put her hand on Alice’s back, “Yes, actually. It grew worse today when you and Agatha didn’t show without notice.”</p><p>Rio froze, tilting her head, “‘Grew worse’ how?” </p><p>Jennifer sighed, “Honestly? It’s not great, Rio.” </p><p>“What exactly is being said?” she couldn’t keep the growl out of her voice. </p><p>Alice hesitated for a second, taking a breath, “Rio, please don’t stab me–”</p><p>“Out with it!” she snapped, turning back to the tea. </p><p>“They’re saying you and Agatha are having an affair– that she’s sleeping her way through the faculty, but more importantly, taking advantage of you,” Alice rambled out quickly.  </p><p>The kettle clattered against the counter. </p><p>Rio’s jaw locked, her hands curling into fists, “Excuse me?” </p><p>Her voice was low, dangerous. </p><p>Alice shifted slightly, eyeing her warily, “It’s bullshit, obviously. But it’s getting around.” </p><p>Rio’s nostrils flared, a single eye twitching as rage spilled from her, vibrating her very bones. </p><p>She started pacing, her hands flying in the air– a habit she slowly picked up from her wife, “Agatha doesn’t need this fucking shit! She’s pregnant for fuck’s sake and now, they want to slander her through the mud?”</p><p>She laughed, but it was dark, emotionless as she ran her hand down her face, “I was fine with them thinking I was pregnant–”</p><p>Rio was not.</p><p>“Fuck, they can say whatever about me.” </p><p>Over her dead body.</p><p>“But <em> my wife? </em>” she snarled, slamming her hands down on the counter, rattling the wine glasses. </p><p>Jen sat up, reaching her hand out but ultimately decided to pull back, “We know. That’s why we’re telling you this. So you’re both prepared.” </p><p>Rio let out another sharp, humorless laugh, “Prepared? You think we need to be prepared to deal with a bunch of pathetic, gossiping groups of cunts.” </p><p>She shook her head, trying to keep herself calm, but everything was screaming to go to that fucking university and slit every single one of their throats. </p><p>“Agatha shouldn’t have to deal with their bullshit just because they can’t keep their miserable lives interesting without dragging us into it.” </p><p>Alice gave her a look, “You’re not exactly known for being approachable, Rio. People don’t know much about you two, and when people don’t know, they speculate.” </p><p>Rio scoffed, “Right. So, what? We’re supposed to just play nice, let them talk shit, and hope it dies down?” </p><p>She laughed bitterly, “Fuck that.” </p><p>Jen sighed again, “No, but–” </p><p>“Because let me fucking tell you something,” Rio continued, venom lacing her tone. “If I hear one more fucking word about my wife from some jealous, washed-up–” </p><p>“Down, girl.”</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched as everyone else in the room stilled. Rio looked up, finding her wife leaning against the door frame, her eyes sparkling. She was the picture of composure compared to what Rio looked like. Her hair was brushed, tame and curling down to her waist. She wore Rio’s crew neck <em> and </em>Rio’s sweatpants. But something in Rio softened and for a moment, the anger dissipated as she found her wife’s hands on her stomach, rubbing the small bump that showed as she flattened the pine green sweatshirt around it. </p><p>She felt frozen in place as Agatha pushed herself off the wall, rounding around the counter to face Rio. She cupped her cheeks gently, grounding her and easing her racing heart ever so slightly, “Breathe, my love. Go, get dressed and we all will talk when you’re ready.” </p><p>Rio grumbled, but kissed her wife quickly before stomping back to her room, muttering more curses underneath her breath as she went. From the kitchen, she still heard them. </p><p>“Jesus, Harkness, I don’t think anyone could reel Rio back like that,” Alice snickered. </p><p>She could already see her wife’s smug face, “Well, she’s well trained.” </p><p>That made Rio only mutter more curses as she slammed the bedroom door behind her. Rio huffed as she yanked open the dresser drawers, pulling out a fresh pair of sweatpants and one of her old college hoodies. She stripped off the silky robe, tossing it onto the bed before changing, her mind still fuming with everything Alice and Jen had just told her. Who the fuck was spreading those rumors? She was already trying to wrap her head around about the fact that people were stupid enough to think that <em> she </em> was pregnant and <em> why the fuck did they care. </em>Her life wasn’t some goddamn spectacle or some fucking story for someone to write fanfiction about. Rio had been dealing with people’s assumptions her whole life– cold, unapproachable, a bitch. Fine. Let them think that. But Agatha? Pregnant, exhausted, and now the center of these fucking rumors? Absolutely fucking not. </p><p>She shoved a hand through her messy black hair, forcing a deep breath through her nose before she stormed out of the bedroom, only somewhat more presentable. When she stepped back into the hall, she found the group had migrated into the living room. Her wife had settled herself in the love seat, curled up and sipping tea like she wasn’t the goddamn center of a vicious university-wide scandal. Jen and Alice turned when they heard her, their shoulders visibly tensing. Probably because Rio looked like she was two seconds away from committing murder. Agatha, on the other hand, barely reacted. She simply tilted her head at her wife, then patted the empty seat beside her. </p><p>“Sit, <em> mi vida </em>.”</p><p>Rio grumbled, but obeyed, dropping into the seat with a heavy sigh but ultimately curled herself where her wife was quickly moving back against her. Her hands automatically landed on her stomach, tracing gentle circles as her wife nodded to the tea on the coffee table in front of them, clearly for her. She ignored it, pulling her wife closer, her hands remaining on her stomach. </p><p>Alice, perhaps foolishly, was the first to break the silence, “So… do either of you know who might be spreading this shit?” </p><p>“Don’t have to,” Rio muttered darkly, resting her chin on top of her wife’s head. “I can just go to work Monday and let them all know <em> exactly </em> what I think about their little gossip circles.” </p><p>“Darling,” Agatha sighed, resting a hand on Rio’s thigh, “as much as I would love seeing you go full cold, bitchy Dean Vidal on people, that might not be the best strategy.” </p><p>Rio scowled, “Then what, <em> mi amor </em> ? We just let them think you’re fucking your way through the faculty while pregnant with <em> our </em> child?” </p><p>Jen, wisely, took a gulp of wine to avoid responding. </p><p>Alice, however, scoffed, “I mean, to be fair, Harkness, you <em> do </em> have that whole mysterious, hot professor vibe–” </p><p>“Babe,” Jen warned. </p><p>“–and people <em> are </em> nosy.” </p><p>Rio shot her a glare, “Oh, thank you, Alice. That makes me feel so much better.” </p><p>Alice held up her hands, “I’m just saying, people will talk, and if you keep shutting them down the way you always do, they’ll only make up worse shit. You two don’t have to go on stage and make out in front of everyone–” </p><p>Agatha hummed, “Tempting.” </p><p>Alice made a face,  “–<em> but </em> maybe it’s time to stop pretending you’re just colleagues.” </p><p>Rio exhaled sharply, looking down at where Agatha’s hand still rested on her thigh, “You really think just admitting everything will make them shut up?” </p><p>“No,” Agatha said simply. “But it will take away their fun. If they have no mystery to unravel, they’ll get bored and move on.” </p><p>Rio tongued at the inside of her cheek, the muscles in her jaw ticking. </p><p>Then, finally, she muttered, “Fine.” </p><p>Agatha squeezed her thigh, “Good girl.” </p><p>Rio whipped her head down towards her wife, her eyes darkening slightly with annoyance, as Alice and Jen both choked on their drinks.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Her wife hated the idea, she knew it. Even when their friends left, she could practically hear her wife’s thoughts buzzing in her head while she cooked dinner. Agatha had sat at the counter, listening to Rio mutter to herself, too low and too fast in Spanish for her to catch, but she knew exactly what Rio was thinking. They had two more weeks. Two more weeks and they were on break. If they could just hold on for a little bit longer and then it would be just them for a month and a half– a month and half for her to also start noticeably showing. She swore the kid in her was growing by the day though, and that it wasn’t just her being bloated. Her favorite purple pants were already becoming too tight, not to mention her wife already had to go out of her way one day to get Agatha new bras. She was approaching her twelfth week and the curve of her stomach was definitely there now. She half wondered how big this baby would be. She had no information on her side of the family and she wasn’t about to call Evanora Harkness and ask her what her pregnancy was like. Surprisingly worse, Rio couldn’t ask her <em> abuelita </em> . They still had yet to tell anyone outside of the coven and she knew Rio <em> really </em>didn’t want to tell her sisters. </p><p>By Sunday evening, Agatha spoke what was on her wife’s mind, telling her they would wait the two weeks out. Agatha was perfectly capable of listening to the rumors, in fact, if her wife wasn’t so upset, she probably would have laughed… well, she did laugh when she heard the rumor that Rio was pregnant. She didn’t fully expect her wife to be angry and upset over it. Rio could handle anything, but after their talk, she saw how nervous Rio was to become a mother, and every day since, she would casually sneak in some compliment of how wonderful of a mother Rio would be. </p><p>They were just little things, like when Rio fetched her craving food in the night, she would casually say, “You know, you’re really going to spoil our kid with all these midnight errand runs. I can already hear them complaining when they can’t get a midnight Nando’s if you’re not around.” </p><p>Or when Rio was tucking her in with a blanket during her midday nap: “Ah, yes, the maternal instinct is strong in you,” she said, her voice dripping with playful mockery. “Keep this up, and our little one will have you running around doing their bidding before they even know how to speak.”</p><p>They were teasing, but it was what Agatha knew best, and she knew her Rio would understand the true meaning behind them. </p><p> </p><p>By the time Agatha was wrapped around in her wife’s strong arms that Sunday night in bed, she kissed underneath her jaw, telling her that they would be fine. The baby would be fine and when they came back from break, they would handle it then. If anyone asked about her pregnancy, Agatha would simply say, “Yes, my wife, Rio…” It seemed to relax her wife and she knew it always made the possessive side of her wife smirk. </p><p> </p><p>When Monday came around, they were happy for a change of schedule. It was Hell Week, and that meant no classes, just office hours and grading. Agatha snuck into Rio’s office, leaving a note on her door for students to email her if they wanted to meet. It wasn’t ideal for them, but she didn’t care. To her surprise, she was able to sneak into the science building without being spotted, and happily slipped into her wife’s office, sitting on her couch and grading in silence. That was until her wife’s phone rang. Her wife barely paid attention, already elbow deep in preparing for the next semester as she answered the phone putting it on speaker. </p><p>“Dean Vidal,” she answered sharply. </p><p>“Rio, glad you’re answering,” the light voice of Pepper Stark replied, making both of them freeze. </p><p>Pepper Stark was technically Rio’s boss. She was the Chancellor of the university, one of the officer positions that Rio had tried explaining to her many times, but eventually Agatha didn’t care enough to actually listen to her wife talking about another woman. They were somewhat friends and they knew each other from the PhD program, and having been invited to their wedding. </p><p>Rio sat up, running her hand through her hair, “Pepper, sorry, I didn’t look at the caller ID. Something I can do for you?” </p><p>Agatha stopped writing, watching the tension coil in her wife. She stood up, walking around her desk and placing a gentle hand on her shoulder to help ground her. Her wife turned, pulling her between her legs, her hands immediately going to her stomach. She let her, realizing how much her pregnant stomach, no matter how small it was, grounded her wife and it made something in her chest do a few funny flips. </p><p>“Yes, why the hell are your and Agatha’s names flying through campus like a hurricane. I thought you two were keeping your marriage on the DL and then I heard you’re pregnant. Is this a congrats or not, Vidal?” </p><p>Their eyes met, and Agatha simply nodded, telling her wife it was fine to continue, “I don’t know what is happening, Pepper. It’s not even like we have done anything to cause it. I heard it from a student–”</p><p>“Yes, she was crying her eyes out. I heard it from Kale who comforted the girl. Jesus, Vidal, do I even want to know what you said– actually no, I don’t, but the pregnancy?” </p><p>Agatha leaned down, placing a kiss on her wife’s head, “Yes, well, I have been meaning to talk to you and Tony about that–”</p><p>“So it’s true! Rio, congratulations! You should have told me sooner. We can start talking about your maternity leave for next semester and then we can talk about your wife when she should leave to join your side–”</p><p>“Pepper,” her wife groaned, slumping back in her chair, running her hands through her hair again. “<em> I </em> am not pregnant. I don’t even know how that started. It’s my wife who <em> is </em> pregnant. We were going to send a draft to you for our plan for next semester.”</p><p>There was a moment of silence before Pepper gasped, her voice echoing in Rio’s office as Agatha reached over, turning the volume down, “Agatha is pregnant?! Oh, Rio, congratulations and send my congrats to Harkness.”</p><p>“Thank you–”</p><p>“Just send me her due date and then I will plan the rest from there. I <em> will </em>be letting you both go at the same time and before you fight me on that: can it, Vidal. You deserve as much time off as your wife. Now that’s all settled, are you both coming to the mixer next Friday?” </p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>Rio wanted no part of the mixer and they were both sure that by then, Agatha would be showing a good bit– at least to the point that her tight dresses were not going to fit without showing off her stomach… if she could even fit her breasts into them. The rest of the week had gone on smoothly, despite the interruptions of their students checking their work with them. Rio didn’t mind, partially surprised her Freshmen students were brave enough to check in with her, but Agatha cared, because it meant either staying in her office, away from Rio, or doing her walk of shame across campus back to her office just to sneak back into her wife’s office. Both of them stayed away from their colleagues and it worked… for them. Alice, Jen, and Lilia texted them their reports and the rumors stayed the same. </p><p> </p><p>It was Saturday morning, the day of their twelve week ultrasound. Her wife was already up, making them tea and preparing Agatha’s craving food– pickles with peanut butter and caramel ice cream on the side. Agatha thought Rio was going to kill her last night though. She had tried sneaking out at three am to run to the gas station where they had fresh churros and potstickers. It was only a ten minute drive, so twenty minutes driving, maybe about another total of ten minutes of waiting on her food and back home. Thirty minutes and her wife wouldn’t even notice. </p><p>Rio did. She practically ripped their bedroom door off its hinges just as Agatha was putting on her shoes to go and keys in hand. Her wife had groaned, yelling at her to stay put as she went and changed before swiping the keys off of her and driving them. It took an hour in total because of the college students that decided to stay up then to study and needed a snack. Her wife forced her to stay in the car and came out twenty minutes later and it took them an extra twenty minutes to get home because Agatha then decided she wanted a milkshake from McDonald’s. For the first time ever, the ice cream machine was working. By the time they came back through the door, it was a little after four and Rio had collapsed back into bed, firmly passing out while Agatha finished her milkshake and crawled back into her wife’s arms. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was tearing through their drawers, trying to find a pair of stretchy sweat pants because she was tired of her pants digging into her. Her wife had already planned them to go shopping for maternity clothes after the ultrasound and she really wanted to kill her. Agatha hated shopping, despite the outrageous amount of clothes she had– to be fair most of them were gifts from her wife. She groaned, throwing on her wife’s sweat shirt and making her way out into the kitchen in just that in her underwear. Before she could go to the basement where the laundry room was, her wife was already approaching her, her eyes trailing on her legs.</p><p>“<em> Buenos días, cariño </em>,” her wife cooed at her, pressing a kiss to her lips before her hand found her stomach.</p><p>Oh, and she was showing now. It wasn’t outrageous, but the little baby bump was undeniable. She noticed it halfway through the week and Rio had been all over since. </p><p> “<em> Y mi pequeño extraterrestre. Estoy emocionado de verte hoy.” </em>(And my little alien. I’m excited to see you today.)</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but roll her eyes, but placed a hand over Rio’s, watching at how her wife’s brown eyes were sparkling as she stared down at her stomach.</p><p>“Oh,” Rio made a mock gasp. “<em> Sí, estoy de acuerdo, pequeño extraterrestre. Tu mamá necesita unos pantalones. Ella no está contenta porque tenemos que ir de compras después de verte. </em>”  (Yes, I agree, little alien. Your mom needs some pants. She isn’t happy because we have to go shopping after seeing you.)</p><p>She shook her head, “You realize they can’t hear you, right? Not until I’m–”</p><p>“<em> –veintitrés semanas. Lo sé. Dioses, tu mamá no es divertida, </em>” her wife rolled her eyes at her. (twenty-three weeks. I know. Gods, your mama is no fun.)</p><p>Agatha smirked as she cupped Rio’s cheeks, tilting her head up to meet her gaze. Without hesitation, she crashed her lips against her wife’s, slipping her tongue into her mouth with a deliberate intensity. She deepened the kiss, her tongue teasing and swirling around Rio’s until a quiet gasp escaped her. Rio’s hands instinctively found Agatha’s hips, while Agatha’s own hands roamed down the curves of her wife’s figure. Just as quickly as she started, Agatha pulled away, smirking as she gave Rio’s ass a firm squeeze before stepping back.</p><p> “<em> ¿Qué te parece eso de ‘no es divertida’? </em> ” she teased, raising an eyebrow before sauntering past her stunned wife, punctuating her departure with a playful slap on Rio’s ass. “ <em> Te olvidas que aprendí el idioma por ti, mi corazón negro. </em>” (How’s that for ‘no fun’? Did you forget I learned the language for you, my black heart.)</p><p>She chuckled darkly as she turned towards the basement before feeling hands on her waist, pulling her back. She laughed loudly, soft lips attacking her neck and head as her body warmed at her wife’s affections. Her wife laughed with her before pulling away, leaving with a longing kiss to her head. </p><p>“<em> Come, mi amada esposa,” </em>her wife replied, before running down the steps. (Eat, my darling wife.) </p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b>***</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha fidgeted with her hands, picking at her nails as her and her wife sat back in the teal chairs of the clinic. She couldn’t keep her leg from bouncing, and it took everything in her to not bite at her nails. Her wife reached over, breaking her hands apart with ease, giving it a gentle squeeze as she continued filling out the paperwork for her. </p><p>“Relax, <em> mi vida, </em>everything is going to be fine or is this about the shopping?” her wife whispered as she clipped the pen back in place. </p><p>Agatha shot her a glare before rubbing her hand over her stomach, “Shit, we have to shop for the baby too.” </p><p>Rio laughed at that, a genuine light hearted chuckle that made Agatha’s heart do that little flip again, “Yes, <em> cariño. </em>Don’t worry, we still have time. I might have already bought a stroller though.” </p><p>She whipped her head towards her wife, her eyes wide, “What? When?”</p><p>Her wife shrugged, “I don’t know, during one of my students’ exams. I was bored and I already had it in the shopping cart <em> and </em> it went on sale. Some special deal. Don’t worry, <em> cariño. </em>You’ll love it. It evolves with them as they grow and it has a storage thing underneath.” </p><p>She shook her head, chuckling, “Imagine if they saw their intimidating professor gushing over baby things online while they were testing– Vidal, you’re losing your edge.” </p><p>“Well, they didn’t see and no, I’m not.” </p><p>“Says the woman who was just talking to her wife’s stomach.” </p><p>Before her wife could quip back at her, the door opened, revealing a younger nurse, “Agatha Harkness-Vidal.” </p><p>They both stood up, Rio handing the clipboard to the nurse before following her back. They were led down the same halls, and into a room where the machines hummed with life.</p><p>“Dr. Walsh will be right in. You can sit on the table, take your shoes off, and then just pull your shirt up.” </p><p>The moment the door closed, Agatha handed Rio her longer coat and slipped off her shoes as she pulled herself up. Rio set their stuff down in the chair that was meant for her to sit in but Rio was back by her side, her hand taking hers and kissing her knuckles softly. She smiled, everything in her warm as her wife practically bounced beside her with excitement. </p><p>A sharp knock echoed on the door before Dr. Walsh stepped in, a smile on her face, “Agatha, Rio, good morning. How are you doing today?” </p><p>Rio smiled as Agatha spoke, “Well, the morning sickness has passed for the most part and the cravings have been hitting.”</p><p>“That’s good, and look at that, you’re showing already. Every mother is different, just keep that in mind. Any discomfort?” she asked while pulling up her computer, already typing away. </p><p>Agatha shook her head, “No, just tired and a little dizzy sometimes.” </p><p>Dr. Walsh shook her head, moving to the equipment around them, “That’s perfectly normal. Any concerns or questions?” </p><p>She shook her head as the ultrasound machine switched to life, a louder humming echoing in the room. Agatha squeezed her wife’s hand, a smile stretching her lips that she couldn’t hold back as Dr. Walsh placed her gloves on before grabbing a bottle to the side. </p><p>“Alright, now, how about we have a look at your little one? We should be able to find their hands and feet. They’ll look more human this time,” she moved forward as Agatha pulled back her shirt more, revealing her stomach rounded by life. “Alright, this will be cold.” </p><p>Dr. Walsh applied the gel to Agatha’s stomach, and a slight chill ran through her before the coldness of the ultrasound wand followed. She flinched just a little, but Rio’s thumb against the back of her hand kept her grounded. The machine hummed as Dr. Walsh gently moved the wand over her skin. The screen flickered to life, showing a blurry, greyish image, but soon the shapes began to sharpen, revealing tiny limbs and a little outline of the baby’s head. Agatha gasped, her breath catching in her throat. </p><p>“There’s their head,” Dr. Walsh pointed out with a soft chuckle. “And here are their arms... and their legs. You can already see their little feet.” </p><p>Agatha couldn’t tear her eyes away from the screen, her fingers tightening around Rio’s. She could barely believe it, the life inside her was real, and sure they had seen it six weeks ago, but finally seeing their little arms and legs, Agatha could hardly put words to it. Everything in her stilled, a strange sense of calm overtaking her as Rio’s hand tightened around hers, both of them staring with stupor as the heart beat entered the room again. </p><p> </p><p><em> Lub-dub. Lub-dub. Lub-dub </em>. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha froze, once again, tears streaming down her cheeks again, the weight hitting her all at once. The world came to a pause, the same feelings washing over her as she stared on. No matter how many times she heard that heartbeat, it would hit her all the same. It was a rush, an overwhelming sense of love and pride that she felt within her very soul… cause in that screen– <em> inside her </em>, was the very product of Rio and her, the truth of their love spelling out over and over again. </p><p>Dr. Walsh moved the wand slightly, and the baby’s tiny feet became clearer, kicking gently on the screen. </p><p>“They’re already active. Look at that,” she said with a smile, her tone warm and encouraging.</p><p>Rio laughed and it was a sound Agatha had never heard before– it was softer than the snow outside, lighter than the clouds, and a sweeter tune than a loon could ever sing. Her heart rushed as the world was solely them. She didn’t bother to stop the tears, watching as tiny hands moved out before the little feet started kicking around again. </p><p>This was real. </p><p>This was their love. </p><p>This was all of their dreams coming true with just the mere movement of a child no bigger than a lime. </p><p>“Everything looks great. The baby is strong, their heartbeat steady, and they’re the perfect size,” Dr. Walsh smiled, clicking a few more things on her computer before switching the ultrasound off. </p><p>Agatha turned back to Rio who had that perfect, lopsided smile on her face. Everything in her fluttered as her wife wiped her tears before taking the towel from Dr. Walsh and cleaning off her stomach with the utmost care. </p><p>“If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to call. The pictures will be at the nurses station for you to make your next appointment between eighteen and twenty weeks. You may start to feel them move as early as sixteen weeks and by your next appointment, hopefully they’ll be in a position to see their gender if you want that.”</p><p>Rio smirked, “Yes, we have a bet that I would very much like to win.” </p><p>Agatha playfully smacked her arm as she sat up, making both her wife and the doctor laugh, “Don’t get your hopes up, Mrs. Harkness-Vidal. The mothers who carry normally have sixth sense. I’ll see you both in six weeks.” </p><p>With that, the Dr. Walsh stepped out, leaving Agatha to put her shoes on. The moment she stood up straight, Rio’s arms were around her, her lips on hers. The kiss was sweet, grounding as her wife’s hands found their perch on her stomach. </p><p>“<em> Te amo, mi hermosa esposa, </em>” Rio whispered, and the words hit Agatha’s heart with a weight she hadn’t expected. </p><p>It was the same feeling as the first time Rio had said it, at the altar, when she had promised her heart to Agatha forever. The same rush from their wedding day, when Rio had dipped her back, whispering promises to hold her soul for all time.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<b>Rio</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She groaned, staring at the two suits. Tonight was the mixer and Rio was one more inconvenience away from skipping completely. Her wife wasn’t going, which it took forever to convince her not to as listed off the reasons to her too many times. One: mainly she knew she wouldn’t be able to not be by her side or keep her hands to herself. Two: Agatha was a nightmare while shopping and wouldn’t even try on dresses so that left her other dresses that were now too tight. Three: she knew how her colleagues were and while Agatha could handle herself with the rumors and speculations around her, Rio could not. She knew if she went by herself there wouldn’t be as much talk. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife sat on the bed behind her and Rio could practically feel her eyes burning into the back of her head. She eyed the black and green pieces again, frustration smothering her at the thought of having to deal with everything— forcing her way through conversations, her fake smile, charming her own bosses, and actively avoiding questions about her supposed pregnancy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” her wife spoke softly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She only returned her acknowledgement with an indignant grunt before throwing both of her suits back into their closest, absentmindedly searching through as the clatter of hangers echoed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can tell you don’t want to go,” her wife called from their bed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stepped out, her arms crossed as she stared at her wife. She was sitting at the edge of their bed in Rio’s shorts and the new bra Rio had bought her a couple days ago. Of course, her eyes refused to meet her wife’s, instead she was staring at the curve of her stomach. Her wife was thirteen weeks and she was stunning in every way. She partially wished they were going together, to put an end to all this bullshit, but it wasn’t energy they wished to waste… no, they had a new problem. It was Agatha and Rio’s turn to host Yule this season and that meant not only Alice and Lilia, but also Rio’s sisters. Hela wasn’t coming this year and the rest of their old friends were scattered across the world. Jen was going to be there, though, which was a new addition and Pepper and Tony said they would try to stop by. </span>
<em>
<span>They </span>
</em>
<span>weren’t the issue no. The problem was Rio’s older twin sisters. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite how much Agatha had told her to just “woman-up” and tell her sisters so they could tell her </span>
<em>
<span>abuelita</span>
</em>
<span>, Rio found herself frozen. Oriana would be thrilled, she knew that, but if Oriana knew that they told everyone else first, well, Rio was sure her sister would hold it over her for the rest of her life. Maria, however– ugh, Rio wishes she throttled the bitch when she was younger. Maria was the complete opposite of her. According to Maria, Rio wasn’t even a real doctor, just a fancy title and nothing special. Maria did well for herself, sure, she was working in some high level corporation that Rio never bothered to remember. Her sister was always supposed to be the golden child of their family– well, that all went away when Rio got engaged and eventually married. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The matriarch of the Vidal family, the very beating heart that held them all together, their </span>
<em>
<span>abuelita, </span>
</em>
<span>adored them all, but when they were younger, she always gravitated towards Maria. She could cook, knew how to sew and knit, played the piano, got straight As– see? The golden child. What made Maria even better in their </span>
<em>
<span>abuelita’s </span>
</em>
<span>eyes was how much Rio got in trouble, but once again, that was because her older sister </span>
<em>
<span>always </span>
</em>
<span>told on Rio for everything. In Rio’s defense, most of the things she did weren’t even true… minus the amount of fights she got into… also the amount of times she was caught having sex with other women… also that one time she robbed a gas station and got away with it except when it came to </span>
<em>
<span>abuelita</span>
</em>
<span>… also the piercings… also the weed… </span>
</p><p>
<span>Okay, so Rio was nowhere near being the golden child of the family, but every time she got caught, it was Maria who ratted her out. So, naturally nobody expected much of anything from her. She was the black sheep– </span>
<em>
<span>la oveja negra</span>
</em>
<span>. No one expected her to get a full ride to Harvard, no one expected her to be the first one to settle down, and no one had expected her to get a PhD from one of the world’s prestigious universities: The Salemites' University. Rio was supposed to be nothing but, fuck, did she love proving people wrong. So when “</span>
<em>
<span>la oveja negra” </span>
</em>
<span>had the first grandchild of the family… she knew her </span>
<em>
<span>abuelita</span>
</em>
<span> would be so proud of her, so excited, but most importantly, she knew Maria, Oriana, and their cousins would never hear the end of it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She could already hear her </span>
<em>
<span>abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>scolding them: “</span>
<em>
<span>¡¿Y qué hay de ti, eh?! ¡Mírala, mi Riocita, dándome un bisnieto antes que tú! ¿Y tú? ¡Nada! Ni un novio o una novia, ni un marido o una mujer, ¡ni siquiera un intento! ¡Qué vergüenza! Hasta el más problemático de todos vosotros me da un bisnieto, pero vosotros, nada. </span>
</em>
<b>
<em>¡Nada!</em>
</b>
<em>
<span> ¡Bah! ¿Qué esperas, que muera antes de ver más bisnietos? Ponte manos a la obra, estúpido.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>(And what about you, huh?! Look at her, my little Rio, giving me a great-grandchild before you! And you? Nothing! Not a boyfriend or girlfriend, not a husband or wife, not even a try! What a shame! Even the most troublesome of you all gives me a great-grandchild, but you, nothing. </span>
<em>
<span>Nothing</span>
</em>
<span>! Bah! What do you expect, that I die before seeing more great-grandchildren? Get your damn act together, stupid.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked just imagining it. She could picture the way </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita</span>
</em>
<span> would puff up with pride, how she’d hold Rio’s face in her wrinkled hands and kiss her forehead like she used to when Rio was little– before all the trouble, before Maria’s constant tattling, before the reputation. Agatha, her poor wife, would immediately be smothered by her </span>
<em>
<span>abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>worrying. She thought Rio was obsessed with her stomach? The moment Ximena Vidal got her hands on Agatha, her wife was done for. But she could see it now: her cousins shifting uncomfortably, Oriana trying not to laugh, and Maria gritting her teeth so hard it was a miracle they didn’t crack. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Gods, it would be worth it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But first, she had to tell them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And that was the part that made her stomach twist. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I don’t,” she admitted, rubbing the tension in her head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife tilted her head at her, sitting back with her arms propping her up, “Then don’t, my love. You have a lot going on–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But I am the dean and Jen, Alice, and Lilia–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can survive without you, love. Look, they know how much stress has been on you the past two weeks. They are not going to be upset if you rather stay in or if you decided to let your dear pregnant wife surprise you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio opened up her mouth before closing it. For a moment, she looked like a fish out of water, opening and closing her mouth before finding the right words in English. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Surprise me?” she finally questioned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife smirked, nodding, “You let me dress you for tonight.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife stood now, walking towards her and Rio was entranced. It was like a cosmic entity trapped her under a spell. She swallowed hard, feeling as if her wife casted a spell where her feet had decided to grow roots, and hold her where she stood. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You let me take you to your surprise,” her wife practically purred, brushing Rio’s hair from her face before cupping her jaw. “And then, you take me home…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife drawled out the words, her lips kissing up her neck as Rio’s breath hitched. Her wife’s teeth scraped at her skin as her lips reached her ear. A hand came down to her hip before gripping her cheek, and fuck, Rio was nothing but a puddle as her wife nipped and teased her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“...lie back in bed with that delicious strap on your hips, and just sit back and watch, mmm? How does that sound?” her wife whispered in her ear before abruptly pulling away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuck, her wife wanted to kill her… her wife <em>was</em> actively killing her and somehow this seemed only the beginning of it. Rio felt her mouth drop, her eyes dark as her wife wore her signature smirk, chuckling darkly. Yeah, she definitely wasn’t going to survive her wife’s pregnancy. She was either going to die from her wife’s libido or from mood swings… and at this point, both were an even percentage of chance it would happen. She couldn’t pick her jaw up off the floor as her wife kept her smirk. A few condescending pats on her cheek snapped her out of it as her wife stepped around her. She flinched, rubbing her cheek as her wife disappeared into the closet, coming back with Rio’s black cargo pants and black long sleeve. She dropped them in her arms before fetching a wool green flannel. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And your green Doc Martens will do, love,” her wife kissed her cheek before disappearing back inside. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t stop the soft smile, as her tongue prodded the side of her cheek. She got dressed, pulling her hair up in a tail as she did her eye liner in their bathroom. Just as she was about finished, she heard a groan from their room. Panic sinking in for a moment, she rushed out, finding her wife laying on her back with her legs dangling off the bed. The new purple turtleneck sweater fit her beautifully, but her black jeans now sat around her waist unbuttoned. She chuckled softly, sitting next to her wife who was covering her face with her hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s wrong, </span>
<em>
<span>mi vida</span>
</em>
<span>?” she asked sweetly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife peaked an eye at her, seeing her smirk. Agatha swatted at her lightly, refusing to sit up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“They don’t fit,” her wife mumbled into her hands. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio couldn’t help but laugh, her fingers tracing light, soothing circles over the soft skin beneath Agatha’s sweater, “</span>
<em>
<span>Cariño, </span>
</em>
<span>I just bought you new pants that will fit.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife rolled her eyes even though Rio couldn’t see it, “Yeah, but these jeans make my ass look good.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hummed in agreement, her hand trailing lower to squeeze Agatha’s hip, “Your ass always looks good, </span>
<em>
<span>cariño</span>
</em>
<span>. But I distinctly remember buying you a pair of jeans that you can button.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed, her hands dropping to rest over hers, “You’re enjoying this way too much.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am enjoying you, my love,” she corrected, her hands slipping further underneath the sweater. “And our </span>
<em>
<span>pequeño.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife tried to hide her smile, but Rio caught the way her blues sparkled up at her. She smiled down at her, placing a quick kiss on her nose before finding the brand new jeans she bought last week. Her wife was still lying there. She didn’t speak, reaching forward and taking her wife’s pants off of her. Her wife raised an eyebrow, sitting up in surprise as Rio gently pulled them off. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Love, I can do it. You don’t–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio simply kissed her, silencing her as she kneeled down before her, “I know, but I want to.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife’s cheeks grew a bright shade of pink as she kissed the side of her knee, grabbing the new ones and pulling them up her legs. Rio’s heart was beating steady, a calm sense surrounding her as she felt nothing but love for the woman in front of her. It was a simple, intimate gesture, and sure they have helped each other zip up a dress countless times, or tie the back a swimsuit, or dress each other for bed after too many drunken nights, or even the hundreds of times they have undressed each other– Rio felt for some reason this was more than that. Something strengthened their connection as she stood, kissing her wife’s lips before pulling away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Should I pack your craving food, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>?” she asked softly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The tips of her wife’s ears were pink as she nodded. Rio smiled, kissing her lips again before making her way out into the kitchen. She grabbed her wife’s goldfish and pretzels, sealing them in a bag before cutting up some fruit just as her phone buzzed. </span>

</p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled at that, rolling her eyes as she packed her wife’s purse with the snacks– her wife’s purse that she would be carrying. Rolling her eyes, she unpacked her essentials, putting them in her backpack. Just as she shoved their wallets inside, her wife came out of their bedroom. Her hair was pulled up in a bun, a blue heavy long coat framed her body well enough. In her hands was a black scarf that her wife quickly wrapped around her neck. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>. Do you have your gloves and scarf?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife nodded, picking up their keys to Rio’s truck. Rio raised an eyebrow. They usually took Agatha’s black Subaru everywhere. Rio used her truck for her in the summer during their camping trips, if the winter was bad enough and for skiing (which they both were taking the year off from) and their vacations. Rio herself used it when she was chopping wood in the backyard for the fireplace. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Already in your truck, now, </span>
<em>
<span>vámonos</span>
</em>
<span>!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled lightly, following her wife to the garage where she slid in the passenger seat. She sat back, her hand across the dial on her wife’s thigh as she drove, humming to Rio’s heavy metal playlist as Rio stared out into the world. All the houses were already decorated for Christmas and her and Agatha had yet to decorate for Yule. Rio was working on their wreath in the greenhouse, along with her mistletoe. Agatha was already prepping the altar, the candles bringing a comforting scent into the home. Rio was researching cleansing rituals for her wife and the baby. They were still planning the dinner but to their luck, Lilia was going to bring the Yule ham. She sighed, realizing everything they still had to do between the holiday, the baby, and her sisters. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“My love, you’re thinking very loudly.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She hummed her response, not tearing her eyes away from the large blow-up Grinch decoration in a drive-way. She felt her wife’s hand in hers, making her look at her. Her wife’s eyes were still on the road, but there was a softness there reserved for her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“My love, what if you invite your sisters over for dinner in a couple nights instead of telling them during the party?” her wife then chuckled. “Mm, maybe Maria won’t even come this year.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She chuckled as well, slightly hoping it was the case, “That would be nice. I think Oriana is arriving tomorrow. I don’t know when Maria will be here.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>Vidal? You haven’t told me if she is flying out this year.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled softly, thinking of the woman who raised her, “I think she is. I haven’t heard from my cousin Elio. Normally, he texts me updates with </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She watched as her wife smiled faintly, “I hope so. I can already imagine her freaking out realizing she is getting a great-grandbaby.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>This time Rio laughed, not able to stop the image in her head from filling her with such warmth, “</span>
<em>
<span>Mi amor, </span>
</em>
<span>if she comes this year, she is going to be all over you. She isn’t going to let you do anything other than rest. Oh, and she might talk you into a home birth, just warning you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at her for a moment, her eyes wide before turning back to the word, “What? Why?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She chuckled, running her hand through her hair as she leaned back in her seat, “Apparently, </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>delivered me and my siblings before our mother took us to the hospital. She’s a big firm believer in the natural way of doing things– being more connected with nature. So, she will also be talking to you about feeding naturally. You don’t have to tell her if you’re using formulas, just let her talk.” </span>
</p><p><span>She offered sweetly, remembering the countless corrections Rio and her sisters had for not doing things in the way nature intends. So, she was surprised when </span><em><span>Abuelita </span></em><span>didn’t even blink when she was caught with another woman in her bed. She had merely commented that love was natural, why should she care who Rio loved as long as she was happy– a huge difference from what her mother-in-law believed. But to </span><em><span>Abuelita</span></em><span>?</span> <span>Loving was a part of what nature intended and when they got married, her first words to Rio was when she and Agatha would have her great-grandchild. </span></p><p>
<span>As much as her sisters cared less, Rio found comfort in the natural order of life. Her grandmother had taught her from a young age what it meant to live and what it meant to die. So, when her parents died, she wasn’t overly upset. Sure, she missed them, but she understood, but that was also where Maria’s hate came from. Maria, the oldest and twelve at the time, was a wreck when </span>
<em>
<span>mami </span>
</em>
<span>and </span>
<em>
<span>papi</span>
</em>
<span> died that night. Rio was eight and with them when it happened. She couldn’t remember it well, but she remembered a firefighter blocking her path into the burning hotel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had a basketball tournament in San Juan– it was playoffs and Rio remembered sneaking out of the hotel to meet up with the team to get late night ice cream. It was Rio’s idea, as her parents were already asleep and the rest of the team was staying in nearby hotels, a little scattered. But Rio, the ever rebellious and resilient child managed, walking down the streets with her team before returning to sirens and firefighters surrounding the burning building. She didn’t know what happened after. Only trying to go into the hotel when a firefighter had caught her. The rest of it was blurry and she didn’t remember any of it, only the funeral in which she just sat there, unable to cry. She wondered if it was trauma, but Rio didn’t react to fires, hotels, or even hospitals. They were part of the natural order and sometimes shit just happened. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Sometimes people die.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think I want to,” her wife broke her from her thoughts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She sat up, looking over at her, seeing the shyness creeping around her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mm, what?” she asked, shaking her head to focus. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife shot her a quick look before stating, “I think I do– want to breastfeed I mean.”</span>
</p><p>
<span> Rio glanced over at her wife, both of their hands entwined lightly on her belly as the car hummed along the road. The street lights flickered past in a rhythmic glow, illuminating Agatha’s face in soft, golden light. She had one hand on the wheel, her fingers tapping idly as she focused on the road ahead. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You do?” Rio finally asked, her voice gentle but laced with curiosity. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, eyes never leaving the road. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I mean, if I can. I know it’s not always easy, and I don’t know how it’ll go, but…” she exhaled, gripping the steering wheel a little tighter before finally stealing a glance at Rio. “I think I want to try. I like the idea of it. Of that connection.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt warmth spread through her chest, and squeezed her hand lightly in hers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Mi amor, </span>
</em>
<span>that’s beautiful,” she murmured. “And whatever happens, we’ll figure it out. No pressure, no stress. Just what feels right for you and our baby.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed, but Rio could see the small, pleased smile tugging at her lips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita</span>
</em>
<span> will be thrilled,” she admitted with a chuckle. “She’ll probably try to give me some old herbal remedies to help.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, without a doubt.” Rio laughed, rubbing her thumb in slow circles against Agatha’s belly, “You should’ve seen the teas she made for my aunts when they had their babies. Some of them smelled awful, but apparently, they worked.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked, “I’ll take the teas. Just don’t let her try to convince me to have the baby in a river or something.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted, “I’ll do my best.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Silence filled the car once more as the snow started twirling down. Rio watched the flakes before eyeing her wife sharply when she pulled her hand out of Rio’s. Her wife reached for the radio, changing Rio’s playlist. She chuckled as “Baby, It’s Cold Outside” came on, filling the car with the opening notes. Agatha’s fingers hovered over the skip button, ready to change the song. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eyes on the road, Harkness,” Rio slapped her hand away, a playful smile tugging at her lips knowing very well what her wife was capable of. “I want to hear you sing, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor.</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife shot her look, rolling her eyes, “Seriously, Rio? What are we? In a Hallmark movie?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, shaking her head at her wife as her eyes sparkled with amusement. She leaned over, giving her wife the best pleading look she could manage, knowing she would crack. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please, my love. You know how your voice makes me fall in love with you all over again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife groaned, but her fingers were already moving away from the controls. Rio hummed with excitement, the mischief in her eyes turning to adoration as her wife cleared her throat, obviously getting ready to sing for her, but she knew her wife was trying to play it off. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Laying it on thick, Vidal. Flattery will get you nowhere.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head, sitting up in her seat, “I’ll sing it with you– </span>
<em>
<span>por favor, mi amor.</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife eyed her from the corner of eye, but Rio already saw the cracks deepening, “Rio–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She cut her off, “Our little one will love it!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Without another word, Rio slid her hand into her wife’s, and as the music played on, she began to sing, her voice low and playful, mimicking the lyrics as she wiggled her eyebrows at her. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I really can’t stay… but baby, it’s cold outside.”</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>A soft smile tugged on her wife’s lips, but she acted annoyed as her sweet voice filled the car, easily taking over Rio’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span> </span>
<em>
<span>“I’ve got to go away… but baby, it’s cold outside.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes sparkled with delight as she sang along, listening to the smoothness of her wife’s voice. It wasn’t that Rio couldn’t sing, but her wife was like a siren compared to her. She would never forget the first time she had heard her at a karaoke bar singing “Shallow” and how Rio almost fell to her knees the moment her girlfriend-at-the-time kept her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She latched onto the warmth of her wife’s voice mixing with her own as they continued the back and forth, laughing in between. The lyrics danced between them, their voices blending effortlessly </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>This evening has been… so very nice,”</span>
</em>
<span> Rio’s voice softened with affection, glancing over at Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I’ll hold your hands, they’re just like ice,”</span>
</em>
<span> her wife replied, her voice light and teasing, turning her head to smile at Rio before returning her focus to the road. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed and leaned over slightly, still singing as she moved closer, </span>
<em>
<span>“My mother will start to worry…”</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Beautiful, what’s your hurry?” </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha tilted her head, the smile still on her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The duet continued, their voices blending and filling each other with a warmth like no other. With every note, Rio felt more connected to her wife in a strange way. She didn’t always sing, she preferred catching her wife humming or singing to herself when she thought no one was listening. Her favorite was when they would watch a movie together and her wife would sing along with the musical whether it was </span>
<em>
<span>Les Misérables, The Phantom of the Opera, </span>
</em>
<span>or even </span>
<em>
<span>Wicked.</span>
</em>
<span> She had even tried to get her wife to sing at their wedding party, even planning a karaoke set up, but her wife shut that down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As they finished the final lines together, both of them laughing softly, Rio couldn’t help but lean over, pressing a kiss to Agatha’s cheek. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was perfect,” Rio whispered, her voice filled with affection. “I love hearing you sing.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grinned, her cheeks flushed from the warmth of their shared moment. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re lucky I love you,” she teased. “But… I kind of enjoyed that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, her hand once again resting on Agatha’s belly, a quiet, contented smile on her face, “Good. Because we’re doing it again next time. Plus, I think he’ll like it when he can finally hear.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, shaking her head, but there was no denying the warmth between them, both in the car and in their hearts. </span>
</p><p align="center">
<strong>***</strong>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha turned off the road, onto a gravel one, Rio knew immediately where her wife was taking her. It was to the Yule market where a village would pop up like magic right before the holiday with trinkets to buy like candles, sun and moon ornaments, fresh wreaths and mistletoes, yule trees, statues of goats, and Rio’s favorite, the food: venders of wassail, Yule log cakes, gingerbread, nuts, berries, beef stews, and so much more. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But something made her uneasy. Tonight was the opening night, which meant college students would surely be filled here. It was all too easy; she knew that they would run into their students. At least their co-workers were at the mixer, but that still didn’t settle her. Her wife must have known her thoughts as she took her hand, kissing the top of her knuckles.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s okay, my love. We both knew our secret was going to come out sooner or later.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart skipped a beat as Agatha spoke those words, and for a moment, it felt as if the weight of the entire world had shifted. Her instinct was to pull back, to keep the secret a little longer. But Agatha’s calm, unwavering confidence settled over her like a warm blanket. As much as she wanted to protect her wife, to shield her from looks and gossip, Yule was the perfect time for new beginnings– fresh starts. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve been ready for the gossip to stop, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor. </span>
</em>
<span>But, with how nosy this group is– I don’t want them saying anything more about you,” she murmured, glancing out the window at the small flickering candles that decorated the parking lot of the market. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then, let them talk, my love,” her wife hummed, her thumb brushing circles over the back of Rio’s hand. “Plus, I think if it’s out now, by the time we get to the next semester, the excitement will have died down.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>They both fell quiet as her wife rolled down the window, talking to one of the people directing traffic. Her wife was pointed closer to the pines that were growing in neat rows, people already running through them and picking their trees. Rio let out a breath, calming her nerves at her wife’s words. She had a point, and they wouldn’t have to hear the gossip anymore. They could just be together– Rio could watch her wife bloom with life over the month and a half break and it be just them… just in a place for them… </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife backed the truck into a space and placed it in park before turning to her. Rio watched as her eyes sparkled with that familiar gleam– one Rio had fallen for all those years ago. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Besides, I want to spend tonight with you, my love. Walk the market, start picking our decorations, and for you to pick the last Yule tree before I take over for the next three years,” Agatha smirked at her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised an eyebrow, “I don’t think so, Mrs. Harkness-Vidal. The Vidal genes are stronger than you realize. You </span>
<em>
<span>will </span>
</em>
<span>be losing both bets, my love.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife rolled her eyes, “I am carrying the kid, darling–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tutted, “Yeah, with my bone-sperm–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head, a gleam in her eye, “Do I need to remind you what you were like after sedation?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio scowled at that, remembering her wife laughing at her once she was fully conscious in their home. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio grumbled as a light poked at her eyes. Her eyes felt too heavy, like they were fighting her brain from wanting to wake up, but there was something that was telling her to wake up. A gentle, angelic voice calling to her. She hummed for a moment, not understanding where she was– and for a moment she figured she was dead with this beautiful voice above her. Fingers brushed through her hair before cupping her cheek. She instinctively leaned into the touch, the grounding warm touch that triggered her eyes to open. She squinted, finding chestnut hair spilling over someone’s shoulders, and the light behind them, made their hair shine. It was like a soft halo crowning her head and Rio slowly took in how long and thick the chestnut locks were. Her eyes followed the waves up to a pale beautiful face and Rio felt like her mouth dry. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Her cheekbones were sharp, her jawline must have been carved by the gods above and that adorable dimpled chin. Her lips were plump and a pale pink that were curved in a soft smile, a smile looking down at her as if she were the world. She blinked again, moving up to that nose– oh, it was cute. And then, Rio’s heart stopped. Her eyes grew wide as she met cerulean blue– a blue that was cleaner than any river in Switzerland– not that she had been there… had she been there? They were electric, something enticing– something that put a spell on her and for a moment, she almost fell for– what she decided– this witch. That’s what she had to be, the way she was trying to lure her in. This person was nothing but a predator staring down at her prey, ready to take her life for her own.  </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio weakly smacked the hand off of her. Her arms flared out, trying to push the witch away, but it was a weak attempt as hands wrapped around her wrists, stilling her as the witch’s lips moved as if speaking to her. She only blinked again, squinting as if she made her eyes work better, then she could hear better. She stilled and the hands dropped her wrists, moving to cradle her face as the woman sat on the bed next to her. It was then, the sound rolled in like the slow rolling waves of an ocean coming to greet you. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Sweetheart, it’s time to get up, okay?” the witch spoke, the waves tugging at her feet, trying to lure her in closer.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio tilted her head as one hand remained on her face, a thumb brushing her cheek as the other held her hand. She blinked slowly again, unsure how to approach the witch. She was so fucking beautiful– like something out of one her dreams. It was almost unfair as she could barely put words to the etherealness above her. But one realization hit her hard. She was married. She had a wife… somewhere… someone married her, but it couldn’t be this beauty. And Rio Vidal was a respectful, loyal woman. So whatever this witch had planned for her, it wouldn’t work.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She slapped at the hands again, “You’re…you’re like really pretty– like really really really pretty” her voice slurred “but I-I… have a wife, querida.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The witch cladded in purple and black laughed– perhaps in a loving manner as she took Rio’s wrists again, “I am your wife, my love.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio blinked. And then again for good measure because that was all she could do as the witch slowly morphed into an angel again, the halo crowning her rightfully as Rio felt her jaw go slack. She lifted her hand, reaching weakly to touch her face but ultimately failed, leaning back into the pillows.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Wifey…” she murmured and Agatha put her hand to her mouth, seeming to cover her laugh.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She nodded, a smile still shining, “Yes, my love. I am your wife.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Before Rio could respond, she jumped to the sharp scrape of metal and the fluttering of curtains flapping together. A nurse came in with pink scrubs and Rio scrunched up her nose. It didn’t make sense why there was another person with them. Why couldn’t they just leave her and this goddess– well she guessed if the woman said she was her wife, who was she to question it. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“How are you feeling, Mrs. Rio Harkness-Vidal. You still seem a little out of it.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She grumbled out something but felt her eyes be drawn back towards the witch beside her. She couldn’t stop the smile that stretched her face as she took in the sight before her. Yep, this was definitely the last thing she wanted to see before she promptly kicked the bucket.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“How did it go?” the witch asked the nurse and Rio flared her nostrils. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She didn’t like the witch paying attention to someone else. She felt something inside her, a need to turn the witch back to her. She couldn’t understand why another woman was talking to her if she was hers. She tried sitting up, to tell this random bitch off, but the room immediately spun. She groaned but then the hand was there, on her shoulder and holding her in place. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Doctor said the procedure went great. They were able to scrape enough bone marrow to use as sperm and we can begin the next phase next week. You can make an appointment up front once she’s a little more awake.”</span>

<span>Rio tugged at her wife’s arm and met worried blue eyes. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She tried flashing a smile at her, reaching her arms out and moving her fingers in a grabbing motion, “Hug mm… huggie.”  </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio snapped out the faint memory, grumbling to herself. She didn’t remember much else of it, but apparently Rio had tried to flirt with her wife when they were in the car. And that then led to something about her tongue being involved. Agatha wouldn’t let her hear the end of it for weeks, especially seeing Rio’s rare softer side. And even now, she brought it up every now and then to win an argument.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned her head away, muttering soft curses under her breath as she adjusted the scarf around her neck, but ultimately melted when she felt warm lips against her cheek. They got out of the truck, Rio coming around and fixing her wife’s scarf before handing her gloves. Before her wife could drag her off, she wrapped her arms around her waist, pulling her closer as Agatha’s nose was already growing the slightest shade of pink from the cold. She kissed her lips slowly, pressing her warmth and love into her wife, feeling her fall into her embrace. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you, my love. For doing this, I mean,” she murmured against her lips, her head tilted down due to the heeled boots. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife smiled at her, her eyes meeting hers as her breath was hot against her mouth as she spoke, “You have dealt with enough, my love. You deserve this– we deserve this.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>With that, Rio placed another fleeting kiss to her lips, leading her into the entrance of the market. The Yule market was alive with activity, a blend of voices and laughter swirling in the crisp winter air. Rows of wooden stalls stretched across the square, their roofs dusted with snow and adorned with twinkling fairy lights. Garlands of pine and holly draped across their edges, tiny golden bells tied into the branches jingling softly whenever the wind picked up. Vendors had decorated their stalls with wreaths and lanterns, their warm glow casting flickering shadows on the hay covered ground. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The scent of roasted chestnuts, cinnamon, and mulled wine wrapped around them like a comforting embrace, mingling with the fresh pine from the trees scattered around the square. Somewhere in the distance, the sound of a violin played a soft, cheerful tune, adding to the enchantment of the evening. Rio wrapped her arm around her wife’s waist, guiding her through the bustling crowd. The food stalls were calling to her, their aromas thick in the chilly air, but before she could make her way over, Agatha lightly tugged on her sleeve. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll get us wassail,” she said, already glancing toward a vendor lined with wooden barrels, steam rising from the large cauldrons where the spiced drink was being ladled into mugs. “And yes, my love, I know. No alcohol.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” Rio nodded, taking off her backpack and handing her wife her wallet, “And I’ll get us food. You know, the important part.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, but there was warmth in them as she let go of her wife’s sleeve and drifted toward the cider stand. With her hands now free, Rio made her way toward the food section, already eyeing a stall selling roasted nuts glazed in honey and cinnamon. Across from it, another vendor arranged fresh-baked bûches de Noël, their scents mingling with the smoky aroma of sizzling sausages and golden tartiflettes. But before she could take another step, something caught her eye– a flash of a lighter green among the reds and golds of a nearby booth. She turned her head, her feet already moving on their own as she approached the stall. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Nestled among soft woolen scarves and hand-knitted socks was a section full of baby clothes, and a onesie hung among the rest. Rio took it down, her hands moving over the soft, thick wool of the onesie. It was perfect for winter with delicate little embroidered leaves on the collar and holly berries decorating throughout. Something inside her clenched, warmth spreading through her heart as she turned to the tag, finding it was for a baby that was at least eight months old. She felt a soft smile take over her face as she couldn’t will herself to put it back. Her child wasn’t even born yet, but she could already picture them wearing it, small and snug in her wife’s arms. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could even try to reason with herself she didn’t need to buy it, an old woman approached, her smile tender and her eyes bright with the candles that surrounded them, “Do you want that wrapped, dear?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She nodded quickly, but quickly found her voice. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, please,” she murmured, her fingers reluctantly letting go of the onesie as the old woman took it from her hands. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You must be expecting a little one soon,” the woman said kindly, carefully wrapping the onesie in soft brown paper tied with twine. “How far along are you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled, a rare softness in her expression. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“My wife is carrying our little one,” she corrected, but it wasn’t with the usual irritation. “Our baby is due in May.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The old woman’s eye lit up with interest as she set the package into a green tote bag. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“A spring child,” she mused, nodding approvingly. “Blessed by Betlane’s warmth and the turning of the wheel.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Rio could ask how much, the woman turned, sorting through the wooden drawers behind her counter. She frowned slightly as she watched the woman collect bundles of dried herbs and small vials of oil. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you—?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hush now, dear,” the woman said, gently but firmly. “You young mothers always think you don’t need looking after. But a mother and her child deserve all the protection they can get.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared, her mouth hanging open, startled. The woman turned back around with a small cloth pouch and bundle of tiny herbs in jars. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This,” she held up the pouch, “is an anointing oil– made with rosemary, lavender, and myrrh. Draw protection symbols on your wife’s belly, especially during full moons. It will strengthen the bond between mother and child and protect her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She put in the tote bag and reached for the jars of herbs, “These are also protective. Hang them above your door, burn a little in the evening, and add some to her baths. Sage for cleansing” she held the jars up one by one as she named them “mugwort for dreams, and rose petals for love. Now, it’s only fifteen for the onesie.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio reached for her cash, pulling out more, “No, please. Allow me to pay for the oils and herbs too–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman clicked her tongue, waving a hand, “It is a gift, dear. From an old mother to a new one.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head, a small laugh escaping her as her head dipped in gratitude, “Thank you. Happy solstice.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“May your little one be born under the blessed stars.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She took the bag, thanking her once again, before turning and heading to the food. She picked up some tartiflette before grabbing two bowls of stew and searching for her wife with the tray in her hands. She ended up finding a table, setting their things down and pulling out her phone. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<b>Mi amor💜 : </b>
<span>The line is long and they messed up on my order. Got gingerbreads too! </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="right">
<span>Found a table at the end of the food section </span>
<b>:Me</b>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>Rio blew at the stew in front of her, her phone on the table waiting to see if her wife could find her when a familiar figure made her stop. She turned, spotting a tall man with strawberry blonde hair. He wrapped his scarf tightly around him, carrying a tray of food himself before spotting her. He smiled, moving quickly towards the table. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dr. Vidal,” he said cheerfully. “Skipping the mixer too?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She swore in her head, feeling her professional façade slipping into place as he sat the tray down on the table, rubbing his hands together.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>She nodded her head slowly, “Yes, figured I could use some air to breathe, Professor Vision.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The rush of anxiety flooded her as she glanced around for her wife. This wasn’t how this was supposed to go. Tonight was for her and her wife, away from work life and here was the physics professor she had hired recently, approaching her without fear. She straightened up, trying to ease the pounding in her heart and keeping herself from biting at her cheek. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I swear if this fucker asks if I am pregnant–</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Please, Vision is fine. I must say, I am so sorry to hear all the rumors about you. It must be overwhelming, especially as the dean.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She glanced at her phone, swallowing the tension that set in her jaw, “Yes, but um– why are you here? And not at the mixer?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Wanda</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She took a deep breath, taking the cold air to help ease the overwhelming sensation of everything eating at her. She couldn’t handle the thought of seeing Agatha tonight, as much as it was the plan to talk to her– to apologise, any thought of Rio Vidal made her want to throw up. The rumors grew worse, and it wasn’t entirely her fault. All she wanted to do was stir trouble for Vidal, but no, the professors decided to take it in a whole new direction. She had walked in on that Friday morning hearing endless whispers that Agatha wasn’t there. As the day drew on, the whispers grew louder. The Dean was absent too, both of them were absent without notice. And then came the rumors, crawling through the department like an infestation of rats and spread like the fleas they carried. The plague hit Wanda hard, and she couldn’t shake the guilt that clouded her. From Agatha and Rio being married, to her own rumor that she started with Rio being pregnant– and now she had dragged Agatha into it in the worst possible outcome. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha Harkness was sleeping through the faculty and taking advantage of the pregnant Dean. It was ridiculous and something that Agatha Harknes would be the last person to even try, and the thought of Agatha wanting to touch Rio in </span>
<em>
<span>any</span>
</em>
<span> way made her sick further. Vision had shown up to her apartment with roses and a warm smile, his cheeks pink from the cold. It was endearing, but it still didn’t ease her nerves. It was </span>
<em>
<span>her </span>
</em>
<span>fault now that Agatha was now the center of a scandalous and completely untrue rumor. Rio Vidal was nothing but a friend to Agatha, and it was only purely coincidence that they both were absent that day… right? </span>
</p><p>
<span>She shrugged her shoulders back, rolling her neck in a circle as she settled herself. Tonight, she could forget and be present on this date. Vision was a wonderful man. Agatha was married… </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Stop thinking of her.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Vision was sweet, funny, and sure a little awkward, but he was cute. He made her heart flutter in a nice way. And he was understanding. They had called before he came to pick her up for the mixer and he must have heard her hesitate. He had simply offered to take her somewhere else, make it a real date and Wanda had agreed. So, that was how she found herself at the Yule market, away from her hosting duties with a simple text to Crawford and Lune that she was sick. They could manage without her, in fact, they had been running the whole thing without her. They rarely listened to her ideas and it wasn’t like the dean was going to listen to her either. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda smiled as she grabbed their beverages from a man, thanking herself for wearing gloves as the heat radiated through the wool, seeming to already want to burn her. Vision had said he would meet them at the nearby tables, hoping to find one open. She looked around, over the crowds of people carrying endless bags of goods and sweets. She smiled softly, the smell of cinnamon calming her senses as she quickly spotted him. His back was turned and seemed to have found a table. She put on her best smile, forgetting all about work as she weaved herself around the people. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Just as she was about to reach them, she ran into someone, almost spilling their drinks, but she held them out, keeping the scorching liquid steady as the passenger-by mumbled out a weak apology. She groaned, looking up but this time she noticed Vision was talking to someone. She stepped to the side, trying to see who it was and the sight made the blood dissipate from her body. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They stood apart by a table, a tray placed in front of each of them. Her eyes narrowed to the large dish of potatoes with melted cheese and bacon to the two bowls of stew before moving up the woman. Her winter coat was black and underneath the signature colour of green, a thick wool flannel. Her eyes continued, reaching the face of the Dean… the dean who was supposed to be at the mixer. Wanda’s mind raced, each heartbeat thundering louder than the bustling crowd around her. This couldn’t be… she had avoided the mixer to avoid </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span>… the woman who had done nothing but ruin her life </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio Vidal, a picture of perfect grace and power, standing at the table with Vision. The two were deep in conversation and she watched as Vision motioned his hands around as he spoke. It made her stomach twist. Tonight, it was just supposed to be him and her… but no, Vidal had to ruin not only professional life, but her personal life. Irritation flooded her, the heat in chest intensifying as she stood frozen in place. Her thoughts were sharp, cutting her as she watched Vidal’s somehow relaxed demeanor. It wasn’t as cold, as harsh, but she still demanded respect– but yet they spoke as equals, even Vidal cracking a small smile. Vision’s easy, relaxed smile contrasted with the sharp edges of Wanda’s thoughts. All she knew was this had to be a joke. This couldn’t possibly be happening, but the more she shook her head, reached for the heat in her hands to wake her up, the more Vidal was there, speaking kindly with Vision… and for some reason, it felt personal– more than her just being an insufferable boss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda held the drinks tightly in her hands, her pulse quickening as she watched the way Rio gestured animatedly, flicking the raven curtain bangs out of her face as she leaned on the table and fixed the tote bag on her shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>What’s so special about her?</span>
</em>
<span> Wanda thought bitterly. </span>
<em>
<span>She is nothing but a cold-hearted bitch. Why is Vision so at ease with her? </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Her gaze shifted back to Rio, a flicker of something she couldn’t quite identify stirring inside her. Was it envy? Or was it something deeper? Something darker? As much as she wanted to avoid these thoughts, she couldn’t. She hated Vidal. She hated her face, her stupid smirk, the rise of an eyebrow, the power she carried, the way she had something with Agatha that Wanda didn’t– if it wasn’t for Rio Vidal, her life would be perfect… well, minus that Agatha was married. But it was fine, because even then she could have at least had the woman as a friend– fuck, she would have had friends at work if it wasn’t for Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her grip tightened, </span>
<em>
<span>And people really thing that fucking woman is one being taken advantage of? She is obviously taking advantage of Agatha. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Just as she was about to step forward, probably about to do something that would end her career, a figure out of the corner of her eye caught her. Like a magnet, her eyes were drawn behind Vidal. Her blood came rushing back, but this time her heart dropped. Her feet carried her forward unsteadily as she watched as Agatha Harkness came beside Rio, smiling so softly at her.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>No</span>
</em>
<span>, she thought, her breath catching. </span>
<em>
<span>Not now. Please, not now.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The truth that had been gnawing at her since the rumors first started felt so much sharper in the moment. Her mouth opened and closed, not a single sound being made as Rio’s arm wrapped around Agatha’s shoulders, pulling her closer. And then, Agatha leaned into it, a smile lighting up on her face as they turned back to Vision. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As her feet carried her closer, she almost dropped the drinks, “</span>
<em>
<span>Mi amor–”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Mi amor… my love? </span>
</em>
<span>her mind raced, not fully understanding the weight of the words until Rio continued. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is Vision. The new physics professor. Vision, this is my wife, Dr. Agatha Harkness.” </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Wife?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Wife.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“…this is my wife, Agatha Harkness.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda couldn’t speak. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Wife.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t breathe. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Wife</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t move.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda stood there, feeling every breath catch in her throat as the weight of the words hit her. </span>
<em>
<span>Wife</span>
</em>
<span>. The word clung to the air between them, thick and suffocating. She couldn’t even begin to process the whirlwind of emotions that flooded her– rage, confusion, bitterness– all wrapped around a core of deep, undeniable hurt. Her gaze remained fixed on Agatha, the woman she had admired, the one who had unknowingly drawn her in with just a glance. But now, in this moment, that admiration was twisted into something darker. Wanda’s mind was reeling, the anger welling up in her chest, each thought sharper than the last. She’s married to Vidal. To Rio fucking Vidal. It felt like a cruel punch to her gut, a sharp reminder that all her unspoken feelings, all her yearnings, had been for nothing. Agatha was gone, claimed, and the world she had imagined in her head– the one where Agatha might look at her, smile at her, even just talk to her– was a fantasy that had been shattered by the cold reality of the woman’s </span>
<em>
<span>real</span>
</em>
<span> relationship with Rio Vidal. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lovely to meet you, Agatha,” Vision’s voice broke through the haze in Wanda’s mind, a bright and welcoming tone that contrasted with the storm brewing inside her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She watched, almost in slow motion, as Vision reached out to shake Agatha’s hand, his polite, unaware smile spreading across his face. Wanda’s stomach twisted painfully at the sight of it, feeling every discomforting ripple like it was an electric shock. Agatha, ever composed, smiled warmly at Vision, returning the handshake with ease. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The pleasure’s mine,” she said, her voice smooth, her presence radiating confidence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But even in the midst of that calm, Wanda could see the subtle way Agatha leaned into Rio, the quiet connection between them that no one could miss. Wanda felt as if she were watching a scene play out from behind glass, unable to break through the wall that had suddenly formed around her. She had never felt so out of place in her entire life. The man she was on a date with, the woman she had longed for, and the woman she hated with every fiber in her being– now all tangled together in a way she never could have imagined.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could run, before she could hide away from the crumbling world, Vision turned, meeting her gaze with a smile, “Wanda, darling, there you are.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She smiled back and in truth she didn’t know how she did it. She let something take control, a part of her that was an actress, refusing to let it show how much she wanted to lunge across the table or maybe cry or maybe scream or maybe all three. But she would win a Grammy…a Golden Globe? Whatever the fuck it was for this performace. Her smile hurt her cheeks as she stood beside Vision not missing the way Vidal’s jaw clenched or how she seemed to pull Agatha closer against her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Vis,” she smiled up at him, refusing to look at them. “Dr. Vidal, Dr. Harkness, sorry if he was bothering you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Vision laughed but Agatha only gave a fake laugh and Vidal, she barely reacted, tilting her head at Wanda with a look that could kill. Vidal’s jaw was still tight, her gaze never leaving Wanda, as though she could see right through her, sensing the crack in Wanda’s calm façade. Agatha, on the other hand, seemed unfazed. She was still leaning slightly into Rio, her hand brushing against the woman’s arm in a way that made Wanda feel like an outsider, a stranger in a space she once thought she could belong. Agatha’s gaze met Wanda’s for just a moment, and there was a flicker of something there– something that might have been pity, or maybe it was just indifference. Wanda couldn’t tell. All she knew was that it hurt. It hurt so much.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, we should let you two be. It was wonderful to meet you, Dr. Harkness,” Vision said, grabbing the tray as Wanda stayed by his side. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t hear what else was said as they turned, walking back into the crowd. Vision was talking about something to her, but she barely registered it. She looked back over her shoulder, something foolish in her hoping to see if Agatha was looking at her, but she was not. Agatha was looking up at Rio like she was the world– like she was the moon, the stars, the sun, the sea– like she was life incarnate. She was saying something and Rio nodded, a strange warm smile gracing her lips and then it happened. Rio leaned down, Agatha closing the distance, and when their lips met, Wanda staggered. </span>

<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Snow poured from the heavens, smothering the roads, the trees struggling like Atlas to hold up their own weight from the assault. In the distance, a tree failed, crumbling to the ground and taking wires down with it who snapped from the first touch of a branch. Across Westview, candles lit every window, families huddled together inside their homes, telling Christmas ghost stories or setting up their altar for Yule. A few were lucky, powering on their generators to keep the heat while most scrambled to flick on their faucets to keep their pipes from freezing. It was a strange winter– by a strange winter, really a winter the Northeast of the States haven’t seen in years. Decembers of late kept their freezing miserable fall weather, and once or so in January or February, they were gifted a good snow fall to christen the slopes for a semi-good ski day. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The walls of the living room flickered with light from the flames of the fireplace. They danced and bowed with a rhythm befitting the Imperial Russian Ballet, casting a spell to at least warm the single room. The house was already filled with decorations for Yule. A tree stood proudly in the corner, waiting to be decorated. The mantle above the fireplace was lined with holly and sprigs of mistletoe, their vibrant green and red standing out against the deep mahogany of the wood. Garlands of pine draped around the house, along banister in the basement, on the chairs of the dining room and kitchen, its scent filling the air with the unmistakable aroma of winter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>On a nearby small credenza sat their altar for the Triple Goddess and for solstice, Agatha rearranged it with pinecones, evergreen boughs of fir and cedar. Rio had added fennel seeds for new motherhood and inner strength, a single raspberry leaf to symbolize birth, and a strawberry leaf to aid pregnancy. In the center of it, sat a ceramic dish with ashes of bay leaves from their wishes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A tray of cider steamed gently from a coffee table that was pushed to the side, the cinnamon and clove mingling with the woody fragrance of the fire. A plate of gingerbread sat beside it, their icing hard and cold from their journey from the market. On the couch sat a green tote bag, still yet to be revealed of the contents inside and beside it, a small crocheted green blanket with a few purple azaleas still yet to be finished and the needle wrapped in the yarn of wool. In the place where the coffee table should have been sat heaps of blankets and pillows, tangled and ruffled as heavy panting filled the air, another heat setting into the room that wasn’t from the fire. Bodies slid languidly against each other, fitting together with ease as soft breaths and moans slipped along with a small laugh or a simple hum of amusement.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared down into deep brown eyes, watching as her wife kept her eyes with her as she moved. Calloused but soft hands framed her hips, guiding her up and down in a slow deep pace. Sweat formed on their bodies, the fire lighting a golden sheen as Agatha felt every slow drag inside her, filling her over and over again. Her eyes traced down her wife’s face, to her lips and to the black ink on her shoulders. Vines wrapped around her collarbones, an allusion of them seeming to have disappeared into her skin. The phases of the moon were placed right under her breasts and her ribs were done, each a typiction of what lies beneath the skin. The contrasts of blacks and whites making it seem Rio’s ribs were on display. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was so used to them at points that she forgot they were there, but something in her brain triggered her eyes to them. Her eyes flicked to the deep purple azaleas on her wife’s bicep and then to the snake on the other, but Agatha’s favorite was Rio’s back tattoo– the way the black ink would flex with her muscles: an intricate design of the tree of life. The trunk lined with Rio’s spine, subtly made of human skulls, its roots twisted and gnarled at the base of her back, curved into protective runes. The branches danced along her shoulder blades, some leaves, some bare like bone. She was with Rio at every session and Agatha was obsessed ever since. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers moved with deliberate slowness, tracing the edge of Rio’s collarbone, lingering over the tattoos that danced along her skin like an intimate map. Her breath was quick, warm against Rio’s body, but there was a subtle shift in her expression– a slight tightening of her jaw as she tried not to let her gaze wander, knowing her wife would always get smug if her gaze lingered too long. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Too late apparently as her wife chuckled darkly, “Ah, this phase again, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>? Was wondering when that would come back.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head, “What phase?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes sparkled mischievously, a teasing grin curling at the corner of her lips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The one where you’re </span>
<em>
<span>obsessed</span>
</em>
<span> with my tattoos,” she purred, her voice low and sultry, the heat of her words matching the fire that crackled in the background. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers, still resting on Agatha’s hips, tightened slightly, subtly guiding her deeper into their shared rhythm, but it was clear Rio was enjoying the teasing moment. Agatha tried to hide the flush that crept up her neck, but let out a soft moan as her wife pushed the strap a little deeper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not obsessed,” she replied too quickly, though the way her fingers lingered, tracing the designs on Rio’s skin, gave her away. “I’m just… appreciating the artistry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her voice faltered just a little as her gaze flickered back to the intricate design of her ribs. It was impossible not to admire the way they twisted and turned with each movement, lining with her real ribs perfectly. Agatha moved her hands down from her collarbones, steadying herself with her hands splayed over contoured abs, ignoring the wide smirk of her wife as hands moved up and down her sides.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t fool me, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>. You’re practically memorizing every line, every curve. It’s like you can’t get enough.” She sat up, her breath ghosting over Agatha’s ear. “I like it though. You look so damn beautiful when you’re lost in me, in my body.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could feel the heat of her words settling deep within her, and for a moment, her resolve wavered. She could deny it, but it </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> undeniable– the way the tattoos made Rio’s body even more intoxicating, how the ink and skin merged into something almost sacred to her. She shook out of it as she bared her teeth in the way her wife would and pushed her back down. Rio grunted as she landed, her head in the mess of blankets beneath her, black hair fanning out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t get all cocky now, hun,” she curled her lip. “Need I remind you how obsessed </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> were when I got the tattoo on the back of my neck?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The image flashed quickly through her mind, Rio holding her hand as the blood moon was placed at the base of her neck, before flashing to when they got back to their apartment. Rio had Agatha bent over on the bed, fingers roughly in her hair, clearing the view for the tattoo, and pulling her back with every thrust. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife didn’t even blink, “Need </span>
<em>
<span>I</span>
</em>
<span> remind </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> when my back tattoo was finished– fuck, Agatha, you bent me over the counter the moment we got home. I didn’t even realize you were wearing your strap until it was inside me, and the way your ripped my shirt off–”</span>
</p><p>
<span> Agatha leaned down, kissing her wife’s lips to get her to stop talking. Red burned her cheeks as she remembered thoroughly planning it out before leaving to the tattoo studio with Rio. Okay, so she had done that, but who could really blame her when her wife’s back was already hot and then the ink was added– sue her. She did what any other sane woman, any other loving wife would do and bent her wife over their kitchen counter just to watch the way the ink moved with her muscles. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She pressed her hips against her harder drawing a soft moan from her wife and wiping the smugness off her face. When she pulled away, sitting up on and moving up and down in her wife’s lap, Agatha watched as brown eyes trained to her stomach. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She smirked, knowing she could get the last word, “And look who is staring now, all obsessed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>But her wife had other plans.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio only tilted her head, her eyes softening, “Mmm, how could I not, my love? How could I not be obsessed with the mother carrying my child?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hands landed on her stomach before one guiding her to lean forward again, their lips met softly as Agatha melted into her wife. Her heart fluttered at the sudden change of tone, and she couldn’t stop her smile as her hand cupped Rio’s face, pressing her body flush against her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You say the sweetest things sometimes,” she murmured against her lips before attaching them back to hers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hands moved up and down her sides as her pace quickened, but their lips never left. Her tongue swirled with Rio’s as their bodies moved in sync. Hands were in her hair, smoothing it down her back, caressing her shoulders to pull her impossibly closer. Her wife’s tongue dominated hers as she let her moans fall into her mouth without care. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Fingers traced the delicate curve of Agatha’s spine, pressing, mapping, memorizing. Rio’s grip was firm, her touch both grounding and electrifying, a contradiction Agatha had long since surrendered to. She shivered as Rio’s hands roamed, as if she were reading her body like scripture, committing every breath, every twitch, every sigh to memory. Agatha pulled back slightly, her lips swollen, her breath mingling with Rio’s in the space between them. She tilted her head, taking in the way her wife looked beneath her– flushed, dark eyes half-lidded, a lazy, knowing smirk playing at the corners of her mouth. It was </span>
<em>
<span>that </span>
</em>
<span>smirk and Agatha would never tire of it, not that she would admit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re insufferable,” she murmured, dragging a teasing hand down the expanse of wife’s torso, her nails barely scratching over warm skin, over ink and muscle that tensed under her touch.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you love me,” her wife shot back, arching ever so slightly, chasing her touch, her breath hitching when Agatha’s hands settled on either side of her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed, pressing an open-mouthed kiss to the column of Rio’s throat, feeling the way her pulse thrummed beneath her lips. Her hands wandered, learning her all over again, marvelling at how her wife fit so perfectly beneath her, beneath her hands, beneath her lips. Rio exhaled sharply when Agatha bit down, just enough to leave a mark, just enough to make her gasp. Her fingers curled into Agatha’s hair, gripping, pulling, guiding her mouth back to hers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Their kiss was slow but deep, filled with unspoken devotion, with a hunger that burned between them like wildfire. When Agatha pulled back again, her hips still grinding down against her wife’s, she felt a hand back on the side of her stomach, a thumb brushing in circles over the expanse of her naked skin. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re carrying everything I love most in this world,” Rio whispered like it was a precious secret that came from her soul. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath caught. It was always like this with Rio– one moment teasing, the next overwhelming her with the sheer depth of her love, her devotion, her need. She almost didn’t know how to respond, but her lips claimed hers again, her tongue spelled out all the love she didn’t quite know how to put into words. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Their moans entwined in a harmony, hands roaming, sparking against each other’s skin hotter than the fire that burned beside them. Her wife’s hips met her with every thrust, hitting everything inside her as she pulled away from her lips, searching for those rich soil eyes. Agatha never looked away as her brow furrowed, a pressure coiling in her lower stomach. A hand reached up, cupping her cheek tenderly, their foreheads touching, Agatha breathing in Rio’s panting breath. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The lasting eye contact– the way Rio was looking at her like she truly was carrying everything Rio cared about–  made her hips stutter, a loud moan falling from her lips, but she forced her eyes to remain open as Rio’s brow furrowed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” she gasped as the coil finally snapped, a bliss washing over her body as for a moment all she could see was a sea of soil. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She heard her name echo into the house, her wife’s hips arched up into hers as her wife trembled, but the soil remained, their love unearthed. For a moment, Agatha swore she could hear their hearts beating in sync, beating for each other, beating for the life they were making. It was just them and their love before the fire, tangled in the middle of their living room in the middle of a power outage. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She smiled as she felt lazy, lingering kisses to her cheeks, and a final one to her lips before hands were helping her lift off of her. Agatha gasped as the toy slipped out of her, a feeling of emptiness hitting her and it took everything in her not to sink back down. Strong arms guided, her body pressing up against a muscular one, her stomach somewhat resting on Rio’s as her leg hitch up on a thigh. She buried her face into her wife’s neck, smelling that perfect scent of pine and cedar-wood. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Arms wrapped around her, holding her close as they both caught their breath, their chests rising and falling in cadence. Her scalp tingled as fingers brushed through her hair and a hand found its way back to her swollen stomach. Warmth remained inside her as she pressed lazy kissing to the underside of Rio’s jaw, her wife humming in contentment. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love you, Rio,” she whispered over the crackling of the fire. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife’s arms tightened around her, protective, possessive, reverent. She tilted her head slightly, giving Agatha more space to press her kisses, her breath warm against sweat-slicked skin. The firelight flickered, casting golden shadows over them, over the ink winding across Rio’s body, over the curve of Agatha’s stomach where their unborn child lay nestled between them, safe, loved. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A soft hum rumbled from Rio’s chest, deep and satisfied. She turned her head, brushing her lips over Agatha’s temple, then down to her cheek, her nose, until she found her lips again. It was a slow kiss, unhurried and tender, a silent answer to the whispered confession between them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love you too, </span>
<em>
<span>mi vida</span>
</em>
<span>,” she promised against her lips, her voice rough with emotion, with exhaustion, with the quiet certainty of devotion. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, melting further into her wife, her body aching in the most delicious way, her heart brimming with something too vast to name. She traced lazy patterns over Rio’s chest, fingers gliding over muscle and ink, over the heart that beat only for her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She wasn’t sure how long her wife held her like that, her fingers grazing over her stomach and combing through her hair until lips pressed to the top of her head and the body beneath her shifted. She groaned her annoyance but ultimately stood with her wife, but found herself in her arms immediately, searching those brown eyes. They were soft, filled with adoration as they stared back at her. Rio placed a kiss on her forehead, brushing a few strands of hair away from her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll grab new blankets from the basement, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor,</span>
</em>
<span>” her voice was quiet, almost nervous to disrupt the piece. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt the smile back on her face as she reached forward, unbuckling the strap from her wife’s hips, “Your phone’s on the counter. Don’t go in the dark.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The strap fell from Rio’s thighs and she turned, grabbing a candle holder to make her way towards their bedroom. She set the strap aside on the bathroom counter, figuring they would wash it later and using the toilet before walking back out to find her wife just coming back up their stairs with a pile of fresh blankets, her phone in hand as Agatha set down the candle holder on the coffee table. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio spread the blankets out, piling them together until they created a makeshift bed before the fire. Agatha plopped back down, her hands already reaching for the unfinished blanket on the couch cushions. She smiled softly as hands pulled her to lay her back against a warm chest facing the fire, Rio using the front of the couch to hold them up. A comforting silence stretched between them, hands on her stomach as she started to work with only the light from the fire and the candles around them.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha counted the stitches as she went, spinning the fresh wool into an azalea pattern onto the green crocheted blanket she had already begun. Rio had bought her more wool from the market, in fact, she actively had to stop Rio from buying anything Agatha had commented on. It was sweet and so utterly her wife. Her wife bought gifts for their friends, a couple things that she wasn’t allowed to see including the green tote bag she had found on her wife when she was talking to the physics professor– Vincent or Victor– whatever. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Vernon? Vhagar? was kind to her wife and to her surprise her wife, for once, was nice in return. She didn’t bite his head off or scare him away, and when Rio introduced her to him as her wife, Agatha’s heart had swelled with pride. She would never admit it to her wife, but something in her always swam when she was called </span>
<em>
<span>hers</span>
</em>
<span>, when she was called Rio’s. Vito seemed like a kind of man who wouldn’t gossip, so maybe that’s why her wife finally decided to let their secret out, but then her gaze had shifted– bright red hair and wide fearful green eyes staring at them. She had almost laughed– her darling possessive wife always knew how to make a scene. In truth, it was relieving, finally being able to let the redhead know that she was taken, instead of her getting longing looks from the woman like she was a kicked puppy. To the gods it was annoying, and there were multiple times Agatha had sat at their altar, wondering whether or not she should hex the bitch out of spite. She didn’t, knowing their proximity was too close, and she couldn’t afford that negative energy while with child. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lifted her head, surveying their living room. In the corner sat the proud tall Yule tree. Rio had pranced around the tree selection like a love-struck reindeer before she changed, studying the trees like she was sizing them up whether they should be hired to work for her. It took an hour until Rio finally picked their tree, and by then, Agatha wanted to kill her– well, until the little shit opened her mouth and said the tree had to be perfect for the baby. And Agatha had simply melted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She got their bags in the car as Rio and a worker hauled the tree into her truck bed and they were off. When they came home, her wife had yelled at her to sit down while she took care of the tree. She had rolled her eyes, knowing very well she could help her carry it in, but Rio wasn’t having it. So, Agatha for once in her life, didn’t fight her– but not because she wanted to give in to her wife, but because she was hungry and her cravings wanted the fresh roasted chestnuts her wife had bought her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time Rio had managed to set up the tree, pine needles littered the floor. Her wife had tracked in mud and snow, marking up her hardwood floors and staining the carpet. Any other day, Agatha would have been pissed, but she had simply sat back on the couch, finishing the last of the roasted nuts in retaliation. Rio had scowled, but effectively said nothing and began cleaning up the mess she made. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She had made cider while Rio went to the basement again, grabbing their ornaments for the tree when the lights above flickered and fully went out, plunging the house in darkness. She had groaned and heard Rio yell from the stairs as she probably tripped on something. Her wife came up the stairs, marching outside to her greenhouse. Agatha wasn’t in the least bit of surprise, as her wife fussed over her plants in that greenhouse, and once again, Agatha had patted herself on the back for gifting Rio it for their ten year anniversary. As much as Rio was a lovergirl behind closed doors, Agatha could easily match her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>While her wife checked the power in the greenhouse, Agatha had gathered their blankets and placed them in the living room. Soon, Rio came back with an armful of firewood and built them a fire. She had shrugged off her coat and shirt, leaving her in a sports bra, the tattoo moving with her muscles– well, one thing led to another and as much as she wanted to trace her hands over the design while her wife took her, something else wanted Rio inside her. She didn’t know exactly why, but everything in her craved the feeling and she did promise her wife she could sit back and relax– who was Agatha Harkness-Vidal if she didn’t live up to her promises to her wife. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She lost count when lips pressed against her head and she made a slight noise of protest, grumbling slightly as her fingers went back, trying to recount but her wife shifted behind her, reaching for the green tote bag on the couch. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I got you something, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor,</span>
</em>
<span>” Rio’s voice was impossibly soft, and hesitant. </span>
</p><p>
<span>That hesitancy made Agatha freeze, setting the yarn and needle aside. For a moment, she wondered if Rio went against their rules, the number one, most important unspoken rule: don’t acknowledge or celebrate Agatha’s birthday. She hated the way they loomed like an unavoidable storm, the way they curled at the edges of her year, tainting everything in their wake. She hated the way people said “Happy Birthday” with careless ease, as if the words weren’t bitter, as if they didn’t choke her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora had never let her be happy. So, Agatha had stopped counting after a while. What was the point? Every birthday was the same– a quiet reminder that she was an obligation, a mistake, a burden to be shaped into something useful. If she was lucky, Evanora ignored the day entirely, barely sparing her a glance. If she was unlucky, it became another lesson in power, in control, in breaking apart only to be built again in her mother’s image. She remembered the first time she had dared to wish for something– a cake, nothing extravagant, just something sweet, something hers. She had been small, young enough to still believe that birthdays were meant to be celebrated. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora had sneered, “You think you deserve that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And just like that, the idea of birthdays soured, curdled into something ugly, something she wanted nothing to do with. Every year after that was another mark, another tally of survival. That’s all birthdays were– proof that she was still here, despite everything. So no, she didn’t celebrate. She didn’t count down the days. She didn’t let anyone acknowledge it, not even Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio seemed to have sensed that when she was around for Agatha’s birthday. Somehow, Rio knew to treat it like any other day, except Agatha noticed the extra cuddling, the lingering kisses, and if they had made love on that day, how Rio would give and give and give. She quickly realized it wasn’t fully because Rio wanted to celebrate her birthday, it was because Rio wanted to show her how loved she was by her. So, she would let her, just no gifts, no cakes or candles, or even an acknowledgement. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was a different story, and for once, Agatha was happy to plan gifts and surprises for her wife. Her wife was simple, to her luck. A single cupcake to share– or rather a couple of beignets with a few candles and a few gifts she knew her wife would love. Dinner was always to Rio’s favorite Puerto Rican restaurant about two hours away. And sometimes, when they didn’t want to make the drive back, they would book a hotel or motel, and fuck, it was rough, hard, and wild. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife’s birthdays were simple, and something that she wanted to celebrate too. She could just imagine how they would celebrate their little one’s. They would be thoroughly spoiled, Agatha giving them everything she never had as a kid. She would make sure that their kid would always be loved, and she had no doubt that Rio would pull through.</span>
</p><p>
<span>However, Agatha’s own birthday was in twenty one days, December 21st, and seven days before they would find out if they were having a son or daughter. In truth she didn’t care, but it would be a nice late </span>
<em>
<span>Yuletide </span>
</em>
<span>gift for her to win the first bet. There was a secret part of her that was all too ready for this kid to come out as a carbon copy of her wife. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But in this moment, as Rio shifted them, guiding their bodies until they sat face to face– knees bent, hips pressed close, the firelight flickering between them– Agatha felt irritation begin to rise, slow and simmering. She allowed it, let Rio settle them as she pleased, but her silence spoke volumes. Either her wife sensed exactly where her thoughts were headed, or Agatha simply wasn’t hiding her frustration well enough. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A kiss landed against her cheek– soft, a quiet offering– before brown eyes met blue. With a language only they knew, their souls spoke to each other, their love unearthing again as her wife simply reassured her that this was just a gift, not for any particular reason other than she loved her.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just… don’t laugh at me,” Rio murmured, pressing a bag into Agatha’s hands. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She exhaled sharply, but she took it, reaching inside with practiced patience. Her fingers brushed against paper first, the crinkle of it crisp in the warm air. She pulled it free, unwrapping the brown packaging with steady hands. The moment the fabric unfurled, soft green wool pooled in her lap, thick and warm between her fingers. Unbelievably fluffy. She smoothed a hand over it, feeling the intricate stitching, the way the fibers gave way beneath her touch. Her eyes traced the details– dark embroidered leaves curling across the surface, tiny bursts of red holly berries tucked between them like scattered jewels. And then, as she unfolded it further, her gaze caught on the unmistakable shape of two tiny sleeves and the curve of pant legs meant to keep impossibly small feet warm. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers trembled slightly as she ran them over the embroidered leaves, the soft wool warm against her skin. It was too big. Too early. Too much. Her throat tightened, the weight of it pressing against her chest like a hand curling over her ribs. Rio had seen this onesie and thought of their child. Had pictured him– or </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span>– growing into it, wearing it when they were old enough to sit up on their own, to reach out with tiny hands, to look up at them with wide, trusting eyes. It was such a simple thing. Just fabric. Just thread. But it wasn’t. It was proof that Rio already </span>
<em>
<span>knew</span>
</em>
<span> their child, already loved them in the quiet, certain way that she did everything. And Agatha– gods, she </span>
<em>
<span>wanted</span>
</em>
<span> that certainty. But all she could feel was the overwhelming, aching weight of it, pressing down on her with more force than she was ready for. Her vision blurred. </span>
</p><p>
<span>No. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>No</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She would not cry over a stupid onesie. But her hormones had other plans. Her breath hitched, her grip tightening on the soft wool, and she cursed under her breath as she squeezed her eyes shut. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>?” Rio’s voice was soft, careful. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Like she already knew what was happening. Of course she did. Because Rio knew her. Because Rio saw through every wall, every mask, every carefully held breath. A thumb brushed against her cheek, and only then did Agatha realize a single tear had slipped free. Shit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shut up,” she muttered, voice thick, pressing the heel of her palm against her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffed a quiet laugh, “I didn’t say anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You were going to.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, now I’m definitely going to,” Rio teased, though her touch stayed gentle. “It’s okay, you know. You’re allowed to cry.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a watery scoff, shaking her head, “No, I am not. Not over a damn onesie.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned in, pressing a kiss to her temple, “Hormones are a bitch, my love.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sniffed, trying to will the tears back, but her body had already betrayed her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She pressed the onesie against her chest, as if that would somehow ground her, and whispered, “You saw this and thought of them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span> “I did.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You already love them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do,” Rio murmured, no hesitation in her voice. “And so do you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a shaky breath, tilting her head until their foreheads rested together, “I do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s arms wrapped around her then, warm and steady, and Agatha clung to her, onesie crushed between them. She was still overwhelmed. Still hormonal. Still utterly undone by the weight of love pressing against her ribs. Her wife’s lips kept pressing to her head before slowly pulling away, reaching for the bag again. The sound of glass clinking together caught her attention as Rio pulled out a little vial of oil and small bundles of herbs in jars. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The lady I bought the onesie off of gave me these for free. The herbs I was going to lace some to the wreath while others would be used for your baths. She told me this is anointing oil made of rosemary, lavender, and myrrh. She told me to trace protection runes on your stomach and it will also strengthen your connection with them.”</span>
</p><p><span>Agatha stared at the little vial in Rio’s hand, her chest tightening. The warmth of the fire flickered against her skin, but it was nothing compared to the heat curling low in her throat, the kind that came from feeling </span><em><span>too</span></em> <em><span>much</span></em><span> all at once. More tears raced down her cheek but they were simply kissed away. </span></p><p>
<span>“May I?” her wife asked tenderly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed hard, her fingers tightening around the onesie again. It was too much, too soon– wasn’t it? She had barely let herself believe this was real, barely allowed herself to acknowledge the swell of her stomach, the life thrumming beneath her skin. But Rio– Rio had never hesitated. The moment she had shown the positive pregnancy test to her wife, she was all in. She was there holding Agatha through her morning sickness, feeding her food to settle her stomach, and catching her when she felt dizzy. Rio had truly been ready– truly accepted this the moment they started the process. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She exhaled slowly and nodded. Rio’s lips curved into a small, understanding smile. Her wife led her carefully to lay back on the soft pile of blankets, the warmth of the fire kissing her skin, and despite herself, she could feel her body settle into the comfort, her muscles loosening bit by bit. Her wife kneeled over her, uncorking the vial and having the smell of lavender consume her senses. With deliberate, but cautious movements, Rio dipped her fingers into the oil before flingers were sliding against her skin, warming her belly. For a moment she felt exposed, more than just naked in the middle of their living room, but her wife’s fingers brushed over her stomach again, sending a shiver up Agatha’s spine, and she gasped quietly, eyes fluttering shut. Rio’s touch was deifying, the oil now cool against the warmth of her skin, but the soft hum of the fire beside them was all-encompassing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>,” Rio whispered, her voice low and filled with reverence, “</span>
<em>
<span>eres mi vida, mi todo</span>
</em>
<span>.” (You are my life, my everything.) </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled, a light breath escaping her lips as she reached for Rio’s hand, their fingers brushing together before she placed Rio’s palm over her stomach, the warmth of her touch grounding her in the moment. Rio’s thumb traced over her belly, slow and deliberate, and Agatha’s breath caught. She could feel the slight pressure of Rio’s touch, the weight of the love behind it. The oil was still there, cool and comforting, and Rio’s hand stayed steady as she continued to trace the runes, her voice like a sacred chant in the quiet room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Estás protegida,</span>
</em>
<span>” her wife murmured, her lips grazing Agatha’s ear as she continued to trace the first rune. “</span>
<em>
<span>Nada nos hará daño.</span>
</em>
<span>” (You are protected. Nothing will harm us.) </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s chest rose with a deep, shaky breath. The words felt like a spell all on their own, winding around her heart, grounding her in ways she didn’t know she needed. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Te amo,</span>
</em>
<span>” Rio continued, kissing the sensitive skin just below Agatha’s ribs before moving her hand lower, continuing to draw the next rune. “</span>
<em>
<span>Siempre, mi amor.</span>
</em>
<span>” (I love you. Always, my love.) </span>
</p><p>
<span>The sensation of Rio’s hand on her skin, her kisses, and the soft whisper of words in Spanish– their sacredness, the trust Agatha felt in this moment– it all collided into something overwhelming, tender, and raw. Her hands reached for Rio then, her fingers curling into the softness of her wife’s hair as she pulled her closer, desperate for more of this, more of Rio’s presence, more of this love that seemed to be unearthed from her wife’s very soul.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Eres mía,</span>
</em>
<span>” Rio’s voice was barely a whisper, a low sound vibrating their foreheads. “</span>
<em>
<span>y yo soy tuya.</span>
</em>
<span>” (You are mine, and I am yours.) </span>
</p><p>
<span>She shivered, her heart pounding in her chest as she whispered in return, “</span>
<em>
<span>Siempre contigo</span>
</em>
<span>.” (Always with you.) </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s fingers continued their delicate work, tracing the last of the runes over her stomach as she pressed another kiss to the sensitive skin there. It wasn’t long before Agatha’s eyelids grew heavy, the gentle rhythm of Rio’s touch, her soft words, and the warmth of their bodies entwined together lulling her into the safety and peace she hadn’t realized she craved so deeply. She didn’t fight the closing of her eyes as her wife kept whispering to her and to their unborn child, kisses placed against her stomach as all of her worries faded from her mind. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lips were placed on hers before she fully drifted off, listening to Rio capping the vial and rearranging their blankets before stronger arms were pulling her into a place she was sure was safe, and with that– with the comfort of her wife’s love, the warmth and protection she felt from the oil, and the unborn child once more nestled between them, Agatha fell asleep dreaming of their future. </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, stretching slightly, ready to feel the floor beneath her and Rio’s front pressed against her back. She felt neither. She quickly recognized the memory-foam mattress beneath her and her eyes flew open. She rolled on her back, her hand lazily searching for her wife beside realizing she was in bed alone. She tilted her head, confusion settling in as she sat up, her gaze sweeping the room as if that alone could answer her question. The closet light was on, that meant the power was back, but she heard no movement and her wife had a bad habit of leaving it on. Slowly, she swung her legs over the side, her hand going to her stomach as it rumbled, craving her wife’s arroz con gandules. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could move, a series of buzzing caught her attention on Rio’s nightstand. She reached over, finding it was Rio’s family group text going off. The phone unlocked the moment she looked at it, opening up to her wife’s texts. </span>

</p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha scrolled up on the texts, knowing her wife didn’t care. She was in the group chat anyway, just rarely answered. Writing wasn’t her strong suit in Spanish. She could read just fine but she would sit there overthinking whether to use compound past tense or imperfect. But when speaking, she would just know. Her wife would always question it but of course, Agatha would just say it was because she was a hands-on learner and Rio’s tongue was an excellent teacher. </span>

<span>Agatha grimaced, standing up quickly and throwing on a pair of sweatpants and a sweatshirt before rushing into their living room. The blankets were cleaned up, boxes of ornaments sitting to the side, and the coffee table was pushed back into place with the onesie and unfinished blanket sitting neatly. She smiled fondly, looking around before moving towards the back porch. Everything was white, the pine trees far ahead holding blankets of snow to keep them warm. It was still steadily snowing, but it was light with a little sun peaking through, but her attention was on the fresh set of footprints leading to the greenhouse. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn’t surprised, especially now that Rio took the plunge and invited her siblings over for dinner, and Ximena Vidal: the matriarch of the Vidal family. Ximena raised Rio after her parents died and well, Ximena was a hard, cold woman, who still somehow radiated more warmth than Agatha had ever encountered. Agatha would never forget the woman, with eyes more intense than Rio’s, leading her away from her wife at their wedding reception. The woman merely took Agatha’s face in her hands, the way she would hold Rio (not wonder why she melted with this gesture) and smiled at her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are making my </span>
<em>
<span>Riocita</span>
</em>
<span> so happy,” she had spoken softly despite how thick her accent was. “Give her the world, </span>
<em>
<span>por favor</span>
</em>
<span>, </span>
<em>
<span>cariño</span>
</em>
<span>.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She understood Rio’s nerves about telling her family. </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita</span>
</em>
<span> will be all over her, but it was more than that, because “</span>
<em>
<span>La Pendeja</span>
</em>
<span>”? That was Maria, and Maria already had something against her youngest sister that Agatha still had yet to figure out. She knew it was some type of competition that Maria made up between them, but they were Vidal women. Vidal women were stubborn, proud, and had an easy self assured confidence that made anyone else feel inferior. So when two Vidals collided, it was as if the very threads of the universe started to unravel. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She placed her boots on and threw on a jacket before making her way out. She ignored how the cold bit at her ears and nose as she hurried through and into the greenhouse. It was warmer inside, so warm that Agatha was throwing off her coat, sweatshirt, and shoes. The greenhouse was simple, but organized in a strict fashion in which Rio had down. In the center were a row of azaleas and to the right in the corner were calla lilies and roses. To the left were lilies of the valley and red spider lilies. In the back was Rio’s more expensive plants she still had no idea what they were named, but she knew that was where her wife was. She followed the small dirt path to the back, the greens hanging over into the trail, but bright and flourishing. Her wife sat in a black wicker chair, her legs curled underneath her. her tank top was loose, the green joggers blending in with her plants. Her entire focus was on the wreath in her hands, weaving the pine and herbs into it with care, but her eyebrows were knitting themselves together and Rio was biting the inside of her cheek. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She approached slowly, but Rio didn’t look up at her, and it was then she knew what her wife needed. For the first good year of their relationship, Agatha had trouble understanding sometimes what her wife needed. She never completely understood it, even till this day, but there were times she did. Either her wife needed touch to ground her or to avoid it like the plague because it burned her. She slowly learned the signs over the years, and sure, there were moments where she either ignored them or missed them, but when she saw them, they were as clear as glass: Rio’s shoulders were tense, pulled up towards her ears, her jaw was going to work at her cheeks, and her eyebrows seemed to be debating if they should become a unibrow. She knew those signs anywhere. Her wife needed a grounding touch whether it was being held, a simple touch to her cheek, or as of lately, Rio’s hand on her stomach. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“My love,” she said softly, not wanting to startle her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t look up, but her shoulders dropped ever so slightly at the sound of Agatha’s voice. The tension in her body remained, but it had loosened just enough to tell Agatha she was listening. Agatha watched as her wife set the wreath down with more force than necessary, jaw tight as she pushed herself up from the chair. She started pacing, bare feet silent against the warm floor of the greenhouse, her fingers threading through her curls before dragging down her face. Agatha didn’t move right away. She knew better. Instead, she slid into the chair Rio had just abandoned, crossing one leg over the other as she watched her wife work herself up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re going to have something to say, I know it,” her wife muttered, mostly to herself, hands flying in exasperated gestures. “Maria’s going to be insufferable, and </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita’s</span>
</em>
<span> going to ask a million questions, and Oriana–” she huffed, shaking her head. “Oriana will be fine, but she’s not the problem. The problem is Maria.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed, neither agreeing nor disagreeing, just giving her wife space to spill. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’ll make some comment, she always does. About how I didn’t tell her sooner. About how I’m fucking doing things wrong. Like she’s the fucking expert on my life,” Rio scoffed, still pacing, hands still moving in sharp, clipped gestures. “And then she’ll say something about you. And about us. And I will </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> be fucking responsible for what I say back.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned then, eyes flashing as if daring Agatha to tell her she was overreacting. But Agatha only arched a brow, the corner of her mouth twitching with the barest hint of amusement. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s scowl deepened, “Don’t look at me like that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head, silent. Her wife exhaled sharply through her nose. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, she said nothing, just watching her with that same quiet, knowing gaze. Rio’s pacing slowed. Her hands curled into fists, then uncurled. Her shoulders, still tense, pulled up once, twice, then slumped forward in surrender. With a groan, Rio crossed the short distance between them and sank to her knees in front of Agatha. Her forehead pressed against Agatha’s thigh, her breath warm against the fabric of her sweatpants. Agatha let her settle, smoothing a hand over Rio’s dark mane, threading her fingers through the soft strands, nails scratching lightly against her scalp. She felt more than heard her wife’s exhale, a slow release of breath against her leg. Rio’s hand, without thought, slid over Agatha’s knee, then up, palm finding its familiar place on the curve of her stomach. Her fingers spread, her thumb brushing absently against the fabric of Agatha’s shirt, as if reminding herself– reminding both of them– that some things mattered more than Maria’s words. More than old wounds and past grievances. Agatha kept combing through her wife’s hair, soothing, steady. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You done?” she murmured.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffed another breath against her thigh, “Maybe.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked, shifting slightly so her wife would look up. “Maria doesn’t matter.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled sharply, “I know.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha traced the line of Rio’s jaw, guiding her up until their eyes met, “Then breathe, my love. We’re okay.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife held her gaze for a long moment before finally– finally– her shoulders sagged, the fight ebbing from her muscles like the tide retreating from the shore. Her forehead pressed back against Agatha’s leg, her fingers still resting over the life growing beneath her palm. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Cariño…</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, leaning down to press a kiss to the crown of Rio’s head, “I know, my love.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She let her wife stay there for a moment longer, fingers still stroking through locks of raven hair. Her wife nuzzled against her thigh, her hand running soothing circles on her stomach. Slowly, she leaned down, pressing another kiss to her head before giving a gentle tug, her touch coaxing rather than commanding. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come inside, my love,” she said. “You’re barefoot, and I know you’re going to start complaining soon. Plus, your kid wants their </span>
<em>
<span>mami</span>
</em>
<span>’s arroz con gandules.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife huffed but didn’t move, “Is this your cute attempt to cover up a craving, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know what you are talking about,” she decided, making her wife chuckle as she stood. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio placed a kiss on her cheek, “Okay, okay, I won’t tease you anymore since you’re carrying our child. I’ll make arroz con gandules for you and then we can decorate the tree.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife and her put their shoes back on before heading back into the house. Rio went straight to the kitchen, pulling out the ingredients as Agatha found herself back on the couch, grabbing the blanket and starting up again, losing herself in the rhythm of tying their child’s blanket together. She hardly noticed time passed until Rio held a plate out to her before sitting beside her and eating together. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio finished first, quickly grabbing Agatha seconds…and thirds…and fourths before she decided she had enough and stood to help with the tree. As they moved toward the tree, the afternoon air felt heavier with the quiet hum of their shared space. Agatha’s fingers brushed against the smooth glass of an ornament, but before she could lift it, Rio’s hand was there– always close, always sure. There was a gentle press against her stomach, a touch that had become familiar and comforting. Rio’s hand lingered for just a second longer than necessary, her fingers splayed as if she could feel the life inside Agatha even before it made its presence known to the world. Agatha glanced over at her wife, a small, playful smile tugging at her lips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t have to keep doing that,” she said softly, though there was no real protest in her voice. “The baby’s not going anywhere.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio simply smiled, brushing her thumb over Agatha’s skin, “I like knowing he’s there.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her voice was low, almost tender, as if the simple act of touching her wife grounded her to something far greater than herself. Her tensions were fully melting away as their rhythm set in between actually decorating and her wife sneaking touches to her stomach. She rolled her eyes, but the laughter was instantly spilling between them. Agatha teased Rio for being too precise with the ornaments, muttering about “the right balance,” while her wife rolled her eyes at Agatha’s habit of placing things at random, claiming it gave the tree “character.” At one point, she smirked and deliberately put a bauble in the most unbalanced, awkward spot possible, just to watch her wife twitch before sighing and fixing it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They were almost done. All that was left was the star Agatha had made for them from their very first Yule together as a couple. She had gathered a few twigs from when Rio would take her out to picnics, cleansing them and tying them together into a star before adding fresh herbs to it every year. This year her and Rio tied motherwort and coriander to it. Agatha always put the star on the stop of their tree. It was a tradition just like Rio picking the Yule tree. She found the step stool beside the boxes, bringing it over. Before she could even place her foot on the first step of the stool, hands were on her hips, pulling her back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t harsh, but it carried the weight of a thousand gentle commands. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio!” she gasped, half-laughing, half-incredulous as she found herself being bodily maneuvered away from the stool. “Are you serious?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife only gave her a firm look, the kind that brooked no argument, before taking the star from her hands as if she hadn’t just manhandled Agatha across the room, “I said no.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha folded her arms, her lips curving in an amused smirk, “You do realize I’ve been putting the star up every year, right?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not this year,” her wife shrugged, turning toward the tree with an air of finality. “This year, I put it up.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed, trying to look put out, but Rio’s overprotectiveness was so absurdly endearing she couldn’t even bring herself to be truly annoyed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re acting like I was about to scale a mountain instead of stepping on a stool,” she muttered, rolling her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, never looking away from the tree as she carefully adjusted the star.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re pregnant,” she said, as if that explained everything. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out an exaggerated sigh, “So what? Is breathing next on your list of things I’m not allowed to do?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If I thought you’d find a way to make that dangerous, yes,” her wife didn’t lose the smirk. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She stepped down, facing off with her. Agatha narrowed her eyes, real annoyance finally filling her. Blame it on hormones or blame it on her wife’s stupid smug smile. Before she could bite out something mean, lips pressed to forehead and she froze, all the irritation completely draining as if it had never existed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hate you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love you more,” her wife said simply returning the boxes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Agatha could move, to help her wife, they heard Rio’s phone ring from their room. Her wife sighed, kissing her cheek as Agatha playfully swatted at her ass, but something made her freeze, something like dread filling her system. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She shook her head the moment she heard her wife’s irritated voice, “What do </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> want?” </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Maria. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Maria’s voice came through, echoing down the hall, sharp and unimpressed, “Nice to hear from you, too, </span>
<em>
<span>hermanita</span>
</em>
<span>.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife appeared in the doorway, but she wasn’t looking at her. Her gaze was distant and her eyebrows creased together. Agatha sat down on the couch, patting the seat next to her, but her wife only began to pace in front of her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes, already regretting picking up, “Maria.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m bringing someone on Monday,” Maria said, as if she hadn’t just ignored Rio’s irritation. “My fiancé.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, “Your what?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“My fiancé,” Maria repeated, slow and deliberate, like Rio was an idiot. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife stared down at the phone in her hand as if the device itself just offended her before speaking, “You’ve had a boyfriend, and now you’re engaged? Since when?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Maria scoffed,“Like you can say anything after hiding Agatha for three years.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised a brow, but pursed her lips in an attempt to hide her amusement. It was a weak jab at Rio, a jab at closed and perfectly well healed wounds that Rio and her often found themselves laughing at when they remembered. She didn’t say anything, just watching as Rio grit her teeth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t hide her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No?” Maria’s voice dripped with mock surprise. “Oh, that’s right. I had to knock on your apartment just for her to open the door, having no idea who I was.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was twelve years ago.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And yet, it’s still embarrassing.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pinched the bridge of her nose, “Maria–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Maria cut her off with a sharp laugh, “You know, it’s funny. I never thought you’d settle down. But I guess even you had to grow up eventually.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers twitched. There was something off about Maria’s tone, something more biting than usual. She tilted her head, keeping her gaze on her wife, knowing not to intervene yet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s lips parted to respond, but Maria continued, “And now you’ve got this–” she made a noise, something dismissive “–little life you’ve built. But I have to wonder… are you really happy, </span>
<em>
<span>hermanita</span>
</em>
<span>?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stilled, her jaw clenched as her grip tightened every so slightly on the phone.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Or is it just easy?” Maria pressed, her voice lilting in faux curiosity. “Hiding away, playing pretend, shutting out the rest of us– ” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha saw the shift in her wife before she heard it– the way Rio’s grip on her phone turned vice-like, the way her shoulders pulled tight with unspoken fury. Then– </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>No estoy jugando a nada, maldita sea.</span>
</em>
<span>” (I’m not playing at anything, damn it.) </span>
</p><p>
<span>Maria hummed, like she wasn’t impressed, “</span>
<em>
<span>Por favor, Rio. No es lo mismo. No es–</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>No es qué</span>
</em>
<span>?” Rio snapped. “</span>
<em>
<span>¿No es lo que tú crees que es una familia? Porque nos casamos, María. Y es real. Más real que cualquier–</span>
</em>
<span>” (Not what? Not what you think a family is? Because we got married, Maria. And it’s real. More real than any–) </span>
</p><p>
<span>Maria scoffed, cutting her off, “</span>
<em>
<span>Sí, sí, claro. Pero dime algo–</span>
</em>
<span>” (Yeah, yeah, sure. But tell me something–) </span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, Agatha felt it. The shift. The moment before Maria struck deep, before she said something cruel enough to wound, something she couldn’t take back. Maria’s voice turned saccharine. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Dime, Rio. ¿De verdad crees que Abuelita quiere esto? Que ella de verdad quiere que dos mujeres–</span>
</em>
<span>” (Tell me, Rio. Do you really think </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita</span>
</em>
<span> wants this? That she really wants two women–) </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Enough,” Agatha’s voice cut through the conversation like a blade. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife turned, startled. Maria went silent. Agatha stood slowly, crossing the room with deliberate, measured steps. She plucked the phone from Rio’s hand with an ease that spoke of years of knowing exactly how to handle her wife’s fire. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maria,” she said, calm, cold, and utterly unyielding. “You should think very carefully before you finish that sentence.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Maria said nothing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know what you’re doing,” Agatha continued, voice as smooth as glass. “And I’ll tell you now– you won’t get what you want.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, Maria didn’t speak. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head, amusement curling at the edges of her mouth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s wrong? No clever remarks? No cheap insults?” she clicked her tongue. “Shame.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>A beat of silence before Maria exhaled, sharp and irritated, “</span>
<em>
<span>Nos vemos el lunes.</span>
</em>
<span>” (See you Monday.) </span>
</p><p>
<span>The line went dead. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lowered the phone to the coffee table before turning to her wife. She was standing still now, but her breaths were shallow, her fists clenched to the point she knew Rio’s blunt nails were about to draw blood. Tentatively, she reached for her hand, fingers easily breaking the strong grip and threading through. She guided her wife to the couch, who let out a slow, shaking breath, and rested her head against Agatha’s thigh as she laid on her side. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She stroked her hair, her fingers moving around her scalp as Rio’s gaze remained on her round stomach in front of her face. A hand came up, rubbing in circles again as Agatha sat back, watching the tension slowly leave her wife. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s not worth your anger, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s lip curled, “</span>
<em>
<span>La quiero muerta.”</span>
</em>

<b>Rio</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The basement was dimly lit between the television and the light from the heater spanning across the open space. All the lights were off as Rio slouched against the couch, blankets draped over her legs haphazardly revealing her in all of her glory : a Dean and professor, sitting back with a chunky steelseries arctis pro wireless pine green headset hugging her head and a black Playstation controller in her hands. She wore her green creeper hoodie, ignoring the way the zipper scratched her chest. Her boxers were a tighter fit, fitting her perfectly, even though they were a gag gift from Alice with Minecraft’s skulls littering them. Rio cracked her neck, her glasses slipping as she merely pushed them back up her attention locked on the screen in front of her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She moved with precision, her thumbs moving over the throttles and buttons with practiced ease as she constructed yet another layer of fortifications around her virtual castle. She spent years working on the castle outside itself and now, it was decorated on the inside with a grand throne room, ballrooms, courts, and even gardens. She called it her Queendom of Death. The obsidian walls stretch high, torches lining every crevice, ensuring no gaps, no weak spots. She had already built a watchtower, a hidden tunnel, even an emergency escape route– just in case. It was easier to focus on the game than on the conversation that still echoed in her mind. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Dime, Rio. ¿De verdad crees que Abuelita quiere esto? </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers tightened against the controller, her jaw locking. She could still hear her bitch of a sister’s voice, smooth and cutting, pressing into the scars of old wounds like she was testing how deep they went. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Que ella de verdad quiere que dos mujeres…</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span> The words had stuck, sinking into her ribs like a blade. She had barely slept, had barely eaten. Instead, she had thrown herself into the one thing she could control– her world, her defenses, her walls. Nothing could hurt her here… well, except for that memory threatening to surface. She blurred it, trying to bury it back down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was sixteen when she thought her world was about to end. She had snuck a girl home– well, the house was supposed to be empty. </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>was out with her friends, Oriana was working late, and Maria… well, all she knew at the time was that her sister wasn’t going to be home. The girl was in Rio’s class, one that she had no intention of actually dating, but who was she going to pass up on an opportunity like that. It wasn’t her first girl and for once, Rio wasn’t going to risk indecent exposure and would be lying on something comfortable instead of the sand at the beach or against a tree. Rio wasn’t sure how long they had been at it. All she knew was she was between the girl’s legs and then the door opened. There was a lot of screaming and two hours later she was on the porch before her </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>who only sighed and shook her head– but to her luck, ultimately did not care… but Maria did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She shook out of it focusing back on collecting supplies. She had a new mission : go to the caves, defeat a dragon, and collect their eggs. This time she would be successful. Her dogs, Morticia and Gomez, followed her as they made their way through the caves. It was a long way down, avoiding more monsters and fighting what she needed too. She tongued at her cheek as the screen flashed with a creeper about the blow up. She dodged it continuing her way through the grey twists and turns. Then finally, the cave opened and in the center a great black crystalled dragon turned to her. She smirked, selecting her bow and just as she aimed, the screen went black, shrouding the room in darkness. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What the fuck?!” Rio tore her headphones off but was stunned as the lights came on, blinding her instantly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The sting of light burned as Rio squeezed her eyes shut, a hiss slipping through her teeth. She barely registered the sound of footsteps before a familiar warmth pressed against her, a steady hand cupping her cheek. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Agatha murmured, voice softer than expected, but edged with something firm– unyielding. “I’ve been calling for you for the past ten minutes, my love.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio forced her eyes open, blinking rapidly to adjust. Her wife stood in front of her, framed by the dim glow of the heater, her expression unreadable. Her gaze narrowed down to her stomach, not able to help it. Her wife was in </span>
<em>
<span>Rio</span>
</em>
<span>’s </span>
<em>
<span>Bad Omens </span>
</em>
<span>t-shirt. It wasn’t oversized, in fact Rio liked this shirt more where she would tuck the end of the shirt into her bra in the summer months. Now on her wife, it didn’t hide her pregnant belly, the simple roundness that she knew an oversize shirt would struggle to hide anyway– especially at fifteen weeks pregnant. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What the hell, Agatha?” Rio’s voice came out hoarse, laced with exhaustion rather than anger. She scrubbed a hand down her face, fingers catching on the bridge of her glasses. “I was in the middle of– ”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Running,” Agatha interrupted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio froze, throat tightening as she stared up into the bright blues of her wife. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife only sighed, caressing the side of her cheek, “You always do this. You build walls, burrow yourself in caves” she tilted her head toward the now-black screen “ –whatever helps you hide. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s fingers curled into the blanket pooled around her lap, “I’m not hiding.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, her thumb pushing against her cheek softly, “Then what are you doing?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She pressed her lips together, trying to shake away Maria’s voice, the weight pressing into her chest. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Que ella de verdad quiere que dos mujeres… </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She shut her eyes, “It doesn’t matter.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clicked her tongue, tilting Rio’s chin up with two fingers, “It does. </span>
<em>
<span>You</span>
</em>
<span> matter.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled shakily, forcing herself to meet Agatha’s gaze. Her wife– her</span>
<em>
<span> brilliant, stubborn, unshakable </span>
</em>
<span>wife– looked at her with something fierce, something unwavering. Then, the expression softened as her wife turned around, plugging the television back in and before nodding her towards the love seat part of the couch. Rio found her body moving before her mind could question what was happening. She settled back, her legs now propped on the couch as her wife took her controller from her hands and turned off her headset. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you doing?” she asked, brow furrowing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife sat down between her legs, leaning back against her as she logged into the game and found her way to Rio’s world. She went back to Rio’s task of collecting food, armor, and bows and arrows before finding Morticia and Gomez in their own room </span>
</p><p>
<span>As she walked the halls of her castle, Agatha made her annoyance clear now, “Remember promising me that you would drop anything to help with any pregnancy symptoms?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tensed, her hand coming around her wife’s waist and rubbing the side of her stomach. She had read recently that her wife’s sides of her stomach might start to hurt with the stretching. She placed her lips on her wife’s head who just hummed for a moment. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not there, love. Up and under, darling,” her wife said before chuckling. “Have at it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her body was once more faster than her mind, seeking out exactly what she loved. She couldn’t stop the smile as her hands reached unearth her wife’s shirt, moving up soft skin to two plush breasts. Rio’s hands moved instinctively, palms warm against Agatha’s skin, thumbs tracing slow, reverent circles over the soft swell of her breasts. The moment Agatha melted into her, a low hum slipping past her lips, Rio exhaled, her forehead pressing against the back of her wife’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know,” her wife mused as she maneuvered herself into the pixelated cave, “for someone who spends their time building defenses, you’re incredibly weak in one specific area.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She blinked, “What the hell are you talking about?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked, clicking her tongue as she gathered supplies in-game, “Oh, I think </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> know. I’m starting to think you love them more than me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s grip faltered for half a second before she growled, nipping at Agatha’s shoulder in retaliation, “</span>
<em>
<span>No empieces, mi amor.</span>
</em>
<span>” (Don’t start, my love). </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, clicking her tongue as she raced away from an exploding creeper on screen, “I mean, I get it, really. They </span>
<em>
<span>are </span>
</em>
<span>spectacular. Perky, full–” she gave a little dramatic sigh, “ –and they are just going to get bigger.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groaned, dropping her forehead against Agatha’s back, her fingers twitching where they cupped soft, warm skin, “Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife ignored her suffering, tilting her head thoughtfully, “You know, I’ve caught you staring. </span>
<em>
<span>A lot.</span>
</em>
<span> Like, an inappropriate amount for a boss to look at their </span>
<em>
<span>married</span>
</em>
<span> employee.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She gritted her teeth, “I will end you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked, finally turning to glance at her over her shoulder, eyes glinting with mischief, “You’d have to let go first.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio only returned the smirk, her hands slipping out of her wife’s shirt causing her wife to hiss in pain. She froze, her eyes losing their teasing gleam as her hands went back immediately, massaging the warm skin there as her wife pushed her chest more firmly into her hands. Regret crept in hard, not realizing how sore they must be. Her wife paused the game allowing Rio to massage her breasts and place apologetic kisses to her head repeatedly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why didn’t you come to me sooner, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>?” she asked softly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife shrugged, “You needed space to think, my love–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You gave me it all yesterday after the call, plus </span>
<em>
<span>this–” </span>
</em>
<span>a hand rested briefly on her stomach before moving back up “ –is more important than anything. How long have they been bothering you?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Since this morning,” she shrugged again, forcing nonchalance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio sighed, but her wife just continued the game, heading deeper into the caves. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They sat there in silence minus the chopping of blocks, the fling of arrows, and hiss of creepers. Rio kept her hands on her wife’s breasts as Agatha defeated a Minecraft dragon and was claiming her prize of an egg. She had rolled her eyes, knowing how good her wife was at this game. Rio had taught her years ago, after months of begging for her to play it with her. Agatha would act like she hated the game, alway muttering “you’re lucky I love you,” before sitting her ass down and playing like a professional. She had even helped Rio build part of the castle and one day Rio came back from a meeting with her advisor, she caught her playing without her. Her girlfriend at the time tried distracting her with sex, but she was wearing Rio’s creeper boxers– the ones she claimed that she would burn– and well, of course Rio hasn’t let her live it down since. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As her wife went back down into the caves to find another dragon, Rio kissed the side of her head, “You think he will like Minecraft?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who?” her wife asked absentmindedly, her gaze remaining on killing a zombie. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio cupped her wife’s stomach, “Our son, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor.</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p><span>“Yeah, I am sure he</span> <span>will like it. Kids usually take interest in what their parents are interested in.”</span></p><p>
<span>She couldn’t stop the smirk as everything lit up with excitement. She was silent for a moment, wondering if her wife would catch what she just said, but instead she ran into another zombie and killed it with ease, watching it poof into smoke. Rio leaned forward, pressing a kiss to her neck as she chuckled darkly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She watched as her wife’s fingers froze for just a heartbeat, her character pausing in the game for a split second as the realization dawned on her. Rio had been wondering when her wife would slip, to subconsciously agree they were going to have a son. Her wife had always been careful, always referring to their child as “they” but Rio couldn’t stop the way her heart was flipping as it finally came out. </span>
<em>
<span>He</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her lip curled into a knowing smile, a triumphant glint flashing in her eyes. Her wife ignored her, continuing the game, and for once Rio thought to have pity on her but the moment was just too sweet to ignore. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Placing another kiss below her ear, she started casually, “So, when our son is born…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hand moved to her wife’s stomach, the warmth of her touch gentle but possessive. She knew exactly what she was doing. Agatha’s eyes flicked down for a moment, her thumbs moving on the controller, as if trying to ignore the slip. Her shoulders were tense as her posture shifted, feigning to make herself more comfortable, but Rio could tell— this was just enough proof her wife was starting to believe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You just called </span>
<em>
<span>him </span>
</em>
<span>‘he,’” she teased, her voice humming a laugh, her hand moving in slow, soothing circles on Agatha’s belly. “You’re slipping, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>. You’re starting to realize that I’m right.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed dramatically, a theatrical show of annoyance but a small smile betrayed her performance, “Maybe I just </span>
<em>
<span>want </span>
</em>
<span>to mess with you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s a beat silence as Agatha slashed another zombie, “Maybe I’m tired of you being so fucking smug about it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pressed her lips to the side of neck again as her hands went back to massaging her wife’s breasts, her thumb pressing down gently as she felt her heartbeat pounding underneath her palm. It made Rio’s own heart skip a beat as she nuzzled her nose there, taking in her sweet scent. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Or maybe,” she whispered. “You’re just mad because you know I am right. Can’t you see it? May fourteenth he will come screaming into the world with a head of black hair, dark brown eyes, the same nose as mine, and I guess he can have your chin, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>That earned her a sharp elbow in her stomach, “Do you want me to get you more dragon eggs or not?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought you hated Minecraft,” Rio bit back, chopping her teeth noisily by her ear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nudged her again, her eyes gleaming, “I’ll blow up your castle.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gasped, her eyes widening comically,  “You wouldn’t.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife smirked, turning her character around and pulling out TNT. Panic set into her chest as she sat up, releasing her wife’s breasts slowly before hand shot out to grab the controller off of her. Her wife had a firm grip on it as she tugged and pulled, trying to twist it away but her wife just laughed evilly, leading the character out of the cave as Rio sat up, her hands pulling at her wife’s arms. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, wait– no!</span>
<em>
<span> Devuélvelo, por favor– </span>
</em>
<span>ah! </span>
<em>
<span>Bruja, no te atrevas!</span>
</em>
<span>” she laughed as she leaned over her wife, both of them falling into fits of laughter as they fought over the controller. (Give it back, please– Witch, don’t you dare). </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her sides hurt as she managed to yank the controller out of her grip, standing up on the couch now as their laughter filled over the sounds of the game. She led her character away when suddenly a hand wrapped around her ankle, and the world tilted. She yelped as she crashed back into the couch before her body rolled onto the floor. Then, from the television a loud explosion went off and the screen went red. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had barely time to notice it as her attention turned back to her wife who was clutching her stomach as she laughed, little snorts rolling her shoulders as she tried covering it, tears coming from her eyes. She felt a soft smile on her face as her wife covered her mouth, continuing to laugh, her snorts making Rio’s heart flutter. Her wife hated her laugh, but it was one of the many reasons Rio fell in love with her. She would never forget the first time she made Agatha truly laugh, how red her cheeks were as she hid from Rio, suddenly all shy. Rio had only smiled brightly, pulling her hands away as Agatha had calmed down her laughter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“That was the cutest laugh I ever heard,” Rio smiled down at her, tucking chestnut strands behind her ear. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha shook her head, her cheeks pink as her eyes closed, “No, it’s not–” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio cut her off with a sweet kiss, smiling into it as her girlfriend melted. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And since then, it was Rio’s goal for the rest of her life to make that sound happen over and over again. She sat up from where she landed on the ground, laughing lightly as her wife reached out, caressing her head worriedly. Blue and brown locked with each other as Rio’s hands found her way to her wife’s stomach, caressing it softly as they fell into a comfortable silence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you alright, my love?” her wife asked her sweetly, a hand still resting on the back of her head where she noticed a light throbbing setting in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She nodded anyway, “Yes, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>. And our son?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife shook her head, but smiled nevertheless, “Our </span>
<em>
<span>child </span>
</em>
<span>is fine. Now, come on. I let you mope all yesterday. I need your help cleaning for tomorrow.” </span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio paced back and forth in front of the oven as her wife sat behind her at the counter, drinking her tea as eyes followed her. She just placed the lamb in the oven after following the directions from her wife all day. Agatha’s ankles and wrists had started to swell yesterday and Rio wasn’t going to let her do any more work. The last hour of the night was spent with her on the floor before the couch with lotion rubbing her ankles for her. Her wife didn’t even have to ask her. Rio knew immediately what she needed as Agatha worked on the baby’s blanket. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, it was Monday. </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>and her sisters would be here any moment. She wasn’t sure what she was more nervous of– </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>or Maria. </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>would be so happy for them finally starting a family, but everything in her was tight every time she thought of how they would tell her. Agatha’s plan was simple: finish dinner, eat dinner, play some games that she knew </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>loved, and then give them all an envelope with the twelve week scan photos. It was practical, a careful delivery, but something in Rio told her that it wouldn’t be so simple. Something would happen, and that something she did not know made her want to cancel the whole thing last minute. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“My love,” her wife’s calm voice reached her. “You’re going to wear a hole in my floors.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised an eyebrow, “</span>
<em>
<span>My </span>
</em>
<span>floors, </span>
<em>
<span>cariño. </span>
</em>
<span>I was the one who put them down.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife rolled her eyes, “Point still stands, sweetheart. You are not adding more work on top of us building the nursery. Now, did you hide my blanket for me? The stroller is hidden in the garage?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She nodded, “Yes and yes. I put the onesie away too.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And the strap?” Agatha smirked. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“¡Mierda!</span>
</em>
<span>” Rio swore, running back to their bathroom knowing her family had a tendency to snoop. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio would never forget Oriana’s mortification when she visited them in their shitty apartment during their doctorate schooling. Rio had forgotten to put their strap away from the previous night, leaving it on the counter of the sink in their only bathroom. Oriana had walked in and both of them had heard her gasp before she yelled at Rio… meanwhile, the strap wasn’t even green… it was purple. The one now, standing up tall on their bathroom counter was green. </span>
</p><p>
<span>All of the articles were right– Agatha’s libido was high, but Rio would never complain– it brought her back to when they first started having sex. It was an addiction– still is but more tame. They defiled plenty of supply closets, two private study rooms, and too many times Lilia had knocked on Agatha’s bedroom door telling them to “shut the fuck up.” Now, Rio was sure as hell Agatha would have them fuck in one of their offices if they were not on break. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was half tempted to leave it out, knowing Maria would snoop and let her be traumatized, but one thought of her </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>seeing it had Rio putting it away in their dresser drawer full of their other sex toys. It wasn’t their finest hiding spot, rather the most accessible, but it wasn’t like her sisters or </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>would go through her drawers… right? </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio padded back out to the kitchen, finding her wife still sitting at the kitchen island. A smile crept across her face as she took in her wife. Agatha let her braid her hair back in a half-up, half-down style. Two braids sat on either side of her head, coming together in the back where Rio had combined them and braided down to her waist. Her wife did the same for her and Rio had beamed when she finally convinced her wife to match hairstyles with her. A large oversized purple sweater wrapped around her, the bump only noticeable if Agatha was doing what she was doing now: a hand rubbing the side of her stomach, easing the discomfort she felt as black leggings wrapped around her legs comfortably. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wrapping her arms around her and kissing her head, she spoke softly, “If you do that in front of </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>she will know that you’re pregnant before the announcement.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife laughed, hands resting over top of hers, “And if you keep doting over me, you’re going to be the one to give it away. </span>
<em>
<span>I </span>
</em>
<span>am not the problem here.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio feigned her hurt expression, “Excuse me, I didn’t realize doting was now not allowed.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, “It is when you are touching my stomach twenty-four seven– ugh, how bad are you going to be once they start kicking?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll become your worst nightmare,” she cooed, pressing her lips repeatedly to her head and cheeks. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife turned, capturing her lips. Rio smiled into it, feeling a hand come up and cup her cheek as the kiss lasted it. Their lips moved evenly and sure, capturing each other over and over again in a shared rhythm, speaking a simple devotion to each other as if this was their first time. Something warm and wet prodded at her lips, and on instinct, she parted them, tasting her wife before pulling away abruptly, causing her wife to scowl at her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t start something you can’t finish, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>,” she murmured against her lips before pecking her softly. Later, </span>
<em>
<span>cariño.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife only nodded, their lips meeting again before a loud insistent knock echoed from the hallway. Rio froze, her heart pounding faster than the knocks. She stared down the hallway, not able to will her feet to move just yet until lips pressed against her cheek. She startled for a moment, meeting bright understanding blues. Her wife smiled at her, squeezing her shoulder as the simple touch brought her back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’ll be alright, my love. Go, don’t keep </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>waiting</span>
<em>
<span>.</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>

<b>Rio</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated for a moment longer before breathing out a long breath. She approached the door cautiously, smoothing out her own green sweater before opening it to the cold. The cold hit her face first, the snow blowing onto her front porch, but then warmth cradled her. She gasped as a frail but strong body was wrapping around her, a face burrowing into the crook of her shoulder. She smiled, all of the nerves and doubts ceasing to exist as her shoulders sagged. She took a deep breath in, meeting the rich ancient aroma of sandalwood mingling with the warmth of vetiver. She nuzzled in closer, finding the sweetness of orange blossoms, reminding her of her childhood in the hot summer sun of Puerto Rico. Then, the scent pulled away just slightly and warm, gentle, brittle hands were cupping her face as she pulled back to stare into brown eyes so dark they were almost black. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Dioses míos, Riocita, mírate. Mi nieta hermosa. ¿Estás comiendo lo suficiente? Te ves delgada, nieta,</span>
</em>
<span>” her </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>fussed over her. (My gods, little Rio, look at you. My beautiful granddaughter. Are you eating enough? You’re looking thin, granddaughter.) </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Sí, Abuelita, estoy muy bien. ¿Cómo estuvo el vuelo?</span>
</em>
<span>” she beamed down at her grandmother finding the woman looked as if she had barely aged. (Yes, Abuelita, I am just fine. How was the flight?)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hair was long and silver, almost as long as her wife’s. Her face was full of wrinkles and her neck hidden from a green wool scarf wrapped tightly around her. Rio was quick to take her coat, guiding her </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>further inside the home to get her warm. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita</span>
</em>
<span> huffed, looking around, “</span>
<em>
<span>Los vuelos son cada vez más largos, Riocita</span>
</em>
<span>.” (The flights are getting longer and longer, little Rio.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>She gasped as she was pulled into another hug, the old woman almost breaking her spin as she nuzzled back into her </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita</span>
</em>
<span>’s warmth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Dioses, te extrañé, querida niña.</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio!” a cheery voice made her eyes flick up to Oriana walking in with tray in her hands. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They smiled at each other softly as her older sister held up a perfect </span>
<em>
<span>tembleque</span>
</em>
<span>. She was smaller than Rio, but with the same dark curls but way shorter. It was a sweet pixie cut, longer than the last time she saw her sister. Her eyes were the same as hers, but somehow softer. Oriana was the perfect picture of the softness of the Vidal genes. Her face was more round, her cheek bones softer and her jawline dull. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oriana,” she smiled softly over </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita</span>
</em>
<span>’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then her sister stepped to the side, allowing two figures to emerge through the door. They both were taller, more imposing especially the first figure. Maria, she was the picture of the sharp commanding features of a Vidal. Her hair was longer than Rio’s, she was taller, thinner but not as fit as Rio. Her cheekbones were sharp, her eyes almost cat-like and the same darkness of </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita</span>
</em>
<span>’s. Their eyes met and instantly, something darkened in Rio as </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita</span>
</em>
<span> pulled away, turning towards the three sisters as the door behind Maria closed. Rio’s gaze shifted to the man behind her eldest sister. He was buff, his hair combed neatly to the side as he wore khakis and a nice blue button up, but to her surprise his hazel eyes were kind, if not shy. He stood behind her sister unsure as they began slipping out their shoes and hanging up their coats on the rack beside him. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Abuelita</span>
</em>
<span> beamed, stepping between the two sisters as she nodded to the man, “</span>
<em>
<span>Río, querido, este es Jack, el prometido de tu hermana.</span>
</em>
<span>” (Rio, my dear, this Jack, your sister’s fiance</span>
<em>
<span>)</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Her </span>
<em>
<span>abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>paused, staring at Maria who only smirked at Rio darkly, “Jack, baby, this is my little sister, Rio.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The man stepped forward shyly, offering his hand. His grip was light, hesitant as they shook hands. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Él no habla español, es una pena realmente,</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita</span>
</em>
<span> scowled. (He doesn’t speak Spanish– it’s a shame really.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio almost choked on her own breath. For a moment, she thought she misheard. That maybe exhaustion had finally caught up with her, that her mind had twisted </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita’s</span>
</em>
<span> words into something they weren’t. But no– there was no mistake. Ximena Vidal, the immovable matriarch, the force that had carved their family’s legacy into stone, had just dismissed Maria. The golden child. The perfect granddaughter. The heiress. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Maria’s face didn’t fall, not completely– she was too proud for that– but Rio caught the sharp flicker of tension in her jaw, the way her smirk tightened like a pulled thread about to snap. She hadn’t expected that. Neither had Rio. Her sister had spent her whole life at </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita’s</span>
</em>
<span> side, soaking in the praise, basking in the approval that had never been Rio’s to claim. While Rio had been the river, wild and untamed, Maria had been the shining sun, the favored one, the one who could do no wrong. Until now. And all it had taken was a fiancé who couldn’t speak Spanish. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio flicked her gaze to Jack, who still stood there, awkward and unaware, shifting slightly as if he could sense the battle lines being drawn but had no idea what war had just begun. Poor guy. He had no clue what it meant to be a Vidal. No clue that his inability to speak their language was a crack in Maria’s perfect façade, a fracture in the golden image she had crafted so meticulously. And Rio? Rio was relishing every second of it. She had to bite down on the inside of her cheek to keep from laughing, pressing her lips into a thin, neutral line. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Don’t smirk. Don’t smirk. Don’t–</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>But Maria’s dark eyes snapped to her, sharp as knives, and Rio knew that Maria knew. She knew Rio had caught it, had witnessed that fleeting moment of imperfection. Of failure. Maria straightened, rolling her shoulders back, her grip tightening on Jack’s arm as if to remind herself that he was still a prize, even if he was less than ideal in </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita’s</span>
</em>
<span> eyes. She recovered fast– she always did. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I suppose not everyone can be perfect,” Maria hummed, her voice smooth as silk but sharpened like a dagger. She tilted her head just so, her smirk returning, trying to regain her footing. “</span>
<em>
<span>Pero no te preocupes, Abuelita. Yo le enseñaré.</span>
</em>
<span>” (But not to worry, Abuelita. I’ll teach him.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio almost barked out a laugh, </span>
<em>
<span>Oh, she’s scrambling. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Abuelita</span>
</em>
<span> barely acknowledged her words, cupping Rio’s cheek with one hand as they listened to the timer of the oven from the kitchen, </span>
<em>
<span>“¿Supongo que tu esposa está en la cocina?” </span>
</em>
<span>(I assume your wife is in the kitchen?) </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Sí, déjame ir a cenar,</span>
</em>
<span>” Rio said, already rushing around her </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>and into the kitchen. (Yes, let me go grab our dinner though.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife was about to stand from her place, but Rio’s sharp eyes narrowed to her, daring her to move as she reached for the oven mitts and pulled out the lamb. Just as she set the tray on the glass top stove, her sisters and </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>came into the kitchen. Oriana was first, setting her dessert down and wrapping Agatha into a warm hug. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, Agatha, it’s been too long. How are you?” her sister greeted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife gave her soft smile, “I’m wonderful, Oriana. The </span>
<em>
<span>tembleque </span>
</em>
<span>looks amazing.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was half listening to their conversation, but something made her turn as her </span>
<em>
<span>abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>stepped into the kitchen, dark eyes trained on her wife. She watched as they flicked up and down her form, studying her face and then to her wife’s stomach. </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita</span>
</em>
<span>’s eyebrow raised as Oriana stepped away, leaving a clear view for </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita</span>
</em>
<span> to study her wife. Then, those sharp eyes softened her mouth hanging open in shock, stepping towards her wife with speed that surprised Rio for an old lady. Rio found herself moving too, realizing that nothing passed Ximena. Her wife turned to her with a soft smile, and fuck, Agatha really was glowing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Abuela, que bueno verte</span>
</em>
<span>,” her wife smiled at her, but Ximena wasn’t listening to her. (It’s so good to see you.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Everyone in the kitchen froze as Ximena stopped before Agatha, her hands raised over her stomach. Everything in Rio tightened. Her wife never had someone else other than Rio touch her belly and now, her </span>
<em>
<span>abuelita, </span>
</em>
<span>who did whatever she pleased, was reaching for her stomach. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t stop herself as her mouth opened, trying to stop the reigning matriarch, “</span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita, esperar–” (</span>
</em>
<span>Abuelita, wait–) </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Cállate, niña,</span>
</em>
<span>” her </span>
<em>
<span>abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>snapped, stopping her in her tracks. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, her </span>
<em>
<span>abuelita’s </span>
</em>
<span>hands landed on their target, smoothing over her wife’s sweater so slowly, so carefully as if she were caressing something made of glass. The room held its breath as her wife relaxed under </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita’s </span>
</em>
<span>touch, a hand resting over </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita’s </span>
</em>
<span>wrinkled one, smiling down at the older woman. Rio stood frozen beside them, her breath caught waiting for something, some type of small praise, or even getting hit for not telling her, but none of it came. Instead, she watched as the unshakeable force, the untouchable– the woman who raised her who didn’t take any type of bullshit– cried. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tears poured from </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita’s </span>
</em>
<span>eyes as her voice grew softer than anything Rio had heard in her entire thirty-three years of existence, “</span>
<em>
<span>Mi niña… estás trayendo vida a nuestra familia.</span>
</em>
<span>” (My girl… you are bringing life to our family.) </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her </span>
<em>
<span>abuelita’s</span>
</em>
<span> voice, normally a commanding force that could silence an entire room, now trembled with emotion that was raw, unfiltered, and real. It was not the voice of the indomitable matriarch but of a grandmother, a woman who had carried generations of weight upon her back and was now witnessing something she had longed for. Agatha’s soft smile deepened, her fingers brushing over the back of </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita’s</span>
</em>
<span> hand in reassurance, in quiet understanding. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They both expected scrutiny, questions, maybe even skepticism, anything but </span>
<em>
<span>this. </span>
</em>
<span>Never tears, never the way </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>was staring at her wife like she was life itself. Rio felt something deep inside her chest tighten in a different way, and then it cracked open. Her </span>
<em>
<span>abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>never cried. Not when Rio had come home without her parents that night. Not when they attended their funeral. Not even when </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelo </span>
</em>
<span>passed, though through it all, Rio knew </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>had wept in the dark, in private, away from prying eyes. She went where no one could witness the grief of a woman who always held herself tall and proud, never breaking. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Yet… here she was… breaking for </span>
<em>
<span>Rio’s </span>
</em>
<span>wife…breaking for Agatha…for the life they created… for the great-grandchild she had likely been waiting for the moment they had been married. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Abuelita’s</span>
</em>
<span> hands trembled as she pressed her palm a little firmer against the swell of Agatha’s belly, as if committing the shape of it to memory. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Dios mío,”</span>
</em>
<span> she whispered, her voice hoarse.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, she sniffed, gathering herself, swiping the wetness from her eyes as if embarrassed by her own reaction. She turned her gaze up to Agatha, and there it was: the warmth, the approval, the fierce love that so few ever earned from her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Eres una bendición para esta familia, Agatha,</span>
</em>
<span>” she declared, voice still thick with emotion but stronger now. (You are a blessing to this family, Agatha.) </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt the air leave her lungs, because Rio had never heard those words spoken– not to herself, not Oriana, and not even to Maria. Her wife was swept into a tight hug before </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>took her face into her hands, peppering kisses to her forehead like she did when Rio and her sisters were young. Then, </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>pulled away, turning to Rio and for a split second, she felt small. Not in the way Maria always made her feel, not in the way professors had made her feel when she was young and too smart-mouthed for her own good. No, this was different. This was ancestral. This was a granddaughter standing before the head of the family, a powerful force, awaiting judgement from the matriarch. Her </span>
<em>
<span>abuelita’s </span>
</em>
<span>eyes were still wet as arms reached for her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio froze, her eyes widening as </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>caressed her cheeks again. It wasn’t like </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>never did this– but she only did this in greeting after not seeing each other for a while or when she was proud. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Ven aquí, niña,</span>
</em>
<span>” she said softly, and Rio moved before she could think. (Come here, child.) </span>
</p><p>
<span>She stepped closer, hands stiff at her sides as if she didn’t know what to do with herself, until </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita</span>
</em>
<span> reached out and grabbed her wrist, pulling her into her arms. Her mouth fell open as the hug shrouded her in warmth, and once more Rio could hardly understand what was happening. Her hugs were always warm, always a safe space, but this felt different. This was more than her warmth, more than her safety, more than her love, and slowly Rio started to realize this was her pride– something Maria and her constantly fought for. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, just to make the realization hit harder, she whispered, voice thick with emotion, “</span>
<em>
<span>Hiciste bien, mi Riocita.</span>
</em>
<span>” (You did well, my little Rio.) </span>
</p><p>
<span>And just like that, it broke Rio out of her stupor as she audibly gasped, her eyes burning as they glanced towards her wife. Agatha was smiling softly as her, her hand rubbing the side of her stomach. Their eyes met and for a moment Rio read from her wife, </span>
<em>
<span>I told you she would be proud. </span>
</em>
<span>Rio wanted to roll her eyes, to make a snarky comment at her, but all she could do was fist the back of </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita</span>
</em>
<span>’s blouse as she exhaled, shakingly slow and shuddering. </span>
</p><p><span>The side of her neck grew wet with her </span><em><span>abuelita’s </span></em><span>tears</span> <span>and she just held her back, holding </span><em><span>Abuelita </span></em><span>together as she shook and cried into her. She watched as Oriana smiled at her, her own eyes glossing over as she stepped back, pushing Maria and Jack out with her. She didn’t miss the way her eldest sister’s mouth hung open in complete shock, and she revelled in it. </span></p><p>
<span>When </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>finally pulled away, her wife was beside her, holding the envelope that contained the picture of the scan. With shaking hands, </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>opened, staring at the photos with wide eyes. Agatha leaned into Rio, her lips pressing against her cheek softly making Rio beam. Her own hand came down to her wife’s stomach, a steady reassurance for both of them that this was </span>
<em>
<span>really </span>
</em>
<span>happening. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>¿Hasta– hasta dónde, querida?” Abuelita’s </span>
</em>
<span>voice was hesitant for once. (How- how far, my dear?)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, softly, “</span>
<em>
<span>Ahora tengo quince semanas, pero esas son las ecografías de la semana doce. Sabremos el sexo el día veintiocho.</span>
</em>
<span>” (I’m fifteen weeks now, but those are the twelve week scans. We find out the gender on the twenty-eighth.)</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Abuelita</span>
</em>
<span> blinked up at them for a moment before looking over Agatha once, twice, thrice, and, “</span>
<em>
<span>Vas a tener un niño, mi niña.</span>
</em>
<span>” (You are having a boy, my girl.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio barked out a laugh, not able to help it as her wife gawked at </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita. </span>
</em>
<span>Everything in her became giddy, her heart swelling as she shook her head, knowing her </span>
<em>
<span>abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>was right. Ximena was hardly wrong on things, and her knowing right away that her wife was pregnant, even with the sweater completely hiding the swell of her stomach, just proved Rio’s point further. Agatha scowled at her before poking her hard in the side just under her ribs. She yelped before pulling her closer and kissing her wife’s head despite her protests. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Déjame adivinar, ustedes dos tienen una apuesta y por una vez, Río tiene razón,” Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>smirked. (Let me guess, you two have a bet and for once, Rio is right.) </span>
</p><p>
<span>They both nodded, making </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>smirk but before anything else could be said, Oriana peaked in again, her face shy but brimming in excitement as she stepped back into the kitchen. She knew her sister wouldn’t be able to hold back any longer and was actually surprised Oriana even stepped out of the room in the first place. </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>gave her a small nod to come and her older sister practically dived into Rio. Rio gasped, staggering back as she tried wrestling her sister off of her, but it was futile despite being stronger. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Por los dioses, por los dioses, Riocita, ¡vas a ser mamá! ¡Estás a punto de ser mamá! ¡YO VOY A SER TÍA!” </span>
</em>
<span>she screeched into Rio’s eardrum, making her brain rattle as her skin crawled with the unwanted touch. (By the gods, by the gods, little Rio, you’re going to be a mom! You’re about to be a mom! I’M GOING TO BE AN AUNT!)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled out of her grip, hiding behind her wife who was next to get assaulted by Oriana’s affections. Her wife merely laughed, hugging her sister back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, Agatha, this is so wonderful,” Oriana beamed, pulling away and reaching down but stopped herself, looking up for permission. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife nodded, allowing their child’s </span>
<em>
<span>Tia</span>
</em>
<span> to feel the roundness of her stomach where they grew. Rio smiled, watching her family. Her </span>
<em>
<span>abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>was still gushing over the scan while Oriana couldn’t stop crying. Her wife was still glowing and their eyes met with a silent understanding at how happy they made their family… but it didn’t last… they knew it wouldn’t. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The room seemed to drop temperatures as a shadow loomed over Rio. She turned slowly, meeting the forced smile of her eldest sister. She could see the muscles in her sister’s cheeks working, holding it all together as Maria slowly cracked underneath it all. Her eyes were dark, calculating, flicking between them as she seemed to hold her breath, not wanting to drink in the poisonous gases that threatened her pride. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio straightened herself, keeping her hand protectively over her wife’s stomach as her wife further leaned into her on instinct. Maria’s eyes dropped to her hand, watching as Agatha placed her own hand over Rio’s where the emerald ring sparkled, mocking Maria. Then something unreadable flashed through eyes as she tilted her head, her tongue pushing at her cheek before stepping closer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” she started, her voice too strained, too practiced. “This is quite a surprise, </span>
<em>
<span>Riocita.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio almost scoffed– almost but was stopped by something squeezing her hand. She didn’t need to look at her wife to know she was telling her to behave. </span>
</p><p>
<span>However, the middle sister was completely oblivious to the building tension or didn’t care. She was bouncing, vibrating with excitement as she stared at the image with </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita.</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is just amazing, right, Maria? Oh, Rio’s gonna be a mom!” she practically squealed, making everyone in the room wince. “Oh, </span>
<em>
<span>Riocita, </span>
</em>
<span>I will be the best, most incredible–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“ –excessively loud–” Rio muttered, earning a pinch from her wife.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tia ever!” Oriana finished, completely unphased. “I mean really, who knew this day would come, but of course only Agatha could tame and put up with this one–” she gestured to Rio who shot her glare “ –and now a new generation of Vidals.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>¿Una nueva generación de Vidals?</span>
</em>
<span>” Maria let out a dark chuckle</span>
<em>
<span> “¿Es este feto siquiera de sangre Vidal?” </span>
</em>
<span>(A new generation of Vidals? Is this fetus even Vidal blood?)</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was meant to be a blow on Rio, the fact that Rio was not carrying– something that might disappoint </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita</span>
</em>
<span>. But the word ‘</span>
<em>
<span>feto’ </span>
</em>
<span>delivered the true blow for Rio. In truth, sure, it was a fetus– an unborn child, but the way her sister said it– the dismissive, easy nonchalance made Rio’s blood boil. She gritted her teeth, her mouth about to open as </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>snapped her head up, intrigued now, but Agatha’s grip on her hand tightened, silencing Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Nuestro hijo sólo tiene sangre Harkness-Vidal. No hubo esperma de donante. Usamos la médula ósea de Río,</span>
</em>
<span>” her wife spoke calmly, but her eyes were ablaze on Maria. (Our child has only Harkness-Vidal blood. There was no donor sperm. We used Rio’s bone marrow.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio could feel the anger radiating off her wife, but it all dissipated as </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>beamed at them. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Un niño hecho desde cero,” Abuelita’s </span>
</em>
<span>voice was in awe. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“‘</span>
<em>
<span>Cero’?” </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha looked up at Rio, her eyebrows creasing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Scratch– she means a child made from scratch,” Rio murmured softly before nodding at </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Abuelita</span>
</em>
<span> pressed her hands over her heart as she looked between them, between Rio’s wife’s stomach and her proud, stubborn stance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Ay, mija,</span>
</em>
<span>” she whispered, stepping forward to take Agatha’s hands into her own. “</span>
<em>
<span>Eres una maravilla. Una bendición. ¿Cómo te sientes? ¿Te ha estado cuidando bien mi nieta o sigue siendo una terca insoportable</span>
</em>
<span>?” (You are a marvel. A blessing. How do you feel? Has my granddaughter been taking good care of you, or is she still an insufferable stubborn thing?) </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, warm and knowing. “</span>
<em>
<span>Ella ha estado–</span>
</em>
<span>” (She’s been–</span>
<em>
<span>)</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“–cuido mucho a mi esposa, muchas gracias–” ( –I take great care of my wife, thank you very much– )</span>
</p><p>
<span>“ </span>
<em>
<span>–sobreprotector,</span>
</em>
<span>” Agatha finished smoothly, earning a sharp look from Rio. (–overprotective.)</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Abuelita</span>
</em>
<span> huffed before ushering Agatha toward the dining table, completely dismissing Rio in favor of her now favorite grandchild-in-law. She could only shake her head as her sister came beside her, helping her take the food into the dining room. Rio carried in the lamb as her sister carried in the potatoes and gravy. </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>was already sitting at the head of the dinner table, Maria on her right and Agatha on her left. Jack sat next to Maria, fidgeting as his gaze shifted between her wife and </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita, </span>
</em>
<span>looking completely lost. She could laugh at how stupid he looked among the Vidals– well, mainly how stupid Maria looked bringing a man around who didn’t speak Spanish. </span>
</p><p>
<span>In truth, Agatha didn’t speak Spanish when they met, but after three years of dating, she was pretty fluent as Rio would barely give her a break some days, forcing her to drown or swim. So, when Agatha met </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>after those three years, </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>was immediately taken with her. She still counted it as a win, especially as her wife and </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>were talking away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Oriana came back with the last of their sides as the family all sat down, Rio next to her wife, forcing Oriana to face their grandmother at the head of the table. Across from her, she caught Jack staring at the wall full of pictures and more accurately, Rio’s favorite from the wedding. She braced herself for it as his gaze met hers, but shocked by how quiet and sincere his words were. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The wedding must have been beautiful, Rio,” he said, just loud enough for Rio to hear. “Was it here in Westview?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shared a polite smile, “No, we got married in Salem. And you, any plans for your wedding?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Maria raised an eyebrow as Jack went quiet, “Oh, so suddenly interested, </span>
<em>
<span>hermanita</span>
</em>
<span>.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s lip curled, “Not really, although I am curious who could be attracted to your stellar personality.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>They went quiet, both of them staring each other down as Oriana started a conversation with Jack, easing him out of the warzone while Agatha and </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>remained oblivious. </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>was stacking her wife’s plate with food, asking her questions so fast, she was surprised her wife could understand. But Rio was hardly paying attention. She was locked in battle against her eldest sister as they both leaned suddenly forward, waiting to see who would break. Neither did, and the jabs continued. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know, I just never thought I’d see the day,” Maria mused, taking a slow sip of wine. “You, a mother? With how reckless you used to be?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t even flinch, “And yet, here we are.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Maria’s lips twitched, “Agatha must have the patience of a saint, especially while pregnant.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, “Or she just really likes me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Maria scoffed, looking at Agatha as if searching for some hidden flaw she had yet to find. Her wife must have finally gone to check on Rio and noticed the tension between them. A hand landed on her thigh, stopping her bouncing knee as she rubbed her leg. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife raised an eyebrow, but clearly tried to add humor to cool down the tension, “She grows on you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Maria laughed, but it wasn’t out of humor as her head cocked to the side, her eyes flicking back to Rio, “Like cordyceps I’m sure.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The table stilled, everyone’s forks pausing mid-air as </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>sat up straighter eyeing her granddaughters. Rio didn’t miss the way </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>eyed them, but she ultimately said nothing as Rio’s jaw clenched tighter, her grip on her own fork starting to bend the metal. Her wife kept her hand on her thigh, rubbing it up and down to sooth her, but Rio hardly noticed it as from the other side of her, Oriana groaned. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Here we go,” she muttered, setting her fork down and taking a long drink of wine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned forward more, her gaze refusing to leave Maria’s, “Careful, Maria” she mocked her “your green is showing.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her sister’s smile was sharp and unforgiving, as she scoffed, “Jealous? You are saying that I am jealous? Of what?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned back, a smirk spreading across her lips as her wife squeezed her thigh hard in warning, but she ignored it again, “That I have something that you don’t.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>With that, she took Agatha’s hand and kissed the back of it, deliberate and taunting. Just as she predicted, Maria’s jaw clenched harder as her eye twitched. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah,” Rio hummed. “There it is.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Maria set her glass down hard, both hands on the table as she leaned closer, baring her teeth like a predator as her eyes grew impossibly darker, “You act like you’re so special, Rio, like you’ve done something so remarkable, but let’s not forget– you’ve always been a selfish, reckless, brat!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Something simmered deep inside Rio as her own jaw clenched, her hand leaving her wife’s as she sat up straighter, her shoulders squaring, her own voice coming out in a growl, “Selfish?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her sister’s eyes shimmered with something she couldn’t name but everything in Rio dropped with Maria’s next words, “Do you remember </span>
<em>
<span>that </span>
</em>
<span>night?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart stopped for a moment, the hair raising on her arms as her breath quickened.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>No, she wouldn’t</span>
</em>
<span>, Rio thoughts scrambled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t fathom this was where her sister was taking the conversation. Sure, they fought nastily, always with the jabs and aiming to tear each other down, but there was something else in her sister that Rio now saw. There wasn’t a mask of disgust or that look that told Rio that Maria was better than her. No, somehow this was worse. This was </span>
<em>
<span>real </span>
</em>
<span>anger combined with something the whole family shared– something they each dealt with privately, but Rio knew her sister’s grief led her to </span>
<em>
<span>this. </span>
</em>
<span>She couldn’t speak, couldn’t utter a word, couldn’t even signal </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>for help. Instead, Rio felt her mouth hang open, her eyes wide and fearful, her body tensing up like a deer in the headlights </span>
</p><p>
<span>Maria’s voice was laced with venom and melancholy, “The night you snuck out? </span>
<em>
<span>¿Cuándo te escapaste como siempre lo hacías? Te marchaste de Río, los dejaste en el hotel y no habrían estado allí si no fuera por ti.” </span>
</em>
<span>(When you snuck out like you always did? You left Rio, leaving them at the hotel and they wouldn’t have been there if it weren’t for you.) </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio could only hear her voice and the pounding in her ears as the weight of the words struck her like sharpened stones. Everything in Rio’s mind screamed as the faint smell of ash entered her senses. There was a flash of orange somewhere and loud yells from a firefighter telling someone to stop her. She blinked as tears welled up in her eyes and it was then, Rio realized why Maria was never close to her, why Maria always pushed her away, looked at her with disgust– it was because she blamed her for their parent’s death. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I was eight. I was eight. I was eight, </span>
</em>
<span>her mind chanted over and over again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>¿Y luego lo tienes todo? ¿Una esposa y ahora un maldito hijo?” </span>
</em>
<span>Maria dug the dagger deeper into Rio. (And then you have it all? A wife and now a fucking kid?)</span>
</p><p>
<span>But the dagger didn’t stop. Instead, it tore into her organs, plunging into her soul where her deepest regret lay buried. At one point she had </span>
<em>
<span>that </span>
</em>
<span>constant thought for years, until she accepted she was only eight, playing on in her mind like a broken record. </span>
</p><p>
<span> “</span>
<em>
<span>Deberías haber muerto con ellos.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>(You should have died with them). </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Everything died in that moment. The air became nonexistent and she swore the plants in their home started wilting around her, shrivelling before vanishing into dust. Her vision blurred as she flinched back, everything in her about to spring up and run, or spring up and launch herself across the table, she wasn’t sure. Everything around her slowed as she watched everyone’s reactions like she was outside of herself– like she was in the third person. Jack had grown rigid, looking at her sister with disbelief and maybe disgust– like he understood the words that were spoken. Oriana’s mouth was wide open, tears dripping down her face as her gaze was focused on the oldest. Her wife was stoic, not an emotion to be read on her face as she seemed to be processing the rancor from Maria’s words but </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita? Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>had a look she had never seen before. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, time started again and a coldness settled over Rio, as if she had been left outside in the middle of night during a snowstorm, and had been refused entry into the cabin. It was the final blow, the one she never had been ready for, the one she never imagined Maria would say aloud. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I should have died with them. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The words strangled her like a python squeezing the life out of its prey before delivering the final blow. Rio’s breath was ragged and then it hitched, a sharp inhale that barely made it through her lungs. Her fingers were trembling, her teeth starting to chatter. Now, she could truly hear it: the sirens, the screams, the explosion–</span>
</p><p>
<span>She still remembered the way the fire cackled at her, how the smoke forced her mouth open and filled her tiny lungs. There was the phantom feeling of large arms </span>
<em>
<span>dragging </span>
</em>
<span>her away from the heat that blistered her skin. Her own arms were flailing, screaming, fighting because she </span>
<em>
<span>had </span>
</em>
<span>to go back in– she had to get to them. The night had never left her, never truly left her despite so many times of shoving the memories into their retrospective boxes and burying them deep within her, and Maria had found it, shovelled it up with a few words. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A sharp </span>
<em>
<span>CRACK </span>
</em>
<span>snapped Rio out of her chasm of thoughts, the sound echoing through the room. </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita’s </span>
</em>
<span>hand was firm against the table as she stood, towering over Maria. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>¡Cállate la maldita boca, Maria!</span>
</em>
<span>” (Shut your damn mouth, Maria!) </span>
</p><p>
<span>The sheer fury in her grandmother’s voice was something none of the sisters had ever witnessed before, especially Rio for all of her years of being scolded or even doted on with tough love. This was rage in all of its glory, burying Maria in its hot ash like Pompeii had done to her victims. Her dark eyes burned further, turning Maria to stone, body frozen in time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>¡¿Cómo te atreves?!</span>
</em>
<span>” (How dare you?!) </span>
</p><p>
<span>Maria flinched… she </span>
<em>
<span>flinched. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>¿Diciendo esas cosas a tu propia hermana?</span>
</em>
<span>” (Saying those things to your own sister?) </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita’s</span>
</em>
<span> voice shook the room, her fury vibrating in every syllable. “</span>
<em>
<span>Eres una vergüenza. A tu familia, a tus padres, </span>
</em>
<b>
<em>a mí</em>
</b>
<em>
<span>.</span>
</em>
<span>” (You are a disgrace. To your family, to your parents, </span>
<em>
<span>to me</span>
</em>
<span>.) </span>
</p><p>
<span>Maria’s lips parted as if to argue, but </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>had other plans and no one interrupted the reigning monarch of the Vidal family, “</span>
<em>
<span>¿Quieres echarle la culpa a Rio? A una niña de ocho años, ¡cuando deberías estar mirando en un espejo, Maria!</span>
</em>
<span>” (You want to blame Rio? An eight-year-old child, when you should be looking in a mirror, Maria!) </span>
</p><p>
<span>Maria tongued at her cheek before her head tilted her eyes creasing, “</span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita</span>
</em>
<span>, I– ” </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>BANG! </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The entire table shook, the plates rattled, a wine glass shattered, and everyone, including </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita, </span>
</em>
<span>jumped. All heads snapped to Agatha whose hands had slammed down against the polish wood and Rio swore there were cracks underneath her palms. She radiated a power, even as her movements were slow, standing up, the chair screeching across the floor as she towered over everyone. If Agatha was a witch of fictional powers, Rio swore there would be lightning of purple crackling around her, a storm of a witch who reached her limit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she finally spoke, her voice was calm, but there was something else, something that even </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>flinched back away from her. Her voice was a weapon itself, carrying into the room before hitting its target with devastating accuracy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Get. Out.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Maria blinked as no one dared to move, but her wife didn’t waver, no– the woman didn’t blink, didn’t even glance at Rio whose heart was hammering so fast and her vision was blurring, she was sure she was going to pass out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But the sheer audacity of this bitch as she scoffed, “Oh, now you’re talking?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lip curled, “</span>
<em>
<span>You </span>
</em>
<span>do not come into my home, insult my wife, and then play the fucking victim.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Maria stood slowly, towering over her wife, but the only movement from her was a simple hand to her stomach which made Rio’s heart crack, but she could not move. She could not sit her </span>
<em>
<span>pregnant </span>
</em>
<span>wife down, who should be resting, who shouldn’t be on her feet for too long, who shouldn’t be dealing with the stress of the Vidal family. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Maria’s smile was evil as she leaned forward, “Oh, and now you’re defending her? After everything? How noble–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I said get out!” Agatha snarled, her voice vibrating through the room, reaching Rio’s very bones. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And for the first time, Maria staggered, her façade dropping as even Rio had never seen her wife </span>
<em>
<span>this </span>
</em>
<span>angry. She was seething like a cornered dog, her chest heaving, her hand rubbing circles on her stomach as if it was the only thing keeping her from launching herself across the table. </span>
</p><p>
<span> Agatha’s lips curled, her tone venomous, controlled, deadly, “You will </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> speak to </span>
<em>
<span>my</span>
</em>
<span> wife that way. You will not bring your unresolved grief, your bitterness, your own self-hatred and use it against her just because you’re too much of a coward to face it yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maria didn’t move. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t care what grudge you carry. I don’t care what </span>
<em>
<span>you </span>
</em>
<span>think justice is in life, or what you think my wife deserves. You don’t speak of our unborn child like that! And you sure as fucking hell don’t get to sit at </span>
<em>
<span>my </span>
</em>
<span>table in </span>
<em>
<span>my </span>
</em>
<span>house and decide whether my wife should be alive or not.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Once more no one spoke. Everyone’s breaths were trapped as Maria stared at Agatha, lips now pressing in a thin line. Her shoulders heaved and Rio now saw how glossy her sister’s eyes were. Her wife’s eyes burned holes into her skull, daring her to say something, to fight back, or do something reckless just so Agatha </span>
<em>
<span>could</span>
</em>
<span> launch herself across the table, and… it was every bit of the woman Rio had fallen in love with… a woman whose love was quiet, unshakeable, and came in a storm when matters called for it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Maria’s gaze flicked to Rio’s, to Oriana’s, and then to </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita</span>
</em>
<span>’s who just sat down, refusing her gaze, and with one final glance at Rio, she turned on her heel, heading towards the front door. Jack was on her heels, but no one else moved, not until the front door closed with a slam. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And it was only then did the breath return, but the first inhale was like inhaling the frigid air of the top of a mountain. Rio didn’t think, didn’t look, didn’t even realize her body was moving until she opened the door to their bedroom– until her legs gave out. She collapsed, her knees slamming into the carpet of their room as she buried her face into their quilt to muffle her screams as grief consumed her, as if she was there again, before the burning hotel, and instead of being that shocked eight-year-old girl, she was a thirty-three-year-old woman who had lost her parents. </span>

<strong>Ximena Vidal </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Ximena felt the breath leave her body as the words left her eldest grandchild’s mouth. She moved on instinct and in truth the rest was a blur until the sudden bang. She remembered her head turning, revealing her granddaughter’s wife in all her glory. A vein was throbbing from her forehead, her eyebrows pinched together painfully, and her fingers digging into the wood as her voice boomed through the house. She had sat down, feeling the power from the mother-to-be but moreso, the unconditional love the woman had for her granddaughter, but there was something more Ximena saw. She remembered their wedding well, how they had looked at each other– really looked at each. She remembered their vows, their first kiss as wives, and their first dance– the way they held each other… Ximena knew that Agatha Harkness was the love of her granddaughter’s life– and her dear Riocita, her wild, free-spirited, rebellious, and reckless granddaughter was the first to find her one. But the moment that had just passed, the power and love that radiated from Agatha made Ximena realize that this was more than unconditional love– this was two souls who were so entangled together, who were mirrors of each other, who were each other’s other half. </p><p>Rio Vidal found her soulmate.</p><p> </p><p>Ximena was glad that the eldest left, but some part of her broke. She always knew that the two sisters never got along, competing for her attention and approval and Ximena admitted that she wasn’t entirely fair with her granddaughters, but unlike Maria, Rio didn’t need coddling. Rio was the strongest of all of her grandchildren and Rio never ceased to amaze her, and now she was about to become a mother… but instead of celebrating, Maria had to ruin it and in that moment, Ximena felt like she lost a granddaughter. She had watched the woman she barely recognized leave before she heard the quick footsteps of her youngest running down the hall.</p><p>Maria struck Rio hard and Ximena knew even the strongest would crumble under what she had said. She stayed seated as Agatha turned, hurrying after her wife but the Oriana was also on the move. </p><p>“<em>Déjala, Ori,”</em> she said softly, making the middle sister freeze in her tracks. (Leave her, Ori.)</p><p>Oriana stared after Agatha’s retreating form until they heard the door close softly behind, but before they heard the click of the door, they both winced hearing the youngest granddaughter’s muffled sobs. </p><p>Oriana turned back to her, tears running down from her light brown eyes, “<em>Pero ella es mi hermana.</em>” (But she’s my sister.)</p><p>Ximena nodded her head slowly as her heart twisted at Oriana’s defeated voice– a voice that carried the weight of a sorrow that no words could truly untangle. Both of them felt the sudden change, the sudden unravelment of their family, and what was once strong, was now torn, but Maria? Maria made her choice and unless she came back crawling, Ximena did not have it in her to look at her. Oriana looked more torn, suffocated by pressure of being a twin and an older sister, but Ximena could see it– could see how Oriana was further from the twin she used to spend her every waking moment with. Maria’s words had not just struck Rio, but tore a wound so deep that even the strongest of hearts could not withstand– and Oriana, she truly was all heart.</p><p>Oriana’s eyes were clouded with unshed tears and she could only sigh, “<em>Ya lo sabes, mi niña. Pero ni siquiera las hermanas pueden arreglarlo todo. Sabes lo fuerte y terca que es Rio, pero permítele el espacio para que finalmente se abra paso con la seguridad que se merece–”</em>  (I know, my girl. But even sisters can not fix everything. You know how strong Rio is and how stubborn, but allow her the space to finally break in the safety she deserves–)</p><p>“<em>Pero yo soy su hermana</em>,” she repeated. “<em>Soy su lugar seguro</em>.”  (But <em>I</em> am her sister. <em>I</em> am her safe space–)</p><p>Ximena held up a hand to silence her, shaking her head. She allowed silence to fill between them as she studied the middle sister. Her lips quivered as her gaze narrowed back to the door where Agatha had disappeared, her fingers twitching at her sides. She followed her gaze as a soft smile graced her lips. </p><p>“<em>Los ves, Ori… ¿no? Ves la forma en que Rio mira a Agatha como si fuera la luna. Y Rio, claro que es un río, pero se convierte en un océano, sus olas se mueven únicamente para Agatha, se extienden hacia ella. Ves la suavidad en los ojos de Agatha cuando mira a Rio, la forma en que su luz solo brilla para su esposa, un amor como ningún otro. He visto la forma en que Rio ha cambiado por ella, cómo se ha suavizado, cómo ha encontrado la paz en su caos. Agatha es la luz que guía a Rio, su ancla, una presencia que le da estabilidad.”</em></p><p> (You see them, Ori… don’t you? You see the way Rio looks at Agatha like she is the moon. And Rio, sure a river, but she becomes an ocean, her waves solely moving for Agatha, reaching out to her. You see the softness in Agatha’s eyes when she gazes at Rio, the way her light only shines for her wife– a love like no other. I’ve seen the way Rio has changed for her, how she’s softened, how she’s found peace in her chaos. Agatha is Rio’s guiding light, her anchor, a grounding presence.) </p><p>“<em>¿Y María?</em>” she swallowed hard, her gaze dropping to the floor as they flinched again, hearing a sob echo from down the hall. (And Maria?)</p><p>“<em>Maria</em>,” she snapped, a little too harshly as Oriana winced but nevertheless held her gaze. “<em>Ella ya tomó su decisión. Ahora, come un poco. Démosle espacio a tu hermana pequeña</em>.” (She has made her choice. Now, eat a little. Let’s give your little sister some space.)</p><p> </p><p>They ate in silence. Oriana pushed her food around before Ximena snapped telling her to just eat. Neither of them could stomach the food though and eventually without a word, they stood and started cleaning up together. Ximena wrapped both Agatha’s and Rio’s plates for later, placing them in the fridge until both <em>Abuelita</em> and granddaughter were going through the unfamiliar space, searching for containers, finding where the plates went and the silverware.</p><p>Once everything was clean, the pair found themselves in the living room, Oriana flipping through Netflix as Ximena stood, staring down at the door. It had been almost two hours and she couldn’t stop the worry from eating away at her. It wasn’t like she could leave. Oriana checked and found that Maria had fled using the car they all came here with, and she knew Maria wasn’t going to come back, especially as half way through their cleaning, Oriana told her that she received a text from Jack letting them know that he had decided not to marry Maria but thanked them for their kindness. Ximena had smiled, happy for the boy to actually go find someone who would treat him right. Other than his lack of Spanish, he was a good man– too good for Maria. </p><p>The weight of anxiety gripped her chest, but without a word, she stepped down the hallway, her movements deliberate, sure– just as she had always been. She approached the door and, with the care she reserved for the most precious moments, turned the handle. The room inside was bathed in the soft glow of a single lamp, the space surprisingly immaculate. Rio, in her youth, would have never been so neat. </p><p>The sight of it almost felt unfamiliar. In the center of the room was a large bed, its covers a gentle tapestry of green and lavender, the colors interwoven like a quiet promise. And there, nestled into the warmth of the sheets, was her granddaughter. Her heart stilled as she watched <em>Riocita</em>, curled on her side, her face pressed into the skin of her wife’s neck, seeking comfort in the familiar embrace. Her hand moved in slow, gentle circles across Agatha’s belly– an act of love, of care, of quiet reverence. Agatha, equally curled, held Rio close, pressing soft kisses into her hair, each breath a testament to the calm that had settled over them both. Whatever tears had once fallen had dried, leaving only the peace of shared intimacy. </p><p>For a moment, Ximena felt like an intruder– a stranger in a room that should have felt like home. She had never seen Rio so small, so vulnerable. Even at eight, covered in soot, smelling of smoke and fire, Rio had always been a force of nature. Now, here she was– stripped of her walls, her strength laid bare, trusting someone else to hold the pieces of her together. Rio shifted, nuzzling deeper into Agatha, refusing to raise her head. Just as Ximena considered stepping away, Agatha’s eyes met hers, a soft, understanding smile spreading across her face. </p><p>“<em>Mi amor, Abuelita está aquí</em>,” Agatha whispered, her voice a tender thread of connection. </p><p>“<em>Querida, ven a la sala. Tenemos mucho de qué hablar. Deberíamos estar celebrando,</em>” Ximena said slowly, her words measured and calm. (Honey, come to the living room. We have a lot to talk about. We should be celebrating.)</p><p>Rio had spoken enough for the moment. It was time. Time to ease her granddaughter’s mind, to show her how proud she truly was. Rio had come so far– from a lost, soot-streaked child, to a rebellious teenager, to a reckless college student, to a wife– and now, to a mother-to-be. Ximena would ensure that this moment, this summit of Rio’s life, would not be clouded by doubts or shadows. She would hold it in her heart, and no one– no one– would take this joy from her granddaughter.</p><p> </p><hr/><p>
<strong>Rio</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>Her body twitched before her eyes flashed open, taking in her surroundings. She was in her room, the morning light just peaking through the blinds as her whole body felt heavy. Her eyes were strained, burning as she reached up, rubbing the crusts away before sitting up slightly. The moment she blinked again, the anger came rushing back, Maria’s words rattling in her brain and then came her wife’s soothing voice, her warmth wrapping around her as Rio cried for the first time over her parents’ deaths. She remembered the way her wife just held her without judgment, and only with a steady understanding, care, and love. When she finally managed to calm down, her wife reminded her of the cycle— how all things eventually lead to death and it was their time. </p><p>Rio knew to anyone else it would anger them, but Agatha knew her— knew she took soul comfort in the understanding of the green and the sacred balance. And with that, Rio relaxed, her tears ceasing and she knew it wasn’t her fault— but it didn’t stop the anger that radiated through her being. After all these years, after all the bickering, the stupid fights she and Maria had, she never knew it stemmed from the mere fact Maria thought she should have died too. </p><p>But in that moment, with her face tucked into her wife’s neck and her hands on her wife’s growing belly— all she could do was lean into it, revel in the love she had and life she had created. Agatha held her until <em>Abuelita</em> came in, inviting them back to the living room and the whole time, <em>Abuelita</em> looked at her with nothing but pride. They talked of the baby, possible names, the plans for the future, and then <em>Abuelita’s</em> approval of her wife’s choice of breastfeeding. They had laughed when <em>Abuelita</em> told Agatha to lift her shirt so she could check but Rio quickly stepped in when she realized <em>Abuelita</em> was serious about checking her wife’s breasts. </p><p>Her wife’s privacy would already be compromised enough from their future checkups and finally the birth where she knew her wife will be pissed when a doctor reaches their hands up her vagina. The least Rio could give her was to stop her <em>Abuelita</em> from doing— whatever she wanted to check. After a few words back and forth, her <em>Abuelita</em> stepped back before asking about doing a home birth which Rio had groaned telling her that they felt safer going to the hospital. More-so, Rio had done enough research to the point it made her sick thinking of the pain her wife would go through when she goes into labor. The idea of a natural birth made her stomach twist, wanting nothing more than her wife to not be in pain. Of course, the pain would be inevitable but if there was medicine to stop the majority of it, Rio wanted that for her wife. </p><p>In truth, that was all she remembered from last night— well except for when Agatha had to tell the story of her after anesthesia and how she had flirted non stop with Agatha. Oriana had gushed and Rio felt like her reputation was ruined by her own wife. Rio didn’t do soft, unless it was with Agatha Harkness. But after that, the rest was blurry and she guessed at that point, the exhaustion from her tears and anger won out and she must have fallen asleep in Agatha’s arms on the couch. </p><p>Rio turned beside her, finding her wife circled up against her, her face serene, a tiny snore leaving her mouth, and her body pressed against Rio further. A smile graced Rio’s lips as her hand came down, running through the tangles and smoothing it out, but the smile faded into concern as she wondered how she got in bed. She knew Agatha could carry her but <em>Abuelita</em> would never allow her— she couldn’t have allowed her. Yet, here she was in bed, in a white tank top and her boxers.</p><p>A soft hum made her gaze back down to her wife, realizing she was dreaming. Rio smirked, moving her body down so they were face to face as she watched as her wife’s eyebrows scrunched together. Rio cocked her head, wondering if Agatha was having nightmares again. She had woken her wife up from plenty in the past and was usually good at telling when one was going on but there was a different expression on Agatha’s face, one that spoke that she was confused and anxious. </p><p>Rio sighed, leaning forward and placing a soft kiss on her lips before moving to her cheeks, pepping her kisses there lightly to rouse her wife. For a moment, her wife protested before blinking open her eyes in a slight daze. Blue eyes blinked at her and Rio internally cringed. Perhaps it was not a nightmare and now her pregnant hormonal wife was going to kill her. She braced herself, but instead of her wife cussing her out for waking her up so early in the morning, a soft smile graced her lips. </p><p>Her wife leaned forward, capturing Rio’s lips in a sweet kiss. She felt her eyes close, a hand placed on her cheek to draw her closer. Rio moved her body closer, pressing up against her wife, smiling as her belly stopped her from being flushed against her. Rio reached down, her hand against the smooth skin as her thumb brushed over top of hers. </p><p>“I dreamt about you,” her wife murmured against her lips.</p><p>Rio smirked, knowing usually when she was in Agatha’s dreams, it usually led to slow morning sex. She pressed her nose against hers, getting blue eyes to open, finding her pupils blown. </p><p>Biting her lip, she whispered, “Tell me about it?”</p><p>Both hands were on her, one cupping her check, the other on her chest as her wife avoided her gaze now, a shy blush creeping in on her. </p><p>“We were in bed,” she started slowly. “I was on my back with you on top of me. We were kissing, your fingers inside me and mine inside you. It was perfect, you were so deep, so perfect. It didn’t take long and we came together. The moment I calmed down though, there was a cry. Not like you or I, but it came from down the hall. You smiled, pulling away and grabbing your robe. And you said simply that you would grab him and then someone woke me up.”</p><p>As she spoke Rio was pressing hot opened mouth kisses down her wife’s throat, but paused at the last sentence, peering up at her wife with wonder. Agatha smiled at her softly, caressing her cheek with tender hands. </p><p>“Soon, <em>mi amor,</em>” she whispered before her lips latched to hers. </p><p>A tongue licked into her mouth, hot and desperate, swirling with hers as she took in the perfect taste of her wife. She gasped but ultimately melted, moving over her until her wife was on her back. Hot hands moved up and down her sides, reaching under the white tank and cupping her breast. Rio sighed into it, her wife pulling her desperately closer but Rio held herself up, refusing to put weight on her wife. Instead, her hands wandered down, one moving between them and dipping underneath the silk underwear. Wiry hair scratched at her fingertips as they combed through before dipping into wet heat. </p><p>Agatha moaned loudly, her hips pressing up against Rio’s hand. Rio didn’t tease, not for morning sex when her wife should be pushing her away because of her morning breath. Her fingers moved languidly, moving from opening to clit, listening to her wife’s loud whines. Satisfied with the amount of wetness soaking her hand, two of her fingers slipped in easily, a soft sensation enveloping her digits as pushed them in and out at gentle pace. </p><p>She pulled away and was met with Agatha’s eyes closed, her mouth open in a silent ‘O’. She smiled, taking in her wife in her perfect beauty— the way her eyebrows scrunched together, her mouth open, and the baring of her neck. She wanted to caress her cheek, but she had to keep her body up off her belly. Instead, her nose nuzzled against her wife’s getting her to open those bright eyes. </p><p>“Look at me, <em>mi amor,</em>” Rio murmured, voice thick with adoration, with hunger. </p><p>Agatha obeyed, lashes fluttering as her gaze met Rio’s, pupils drowning out the blue. A sharp inhale left her lips as Rio curled her fingers just right, pressing against that spongy spot inside her that made her eyes close again.</p><p>Rio eased back, getting her wife to snap her eyes open again, locking onto hers as she slipped a third finger inside her, listening to the loud squelching of her pussy. She moved her hand, her arm at an awkward angle around her wife’s stomach and she stretched the silk of her ruined underwear. Finally, her palm hit her clit, making her wife moan louder. </p><p>“You’re so gorgeous like this— so soft, so wet and wanting, so full of life, carrying my child,” she husked down at her, her wife gasping.</p><p>Hands scrabbled at her Rio’s back, blunt nails digging in deep enough to leave crescent moons in caramel skin. </p><p>“Rio—”</p><p>Rio smirked, drinking in the sight of her— lips swollen, cheeks flushed, body writhing beneath her like she was made to be there. She leaned in, biting down on Agatha’s bottom lip before soothing it with her tongue. </p><p>”<em>¿Me sientes, cariño</em>?” Rio’s voice was a low hum, her fingers curling up again. (Do you feel me, darling?) </p><p>Agatha moaned, back arching, her hands gripping Rio’s shoulders tighter in reply. </p><p>“<em>Eso es, déjamelo todo a mí</em>.” (That’s it, leave everything to me.) </p><p>She quickened her pace, her fingers curling with each deep thrust as her palm rubbed her wife’s clit. She smirked as Agatha let out a sharp cry. Her head dipped down, kissing along the exposed collarbone from her wife’s own purple tank, relishing, savoring every sound, every tremor, every soaked feeling of her fingers pumping into her wife. </p><p>“<em>Tan apretada, tan perfecta para mí.</em>” (So tight, so perfect for me.) </p><p>She adjusted her hand now, knowing exactly what her wife needed. The sodden silk stretched with her hand, bunching against her knuckles as her thumb rubbed circles there on that sensitive bundle of nerves. It was deliberate but not rushing, pressing just how her wife liked. Her wife’s moans filled their bedroom, louder than usual for morning sex, but something in Rio beamed at thought knowing her wife was more reactive, more sensitive. </p><p>Trailing kisses along her jawline, she murmured, “<em>Quiero verte venir, sentir cómo te desmoronas en mis manos.</em>” (I want to see you come, to feel how you fall apart in my hands.) </p><p>Agatha’s breathing turned ragged, her body trembling. Her pussy squeezed Rio’s fingers painfully together as blue— almost black eyes snapped shut, her head shaking as her words were a babbling incomprehensible echo. </p><p>Rio smirked, whispering, “<em>Déjalo ir, mi vida. Dámelo todo.</em>” (Let go, my life. Give it all to me.) </p><p>With that, the dam snapped and Rio’s fingers were pushed out from the sheer strength as her wife came hard, squirting and yelling her name. Rio caught her, easing her through it as pressing kisses to her cheeks, whispering sweet nothings.</p><p>“<em>Eso es… tan hermoso cuando me lo das todo, mi amor. Te tengo— lo hiciste tan bien para mí.”</em> (That’s it… so beautiful when you give me everything, my love. I have you— you did so good for me.) </p><p>Her wife finally went still, her eyes remaining closed as her breath was heavy. Rio pulled her hand out from between them, sucking on her fingers watching as a blue peaked open to watch her. She smirked as her cheeks hollowed out, her tongue wrapping around the sweetest of her wife’s cum before pulling her fingers out with a pop. Her wife huffed at her but to her surprise, she felt a soft push on her chest, an ask for her to move. She did, her eyebrows furrowing with confusion as her wife simply shifted on her side, her eyes closed once more as her breathing evened out. </p><p>This time Rio didn’t hesitate to reach out, caressing her wife’s cheek, pressing soft kisses to her cheeks until Agatha came down. Her wife leaned forward there, kissing her lips, her tongue tasting herself inside Rio’s mouth. </p><p>“Are you alright, <em>mi vida</em>?” she asked, a hand going down to rub her wife’s belly. </p><p>Agatha nodded, saying softly, “Yes, I just don’t think I can be on my back anymore.”</p><p>She nodded, realizing her wife was truly growing. She smiled to herself, her gaze down at the swell of her stomach. She couldn’t wait to feel him kick, to feel the press of his tiny hands against her wife’s stomach, but something in her knew if he was anything like his mama, he was going to be handful. </p><p>She was brought out of her thoughts when velvet lips pressed against her neck, a hand moving along her ribs, but the realization of last night crept in slowly. They had barely eaten, especially Agatha who always ate at least two servings at dinner. Carefully, Rio pulled her away, kissing the pout off her lips. </p><p>“You need to eat, cariño. You barely ate last night.”</p><p>Her wife pouted again, leaning to kiss her neck again, but Rio placed a finger to her lips, raising a brow, “After, <em>cariño</em>. Please, you need to eat.”</p><p>Her wife finally groaned, rolling her eyes making Rio chuckle. Placing a delicate kiss to her cheek, Rio stood, heading out to their kitchen to make a large brunch. She moved into the rhythm, finding it calming her as it always had. She started the tea, and fetched the bacon from the fridge, allowing the sizzling of grease to fill the kitchen. Once they were done, she went back to mixing the last of the batter, but footsteps caught her attention and they weren’t the familiar foot falls of her wife. They were slow, too light, and too precise. </p><p>Rio snapped her head to meet the steady gaze oft <em>Abuelita</em> and her face drained of color. Her whisk dropped from her hand as she stared at her, seeing the rise of an eyebrow from her. She felt the increase of her heartbeat as her mind shifted to earlier— to how loud her wife was, how Rio talked her wife through it in Spanish, and how Agatha screamed her name as she came. Their walls were not entirely thin, but they weren’t thick either, and she had learned first hand that their voices tended to echo down the hall, having the one time came home late and her wife was enjoying the new vibrator Rio had gifted her. </p><p>“<em>Abuelita</em>,” she squeaked. “¿<em>Qué sigues haciendo aquí?</em>” (What are you still doing here?)</p><p>Her grandmother merely smirked at her, coming to the stove and taking the bacon off the pan. She laid the strips out with grace, lining them evenly on the plate with paper towels down to soak up the oil. </p><p>“<em>Bueno, tu hermana se fue con el coche y una vez que Oriana te llevó a la cama, tu esposa se desmayó contigo.”</em> (Well, your sister took off with the car and once Oriana carried you to bed, your wife passed out with you.)</p><p>She nodded slowly, beginning to mix the batter again as an uncomfortable silence set it. Rio’s movements were stiff, cringing away from <em>Abuelita</em> as this morning’s events played sharply in her mind. Maybe they were lucky and her sister and <em>Abuelita</em> slept downstairs in the basement, but she doubted it, knowing her <em>abuelita</em> liked the chair in their living room to sleep— hopefully, Oriana slept downstairs.</p><p>Rio heard another set of footsteps, looking up to see her older sister come in, a strange look on her face. Normally, Oriana was one of the worst morning people you could meet. She would be loud, laughing, a bundle of energy somehow, pulling those she loved into tight hugs talking immediately. Now, she refused Rio’s gaze as she made herself coffee in uncharacteristically silence. She let her go, finishing breakfast in a tense silence that had her nerves on fire. </p><p>A final familiar pair of footsteps padded into the kitchen, and Rio was quick with her tea, sliding it across the counter to her wife. That’s when she noticed Abuelita had left the kitchen some time ago, leaving Rio to simmer with her embarrassment. She was too caught up in it, she hadn’t realized both Oriana and Abuelita took their awkward presence to the living room. </p><p>Rio turned back to the stove, flipping the pancakes just as her wife wrapped her arms around her, pressing a kiss to the back of her neck. In that moment, she surrendered to the grounding touch as her wife’s nose dragged along the skin there, her hands moving back to trace the back tattoo. Rio pulled the pan off, turning in the wife’s hold. Their eyes met, Rio staring into tired adoring blue. </p><p>Arms wrapped around her neck, pulling her into a soft kiss, and like always, Rio melted, the racing of her heart easing to a steady rhythm. She pulled away though, quicker than her wife liked who immediately scowled at her. </p><p>“<em>Mi niña, ¿debería poner la mesa?” Abuelita</em> asked from behind her wife. (My girl, should I set the table?)</p><p>Agatha’s face went pale as the same realization dawned on her. Her eyes grew wide at Rio who kept a steady hand on the curve of her stomach. Rio nodded at her abuelita, refusing her gaze as her thumb traced careful circles there. Her wife’s hand came over hers, her eyes wide with mortification. </p><p>Before either could say a word, <em>Abuelita</em> came back into the kitchen, placing a hand on her wife’s back, “<em>Ven, no deberías estar parada tanto tiempo, mija.”</em> (Come, you shouldn’t be standing this long.)</p><p>Her wife was led away from her and into the dining room where Oriana grumbled passed her and followed them. Rio shook her head, her fingers pinching the bridge of her nose as she took a few calming breaths. Perhaps, they hadn’t heard anything and Oriana was just in a mood because of Maria. Rio grimaced at the thought of her eldest sister, the anger starting to boil as her fists tightened. Nails left bloodied crescents but ultimately soothed as her thoughts led her to the image of Maria getting hit by a bus… Regina George style. She smirked at the thought of getting that phone call. </p><p>She returned to their food, grabbing the stack of pancakes in one hand and the bacon in the other. No one spoke as she set it down, returning to the kitchen to bring the hot tea kettle over, some syrup, and cut up strawberries. As her usual routine, her body moved, coming beside her wife and placing a soft kiss on her cheek. Oriana made a noise, making Rio snap her head up at her. </p><p>“What?” she snapped.</p><p>Oriana shook her head, placing some bacon on her plate as <em>Abuelita</em> piled pancakes on her wife’s plate. Once everyone had their food in front of them, <em>Abuelita</em> straightened, regarding her with surprisingly tender eyes.</p><p>“<em>Agatha me dice que aún no has ido de compras para el bebé. Vamos después del desayuno, Riocita</em>,” she stated sternly. (Agatha tells me you haven’t gone shopping for the baby yet. We are going after breakfast, little Rio.)</p><p>Rio groaned, “<em>Abuelita, solo tiene quince semanas de embarazo. Tenemos tiempo.”</em> (She’s only fifteen weeks pregnant. We have time.)</p><p>“<em>Solo le quedan veinticinco semanas,” Abuelita</em> snapped. “<em>¿Has empezado siquiera una guardería? ¿Elegiste un tema? Además, necesitas que me asegure de que consigamos el extractor de leche adecuado para ella.”</em> (She only has twenty-five weeks left. Have you even started a nursery? Picked the theme? Plus, you need me to make sure we get the right breast pump for her.)</p><p>“<em>Ugh, Abuelita, por favor</em>,” this time it was Oriana who groaned. </p><p>The matriarch’s eyes snapped to the second oldest, “<em>No seas tan mojigata, Or</em>i.” (Don’t be such a prude, Ori.)</p><p>“¡<em>No soy una mojigata! Simplemente no necesitaba escuchar a mi hermanita—</em>,” Oriana snapped back before her lips drew in a tight line. (I’m not a prude. I just didn’t need to hear my baby sister—)</p><p>Then, she slammed her fork down, eyes wide with horror as she turned to Rio, her face twisted like she had witnessed something unspeakable. </p><p>“No,” she breathed, pointing a shaking finger at her younger sister. “We are not going to sit here and act like I didn’t wake up to—” she cut herself off with a strangled noise, shoving her hands into her hair. “Oh my God, I heard everything!” </p><p>Rio stiffened mid-chew, feeling the blood drain from her face.</p><p>“Oriana,” she warned.</p><p>“No!” Oriana shrieked, slamming both hands down on the table like a woman on the brink of madness. “Do you have any idea what I woke up to this morning? Do you—?” </p><p>She broke off, shaking her head so violently the short ends of her hair moved, “I will never be able to look at you the same, <em>hermanita</em>.”</p><p>Across the table, Agatha was completely unbothered, sipping her tea with a knowing smirk. Rio, however, wished the earth would swallow her whole. That the roots of the trees would break through their hardwood floors and drag her into the mud away from this.</p><p>“I—” she gulped. “I don’t—” </p><p>Oriana whirled on Agatha now, eyes blazing with betrayal. </p><p>“And you!” she pointed accusingly at Agatha’s growing belly. “You’re pregnant! How do you even have the energy for that?!” </p><p>Agatha raised an elegant brow, completely unimpressed, “I have my ways.” </p><p>Oriana let out a wail, throwing her head back dramatically, “To the mother, I need therapy!” </p><p>Rio groaned, covering her face with both hands, the red burned her cheek as she wanted nothing more than to go back in time and stop herself. She would burst through the room, wake herself up before her wife woke up and stop this whole mess.</p><p><em>Abuelita</em>, who had been quietly buttering a pancake, finally spoke, her voice calm and entirely unbothered, “<em>Pues, al menos sé que mi Riocita está cuidando bien a su esposa.</em>” (Well, at least I know my little Rio is taking good care of her wife.) </p><p>Oriana gasped like she had been personally attacked, “<em>¡Abuelita! ¿En serio?!”</em> (Seriously?!) </p><p><em>Abuelita</em> simply shrugged, biting into her pancake, “<em>¿Qué? Así es el matrimonio.</em>” (What? That’s marriage.) </p><p>Oriana screamed into her hands as Rio choked on her drink when she felt a hand on her thigh. Fingers gave her upper thigh a light squeeze before rubbing towards her inner thigh. Rio shook her away, throwing her a look, but her wife didn’t care, barely hiding her amusement</p><p>She was completely shameless, reaching for the syrup before flashing the smirk at Rio, “Pass the bacon, my love.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">*** </p><p> </p><p>The moment they stepped into the baby store, Rio realized she had made a grave mistake. Shopping with her family was a different type of torture— one she was sure could have been used during the Inquisition. First, <em>Abuelita</em> had demanded that Rio push Agatha around in a wheelchair, which both Rio and Agatha had immediately shot down. Agatha wasn’t bedridden— she was pregnant, not incapacitated. She could still walk, still move, still exist without being carted around like some delicate Victorian maiden. But Gods, that didn’t stop <em>Abuelita</em> from clicking her tongue every time Agatha so much as paused to rub a hand over her belly. </p><p>“<em>Mija, ¿estás cansada? ¿Deberíamos descansar?</em>” (Are you tired? Should we rest?)</p><p>“<em>Mija, no levantes eso— Río, ¡tómalo para ella!</em>” (Don’t lift that— Rio, grab it for her!)</p><p>“<em>Mija, estás creciendo, mi bisnieto, ¡deberías estar sentado!</em>” (You’re growing my great-grandson, you should be sitting down!)</p><p>It was endless. And as if that wasn’t bad enough, Oriana— still deeply traumatized from this morning’s events— was no help at all. She scowled every time Rio placed a hand on her wife from soothing touches to her stomach, to a hand on the small of her back, and even to when Rio placed a light kiss on her wife’s forehead. </p><p>The nightmare only grew when they reached the things for the nursery. <em>Abuelita</em> and Oriana were fighting in the middle of the store about what colors they wanted and what the theme should be without regard for the actual parents. Rio and Agatha sat back rolling their eyes and walking to the next aisle where without a word or even the slightest bit of a conversation, they decided they were going to do a forest theme for the nursery with the addition of stars and moons. It was a moment where Rio felt herself relax— her and her wife were on the same page without words. </p><p>When <em>Abuelita</em> and Oriana found them, they finally relaxed, seeing them pick out decorations and talking about paint. It wasn’t even an argument. Rio said she wanted the walls a grass green and Agatha agreed. Agatha said she wanted a star and moon mobile and Rio nodded, saying she would look on Etsy. They both said the bedding would be purple but the only issue was the crib which both Rio and Agatha agreed none of the cribs they came across would do. </p><p>Somehow, Rio convinced <em>Abuelita</em> not to buy clothes yet in case her son was actually a daughter— not that she really cared about the gender but, Rio had a bet to win. Her <em>abuelita</em> had simply smacked her saying that she was never wrong and that Agatha was most certainly carrying her great-grandson. </p><p>The real nightmare hit its climax when <em>Abuelita</em> dragged them all down the aisle where breasts pumps were. Rio never wanted more than anything to bash her head into a wall, or be horizontal in grave as even her wife grew bright red— her wife who would only react to Rio, was now the brightest shades of pink, her mouth parted open, as her eye grew wide in embarrassment and disbelief. Yet somehow, Oriana’s expression was the one of pure mortification. The moment <em>Abuelita</em> started talking about suction power or how one machine mimicked the suction of a baby, she was gone. </p><p>Rio and Agatha stood there rigidly, thanking all of the Gods that <em>Abuelita</em> refused to speak English as she went over the descriptions of each electronic pump. Eventually, the one that mimicked the suction of a baby was placed in the cart, along with a smaller portable one and a hand pump if they ever needed it. Rio was sure her and her wife would happily agree to the afterlife the moment they went to check out and it was one of their old students. If it was one of their current students, Rio was sure they both would have passed away on the spot. </p><p> </p><p>By the time they got everything in the house, Rio guided her wife into their bedroom for a nap. Before she left her, she placed a longing kiss to her wife’s lips where, the moment her head hit the pillow, she was out, snoring lightly. Rio adjusted her pillows, placing one behind her back and another for her belly to rest on. She knew she should have fought her wife harder on buying her the pregnancy pillow. Rio wouldn’t always be there as her wife’s personal pillow, no matter how much Rio adored having that perfect belly on her while they slept. </p><p>Rio turned her gaze to her wife’s belly. A hand came over it, rubbing it softly as her wife smiled in her sleep. Rio chuckled, kissing the gentle swell of it before heading back into the living room where Oriana was passing out tea. She sat down with them, sighing and closing her eyes. A warm hand made her freeze, and she opened her eyes to <em>Abuelita</em> staring at her with nothing but affection and pride. </p><p>“<em>No te culpo, Riocita. Lo que sucedió fue parte del ciclo. Era su momento y no era el tuyo. Los estás haciendo sentir orgullosos y cuando tu hijo finalmente llegue, serás una excelente madre</em>,” her abuelita’s voice was quiet and firm, carrying all the assurance understanding a human could be capable of and more. (I don’t blame you, little Rio. What happened was a part of the cycle. It was their time and it was not yours. You’re making them proud and when your son finally comes, you will be a wonderful mother.)</p><p>Rio finally broke again, but this time not out of grief, not out of anger of her sister, but simply hearing the words from her abuelita. She hiccuped as her tears ran down her face, drowning her eyes where everything became blurry. The withered hands wiped them away as Rio put a hand to her mouth trying to cover her sobs. Instead, <em>Abuelita</em> pulled her hand away and wrapped her arms around her, holding her close. Her body shook as she buried her face into <em>Abuelita’s</em> shoulder and for a moment she felt like a teenager all over again. </p><p>It wasn’t often that Rio would sob like this when she was a teenager, unsurprisingly, she was always angry and cold. But when she did break, when she couldn’t hold it all together, <em>Abuelita</em> was there without judgement, holding the pieces together that Rio desperately clung to as if she was over the edge of a cliff, holding the thread by its thinnest part, begging it not to fall. <em>Abuelita</em> would be there, pulling her back and taking the thread as if it weighed nothing and would wrap Rio into her arms, sewing her back together. </p><p><em>Abuelita</em> was always the one without judgement when it came to her. At least to the things that mattered to Rio. When she was caught with a girl in her bed, Abuelita didn’t blink. When Rio went through her first, very cliche- very traumatizing, sapphic breakup, <em>Abuelita</em> knew and made Rio’s favorite tea and together they sat down and watched a nature documentary. However, when Rio got tattoos and piercings— got caught with weed, she received a long lecture and a few harsh slaps to the back of her head, worst case the <em>chancla</em>. She was hit hard the day she revealed she’s been dating Agatha for three years and never once mentioned her. And then hit again when <em>Abuelita</em> met Agatha and was enamoured by the fact she spoke Spanish. Agatha had laughed at her. </p><p>She clung tighter to her <em>abuelita’s</em> forest green sweater, taking in the sweetness that was the familiarity of her perfume. Hands moved through her hair as her shoulders shook, her sobs loud, but muffled into her sweater, probably spreading her snot and make up on it, but she didn’t care, because <em>Abuelita’s</em> warmth, her love, her safety was everything. She felt a hand on her back and knew it was her sister. And slowly, Rio melted into the perfect embrace that was her family. </p><p> </p><p>Oriana convinced <em>Abuelita</em> to leave Rio and Agatha that night, telling her there was more to do later with them and they would plan dinners later. Oriana had booked an Uber and a new hotel, one closer to Rio and Agatha’s and away from Maria. Oriana was also due to meet Jack and to pick up the ring from Maria to return it to him. She wondered how nasty that fight would be and prayed that Oriana would finally grow a spine to tell the cunt off. </p><p> </p><p>Her steps were slow and heavy as she walked down the hall to her bedroom to check on her wife. In truth, everything in her screamed to lie down with her and fall asleep with her wife in her arms, but she had to make dinner and she knew her wife would be hungry soon. Instead of meeting the darkness of her room and her wife lying in bed, Rio found the lights on, and her wife was gone. </p><p>Panic crept in fast, flowing up her veins from her hands and feet and straight to her throat. Then, her hearing clicked to the sound of water running and the light humming of her wife from the bathroom. She approached slowly, expecting to find her wife in the tub, but instead, she was knelt on the ground, dressed in sweatpants and a sweatshirt with her long hair down to her waist. </p><p>Rio stared for a moment, leaning against the door frame watching her. Candles flickered around them, the low glow highlighting the perfect curve of her wife’s nose, her sharp jawline, and the gentleness in her wife’s eyes. She watched as a slender hand, the hands she would always drool over, with a few perfect veins shining through the skin, made its way under the water before reaching for the bubbles— Rio’s bottle of bubbles. It was a pine scent with some type of woody undertone that Rio adored. Her wife was methodical and attentive, pouring in the perfect amount before flicking on the jets. </p><p>Rio shifted her weight, causing the tile underneath her foot to creak. Blue eyes stared up at her, a knowing smile on her lips as a hand reached out towards her. Rio took it, allowing her wife to pull her closer before raising the other hand, a silent ask to help her stand up. </p><p>“What’s all this, <em>mi amor</em>?” she asked, her voice coming out more shaky than she wanted. </p><p>Agatha tilted her head, before cupping her cheeks with both hands and suddenly, her vision blurred. She blinked rapidly, feeling the tears spill over and her wife’s careful thumbs were brushing them away. </p><p>“Don’t think I didn’t hear you, my love,” she spoke softly as Rio grasped at her wrists, licking away the tears that Agatha missed. </p><p>Her eyes fluttered closed as her wife kept her tender grip on her cheeks. More tears flowed as lips pressed to hers, ignoring the saltiness that probably laid there and maybe even Rio’s snot as she sniffed hard. </p><p>“Let me take care of you, my love. You deserve the world and more—”</p><p>“You are my world—”</p><p>Her wife rolled her eyes, “Don’t get sappy on me now, Vidal.”</p><p>“Harkness-Vidal,” she corrected, a small smile tugging at her lips, but it was weak as more tears flowed. “And you like me sappy.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head in defeat before pulling her into another gentle kiss. When they pulled away, her wife’s hands dropped to Rio’s black shirt, lifting it over head before starting at her jeans, unbuttoning them and the zipper undone. Before she could get further, Rio stopped her, taking them off herself along with her socks and throwing them in the hamper. A finger hooked on her boxers, her <em>Plants VS Zombies</em> pair that her wife got her as a joke. She had changed into them after this morning with her wife, her regular ones ruined. </p><p>Soon, she was standing naked before her wife and all Rio felt was safety and warmth, despite the cold air making her nipples stiff. When Agatha tried to lead her into the tub, Rio stopped her, pulling at the sweatshirt.</p><p>“My love,” her wife stopped her with a hand on hers. “This is for you. Please, <em>cariño</em>, let me take care of you tonight and then you can go back to being my overprotective wife.”</p><p>Rio only shook her head, “You can take care of me by joining me, my love.”</p><p>Her wife sighed in defeat, allowing Rio to undress her and the moment her belly was on display, Rio’s hands were like a magnet, both hands resting there and caressing the skin. She smiled, already noticing the faint red lines of stretch marks blossoming. Her thumb brushed over them, a stupid grin on her face. Before she could think, she knelt down before her wife, her lips pressing kisses to them. </p><p>“Gods, <em>mi amor</em>, you are so beautiful” a kiss was placed on a dark line “so stunning” another to a smaller web forming “so perfect,” and a final one to the other side where the stretch mark was darker. </p><p>She looked up, finding tears in her wife’s eyes, as she laughed lightly, shaking her head, “Goddamnit, Rio, I’m supposed to be taking care of you.”</p><p>Rio pulled her underwear down before standing up before her wife, pulling her flushed against her, “We will take care of each other then.”</p><p>Agatha pushed her, shaking her head as tears poured faster down her cheeks, “Just get in the damn tub.”</p><p>She laughed lightly, stepping into the hot water before extending the arm to her wife. She lowered them slowly, her skin stinging slightly, from the hot water. Her wife always made the baths a little too hot but it was perfect, easing the ache in her body and once Agatha’s back pressed to her front, it eased the ache in her heart. </p><p>Her wife ducked her head underneath Rio’s chin as the sound of bubbles and soft breaths filled the room. Rio gathered her wife’s hair, using a hair tie off her wrist to put it in a low bun, the ends already dripping, but her wife didn’t seem to care. Then, Rio’s hands subconsciously found her wife’s stomach, rubbing gentle circles there as the last of anger and hurt left her body</p><p>Rio was right where she belonged. She was with her wife and unborn child, holding them close and knowing, wherever her parents were, they would be proud. And her mother would be so shocked to see <em>Abuelita</em> cry, or maybe she wouldn’t. She wondered what happened when they told <em>Abuelita</em> they were going to have a third kid. Did <em>Abuelita</em> cradle her the moment she landed in her awaiting hands as a newborn, swaddle her in a green blanket before being placed in her mother’s arms? Yet, all she knew was that when <em>Abuelita</em> would hold her son for the first time, they would form an unbreakable bond the moment he looked at her. </p><p>She kissed the side of her wife’s head, missing the hitch of breath from her and the way Agatha tensed. A hand came underneath Rio’s rubbing in circles before a louder hitch of breath made her thoughts cease as she lifted her head abruptly.</p><p>“Agatha? What’s wrong?” she sat up, one hand on her belly, the other cupping her cheek, but her wife didn’t turn to look at her.</p><p>No, she was staring at her stomach confusion knitting her eyebrows together. Rio’s heart raced as she waited for her wife to speak. She pulled her closer, nuzzling into her wife’s neck to calm her own nerves so she could be there for her wife. </p><p>“It’s- it’s too early, right?” Agatha’s voice wavered as her blues glistened with tears.</p><p>“Too early for what, <em>mi amor</em>?”</p><p>Agatha sucked in a breath for saying almost too quietly, “Too feel them?”</p><p>Rio’s heart stopped as her mouth opened, her voice in quiet awe, “No, um, it’s rare but not uncommon or unusual. What do you feel?”</p><p>“Fluttering, everytime you stroke your thumb,” her wife replied, making Rio press a gentle circle at the swell. </p><p>Her wife gasped again before letting out a soft laugh, “Oh, my love, I feel them. They’re there.”</p><p> </p><p>
<em>They’re there.</em>
</p><p> </p><p><em>He’s there.</em> </p><p> </p><p>Their son, quietly making himself known to his mama and soon to his <em>mami.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p>

<strong>William</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>William stood straight and tall, gazing out the window into the night. His shift had barely begun– only two hours in– and already, exhaustion clung to him like a second skin. He and Ireland had been roped into working at his parents’ new restaurant, a place that leaned into the witchy charm of Westview. “The Tarot of the Lovers” –a name so sickeningly romantic that William wanted to gag. The concept was simple, painfully so. It was a restaurant designed for couples. Instead of chairs, velvet loveseats were placed, forcing people to sit shoulder-to-shoulder, their hands free to wander, their gazes locked in dreamy, lovesick exchanges. The menu? Equally nauseating. Every dish was crafted for sharing. If one partner craved seafood carbonara and the other wanted chicken Alfredo, each would receive a half portion, perfectly placed so they could– of course– feed each other. William found the whole thing ridiculous, overpriced, and a blatant cash grab. But, to his dismay, it worked. His parents were making an absolute fortune. </p><p>It was the third night since opening, the day before Christmas Eve, and the place was packed. William was darting between tables like a man possessed, dodging flirty touches, rolling his eyes at whispered sweet nothings, and doing his best to ignore couples getting a little too comfortable. He and Ireland, however, had found a silver lining: the drama. They lived for it. Husbands arguing in hushed voices, girlfriends shooting death glares across the room, the subtle tension of an affair unraveling right before their eyes– it was all prime gossip material. </p><p>Finally, William found a moment of reprieve at the hostess stand, inhaling deeply before scanning the list of upcoming reservations. One table remained open, nestled by the window, its occupants due to arrive at any moment. Ireland scribbled notes beside him, her expression neutral, though William could tell she was just as eager as he was to finish this night. </p><p>“Who’s my next couple?” he asked, leaning against the podium. </p><p>Ireland scrolled down the list but didn’t get the chance to answer. The chime of the doorbell cut through the chatter of the restaurant, and when William turned his head, his breath caught in his throat. A woman in a tailored red suit stepped through the entrance, each click of her heels resonating against the hardwood floors. The fabric hugged her frame effortlessly, the flared pants giving way to impossibly long legs. A single button fastened the blazer, revealing a hint of lace from a black bra underneath, and across her collarbones, black ink swirled in elegant designs. Her dark eyes landed on them, cold and assessing, before she turned slightly as the door chimed again. Another woman stepped inside– just as stunning, yet in an entirely different way. She was wrapped in a sleek black dress that traced every curve, the neckline plunging in a way that should have been scandalous but somehow remained impossibly elegant. Her chestnut hair cascaded down her back to her waist in thick waves, and around her neck sat an amethyst pendant, the symbol of the Triple Goddess shimmering in gold. </p><p>But it wasn’t her beauty that had William’s eyes bulging– it was the roundness of her stomach, cradled naturally by one hand as she reached for the other woman, their fingers lacing together with ease. His stomach dropped. The woman in red– the one with the piercing gaze and icy expression– spoke first. </p><p>“Reservation for Rio Harkness-Vidal.” </p><p>
<em> Harkness-Vidal.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Harkness-Vidal.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Harkness.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Vidal.  </em>
</p><p>William’s brain short-circuited. He barely registered Ireland’s sharp inhale beside him, too lost in his own realization. His professors. Dr. Vidal. Dr. Harkness. Married. And now– <em> holy shit– Dr. Harkness was the one pregnant </em>. </p><p>He glanced at Ireland, her eyes darting between the couple in rapid succession, her face draining of color. William knew exactly what was running through her mind: the mortifying memory of accusing Dr. Vidal of being pregnant when– right here, in front of them– the answer had been obvious all along. He kicked her, snapping her out of it, and she straightened, clearing her throat as she put on her best customer service smile. </p><p>“Dr.– I mean, Mrs. and Mrs. Harkness-Vidal,” she greeted smoothly, “welcome to <em> The Tarot of the Lovers. </em> Mr. Kaplan will be your server tonight. If you follow him, he will show you to your table.” </p><p>Neither of them acknowledged her attempt at warmth. If anything, Dr. Vidal’s expression remained unreadable as William grabbed a menu and led them through the dimly lit restaurant. He placed the menu down at the secluded table before stepping aside. He barely concealed his awe as Dr. Vidal– ice-cold and intimidating to students– turned to her wife with a breathtaking smile. To him it was foreign, unreal, a look that didn’t belong on her face, and yet here she was, a smile that was downright devastatingly charming. Then, just to add to the foreignness of it all, Vidal extended a hand as if she was presenting royalty, guiding Dr. Harkenss into her seat, sitting her down with grace before taking her place beside her. Harkness didn’t move as Vidal immediately had their thighs touching, their shoulders brushing as she opened the menu for them. The contrast was staggering. </p><p>William swallowed hard, grasping for professionalism, “If I may offer the wine of the night, a Chardonnay straight from Burgundy, France–” </p><p>He held up the bottle, ready to pour it into Dr. Harkness’ glass but paled as a hand covered the glass, an amethyst ring shining up at him. </p><p>“We’re fine, thank you,” Dr. Vidal said sharply, her attention still focused on the menu. </p><p>He nodded quickly, “I’ll give you two a moment.” </p><p>He hurried back toward Ireland, gripping the wine bottle like it had personally betrayed him. When he reached her, their eyes met in mutual horror. </p><p>“They’re married.”</p><p>“Dr. Harkness is pregnant.”</p><p>They spoke at the same time, whispering like they were uncovering classified government secrets. From across the room, they could just make out the couple in their quiet conversation. Dr. Vidal murmured something, her hand instinctively stroking over Dr. Harkness’ stomach, while the latter rolled her eyes and swatted her away. It should’ve been a mundane interaction, but there was something about it– an easiness, a familiarity– that made William’s stomach twist. Ireland, however, was stuck in her own spiral. </p><p>“Oh my God, William, I fucking accused Dr. Vidal of being pregnant and it was her wife– her wife who is the Purple witch– this whole time– the whole fu—” </p><p>His hand shot out, slapping over her mouth before she could complete the sentence. Nearby guests glanced at them, and William forced a sheepish smile before removing his hand. </p><p>“Lower your voice,” he hissed. “They don’t even recognize us. Plus, Vidal just shooed me away after I offered them wine–” </p><p>“You offered them what?” Ireland screeched, then promptly burst into laughter. </p><p>William frowned, “What’s so funny?”</p><p>She wiped at her eyes, still giggling, “William, pregnant people can’t drink alcohol. How do you not know this?” </p><p>He shrugged, “How am I supposed to know? It’s not like I pay attention to women.” </p><p>Ireland rolled her eyes, but sighed, “Fair. Before you go back, don’t offer her caffeine, alcohol, or anything with raw fish. If you’re unsure, just ask about dietary restrictions. Honestly, Vidal strikes me as the type to avoid anything Harkness can’t eat.” </p><p>That part, at least, made sense. William nodded, turning back toward their table. But then he stopped, something catching his eye. Dr. Harkness was gazing at her wife with a softness that didn’t match the sharp, unyielding woman he knew from class. Dr. Vidal– always so composed, so untouchable– leaned in, brushing a strand of hair from her wife’s face with a touch so gentle it nearly made William feel like he was intruding. </p><p>Vidal was the first to move, tilting forward to claim her wife’s lips in a kiss that was neither rushed nor hesitant– just effortlessly natural. Harkness followed with ease, their connection resonating with a quiet intensity. It wasn’t as drawn-out or dramatic as some of the other couples in the restaurant, yet it carried a weight that made it feel more profound. He froze, his eyes impossibly widening as he stared at the professors that actively made his and his classmates’ lives hell. They were not just married, they were a perfect match.</p><p>When they finally parted, William discreetly placed a basket of warm bread and a dish of oil on their table. </p><p>“Shall we start with drinks?” he asked, attempting to sound casual. </p><p>“Water is fine,” Harkness answered smoothly, her tone leaving little room for discussion. </p><p>“And have you decided on your meal?” William swallowed hard, his gaze flickering– unbidden– to Harkness’ rounded stomach. </p><p>He tensed when Vidal’s hand swept over it in a slow, absent-minded caress. For a moment he feared that she had caught him staring, but no. Her focus remained on the menu, her fingers tracing gentle circles over her wife’s belly as if the motion was second nature. Harkness, for her part, didn’t even acknowledge it. She was scanning the menu too, completely unfazed. </p><p>Vidal finally looked up, her gaze cold, “What do you recommend? No fish, no raw dairy, and nothing with soft cheese.” </p><p>William nodded, regaining his composure, “The wedding soup is a favorite. It’s served in a large bowl for two to share. I also highly recommend the beef stroganoff or the chicken carbonara. If you’d prefer something heartier, the steaks here pair wonderfully with a creamy mushroom sauce, and the schnitzel comes with a rich pomegranate glaze.” </p><p>Vidal closed the menu without hesitation, nodding, “We’ll have the wedding soup and the beef stroganoff. Absolutely no red in the meat.”</p><p> William took the menu from her, his brow creasing slightly. She hadn’t even checked with Harkness? He cast a glance between them, curiosity stirring. Everyone knew Vidal was a control freak in the classroom, but so was Harkness– how did that balance work? More than that, why was Harkness so comfortable letting Vidal decide for them both? He thought back to the murmurs about what had happened between Vidal and Maximoff, about how Vidal had snapped. Then, to how she had immediately taken Harkness’ hand, fingers locking together with quiet possession, or how her palm had barely strayed from the curve of her wife’s belly. Shaking his head, he punched in their order and returned to Ireland, his expression pensive. </p><p>She arched her brow, “What?” </p><p>He hesitated for a moment before muttering, “Vidal seems like a control freak.” </p><p>Ireland snorted, “Yeah? And you’re just now realizing that?” </p><p>“No, I mean with Harkness. She seems… I don’t know, possessive? She just ordered for them without asking, and her hand is constantly on her stomach.” </p><p>Ireland groaned, exasperated, “Dude, she’s pregnant with Vidal’s baby. Of course her hand is on her stomach– she’s probably soothing cramps, or if the baby’s moving, she’s feeling that.” </p><p>“No, just… just watch them,” William insisted, nodding toward their table. </p><p>They both turned in time to see Vidal tuck a stray strand of hair behind Harkness’ ear, murmuring something that made the literature professor roll her eyes. Harkness said something back, her tone sharp, and pushed Vidal away lightly, exasperation flickering across her face. </p><p>“See?” William whispered. </p><p>Vidal, undeterred, simply smirked, reaching out to tilt her wife’s chin up with a single finger. Harkness huffed but didn’t resist, rolling her eyes once more before reaching for a piece of bread. </p><p>Before William could comment, someone called out, “William, your water for table six.” </p><p>With a sigh, he grabbed the tray and made his way over, catching a snippet of their conversation as he poured. </p><p>“My love, don’t be ridiculous– I’m perfectly fine working at eight months. Plenty of other women do it,” Harkness said smoothly. </p><p>Vidal shook her head,“You’re not other women, and we get paid leave. I already have everything scheduled with Pepper. At six months, you’re taking maternity leave.” </p><p>Harkness scoffed, “Rio–” </p><p>“Agatha,” Vidal interrupted, voice edged with warning. </p><p>Harkness flicked her hair back, “Just because you’re my boss doesn’t mean you get to dictate this.” </p><p>Vidal’s smirk deepened, “Oh, it absolutely does, <em> mi amor </em>.” </p><p>William expected irritation from Harkness, maybe another protest. Instead, the literature professor’s lips curled in a way that sent a glint of challenge into her eyes. </p><p>“So does that mean you’re going on break with me?” </p><p>Vidal’s sharp features suddenly softened. Her head tilted slightly to the side as her hand now moved in slower, more deliberate circles over her wife’s belly. </p><p>Her eyes sparkled and her voice dipped in a tender softness, “Of course, <em> cariño </em>. The few classes we have will be partnered with other professors. Dr. Kale has already agreed to combine her sophomore class with ours, and Dr. Crawdad is thrilled to take over for you.” </p><p>Harkness stilled, her eyes darkening, “You told Crawdad? The bird couldn’t keep its mouth shut even if you cut it off.” </p><p>William winced, recognizing Dr. Harkness’ brutal bluntness, but Vidal didn’t even flinch. No, the woman merely laughed.</p><p>“We knew it would come out eventually, <em> cariño </em>. That’s what you told me.” </p><p>Harkness huffed but softened when Vidal pressed a lingering kiss to her cheek, entirely unconcerned with William standing awkwardly beside them. Taking that as his cue, he shuffled away, his mind reeling from the interplay between them– the push and pull, the bite and the tenderness, the sharp edges that somehow softened against each other. He found himself glancing back at them throughout the evening. When he finally returned with their soup, Vidal had both hands on Harkness’ stomach, thumbs stroking slow, lazy patterns as if drawn there by instinct. </p><p>“Ah, <em> mijo </em>–” </p><p>“You don’t even know if it’s a son, my love,” Harkness interrupted with another roll of her eyes. </p><p>Vidal only grinned, “<em> Abuelita nunca se equivoca. Vamos a tener un hijo. Admite la derrota ahora, mi amor.”  </em></p><p>William blinked, not understanding what she had said as he set the hot bowl down, grabbing the professional cheese grater as Harkness didn’t miss a beat. </p><p>“<em> Sigue regodeándose y descubre qué pasa esta noche,” </em>she hissed back at her wife before Vidal snapped his gaze up at him. </p><p>He flinched as she flicked him away with a simple twist of her wrist. William made his rounds to the other tables, receiving kinder interactions from the couples, but his gaze remained on them. Harkness’ eyes lingered, sharp and heavy, filled with something that William couldn’t quite grasp yet. The intensity in her eyes as she watched Vidal– tender yet possessive– made his stomach tighten. His mind scrambled, caught somewhere between confusion and fascination, as though he’d stumbled into an unspoken language. </p><p>Vidal, seeming to block out the rest of the world, met the gaze without hesitation. There was something unspoken between them, a connection woven into the very air, thick and potent. The woman was entranced by her wife, her eyes soft with adoration, her fingertips grazing over the pregnant woman’s skin as if the very act grounded her. </p><p>“Let’s see how you fare tonight, love,” Vidal teased, her voice low, playful, yet carrying that unshakable authority William had learned to fear. </p><p>But Harkness, as always, played the game with a deadly grace. She leaned in, brushing her lips against Vidal’s cheek with a quiet promise– a promise he could feel, even from where he stood. The edges of their words and touches wrapped together, a mixture of love and tension that William, still fumbling in his own confusion, could only observe. He quickly averted his gaze, shaking his head as though he could dislodge the sharp awareness prickling down his spine. But there was no avoiding the simmering charge in the air, the kind of quiet intimacy that ignited the room in unseen ways. </p><p>When he looked back at them, Vidal was feeding Harkness with more care than a chef had for a delicate dish– holding the spoon as though it were a sacred task, a ritual of deep connection. </p><p>“Is she feeding her like she’s starving?” William murmured to Ireland when he reappeared at the hostess stand, the unease still evident on his face. </p><p>Ireland’s sigh was practically a groan, frustration mixing with a deep sense of knowing, “You’re an idiot, William. She’s pregnant. She’s carrying a piece of Vidal, and that little piece is probably going to be a terror like its parents.” She shot him a pointed look. “Pregnancy isn’t just about food, it’s about patience. Support. Love. Vidal’s doing the best she can to make sure her wife is comfortable. She’s not some ice queen, no matter how much she acts like one, no matter how terrifying she is. Now stop asking questions and do your damn job.” </p><p>William’s frown deepened, but he couldn’t help glancing over once again, watching the silent conversation unfold between the two women, even after he served their dinner, in which the Dean was still feeding more of the food to her wife. Her touch was constant, soft yet firm, as Harkness relished in the pliable connection between them. There wasn’t the normal armour, the normal walls that seemed to hold her above everyone else. No, here the pair were as equals, sharing soft laughs, smiling at each other, and speaking a language only they knew.</p><p> </p><p>He set down their dessert, the crème brûlée glistening under the soft light. As he retreated, the tension between them thickened again, the love, the devotion too palpable to ignore. Harkness’ eyes, locked on her wife, held a hunger that was not for the crème brûlée, and William felt a strange, involuntary shiver. </p><p>“Here’s your dessert,” he murmured, his throat tight, not quite meeting their eyes. </p><p>He could feel it– the awareness, the bond– trickling into him, even if he didn’t fully understand it. It made his skin prickle, a deep ache spreading through him, as if something had been set into motion that he couldn’t name. He retreated quickly, his mind a whirlpool of confusion as he waited for them to finish. </p><p> </p><p>They had set the dessert aside minutes ago, yet neither moved, leaning close and laughing softly. And just as William went to approach, something indeed did change. He stood there awkwardly, his arms at his sides as he watched as Harkness cupped Vidal by her cheeks, pulling her in for a kiss. This time, she wasn’t sweet or tender, it was desperate, deep, and fuck– <em> I’m gonna puke. </em></p><p>Yet, William couldn’t move, his eyes locked on the professors as Vidal grabbed at Harkness’ wrists, pulling her somehow closer as he heard himself gag as he swore he caught a motion of tongue. He snapped out of it, backing away from the scene, having felt he just walked in on his parents doing the deed, yet somehow this was worse. These were his two horrifying professors, making out in the middle of the restaurant. </p><p>“Nope, nope, nope,” he said to himself as he made his way back to Ireland. “I’ll buy you Chappel Roan tickets if you go hand them the bill.” </p><p>Ireland blinked at him, shaking her head exasperated, “What? Why?”</p><p>“They’re sucking faces.” </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio was in trouble—deep, delicious, inescapable trouble. She had spent the entire evening teasing her wife, testing the limits of Agatha’s patience with lingering touches—her fingers brushing over warm thighs, the ghost of her arm grazing sensitive breasts, the deliberate drag of her foot along a shapely calf. A glance, a smirk, a whispered promise in Spanish against the shell of Agatha’s ear, each one a spark in a steadily growing fire. The restaurant was new, a place she knew Agatha had been eyeing, despite her wife’s stubborn refusal to admit she was a romantic. So, Rio had made the reservations, knowing full well where the night would end– in tangled sheets, in breathless moans, in the kind of intimacy that left her trembling. But she had pushed too far, poked and prodded the bear one too many times. </p><p>The moment Agatha had yanked her into a searing kiss right in the middle of the restaurant, Rio had known exactly how the night would unfold. And the thought of pregnant Agatha taking control, pressing her down, leaving no room for escape? It had her mouth dry, her pulse frantic, her boxers soaked before they even reached the car. A wiser woman would have eased back at the final warning in Agatha’s eyes. But Rio– despite holding a PhD– was, at times, a fool. A fool who let her hand rest on her wife’s inner thigh during the drive home, tracing slow, deliberate circles, inching the fabric of Agatha’s dress higher and higher, daring fate itself. </p><p>Now, she was paying the price. </p><p>Her back slammed against the front door, the wood rattling, the glass panels threatening to crack under the force. She barely registered the sharp bite of pain, too lost in the sensation of Agatha’s mouth consuming hers, of a tongue curling deep, tasting her, claiming her. She moaned into the kiss, a sound swallowed whole as Agatha pressed closer, as skilled hands found their way under her blazer, cupping, kneading, setting every nerve ending alight. She was going to die tonight. And she prayed– desperately, reverently– that it would be with her wife straddling her face, thighs clenched tight, her nose rubbing into her wife’s clit as her wife rode her into oblivion. </p><p>She hummed into her wife’s taste, fingers scratching into her scalp as another hand moved up cup her breast through her blazer. Her whole body was on fire as her mind turned to mush. Agatha pushed her harder against the door, pressing, taking the air between was thick– charged electric, humming with something primal and for a moment Rio was transported back to their honeymoon where they barely even explored Greece, staying in their luxury beachside condo, fucking hard with the sound of the ocean providing a contrast rhythm to their harmony. </p><p>Rio barely had a second to breathe before her wife’s teeth found her jaw, then her throat, and finally that pulse point between her neck and shoulder that always made her moan. </p><p>Her knees nearly buckled as she gasped, “<em> Cariño.” </em></p><p>The word was swallowed by a sharp nip to her collarbone, a warning wrapped in her wife’s fire. </p><p>“Not so cocky now, are we?” Agatha’s voice was low, sultry, but laced with amusement and something so dark, Rio knew she was ruining her pants as well. “Thought you could keep teasing me all night without consequences?” </p><p>Rio’s mouth opened– maybe to apologize, maybe to provoke her further– but Agatha was faster. Her hands raked down Rio’s sides before a hand cupped her core, pressing into her as she felt her thighs start to grow slick with her own wetness. </p><p>“Fuck,” she breathed, her head thudding against the door. </p><p>Agatha smirked, fingers slipping under the waistband of Rio’s slacks, dragging her nails just above the soaked fabric of her boxers. </p><p>“That’s what you wanted, isn’t it?” her fingers curled, just barely grazing. “To push me until I snapped?” </p><p>Rio’s breath hitched, her hands finding purchase on Agatha’s waist, holding on as if she was the only thing tethering her to this world. And maybe she was. </p><p>“<em> Querida… </em>” she rasped, voice wrecked, desperate. “Please.” </p><p>Agatha hummed, considering. And then, with agonizing patience, she pulled away. Rio nearly whined at the loss. </p><p>“Bedroom,” Agatha commanded, stepping back, crossing her arms as she arched a brow. Her stance was nothing short of lethal. “Now.” </p><p>For a second, Rio hesitated– not in defiance, but in sheer awe. Her wife’s cheeks were flushed, her stomach round with the life they created eighteen weeks ago– and fuck Rio felt herself clench around nothing, staring at her fuller breasts and her round stomach. She looked almost like Gaia– she looked like life– she looked like she belonged to her. Rio felt a smirk come to creep in, but she swallowed, knowing her wife would perceive it as a challenge and maybe it was. With one final once over, Rio bolted through the livingroom and down the hall to their room.</p><p>The bedroom door had barely swung shut before Rio dropped to her knees, helping her wife out of her shoes before anything started. She had already kicked off her own along with tossing her jacket somewhere. When she looked up, she saw a soft gaze from her wife, before she was motioned closer to bed, but Rio remained on her knees. She didn’t need to be told where to be tonight. She just knew. Her wife stepped closer, not close enough for Rio’s liking as her arm stretched out, caressing creamy thighs, pressing into the curve of her hips as she gazed up again, breathless. Agatha stood before her, flushed but powerful, the dim light of the room painting her in hues of gold and shadow. The swell of her belly only made her seem more divine, more cosmic– like she was untouchable… except… she was touchable. She was Rio’s and Rio was hers. And currently, the way she was looking down at her, sent a shiver racing up her spine. </p><p>“You look so pretty like this,” Agatha mused, her voice thick as fingers trailed in Rio’s dark hair, pulling just enough to tilt her back. “All that teasing, all that smugness– where did it go, my love?” </p><p>Rio’s breath hitched as Agatha’s fingers curled tighter, nails scraping against her scalp. She swallowed, heat pooling low in her stomach, her hands tightening against Agatha’s thighs. </p><p>“Never left,” Rio managed, her voice wrecked and breathy, but her grin was still there, teasing, pleading. “I just–”</p><p>A sharp tug, sent her into total silence, making her wife’s smirk deepen as she murmured, “Good girl.” </p><p>She went to open her mouth again but froze as her wife let go of her hair. Her eyes trained on her hips as her wife lifted her dress to her waist. Agatha stepped forward until Rio’s mouth was right before her covered pussy. Rio didn’t need to be asked a single thing, in fact her body acted faster than her brain as she blinked and her lips were already planting longing kisses on her wife’s clit. She sucked lightly through the wet silk as fingers came into her hair again, caressing her head as Agatha’s breaths grew ragged. </p><p>Rio hummed against the damp fabric, savoring the way her wife’s breath hitched, the way her fingers curled tighter in her hair. She nuzzled further against her heat, tasting her through her underwear, but the tang of silk made it less satisfying compared to directly from the source. She slow, tentative, pressing open-mouthed kisses, while her tongue flicked against the sodden fabric, teasing. Above her, Agatha exhaled sharply, her body tensing for the briefest of moments and releasing a soft hum.</p><p>“So eager,” she hummed, gazing down at Rio. </p><p>Rio met the gaze, sucking more at the silk, trying to draw more of her rich tang. Nails dragged down the back of Rio’s neck and she took it as a sign, pressing her tongue more firmly, her kisses longer, and her tongue flicking faster as she alternated.</p><p>“I barely had to say a word, and you’re already worshiping me like a good little wife.” </p><p>Rio whimpered at the praise, her hands sliding up to grip Agatha’s thighs, holding her closer, <em> needing </em> her closer. </p><p>“I <em> am </em> a good wife,” she murmured, her lips brushing against sensitive skin, her tongue pressing against the soaked fabric just enough to make Agatha gasp. “I just love taking care of you, <em> mi amor </em>.” </p><p>Agatha chuckled, breathless, fingers tightening, “Mm, you say that, but you spent all night misbehaving.” </p><p>She exhaled sharply as Rio nipped lightly at her inner thigh, hands stroking up her hips. </p><p>“What am I supposed to do with you, hm?” </p><p>Rio grinned against her skin, pressing another kiss, softer this time, slow and reverent. </p><p>“Let me make it up to you,” she whispered, her voice rough with need. </p><p>Agatha hummed, as if considering, though the slight roll of her hips against Rio’s mouth told her she already had her answer. She smirked, sticking her tongue out and curling up hard against her. Her wife bucked before a hand was fisting in her hair again, pulling her away and making Rio pout. </p><p>“Strip and lay down on the bed,” Agatha’s command was firm and went straight to Rio’s core. </p><p>Rio scrambled up, already unhooking her bra as her wife tilted her head, watching with dark blue eyes. She shimmied out her pants with less grace than she would have liked, but a feeling her wife wouldn’t be as patient as she usually was. The moment she was bare before her wife, she backed towards the bed, crawling back until she laid in the center, her elbows propping her up as her gaze refused to leave her wife’s. She was watched as with deliberate slowness, her wife unzipped her dress, allowing it to fall to the floor. She had bought the dress for her the other day for their dinner, with every intention herself to be the one unzipping it, but for her now she couldn’t find it within herself to complain as the velvet dress thumped to the floor, leaving her pregnant wife in just her underwear. They were lilac, but her center was now a deep purple– soaked with her arousal and Rio’s own saliva.</p><p>Thumbs hooked around the sides before in one fluid motion they dropped. Her wife stalked towards her, a single hand cradling underneath her the swell of her belly and fuck, Rio could barely concentrate. She swore in her head, swallowing hard as she fought everything in her body from coming at the sight of her pregnant naked wife alone. Agatha would gloat for days and definitely use it to her advantage. Her wife climbed on the mattress but instead of climbing up Rio’s body with her thighs on either side of her head, her wife paused, a darker glint shining in her eyes. Rio’s legs were spread, her wife maneuvering her own body where one leg was shoved under hers, and the other was thrown over her other. She reached forward, guiding her wife’s hips as their cores kissed, soaked lips pressed against each other before they moved in perfect sync.</p><p>A wet chorus filled the room as their pussies squelched against one another's. They both were panting hard, each press of her wife’s hips against hers, sending pleasure through her whole body. She chased the high, before her wife adjusted them, her clit hitting her wife’s center just right. Agatha was moaning loudly, adding the wet chorus of fucking as something in Rio’s lower stomach was growing taunt. She loved when they did this, feeling so connected, so close and sometimes it was more overwhelming than having her fingers inside her or her mouth on her wife.</p><p>“Fuck, oh baby you feel so good,” her wife moaned. “Such a good girl– letting me use her pussy– fuck, fuck.” </p><p>Lighting struck through Rio as she made the mistake– well it wasn’t a mistake, but it was about to make her lose her dignity– of opening up her eyes. She stared down at her wife through hooded eyes. A sheen of sweat covered her, making her skin glow as their hips moved, but Gods, Rio’s eyes trained on her wife’s stomach– from the swell, to the stretch marks, to how big her breasts were– there were no words to describe the beauty she was staring at– no sonnet, no poem, not even a Hozier song could describe that absolute etherealness of her wife. The coil in her stomach tightened, but fuck, she didn’t know how she didn’t come the moment blue met brown. </p><p>“Fuck, Rio– I’m–I’m close,” her wife moaned out. </p><p>“Yes, <em> mi amor, </em>come with me,” Rio husked out, grinding her hips harder into her wife, feeling the white hot pleasure hitting her clit with every roll. </p><p>Agatha moaned louder, before her voice rang out,“Come– come inside me! Come inside me! Fuck, please!” </p><p>Rio saw white, the coil releasing her body went rigid and stilled as her back arched. Her wife’s name left her lips, her words echoing in her head as she felt liquid spray against her, her wife coming right after her. She reached down blindly, finding her wife’s hand and interlacing their fingers as they both laid there for a moment, both of them coming down from their high. She gave her wife’s hand a gentle squeeze, a silent way to check in with her. Her wife squeezed back and she fully relaxed, knowing her wife was okay. She blinked through her hooded eyes when suddenly her wife moved, causing Rio to snap her head up. She watched as her wife moved over, crawling over her body until her thighs were hugging hips. </p><p>Agatha leaned down, capturing Rio’s lips in a sweet and tender kiss, her stomach just touching Rio’s despite the space they were keeping. Her wife kissed her until the ache grew back between her legs. She lifted her hips up, seeking any type of friction, but her wife pulled away, smirking down at her. Agatha sat up, her thighs shuffling forward until Rio’s hands came, helping situate herself where a thigh rested on either side of her head. Her tongue came out, eager and ready to taste her, but her wife didn’t budge, just hovering over Rio’s mouth. </p><p>“Mm, such a lucky girl– getting to taste herself inside me,” her wife rasped, her fingers running through raven locks. “Are you lucky?” </p><p>Rio nodded up at her, every single thought leaving her brain before the fingers tightened, tugging harshly on her hair again. </p><p>She quickly corrected herself, meeting blues, “Yes, <em> mi amor.”  </em></p><p>Her wife let go of her hair, her hips slowly lowering down onto Rio’s face. Her arms came up, wrapping around her wife’s thighs as moans rang out louder into the room. She guided her hips, focusing on how to bring out the right reaction from her wife. Her tongue swirl, flicked, and pushed inside, before drawing back, sucking her clit into her mouth. The taste was strong and each flick inside her wife made her wonder if she did accomplish coming inside her. Their flavor together was sweeter, stronger, and oh so perfect. Rio licked with new fever, her tongue quick and precise as her head bobbed slightly. The thighs around her head muffled the moans from Agatha as her hips started a slow, deep rhythm. </p><p>Rio opened her eyes, barely even able to see her wife’s face from her stomach. She smirked, making her tongue flat against her before sucking her clit into her mouth, swallowing everything she could. The hand fisting hair left, her wife’s arms stretching out to grasp the headboard as her hips moved faster, grinding harder down on her wife. Rio took deep breaths when she could, inhaling the musky scent of her wife that only had her mouth work hard, her tongue faster as she licked, sucked, and kissed. Her wife shifted her hips above her, this time, Rio’s mouth was fully enveloped by her lover’s lips, warm liquid gushing into her mouth as Agatha fucked herself faster on Rio’s face. </p><p>“Yes, yes, just like that– right there,” she heard the muffled moan and doubled down. </p><p>Thighs tightened around her head as her wife was between pressing down harder on her and pulling away. Rio’s grip tightened, pulling her full weight into her face as her teeth nicked her clit, sending a jolt through her wife. The grinding became frantic, her face slightly moving with the rough movement until she knew exactly what to do to push her wife over the edge. Wrapping her lips around her clit, she sucked hard and her wife screamed her orgasm. Her hands came up to her waist, holding her wife in place, slowly guiding her wife through it as her mouth, nose, and chin were thoroughly soaked. Agatha came hard, shaking above her and to Rio’s surprise, the orgasm was longer than usual. She kept guiding her, eagerly lapping as her wife’s cunt as a gush of hot liquid dripped down her cheeks and down her neck. Rio smirked, swallowing it all as her hips slowly came to a stop. She secretly loved Agatha like this– so sensitive, and the further she went along in pregnancy, the easier she was to squirt. She took every delight in it, even though she liked the usual challenge, but this was too divine. </p><p>Rio kissed her wife’s thighs softly as they quivered. She watched as a hand came down, rubbing her belly and she wondered if their son was moving. Rio placed a hand over her wife’s, keeping her kisses soft and her tongue light as she cleaned up the mess. The moment her wife shifted, she was there, helping her shift down until Agatha was straddling her waist. She melted as hands caressed her cheeks, wiping away the sheen of Agatha’s cum off her cheeks and chin. Then, she was leaning down their lips locking passionately. Rio smiled into it, her wife’s tongue exploring her mouth and tasting herself from Rio’s own tongue.</p><p>As fast as it started, it ended, Rio pouting as her wife sat up and got off of her. Rio sat up, watching her wife opening their drawer and pulling out a purple harkness and a matching purple dildo. Rio’s eyes widened watching her wife push the dildo through the ‘O’ ring before pulling it up her left thigh and her mouth watered. She gasped as Agatha tugged her towards the edge of the bed, spreading her legs, and pressing the purple silicone up against her. She moaned, her wife moving her thigh before adjusting the harness better against her. </p><p>“Agatha–” </p><p>Her wife’s lip curled but she was firmly cut off as her wife shifted her thigh forward. She gasped, feeling herself stretch around it. Her eyes closed, her neck stretching back as the curve pressed into that perfect spot inside her. In truth, it had been a good four months since she’s taken the strap. Ever since they find out her wife was expecting, Rio has been the one on the giving end, spoiling her wife, but there is that certain fire in her wife’s eyes, a fire that wanted to burn Rio from inside out until she was nothing but a shaking, quivering mess– a fire that wanted to ruin her. And fuck, Rio gladly brought the gasoline. </p><p>She smirked up at her wife, giving her a show as her legs spread wider, her body arching up into her. She chuckled darkly as she started a deep pace, feeling each delicious stretch of her wife inside her. Agatha raised an eyebrow, daring her to speak, and once more Rio was a happy fool. </p><p>“Wouldn’t you prefer,” she purred, drawing out her words, trying to ignore the moans wanting to rise from her throat as her wife purposely pushed harder into her “to take me from behind, <em> mi amor?”  </em></p><p>Rio expected the snark, prepared herself for the “Oh, and you would like that, wouldn’t you?”  But it didn’t come. Instead, her wife snarled and pulled abruptly out of Rio making her whine at the loss. Hands were on hips, flipping her roughly on her stomach, before her hips were lifted again, a pillow being placed underneath her. She smiled fondly, but the smile quickly melted into one of pure pleasure as her wife slammed the dildo back inside her. She fisted the sheets, her body dripping in sweat, feeling each drag of her wife’s cock scraping against her walls. Rio met the pace, her ass slapping back against Agatha’s thigh. Hands groped her ass before nails were running up and down her back, tracing the tattoo. Rio moaned, the coil starting to build again as her body was flying. Everything within her soared as she moved her hips faster, wanting, needing more as her wife used her thigh to fuck her. It was deliriously hot, her pregnant wife wearing a thigh strap, her hands mapping out her tattoo as Rio fell compliant and took it. </p><p>“<em> ¡Coño! Por favor, mi amor. Sí, ahí mismo,” </em>she cried out, her head falling into the sheets to muffle her cries. </p><p>She moaned out when a hand was back in her hair, lifting her face from the sheets as her wife’s thigh worked against her. Her breathing became ragged, drool dripping off from her lips as she felt her gaze grow hazy, but something caught her vision, the reason why her wife was lifting her head. She stared straight into their long mirror in the corner of the room, realizing it was angling on them perfectly. Her eyes were blown and hooded, her mouth hung open as her face was red and contorted into an expression of pure bliss. Behind her, her wife stood moving her leg against her with a certain concentration, but then those blues met hers and Rio was gone. The coil in her lower stomach snapped hard, spidering out through her body like an electric current. Rio’s eyes rolled to the back of her head, white encompassing her vision as a silent scream left her lips. </p><p>She breathed heavily, trying her best to calm down when a hand was brushing the hair back from her face. She opened her eyes, meeting concerned blues staring down at her. She didn’t even realize her wife flipped her on her back, nor when she pulled out, nor her taking off the thigh strap. She smiled up lazily at her, tilting her head as her wife only chuckled at her expression as the hand came down to cup her cheek. </p><p>“You alright, my love? It’s been a while since you took my strap,” her wife spoke softly. </p><p>She hummed her laughter, melting into her touch as she closed her eyes for a moment, “Yeah.” </p><p>Rio remained silent for a beat longer, basking in her wife’s affection before speaking again, “I forgot we had that harness.” </p><p>Her wife laughed, “Mm, figured it would be easier than a regular harness.” </p><p>She nodded, a subtle shift in her gaze that spoke volumes, her fingers rising toward her lips, a quiet invitation. Agatha, always attuned to her, caught the message in an instant. Without a word, she leaned in, her lips brushing softly against Rio’s. The kiss began slowly and tenderly, a languid press that seemed to hold the weight of everything unspoken. It lingered, stretching into something deeper than either had anticipated, a comfort, a need, both finding solace in the quiet press of skin on skin. And then it grew, the connection evolving naturally, like a storm brewing on the horizon. Agatha’s arms drew Rio closer, their bodies pressed more firmly together, the kiss intensifying as Agatha’s tongue slipped into Rio’s mouth, moving in slow, deliberate strokes. Rio responded in kind, their tongues tangling with an ease born of years together, of shared breaths and shared moments. Agatha tasted the sweetness of Rio’s mouth, the warmth of her, and with a boldness that was entirely Agatha’s own, she traced the roof of Rio’s mouth with the tip of her tongue, a deep, searching gesture. </p><p>Rio groaned, the sound low and caught somewhere between pleasure and the overwhelming need to be closer. Her hand, as if of its own accord, rested on her wife’s belly, her touch gentle yet grounding, as though anchoring them in that moment. It wasn’t just the kiss– it was the shared rhythm, the unspoken communication that flowed effortlessly between them. Their mouths danced, tasted, explored in a way that transcended time and words, each kiss more fervent than the last. The sweet, familiar taste of Agatha filled Rio’s senses, her wife’s scent, the soft warmth of her skin, all enveloping her like a wave. It was perfect, the kind of perfection that comes from knowing someone so completely that even the smallest gesture could speak volumes. And then, in an unexpected burst of laughter, Rio yelped as Agatha pulled her upright, her hands finding their way to Rio’s face, cradling it as if she were memorizing every curve, every line. Rio’s heart fluttered, a mixture of love and awe, as they paused for a breath, eyes locked. </p><p>She watched as the smirk came back, “Think you got a few more rounds in you, tiger?” </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes fondly, pressing a kiss to the corner of her wife’s lips as she stood. She pulled out her own black harness, adjusting it around her hips before pulling out two dildos, offering them to her wife like they were something sacred. One was a dark forest green, its girth thicker and long and almost heavy in her hand. The other was a bluer shade of green, anatomically correct with ridges of veins, and a curve her wife loved. It was smaller, less intimidating than the other. Her wife took the smaller dildo in hand, Rio placing the other back in their drawer and turning for her wife to fit the dildo into the ring and adjusting her buckles again. Before she could move to lay on her bed, Agatha wrapped her hand around the dildo before reaching up and grabbing Rio by the cheeks with her thumb and fingers on either side. Rio knew the gesture, gathering her spit and placing it in her wife’s hand. </p><p>She groaned as Agatha coated the strap in her own saliva, pumping her hand around the shaft before moving her hand to the base, making sure it rubbed against Rio’s clit. Her hips bucked involuntarily as a throaty moan left her. Her wife smirked, taking the head into her mouth and fuck, the sight of her wife hollowing out her cheeks around her cock made her dizzy. Blues met hers as her wife somehow gave her a look of innocence, batting her eyelashes up at her as the blues shined. She tangled her hand in her wife’s thick waves, pulling her closer on instinct. Her wife took her gagging slightly around her cock, the vibrations of it went straight to her clit and she moaned, her head thrown back as her wife continued to deep throat her before pulling abruptly away, releasing her cock. </p><p>Rio looked back down, staring at the wanton expression, large, blown out pupils swallowing the blue, swollen lips, and a string of spit about break that connected from Agatha’s lips to her cock. She cupped her cheek, pressing a quick and nasty kiss to her lips, taking her spit for herself in a greedy, possessive manner before lying back in bed. She took her wife’s hand, guiding her to straddle over her before easing her cock inside her. They both moaned as Rio swore she could feel her wife squeezing around her as she lowered her until Rio was fully inside her. Neither moved as Agatha’s eyes remained closed, taking in the sensation. </p><p>Rio watched her, stomach round, breasts large– Rio lunged, tired of holding back. She had always loved her boobs and even more so now as they grew. She wasn’t sure when would be the last time she could do this for a long time until they started producing milk for their son, and fuck, Rio wasn’t going to let the chance pass her. Her lips wrapped around an enlarged nipple, sucking it right into her mouth as her wife moaned loudly, a hand on the back of her head to keep her there. </p><p>Her wife laughed through her moan, “Was wondering how long you were able to hold back.” </p><p>Rio let out an indigent grunt, never leaving from her task of pressing soft kisses after harsh sucks and her tongue flicking at a hardened bud. She smiled to herself, happily leaving dark bruises into her breasts before switching to the other, giving it the same attention.  </p><p>Agatha held in there as Rio tasted her skin, her mouth wrapping around as much as she could before pulling away and muttering, “I swear they are getting bigger by the day.”</p><p>Her wife laughed at her again, pulled her mouth back to her nipple, “Mmm, and they are just going to keep growing.”  </p><p>She groaned, sucking harder, “Gods, you’re so fucking beautiful.” </p><p>Rio didn’t need to see the smile to know it was there as she lavished her wife’s breasts. She sucked, kissed, and licked, leaving her marks of possession until her wife pushed her away, pinning her into the sheets. She grunted into them, her hand resting on her wife’s hips, guiding her rhythm as the part inside the harness dug perfectly into her clit. The pleasure was lazily perfect until her wife wanted more. She was tempted to flip them over, pin Agatha into their bed and fuck her until her wife knew nothing but Rio’s name, but with her growing stomach, she couldn’t have her on her back for long. </p><p>Rio’s hips lifted up, meeting her wife’s each thrust as she bounced in Rio’s lap, her breasts moving with her as she moaned, but their eyes remained locked on each other. It didn’t take long for Rio, in fact it was embarrassingly quick as the coil grew and snapped, and she came hard, moaning her wife’s name. She didn’t slow, her hips grinding up as her wife hummed through her pleasure. </p><p>“Gods,” she chuckled. “If your cock was real, I would have been pregnant a long time ago.” </p><p>Rio furrowed her eyebrows, a pout on her lips, “I would be able to pull out, <em> cariño.” </em></p><p>This made her wife laugh more, “No, no you wouldn’t, my love. Your pull out game would be weak.”</p><p>She blinked, staring up at her wife with actual shock, but it transformed into a different type of shock as her wife continued. </p><p>“Plus, I don’t think I would let you pull out,” her wife shrugged, as if it was just a casual admission, not something that took the breath out of Rio.</p><p>Rio pulled her harder against her, getting a gasp from her wife as she drilled her hips harder into her wife. Agatha’s eyes snapped close as her mouth opened, her moans mixing in with the wet furious sound of skin against skin. Agatha came quickly, bottoming out hard as she moaned, but her thrusts didn’t stop, no the fire was still there, telling Rio she needed more. She flipped to the side, pulling out of her wife who whined at the loss, but complied as Rio directed her to face away from her. She angled their bodies, lining up the strap as she morphed herself against her wife’s back. </p><p>Sweat covered them, their bodies sliding together with ease, as Rio nosed the damp baby hairs away from her wife’s eyes, kissing her cheek as she started a simple rhythm. Agatha wrapped her arm behind her, her hand cupping the back of Rio’s head as she pressed open mouth kisses to her neck and collarbone. Her free hand snaked down her lover’s body, rubbing over her stomach before dipping lower and between her legs. Her wife released a choked moan as her fingers gathered her wife’s cum and arousal before her fingers scissored around her cock that thrusted inside her. Pressing her wife’s lips harder around her cock, Agatha gasped and whined. </p><p>“Fuck– fuck, Rio, yes! Like that!”</p><p>She continued the movement, rubbing her hand up and down as her hips never wavered, they only grew faster, pounding into her wife as she sucked at her wife’s shoulder, unable to help herself, but knowing to avoid her neck. Agatha squirmed, moaned, and gasped, panting beside her as the coil in Rio’s stomach came back stronger. </p><p>“Are you close, <em> mi vida </em>?” she husked into her ear. </p><p>Her wife nodded frantically, unable to produce words. </p><p>“Don’t come yet. I want you to come with me,” she nosed just under hear ear. “<em> Lo estás haciendo muy bien, me estás llevando muy bien, mi buena niña </em> . <em> Te sientes tan bien. Dioses, si pudiera, te llenaría, me correría dentro de ti.” (</em>You’re doing so well, you’re taking me so well, my good girl. You feel so good. Gods, if I could, I would fill you up, I would cum inside you.)</p><p>Agatha gasped, as Rio smirked, her fingers moving to circle her clit, “<em> Estás cerca ¿no? Anda, corre para mí.” (</em>You're close, aren't you? Go on, come for me)</p><p>Her wife came with a loud cry into the still house, Rio following with her as she kissed her neck, helping them both ride it out. She could feel her wife squeezing hard around the dildo, clenching and trying to push it out as the sheets became soaked in more than just sweat. Rio held her close, her hands on her stomach as she began her usual routine of caring for her wife, knowing she was spent. </p><p>“<em> Eso es todo, mi amor. Lo hiciste muy bien, muy bien. Estás bien. Te tengo. </em>” (That’s it, my love. You did very well, so good. You’re okay. I got you.”)</p><p>She held her wife until she went still, a smile plastered on her face as blue eyes remained closed. Rio waited for both of their breaths to even out before placing a hand on her wife’s hip, a silent tell that she was pulling out. Her wife gasped at the overstimulation before her body melted back into the bed. Rio gazed at her wife, a smile tugging at the corners of her lips as she took in the sight of her– completely undone, yet stunning in the aftermath. Her hair was a wild mess, tangles woven like memories across the sheets. The marks of their love adorned her body, hickies on her breasts and shoulders that would surely get Rio an earful later about it. Her lips were swollen, her cheeks and chest flushed, a soft pink glow to her skin that spoke of their shared passion. She was a masterpiece, a work of art, and Rio was captivated. </p><p>Leaning down, Rio pressed a gentle kiss to her wife’s cheek, a tender moment amid the chaos of their desire. A smile tugged on Agatha’s lips but she remained where she was as Rio stood, unbuckling the harness and grabbing her wife’s from the floor. In the bathroom, she cleaned their straps, the quiet movements laced with intimacy, before taking a soft towel, soaking it in warm water, and returning to her love. Back in their bedroom, her wife lay sprawled out, her hand resting on her stomach, utterly spent yet serene. Rio felt a surge of affection as she worked, her fingers brushing against her wife’s skin as she wiped away the evidence of their shared pleasure. She paused as she noticed the slight twitch in her wife’s body, a soft sigh escaping her lips as she continued her gentle ministrations. </p><p>With each delicate motion, Rio took her time, savoring the quiet intimacy of caring for her wife. Her hands moved with reverence as she dried her wife’s legs, her arms, her chest– every inch of her body was treated like the most precious thing in the world. It wasn’t just the act of cleaning her, but the love woven into every gesture. She could feel it in the air between them, in the soft silence of the room, where words weren’t needed. The bond they shared, raw and beautiful, pulsed with every touch. Rio wasn’t merely wiping away the remnants of their love; she was cherishing it, embracing it, soaking in the quiet strength of their connection. </p><p>Her gaze shifted downward, drawn to the way her wife cradled her stomach, protectively holding their child close. The sight of it– a perfect, round symbol of their future together– stirred something deep inside Rio. Her heart swelled with a fierce tenderness as she leaned down and pressed a gentle kiss to her wife’s belly, feeling an unspoken bond with the life growing inside. She caressed her wife’s cheek, brushing away a strand of hair, and when Agatha’s eyes fluttered open, Rio’s heart skipped a beat. She smiled softly, loving the way the drowsiness clung to her wife, the exhaustion from their love mingling with something deeper, something eternal. </p><p>“Can you stand up for me, <em> cariño </em>? I need to change our sheets,” Rio asked, her voice soft but insistent, a note of playfulness creeping in. </p><p>Agatha’s response was a simple shake of her head, her eyes closing again with a huff of resistance. Rio couldn’t help but roll her eyes affectionately, her lips curving upward at the familiar sight of her wife’s stubbornness. She wouldn’t let her rest just yet, not when there was work to be done. With ease, Rio reached forward, her arms wrapping gently but securely around her wife. One hand slipped under her knees, the other supporting her back, and she lifted her effortlessly. Agatha leaned into her, a smile ghosting across her lips as she peppered kisses to Rio’s neck. The closeness, the warmth, the familiarity of it all wrapped around Rio’s heart like a warm embrace. </p><p>For a moment, there was a gentle struggle– Agatha’s body clinging to hers, reluctant to move, but Rio was determined. She maneuvered her wife slowly, carefully, until she had enough blankets to work as sheets before more to cover them. The soft weight of the fabric felt comforting, a cocoon of warmth and love. Once Agatha was settled, Rio kissed her temple, her lips lingering for a moment as she gazed down at her wife. Her round belly, resting gently atop Rio’s own stomach, created a perfect picture of serenity and love. It was in these quiet, tender moments, with their world reduced to the simple intimacy of being together, that Rio felt the depth of her connection with Agatha. There were no words needed; the way their hearts beat in tandem, the way their bodies fit so perfectly together, spoke more than any promises ever could. </p><p>Just as she was drifting asleep, she felt her wife shift, “I love you.” </p><p>She smiled, kissing the top of her head, “<em> Te amo, cariño. </em>” </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The living room buzzed with warmth, alive with music and laughter, bodies swaying and shifting in front of her like flickering candle flames. The scent of cinnamon, pine, and cider wrapped around her, rich and heady, nearly overwhelming. She wrinkled her nose, exhaling slowly in an attempt to settle her stomach. Her hand drifted over the curve of her belly in slow, reverent circles, as if to soothe the restless energy stirring beneath her skin. The sensation had been constant lately– a ceaseless fluttering, delicate yet insistent, like feathers dusting against the inside of her womb. She shifted slightly, trying to ease the odd swirling sensation, already suspecting that their child was bound to be restless. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Of course</span>
</em>
<span>, she thought wryly. </span>
<em>
<span>Just like their Mami</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A soft laugh pulled her from her thoughts, wrapping around her like the first twinkle of evening stars, as sweet as a mourning dove’s call, as gentle as water trickling over smooth stone. Before she could stop herself, she was already smiling, drawn instinctively toward the source. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>By the tree, her wife stood with easy grace, her dark curls catching the glow of the twinkling lights. Brown eyes, warm and bright, sparkled as her shoulders shook with laughter. She dipped her head, a rare flush creeping up her sharp cheekbones as Alice nudged her, teasing her about something Agatha couldn’t quite catch. Agatha’s heart swelled at the sight. As if sensing her gaze, Rio’s laughter softened, her eyes flickering toward Agatha as if she’d known all along she was watching. She watched as her wife drew back to her friend, Alice playfully hitting her before a presence loomed over, a mug of hot tea in hand being set slowly on the glass coffee table in front of her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ximena sat down beside her, a soft smile on her face, “</span>
<em>
<span>¿Te sientes bien, mi niña?” </span>
</em>
<span>(You feeling okay, my girl?) </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, her hand drawing more circles across her belly, “</span>
<em>
<span>Sí, simplemente se están moviendo mucho esta noche.” </span>
</em>
<span>(Yes, they are just moving a lot tonight.) </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>beamed, a frail hand placed beside hers, </span>
<em>
<span>“Está recogiendo la energía de Yule.” </span>
</em>
<span>(He is picking up the energy of Yule.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>A loud cackle from her wife snapped both of their heads over to Rio who wore a dark glint in her eyes as Oriana playfully smacked her. Ximena sighed knowingly, standing and sauntering off somewhere in the house, but Agatha’s eyebrows raised, watching the scene that was slowly folding out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia had sidled up beside Oriana, a smirk playing at her lips,“Well, at least you didn’t live with one of them when they were together in college. I have become </span>
<em>
<span>immune</span>
</em>
<span> to the sounds they make.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Oriana groaned dramatically, burying her face in her hands. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh</span>
</em>
<span>, Agatha nearly laughed. </span>
<em>
<span>So that’s what this was about.</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>They were teasing Oriana over what she and </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita</span>
</em>
<span> had overheard the morning before they were forced to all go shopping. Predictably, Rio did not let up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How else do you think my wife got pregnant, Ori?” Rio drawled, her voice thick with mockery, stretching her sister’s name like a cat playing with its prey. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Oriana shot her a glare, her hands still partially covering her face, “You do </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> have a dick, Rio!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha saw it before it even happened– the shift in Rio’s expression, the slow curl of her smirk into something dangerous. That was the look of a woman about to make everything worse for the sheer pleasure of it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah?” Rio tilted her head, eyes gleaming. “And how would </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Oriana’s glare sharpened, an unspoken death threat passing between them as their friends erupted in laughter. Rio, ever the menace, flicked her hair back and pushed her tongue against her cheek, feigning nonchalance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you must know, my dick is </span>
<em>
<span>very</span>
</em>
<span> real when it needs to be,” Rio mused, the corner of her mouth curving upward. “And trust me, it’s long enough that my </span>
<em>
<span>wife</span>
</em>
<span> isn’t complaining.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Laughter erupted, loud and raucous, as Oriana let out a strangled groan, slapping both hands over her face as if she could block out the sheer audacity radiating from her little sister. Lilia wheezed, clapping a hand on Oriana’s shoulder for support, while Alice nearly doubled over, struggling to catch her breath. Agatha exhaled a slow breath, shaking her head fondly as she smoothed a hand over her belly. Their child was particularly active tonight, rolling and fluttering beneath her palm like they, too, were amused by their </span>
<em>
<span>mami’s</span>
</em>
<span> antics. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But then came the sharp thwack of wood against skull. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s head snapped forward with a hiss, her hand flying to the back of it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Mierda</span>
</em>
<span>! What the hell?” she grumbled, turning with a dramatic wince. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ximena stood there, unimpressed, wooden spoon in hand like a weapon of divine justice. She didn’t need to say anything, the glare was enough to have Rio flinch, still rubbing the back of her head, but Agatha couldn’t help herself. She snorted, laughing loudly with the others, her hand on her belly as the swirling became more prominent with each intake of breath. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife’s gaze snapped to her, a wild look of betrayement before her lip curled, “Of course you think this is funny.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t respond, sitting up more, her laughter growing addictive as her wife crossed the room in a few strides. Rio crouched before her, her own hand resting on her stomach, easing the flutters in her stomach as her laughter finally calmed down. She hummed, scratching the back of her wife’s head in mock sympathy, but her wife didn’t swat her away. Instead, her hand rubbed in smooth circles before moving under Agatha’s shirt. Rio’s touch was cold compared to her hot body, fingers splayed on her skin finally the flutters started to ease as if sensing their </span>
<em>
<span>mami</span>
</em>
<span>’s presence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your child is restless tonight, my love,” she said softly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled softly, her thumb caressing the swell gently, “He is just excited, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor.</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes fondly, but jumped when a loud knock banged on their door. Her wife remained for a moment, soothing the sudden flutters that seemed to have jumped to life with her. Her eyebrows creased though, not understanding who could be here. Everyone was here that mattered, except for Hela and a few of Agatha’s own close friends from college. Pepper, Tony, and Jennifer were in the kitchen as far as she knew and everyone else was right in front of her. She swallowed hard as Rio stood, placing a quick kiss on her lips before heading towards the door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The only person who wasn’t here was… Maria. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Agatha could stop her wife, a loud familiar laugh rang through the house. She jumped, her heart leaping at the familiar sound before voices came from the hall. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You missed dinner, but we have left overs set aside,” her wife spoke as Agatha stood, albeit, slower than she would have liked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A cherry-like lilt responded, echoing down the foyer in the usual dramatic flair, “Not to worry, Rio. Sorry, Jarvis couldn’t make it, where is your wife?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Just as the words left his mouth, Agatha stepped into the hall and was greeted by the sight of her wife who was reluctantly embraced by a man with hair as dark as hers and a slightly crooked nose. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Kingo?” she gasped, making the man finally release her wife, who brushed off the hug like it personally wounded her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aggie!” he beamed, his voice a little too loud as she cringed at the old nickname. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She barely had time to react before Kingo enveloped her a warm hug, but for once the hug didn’t break her spine. “You are glowing.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She smiled softly, her wife giving her a knowing smile. Gods, she hasn’t seen Kingo in over five years, minus his Hollywood appearances and occasional texts. They were tight friends in college when she met him her junior year, not to mention, their wedding officiant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you doing here?” she couldn’t keep the shock out of her voice as Kingo let go, allowing her wife to slip past and stand beside her. “I thought you were imprisoned in Bollywood with the occasional transfer to Hollywood.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t bother to hide the smile as her wife wrapped her arm around her waist, a hand already on her stomach .</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kingo tilted his head, this time wearing a rare soft expression, “Well, I got a text from the missus that you two were expecting and, an invitation to Yule. But, I wanted to see for myself if it was true that the great Agatha Harkness got knocked up. Let me tell you, motherhood looks good on you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hiding her blush, she punched him hard in the shoulder, earning a scoff from him and slight snort from her wife. Her wife ushered them into the kitchen, getting Kingo a drink before Kingo and Tony were talking away. Agatha smiled softly, her hand still resting on her stomach. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Soft lips pressed against her cheek, getting her to greet tender brown eyes. Agatha reached up, cupping her wife’s cheeks as hands came to her wrists like a thousand times before. She lost herself in Rio’s eyes, seeing nothing but love and adoration. Her thumb moved up on her cheek, returning the same smile. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Before either could close the distance– </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey lovebirds! Get your asses in here!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grumbled, rolling her eyes, her hands falling from her wife’s face, but Rio didn’t let go. No, she yelped when when she was pulled closer, lips pressed against hers. She let herself fall into it, shrouding her in warmth as cold hands landed on her stomach again. Rio smiled into the kiss, pulling away for less than a second before lips were placed back on hers. Her own hand came back up, cupping her wife’s cheek and pulling her closer into the kiss before someone cleared their throat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They pulled away, a little reluctantly, facing off the great matriarch who held out both of her hands. The pair each took one, being led back into their living room where two chairs from their dining room were placed in the middle of the room in front of the TV and deliberately centered for those sitting on the couch and chairs to stare at. Both of them tensed at once, sharing a confused look with each other as their eyes spoke. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>What the fuck is this? </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow at Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife shook shoulders, her eyebrows creasing as if to say, </span>
<em>
<span>How would I know?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Ximena sat them in the chairs before taking her seat on the couch between Oriana and Lilia. Agatha eyed everyone like a hawk, noting each of their smug expressions but also noticing that Pepper, Tony, and Kingo were missing. Her wife seemed to catch on faster, sitting up rigidly as her voice lowered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What the fuck is this?” she echoed her wife’s question.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Unlike Agatha, who thrived on attention, Rio hated it– which was odd due to their professions, which Rio claimed was different minus the dread of faculty meetings and she guessed in recent light, the rumors… the rumors that would turn to gossip the moment they stepped back on campus. Agatha tried not thinking about it, but she internally cringed when she remembered their dinner two nights ago, realizing the waiter was one of their students. Hopefully, Wybie– or whatever the fuck was his name– was a gossiper and was already talking, that way the fire wouldn’t roar as hot when they made it back to campus. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Relájate, Río,</span>
</em>
<span>” Abuelita snapped, her voice sharp as she motioned for Rio to sit back down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio obeyed, though her posture remained stiff, her eyes flashing with annoyance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Careful, babe. One more step,” came Pepper’s voice from the basement stairs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha barely held back a groan, exchanging an exasperated glance with her wife. Both of them were equally irritated, especially with the sounds of Pepper and Tony dragging something heavy from the basement. Agatha’s stomach twisted in anticipation as she heard them struggling toward the living room. As if on cue, Pepper and Tony appeared, lugging a long, foldable table stacked high with mountains of brightly wrapped presents. They set the table down beside Rio before bolting out of the room with barely a word, leaving neither Rio nor Agatha a chance to question them. Rio straightened up, opening her mouth to speak, but </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita</span>
</em>
<span> silenced her with a single, authoritative glance. Rio huffed, frustrated, her eyes narrowing at the table. Agatha’s gaze followed her wife’s to the pile of presents, and they exchanged another silent conversation. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Please tell me this isn’t what I think this is,</span>
</em>
<span> Rio’s eyes begged, her irritation clear. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned, her head tilting toward the table, </span>
<em>
<span>Unfortunately, it might be. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I’m going to kill them.</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Agatha could speak again, Alice let out a dramatic sigh, crossing her arms with a raised brow, “Ugh, they’re doing that thing again.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What thing?” Oriana asked, looking up in confusion. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia’s voice came next, dripping with mild disdain, “The thing where they have full conversations with just their eyes.”</span>
<em>
<span> </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat up this time, ready to snap at them, but voices carried from their foyer again, accompanied by the sound of something rolling across hardwood floors until it fell silent on the carpet. Agatha felt her mouth hang open as she stared as Kingo pushed in a large box on a metal dolly. Tony and Pepper came in behind him as she scowled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you get dirt and snow on my carpet, Kingo–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Relax, sweetness, don’t let your hormones get you all agitated now,” he smirked at her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fists tightened, as her jaw clenched. Right, that’s why she hadn’t seen him in five years because he somehow got more under her skin than her wife ever could, and not in a good way. She went to stand, but a hand came down on her knee, holding her in place as Tony and Kingo pushed the box off the dolly, before wheeling it out of sight. Agatha turned back to the cardboard box. It was huge, easily taking up the space if there was another seat of the couch. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She swallowed hard, keeping in mind of Rio’s </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>sitting in front of them, “Okay, what is this? We agreed on no over the top gifts for Yule this year.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Every. Single. One. Of. Them wore a shit-eating grin. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, but this isn’t for Yule,” Lilia said simply, bringing her wine glass to her lips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Oriana smirked, “Yes, plus we needed </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>here for this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you two refused to plan one,” Jen added. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and her wife raised an eyebrow simultaneously. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Welcome to your baby shower, Mrs. and Mrs. Harkness-Vidal,” Alice now wore the biggest smirk out of all of them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b>***</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha found a gift in her hands immediately, Pepper and Kingo looking far too pleased with themselves as Agatha saw the small scripture of Lilia’s handwriting in the corner of the gift. She tore through the green packaging with ease. Inside she found a stack of burp cloths, each one soft to the touch and embroidered with delicate flowers– some a deep purple like her wife’s ring, others a rich green that mirrored her own emerald on her finger. She traced a fingertip over the delicate stitching, admiring the craftsmanship. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you make these?” she asked, looking up at Lilia. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia smirked over the rim of her wine glass, “Of course. Only the best so all that spit up doesn’t mess up your hair.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She snorted softly as Pepper set them aside, handing her another present as her wife was tearing through paper carelessly before pulling out neatly folded swaddles in dark, earthy hues. Her fingers skimmed over the soft, breathable fabrique. She smiled softly, looking up and getting out an awkward thank you. She held back her own snort of laughter, Rio was always awkward when receiving presents, even if she loved them, she would stare at you sometimes like a deer in the headlights– unless you were her wife. Rio would express her thanks with a sweet kiss that would always steal her breath away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re lightweight,” Oriana supplied. “</span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>and I figured you wouldn’t want anything scratchy against his skin as well since you were always sensitive as a baby.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded in approval, lips pursing like she was trying to hide how pleased she was. Next came a set of tiny onesies in varying shades of green and purple, some with simple patterns, others with tiny messages stitched onto the fabrique. Agatha held one up, reading the words aloud. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“‘Newest member of the coven’?” she shot a look at Alice, slightly emotional, but she fought it down successfully for the first time in eighteen weeks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice grinned, “Fitting, isn’t it? This baby is going to be spoiled rotten.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted but didn’t protest when Agatha set the onesie aside with the rest of their growing pile. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Pepper handed them the next box, her eyes twinkling with mischief. Agatha opened it first and immediately stilled, staring at the contents. A box of breast pads. Alice burst out laughing at her expression. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What? You’ll need them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span> Jen elbowed her, “Maybe don’t say it like that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised an eyebrow, leaning over to look inside and seeing them before smirking with the rest of the group, “Right, can’t have you leaking during lectures, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t hesitate, slapping her arm as Pepper shoved a box in Rio’s hands. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They moved on, both of them being shoved gift after gift. A compact baby carrier came next, small and sleek but sturdy, designed to hold their child snug against their chest. Agatha turned to her wife with a smirk of her own, already picturing it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re going to live in this, aren’t you?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes but didn’t deny it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The next package revealed a set of teething rings, each one uniquely shaped– some smooth, some textured, all designed to soothe tiny, aching gums. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Pepper grinned, “For when they start biting everything in sight.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Another box was filled with diapers– packs upon packs of them, stacked so high that Agatha swore they could construct a small fortress right there in the living room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“To the Mother,” Rio muttered, eyeing the sheer amount. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Oriana shrugged, “You’ll thank us later.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>It continued, each adding their own commentary for what would be good for the baby. They received diaper cream, pacifiers, a few stuffed animals, baby dinner sets, bottles and storage bottles, bibs, a bassinet, a baby monitor, baby bath soaps, a baby photo album, and even a hooded towel. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Their friends really thought of everything. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“A few things are from Thena and Hela too,” Alice smiled, both of them watching Rio being memorized by the plush soft green hooded towel. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Finally, they reached the big box. The wives exchanged a glance before pulling apart the cardboard flaps, staring inside to see more things wrapped up, but they both caught the undeniable color of royal purple.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Kingo smirked, “Best one on the market, ladies– a purple cushion rocking chair with a foot rest. You’ll have to build it, but Rio’s butch enough to figure it out.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>At that, Rio shot him a glare, but Agatha found herself laughing. Her wife did have an affinity for building things and did present a more masculine most days, but much like Agatha, they easily switched between femme and masc. As handsome as Rio was in a suit, Rio was stunning in a dress. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Ah, será perfecto para las tomas nocturnas, Agatha,” Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>cut in, ignoring Kingo. (Ah, it will be perfect for late night feedings, Agatha.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her sister-in-law stood, approaching Rio and nudging her, “See, I told you a baby shower would be worth it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife rolled her eyes, “Yes, but it didn’t need to be this fucking dramatic.” </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nuzzled closer into her wife’s chest, seeking her soul comfort in the morning. Her wife hummed, her arms wrapped around her, one on the back of her head, a silent reassurance that she was alright to do this. Her other hand was rubbing soothing circles on her back, which had recently started to ache. She noticed it during the Yule party and her wife was there without a word. To be fair, she was five months pregnant, with not an overly large bump, still hideable with oversized sweaters, but all the effects were slowly catching up to her. Between swollen hands and feet, leg cramps, sore breasts, hot flashes, pain on the sides of her stomach, and now back pain– as much as she loved growing their baby, she was starting to get irritated. Yet her wife was always there, one step ahead, between massages, a cold rag to wipe her sweat away, a hand on her stomach to soothe the round ligament pains, the hot baths and finally, to her cravings. Her wife was there through it all without a single breath of complaint. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t move when their door creaked open, knowing exactly who it was as she made it a habit for this week. </span>
</p><p><em><span>“¿A qué hora es la cita, mis niñas?” Abuelita’s </span></em><span>voice was soft, delicate as Agatha figured she seemed to be measuring whether or not she was asleep. </span> <span>(What time is the appointment?)</span></p><p>
<span>Through the week, starting the twenty-fifth, </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>had been staying with them before she went back home on the twenty-ninth. Originally, she was supposed to come the twenty first, but Rio somehow managed to convince </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>to come a little later. She didn’t know how, but was thankful she did, especially after date night. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“No hasta las cuatro de la tarde,” </span>
</em>
<span>her wife responded, her movements continuous on Agatha’s back. (Not until four in the afternoon) </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a beat of silence before </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>responded. “</span>
<em>
<span>Deberíamos hacer algo entonces. Podemos comprar pintura o limpiar tu oficina donde estará la habitación del bebé. O elegir una cuna. Eso aún no lo has hecho.” </span>
</em>
<span>(We should do something then. We can buy some paint or clean up your office where the baby’s room will be. Or pick out a crib. You haven’t done that yet.)</span>
<em>
<span> </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stifled her groan. She was too tired, too irritated, and her back was really trying to kill her. As if right on que, the flutters started happening, feather tips pressing against the side where she rested her belly on her wife. It was continuous, each movement seemed to press closer and closer as if their child could really sense that their </span>
<em>
<span>mami </span>
</em>
<span>was right there. It was endearing and in the moment, so overwhelming. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Ya veremos, abuelita. Estuvo mucho de pie estos últimos días,” </span>
</em>
<span>her wife responded unaware of the great war Agatha was losing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha squeezed her eyes shut, willing herself to breathe through it, to keep the wave of emotions from cresting too high. It didn’t make sense, there was no moon to be pulling her emotional tides, and yet, she couldn’t stop it. The tiny movements against her belly weren’t stopping, each delicate fluttering, a reminder that their child was right there– alive, growing, feeling– reaching out… It was too much between the exhaustion, the aches– the overwhelming reality that she and Rio were really about to become mothers– that she defied what the Harkness clan thought of her and created this life for herself. She had a very, </span>
<em>
<span>very</span>
</em>
<span> loving wife– overly protective, perfectly in tune with her, reading her without words, seeing past her walls without judgment, or sympathy, only perfect understanding. Gods, Rio loved her… </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> loved her and somehow already, their baby knew it too as the flutters continued against the side Rio was on. </span>
</p><p>
<span>With that, her throat tightened, her breath shuddering as she tried to swallow it down… but when Rio’s hand slid down to cradle her stomach, her thumb tracing protective runes over the stretched skin, everything exploded. A sharp, gasping sob tore from Agatha’s lips before she could even stop it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife immediately tensed beneath her, “Agatha?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The concern in Rio’s voice was instant, cutting through the sleepy warmth of the morning. Yet, she didn’t have words. All she could do was to clutch Rio’s shirt, trembling against her as the sobs spilled out in waves. Hot tears stung her cheeks, smearing into Rio’s chest. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Mi amor,</span>
</em>
<span>” her wife whispered, her fingers threading through Agatha’s hair, her hand remaining firmly on her belly. “Talk to me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head against her chest, hiccuping through her sobs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“They– they won’t st-stop m-m-moving,” she choked out, gripping her tighter as the sobs reigned on. “They-they just k-keep pressing closer, like-like they know you’re here.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a soft, breathy chuckle, though there was nothing but tenderness in it as her thumb continued to trace runes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“They do know,” she murmured, pressing a kiss to Agatha’s head. “Of course they do. They know their </span>
<em>
<span>mamá</span>
</em>
<span>, and they know their </span>
<em>
<span>mami</span>
</em>
<span>. They love you so much already.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>That only made Agatha cry harder. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I–It’s just–” she sniffled, trying to catch her breath, but another flutter had her gasping, overwhelmed all over again. “It’s so much, Rio.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know, </span>
<em>
<span>mi vida,</span>
</em>
<span>” Rio soothed, rocking her slightly. “It’s a lot. But you’re not alone in this, okay? I’m right here.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clung to her, still trembling, still crying, but the steady rhythm of Rio’s hands on her back, the warmth of her body, the quiet, unshakable love in her voice– it grounded her. Her wife pulled her closer as she sobbed into chest, the wet cotton now rubbing uncomfortably against her face. A flash of anger washed over her as she continued to cry. She pulled away abruptly, pulling at Rio’s tank and ripping it off her body with a loud tear before her wife could stop her.  Rio stilled for a moment before pulling her closer, holding her as Agatha’s sobs tore through the room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you just–” her wife sucked in a slow, measured breath, as if trying to process the absurdity of what had just happened. “...Did you just rip my shirt off?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ignored her… well she couldn’t really answer as the sobs didn’t let up. She buried her face into the familiar warmth of her wife’s skin but nothing stopped it, nothing could stop it as she hiccuped, sucking in a large breath to regain air into her lungs, only to release in a loud, muffled wail. </span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was internally panicking. This had been going on for almost an hour now and she had no idea how to stop it or why it was happening. Agatha’s breath was hot against her chest, which was now thoroughly soaked with her snot, drool, and tears. She had obviously seen her wife cry before, between her being overwhelmed with work, or being exhausted because Agatha didn’t like to sleep (before she was pregnant), and frustrated– but this? </span>
</p><p>
<span>This was different. </span>
</p><p>
<span>This wasn’t just quite the frustration of pregnancy aches or the occasional teary-eyed moment over a book– she cried over </span>
<em>
<span>The Tempest </span>
</em>
<span>the other day… the fucking </span>
<em>
<span>Tempest</span>
</em>
<span> by William Shakespeare. Something about Caliban even though Rio was sure her wife didn’t like him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>No, this was full-on, body shaking, breath-stealing– borderline tantrum sobbing. Agatha was gripping onto her as if Rio would suddenly disappear. And Rio had no idea what to do. She kept rubbing her wife’s back, kissing her head, drawing calming runes on her stomach, moving her hand through her hair, but fuck– nothing was working. She sucked in her breath when she felt her wife’s blunt nails digging into her breast, willing her to stay, willing her to be her anchor. She silently thanks the gods that her </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>gave them space because Agatha’s face was buried between her bare breasts– which you know what, fair. Rio couldn’t blame anyone for that, a great place to cry and when Rio did cry, she needed to listen to her wife’s heartbeat. But, again, this was going on for almost an hour. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“My love,” she tried slowly, pulling her body away so she could see her wife’s face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>To her absolute horror and shock, her wife sobbed even louder, grasping at Rio’s ribs to stay, “NO!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, pulling her back into her chest, smoothing a hand down her spine as Agatha practically clawed at her, her sobs hiccuping into frantic little gasps. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, okay,” Rio soothed, pressing a firm kiss to her wife’s temple. “I’m not going anywhere, I promise.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Another loud sob echoed around her, rattling her to her bones. Nails bit at her skin as Agatha pressed impossibly closer, as if she could mold herself to the safety of Rio’s skin and never leave. Her mind raced, grasping for anything to ease her wife’s sobs. Okay, so maybe this was just hormones. There was no real reason for her to be crying like this. Rio took a deep breath, kissing the top of tangled hair. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Mi vida,</span>
</em>
<span>” Rio murmured, her voice low and steady, grounding. “You’re safe. I have you. Just breathe, my love, breathe with me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a slow exaggerated inhale, guiding Agatha with the rise and fall of her own chest. But her wife just whimpered, trembling harder, her body releasing a fresh wave of sobs that crashed into her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Mierda.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shifted, earning more cries of protests, but Agatha would drown herself against her tear soaked skin. She lifted her wife slightly as she sat up. With ease she guided her wife into her lap, cradling her like she was something fragile. Agatha’s face was buried into her shoulder before she could see it, a hand placed over her beating heart and a mess of mucus, tears, and spit, but her wife barely acknowledged it. Rio fingers moved through the baby hairs at the nape of her neck, her fingers lightly scratching her scalp. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re okay, my love. I’m here. You don’t have to explain. Just let it out.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife let out a shaky breath, gripping a little tighter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It– it won’t st-stop,” she gasped, her voice so raw that Rio was starting to get concerned  how much of this crying was affecting her body. “I–I can’t stop and it’s– fuck, it’s so stupid!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not stupid, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor.</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is!” her wife sobbed. “I–I don’t even-even know why anymore- just I was thinking– and then– and then– and then I was crying– then I was crying because I was crying–” she was gasping for her words, each breath bigger as her words rambled on. Rio, for a moment, was surprised she could understand. “And–and–and I–I ripped your shirt because it felt wrong– and I don’t even know why!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>At this, she couldn’t help it, releasing a breathless laugh and pressing a kiss to the bit of damp cheek that was peeking out. And then, because of course Rio should have realized that her reaction wouldn’t be received well, her wife cried more. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She swore silently, peppering kisses to the skin she could as her wife rubbed her nose across her shoulder as if she were a tissue– at this point she definitely felt like one giant human tissue. Rio reached down, cupping her wife’s cheek, trying to get her to pull away from her skin, but Agatha wouldn’t budge– which made sense, she hated allowing anyone seeing her cry– but her wife still needed to come up for real air. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was time to switch tactics. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Mi amor,” </span>
</em>
<span>she nuzzled against the top of her head, “if you need to cry into my tits some more, I am here, but first I really do need you to </span>
<em>
<span>breathe </span>
</em>
<span>at some point.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife let out a choked noise, somewhere between that annoyed scoff she does when Rio purposely says something ridiculously stupid, a broken laugh, and a small sob. And then, to Rio’s definitely carefully crafted plan, and the one she definitely didn’t just come up with on a whim– Agatha lifted her head, her eyes red, wet and furious. It would have been </span>
<em>
<span>that </span>
</em>
<span>look, the one that could freeze Rio in place, but somehow the lines of tears, the little bit snot from her nose, and how red her cheeks were– it didn’t work. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s not fucking funny,” her wife growled at her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio only hummed thoughtfully, taking her ripped shirt, lying helpless next to her, and wiped the snot and tears from her face with it, “It was a little funny.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, her wife took a deep breath, but the tears didn’t cease, “I hate this.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” she said carefully, throwing the shirt aside as her wife sniffed. “But, my love, you are growing our child inside you. Your body is making a whole new person and keeping you alive on top of that. If you need to cry about it, then cry. I’ll always be here for you, just, if you really do need to cry into my tits, please just ask and don’t tip my shirt.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>It earned her a watery laugh, her wife shaking her head, “I hate you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Impossible,” Rio replied, kissing her but Agatha pulled away, wrinkling her nose. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have snot running down my lips–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t let her finish, pressing her lips more firmly to her wife’s not caring for the fact that they were a tad sticky. It didn’t matter, her tongue had been inside Agatha more times than could count. Her wife melted a hand reaching up and cupping her own cheek before she felt more tears run into her cheeks. She wiped them away with her thumbs before pulling away, resting her forehead against her wife’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you want a hot bath, my love?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She shook her head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How about some hot sauce and ice cream?”</span>
</p><p><span>She shook her head again. </span><span><br/>
</span> <span>Rio kissed her lips, “We can cuddle some more before getting lunch?”</span></p><p>
<span>Her wife nodded at that, her eyes closed as her breathing was deep, easing the tears back into her eyes. After a moment, Rio guided them back into bed, pulling the covers up and as her wife buried her face between her tits again, making her chuckle. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“After the ultrasound, my love, we should introduce </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>to Nando’s and also to nurse your ego when you lose the bet.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>And that earned her a playful, sharp bite to the side of her breast. Rio let out a squeal, instinctively shifting her body to escape, but Agatha withdrew her teeth, leaving a trail of lingering warmth. Rio grumbled, but she couldn’t ignore the knowing smirk she could practically feel radiating from her wife.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">
<b>***</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“¿Estás seguro de que puedes confiar en este médico?” Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>asked coldly. (Are you sure you can trust this doctor?)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio held back a sigh, her eyes drifting to the rearview mirror for a moment. Dark assessing eyes were on her wife though in the passenger seat, watching as her wife shifted uncomfortably, a hand rubbing the side of her stomach as she pushed against the seatbelt that was digging into her. She focused her gaze back on the road, merging onto I-80, driving into the main city. Her hand reached over the center dial, rubbing her wife’s stomach before resting it there. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Sí, la Dra. Walsh es una excelente doctora. Investigamos y nos la recomendó la clínica que realizó la transferencia de médula ósea,” </span>
</em>
<span>she said calmly, but her grip tightened on the wheel. (Yes, Dr. Walsh is an excellent doctor. We did our research, and the clinic that performed the bone marrow transfer recommended her to us.) </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>hummed her acknowledgement before shifting forward in her seat, </span>
<em>
<span>“¿Y puedo entrar?” </span>
</em>
<span>(And I can come in?)</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>No veo por qué no, abuelita.” </span>
</em>
<span>(I don’t see why not.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>She felt a squeeze on her hand, a careful reminder to keep her cool before Agatha’s grip tightened in a way that wasn’t for comfort. Rio looked over briefly, worry filling her features as Agatha was staring at her stomach like it personally offended her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your child won’t stop moving,” she said simply. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio held back her smile, not wanting a repeat of this morning, “He is just excited to tell his mama that she is having a son.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife snarled, “If you weren’t driving, I swear I would end you faster than light can travel.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, “Don’t threaten me with a good time, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>.” </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Abuelita’s</span>
</em>
<span> voice cut through the playful tension, rich with a knowing warmth. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Oh, ustedes dos... Aún así, incluso con un bebé en camino, no son mejores que dos adolescentes enamorados,” </span>
</em>
<span>she muttered, her tone a blend of affection and mild annoyment. (Ay, you two… even with a baby on the way, you two are no better than two teenagers in love.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt herself soften, a smile on her face as she met her </span>
<em>
<span>abuelita’s </span>
</em>
<span>gaze in the mirror for a fleeting moment, but it was her wife who answered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Y no querías que fuéramos de otra manera.” </span>
</em>
<span>(And you wouldn’t want us any other way.) </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ximena didn’t answer, but Rio caught the barest hint of a smile before she turned her gaze to the passing city.</span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<span>By the time they reached the clinic, Rio had barely pulled into the parking space before </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>was unbuckling herself, ready to march inside like she owned the place. Agatha sighed, leaning back with a hand on her stomach, staring daggers at the door. Rio leaned over, kissing her cheek and receiving a small grumble. She simply got out, rounding the car swiftly to open her wife’s door. She offered her hand, her wife taking it with a slight grunt as she stood. Rio was quick to interlock their fingers, guiding her wife inside with </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>on their trail. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Inside, they were met with the familiar bright fluorescent lights and the deep smell of antiseptic. She caught the way Agatha wrinkled her nose, taking deep breaths to steady the nausea as they made their way to check in. As she spoke, she placed her palm over her wife’s belly, rubbing slow, familiar circles. The waiting room was half-full, quiet murmurs of other expecting parents filling the space. As they turned to find their seats, she had her wife and </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>sit as she crouched down by her wife, filling out the form for her, allowing her to point to some of the information as nurses filtered in and out grabbing couples. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The nurse called them in after a short wait, and Rio placed a guiding hand on Agatha’s lower back as they followed. The halls were the same, quiet except for a distant baby’s cry to which her wife slightly stiffened. Rio swore in her head, wondering if she would start crying again. She pushed her along a little faster, her hand moving up and down on her back until the nurse guided them into a room. </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>immediately took a seat in the corner as Rio quietly helped her wife out of her coat, sitting on the chair beside </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>before taking her hand as she sat on the exam table. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her thumb rubbed in circles on the top of her hand, “Ready to lose, my love?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a glare, rolling her eyes as </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>chuckled behind her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Before any of them could speak, Dr. Walsh entered with the same warmth and professionalism, her smile widening, zeroing in on her wife’s stomach, “Agatha, Rio, it’s good to see you again” she smiled before turning to Ximena. “Hello, I’m Dr. Walsh, you must be the proud grandmother.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Great-grandmother actually,” Rio smiled softly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ximena,” </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>replied, shaking her hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Walsh beamed at this as she made her way to the computer, the clacking of keys filling the room, “Ah, so this little one is extra special. Well, let’s begin. Mama, how are you feeling?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tired, my back hurts, and the kid moves a lot,” her wife replied, refusing to release her hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Walsh chuckled as she rolled her stool closer to the exam table, “That all sounds perfectly normal, though I know that doesn’t make it any easier. But you’re halfway there– eighteen weeks, almost nineteen.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio squeezed Agatha’s hand, pressing a kiss to her knuckles,“You hear that, mi amor? Halfway there.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, “That’s still twenty more weeks of carrying your little troublemaker.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Our little troublemaker,” Rio corrected, grinning. “And </span>
<em>
<span>he</span>
</em>
<span> is already proving he takes after me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha muttered something that sounded distinctly like a curse, but Rio just leaned in closer, her smirk widening. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Walsh shook her head with an amused smile, “Alright, let’s check on baby, shall we?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She rolled her stool toward the ultrasound machine. The machine upped to life, the room dimming as </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>stood, coming beside Rio as they watched the screen flicker on. It was the same routine– gloves snapping before something sterile was placed over the wand and the doctor grabbing a bottle of gel. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Go ahead and lift your shirt and we will get started. Today, we will spend a little bit longer looking at baby as this is the anatomy scan. I’ll be measuring baby’s growth, heart and lungs, and we will see if baby cooperates for a gender reveal. You would like to know the gender, correct?” she looked up at the three of them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Rio and her </span>
<em>
<span>abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>said at once. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Walsh smirked, catching the dramatic eye roll Agatha gave as she begrudgingly lifted her shirt. The cool gel met her skin, and she flinched, a soft curse slipping past her lips before the transducer pressed down, smearing the gel in slow, practiced movements. And then, just like that, the image slowly formed. Rio had seen it before– twice, in fact– but the moment the screen crackled, filling with that familiar static grey and white, it still hit her like the very first time. Her breath caught in her throat as the grainy silhouette sharpened, shaping the unmistakable form of </span>
<em>
<span>their</span>
</em>
<span> baby. A tiny foot kicked out. Then another. The baby stretched, arms reaching, legs following, moving with a restlessness that Rio already knew all too well from Agatha’s complaints. And then– a small hand pushed against Agatha’s stomach, as if knocking, as if announcing itself to the world.</span>
</p><p><span>Dr. Walsh let out a delighted laugh, “Well, someone is definitely making their presence known. I’m guessing you feel that </span><em><span>a</span></em> <em><span>lot</span></em><span>, huh, Mama?” </span></p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed, her free hand pressing to her belly, “Every damn minute.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t even try to hold back her grin, her whole body humming with excitement. It was absurd, the way the doctor gushed over something she probably saw dozens of times a day, but how could one not? How could anyone </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> be swept away by the sheer miracle of it? Her heart was soaring, overflowing with so much love that she wanted nothing more than to pull Agatha close, to kiss her senseless, to whisper ‘thank you’ a thousand times over. Instead, she clung to her wife’s hand, squeezing so tightly she was surprised she hadn’t cut off circulation. Beside her, </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita</span>
</em>
<span> stood in stunned silence, her gaze locked onto the screen. Silent tears brimmed in her eyes, slipping down her lined cheeks as she took in the sight of her first great-grandchild. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed hard, pressing a lingering kiss to Agatha’s knuckles. Dr. Walsh hummed as she adjusted the wand, shifting the angle, fingers flying over the keyboard to type down notes. But Rio barely registered it. Because all she could see– all she could feel– was the undeniable, breathtaking reality of the tiny life growing inside her wife.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright,” Dr. Walsh smiled, looking up at them finally. “Everything looks good. The heart and lungs are strong, no deformities, good size– they’re a little on the bigger end but nothing concerning. And, baby is cooperating today. Shall we, ladies?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>They all nodded, Rio almost bouncing as she gave her wife’s hand a gentle squeeze. Dr. Walsh moved with a steady precision, angling the image around their baby’s legs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well–” she said, her voice warm with a gentle certainty. “Congratulations. You’re having a son.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, silence filled the room. The kind of silence that only existed in the space between a breath and something inevitable. Then– Rio threw her head back and laughed. A full-bodied, triumphant sound, rich and golden, echoing against the sterile walls of the exam room. Oh, she knew she was right, everything in her telling her that they were destined to have a son, and now hearing it allowed, she couldn’t help but laugh. Particularly, she didn’t care– she did– that she won the bet, all she knew was that something told her and that weird gut feeling was right. She grinned so wide it hurt, her eyes gleaming with the light of a thousand victories as she turned to her wife, pure delight written across her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I told you,” she all but purred, squeezing Agatha’s hand with all the smugness in the world. “You lost, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor.</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, still staring at the screen as if she could will the baby to prove the doctor wrong, exhaled sharply through her nose. Her other hand came up, covering her face for a moment before dragging down, revealing the pure exasperation in her expression. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course, you’re gloating,” she muttered, but there was no real heat behind it.</span>
</p><p>
<span> Rio leaned in, pressing a teasing kiss against her temple, “</span>
<em>
<span>Mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>, I earned this.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Their doctor chuckled as she turned off the machine, handing Rio a towel, “So mother won the bet, huh?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife groaned, but there was a soft smile aimed at her as she cleaned off her stomach, “She’s never going to let me live it down.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed, all faux sympathy as she squeezed her wife’s fingers while handing the towel back, “That’s where you’re wrong, </span>
<em>
<span>mi vida.</span>
</em>
<span> I will let you live it down, eventually. Maybe after his third birthday or something.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife sat up with Rio’s help, ready to retaliate but they both froze as a soft sniffle seemed to echo through the room. Rio turned, her eyes wide as her heart clenched at the sight of </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita. </span>
</em>
<span>Like before, it was a foreign sight seeing the strongest woman she knew with glistening dark eyes, a hand over her heart as she stared at the screen that once held the image of her great-grandson, nestled safely within Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Oh mis niñas, gracias por hacer crecer esta familia,” </span>
</em>
<span>she whispered, her eyes never leaving the blank screen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The pictures will be at check out. I asked for extra so you two can share with your family. I don’t see the need to order any more ultrasounds. You and son are doing just fine, mama. Although, don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Week twenty-two, you can go ahead and start talking to him. It will help with bonding for both of you. You may notice some flutters in response. The earliest mom can feel him will be week twenty-four. It’s rare if you can feel him at twenty, but possible. As you approach the third trimester, give yourself some grace. You will be slower, a little clumsy, but that’s all moms. If I don’t see you sooner, I will see you for your son’s first appointment.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife gave a small nod, fighting back a smile that was pushing to be set free. Dr. Walsh only smiled knowingly, giving them all a final handshake. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was wonderful to work with you both. Take your time, and don’t forget to grab the scans on the way out. Congratulations again, moms.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment she left, the room grew still, Rio staring down at her wife with nothing but unfiltered joy as her wife wiped a few tears that slipped. She moved before she could stop herself, kneeling before her wife where she stood. Her hands found their rightful place on Agatha’s stomach, her forehead pressed gently to the swell before kissing it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Mi hijo,” </span>
</em>
<span>she murmured, pressing another kiss. (My son.) </span>
</p><p>
<span>A hand caressed through her hair, a thumb brushing against her temple in a delicate manner. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Nuestro hijo,</span>
</em>
<span>” Agatha corrected. (</span>
<em>
<span>Our </span>
</em>
<span>son.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, closing her eyes, exhaling softly and allowing herself to sink into the quiet, allowing herself to sink in the feeling of unconditional love– in a moment where nothing else mattered but her wife and growing son between them. </span>

<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio Harkness-Vidal did not have a dick– no matter how many times she fucking claimed otherwise. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Let it be known that Agatha Harkness-Vidal was one hundred percent certain that her wife did not have a fleshy, mushroom-looking thing swinging between those sinfully sculpted, muscular thighs. If she did, Agatha would’ve been knocked up the moment they started fucking in college, and by now, their house would be overrun with at least ten little ‘mini-me Rios’ tearing through the halls. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And </span>
<em>
<span>if</span>
</em>
<span> Rio did have a dick, Agatha knew damn well she’d constantly feel it pressing against her– especially now that she was really showing. No sweaters or oversized hoodies were hiding it anymore– and also because Agatha couldn’t stop herself from resting a hand there to soothe their little one. Twenty weeks pregnant, and truth be told, they’d been fucking like rabbits, but it wasn’t just Agatha initiating. To the Mother, her wife was always ready for her– drawn to her, mesmerized by her– so the idea that Rio could be losing interest or, worse, cheating? Absolutely not. No chance in hell. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But that still didn’t explain why, for the past two weeks, Rio had been acting secretive. Sneaking out in the middle of the night– or rather, in the middle of Agatha’s naps– leaving her to wake up to an empty house. Or that one time Rio ditched her for that so-called “girls’ night” with Lilia, only to rush off in some big damn hurry. And when she </span>
<em>
<span>did</span>
</em>
<span> finally come home? Straight to the shower before she’d even spare Agatha a touch. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Something was up and Agatha was going to get to the bottom of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Well, once she got through today without complaining about her back or her legs, or really anything. She was miserable and as much as Rio has been weirdly secretive, her wife was still watching her like a hawk, always there to give her a foot massage, rub the knots out of her shoulder, or run her hot baths which Agatha found herself taking more of as her pregnancy progressed. She wondered if she could live in the bath for the last two months of pregnancy– oh, she finally convinced Rio to at least let her work until she was two months away from the birth. March fourteenth she and Rio would go on maternity leave, miss the fall semester before Rio would go back next spring as only the dean.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But the what the fuck was Rio hiding? </span>
</p><p>
<span>It started some time after the ultrasound, when they started clearing out the office that was far enough away from their room to still grant them privacy, but close enough to make sure they could get to him as quickly as possible. In truth, Rio did all the work. Agatha had sat in the new rocking chair, knitting the blanket’s flowers still and fussing with every thread while her wife had sat on the floor in the middle of the room, her hair pulled in bun, wearing black stained overalls with an old green crop top underneath Agatha </span>
<em>
<span>knew</span>
</em>
<span> Rio had worn while they were in college. She watched her wife build the bookshelves, assemble the last of the dresser, and the toy chest. Rio fitted new shelves into the closet while Agatha started organizing the presents everyone had gotten them, including the stack of diapers. Rio built the nightstand table, setting up a new lamp on it and putting Agatha’s breast pump there before they turned to the walls. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was a little shocked that it truly wasn’t a fight. They had walked into </span>
<em>
<span>Home Depot </span>
</em>
<span>and went straight to the paints, grabbing the little swatches of different greens. The moment they got home and held it up to the wall, they both picked a perfect light sage green, and Agatha had sent her wife back to Home Depot to buy the cans of paint. They didn’t paint that day. No, Agatha got distracted by toned biceps and a perfect round ass shaped by those black overalls.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finally did start painting, her wife was hovering, not even being remotely subtle about it. </span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha reached over grabbing the paint roller and dipping it into the tray before listening to the stick of the roller and paint against the wall. As she stretched higher, a hand pressed against her belly, another snatching the paint roller away. Her breath was hot by her ear and it took everything in her not to shiver as the woman behind her placed a kiss on her messy bun. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Don’t strain yourself, mi amor,</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
<em>
<span>her wife murmured, like she hadn’t already said it a hundred times that morning. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, snatching the roller back, “I’m pregnant, </span>
</em>
<b>
<em>not </em>
</b>
<em>
<span>fragile.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Mm-hmm,</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
<em>
<span>Rio nodded absentmindedly, just humoring her. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha’s jaw tightened and of course, she reacted in the most mature way possible. She swiped her fingers along the roller, collecting the sage green and smearing it across Rio’s cheek. Her wife blinked once like an owl, processing the cold paint smeared against her. Then turned to face her, slow and deliberate, eyes narrowed. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“</span>
</em>
<b>
<em>Agatha</em>
</b>
<em>
<span>.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, hiding her smirk as she shrugged, “What?”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Silence and stillness. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Total and utter stillness for a beat… and then a second… and then…</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio lunged, the paint roller clattering to the tarp-covered floor. Agatha shrieked, barely twisting away in time, laughing as Rio grabbed the paintbrush and swiped a bold streak of green across her arm. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Oh, that’s how you wanna play?” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha grabbed her own, flicking paint at her wife’s face and what followed was not Agatha’s fault. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>It was absolute chaos. Paint splattered against the tarp, against half-painted walls, against them as they abandoned the careful precision and utmost order that Rio wanted to keep while they painted. They flicked, smeared, and dodged until Rio wrapped her arms around Agatha’s waist, laughing and nuzzling into her neck as Agatha tried to break free. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Let me go, you freak!” Agatha gasped, giggling. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Not a chance, my love,” Rio purred, arms tightening. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>With one last triumphant move, Rio spun her around, pinning Agatha against the nursery wall, their laughter breathless, their clothes smeared with green. Her breath left her body as the wall held her in place, her wife’s body flush against hers, warm, solid, and everywhere. The change in the air was instant as something warm pooled in the lower part of her stomach. Of course, her wife knew her, knew exactly what she wanted… what she needed. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio drew closer, a smirk on her face as she leaned forward, their noses brushing as fingers trailed down her arms, along her belly, and to her waist. Then, a hot mouth was against her jawline, a teasing mize of lips and teeth, her breath fanning against her as she dragged her hands down, tracing more of her round belly before tugging at her cargo pants. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“You’re covered in paint,” Agatha muttered, though it lacked any bite or annoyance she wanted to show, especially when Rio was right there, pressing against her and making every other thought nonexistent. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“So are you,” Rio countered, voice husky, her hands tightening their hold and her lips placing a hot, wet opened-mouth kiss to the spot on her neck that always made her moan. “But I think </span>
</em>
<b>
<em>you</em>
</b>
<em>
<span> are an absolute mess right now.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha smirked, her fingers gripping at the straps of Rio’s stained overalls and tugging her closer, “Then clean me up.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Her wife chuckled low against her throat, the sound vibrating straight to her core as the sound of the zipper thundered in the room with her racing heart. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Anything for you, mi amor,” she husked, her voice thick with amusement. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>A warm hand ran down her stomach, dipping into her pants and cupping her firmly. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha arched into her, wanting more– needing more as dark eyes met hers, a twinkle of mischief there as her wife lifted her head, their noses brushing once again, “Already this wet for me, my love?” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Stop fucking teasing and just fuck me already.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio cooed at her, “Aw, you are desperate for me.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Rio,” she growled, gripping the overalls tighter. “If you don’t fuck me in the next five seconds, I swear to the Mother– ah!” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Fingers plunged into her without warning, moving in a steady pace as a wet sound filled the room, “Mierda, mi amor– look at you. So ready for my fingers.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha whimpered, her nails digging into Rio’s shoulders as her wife’s fingers moved, slow, purposeful, setting her nerves ablaze. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Fuck, Rio–” she gasped, her back arching against the wall, her thighs trembling as Rio pressed a thigh between them, adding the perfect amount of friction. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I’ve got you,” Rio whispered, pressing a trail of kisses up her throat, her touch unrelenting, coaxing, teasing. “Let go for me, my love.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Embarrassingly, that was all it took and with a sharp cry muffled against her wife’s lips, she shattered. The coil in her lower stomach released as she clasped on her fingers, white hot pleasure crashing over her in waves. Her wife held her through it, kissing along her jaw, whispering sweet nothings in Spanish, and firmly grounding her. When Agatha slowly came down from her high, her body boneless against the nursery wall, Rio chuckled, pressing a final kiss to her swollen lips. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I can clean you more in the bedroom, if you prefer, m’lady,” her wife gave her a mock bow, extending her hand for her take. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha smacked it away with an annoyed huff and made her way to their room. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>The room was eventually painted, but it wasn’t by Agatha’s hand. No, she had promptly fallen asleep afterward and woke up hours later to an empty bed. She waddled her way back to the nursery, finding the walls painted, even the ceiling. The paint cans and brushes sat in the corner, brushes and pans cleaned, and cans lidded. She had smiled fondly, her hands soothing the flutters that woke her. She expected to find her wife in the kitchen making dinner, even though it was technically Agatha’s turn, but semantics– but no, Rio was nowhere to be found. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The kitchen light was on and in the center of the island was a green phone– Rio’s phone. So it meant she was home somewhere. Agatha had called down to the basement, really hoping her wife wasn’t playing that damn video game. It was dark and she didn’t hear her muttering to herself or cursing at the screen. She made her way to the back of the house, looking out the window and seeing the greenhouse light on– target spotted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She let her go, drifting into the kitchen to make, for the fourth time that week, arroz con gandules. Sue her, it was good and kept their son happy– which Rio wouldn’t shut the fuck up about being right and telling her to plan their Yellowstone trip for when their son was three. She didn’t argue, just scowled and tried doing the whole ‘</span>
<em>
<span>don’t touch me, you’re being insufferable</span>
</em>
<span>’ act, but her pregnant body betrayed her, immediately seeking her wife’s warmth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha made her way through the kitchen, her eyes kept drifting to Rio’s phone, her brows furrowed on why her wife was acting so strange and why she was in the greenhouse at this hour. Rio’s phone lit up and she just peaked, she didn’t do it on purpose. She was just passing by, the phone capturing her face and unlocking to reveal a message. Her eyes narrowed, seeing Rio’s cousin was texting her that </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>wanted updates about her every day. She sighed, breathing in and trying to control her emotions. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wasn’t cheating. Rio wasn’t bored of her. If anything, the fact that had just spent hours worshipping her body and finishing their nursery, and also that Rio’s phone was still unlocked for her meant she wasn’t hiding anything… Rio wouldn’t be fucking someone in her greenhouse. That was preposterous and yet…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha found herself going to the front of the house, scanning the street for unfamiliar vehicles before making her way back and had every plan of marching to the greenhouse… that was until her wife came in, a dopey grin on her face and Agatha melted, seeing those adoring brown eyes light up. Her wife had practically pranced up to her like a dog greeting their owner after they had been gone all day.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Cariño,</span>
</em>
<span>” she cooed, placing a long kiss on her lips and hands cradling her stomach. “</span>
<em>
<span>Y mijo.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>If Agatha melted and then stuck permanently against her wife for the rest of night and week, that was no one’s business but hers… but it still didn’t stop Rio from sneaking around and acting weird. </span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<b>Wanda</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She groaned, the shrill of her alarm echoing through her bedroom. She reached over with a heavy arm, turning it off before moving to get up, but a strong arm around her waist held her in place. She chuckled softly, rolling over to find Vision beside her, smiling at her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda had thrown herself into a relationship with Vision, forcing herself to get over Agatha… Agatha who was with Rio Vidal. She would be lying if she said that she didn’t feel her eye twitch every time at the thought. Agatha wasn’t hers and never had been, but what twisted the knife deeper was that </span>
<em>
<span>she </span>
</em>
<span>never said anything, never told her that she was married, never said that she was taken. The woman let her be a fool, an embarrassment, and that was the cruelest twist of all. She wanted to hate her, she wanted to take everything she had, and make her pay… but she couldn’t. There was still a part of Wanda that was absolutely enamoured by Agatha Harkness. Sex with Vision did nothing for her, unless she thought of Agatha, pictured her and each time was lucky she didn’t say her name when she did eventually reach that peak. </span>
</p><p>
<span>So, Wanda had crafted a new plan, one that worked with her reality, that formed to her own script, one that involved a </span>
<em>
<span>real </span>
</em>
<span>university scandal. Vidal was off limits, fine, but the eager students and gossiping professors that were just as bad– all game. Her plan would start slowly, apologize to Agatha, become her friend, and slowly get close, and once she could make sure they looked like ‘besties–’ She could feed little lies around the university. Vidal would be visibly pregnant by the time they got back, and that made things </span>
<em>
<span>so </span>
</em>
<span>much easier. The baby would solely belong to Vidal with IVF, so it was not like Agatha would be </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> attached. If anything, she was probably bored in their marriage now and there was probably a lack of attraction. But, if she couldn’t get Agatha to sleep with her, fine. They would be friends and all she had to do was a little whisper there and another there, and word would get back to Vidal… and goodbye marriage. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nervous?” Vision’s voice broke her back into reality.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned her head, her eyebrows creasing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The meeting today? Before classes resume next week?” he supplied. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda shook her head, placing a chaste kiss to his lips, “No, it will be fine.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She walked over to her closet, pulling on her clothes as Vision stayed in her bed, “Yes, well, forgive me darling, but Dean Vidal didn’t seem too keen on you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She scoffed, but her lip curled, her eyes darkening as she yanked her pants up, “Well, you know what they say about her, Green Witch of the science department and all that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>This was the first time Vision had ever talked about Rio and Agatha after the night at the Yule market. She figured they had a silent agreement not to talk about them and now she did feel nervous. As she made her way into the bathroom, she had every urge to throw up her dinner. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I just thought it was strange. She was so relaxed when we spoke and she was so proud to introduce her wife– they are a beautiful couple, don’t you think so?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda felt like she had been slapped in the face, her foundation dripping onto the counter. She swallowed hard, her hands shaking as she finished her makeup, heading out into the bedroom. She ignored his question, kissing his lips goodbye and practically running out of her own home. Landing herself at a café, she bought a latte with four shots of espresso. She was fine. She would go to this meeting and everything would be normal. She could start anew with the faculty, get on Agatha’s good side and start her plan. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Everything would be okay. </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b>***</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wanda stared at the email again, not understanding why the Literature Department Semester Start-up meeting was in the science building and not in the haven. It didn’t make sense unless Rio was </span>
<em>
<span>that </span>
</em>
<span>pregnant that she didn’t want to walk across campus to her building. She was a couple minutes early, well late for any drinks or food they would have placed out or any small talk. She would show up, listen to the Dean ramble on and then be done. Simple. Uncomplicated. And part of her plan. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Next week, she would run into Agatha, start off with an apology and not push. She would wait, wait for Agatha to come to her and everything would be set in perfect motion. She couldn’t help but wonder how ridiculous Dean Vidal looked as pregnant, how tired and uncoordinated she would be. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She smirked to herself as she made her way down the halls, wrinkling her nose at the fresh scent of chemicals. The conference room was set in the same hall as Vidal’s office wing, tucked in the corner and providing professors privacy from prying students. It was cold and as she grew closer, she could smell the fresh fries and burgers already that were set out as some sort of apology to have the meeting at noon. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Walking in, everyone was either standing or seated, but as always, her eyes found their way to Agatha. She was sitting at the far end of the table, across from an older lady who did not belong in the literature department, in fact half of the professors here were not from the literature department. A tall woman with flawless skin sat next to the older professor and she immediately recognized her as Dr. Kale, a chemistry professor. At the head of the table stood Vidal, leaning against the chair as they all spoke. Vidal was in her usual clothes, a green blouse and fitted pants with her hair in that stupid claw clip. Yet, her stomach remained flat as ever…</span>
</p><p>
<span>That didn’t make sense. She heard her so clearly that day, talking about her little one, unless that was all hypothetical… so, the plan wouldn’t be as easy…but it still stood. She narrowed her gaze to Agatha. Her hair was down, black rimmed glasses sat that gorgeous nose, and a blue blazer on her shoulders. Leaning forward, her arms sat folded on the table against her chest in front of her. To the left of her seat Dr. Crawdad joined in on the conversation and nodded at Agatha and Rio. She bit her tongue, fully stepping into the room and finding assigned seats. She was seated all the way on the opposite end of Agatha, on the same side so there were dozens of bodies between them. She scowled, taking her seat, waiting for the meeting to begin. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good afternoon, everyone,” Vidal’s cold voice finally droned on. “I hope you all had a well rested break. Thank you for coming today and I do apologize for this meeting may take longer than necessary as you can see I have combined the departments. There have been some administrative changes that affect both faculty and curriculum planning, so it’s essential we address them together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda barley listened, her focus kept drifting back to Agatha as she leaned forward, pretending her gaze was on Vidal. Harkness’ expression was unreadable– composed, and almost detached, except for the occasional glance towards Vidal. It was subtle, but there. Something passed between them, something Wanda couldn’t quite place, and it made her grip the armrests of her chair a little tighter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was so certain she heard it that day, “my little one.” Was she mistaken? Was it just talk of the future? Vidal sat back in her chair, posture as straight as ever and no curve of her stomach. She didn’t even look different. She was the same cold bitch as before. Maybe they were in the mists of trying and only now she was pregnant. It was her first child, so it would make sense. Some women didn’t show right away. Besides, if it were true, she had a feeling Agatha would be carrying not Vidal… a bitter taste shot through her mouth as her gaze lingered on Agatha a little longer than what was safe or necessary. She couldn’t see anything below her chest and she looked the same– had the same radiance and glow to her. Yeah, there was no way fucking way she was with child. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The meeting droned on. Discussion of faculty changes, funding allocations, and research projects blended into a low hum in the background. Wanda clenched her jaw, watching Agatha, watching the way she sipped her tea with deliberate ease, the way her fingers traced the rim of the cup absentmindedly. And suddenly, Agatha didn’t seem so sharp, she looked lost in thought, as if she wasn’t even listening to her wife present the meeting. There was a soft smile that graced her lips as her eyes turned, looking Vidal up and down. Vidal caught it, raising an eyebrow at her but continued on without missing a beat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“As we move forward,” Vidal’s voice finally cut through, “we will be trying out combined classes, having professors work together for a common goal in the curriculum. We will be testing an interdisciplinary collaboration that I will personally be involved in. Dr. Kale and I are combining one of the classes full of the freshmen twos. Meanwhile, Dr. Crawdad and Dr. Harkness will combine their classes. That also being said, I have one final announcement before the meeting concludes.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes scanned the room, cool and assessing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“March fourteenth, I will be taking a leave of absence and won’t be returning until next spring semester–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda could have screamed in victory. She could have done a cartwheel right there in the middle of the conference room– hell, she could have </span>
<em>
<span>kissed</span>
</em>
<span> Vidal </span>
<em>
<span>on the damn mouth</span>
</em>
<span>. This was it. This was the moment she had been waiting for. The iron grip Rio had on Agatha would finally loosen. No protective shadow trailing after her. No possessive glances or casual touches to remind the world who Agatha belonged to. She would be free.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“–where even then, I will only be working as the dean. For those who don’t know, this is Dr. Calderu, an esteemed professor in our music department. She will be stepping in while I am on leave and everything will be reported to her. As this semester progresses, I expect you to start turning your concerns to her as she will be stepping up even while I am here. Now–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dean Vidal,” a dark, grumpy voice spoke up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Everyone’s eyes landed on Dr. Morgan, an old anatomy professor who clung to tenure like it was a raft after a plane crashed in the ocean.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is entirely inappropriate for you to be taking leave in the middle of a semester, especially with how you put it : there will be so many changes starting soon. You can not possibly expect this change to actually commence on your leave, having Dr. Calderu do </span>
<em>
<span>your </span>
</em>
<span>work while you sit and do nothing,” he snapped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda relaxed into her chair, sitting back and wishing she had popcorn. This was perfect, and despite it being Vidal, she did have to nod her head towards the Dean– she could put on a show. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal’s mouth twitched, her gaze darkening as she leaned forward, slow and deliberate, pinning Morgan under the weight of her stare. She didn’t interrupt. Didn’t cut him off. She let him talk, let him </span>
<em>
<span>dig</span>
</em>
<span>. And then– </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is utterly unprofessional,” Morgan barked. “And after all the rumors last semester, I’m starting to wonder if there was any truth to them.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>His eyes flicked between Vidal and Agatha with pointed accusation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Silence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The air grew thick. Vidal didn’t react. She examined her nails, her expression blank– no, bored, as if she weren’t being publicly accused of a scandal that could rip her career apart. She let the weight of it settle over the room, let the discomfort sink into every crack and crevice. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, finally, she lifted her gaze, “Are you done, Dr. Morgan?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>He grumbled loudly, but ultimately said nothing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal sat back, a picture of confidence and calmness, “I understand that we had a very entertaining fall semester with mine and Dr. Harkness’ names being spewed through the mud. I was hoping very much to know where that all stemmed from.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not a soul breathed as Vidal met each of their eyes, looking for any sign or hint it was them, and yet each one of them looked guilty as they all took part in gossip that ran rapidly in the fall. Wanda controlled her face, meeting Vidal’s gaze head on, and to her luck, her eyes snapped back to Dr. Morgan, an eyebrow raised. He didn’t flinch, keeping her gaze, daring her to get on with it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If we can actually act like adults this semester, instead of a bunch of inconsiderate, gossiping, teenage–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A sigh, sharp and pointed, cut through her words, “Rio.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal’s head snapped to the side, her expression unreadable as Agatha spoke her name– a quiet reprimand. It was like watching a lion be leashed. Vidal inhaled slowly, then exhaled through her nose, regaining composure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you know where those rumors came from, I expect an email in my inbox and an apology to both me and Dr. Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Morgan leaned forward, baring his teeth, “It still doesn’t excuse your absence, Dean Vidal. You are–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal’s eyes flashed with something, shutting Morgan up as she practically lunged forward, “</span>
<em>
<span>If you could shut your mouth for two seconds,</span>
</em>
<span> I will happily explain, Dr. Morgan.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Everyone watched, knowing not to utter a word as Dr. Morgan foolishly waved his hand as if to say the floor was hers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am taking a leave of absence,” she spoke purposely, enunciating each word with devastating precision. “Because my </span>
<em>
<span>wife</span>
</em>
<span> is carrying our first child that is due in May.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda froze, her eyes widening as she looked between Agatha and Rio, but neither of them paid any attention– they probably didn’t even care that Wanda had the biggest headache of her life, her mind running in circles, trying to place any of the pieces together. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha? </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Pregnant?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Impossible.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Now, if you have any questions that don’t pertain to my personal life, please do stay. If not, I will see you next week. Please take your folder with the new budgets, calendars, upcoming department meeting topics.” </span>
</p><p>
<span> No one spoke, just nodding as they gathered their stuff. Wanda watched as the dean raised an eyebrow, eyeing the crowd before rising from her seat. She turned to Agatha, extending her hand for the woman to take. Turning the chair around, her back to the professors, she stood, her hands in Rio’s as they spoke quietly and what seemed to be in Spanish, but Wanda was too focused on trying to see Agatha’s stomach. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It felt like eternity. Agatha was moving with the same unhurried grace she always carried, her fingers briefly brushing against Vidal’s wrist before she turned. And then the air in the room shifted. The conversations that had barely begun to pick up again died in an instant. Papers stilled in hands. A few audible gasps broke the silence, sharp as snapped twigs. Wanda felt her breath catch in her throat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The navy-blue slacks and crisp white button-down should have been unremarkable, just another polished ensemble in Agatha’s collection. But now, with nothing obscuring her frame, there was no mistaking the gentle, yet unmistakable curve of her stomach. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Pregnant.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal made it undeniable. Without hesitation, she slid an arm around Agatha’s waist, her other hand pressing firmly, possessively, against the swell in a silent claim and warning. It was a declaration to the faculty, one that seemed to rip everyone’s voices away. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Pregnant.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, as always, seemed unfazed. If anything, Wanda was sure there was a smirk ghosting her lips that was one of quiet amusement. Electric blue eyes flicked over the stunned faces before settling on Wanda just for a beat longer before Vidal was guiding the woman out the door and into the hall.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Pregnant. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t move.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Pregnant. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t breathe… because…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha Harkness was</span>
<em>
<span> pregnant </span>
</em>
<span>with </span>
<em>
<span>Vidal</span>
</em>
<span>’s baby. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The stunned silence stretched, thick, heavy, and smothering, like a whale was pressing down on all of them. It was as if Agatha and Rio had taken all the oxygen with them when they left, leaving each of them gasping for breath, searching for the smallest bit of it. Wanda watched with dazed eyes, still unable to move as the others seemed to be in similar states, except for four of them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Crawdad, who would have been screeching in shock by now like a teenage girl, merely smiled softly, gathering the scattered papers on the desk as even Dr. Lune, her annoying fucking partner in crime did the same. Completely and utterly unbothered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The other two, Wanda was less shocked about. They packed their stuff, talking quietly with each other as they even seemed to be laughing at something. Wanda’s ears were ringing so she couldn’t quite catch what they were saying until Morgan’s face grew red with rage. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You knew, Kale?” he snarled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Calderu and Kale rolled their eyes, “Obviously. Why do you think she has me, Calderu, and Crawdad filling in for them?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Crawdad nodded as if she and Lune weren’t part of the problem, “It wasn’t </span>
<em>
<span>that </span>
</em>
<span>hard to figure out. They aren’t exactly subtle.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The room bristled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Archer, a fellow literature professor, looked like he had seen a ghost.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How long?” he rubbed his temple as his voice was strained, struggling to wrap his head around what happened. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Calderu finally spoke, shooting him a bemused look, “Together? Since their college days. Married? Ten years. Pregnant? Well, the baby is due in May.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The reaction was instant. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Since college</span>
</em>
<span>?!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>A ripple of disbelief swept through the faculty. Conversations overlapped in hushed, frantic whispers, a tangle of shock, confusion, and sheer embarrassment at having been so blind. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Finch, from the language department, gaped, “But they never–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“They </span>
<em>
<span>did</span>
</em>
<span>,” Calerdu interrupted, looking positively entertained by the mess unfolding before her. “You just never noticed.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>And that was the truth of it, wasn’t it? All the signs had been there– the way Vidal would linger near Harness’ office a moment longer than necessary, the way Harkness’ sharp wit always seemed to soften just slightly when Vidal was in the room. The stolen moments, the quiet, fleeting touches, the way Vidal’s sharp temper flared the most when Harkness was involved. It had always been there. Right in front of them. And yet, none of them had seen it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Morgan’s chair scraped against the floor as he stood abruptly, his face red with anger– or was it humiliation? “This is– this is unbelievable.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, give it a rest, Morgan,” Dr. Kale cut in, rolling her eyes. “What exactly are you mad about? That two grown women didn’t announce their personal lives for your entertainment?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That the Dean–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Took a leave of absence to raise a child with her </span>
<em>
<span>wife</span>
</em>
<span>?” she shot back, arching a brow. “How dare she.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Morgan sputtered, clearly searching for something, anything, to justify his rage, but he came up short. Dr. Archer shook his head in disbelief, still dazed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just– Harkness?” his brows furrowed as if his brain was physically rejecting the thought. “I thought she didn’t–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>He stopped himself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A fresh wave of murmurs spread across the room as the weight of the revelation finally settled in. Agatha Harkness– sharp-tongued, elusive, untouchable Agatha Harkness– was </span>
<em>
<span>married</span>
</em>
<span> to Rio Vidal. And she was carrying </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span> child. The implications were staggering. The meeting was all but forgotten, faculty members too wrapped up in their own disbelief to care about the budgets or calendars left in front of them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And Wanda, she felt something sting in her eyes and without a single word, she stormed out of the conference room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b>***</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath hitched as Rio’s lips pressed a soft, heated kiss to the curve of her neck, just below her ear. The touch was both tender and demanding, a seamless blend of affection and the quiet, possessive dominance Rio wielded with such natural ease. The warmth of Rio’s hands against her waist and stomach grounded Agatha, a subtle reminder of the life growing within her– </span>
<em>
<span>their</span>
</em>
<span> life. She tilted her head back slightly, offering more of her neck to Rio’s ministrations, savoring the feel of Rio’s breath against her skin, the gentle press of her body as she pinned Agatha to the side of the car. The sounds of the world around them were muffled, distant, and for the moment, nothing existed but the two of them in their little bubble of intimacy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She smirked, her own hand on her wife’s waist, the other combing through the baby hairs on the base of her neck. They were waiting for the Coven to join them for a late lunch, and now, her wife was happily getting the possession out of her system. She let her, tilting her head back, granting her wife more access as the kisses were hot, wet, and perfect, sending shivers through her body. If Rio had her way, Agatha knew they would have been home and Rio probably would have taken her up against the door, but for now this would have to do. She hummed when soft lips made their way to her jaw, teeth nicking softly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You enjoyed that too much, my love,” she smirked, making her wife pull away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised an eyebrow at her, but her gaze was down on her stomach, hands smoothing out her white button up, “Enjoyed what?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She leaned forward, tucking a piece of hair behind her ear, “Telling them that I am yours.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She then chuckled darkly, not able to help herself, “Did you see Maximoff’s face? I thought she was about to pass out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smirk deepened, a quiet, satisfied gleam in her eyes. But before Agatha could continue her teasing, Rio’s hands moved lower, brushing over the gentle curve of Agatha’s stomach with a tenderness that made her breath catch. Their son was growing, a little heartbeat just below the surface, and Rio’s touch was the softest reminder that this was real, that this moment wasn’t just about them as partners, but as parents, too. Their son, even at this early stage, seemed to reach out for his mother’s touch. Agatha could feel it, the gentle flutter beneath her fingers, as if the child was responding to the warmth of Rio’s hands. Rio’s gaze softened as her fingers traced over the swell of Agatha’s stomach, a quiet smile playing at the edges of her lips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s growing in there,” her wife murmured, the brown lighting up to gold as if the sun was shining straight down on her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, knowing her wife was dodging the conversation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“An astute observation, my love,” she deadpanned before cupping her face, getting her wife to look at her. “Did you </span>
<em>
<span>have </span>
</em>
<span>to be so possessive about it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She teased her calmly, knowing not to poke at her too much as her fingers traced the outline of her jaw, soothing that fire she knew was kindling inside her wife. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not that I entirely minded, but you really enjoyed making </span>
<em>
<span>that </span>
</em>
<span>statement.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s grin widened, a playful glint in her eyes, but there was something more behind it– something that could only be described as pride. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have no shame in claiming what’s mine, Agatha. And if the whole world needs to see it, then so be it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Right, how could she forget the number of bar fights this woman had been in over her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re impossible,” she murmured, shaking her head in mock disapproval. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smile softened, the playfulness fading just slightly as she leaned in once more, brushing her lips against Agatha’s forehead. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>. I’m yours,” she whispered, the words an unspoken vow, a promise that resonated deep within Agatha’s soul.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Lunch with the coven was wonderful, minus all the teasing about how their students will react. Jen and Lilia told them about the immediate scene they caused after the meeting, but the weight she didn’t even know was there left her shoulders. As much as she loved the secrecy, the fleeting moments knowing it was just them and no one else, getting it off her chest was needed. They didn’t have to tiptoe around the faculty or students, they could just be Dr. Harkness and Dr. Vidal, two professors who are married and are expecting a son. </span>
</p><p>
<span>If only Rio would feel the same about whatever fucking secret she’s keeping. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment they got home, Agatha changed and fell asleep immediately on the couch. When she woke up, Rio was gone. Again. There wasn’t a single sound in the house and the light was on from the greenhouse. And no matter how much Agatha tried to reason with herself, tried to tell herself the fact that Rio was absolutely obsessed with her, she still couldn’t shake the thoughts that maybe Rio </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> cheating. That maybe Rio was bored that Agatha couldn’t use the strap on her or bored from how much Rio had been giving her. Maybe Rio was finding her body repulsive. She was getting bigger, fuck she swore she was waddling like Meredith Grey. There were new stretch marks on her from her thighs to her belly to her ass. She used the cream for the ones on her stomach, but they were still there and fuck– tears were welling up in her eyes as her chest tightened. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook out of it, sitting up abruptly and spotting that green phone sitting on the coffee table, mocking her. Before she could tell herself that this was a bad idea, she snatched it, unlocking it with tears in her eyes and going straight to Rio’s messages. Agatha’s contact was pinned at the top and well, she knew Rio sucked at texting as much as she did. The amount of blue dots that filled the messages were ridiculous. She spotted some from Alice and some from Lilia, even a few unread from Hela. </span>
<em>
<span>La Familia Vidal </span>
</em>
<span>group chat was silent for once and she half wondered what </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>must have told the rest of the family about her wife’s cunt of an older sister. </span>
</p><p>
<span>So, no concerning messages there. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She moved to Instagram, where her wife used to be so much more active, but it looked as if her wife hadn’t opened it in months. She went to her home page, and unsurprisingly the seven posts on her wife’s private instagram were all of her, minus one where it was Rio’s greenhouse, but her wife still tagged her. She rolled her eyes fondly, scrolling through the pictures of herself, each post tagged with their favorite songs: </span>
<em>
<span>Sailor Song, Until I Found You, Those Eyes, Alkaline, honey, Somewhere Only We Know, </span>
</em>
<span>and that one Taylor Swift song– specifically “You drew stars around my scars”– Rio Harkness-Vidal is a lover girl through and through. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And yet, she went to her direct messages, finding absolutely nothing but her own instagram account staring back at her with the few memes they shared with each other. She swiped out of the app, deciding to go through her wife’s photos, maybe that would explain the secrecy. The moment the photos opened, Agatha’s eyes rolled harder than ever. The woman had pictures upon pictures of her. Most of them Agatha was definitely not paying attention to as the most recent favorite was taken from yesterday morning. She had stood by the glass door leading to their back porch, a mug of tea in her hand while the other cradled her stomach. Her hair was in loose waves down to her ass and of course her wife caught her wearing Rio’s Snoopy boxers and her oversized t-shirt that went with it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bit her lip, scrolling down to the </span>
<em>
<span>recently deleted</span>
</em>
<span> and finding nothing but images of paper work and wood? She froze, zooming in and just seeing it was pictures of different types of wood. She shook her head, figuring her wife must want new floors in the basement and wanted hardwood. Rio had been complaining about the basement floors and wanting something new put down. She moved on to the </span>
<em>
<span>Hidden, </span>
</em>
<span>her face unlocking it once again, and Agatha immediately felt her cheeks heat up. They were all the </span>
<em>
<span>photos</span>
</em>
<span> that she sent to Rio over the years. She ended up scrolling to the bottom, finding one of the very firsts she ever sent Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She cursed in her head, staring at her twenty year old self, in nothing but a thong and a purple thin crop top with “dyke” written across her tits in green. Scrolling up, she watched herself become more bolder from her own hand down her pants, cupping her breasts– yep, too bold, sitting entirely naked in front of a mirror with her legs spread. She remembered that well. It was during their engagement and Rio was taking too long at her lab. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Swiping out of the apps, she sat back, chewing at her lip as guilt crept in, burrowing its way inside her. Agatha knew she was overreacting, there was truly nothing in Rio’s behavior or phone that would suggest she was cheating. As if to ground her back to reality, a flutter rippled in her stomach gaining her attention. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked down, lifting her shirt to stare at her stomach, feeling the flutters growing in strength day by day. At this point, she was certain she could really feel their son’s mouvements. She knew when he kicked, when he pushed against her, or even when he turned, and right now, he seemed to be kicking at her ribs, trying to get her thoughts to stop spiralling. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know, mister. It’s a ridiculous thought,” she muttered to him while caressing the side he was moving on. “Your </span>
<em>
<span>mami </span>
</em>
<span>hasn’t even met you and she is obsessed with you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>He moved in agreement, making her chuckle. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Goddess, she knew you were our son before I even did,” she whispered in awe, her chest aching now.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned her gaze towards the back of the house where she knew Rio was in the greenhouse. The thoughts </span>
<em>
<span>were </span>
</em>
<span>ridiculous. Rio had been attached to her ever since their first ‘I love you’s. That woman would be the last partner on earth to cheat on her, and she hated that she let her stupid emotions get to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Whatever secret Rio was holding, Agatha knew she’d have to trust that her wife would unveil it in her own time. But Agatha Harkness was not a woman known for her patience. It was only a matter of time before the tension inside her reached its breaking point, and when it did, the storm that followed would be impossible to ignore.</span>

<p> </p><p> </p><p>
<b>Students</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Ryan had a secret. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A horrible secret that he even kept from his friends… something that ate at him throughout all of winter break. Yet, it was no secret that Ryan wasn’t particularly the brightest, but he was trying. He was trying so hard for his family and most importantly his little sister who was in middle school and looked up to him. So when a chance showed up that his little sister would get a good word in with Dartmouth University, how was he supposed to say no? It was stupid really. He didn’t understand how he fell for it, but pulled all nighters, nose buried in a textbook, desperate to understand the major he chose– in the moment, it felt like the right call. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was </span>
<em>
<span>supposed </span>
</em>
<span>to be small, something inconsequential. Students had their fun with rumors all the time and Dr. Harkness and Dr. Vidal barely seemed fazed with the marriage rumors, even though he was dead set it was true. So what harm could a little baby rumor start? Dr. Maximoff had approached him, promising recommendation letters, before finally threatening to cut him from the football team– something to keep him in line before telling him what she overheard. He thought nothing but of his career and of his future… so he let the words slip, careless whispers turned wildfire, crackling through the halls of the university. </span>
</p><p>
<span>At first, it was just a joke. A harmless little thing, nothing but a whisper in passing– Dr. Vidal, pregnant? It was almost laughable. She was the most no-nonsense professor on campus, the kind of woman who could silence a lecture hall with a single glance. The idea of her, of the Dean herself, carrying a child? It felt absurd. But then it spread, mutating, twisting into something beyond his control. He hadn’t thought much of it when Dr. Maximoff first pulled him aside, her tone all honeyed promises and veiled threats. A letter of recommendation, a future at Dartmouth secured– and all he had to do was repeat what she had overheard. Just a little rumor, nothing more. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And Ryan, desperate and foolish, had taken the bait. Now, it was everywhere. Professors constantly congratulated Vidal at finals week and at first, yeah it was funny. Seeing how pissed she got, how she snapped at other brilliant minds. In his defense, he did not take responsibility for what Ireland did. That was all her and he and the others had tried stopping her. What person in their right mind went up to someone, accusing them of being pregnant when they weren’t showing, they hadn’t even said anything, and when it wasn’t even a concrete fact whether she was married? So, no, Ryan didn’t have guilt for that. Despite Ryan not being the brightest person when it came to books, he was sure it took simple common sense not to do that. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But the rumors turned, building up continuously like ripples. Professors and students whispered alike that Dr. Harkness was using Dr. Vidal, sleeping her way through the faculty. Despite Harkness being scary, Ryan enjoyed the professor’s lectures, even if most of the time he was confused. Yet, Harkness was an excellent professor, meeting him during her office hours, calming going over what it was step by step even though she looked like she was about to kill him– it was the mere fact she didn’t turn him away unlike the other professors who would tell him “it’s in the notes,” “tutoring is available at the student center,” or “look at the syllabus.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>And now he stood outside of Harkness’ door, staring at the handle, unsure whether telling her everything would get everything to stop eating at him. But then his mind flashed, maybe Harkness wouldn’t listen. Maybe she would go straight to the dean– neither of them believing that Dr. Maximoff had threatened him. All he knew was that Dr. Vidal and Dr. Harkness didn’t deserve their names to be dragged through slander, not if Dr. Vidal was actually pregnant. Just as he lifted his hand to knock, a presence loomed behind him, making him turn, only to be engulfed in flame. He stuttered back, avoiding green eyes and locking into red. His heart staggered as he struck, forcing himself to be smaller than the woman even though he towered over her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dr. Maximoff,” he said, taking another step when she stepped forward, the smile on her face too bright, too forced. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ryan,” she said in faux excitement. “How was your break?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>He nodded his head, “Great– yep, great.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Maximoff’s lip curled slightly, “That’s wonderful. Well, welcome back to spring semester. When is your first class?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He glanced at Dr. Harkness’ door, continuing to back away from the red headed professor, “In thirty with Dr. Harkness. I-I was just going to check in about textbooks before classes began– and-and ask about the final exam from last semester.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She nodded her head slowly, her head tilting and it was communicated clearly, </span>
<em>
<span>I know you are trying to tell Dr. Harkness. Utter one breath, and your football career is gone. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I think Dr. Harkness is in a meeting with the dean. You can talk to her after class,” she shooed him away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ryan didn’t fight. He turned on his heel and practically ran towards the lecture hall, needing a moment to himself. He couldn’t tell his friends. They would get mad at him for what happened with Ireland and even more so– for being so foolish when the rumors were all over that Dr. Maximoff crossed some sort of line with Dr. Harkness, prompting Dean Vidal to yell at her. He was so stupid, so full of guilt that it was practically choking him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He didn’t know how long he sat there, but it must have been thirty minutes as the doors opened, students pouring in and sitting at the benches and long tables. Somebody nudged him, making him jump and he stared up into the bright eyes of Ireland and William beside her. Eva sat on his other side, looking tired as the friend group all smiled at one another. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey dude, how was break? What kept you?” William started. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ryan shook his shoulders, “Oh, just busy with work and you know how my family is.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>They all nodded, before Ireland was practically jumping at him, grabbing his arm harshly, “Did you see our texts?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What ones?” he questioned and they all gasped at him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The three radiated with excitement, as if they were about to drop the biggest announcement to ever grace their lives, but before they could, the doors opened, silencing the room immediately. Dr. Crawdad walked in with Dr. Harkness beside her, but something was different and Ryan felt the colour drain from his face. Dr. Harkness looked soft… in a long brown skirt and long-sleeve pink shirt, her hair pinned up in a messy bun, but that wasn’t the thing. Ryan’s mouth opened to the floor, everything else draining from him as underneath the high waisted skirt was the unmistakable roundness of Harkness’ stomach. In truth, it was like a perfectly round watermelon was tucked underneath the skirt and dress. He turned to the others, his mouth still opened, but they were staring in awe of her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s grown from Christmas,” William whispered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ireland smacked him, “No shit, but don’t say it like that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ryan whipped his head towards them, “You’re saying you guys </span>
<em>
<span>knew</span>
</em>
<span>?” </span>
</p><p><span>They both nodded, “We texted you and you want to guess whose baby that she is carrying?”</span><span><br/></span> <span>He shook his shoulders, his mind swarming. </span></p><p>
<span>“Dr. Vidal’s,” Ireland dropped. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” he squeaked out a little too loudly, the students who didn’t care for the rumors were giving him a weird look while the others were just in shock, staring at their professor. </span>
</p><p>
<span>His friends nodded, “Vidal and Harkness came to ‘The Tarot of the Lovers’ together before Christmas under the name, Harkness-Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And that was with a hyphen,” William smirked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Damn, I figured Vidal would have her name first, or like their last name just be Vidal,” a different student butted in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The group smiled, more of the students acknowledging the ‘news’ from the group, but if the students were being honest, it wasn’t really news– rather a book in a library, water in the ocean– if the students noticed last semester how much Vidal was in Harkness’ office, or vice-versa… they didn’t say anything… at least not in front of them. And when the rumors first started, sure it was a slight shock. Two badass professors– both who could silence a crowd with their mere presence, who could say one word about an essay or lab and make the student cry, both who dominated panels– were married? It would seem like a match made in hell– a match that could only be toxic, something that was bound to explode– but the ‘subtle’ looks between them, the way they even walked together, trying to maintain professionalism– a blind person could see how strong their love was… unless you were Dr. Maximoff. </span>
</p><p>
<span>That bitch’s delusions had delusions. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But as the whole class was now talking about the marriage and then gawking at Dr. Harkness’ stomach, Ryan felt his life flash before his eyes. He started the rumor that Dr. Vidal was the one who was pregnant… not Dr. Harkness. And he went and made her wife, Dr. Vidal’s pregnant wife, seem like she was the center of a career ending scandal. Yeah. He was dead. Deader than Ireland. Deader than anyone who looked at Dr. Harkness the wrong way… but maybe not as dead as Dr. Maximoff… so there was hope. But first, he would have to draw the courage– but also who would he tell? Dr .Vidal would obliterate him with a single glance. Harkness? He wasn’t sure. How do you tell the woman who was actually pregnant that </span>
<em>
<span>you </span>
</em>
<span>were the one who started the rumor that </span>
<em>
<span>her wife</span>
</em>
<span> was pregnant? </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning, students,” the silent cold voice was cacophonous. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The students all stopped, like a flock of birds they were in sync, falling into dead silence and perching themselves as the edge of their seats as Harkness’ piercing blue eyes roamed over them, but they were all entranced by the way she slightly leaned on the podium, instead of her usual strong, straight posture. A hand was on her stomach, rubbing the side of it absentmindedly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Before we began, I am sure you saw the change in schedule. This semester will be the first time we are implementing a split syllabus. Until March fourteenth, you will be stuck with me. We will be going over the fundamentals of Shakespeare, dissecting the structure, the themes, and how Shakespeare built the text itself. After, you will be diving into mythology in literature with Dr. Crawdad, exploring the themes of romance in the Arthurian Legends and a few Greek stories such as Icarus” she paused for a moment, her eyes unfocused as her hand rubbed her stomach more. “I will not be returning next fall, but the fall after. My freshmen advisees, please schedule a meeting with me and I will help you request a new advisor.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A hand shot up, bold and quick before the professor could continue. Dr. Harkness nodded towards the hand.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“When is the baby due?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The question seemed to shock her. She stilled, her hand frozen mid circle on her stomach as her eyebrow raised. No one asked Dr. Harkness personal questions, and yet, the students couldn’t contain themself. Their curiosity ate at them, making some on the verge of falling out of their seats as whispers started up immediately. Students leaned towards her, eyes wide, ready for the answer, as if Dr. Harkness would give it. But before she could snap, the dam holding the river of curiosity finally collapsed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is it a boy or girl?” another student asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Harkness, for once in the students’ lives, looked truly speechless. There was no quick retort, no sneer in her voice, not even a glare. She just blinked, as if she was trying to process how the conversation had derailed so quickly, vibrating with barely contained excitement, students leaning forward like a flock of birds ready to take flight. No one asked Dr. Harkness personal questions—no one dared. But now? Now the mystery had cracked open, and they were all tumbling through, eager for answers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait, so you were pregnant last semester? Not Dr. Vidal?” someone from the back called out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A gasp rippled through the crowd as Ryan tensed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my god, it was you all along.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So is Dr. Vidal the father?” another voice called out earning a few snickers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Obviously,” another student answered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is why Dr. Vidal was extra terrifying during finals?” another person called out.  </span>
</p><p>
<span> “Oh my God, did she find out during finals?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Another gasp. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait, did Dr. Crawdad know too?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Harkness parted her lips to speak, maybe to finally put an end to this chaos, but it was too late.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my gods, do you think this baby is going to get Dr. Harkness’ attitude or that glare Vidal does?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Both, obviously.” </span>
</p><p>
<span> “Then we’re all doomed.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>More laughter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>More voices layering over one another, students tossing theories back and forth with increasing enthusiasm. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait, does that mean Dr. Vidal’s taking leave too? Are you both leaving us?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about names? It has to be something with Shakespeare like Ophelia if she’s a girl.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Someone gasped as others threw their heads back in laughter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Romeo if it’s a boy.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Or Hamlet.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Macbeth!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Henry!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Juliet, obviously.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Laughter echoed in the hall as Dr. Crawdad stepped next to Dr. Harkness, trying to hide her own laughter. The sheer audacity of the class was unmatched, and Dr. Harkness, for all her usual composure, still looked utterly caught off guard. But she finally snapped out of it as the most basic Shakespeare character names were screamed into her hall. She exhaled slowly, her lip twitching as her head cocked to the side. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>This</span>
</em>
<span>,” she said, voice sharper than the blade that plummeted into Julius Caesar’s back, “is a literature class. Not a panel on my personal life.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Silence. A few guilty coughs. The students weren’t sorry– not in the slightest– but they were smart enough to recognize the thin ice beneath them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Harkness let the quiet settle before adding, in a tone that was almost bored, “For the record, no, we will not be naming our child after any Shakespeare characters.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The reaction was instant. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So are you naming it after a plant?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Harkness’ eyes darkened, a glare attacking them and convincing them to take a blade as Othello did… as Juliet did… as Cassius did… you get the point. </span>
</p><p> </p><blockquote>

</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The students were buzzing through the rest of the day, the news spreading not only from their mouths, not only from Dr. Harkness’, but from the one professor they never thought they would hear a peep about her personal life. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ryan felt as if he was going to throw up as he followed his friends into the science building later that day. His feet dragged as the students practically clamoured their way to their seats at the lab tables. Dr. Vidal was already there, typing on the computer as Dr. Kale stood beside her, both of them talking calmly, but Ryan shrank as he heard Dr. Vidal. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure, but I wish she would take off sooner,” she told Kale. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Kale shook her head, “You worry, too much, Rio. Agatha is fine holding her own and as you said, the baby is healthy.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal just shook her head, standing up straight to face the chemistry professor, “Yes, but as you already heard, the gossiping has started, and she doesn’t need anymore stress.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>With that they turned and faced the class, Vidal in her signature green and black, forest green pants and a black tight shirt, but for once, she was wearing short sleeves. Ireland and Eva exchanged glances, practically drooling over the purple flowers on her bicep and the snake wrapping around the other. Ireland remembered the ink peeking from the collar bones when she saw her in a suit at the restaurant and everything in her was begging to know all of them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Harkness is so lucky,” she whispered, her eyes still flicking up and down Vidal. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Eva nodded, “But so is Vidal– it’s almost not fair how good they look together– legit power couple.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>They giggled at that, but froze when Vidal turned, grabbing the syllabi when they caught sight of ink covering her back from the low cut in the back. Ireland and Eva were actually drooling, staring at their married professor. William kicked them both under the table. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Guys, Harkness literally just announced they’re having a baby,” he reminded them just as Vidal passed the packet to Kale. “And we both know how possessive she is of her wife.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>They snapped out of it, Ireland remembering when they came into the restaurant– how Vidal fussed over her wife, teasing her, but taking care of her. Her eyes were only on Harkness with a tenderness she didn’t even know existed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Welcome back, students. I hope you all had a restful break. Before we begin, you will notice there is a change in this syllabus compared to the online one which Kale and I are working on now. We are the second class splitting this semester’s curricular where first we will cover floral biology before moving to environmental chemistry. March fourteenth, I will be taking leave and won’t return until next spring. My advisees, go ahead and email me, and I will connect you with a new advisor.”   </span>
</p><p>
<span>A student who wasn’t with the gossip raised their hand, and asked with a nonchalant tone, “Why are you leaving?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Everyone shrank back as Vidal’s eye twitched, “My wife will be having our baby in May.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Silence. Absolute, deafening silence. And then–</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my God,” someone whispered, as if the reality of it had just hit them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She actually admitted it,” Eva breathed, gripping Ireland’s arm like she needed to steady herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dr. Vidal said it out loud,” Ireland whispered back, her voice somewhere between awe and terror. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The classroom vibrated with barely contained energy, students exchanging glances, some covering their mouths to stifle their reactions, others gripping the edges of the lab tables like they had just witnessed history in the making. Because Dean Vidal– stoic, terrifying, no-nonsense Dr. Vidal– had actually confirmed the rumors. </span>
</p><p>
<span>William muttered, “If anyone even thinks about asking her more questions, I’m leaving.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Which, of course, meant someone raised their hand immediately. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you taking leave because you </span>
<em>
<span>want</span>
</em>
<span> to or because Dr. Harkness </span>
<em>
<span>forced</span>
</em>
<span> you to?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>A few students gasped. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Someone in the back whispered, “Bold move.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Vidal’s eye twitched again, “My wife and I agreed that I would take leave with her.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>William rolled his eyes and muttered, “Translation: Dr. Harkness forced her.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Another student jumped in, emboldened by the fact that they weren’t dead yet, “Does this mean you’re both gonna be out at the same time? No Dr. Harkness or Dr. Vidal?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not a hostage situation,” Dr. Vidal said dryly, but the students barely paid attention, too caught up in the rapid-fire conversation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you staying home to take care of her?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She definitely made you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s the only one who can tell Dr. Vidal what to do– power move.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait, does that mean Dr. Harkness is actually taking it easy?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my God,” Eva whispered, eyes wide with something dangerously close to awe. “Harkness won.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ireland nodded, equally stunned. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Vidal let her win.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Vidal exhaled sharply, rubbing her temple, “If you’re all quite finished– ” </span>
</p><p>
<span>A hand shot up, and without thinking, she nodded toward it, “What’s the baby’s name?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The collective hush that fell over the classroom was thick with anticipation. Dr. Vidal stilled, her gaze flickering for just a second– too quick for most, but Ireland caught it. A softness. A shift. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That…” Dr. Vidal said, her voice quieter now, “is something my wife and I will share when we’re ready.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>And just like that, the storm paused. Because for all her sharp edges and coldness, there was something undeniably warm in the way she said “my wife.” And for a moment, the students saw a flicker of someone different, someone who wasn’t Dean Vidal, Dr. Vidal, the Green Witch of the science department– they saw a flicker of Rio Harkness-Vidal, a soon-to-be mother and a loving and protective wife. The students looked at each other, and for the first time since the entire chaotic first day of classes began, they hesitated… well, that was until–</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, but one last question,” a student said, grinning. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Vidal sighed, “Of course.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you naming the baby after a Shakespeare character?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Vidal’s lip curled much in the way Dr. Harkness’ did, her eyes set with a coldness that would radiate from a dead body. The fearful hush came back, as if the students finally realized who they were talking too. They all bowed their heads as Kale placed her hand over her mouth, stepping beside Vidal, and continuing the lecture before the dean snapped. </span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Twenty-two weeks pregnant, not even two weeks into the spring semester, her wife was still hiding something. Agatha had been surprisingly patient, well if you count patience as the fact that she was actually too exhausted the moment they stepped home. The moment she was in the comfort of her own home, Rio took them to their room, either ran a hot bath or hopped in the shower with her, before laying her down to take a nap. She would fall asleep with half her body on her wife, fingers running through the ends of her hair, a hand on her stomach or Rio would be tucking pillows around her, Agatha refusing to buy an actual pillow made for her, as she always wanted to cling to Rio. She didn’t want her wife forcing a pillow at her when it wasn’t warm like Rio, when she couldn’t listen to the steady heartbeat underneath her ear, nor have her head rise and fall with her wife’s chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So when the pillows were set, Rio would sit on the floor, her hands on Agatha’s stomach, muttering soft Spanish that Agatha was too tired to comprehend. And when her eyes were too heavy, a kiss would be pressed to her stomach, her forehead, her nose, and finally to her lips and Rio, the sneaky bastard, would slip away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And this was when Agatha hated being pregnant. She hated constantly feeling like her emotions were crazy, constantly not having a grasp on them– always overreacting, between snapping at her wife or crying over something simple.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was reading a passage about Ophelia, comparing the original text to movie with the understanding agency– of Ophelia taking the narrative and whether her death was truly a suicide or something on accident. The passage was highlighting the floral imagery of her death in the original text, talking of her mermaid, haunting-like appearance in the brooke surrounded by flowers, and for whatever reason, Agatha thought back to her wife. She thought of the flowers Rio got her for every date up till they were married, even now, Rio would love surprising every now and then with flowers. And with that thought, her throat tightened up. It was embarrassing, the tears welling in her eyes as she had to take a few calming breaths before continuing. For once, the little fucking brats kept their mouths shut. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And she hated her strange cravings. She hated wanting to eat pickles with ice cream, mac &amp; cheese with applesauce, the random Nando’s cravings– or especially craving that one pastry from a café twenty minutes away from campus and it absolutely ruined her day when neither she or Rio could get them. She hated that she was stealing Rio’s portion of lunch too. She hated waking up her wife at three am, begging her to go get one of the cravings, and then having to wait in a cold bed for her to come back absolutely exhausted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then came the pains, when her back would kill her, aching from carrying the new weight of their son. She hated that her fingers were starting to swell, that Rio had to pry her wedding ring off of her with dish soap and then having to wear it around her neck along with the Triple Goddess necklace. She hated she could no longer wear her heels and envied the gorgeous pregnant women dancing at Carnival she saw on Tiktok. In truth she was stunned and awed. There were days where she didn’t feel beautiful, where she was scared Rio wouldn’t look at her with that usual stunned and bright-eyed look she always did– but of course Rio did. She swore Rio was always ready to jump her bones, and when she did have a rush of energy, moving around the house or adding to the nursery, her wife was there, leaving teasing touches, always trying to get Agatha into their bedroom… and it worked every time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But then there were the little moments that </span>
<em>
<span>always</span>
</em>
<span> outweighed the rest. The moments where Rio held Agatha after sex, talking of their son’s future, going back and forth on names, laughing at the students wanting it to be a Shakespeare name. They argued over cribs, and every time Agatha found a crib her wife might like, Rio would shake her head and promise they had time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They spent quiet evenings talking to the baby, lighting up when he responded and Rio was impossibly more enraptured by their son– not that Agatha would ever admit, but he responded the most when Rio cooed at him. Her wife was so excited to hopefully feel their son, constantly having her hands on her stomach and begging him to kick a little harder for her to feel. During lunches and stolen moments at work, Rio would be in her office, fussing over her, making sure she was eating enough and talking to her stomach. Agatha couldn’t stop laughing the one time Lilia had walked in unannounced and caught Rio on her knees, talking rapidly in Spanish. Rio tried playing it off, trying to act like she wasn’t soft, but Lilia and Agatha melted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She loved the moments when she was by herself in the office, well she wasn’t by herself– more like mama and son time. Where she could freely hum to herself or sing softly while caressing her bump. He seemed to love the song she and Rio wrote all those years ago when they first realized they both practiced. It was something to pass the time during the hot summers, where Rio would play on her electric drum set and Alice would be there with her keyboard. But it was mainly Rio and her though, writing the </span>
<em>
<span>Ballad of the Witches’ Road. </span>
</em>
<span>When he was particularly fussy in her stomach, all she had to do was hum the melody and their son would still, hopefully falling asleep. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She would speak softly to him, feeling him flutter in response, but she was hopeless when Rio was there. She swore the baby got so excited the moment he heard </span>
<em>
<span>Mami. </span>
</em>
<span>Normally, Agatha would have pushed Rio away from what she would call being weird. At first she thought it </span>
<em>
<span>was </span>
</em>
<span>weird to be constantly talking to stretched skin and muscles, but she really did melt when she realized her wife was building her connection with him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The final thing she loved about being pregnant was the fact that Rio could barely say ‘no’ to her. She loved watching the gears turn in her wife’s head, the panic in her eyes as she knew Rio wanted to tell her no, but her eyes would flick to her stomach and she would give in… except when it came to whatever the fuck she was hiding. Somehow her wife would barely bat an eye when she questioned her, lie on the spot, and then distract her easily. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And somehow, today she got her wife on her knees in her office, the door closed, hopefully locked. She smirked, leaning back in her chair, pleasure flowing through her body as one hand gripped on the armrest while the other was on her belly. She stared down, just making out a head of black hair between her legs, the tongue warm and insistent. The sight alone sent a shiver of satisfaction through her. Agatha let her head tip back against the chair, her fingers tightening around the armrest as her other hand drifted lower, stroking over the swell of her belly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mmm, my love,” she murmured, her voice like honeyed silk, lazy and indulgent. “You really are so much sweeter when you’re on your knees.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t respond with words– only a low hum against her, the vibration making Agatha’s breath hitch. Her grip on the armrest turned vice-like as pleasure curled warm and slow in her stomach, spreading like wildfire. Her wife was relentless. The tongue against her was both worship and demand, devotion and control. A contradiction, just like her– all that quiet intensity, all that restraint, finally given over to this. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked, watching the dark head between her thighs, watching the subtle shift of Rio’s shoulders as she moved, the careful way her hands stayed on Agatha’s legs, bunching up her purple skirt just enough to allow her to work. Her free hand slid forward, fingers threading through the inky strands, nails scraping just enough to make Rio groan against her. The sound sent another rush of pleasure through her, making her hips tilt forward, just a little.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She felt her wife’s tongue swirl around her folds, sucking lightly before her tongue was shoving its way and inside her. She bit down on her lip, stifling her moans as her wife worked, happily lapping at her from underneath her desk. The sounds were wet and wanton, and part of Agatha was still grounded enough to pray that the sounds didn’t reach outside her office, but the sex-induced part of her found the risk a little more sweet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath hitched as her wife’s tongue moved deeper, unrelenting, drawing out sharp little gasps she barely managed to swallow down. Her fingers curled tighter in her wife’s hair, both anchoring and urging her on. She could feel Rio smirk against her, the slight curve of her lips almost teasing before she sucked harder, dragging a strangled moan from Agatha’s throat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Fuck</span>
</em>
<span>,” a breathless gasp left her lips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife was always </span>
<em>
<span>thorough–</span>
</em>
<span> whether it was in the lecture hall, at home, or in between Agatha’s legs. She was methodical in everything she did, and this was no exception. Agatha writhed in her seat, thighs squeezing around Rio’s head, but the hands on her hips kept her down. The coil in her lower stomach was tightening. She was getting close, her eyes fluttering shut as she pulled her wife closer against her, needing a little more. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dr. Harkness?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha jumped, trying to sit up but Rio did </span>
<em>
<span>not </span>
</em>
<span>stop. Her tongue somehow pushed inside her deeper as she hummed against her, sending a tremor through her entire body. But Agatha had had to move, she threw her skirts over her wife’s head as she moved her chair forward, forcing her wife further under the desk. She barely was able to catch her breath as the head of the literature department came in, already talking her ear off, but she could barely hear him, everything in her trying to not jolt as Rio sucked on her clit. She quickly pushed her wife off of her, slowly tuning in to the boss that wasn’t between her legs.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You see? I don’t trust anyone else. I know you have your-er condition– but it would be a great help.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, going to close her legs when they stopped thanks to a familiar head that moved its way back there. A hot tongue trailed against her thigh, making her breath hitch. She flicked at Rio’s head, trying to get her stop. She was pregnant, too sensitive, and the Dean of the faculty was about to get caught between her employee’s legs– granted her wife’s but still on work hours. Rio wasn’t stopping and she gasped, quickly covering it up by rubbing the side of her stomach and tapping three times on Rio’s head as their safe word. Her wife finally pulled away, but Agatha kept her hand on her head, not wanting Rio to hit it and give herself away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you alright?” Dr. Jackson spoke up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She nodded slowly,  hoping her cheeks weren’t that flushed, clearing her throat, “Yes, the little one is moving a lot today.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their son was actually fast asleep. She started noticing during this planning period, he goes dormant. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You feel that?” he eyes wide, his lip raised upward in a poorly masked form of disgust. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She rolled her eyes, giving him a pointed look, “Yes, I am literally growing a whole ass human inside me. Now, </span>
<em>
<span>what do you want</span>
</em>
<span>?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She growled at the last part, leaning forward. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He took a step back, “Um, actually, I will have Maximoff look at it. You just rest up.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, watching him scramble out of her office and the door slamming shut. She let out a breath, rolling the chair back pulling her skirt off her wife’s head. Rio sat there, a smirk on her face as she exaggerated licking around her glistening lips, but before Agatha could fully take a breath, hands were on her thighs again, a strong grip spreading them apart before she could even register the movement. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife didn’t care, instead she was interrupted by a sharp gasp leaving her lips as Rio </span>
<em>
<span>dived </span>
</em>
<span>back between her legs, tongue stronger, purposeful, </span>
<em>
<span>greedy</span>
</em>
<span>. Agatha’s breath hitched, one hand flying to grip the edge of the desk, the other tangling back into her hair, tugging hard. The moan went straight back to her core, Rio’s tongue circling around her folds, flicking at her clit before swallowing more of her arousal that gathered. Agatha let her head fall back, her hips lifting up, chasing her wife’s tongue. Rio’s response was sinful. She hummed, sucking audible, making her body shudder. Her tongue worked faster, deeper– deliberate in a way that made her thighs tremble. Her wife was drowning in it, her mouth dragging her higher, and higher– until she could barely think. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bit down on her own knuckles to keep from crying out as the coil snapped. Her other hand fisted hard in Rio’s hair as her body arched, pleasuring cresting so violently, she nearly knocked over the stack of books on her desk. White-hot bliss seared through her, her body shaking with the force of it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife guided her down slowly, easing her through it until her body melted into her chair. She closed her eyes as her body relaxed, the tension in her shoulders gone, the pain in her back easing, and her headache gone as a tongue cleaned her up tenderly. Just as Agatha regained her breath, a kiss was placed against her core, making her flinch. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife finally leaned back, but surprising even herself, Agatha was quicker, placing her hand behind her wife’s head before she could hit it against the desk. She smiled softly as Rio was a picture of calm– like she wasn’t just eating her wife out like a woman starved in the middle of a work day. Her wife reached up, grabbing tissues and cleaning her legs before moving her underwear back in place from the crease of her leg. Then her skirt was pulled down fully, Rio smoothing her hands over the bump. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Feeling relaxed, my love?” Rio spoke softly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arched an eyebrow at her, both of her hands landing on either side of her stomach, “You almost got us caught– </span>
<em>
<span>you, </span>
</em>
<span>the one who set the boundary that we should never have sex at work, you absolute freak.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife’s face lit up, her eyes sparkling as she laughed, “Says the woman” she stood finally “who seduced me” Rio leaned over her, placing her arms on either side of her chair, blocking her in “and shoved me to the ground under her desk.” </span>
</p><p>
<span> Agatha couldn’t stop the smile on her face as her wife leaned forward, her nose brushing against hers. For a moment, the both seemed to forget their teasing banter, their noses rubbing softly against the other’s affectionately. The world faded and Agatha forgot they were in her office, in the middle of school day, right before their lunch. For now, she breathed in her wife’s scent, nuzzling into her, and softened when lips pressed against hers. To her dismay, the kiss wasn’t long, it was a tender press, lasting a little longer for something simple, but it was still sweet, still pouring all the love she knew her wife had for her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife leaned back against the desk, her hands resting on her rounded stomach. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How’s our son?” she asked, her voice a gentle whisper. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Asleep,” Agatha replied with a smile, a hint of affection in her tone. “He usually sleeps during my planning period, but he never sleeps through a lecture.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She laughed softly, the sound light and warm. Her wife raised an eyebrow, her gaze softening as she considered the idea. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, that’s because he’s listening to you, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>,” she teased, her lips curving into a mischievous grin. “I swear, if he comes out quoting Shakespeare–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha jabbed her lightly in the ribs, a playful glint in her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don't you dare start,” she warned with a chuckle. “I swear, if I hear one more student ask me the name of a Shakespearean character–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>A sly smirk tugged at her wife’s lips, and her eyes sparked with that familiar mischief, the unmistakable sign that she was about to say something ridiculous. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“ </span>
<em>
<span>‘To be, or not to be, that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind–’ ”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could finish, Agatha’s fingers found the spot just beneath her ribs, causing her wife to squeal and pull back in surprise. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, okay–” she gasped, laughing. “We won't name him Hamlet.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, arms crossing as she leaned in slightly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t you have a meeting soon, since you interrupted my planning hour?” she asked, a playful edge in her voice. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes, rubbing her side as she slowly stood. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Unfortunately,” she muttered, her voice dripping with mock annoyance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smirk softened into something tender as she kissed her wife’s lips, Rio’s hands gently moving back to her stomach, before cupping her face in her hands. Rio’s thumb gently traced Agatha’s cheek. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks for the early lunch, </span>
<em>
<span>cariño</span>
</em>
<span>,” she whispered, her voice full of affection. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reached for her side again, but Rio was quick to dodge, her laugh filling the air as she found the mirror on the door and began adjusting her hair and makeup. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The keys are in your purse, </span>
<em>
<span>cariño</span>
</em>
<span>,” Rio said softly, her tone quiet but full of care. “I have a meeting running late tonight, so Alice will drop me off around six.” She stepped back to her wife’s side, pressing another sweet kiss to her lips, “Text me if you need anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes softened as she smiled, “Yes, my love. I’ll see you tonight."</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">
<b>***</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha felt the breath catch in her throat as tears welled up in her eyes. She couldn’t stop it, everything in her tightening up. Even her son stilled inside her as all of her fears were coming true, everything that once thought was impossible was slamming into her. She was about to walk into her final lecture of the day when she heard it, the gossiping students– she was used to it by now. Wide eyes always trained on her stomach whether she was teaching, walking in the halls, and especially when she and Rio took walks around the quad after eating their lunch together. But this was truly the thing she thought she would ever hear from a student’s mouth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I saw Dr. Vidal hugging some woman and no, it was not Dr. Harkness.” </span>
</p><p><span>The other student gasped, “Are you for real? Hugging another woman? Dr. Vidal?”</span><span><br/></span> <span>“No, yeah, I am for sure. I literally saw it earlier today and Dr. Vidal actually smiled. You know she never smiles unless she is with her wife.” </span></p><p>
<span>That was all Agatha needed to hear. With that she turned on her heel, moving as fast as her pregnant body would allow her as tears blurred her vision. No one moved in her way and if they saw water pooling in her eyes, they didn’t say anything. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment she stepped into her office, she slammed the door, locking it, and opening up her phone to cancel class on the spot before sinking to the ground, her back against the door. Her heart was in her head, pounding continuously and it made it hard to think as sobs wracked her body. She sucked in each breath, trying to control her breath as the baby moved now, sensing her distress, but she could barely bring herself to react to </span>
<em>
<span>their </span>
</em>
<span>little one– to </span>
<em>
<span>their </span>
</em>
<span>son– to Rio’s child growing inside her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her suspicions were right then. Her wife </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> cheating on her– the love of her life foolishly caught by students. She could barely contain her sobs, muffling them by bringing her skirt up and crying into the fabric until she could cry no more. Her body went numb, slowly accepting that Rio really had grown tired of her. And for the first time in fifteen years, she felt like that little girl, scared to death under her mother’s care, undeserving of love, an abomination– something evil… because it was her fault. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Why else would her wife cheat on her? </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was all Agatha’s fault. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t know how she managed to drive home, but the next thing she knew she was on the couch, crying into a tub of ice cream balanced on her stomach as she dipped sour cream and onion chips into the tub. Agatha couldn’t even process thinking, let alone wrapping her head around what she had heard– all she knew was that she felt unlovable and somehow it was her fault.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And yet, when she heard the front door open, the tears dried in an instant, leaving only  blotchy trails as evidence she had been crying, but anger swallowed her like a blackhole as her wif– as Rio came in, hanging up her coat and kicking off her heels. Agatha sat up, on her feet just in time for Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Cariño, </span>
</em>
<span>are you up?” she said just before she turned around. “I have a–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio froze, her eyes widening as she took in her wife’s appearance. Her chest was heaving, a single hand to her belly, to ease the little one inside her as she trembled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How long?” she asked, her words breaking as she spoke, her breath shaking as the question burned her throat to even ask. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman in front of her had the audacity to blink at her, mocking her as she rattled for an answer before deciding on, “</span>
<em>
<span>Mi amor, </span>
</em>
<span>how long for what?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t you fucking dare play this with me!” Agatha snarled, her voice dripping in venom. “How long have you been fucking cheating? Who is she?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman in front of her stared at her as if she had announced she was a time traveller, “Agatha–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t! For the past few weeks you have been secretive, disappearing, brushing me off when I ask what you are doing in that greenhouse– that </span>
<em>
<span>I </span>
</em>
<span>had made for you. And then today I heard you hugged another woman,” she snarled, her fists clenching so tight, her blunt nails were drawing blood. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t move at first. She stood there, completely </span>
<em>
<span>still</span>
</em>
<span>, her face blank in a way that only masked the panic crawling up her throat. Then, slowly, carefully, she took a breath– too measured, too controlled, like she was forcing herself not to react. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>,” she said softly, stepping forward, her hands out like she was approaching a frightened animal. “I need you to listen to me, okay?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha wasn’t in the mood to be soothed, not when her entire body ached with betrayal, “Oh, now you want to talk? Now that I caught you– ” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio flinched. A small thing, barely noticeable, but Agatha caught it. Not from guilt. Not from anger. But from something else– something anxious, frantic, barely concealed behind the gentleness in her voice. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio tried again, her tone patient but tight, her shoulders tense in a way they rarely ever were. “I swear to you,</span>
<em>
<span> I have not cheated on you.</span>
</em>
<span> Not now. Not ever.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then </span>
<em>
<span>why</span>
</em>
<span> have you been sneaking around?!” Agatha demanded, her voice wobbling despite herself. “Why are you hiding things from me? Why am I hearing that you were hugging someone else? Do you have any idea how that feels? Fifteen years together and when I am pregnant with your child– I hear this!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Something </span>
<em>
<span>cracked</span>
</em>
<span> in Rio’s expression. Just for a moment. Then, to Agatha’s shock, Rio exhaled a sharp breath– almost a laugh, but not a happy one. It was the sound of someone who had just realized how deeply they had messed up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, fuck,” Rio whispered, rubbing her hands over her face. “Oh my Gods, </span>
<em>
<span>mi vida</span>
</em>
<span>, I– ” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She stopped, sucking in another breath, steadying herself before she reached for Agatha’s hands, carefully, gently. Agatha stiffened, but Rio didn’t let go. Instead, she squeezed, grounding her, anchoring her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Cariño</span>
</em>
<span>,” Rio murmured, looking at her with something so raw, so aching, that it made Agatha’s stomach twist. “The lunch meeting I had today? That was Hela. I didn’t even realize she went back to work at her university so soon after having Lilith. I was shocked and just hugged her. That’s it. That’s all it was.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips parted, a hot tear finally falling down her face. Rio was quick to wipe it away, her eyes tender, her face softening as a single hand cupped her cheek as the other rested on her belly. Rio was trying to calm, trying to reassure her while internally, Agatha could see the panic and guilt suffocating her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And the greenhouse– ” her voice wavered slightly, and Agatha could see the moment she debated saying it, see the panic still curling in the tightness of her jaw, the way she was trying so hard to stay calm, to keep Agatha from spiraling again. “I– </span>
<em>
<span>mierda</span>
</em>
<span>– I didn’t mean to make you think– Agatha, I wasn’t hiding anything bad, I was– I was just…building something.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She froze, her eyes widening as the woman wiped more of her tears away before pulling back, taking her hand. She allowed her wife to gently tug her towards the back door, “Come with me. Please, my love.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitated. But something about the way Rio’s fingers trembled slightly, the way her chest rose and fell just a little too quickly, made her follow. Her wife was trying not to rush, trying to be slow as if she would spook her like she was a doe. Rio helped her with her boots before placing her coat on her. She smashed her feet into her own boots, sliding into her coat before taking Agatha’s hand again, leading her into the cold evening air, through the snow, and to the greenhouse. Her wife’s hands trembled as she pushed open the door, leading them in. Together they stepped out of their shoes, throwing their coats to the ground before Rio turned to her, taking both of her hands. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I finished last night and this </span>
<em>
<span>is </span>
</em>
<span>your surprise tonight, but I promise it would have been more special than this,” Rio’s voice was soft, but the weight of it pressed deep into Agatha, sinking into the marrow of her bones. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She swallowed hard, her breath coming in shallow bursts as her wife squeezed her hands, grounding her, steadying her. Then, with precise unrushed movement, her wife turned, guiding her deeper into the warmth of the greenhouse, passing the fragrant herbs, the azaleas, and the vines that twisted throughout the glass panels. And there, in the very heart of the greenhouse, was something that made Agatha freeze. Rio didn’t pull her any further, instead she stepped towards the large thing covered in a giant green table cloth. Brown eyes peaked back at her, and for a moment, Agatha caught sight of a prideful smirk before her wife ripped the table cloth away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath ceased for a moment, all the anger and confusion evaporating from her body as she stared. Because there, in front of her was a crib. Not just any crib, a handmade crib. One that was freshly polished and painted, carved with intricate details, each curve and line carefully etched into the wood like it had been shaped by love itself. Each of the side panel posts, meant to keep the baby in, were round, no sharp edges, but the outside of them had protective runes, each painted a mix of green and purple to highlight them from the black, but the headboard and footboard were intricate. Life-like vines wrapped along the framework. The headboard had the triple moon, small carvings of ravens spilling out from moons. The footboard had a tree similar to the tattoo on Rio’s back. The roots wrapped down the feet of the crib, the branches blending into the posts on top. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers hovered over the wood, tracing the delicate vines, the way the carved ravens seemed to take flight from the crescent moons. It was stunning. It was </span>
<em>
<span>theirs</span>
</em>
<span>. Her throat felt tight, too many emotions tangled in her ribs making it impossible to breathe. Agatha’s knees nearly buckled, but Rio’s arms were there, slipping around her waist, holding her steady. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you like it?” her voice was softer now, hesitant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t speak. She just nodded, a small, jerky movement, her fingers still ghosting over the wood. Rio exhaled, her body molding behind hers as her face nuzzled into the back of her neck, her hands resting on her stomach, before she rested her chin on her shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I– I wanted to make something with my own hands for him. Something that would keep him safe, always,” she swallowed. “I should have told you. I– I was just trying to make it perfect first, and then– ”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha barely heard the rest of the sentence, because something was moving out of the corner of her eye. Her head whipped around– the subtle shift in the shadows near the base of the crib, something tiny… something alive. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She stiffened, “Rio.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hm?” her wife hummed against her shoulder, her arms still snug around her waist, hands rubbing her stomach. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is that what I think it is?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Silence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Both of them stared as a tiny fluffy ball of white and tan that hopped out from the shadows. Agatha felt her eyes widen. It was tiny, </span>
<em>
<span>so </span>
</em>
<span>unbelievably small— a baby. A small light brown nose twitched up at her, black eyes wide and curious as impossibly small floppy ears perked up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife grew rigid behind her, fingers briefly clenched against the stomach, the way her breath caught in her throat before she slowly exhaled. She could practically hear the gears turning behind those big brown eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Mierda</span>
</em>
<span>,” Rio muttered under her breath. “How did you get out?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned slowly, one eye on the ground to keep the creature in sight, “Rio.” </span>
</p><p>
<span> “I can explain,” her wife shifted nervously. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Oh, can </span>
</em>
<span>you?” she bit back, folding her arms and arching a sharp brow.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio froze in front of her, her eyes flicking down to the baby bunny, completely unaware of the tension cracking in the air.  It gave a tiny stretch before hopping closer, its soft nose tickling at Agatha’s feet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He was abandoned,” her wife started slowly, her voice soft as her eyes remained on the baby bunny nuzzling against Agatha who fought to keep up that she was angry. “During one of your three am cravings, when I didn’t come home until three hours later and you were pissed at me the next morning– it was because of him. I walked out of the gas station and some teenager ran up to me and shoved a blanket into my arms and when I opened it, there he was. He was just old enough to leave his mother, but he was so frail. I rushed him to the vets, got his shots, and took him home. He is supposed to be in his pen, but he keeps escaping and eating my plants.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” she sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose and closing her eyes. “You got a rabbit, while I’m pregnant.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife cleared her throat, “He’s very small.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, fantastic, that make everything just fucking peachy–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And he’s soft, too,” Rio added quickly as if that would help her case. “And he doesn’t eat much, and very quiet–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pointed a finger at her, her other hand cradling her belly as their son moved, “</span>
<em>
<span>You </span>
</em>
<span>disappeared for weeks, let me spiral into a full hormonal meltdown, and now you’re telling me that it was for a crib and a fucking rabbit?!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife had the nerve to bite her lip, looking uncharacteristically sheepishly. She looked nothing like the power dean of the Westview University– just a wife getting scolded by their wife. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“In my defense, I knew you would be mad if I </span>
<em>
<span>just </span>
</em>
<span>brought home a bunny without something to soften the blow and I had already started the crib…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at her before staring down at the bunny, and back to her wife. Her eyes sharpened, her firsts curling, everything ready to lash out at her wife for being so fucking stupid– for letting her think the worse– and then have the audacity to just be worried when Agatha finally accuses her instead of being mad or hurt. Before she could ponder on how her wife isn’t hurt by Agatha thinking that, a soft little rumble echoed in the silence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes darted down as something in Agatha’s chest cracked. She didn’t even think. She just bent down, albeit, struggling a little, and scoped the fluff ball into her arms. The bunny let out more purrs, nuzzling into her chest and fuck, all the was gone as she burried her face into pure fluff. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I cannot believe you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife, her stubborn, determined, strategist of a wife, took this as an open opportunity to step forward, hands back on her stomach. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You love me,” she murmured, pressing a kiss to her forehead as she inhaled the bunny’s soft scent. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lifted her head, correcting her, “I </span>
<em>
<span>tolerate</span>
</em>
<span> you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife smiled, pressing a kiss to her lips and then to her nose, “And you always wanted a bunny.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her heart soared, tears ready to slip from her eyes from just that one sentence because that… that was true. She never explicitly said it, maybe one or twice the words came out, but they were fleeting thoughts or just a whispered daydream. Usually, if she and Rio were somewhere and there were bunnies, they </span>
<em>
<span>always </span>
</em>
<span>stopped. Agatha would always look, would always stare the moment she saw the little creatures, but it was Rio who always dragged them to their enclosures– at first she had thought it was because Rio loved looking at them too, but now… Rio had noticed her longing stares, the way she would prefer anything with little bunnies on them. She had remembered, had truly seen her– truly loved her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nuzzled back into the bunny’s fur, smiling as it purred contently in her arms as she turned back to the crib before her, trying to hide her tears. Her shoulders were shaking though, and no amount of bunny fur was going to muffle her ragged breaths. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Gods, you absolute fucking idiot.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife laughed, wrapping her arms back around her and kissing the side of her head repeatedly. They stayed like that for a while, Rio swaying them as Agatha held not one, but two babies close to her, staring down at the crib her wife made for their son. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment she calmed down, the bunny was asleep in her arms, his face burrowing into the crook of her arm. Her wife was still pressing kisses to her head, hands easing the flutters. Then her lips came by her ear, her voice hesitant and soft. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So does that mean we can keep Señor?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped out of her grip, “I am not calling him that.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Later that night, Rio had managed to bring the crib into the nursery, setting it up next to the rocking chair before heading back out into the cold. Agatha watched her wife bring in a black bunny enclosure, a few blankets and toys, a litter box, and a bed. She had sighed, shaking her head, deciding not to question this as she held him closer to her chest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha laid on the couch with the bunny lounging contently on top of her round belly, her wife behind her, pressing continuous kisses to her lips, each one of them longer and longer as Agatha’s hand tangled into black hair and she tried bending her head back more, needing to deepen the kiss, to spell out her apologies and her love. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But something more in her cracked as she pulled away slowly, “I’m sorry, my love. I shouldn’t have–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s alright, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor. </span>
</em>
<span>I know you hate surprises and I should have told you what I was doing,” Rio cut her off, placing another longing kiss to her nose. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled softly, “Well, this surprise wasn’t horrible.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They both laughed, Rio leaning back and pulling her wife closer as the bunny nuzzled into her stomach more, his little paws scratching at her. Agatha smirked as her wife settled her against her chest better. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Señor Scratchy.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mm?” her wife hummed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Señor Scratchy. We can call him Señor Scratchy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, nodding her head, “Welcome to the family, Señor Scratchy.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<b>Evanora </b>
</p><p> </p><p>Evanora had spent her life crafting perfection, each move precise, each achievement another jewel in her crown. A childhood devoted to study led her to Oxford, where she graduated early, brilliant and untouchable. She seized her father’s empire, bent it to her will, and became one of the most powerful CEOs in the world. </p><p>Wealth? Endless. </p><p>Influence? Unmatched. </p><p>She even found a decent enough man to procreate with, securing her legacy. And she got exactly what she wanted– at first. </p><p>A thriving dynasty, an heir born to her– a gay thot daughter…</p><p> </p><p>So much for perfection. </p><p> </p><p>She was so close to having it all, so close and then her husband’s sperm had to be <em> that </em> weak to give her a daughter– she could have handled a gay son, <em> possibly </em>, that was more tolerable than the filth that came out of her body. </p><p>If she were ever put through any of the three Trials by Ordeal, only death would hear her say that Agatha was a perfect child at first. Agatha was beautiful with eyes so stunning, she was shocked when they first shined up at her. Her daughter was a gentle baby, barely cried, barely made a fuss. The only time she screamed was when she needed her diaper changed. It was immediate too. She was an intelligent little thing, picking up on her movements, bright inhumane eyes following her everywhere. She was six months when she started crawling, seven months when she started walking, and eight months old when she said her first word. Her child was exceptional, surpassing all the expectations by doing everything earlier than what the doctor said. </p><p>When she was pregnant with Agatha, she was small. She didn’t start showing until a late six months. She was worried. Not understanding why her baby was so small, but the doctors assured her it was only how her body was reacting as a new mother. Agatha kicked a lot though, dancing on her bladder, aiming for her ribs and every fucking organ in her body. That part wasn’t fun, but when she was born, she was a perfect bill of health. </p><p>Everything was fine as she grew until she reached elementary school. That’s when everything changed. Agatha was malicious, but only Evanora saw her in action. She pushed kids on the playground, playing soccer, she watched her daughter subtly foul– stepping on the backs of opponents heels (flat tiring), tripping them when the ref wasn’t looking, and Agatha’s signature move? </p><p>Well, if you don’t understand the rules of soccer, know that you are allowed to push, as long as it is shoulder to shoulder. For Agatha, she found joy in dipping her shoulder down, hooking it into the opponent’s side before lifting them up and sending them sprawling.  </p><p> </p><blockquote>
<p>(Soccer players, you would have hated me because I may or may not be taking from experience when I used to play) </p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>She’d slap, scratch, pull at other girls’ hair, and as she got older, she got bolder. She snapped two girl’s ankles– told both of them to ‘walk it off’– one knee, and Evanora was pretty sure Agatha also armbarred someone during a fight that <em> she </em>started. And this was only when Evanora was present during the few games she came too. </p><p>But it didn’t stop there. No, Agatha was in the orchestra and sure, call violinists bitchy, self-righteous, snobby– </p><blockquote>
<p>(don’t come at me, I’m a violinist) </p>
</blockquote><p>Agatha was worse. She would snap violinists’ strings, cut bow hair, steal the screw from the bow– but that had nothing to do with the fact that Evanora would punish Agatha if she didn’t get the solo or be the concertmaster. It was nothing to do with the fact that if Agatha came home with anything less than a ninety-five, she was forced into their library with no dinner, no breaks, and if Evanora decided to give her daughter the time, a ruler to her knuckles, maybe a slap across the face if her rings were on, or a kick to her ribs if she was feeling so very <em> benevolent. </em> </p><p>Evanora didn’t know when she started punishing her daughter like this, but the moment it started, she couldn’t stop. There was something so satisfying seeing the fear in those large blue eyes the moment Agatha walked into the house, the way all of <em> that– </em>fuck Evanora never had a word for it. Her daughter carried something, some type of strength, of intelligence, that infuriating self-assurance that Evanora never had– and she loved watching it crumble underneath her. She had some much fun watching her daughter shake, but at the same time she was molding her, forming her to be cold as she was, for her rise and taking the Harkness name– no, Evanora never changed her name when she married. She was never particularly interested in men, just needed attachment for her empire– so when her husband died with symptoms of ARS– vomiting, lymphopenia, anorexia– no one thought to look for polonium-210 poison or point fingers at the poor suffering pregnant wife. Case unsolved, put in the vault to collect dust. </p><p>Agatha was slowly learning though, becoming her perfect daughter– until she was sixteen. Evanora was meant to be gone on a business trip for a week. She ended up coming home earlier, finding clothes thrown around the house, a trail of them leading up to Agatha’s room. They weren’t just Agatha’s, but they also weren’t a man’s. Evanora didn’t care, she stormed right into her daughter’s room, slamming the door open, and she almost fainted at the sight– another girl between her daughter’s legs. Evanora saw red and well, the girl was thrown out of the room, and Agatha was beaten until the bruise was too dark to conceal, so she was forced to be kept home. </p><p>Yet, that didn’t stop her daughter from doing something so unholy. No, Evanora caught the way Agatha would stare at other girls, the way she would flirt when she thought no one was watching, the moments during her charity events or other banquets, she was also dragging her daughter by the hair away from some poor girl who was pinned to a wall by her, or in some random bedroom– Jesus Christ it was disgusting. So at seventeen, she shipped her off to a  conversation camp and at eighteen, it seemed to have worked. Agatha finished high school the first of class. Evanora got her into Oxford, ready to ship her daughter off, and prepare her to take over the business. </p><p> </p><p>The morning after graduating, everything changed. Agatha was gone, most of her clothes missing. Valuables gone, except for her phone which was wiped clean. Evanora tore through her room, finding all of her suitcases gone, all of her bags– Agatha was just gone. Ran away, and Evanora could do nothing. She was eighteen and she just finished high school. She called Oxford and they informed her Agatha withdrew from their program. She tried asking her neighbors– asking the one weird Italian woman who lived down the street– she was sure her daughter was Agatha’s best friend, but the Italian woman always refused to speak English. Stupid plebeian. </p><p> </p><p>So, she lost her for a couple years. That was until she was invited to speak at Harvard for their business program. She was walking on campus when caught sight of wild long brunette hair. She turned and right there was her daughter. She was beautiful, stunning… happy. Evanora had never seen her face lit up the way it was. Her smile was soft, raw– so <em> real </em>. Arms were wrapped around her and behind stood a woman, raven dark hair, sun kissed skin, and eyes dark and intense, but they were soft as the woman drew Agatha closer against her, saying something to her. Agatha had turned, laughing loudly, her arms thrown around the woman’s neck. And then it fucking happened, they kissed, long and languidly, woman’s hands on her hips, drawing her daughter closer. </p><p>Evanora gagged, her blood boiling watching the scene. She stood frozen, her mind struggling to process the sight before her. Agatha, <em> her Agatha, </em>who had been formed and raised into something respectable, something obedient, something perfect, was standing there– untamed, radiant, and utterly wrapped in sin. She wanted to scream, to storm across the courtyard and rip her daughter away from the woman’s grasp. But she knew, deep down, that Agatha would not come willingly. That smile, that ease in her posture– it was real. Agatha was no longer the rigid, controlled thing Evanora had molded. She had slipped through her fingers like smoke, and no amount of grasping would bring her back.</p><p>Instead, she had turned sharply on her heel, teeth grinding, fury crackling through her bones like a storm. She couldn’t confront her here, not when she was about to give a presentation. So she waited her time, hired someone to watch her daughter, and found out she lived with the woman named Rio Vidal. Agatha was deep in her fantasy, blinded by the manipulation of this woman, obsessed with the woman– but Rio, some random bitch from Puerto Rico– was protective, possessive even. Her touch was always on her daughter, her eyes always watchful, and yet of course, her daughter flourished under it, under the attention of being wanted, but if Rio knew who her daughter truly was, she would leave her. </p><p>Evanora tried, oh did she try, but when Evanora first met Rio, well it was an accidental run in. She found her daughter’s apartment, the one she was staying in over the summer, figuring the woman would have gone back to Puerto Rico. She pulled up to the rundown complex, slipping past the desk attendant and walking up the stairs until she made it to the seventh floor. </p><p>She reached forward to the handle, finding it turning until it opened, creaking as it went. She stepped inside and immediately regretted it. The apartment was small. A kitchen to her right, and a small dining table as well. A small couch was on the other side, facing the television, and on the far wall was a bed… an occupied bed where the bodies were moving slowly together. </p><p>The raveness was over top of her daughter, her back on display and to her luck, the covers were over her waist. Their lips were locked, Agatha fingers clawing at the woman’s back as a single arm disappeared between them. </p><p>Then, there was screaming. </p><p>The raveness pulled the covers over them, but didn’t move from her place over Agatha, almost as if she were protecting her. </p><p>Finally, the next thing she knew the raveness was standing over her and slamming the door in her face with the fatal click of a lock following. </p><p>
<em>   </em>
</p><p>So she calculated that wrong. </p><p> </p><p>The next time she ran into Rio, it was by chance. She was in her home town of New York City when she entered her usual café. A woman brushed past her, a little too quickly, throwing her off balance. She caught herself just in time to look up into the darkening eyes of the woman. The raveness looked right through her, as if she were nothing. Rio had simply raised an eyebrow, clutching her coffee close to her chest, nodded, and walked around her. She had never been ignored like that. It was… <em> wrong.  </em></p><p> </p><p>Things unnecessarily escalated when Evanora found out her daughter was about to be married to the woman years later. Worst of all, she didn’t even find out through her daughter, nor through social media. She was at dinner with a few, hopefully new, clients, professors at Salemite’s University when one of them asked if she was related to Agatha Harkness. Evanora was shocked. There was no way her daughter got into Salmite’s University. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> She only nodded and gave a snakelike smile, asking with a voice full of honey, “Why, yes. How is my dear daughter?” </em>
</p><p>
<em> The professors’ smiles grew brightly, both of them sitting up, more engaged than ever in the conversation, “She’s a wonderful student. She is my advisee–”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Rio is mine– they make quite a beautiful couple.”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “You must be so excited for the wedding.”  </em>
</p><p><em> It took everything in Evanora not to spit out the wine she had just sipped. Her fingers tightened around the glass, nodding politely as the professors continued with their voices filled with nothing but admiration and awe. </em> </p><p>
<em> “The rings are insanely gorgeous. I know they had been saving so much for them– but I do have to ask, Mrs. Harkness, why didn’t you help with the rings?” Dr. Carvallo, the literature professor, asked, raising her eyebrows.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Evanora stiffened, freezing as the professors’ grew calculating.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Yes, Rio was so worried the jeweler would turn them away when they said they didn’t have the money. I just figured, a woman of your standards and as a mother, would gladly step in for her daughter,” the other professor, Dr. Dylan leaned forward.  </em>
</p><p><em> She swallowed hard, realizing why they had accepted her invitation. She needed this partnership with Salmite’s University </em> – <em> one so could kick her daughter out and Rio, for that matter, and two– her company would absolutely flourish with a partnership with the world’s number one university. But now, it was a trap. They had been skittish to accept her invitation and it all because of her spoiled insolent brat of a daughter.  </em></p><p>
<em> “Well, I have always taught my daughter independence. She needs to learn how to carry herself before leaning on me,” she recovered quickly, or so she thought.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Dr. Dylan cocked her head, blonde hair falling to the side.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Strange, though,” she mused. “Because I distinctly remember Rio mentioning they had no contact with you for… reasons–” she trailed off before finishing, her tone sharpening. “Reasons not appropriate for this setting, Mrs. Harkness.”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Evanora opened her mouth, realizing she was losing them, but Dr. Carvallo spoke first.  </em>
</p><p><em> “Mrs. Harkness,” she said evenly, “while our university prides itself on excellence– on perfection, even– on fostering those who thrive under pressure, we hold family as our highest value. If your company– if </em> <b> <em>you</em> </b> <em> – cannot do the same, then we do not believe this partnership serves the Salmite’s best interests. Thank you for your time.”  </em></p><p>
<em> Both professors rose swiftly, gathering their things. But before they could walk away, Dr. Dylan, the taller of the two,  paused. She turned back, her sharp gaze settling on Evanora.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I thought you’d like to know,” she said coolly, “that my wife and I” –she gestured toward Dr. Carvallo– “were the ones who paid for their rings. We don’t typically involve ourselves in student affairs, but Agatha and Rio? They’re brilliant. And they deserve to be happy.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>It was hard, like a thousand jellyfish stings to her cheek when they walked away, their fingers intertwining. She bit back the slur, huffing before contacting someone personal she hired. Within minutes she had the address to their new apartment, confronting her daughter and trying to drag her out, and then, <em> voilà </em>– a shiny heavy restraining order slapped on her desk the next day. </p><p> </p><p>Next thing she knew it was fifteen years since Agatha ran away and Evanora gave up.  Agatha was no longer her daughter. So, she failed that one– but Evanora managed to convince herself, it wasn’t her fault. It wasn’t. She was perfect. Agatha just had to be the balance– the sinful, disgusting, evil thing. </p><p> </p><p>And then the obsession began. </p><p>Evanora was out one day in the city when she saw her daughter. She was with <em> that </em>woman, their hands entwined as the woman carried their shopping bags. Her daughter was older, still holding the unnerving beauty as the woman beside her was guiding her through the crowd with ease. </p><p>So Evanora got curious. She hired the right person to help her hack Agatha’s and Rio’s Instagrams. She couldn’t risk somebody following them around, but this was enough for now. Their accounts were private, their names only “Rio.H-V” and “Agatha.H-V” and no profile pictures. It was hard to find them, but when she did, she found that Rio posted more often, a whopping seven posts, but her stories were always full of their life. Agatha had only three posts : one from a date of her and Rio, one of their engagement photoshoot, and one of their wedding… almost ten years ago. </p><p>Rio posted everything on her story, spamming it from time to time with moments between her and Agatha. Everything she posted was either her garden or Agatha. Her fingers were always tightening as she tapped through Rio’s endless stream of stories, each one another glimpse into the life her daughter had built– one she had no place in. The stories were intimate, clearly only made to show for the few people that followed Rio :  close friends and family. </p><p>Mornings in their home, sunlight spilling through sheer curtains, casting golden light over a kitchen cluttered with plants. A steaming cup of coffee on the windowsill, captioned: <em> Mañana </em>. A hand adorned with a large emerald ring reaching for it, disappearing out of frame. A sleepy voice in the background murmuring something unintelligible, Rio’s quiet laugh following. </p><p>Then, the garden. Rows of plants, wild and thriving, vines curling around trellises, bursts of purple from flowers Evanora didn’t care to name. Some days, the posts were just close-ups of petals dusted with morning dew, others were videos of Rio’s hands carefully tending to them. One day, Rio had taken a picture of a brand new greenhouse, capturing it : <em> sin embargo…Ella es mi regalo más grande.  </em></p><p>Whatever the fuck that meant. </p><p>But that led to glimpses of Agatha in the greenhouse with Rio. She would be barefoot, a book in her lap, or lying on a blanket, eyes closed, utterly at peace. Sometimes there were pictures of them on the hill in what seemed to be their yard. Pictures of the stars, Agatha’s head resting on her shoulder and stupid a caption like : <em> She says she loves the stories about the stars, but I know it’s just an excuse to listen to my voice. </em></p><p>And then there were the posts that made Evanora’s blood boil and evaporate. The ones where Agatha wasn’t just a shadow in the background but the shining star of Rio’s night sky. </p><p>A video of Agatha cooking, stirring a pot as Rio zoomed in on her face. <em> Mi chef favorita </em> , the caption read, followed by a teasing, “Even if she burns things sometime <em> s </em>.” Agatha shot a playful glare at the camera, shaking her head before muttering, “You’re so annoying.” </p><p>Another, Agatha sitting on their couch, glasses perched on her nose, deep in a book. The caption: <em> She’s been like this for three hours. Send help </em>. The next clip, Agatha looking up with an unimpressed expression, “I can hear you, Rio.” </p><p>And then, the moments that felt like a slap to the face. </p><p>A short, grainy video of Agatha asleep against Rio, her body on top of her, her face buried in her neck, and her breath slow and steady. Rio’s hand ran through her dark thick tangles, voice barely above a whisper as she said, “<em> Siempre tan hermosa </em>.” </p><p>A photo from an anniversary dinner, their hands entwined over candlelight. The caption: <em> A decade and still the love of my life </em>. </p><p>A clip of Agatha throwing her head back laughing : <em> Shining brighter than the stars </em>. </p><p>Someone else taking a video of them while they were out hiking : Agatha jumping on Rio’s back, complaining, “Carry me.” </p><p>“<em> Mi amor–” </em>Rio laughing and stumbling slightly before uprighting herself.</p><p>“Just until we get to the top, my love,” Agatha begging. </p><p>The caption : <em> Third wheeling with these idiots. Someone push me off a cliff </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Every post, every video, every little comment or song that Rio posted, mocked Evanora. She thought she hated her daughter, but Rio… Rio fucking Vidal… </p><p>The obsession deepened. </p><p>Evanora found herself checking at odd hours, waiting for the next update, watching as Agatha’s life continued without her. And then one day, it all stopped. Rio wasn’t as active on Instagram. The stories ceased. Just silence, eerie silence and Evanora got her hopes up. Maybe this was it. Maybe they finally ended the fantasy, but something told her to keep checking, because the posts and highlights were still there. The same “H-V” remained. She had tried checking their work, going on Westview University’s website and Instagram, but it was the same, and she knew they both went by their maiden name for their PhD’s. </p><p>She checked their friends’ Instagrams, only finding one from someone named Kingo. He was a famous actor in Bollywood and tagged them in one photo during what they called “Yule.” Her lip had curled, realizing it was a mockery– a defiance against Christianity. But a large group of people sat on a couch and behind it was this Kingo, a few other people, some old hag beside Rio, and Agatha. Evanora had stared at her daughter, not understanding why she looked so different. The layer of bodies and the couch covered most of her, just her head really showing, but there was a weird softness that Evanora couldn’t recognize. Her hair was shinier, fuller– it had to be a filter. </p><p> </p><p>So every day, right before bed and once she woke up, sometimes during lunch, she checked Rio’s Instagram. Radio silence. Nothing. For six months, there was absolutely nothing. It didn’t make sense. </p><p>It was a weekend when Evanora decided to check her phone in the middle of the day. And finally, finally, there was a glowing orange and purple ring around Rio’s profile. Evanora vibrated with excitement, her fingers tightening around the phone, biting her lip as she sat up on her couch. This was it. After six months, half a year of nothing, of waiting, of absolute silence– something.</p><p>Her thumb tapped the screen before she could think and it opened to a living room, a familiar living room from Kingo’s post. The colors were dark and floral of the home, but Evanora didn’t care for that, she was staring at her daughter lounging on the couch, glasses perched on her nose as she seemed to be grading papers, but her head was turned slightly downward, watching something with lazy amusement, a smirk gracing her lips. Evanora’s gaze moved to a fluff ball– a bunny sprawled across Agatha’s belly. A belly that was full… rounded… not with indulgence, not with a natural curve of woman’s shape, no… </p><p>
<em> No…  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Pregnant.  </em>
</p><p>The realization slammed into her, sucking the air from her lungs. Agatha. Pregnant. Her body went rigid, fingers digging into the phone case. Her mind screamed at her to look away, to close the app, to do anything other than sit there, helpless, as the world reshaped itself before her eyes. But she couldn’t. Because the video continued. </p><p>The rabbit twitched its nose, purring and nuzzling further into her daughter. Agatha released a soft chuckle, a finger scratching behind its ears. Then– a honeyed hand with an amethyst ring, ran over the curve and around the bunny. Evanora’s heart was beating in her skull, smacking against it like a baseball bat continuously, as if her brains were getting bashed out from the inside- out. </p><p>“I think Señor Scratchy can feel the baby,” Agatha murmured.</p><p>Rio scoffed, a fake annoyance in her voice, “Amazing, my child has yet to grace me with a kick, but the rabbit gets to feel special.”</p><p>Her daughtered laughed, low and warm, tilting her head back against the couch cushions, “I think <em> our </em> child knows he is harmless.” </p><p>The woman behind the camera let out a mock gasp, her palm pressing more firmly against her stomach, “Please, that demon has bitten more times than I can count ever since he chose you over me– and <em> I </em> rescued him.” </p><p>The bunny twitched his nose, but didn’t move. </p><p>Her daughter just laughed again, “You’ll feel our baby soon, my love. Have a little more patience.” </p><p>Evanora looked down at the caption before the story closed out : <em> Bested by a fucking bunny </em>.</p><p>She sat frozen, her entire body locked in place like cement had hardened onto her ligaments and bones. Her breathing came out ragged as everything turned red, her grip so hard, part of her screen cracked, but she didn’t care– because her abomination of a daughter– her evil, wicked child was not only ‘married’ that woman, but was having her child. </p><p> </p><p>And you would be a fool to think Evanora was going to sit back and do nothing. </p><p> </p><p>Restraining order be damned.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Her weight moved off the podium as she read from <em> The Tempest, </em>her voice carrying into the silence of the hall, with only the few scribbling of pens echoing underneath her. She needed to move, focusing all her attention on reading instead of the constant pushes and pronounced flutterings inside her belly. Her son was restless, for some reason not calming as she read. Normally, when she was reading out loud to the class, he would still, calm down, a few movements, but nothing like what was happening right now. He was aiming for her ribs, luckily not her bladder, but it was more than uncomfortable. She walked the length in front of the room, rubbing her stomach as she softened her voice, needing the troublemaker inside her to calm down. Twenty-four weeks pregnant and maybe Rio was right, maybe she should have taken the semester off too.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<em> This island’s mine by Sycorax, my mother,  </em>
</p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center"><em> Water with berries in ’t, and teach me how– </em> (1.2. 396-400).</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stopped mid-line, something nudging against her palm– quick, fleeting. Just the slightest press, barely there. She swallowed, clearing her throat. It didn’t happen again, so she kept going, her voice steady as it filled the room.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<em> To name the bigger light and how the less,  </em>
</p><p align="center">
<em> That burn by day and night. And then I loved thee,  </em>
</p><p align="center">

</p><p align="center"><em> Cursed be I that did so!... </em>(1.2. 401-405).</p><p> </p><p>Another nudge. </p><p>Stronger this time. </p><p>Agatha froze. </p><p>Their son– he just kicked. Right in the middle of a damn lecture. And this time, she felt it against her palm. A second nudge nearly made her drop the massive book in her hand. She cleared her throat again, fingers gripping the cover tighter, and forced herself to move back toward the podium. Of course he decided to do this now. Not when she was home. Not when Rio spent hours rubbing her stomach, whispering in Spanish, practically begging him to move. Not when Rio had fallen asleep with her hand resting over where he grew, waiting– hoping– pleading for a single little kick. Not when he kept her up at night, rolling and stretching like he had a whole damn playground in there. No. He picked now. Right in the middle of class. In front of an entire hall of nosy college students. While she was reading Shakespeare.</p><p><em> Definitely Rio’s kid, </em>she thought fondly, rubbing her belly more as silence filled the hall. </p><p>She didn’t notice, no, she was somewhere else, feeling him press against the palm of her hand, announcing his presence. She tried moving her hand in circles, hoping he would settle, but he only responded with another kick, as if reveling in his ability to throw her off balance. She almost chuckled, but she stifled it with a soft hum, realizing she desperately needed to finish the reading. The students were staring at her now, expectant– but mostly confused, but for some reason, she couldn’t pull herself out of her shock. </p><p>“Dr. Harkness?” a voice finally cut through to her. </p><p>She snapped her head up, looking up at William. </p><p>“Are you alright?” </p><p>She nodded her head, “Yes, go ahead and finish the passage and then whenever you are ready, get into small groups and discuss the relationship between Caliban and Prospero. And then, go back through and highlight passages like this one that underlines the ideas of power and colonization.”</p><p>Agatha sat back in a chair she had recently brought in when she taught. Two hours of being continuously on her feet were killing her, and she was only forty-five minutes into this lecture– an hour and fifteen minutes. Okay, she could do this, and then she had to wait another thirty minutes in Rio’s office… so, an hour and forty-five minutes… </p><p> She flipped absentmindedly through the book, rubbing her stomach as her son continued to press against her palm. Tiny punches landed like she was training the next Muhammad Ali. It wasn’t enough to physically take her breath away, more the shock factor. Every twitch she could feel now, and fuck, this was definitely going to be a long three more months. Another push against her palm made her freeze, staring down at her stomach expectedly.</p><p><em> Easy, love. I hear you. You just have to wait to surprise Mami, </em>she thought to him, in some way hoping he could understand her and would settle. </p><p>He didn’t. He just turned in her stomach, maybe a hand pushing against her this time. She inhaled sharply, mostly out of annoyance of not being able to pull herself together as the minutes ticked by. She rubbed her stomach more firmly, needing him to settle, to still– go to sleep– but he simply jolted? Maybe it was a sneeze? A hiccup? She read somewhere that she would start being able to tell more of his movements now, but he was so restless, as if he constantly needed to move… like his <em> mami </em> . She would have to talk to <em> Abuelita </em>and see if she knew what Rio was like in the womb. She felt her eyebrows pinch together as he continued. She tried schooling it back, but she could not, especially now that she felt more eyes on her in the silence. </p><p>The students noticed. They weren’t saying anything– oh, of course not. They got their freebee on the first day. Despite her current state, she was pleased to know that the students found her somehow almost scarier, but now? The air had shifted, thick with uncertainty. Their gazes darted towards her and away again, like nervous birds. </p><p>She turned a page in her book without reading a single word. A few students exchanged wary glances. One of them– Cassandra, or maybe Carolina– tilted her head slightly, as if on the verge of speaking, but thought better of it. Smart girl. </p><p>Another nudge made Agatha jump in surprise, her head snapping down to her stomach again, <em> Not now, love, please. Mama needs to get through this. </em></p><p>Silence stretched in the room, awkward and expectant. The students weren’t discussing. Weren’t flipping through their books. They were watching. Agatha exhaled slowly, trying to regain some semblance of control. </p><p>“Start the discussion,” she instructed, her voice thinner than she would’ve liked. “I don’t want to hear silence.” </p><p>Chairs scraped against the floor as the students shuffled into small groups, the forced hum of conversation rising, but Agatha barely registered it. Her son wasn’t letting up. He kept rolling, pressing, twitching, maybe hiccuping. It wasn’t just movement– it was urgency. She placed both hands on her stomach this time, as if they alone could decipher the message. Was he just restless? Or– she swallowed hard, tears pooling in her eyes in a sudden wave– was something wrong? </p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Students</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Eva and Ireland exchanged glances as class came to an end. It was clear in their minds– there was something wrong with their professor. Dr. Harkness’ hands were constantly on her stomach during the period and for once, she wasn’t engaging– wasn’t going on with her elaborate lectures or even the normal condescending remarks on the characters. Instead, she looked human. Eva looked up, finding the professor leaning on the podium, her gaze down and brow furrowed. She shifted in her seat, a mix of concern and confusion spreading through her body as Harkness rubbed her stomach again, as if soothing the baby. Perhaps the baby was kicking. Eva couldn’t help but wonder what that was like, to have tiny clumps of cells slowly form into a tiny human and then carry that human with your organs rearranging. She shivered. </p><p>She glanced at Ireland again, “You think she is okay? I have never seen her so <em> human </em>.” </p><p>Ireland chuckled, looking up at the professor, “The baby must move a lot. I’m sure she is fine. My sister’s baby constantly pressed against her ribs.” </p><p>Eva nodded slowly as Harkness straightened up, her eyes glancing around the hall before taking a slow measured breath, before she spoke softer than any of them had heard, “Go ahead and start looking into Ariel. Come in with highlighted evidence for themes of freedom between him and Caliban. I will see you all Friday. Class dismissed.”</p><p>Eva and Ireland packed up, collecting their pens and binders as most of the students left, leaving just them, a few stragglers, and Harkness. </p><p>“You want to head to the lounge in the science hall until Vidal’s?” Ireland asked as she threw her coat on. </p><p>Eva nodded, grabbing her bag as they headed out into the hall. They both froze for a moment, noticing Harkness in front of them, weaving through the crowd of students with surprising speed for a pregnant woman. They remained quiet as they stepped out into the sun, the snow gone from the side walks, the sun melting what was left in the grass. Eva smiled, soaking in the rays as they crossed into the center of the quad, still behind Harkness. </p><p>“You think she is going to wait in her wife’s office?” Ireland whispered. </p><p>Eva nodded, “No other reason to be going to the science department.”</p><p>They tried keeping their distance, feeling awkward to walk too close to the professor, but then Harkness froze, stopping all at once, before trying to take a step back. The two glanced at each other, but then the air changed, something cold set and for a moment, it was like the clouds covered the sun. Ireland tensed beside her, and when she followed Harkness’ frozen gaze, she understood. </p><p>A woman was approaching quickly, her strides swift and furious. She carried herself with a cruel smirk twisting her lips and the air was shifting into something traitorously cold. She moved fast for an old woman, lacking the usual calm, cautious steps, but instead, her presence was commanding– not in the calm, cold collected way the Dean was nor the steady confidence of Dr. Harkness. No, this woman held all the poise of a viper, carrying a poison rooted deep within her. </p><p>Eva really looked at the woman, noting the ice blue eyes– they weren’t as sharp nor as bright, but the cheekbones and long hair was undeniable. They <em> had </em>to be related. Ireland and Eva moved around them, sensing to stay back, but something made Ireland freeze a couple yards away. Dr. Harkness didn’t notice her though, didn’t tell her stop gawking or ask if she was practicing catching flies with her mouth, instead; Dr. Harkness was eyeing the woman, her gaze hardening into something equally cruel as her lip sneered, but the hands that were at her side were now protectively on her belly. </p><p>“Come on–” Eva tried to pull her away but Ireland stood her ground just as the woman stopped inches away. </p><p>“Agatha,” the woman cooed, her voice laced with saccharine venom. “This has gone on long enough.”</p><p>Dr. Harkness rolled her eyes, “Mother, didn’t realize you grew a pair of balls– breaking the restraining order and such.” </p><p>Harkness flicked her fingers at her like she was nothing, but Ireland felt her heart pounding in her chest, <em> Mother? Restraining order?  </em></p><p>She looked quickly to Eva, whispering, “That’s her mom?” </p><p>Eva nodded her head slowly, nearly stunned to stone, “And she broke a restraining order.” </p><p>Their gazes were locked on the scene, on Dr. Harkness, an unshakeable professor whose eyes were now flicking around, as her fingers twitched anxiously on her stomach. Harkness pursed her lips, feigning boredom, but it may as well have been spelled in bold, Times New Roman, eighteen– <em> she was shaken </em>. </p><p>The woman, Harkness’ mother, took a step forward, pinning her daughter in place. Her voice dipped lower, but not low enough as a deep ichor reeked from the crone’s mouth itself, shrivelling Ireland’s and Eva’s ears. </p><p>“You thought you could keep this from me?” a crooked finger pointed down to her stomach. “Carrying that<em> woman’s </em> child. Carrying something so <em> unnatural </em>?” </p><p>Evanora’s voice dripped with malice, her lip curling in repugnance as if someone had presented her a freshly ripped out esophagus instead of looking at her pregnant daughter. Ireland felt a bile rise to her throat as Eva’s fists clenched, and yet they couldn’t pull away, their eyes locked on the scene before them. The acrimony exuded ran deep, cutting into flesh, making everyone within the quad look up, their faces paling as the students realized who the woman was facing off with. </p><p>Harkness, however, didn’t move, didn’t flinch. If anything, the sneer on her lips deepened. </p><p>“Oh, I’m sorry,” she drawled, her voice cutting like glass. “Did my life somehow inconvenience you? I’d ask how you even found out, but I assume you’ve been hacking through my wife’s socials like the deranged hag you are.” </p><p>Evanora’s eyes flashed dangerously, “You disgust me.” </p><p>The professor just sighed, adjusting her stance ever so slightly– protectively, instinctively, her hands cradling the swell of her stomach, “Well, the feeling’s mutual.” </p><p>Ireland barely breathed just as Eva tugged on her sleeve. They didn’t need words as they sprinted to the science building. Their hearts were thudding against their ribs, the need, the urgency– necessity to find <em> her. </em>They sprinted straight to the office, finding a graduate student sorting through papers annoyed at the desk. </p><p>“Dr. Vidal?” Ireland breathed out urgency. </p><p>“In a lecture. She will done soon–” <br/>“Where?” Eva demanded, finally getting the man to look at them. </p><p>He raised his head in defiance, “<em> I </em> am <em> not </em> getting trouble for whatever you two idiots want to start with the dean. The semester just started and I don’t need Dean Vidal breathing down my neck after what <em> you </em>said to her.” </p><p>Ireland felt her own lip curl, snapping as she stepped forward with a force that made the graduate student falter, “Her wife is in trouble– in the quad, right now, with a woman who broke a restraining order.” </p><p>The man blinked, his lips parting– somehow still holding the fucking adacity– but Eva leaned in, sharpening her voice that ran chills through her best friend’s body, “<em> Where is Dr. Vidal?” </em></p><p>He swallowed hard, “257.” </p><p>The pair bolted, ignoring the burning in their legs as they climbed the first flight of stairs to the second floor. They didn’t stop, their feet slapping loudly against the polished floor as they reached the end of the hall and to four sets of large brown heavy doors. Ireland was ahead, bursting into the doors, the sound ringing like a gunshot through the silence as the door slammed off the wall. </p><p>Every student turned simultaneously, their eyes wide until collectively, hesitantly, turning back to Dr. Vidal. A few students shrunk in their seats, while others gave them looks of pity. When Ireland finally turned towards the professor, her mouth opened– it snapped shut. Dr. Vidal was in the front of the hall, poised at the podium, mid-sentence– yet now her head snapped up, cocking to the side as dark brown eyes grew black with anger. Ireland’s stomach dropped, the realization slamming into her like a freight train. She just interrupted Dr. Vidal’s lecture… a woman who already hated her… a woman who thrived on natural order without interruptions– a woman who was now looking at her like she had announced she murdered her wife to her face.  </p><p>“And <em> what </em>,” she said, her voice dragging, “is the meaning of this?” </p><p>Her voice was so low– so low, like the first rumble of Smaug before he unleashed his fury upon the town of Dale. Ireland flinched, preparing for the flames, but Eva– her dear Bard the Bowman, stood fast. </p><p>“It’s your wife.” </p><p>And in a flash, Smaug no longer stood before them, but rather the protective, fierce, and loyal Meleys of a completely different realm, “What?” </p><p>“Your wife,” Ireland repeated, her voice rushing out in a single breath. “She’s in the quad– with her mother.” </p><p>Vidal moved, and within two blinks the lecture hall doors were slamming behind her, leaving the students in utter confusion. Eva and Ireland ran after her, jogging to even see her running figure ahead. They both pushed, watching their usual calm, collected professor sprint down the stairs– faster than they would give her credit for. They could barely keep up, losing sight of her as the three of them were skipping the stairs as they spun down them until Vidal tore through glass doors, running into the quad. </p><p>The girls didn’t think, they just followed watching in awe as Vidal only sprinted faster the moment she caught sight of her wife, having a full blown argument in the center of the quad. Students backed away from them, peeking out from corners, but refusing to make themselves known, nor step in and help as Ireland the Eva grew closer, just to hear Harkness’ mother–</p><p>“I ought to have killed you the moment you left my body, and I won’t allow another mistake like that to happen again.” </p><p>Something blinded Eva for a moment, a reflection– a ray from the sun hitting off something metal– something silver… and for a moment, the world froze. Eva’s eyes widened, her strides weak as she just reacted, unsure how she was going to get there faster, but Eva wasn’t needed. Vidal pushed through, a blur of black and green, cutting through the weight and severity– and she lunged.</p><p>When the pair hit the ground,there was a sickening crack, bones meeting ground, ribs bending and taking the force and weight. A scream tore through the air– someone– Eva couldn’t tell who– but then someone else gasped sharply. Sirens echoed in the distance, but they weren’t close enough– not with Harkness frozen. Her hands hovered uselessly over her stomach, eyes locked onto the tangled bodies before her. </p><p>There was a flash of silver and this time, the girls saw it clearly– a simple kitchen knife, meant to cut meat, was glimmering in the sunlight, shining in all of its glory in Evanora’s raised hand. It seemed to smile– a wicked smile as Evanora pulled her hand back, winding it back with her eyes locked on her daughter. </p><p>Vidal moved. </p><p>Not away. </p><p>Into it. </p><p>A hand reached out, grasping the older woman’s but in a flash, an agonized grunt echoed across the quad, over the sirens, and hitting the students. Before the old woman could move again Vidal somehow had the knife throwing it far away before her elbow slammed down onto the chest of the woman who dared to move again. This time, the crack was deeper, a crunch that rattled the students’ very bones as mouths fell open, others lurched, and few had actually stepped forward, in shock and admiration as the woman screamed out, clutching where Vidal had struck. </p><p>“Stay the <em> fuck </em> away from <em> my wife, </em>” the Dean spat in the old woman’s face, before backing off of her, her ass falling on the sidewalk as her balance was lost.</p><p>That’s when Ireland caught it, her gasp breaking the silence. A dark purple– a maroon stain was growing on Vidal’s green blouse, her body trembling from adrenaline. The dean looked down, her hand pressing against it as she winced before turning the palm to face her. Red stared back at her, greeting warmly as more students and professors filled the quad. </p><p>Police were running, an EMT team on their heels, but Ireland and Eva were only paying attention to the Dean’s wife. Dr. Harkness dropped to her knees with the grace of a non-pregnant woman, pulling her wife into her arms. Her hand immediately went to her side, applying pleasure to the wound as Vidal winced. </p><p>“You fucking idiot– what the <em> fuck </em> were you thinking?” Harkness’ eyes were glistening, her cheek rosy as tears kissed them. </p><p>Vidal let out a strained chuckle, “Wasn’t thinking, <em> mi vida.”  </em></p><p>Then her voice grew serious as she somehow managed to sit up, caressing her wife’s cheeks, thumbs brushing the tears away, “Did she hurt you? Did she put her hand–”</p><p>“I’m fine– our child is fine,” Harkness leaned into her touch, her eyes closing for a moment as more tears escaped. “But you’re not–”</p><p>“It’s just a flesh wound,” Vidal turned her voice to mock a British person, her voice nonchalant with a slight bit of defence. </p><p>“I <em> know, </em>you are not quoting Monty Python to me right now.” </p><p>The Dean laughed, but winced, clinging to her wife just as the EMTs pulled up beside them. Eva turned back to Ireland, finding William just approaching and freezing as two gurneies appeared,the cops on the strange woman who had threatened the Harkness-Vidals.</p><p>No one spoke. The student body remained frozen, professors watching with their mouths open as they were able to put Dr .Vidal onto a gurney, another EMT helping Dr. Harkness to her feet. William couldn’t keep his eyes off the pair, watching Vidal reach for her wife, Harkness snapping at another EMT as they were loaded into the truck. </p><p>He swallowed hard, “Did Vidal just jump in front of a blade for Harkness?” </p><p>Everyone nodded their heads slowly as other students began muttering, looking at each to confirm what they had just seen. </p><p>Ryan stood at the other end, his eyes wide as his bag fell off his shoulder, watching the officers take the crazy mother away as she screamed and cursed. But his gaze narrowed to the redhead watching the scene as well. He was in her class when they heard the older woman screaming and <em> all </em>of them, students and Dr. Maximoff came out to see what was going on. Ryan had watched the moment Dr. Harkenss’ mother pulled the knife, her gaze on the professor’s stomach. For a moment, he felt like a spector, watching everyone. He watched as students froze, others taking steps back in fear, and some even ready to move in, getting ready to sprint and stop what was about to happen.</p><p>Yet Ryan’s gaze ultimately fell on Dr. Maximoff, the way she froze, her eyebrows creasing in confusion. They were closer. They could have easily made it before any of the other students who were moving, but Dr. Maximoff hesitated. Her body flinched, unable to decide if she wanted to throw herself in or if the fear was too consuming. </p><p>For once… the obsession didn’t win. Dr. Maximoff hesitated too long. The moment she did move, a loud crack had echoed through the crowd, a pair of bodies slamming into the frozen earth. </p><p>Dr. Vidal did not hesitate. </p><p>There was no second guessing, no fear as the woman pulled a blade– no, she threw herself in front of it, blocking the path to her wife and unborn child. Ryan couldn’t help but feel his own heart flutter– their love was real. It was so fucking real– not some ‘kissy kissy’ show or some insane romantic shit you could only find on AO3. He gazed at them again, his heart clenching, fluttering, and pounding all at once– he felt like one of those <em> lesbihahns </em> gnawing at the metal bars of a cage, yearning for <em> that </em>type of love. </p><p>He turned back to Maximoff and she looked defeated, but for once that obsessive adoration wasn’t there, just a quiet understanding that was flashing across her features. Her obsession was strong, but nothing would ever be stronger than the love Dr. Vidal had for her wife. </p><p> </p><p align="center">

</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Pain scorched through her side as she blinked through the blinding lights of the ambulance. She knew it was serious, but she was right when she told her wife that it was a flesh wound, that nothing major was hit, but it still didn’t stop her from groaning like a little bitch as the EMTs started pumping her full of pain killers, or maybe that was the adrenalin. The only other thing she could focus on was a warm hand in hers, fingers brushing through her hair, caressing her face. The angelic voice was back– the exact same one she had heard when she woke up from anesthesia. Goddess above, she loved that voice. She turned her head towards it, feeling butterfly wings grazing her cheek, making her smile, and allowing herself to slip into darkness. </p><p>Rio wasn’t out for long, she snapped her eyes open hearing her wife’s angry voice, “I am <em> her wife </em> . I <em> have </em>to be with her!” </p><p>“Mrs. Harkness-Vidal, please, we just need a little bit of room. Once we have her stitched up, we will bring you right to her,” a doctor tried to reassure her wife. </p><p>A female voice came in next, a little softer but laced with firmness, “Let’s check on baby, shall we? It’s a lot of stress for both of you, but we can reassure you that your wife will be fine.” </p><p>And then Rio was rolled away, into a room where interns were on her immediately, cleaning and stitching up her wound. She felt dazed, her gaze on the door, watching patients be wheeled past, doctors running, nurses carrying charts, and a few random screams echoing through the hospital. She just nodded as the interns went through her blood work, doing the standard procedures until finally one of them addressed her for more than just the random check up questions. </p><p>“How far along is your wife, Mrs. Harkness-Vidal?” a nurse asked her, standing at the foot of her bed as she signed through the paper to get her checked out. </p><p>Rio smiled, “Twenty-four weeks. She is due in May.”</p><p>The nurse smiled warmly, “First little one?” </p><p>“Yeah, and he will be the first great-grandchild.” </p><p>“Ah, so he is extra special,” she nodded, as she set the chart down pulling up a chair beside her bed, but she didn’t sit, she simply leveled her with a look. “Alright, Mrs. Harkness-Vidal– Rio. Let’s talk about healing. The cut wasn’t deep, but it’s not great. Your tattoo isn’t perfect anymore and ribs move with every breath, so there will be discomfort and pain. You have six dissolvable stitches. But, you need to keep it clean and dry for seventy-two hours. No showers until tomorrow. No baths with the wife, no soaking. And you are off from work for the rest of the week. These first three days involve nothing but rest.” </p><p>“And lifting things?” Rio started, already thinking of the laundry she had been doing to stop her wife from walking the stairs. </p><p>She thought of the damn bunny, Señor Scratchy, her wife’s now-familiar– lifting him up from the floor when he or her wife wanted to cuddle. She thought of her garden, the mobile they had just ordered, even cooking– packing their lunches, putting groceries away. </p><p>The nurse gave her a knowing smile, “No lifting anything over ten pounds for two weeks. You can have sex after, but it is preferred to wait after four weeks– don’t give me that look. I can tell you’re a good wife, aside from jumping into a blade– and your wife adores you. I don’t think I ever heard somehow who could make these doctors cower until she opened her mouth. Anyway, no laundry, no grocery bags, if you still have nursery stuff– nothing. It’s your job to heal so you can be ready when your son is born.”</p><p>Rio nodded, guilt flashing her features for a moment. She didn’t exactly see the knife when she tackled Evanora. All she knew was that the woman threatened her wife… <em> again, </em>but this time raised her arm. She didn’t even know the knife was there until she felt it across her skin, ruining her favorite blouse. </p><p>The nurse continued, handing her a pamphlet for wound care, prescribing her Tylenol and telling her to watch for swelling or fever. The nurse finally left with the final word that her wife was finishing up fetal monitoring. She had relaxed back until a police officer walked in, his head bowed sheepishly, his hat off. Rio raised an eyebrow, trying to hide her panic. Fuck, she hated talking to the police and for a moment she wondered if all the times she got lucky when <em> she </em>started bar fights was about to catch up with her. </p><p>Before the officer could open his mouth, she spoke coldly, “Do I need my lawyer present, officer?” </p><p>He shook his head, “No, ma’am. No charges are being leveled against you.”</p><p>“And Evanora?” Rio’s gaze hardened, her jaw clenched as her mind went back to the shine of the blade, the rancor in Evanora’s gaze– the apathetic look in her eyes as she savored her wife’s fear. </p><p>The officer took a breath, fidgeting where he stood, “We did not realize the extent of her injuries. We had taken her straight to the station for violating the restraining order and attacking your wife and unborn child. When you slammed into her, you cracked a few false ribs on impact. What we assume from the struggle on the ground and disarming her, you shattered her sternum along with the fourth, fifth, and sixth ribs. There was internal bleeding.” </p><p>“And?” Rio arched an eyebrow.</p><p>“Evanora Harkness is dead.”</p><p>

</p><p> </p><p>Rio winced as Lilia and Alice led them into their own home, carrying their bags. Lilia already had made food for the week, refusing to take no for an answer and giving it to them. Alice had come with their bags and laptops from their offices, helping them take it inside. </p><p>Rio went straight for the couch, slowly easing herself down and closing her eyes. She hated this already, guilt consuming her being as she barely registered her wife and their friends talking in the kitchen. Rio wasn’t supposed to be the one resting. She was supposed to be the one taking care of her wife, easing her stress, her pains, and keeping her wife and unborn son healthy. She wasn’t supposed to be the patient.</p><p>Before she could move to get up, the couch dipped beside her, a hand caressing her cheek. She didn’t bother opening her eyes, leaning into the caress as if the touch could soothe the tidal of thoughts into gentle lapping waves. </p><p>“My love,” came the voice, velvet-dark and perfectly sweet. </p><p>The hand slid into her hair, brushing away the short pieces that framed her face and for a moment it was silent, her wife just studying her before lips were placed at the corner of her mouth. </p><p>“You’re not allowed to feel guilty,” her wife whispered, voice warm and welcoming as the first fire of Yule. “We wanted her dead for a long–”</p><p>“It’s not that,” she interrupted quietly. “Trust me, you know how much I have fantasized killing her. But, I should have seen the knife, and avoided it. I am supposed to take care of you– not the other way around.” </p><p>Her wife only gave her <em> that </em> look, the one that said ‘you are speaking such bullshit right now, but I love you. So I <em> will </em> listen and I <em> will </em> judge.’</p><p>So she continued, “I am supposed to protect you– make you comfortable as you carry our son. That was the plan.”<br/>Agatha rolled her eyes fondly, “You should know by now that life doesn’t conform to your plans. If it did, we wouldn’t be married, love. But you realize that you always protect me and today, my love, you protected not only me, but our son too.” </p><p>Rio sighed, the image of the blade being raised to throw at her wife flashing through her mind. She felt tears prick at the corner of her eyes as she took a deep shuddering breath only to wince from it. Her wife was there though, wiping her tears and holding her steady. Lips pressed to her cheeks continuously before she turned, capturing them with a simple tenderness between them. </p><p>A throat cleared, breaking them apart, “Lilia and I labelled your food for the first week. Agatha, you will be the one putting them in the microwave. Me or Lilia will be back to do the laundry, neither of you are to touch it. If you need help with the nursery, call us, also when did you guys get a fucking rabbit?” </p><p>Rio laughed at her best friend, before wincing again, muttering a curse. </p><p>“Long story, but she rescued him,” her wife hummed.  </p><p>Lilia nodded slowly, before turning sharply to Rio “Just don’t let him on the stitches. You tear those stitches, Vidal, and you won’t be holding your son right away. I’ll handle the next two days at the university and Jen will step in for your classes. Monday, when you return, you <em> will </em>have an assistant to run and make copies and what not. We will do damage control of the narrative.” </p><p>Rio nodded, “Thanks, Lilia.” </p><p>“When you are all healed, we are celebrating that cunt’s death,” Alice added, grabbing her coat. “To the Mother, I was so happy when you texted she was dead.” </p><p>Agatha sat up, a hand on her stomach, “We will celebrate once this one makes it through not tearing her stitches.”</p><p>She rolled her eyes at that, but felt herself fall further into the cushions, her eyelids heavy. She couldn’t stop the guilt from capturing her, and no, it was not over her mother-in-law’s death– part of it was regret, not being able to enjoy the moment she snuffed out the worthless life and not realizing how hard her elbow had landed. If she could go back, she would enjoy killing the cunt. But for now, she took the win that she was dead, the cops trying to sweep it under the rug that <em> they </em>messed up by not providing medical care immediately, and really, her and her wife couldn’t give two fucking shits. All she knew was that Evanora was dead. She couldn’t hurt her wife anymore and she would never get the chance to hurt their son. Their son would never know the cruelty from Evanora, nor the cruelty from her own sister. </p><p>A hand cupping her cheek made her jump awake, not realizing she drifted off into her own world, “Do you want lunch before you take a nap, my love?” </p><p>Rio shook her head, refusing to open her eyes as lips pressed to the spot in between her eyes, “Bed or couch?” </p><p>“Couch, I don’t wanna get up,” she replied groggily. </p><p>Her wife helped her slowly turn, laying her back on the couch before propping her neck up better and pulling the blanket down around her. She smiled as fingers ran through her hair, quickly soothing her. </p><p>“Before you fall asleep, my love. I need to show you something.” </p><p>Rio’s eyes snapped open at that, staring up into her wife’s eyes. They were shining down at her with restrained excitement, her gaze flashing towards the wound before her wife took her hand, bringing it up to her lips, kissing it softly. </p><p>“When I was in the quad, I was actually going to wait for you in your office,” she smiled softly before lowering her hand to the large curve of her stomach. “Someone wants to meet you, my love.”</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<b>Rio </b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Someone wants to meet you, my love.” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her breath caught as Agatha laid a gentle hand on the curve of her belly. Then came the soft press of her wife’s fingers atop her own, guiding, grounding. The silence was like a slow fog creeping over a valley. Rio didn’t dare breathe, too scared her breath would contrast with the life around her. Her eyes were wide, her body aching to rise– to pull her wife close. But she couldn’t risk the stitches, not when she needed to be healed and whole to hold their son when he was born. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They waited. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She swore the sweeper hand was morphing into the minute hand and then into the hour hand, everything practically screaming with impatience. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her brow furrowed, the confusion creasing her eyebrows painfully together. Her wife slid her hand, coaxing her to press lightly into her skin and another circle. Then–</span>
</p><p>
<span>She felt it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The faintest flutter beneath skin, a ripple of life, uncanny in its quiet power. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gasped and tried to sit up, but Agatha’s hand held her steady, firm against her chest. She froze. And then– another nudge, delicate and defiant– brushed against her palm. Tears streamed freely before she even knew she was crying. Her hand moved instinctively, searching, cradling, as her son danced against her wife’s skin– kicking, reaching, maybe trying to meet her hand from within– to press their palms together. Her heart thundered in her chest. The world narrowed to the sacred rhythm of movement and stillness, mother and son.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nothing else existed. Not the stitches, pulling with every breath. Not the rising tide of pain as the medicine ebbed. Not the death of her mother-in-law. Not the life she took with her own hands–</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh fucking well. </span>
</em>
<span>She’d do it </span>
<em>
<span>again</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And again </span>
</p><p>
<span>And again– as many times possibly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Without flinching. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Bitch had it coming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was no other feeling that could compare, even when she heard his heartbeat for the first time. Goddess, it was like when she first realized she fell in love with her wife, when she first kissed Agatha as her wife, the time Agatha showed her the positive pregnancy test– all in one but somehow not more profound. They were all such important, emotionally overwhelming moments, that she couldn’t possibly explain. There were no words in English or Spanish to put the name to how she felt– to how her heart was fluttering– to how happiness was consuming her– to how much she loved this woman who was carrying their child. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She felt herself start to tremble, her hand rubbing soothing circles as he continued to show off his strength. She swallowed hard, allowing the tears to slip from her eyes as the weight of everything crashed into her. Her son was alive, kicking her, greeting her– and…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>she could have lost both of them today. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio couldn’t stop the sob that bubbled up in her throat, tears pouring down her face. Evanora could have taken everything away from her in one swipe if it wasn’t for Eva and Ireland. Evanora could have killed her wife and her son if it wasn’t for her getting there in time– images of her wife bleeding out– stab wounds in her stomach like that one lady during the Red Wedding flashed through her mind. She felt like Caitlin Stark in that moment in her mind, on her knees begging Evanora to let them go– </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked out of the image, her free hand covering her face as the sobs pulled at her stitches, making her cry more. She winced, groaning, and choking on them as the sobs came heavy. Her wife was there though, leaning over her quickly, one hand rubbing circles on her chest over her heart, the other interlocking their fingers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, hey, easy, my love. Gentle breaths,” her wife soothed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio refused to remove her hand that covered her face, trying to ease her breathing as her wife pulled away for a moment. She didn’t question it when her wife stood, moving to the kitchen before coming back. The sobs hurt, pulling tightly at the stitches with each inhale. The couch dipped again and she only peeked when she heard the squeak of scissors cutting through the fabric of her chemise. She didn’t protest, knowing the blood already ruined it along with the large tear from the knife. Her wife simply cut straight up before cutting at the sleeves, Rio barely moving to help her take the thing off her. The scissors were set on the coffee table with a light ping before a hand was back on her chest, rubbing in slow circles between her breasts, right on her chest plate. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio slowly realised her wife was doing what </span>
<em>
<span>she</span>
</em>
<span> usually did to help her wife’s anxiety (when her wife didn’t want a hug or to be held), a grounding technique that stimulated the parasympathetic nervous system. The circles didn’t stop, a rhythmic pattern calming her racing heart, easing and slowing each breath she took. Rio didn’t remove her hand from her face as her breathing regulated, but then something warm and wet dropped on top of her hand, slowly rolling down her wrist. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She removed her hand then, looking up into tear-filled eyes and the sight broke her. She tried sitting up again, needing to pull her wife into her embrace– everything in her screaming to take care of her– to be the strong one of the two. But the hand on her chest, forced her down again, forcing her still as her wife raised an eyebrow. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Stop fucking moving</span>
</em>
<span>, </span>
<em>
<span>Rio Atropos Harkness-Vidal</span>
</em>
<span>,” her wife seethed through her teeth, tears still streaming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio froze, her eyes widening at the mention of her middle name. For whatever reason, her parents had decided to name her and her sisters’ middle names after the Moirai. Maria Klotho Vidal, Oriana Lachesis Vidal, and finally– in the cruel hand of irony– she was named after the eldest Fate and after the one who cut the thread of life… damn, she really was living up to that name after killing someone today.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When her wife would yell at her, it was always Rio Harkness-Vidal– and sure it was serious, but when Atropos– The Cutter of Threads– was used… it was only when Agatha was serious, furious, or trembling on the edge of losing herself to fear.</span>
</p><p>
<span> “To the mother, you’re going to fucking tear your stitches not even after a half-day of fucking having them.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her own tears betrayed her next. They slipped down in silence, caught in the hollow curve of her cheekbones, kissed the corners of her lips. Agatha– her Agatha– was radiant even when furious, especially when furious. The magic in her eyes wasn’t the kind that cracked open worlds. It was the kind that stitched broken things together. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine,” Rio whispered, even though they both knew it wasn’t true. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, you’re not,” Agatha snapped, voice hoarse, the hand on her chest trembling while the others that threaded their fingers together gripped tighter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, and the ceiling above them blurred. Agatha sniffled, dragging the back of her hand across her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You– you ran into someone wielding a knife– my mother holding a knife,” she choked. “You started bleeding out in the middle of the quad and now, you’re acting like you still have to be the unbreakable one.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I </span>
<em>
<span>am </span>
</em>
<span>the unbreakable one,” Rio replied softly, voice sanded down by emotion. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then why,” Agatha murmured, voice cracking, “did I feel the world start to come apart the moment the blood started to form a puddle on the sidewalk– when they separated me from you and told me if they weren’t there sooner– you would still be in the hospital from how much blood you lost.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand moved slowly, caressing the side of her stomach feeling her son press against her, anchoring her. Before she could respond, her wife let out a heavy sigh. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t always have to be my protector, my love,” her wife whispered. “You gave me a son, you almost gave me your life– it’s my turn to protect you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span> Rio stared at the love of her life– feeling herself falling in love all over again. Her heart thudded in her chest, fluttering at her words and chanting its own mantra : </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>She’s mine. She’s mine. She’s mine. She’s mine. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>(Lub-dub.) (Lub-dub.) ( Lub-dub</span>
</em>
<span>.) (</span>
<em>
<span>Lub-dub</span>
</em>
<span>.) </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, just once. A surrender and promise mixed all into one. Agatha exhaled shakily, her hand moving to where her heart was beating underneath, pausing for a moment, as if her heart’s mantra was the only thing keeping her wife together. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Still beating,” her voice was barely a croaked whisper. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And black,” Rio remembered the story as old as time between them, back to their college days when they were arguing over a piece of literature and Agatha had said her heart was black. “For you. Always for you.” </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio must have fallen asleep, maybe pulled under by the way her wife continued to rub her chest, easing her breathing or maybe when Agatha shoved her fingers down her throat to make sure she took her pain killers and basically waterboarded her. Rio hated pills, medicine, anything to deal with some science grade medicine– she may be a science professor, but her specialty was plants– the natural elixirs they produced– not whatever buck-fuck tiny ass pill that was through how many chemicals in a lab instead of something hand growned, picked, and ground up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Okay, so it was coming back to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her wife had gotten up in the pretenses of having to use the bathroom. Rio had closed her eyes, trying to act like every twitch wasn’t killing her. Then a hand was on her jaw, forcing it open before she could even process it. Fingers were shoved down her throat, causing her to gag, her stitches pulling slightly before a pill was placed in her mouth and a water bottle hovered her. Rio went to fight, to turn, to try to choke the pill back up, but the pain weakened her and so did the water that was now filling her mouth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She swallowed hard the moment the fingers left her mouth, her eyes watering as her wife stared down at her with a smug smirk. She had merely shrugged, not a word needed to know that Rio would not have taken them if it wasn’t shoved down her throat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Goddess, take a girl out before shoving your fingers down her throat.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife had only scoffed, patting her cheek condescendingly, “Don’t act like you didn’t like it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio was out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She groaned as she managed to sit up, blinking as she took in her surroundings. The house was plunged in darkness, the only light glowing from the kitchen. She could barely see what was in front of her as her hand reached for the table searching for a phone to check the time. She quickly found one, her eyes shutting as the screen scorched her face. Blinking through tears, she turned down the brightness and found her wife’s phone in her hand. She raised an eyebrow at her wife’s background. It was the selfie Rio had begged her to take with her– the one that Agatha had grumbled and refused until Rio was honest to goddess whining. It was the one lazy evening where they were cuddling in the window seat, Agatha reading to her and their son– well, really for her as it was </span>
<em>
<span>Hekate: Her Sacred Fires </span>
</em>
<span>by Sorita d’Este. Not exactly a book read to a baby. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wanted a picture of them together with Agatha’s baby bump and well, Rio wasn’t going to get it without a fight– but she won. Staring down at the lockscreen her heart soared, staring at their fingers interlocked on Agatha’s stomach, her back against Rio’s front, but their bodies turned so their lips could perfectly lock. Her wife told her that she didn’t care to have it in her phone, but seeing it now, she knew her wife went on her phone when she wasn’t looking and sent it to herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She shook out of her heart eyes, staring to find it was only six in the evening, enough time to plan and cook dinner. Rio stood, struggling slightly before turning on the lamp next to her. She froze. There, on the other side of the couch, was her wife, pillows tucked behind her back, under her belly, and between her knees as she slept– the almost finished baby blanket slowly falling to the floor, and something white and fluffy sitting on her chest. Rio shook her head, tonguing at her cheek to stop the smile as she turned on the lamp next to Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife didn’t even stir, the gentle rise and fall of her breathing moving the bunny with her. She reached down, her fingers grazing the white and light brown fur when it moved, faster than she could react. The nip was sharp, fleeting– and unfortunately, expected. Rio barely flinched back, watching Scratchy’s nose twitch at her as he was ready to thump at her, but pausing as if realizing he was still on her wife. Rio reached forward again, her hand pulling back in time as the bunny’s mouth opened. She was starting to regret ever introducing her wife to Scratchy. Rio tilted her head, trying her best to intimidate the rodent, but it merely twitched its ears before settling closer into her wife. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a small groan of frustration, before hissing at the thing, her teeth bared at him like a predator. Señor Scratchy flinched. A squeak left his mouth as he fell off her wife, behind her into the space between her and the couch. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>That</span>
</em>
<span> woke her wife.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Bright blue eyes snapped open, Agatha blinking up at Rio before her hand searched for the missing bunny on her chest. Then, Scratchy must have pressed against her back, because her wife huffed, rolling her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What did you do to him?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gasped, betrayal moving across her features, “What did </span>
<em>
<span>I </span>
</em>
<span>do to him? </span>
<em>
<span>He </span>
</em>
<span>bit </span>
<em>
<span>me.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s a baby, my love. So you’re telling me you’re going to bite our son </span>
<em>
<span>when </span>
</em>
<span>he bites you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The fuck you mean ‘when,’ our son wil be an angel unlike that demon,” Rio huffed back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled low and amused, “Babies teethe, love. They drool, slobber, pull at your hair and jewelry, and I have no doubt, as </span>
<em>
<span>your </span>
</em>
<span>son, he will bite.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why is he </span>
<em>
<span>my</span>
</em>
<span> son when he bothers you or you think he will do something, but </span>
<em>
<span>our</span>
</em>
<span> son when he is fine?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife just smirked at her, refusing to reply as she sat up, slowly, slapping Rio’s hands as she moved to help her, “You’re supposed to be resting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So are you,” she fired back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes but softened as the damn rodent jumped into her lap, pressing up against her stomach and purring lightly. It was Rio’s turn to roll her eyes as she stepped forward, going to lean down and kiss her lips, when a sharp pull stopped her, making her stand up straight. She turned away, knowing her wife was looking at her worried. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll order Chinese for tonight,” she muttered, grabbing her wife’s phone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b>***</b>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio knew healing wasn’t going to be easy, but she didn’t think it was be this fucking annoying. They ordered takeout that night and instead of falling into their normal position on the couch watching a movie– Agatha lying completely on top of Rio– Agatha moved their coffee table and triggered the footrests from the couch. They sat like that side by side, and worse, the fucking bunny had a problem with Rio running her hand on her wife’s stomach. He would push her away, nip at her when neither of them were looking, and kick his leg at her when Agatha’s attention was fully on the movie. </span>
<em>
<span>Little shit</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sleeping was somehow worse. Her wife refused to cuddle her, not wanting to hurt her and Rio couldn’t sleep on her side as well. Even when she wanted to pull her wife close, her wife was fast asleep, cocooned in the pregnancy pillow Rio had secretly bought a week ago– just in case. And now, she wished she hadn’t– so her wife would move in her sleep and cuddle her instead of acting like she was this fragile thing. But no, her wife was clinging to the U-shaped pillow, her face buried underneath the mess of hair, and snoring… loudly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife never snored when she laid on Rio… well, she told herself that, but that was because she was usually asleep before her. Rio had just laid there, staring up at the ceiling, listening to Scratchy, pawing at the bed for her to lift him up. She ignored him. If she couldn’t cuddle her wife, then he wasn’t getting the attention either. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Thursday consisted of her and her wife helping each other dress in lazy clothes. They moved slowly that day, Rio hating to admit, but she did want nothing more than to lie down– most specifically with her wife. She got part of her wish. They had gone to the couch, Rio’s head in her wife’s lap as she happily felt their son push against her hand. For those hours of sitting there while her wife read, Rio would like to say she was playing with her son, moving her hands on either side of her stomach, waiting to feel the kicks against her palm. To her surprise, her wife didn’t shrug her off, just allowed her to feel him until the movements slowed down and she guessed he fell asleep. She had kissed Agatha’s stomach, lying her head back down and closing her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She hummed, her breathing slow and she willed the pain to eb away and wished for sleep. Yeah, Rio apparently was asking for too much, because a soft chewing noise was filling her hearing. She felt herself twitch, sleep leaving her as annoyance filled her very being and when she turned her head to look off the couch, black beady eyes were staring into her soul as he chewed and licked at her hair. She snatched it back, finding it a matted mess as her wife chuckled above her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He was just grooming you, love,” her wife hummed, her own fingers running through Rio’s hair. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head, “No, he was being annoying while I was trying to sleep.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed softly, but moved Scratchy away from her, allowing her to drift off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Unfortunately, that wasn’t the last of Scratchy’s attempts, and by attempts– she actually thought he was trying to get her killed by her own wife. She swore the bunny fucking imprinted  on her wife. He was so in tune with her, always by her side, always nuzzling into her stomach– she hoped, if their son really was </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span> son… when he got the strength, that he would kick that stupid ass bunny someday soon. She didn’t understand it. He was constantly getting on her nerves, eating holes into her socks, hopping in front of her to trip her… Goddess, Rio actually thought her life was about to be ended the first few times it happened around her wife. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stood up slowly, her wife placing a hand on her arm to help balance her as she groaned. It was later in the day, her phone was already blowing with emails from work– the student newspaper, Pepper Stark, their friends, fuck– even Dr. Carvallo and Dr. Dylan was reaching out, but that was the least of her worries. Apparently, killing one of the world’s richest CEOs meant news outlets were on campus, they were filling both her and Agatha’s emails. At one point during the afternoon, someone had even knocked on their door. Rio was tempted to get up, but her wife held her down, both of them going quiet until the knocking stopped. For Agatha, her mother’s COO reached out asking if she would be taking over and without another word, Agatha signed over the company, refusing to even have a relationship with Harkness Inc, ever again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The money came next, despite the rancour and abuse her wife received from her mother, Evanora didn’t take her out of the will. Within the twenty-four hour timespan of her death… Well, Rio couldn’t believe the amount of zeros that landed in their bank account. Everything else on the will was on hold, from the houses to so many assets neither Rio nor Agatha bothered to remember– a lawyer stepped in, but agreed to wait until after their son was born and for Agatha to be on her feet. Nice lawyer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you want anything to eat, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>?” she asked as she slowly made her way to the kitchen, her hand over her side, her feet dragging. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, we will be eating dinner soon. I will get up in a second to throw it in the microwave!” her wife called out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stepped into the kitchen, reaching for her glass of water by the sink, before spinning in a circle, looking for her medication. She wasn’t going to have her wife shove her fingers back in her mouth… no matter how Rio </span>
<em>
<span>did </span>
</em>
<span>like it. Rio turned towards the center island, her eyes sweeping for the tiny white pill bottle before making her way down the hall towards their room. Just as she passed the living room, a white flash moved in front of her feet. Stumbling, Rio clutched her side, trying to avoid whatever it was until a loud squeak echoed into the stillness of the house. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She flinched, pain spidering up her side as she took a few deep breaths, but she should have kept moving when rushed footsteps made their way towards her. For a moment, she guessed her wife was checking in on her, but to her horror, her wife’s eyes were on the ground where Señor Scratchy laid on his side as if a bus had hit him instead of a light graze from Rio’s foot. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What did you do?” her wife reached forward, seeming to forget about the belly on her as she scooped the rabbit up in her arms, checking over his legs and sides. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked slowly, staring at the scene in front of her. Her mouth opened and closed, her eyebrows creasing as the rodent nuzzled into her wife, acting if he was trying to get away from her. The rodent chittered as Agatha soothed him, whispering softly to him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?” her wife snapped her gaze to hers, her blue eyes piercing angrily into her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She instinctively took a step back, before gesturing out her hand, “I didn’t do anything– I didn’t even touch him!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife tilted her head in the way that told her that she didn’t believe her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s lip curled, “He hopped in front of me, and he’s fine!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s a baby, Rio!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She groaned, running her hand down her face, “He’s a rodent. </span>
<em>
<span>I </span>
</em>
<span>am the one with stitches in my side.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife simply raised an eyebrow, but said something more, setting the rabbit down. He quickly hopped back into the living room as Agatha wrapped her arms around her neck. She melted into her wife’s embrace, her belly hitting her first. Rio smirked, a hand coming down to rub over the smooth bump. Her smirk softened as a limb pushed against her, making her wife slightly wince. Soothing over the kick with a careful hand, her lips pressed to her wife’s cheeks. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And how’s </span>
<em>
<span>our</span>
</em>
<span> baby doing, </span>
<em>
<span>mi vida</span>
</em>
<span>?” she asked softly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s fine, just super active and doesn’t know how to sit still like his </span>
<em>
<span>mami</span>
</em>
<span>,” her wife quipped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio only raised an eyebrow and before her wife could stop her, her tongue stretched out, licking up slowly against her cheek. The skin was smooth underneath, soft and tasting of lavender, something sweet, and something distinctly her wife. From the force of her tongue, the skin moved up slightly, but her wife didn’t pull away, no. She only sighed in defeat as the spit made her cheek gleam in the low lighting. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fifteen years, and one would think you would grow out of licking me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You knew what you signed up for, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>,” she countered. “And you like me licking you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife rolled her eyes, “Yes, my love. Your tongue is very talented. Now, go take your pills before I shove my fingers down your throat again– and don’t even start, Rio!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It had happened two more times, Rio barely catching herself on the final time, bracing herself against the wall. Her wife had only sighed, drawing the bunny into her arms. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You two need to get along,” her wife grumbled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eye twitched but she eventually said nothing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, the bunny and the Green Witch stared each other down before Rio broke away with a huff. </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was late when Rio’s phone rang. A loud trill waking them both up from their slumber on the couch. Rio sat up too quickly, her skin burning at the stretch as she was quick to lay back down, holding her side. She watched through blurred tears as her wife sat up, reaching for her phone, a hand absentmindedly on her belly as she moved. Rio blinked away the tears trying to appear fine as her wife answered the phone whilst getting up and walking over to her. A soft hand caressed her jaw, easing the pain softly– a minor distraction, a symbole of comfort. </span>
</p><p>
<span> “Hello?” her wife answered the phone, putting it on speaker. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, that you?” Pepper’s voice was shrill, slightly panicked but loud. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio winced, her eyes closing as she breathed heavily through her nose. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, yes. My wife is resting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Pepper hummed for a moment, seeming to contemplate whatever she was about to say. There was a deep breath in, as if Pepper was standing at the top of a cliff, about to dive into the unknown raging waters below. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hate to cut right to business,” she started slowly. “But I need one of you to come for a short time– I hate to ask either of you, but Agatha–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart rate spiked, her eyes darkening at the thought of either of them walking onto that campus where the flashing mob of hyenas lurked, ready to pounce with questions, students gawking at both of them, more whispered rumors among their colleagues. Her fists clenched and before her wife could respond, Rio was weakly sitting up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha narrowed her eyes to her, tilting her head with that unreadable expression.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, please– I need a statement from one of you. The students have been dodging reporters left and right, more conservative reporters are spinning the truth. I need, preferably your wife, to make a statement.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, absolutely not.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No! You’re six months pregnant and were almost stabbed. And now they’re reaching for a story that isn’t even there– to impeach into our lives when everything we have done is to keep our lives </span>
<em>
<span>ours</span>
</em>
<span>,” she argued back, but her body slumped as her wife laid her back down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife only hummed, realizing the roles were reversing. Rio was no longer calmed, collected, in control– no, she was frantic, grasping at the eroding edges, mud pulling into her own despair as she imagined her wife being surrounded by reporters. She could see Agatha panic, freezing as questions fired about her abusive mother– about her wife, about </span>
<em>
<span>Rio</span>
</em>
<span>, killing her mother– </span>
</p><p>
<span>Gods, Rio wanted to slam her head into something. How could she not see what eternal struggle her wife must be having? She killed her mother– Rio killed her mother, and sure, an abusive, homophobic cunt– there had to be something– some type of emotion, and yet, she hadn’t seen anything. Not relief. Not anger. Not happiness. Just concern for Rio. She didn’t know how to handle it– she didn’t know how to handle the fact that </span>
<em>
<span>fuck</span>
</em>
<span>, she killed someone.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Would Agatha trust me around our child? What if she thinks that I’m heartless? What if she doesn’t see it as protection– I just wanted to protect. I just wanted to keep her safe. I–</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Lips pressed against hers, soft and sweet, ceasing her spiralling thoughts in her tracks. It was slow, petals pressing against her lips before it deepened, the flower blossoming– a teasing tongue moving into her mouth before pulling away all together. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pepper, we will call you back later and give you an answer around eight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>With that she hung up, turning to cradle her face in her hands. Rio melted, leaning into the safety. She didn’t know why the simple gesture always made her feel like Agatha was wrapping her in eternal protection. Her gaze was soft and understanding, thumbs wiping tears away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You need a nap, my love,” she spoke softly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio scoffed, “I’ve been sleeping all day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Silence filled the room, but it wasn’t unbearable. It was a moment to build up their strength, to breathe in an air of calm before diving into what both of them knew would be an argument. Rio turned her face slightly, kissing the palm of her wife’s hand as she rubbed her stomach, feeling a sharp kick against her palm. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You woke him up,” Agatha muttered, but there wasn’t any malice, just a quiet understanding of the comfort it brought Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t want you going in tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled darkly, “Well, you’re still on bed rest, so it has to be me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head at her wife, subtly telling her to drop the bullshit. Agatha sighed, helping her sit up so they could talk. Fingers ran through her hair, trucking the stay pieces away from her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What has you so worried, my love?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s mouth opened, her hand back on her wife’s baby bump.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And don’t say the baby,” she cut her off, a knowing glint flashing in those ocean eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, I killed your mother.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife tilted her head, chuckling lightly, “Yes, you did. Once you’re all healed up, I plan to thank you properly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her voice dropped lowly, a hand moving up her thigh. Rio sighed, naming it easily : deflection. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife groaned, looking the other way, “Must we do this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You can’t fuck your way out of this one, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>,” she hummed, brining a small chuckle to her wife’s lips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife breathed in, her eyes closing as her hand came to the side of her stomach, comforting their son who must be tossing and turning within her. Rio placed a hand along with her, not in an attempt to rush her, but just to let her know she would wait– she would sit for as long as Agatha needed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She chewed her cheek nervously when tears started to pool in the corners, eyelids opening to reveal eyes as crystal blue as any glacier, “What does it make me if I am so happy, so relieved that she is dead?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And what does it make me if I am the one who killed her?” Rio asked just as quietly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A weak smile pulled at the corner of Agatha’s lips, “Lucky.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A saint.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head, shaking it slightly bewildered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My hero.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A beat of silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“His hero.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath caught. Her gaze snapped to her wife–  who couldn’t meet it, who stared instead at the gentle swell beneath her sweatshirt. And just then, as if stirred by the words or by fate itself, a limb pressed outward, distorting the smooth curve of Agatha’s belly. She traced it with her fingers, feather light touch, one that would tickle, watching it flinch away from her touch. A soft, startled laugh escaped her– then stilled. Her eyes drifted into memory, into mourning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She leaned back against the couch, her head tilting toward the ceiling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She had a knife,” she said. “And her eyes were locked on my stomach.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s entire body tensed. Whatever guilt had been stirring in her was gone in an instant, evaporated like fog under flame. She would do it again. A thousand times again. Agatha turned then, cupped her wife’s face with a hand that had always held love and war in equal parts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And just like all the times before– long before you even knew– you were there. Saving me. Shielding me. Yes, my mother is dead” a  breath “thank the goddess for that. But you?” Her thumb brushed Rio’s cheek. “You’re no killer, my love. Technically…” she added, with a hint of dry irony, “the police let her die when they didn’t act fast enough.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s voice was barely a thread, unraveling, “I still snapped her ribs.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then Agatha whispered, her voice a ghost of old bruises and buried screams, “And she shattered so many of mine long before you ever laid a hand on her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio froze as her wife pulled away from her face, her legs curling underneath herself as her hands went back to their son, soothing him beneath the skin. But Rio couldn’t react. She was shocked, her body rigid as her wife’s words spun continuously around her head, pinging off her meninges and cerebrum. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife didn’t really talk of her past, but she knew well enough how some days her wife tensed when someone snuck up behind her, when a cabinet was slammed too loudly, or how she froze when people started screaming. She would hide her panic around her brilliance in sarcasm, quick retorts that sounded as if they had been rehearsed but in reality, her wife was always good at insulting someone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She knew Evanora hurt her wife, knew she was homophobic, but never realized how deeply her wife’s scars were, and in that moment, her own scar formed, a painful lingering thing– a deep reminder that she couldn’t have done anything to stop it, that she didn’t have the power of cosmos to go back in time and kill Evanora before she even had a chance to hurt her wife. All she could do was be here for her now. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a deep breath, knowing not to push. It was rare for her wife to open up about anything in her past and she learned quickly that asking questions drove her further away. Instead, she laced her fingers with her wife’s over their son, unable to pull her in or lean down and kiss her belly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I would burn the entire world for you, </span>
<em>
<span>mi vida,</span>
</em>
<span>” she whispered softly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a moment of silence between them as she caught sight of a brief smile, but she knew better than to expect a loving or poetic answer in return. </span>
<em>
<span>Those </span>
</em>
<span>were the really rare moments, like Rio telling her stories underneath the stars, sometimes moments after making love, or if they got into a fight and were making up. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>This </span>
</em>
<span>was way too raw, way too </span>
<em>
<span>close</span>
</em>
<span> to that certain thread she knew Agatha was too scared to pull all at once, even for her. </span>
<em>
<span>This </span>
</em>
<span>was where Agatha’s armour held tight, even when her soul was peeking through. </span>
</p><p>
<span>So, she braced herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Gods, Rio,” she shook her head, trying to hide the blush in her cheeks. “You’re so pathetic.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio inevitably lost the fight of Agatha going to the school to make a statement. She wasn’t going to teach. Just an hour meeting before giving a statement to get the news reporters away from the university. But that didn’t mean Rio was going to let her go alone. No, she texted the coven separately, telling them to stand by her wife, asking for them to intervene if necessary. Lilia would be the closest as she was the temporary Dean while Rio was out and already taking over her duties for next semester. But it didn’t stop the nerves from eating at her. She didn’t know how many people knew of Evanora’s death, but she was for certain the whole business world did and it scared her to think what ties they had with the cunt. </span>
</p><p>
<span>So Rio didn’t sleep that night again. She laid on her back, staring up at the ceiling, listening to Scratchy thump at her from the floor and the soft snores from her wife beside her. She got up around four in the morning, not able to stand being so useless. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She went to their bathroom, cleaning the wound and staring at the stitches. They weren’t kidding, unfortunately saying the blade messed up her tattoo. The scar would be hideous on her tattooed bones, distorting the perfection and forever imprinting the memory of what she had done to protect her unborn son and her wife. She grumbled, quietly heading into the kitchen and grabbing the misting bottle for her plants. She moved around the ivies, refilling the tiny bottle continuously, but she couldn’t lift her watering can for the other plants. She moved to the palm tree in the dining room, knowing she would have to move it to the greenhouse soon. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she turned to the monstera by the reading nook, she froze. Soil was everywhere, the leaves shredded but luckily not eaten. Monstera was toxic to bunnies, and she had been nervous to leave Scratchy out of his cage but animals were smart– Señor Scratchy was too smart apparently as her heart cracked as she stared at the exposed mangled roots. They were chewed up and spit out. Her beautiful white and green leaves were already browning around the edges. She turned back to the floor, finding bunny sized paw prints leading underneath the dining table in circles as he seemed to kick off the dirt before going to his pen where she knew the bastard was sleeping soundly without a care in the world. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She would have to wait to run the sweeper, but she didn’t even think she could with the stitches. She didn’t want her wife cleaning this up either as tears pricked at her eyes. The monstera was so expensive, a plant she didn’t think she could have or wisely buy even with her and Agatha’s salaries. Her wife wouldn’t be happy if Rio bought it but everytime they were in a plant store together, Rio would always freeze when passing by a monstera, caressing the large leaves in hopes of one day it would be a sensible purchase. But her wife had been watching and the day she became Dean of faculty, she came home to find the plant sitting on their kitchen counter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She froze, caressing the tiny leaves in shock before arms wrapped around her waist, kisses being pressed to the back of her neck. Next thing Rio knew, she was holding onto the counter her other arm around her wife’s neck, relying on Agatha to hold her up as fingers thrusted roughly inside her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But that plant meant everything to her. It was the fact that her wife saw her– </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> saw her. She noticed Rio hesitating about buying the plant and did it herself. And now, dirt ruined their hardwood floors, the plant in pieces scattered around. Gods, as if they didn’t have enough going on. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio moved slowly, allowing the tears to run down her cheeks as she used the arm on the side that wasn’t cut, weakly sweeping the dirt and leaves into a pile with a broom before petting her monstera softly, whispering apologies for bringing the rodent into their sanctuary. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A thump made her grow stiff. She turned slowly, finding the culprit twitching its nose at her before hopping away down the hall to where her wife lay sleeping. She couldn’t find the strength to pick up the dirt, but it was out of the way to pick up later. She wiped the tears away, moving on to the rest of her plants through the house before moving to the living room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio wanted to scream. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The lab report she assigned… the reports she was about to grade… the hand written reports she forced the students to do… were all in pieces scattered across the living room floor. They sat in wet little piles, rabbit teeth marks signs of complete obliteration. Not a paper was left intact. Never in all of her years had she had something like this happen. She was known for slapping down graded reports almost immediately, enjoying the silent tears down some students’ faces. And now, her reputation was ruined by a fucking rodent with floppy ears and a fluffy tail. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She slowly lowered herself to the floor, grunting in pain as she gathered the paper, throwing the pieces into a pile on the coffee table, where they originally were to be dealt with later. She had to worry about her wife first. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It took too long to stand for Rio’s comfort. She stumbled, her side pulling as white hot pain flared, but nothing tore. That’s what mattered anyway. She couldn’t tear them. All of this was for her son. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She got to work in the kitchen, pulling out her wife’s snacks, the ones she could reach without pain and the ones that weren’t heavy. A panic gasped made her turn too sharply, her feet sprinting back to their room before she could even react to the pain. Her wife was sitting up in bed, frantically looking around before immediately relaxing once blues set their sights on her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Mi amor?</span>
</em>
<span>” she questioned softly, approaching her quickly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat on her side of the bed, getting her wife to lay back down on the pillow, her hand smoothing over her wife’s belly. Nothing kicked at her hand, their little one still asleep. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s wrong, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>?” she whispered, trying to ease her wife back into sleep. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grabbed her hand tightly, refusing to let go as her eyes fluttered closed, “You weren’t here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt herself sigh softly, moving her hand to lace their fingers together over their son. She held herself back from leaning down and kissing her lips, instead lifting her other hand, moving tangles of chestnut away from her wife’s face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll always be here for you and our son,” she promised. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t even crack an eye open, “Then why weren’t you in bed for the last three hours?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked over at the digital clock, glowing dimly– 7:03 AM. Her heart quickened. Her wife was leaving at 10:30. The hours felt too thin, like paper drenched in ink, crumpling under the weight of what was to come.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just thinking and cleaning up the fact that your rabbit ate my students’ lab reports.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Blue eyes shot open at that, “He </span>
<em>
<span>what</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Paper was everywhere. I told–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t even get through the sentence before the laugh came- small at first, then rolling, then full. That rare, bright kind of laugh that turned into soft snorts when Agatha really let go. Rio froze like she always did when Agatha laughed like that, watching her with awe, letting the sound wrap around her like warmth. And no, she decided firmly– she would not ruin that music with the truth about the monstera. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re telling me,” Agatha snorted between giggles, “that Dean Vidal has to go in on Monday and explain that a </span>
<em>
<span>rabbit</span>
</em>
<span> ate the lab reports?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll blame you and your pregnancy brain,” Rio deadpanned, slowly leaning back against the pillow behind her and groaning slightly as her skin pulled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha simply pushed herself up on her elbow, one brow arching with sharp suspicion, “You dare, and I’ll tell the board you fabricated your entire dissertation.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t even know where my dissertation is.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do. Bottom drawer. Labeled ‘For when Rio Thinks her Dick is Bigger than Mine.’” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffed at her, “You sure about that?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked, sinking into her maternity pillow like a queen atop of a throne of smugness. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Check the sex drawer, </span>
<em>
<span>dear,” </span>
</em>
<span>she sneered. “I can guarantee you I purposely bought mine to be bigger than yours. Plus, you’re a size-queen when you’re a brat.” </span>
<em>
<span> </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked down, holding back from chuckling as her tongue poked at her cheek. Her wife had her there. But her mind drifted to her precious monstera and the amusement fell.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She muttered under her breath, “I still hate that bunny.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>That got Agatha’s attention, “You what?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hate him, Agatha.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned forward, careful not to jostle her side too much, her voice rising in exasperation, “He chews everything. He’s eaten three pairs of my socks. He peed in my shoes. He has bitten enough and not to mention last night he tried to trip me– not once but three fucking times. And now, he destroyed my students’ reports. That was vengeance. That was premeditated.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s teething,” Agatha said calmly, a hand rubbing over her belly as if a rodent could be equivalent to their child. “And he’s a prey animal. He senses your loathing.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because he earned it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s traumatized.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gaped at her, “From what? Sleeping as if he pays the bills? The free roam he is allowed? His whole entire bunny kingdom in our dining room?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips twitched, but she didn’t break, “He’s sensitive. Like me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, hell no,” Rio hissed, pressing a hand to her side as she sat up straighter. “Do not compare yourself to that fluffy demon. You don’t chew drywall.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged, far too at ease, “You haven’t seen me in a third-trimester rage.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t tempt me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>A soft quiet fell between them then, the absurdity of their conversation wrapping around them like a familiar quilt. Rio leaned her head back, the ache in her side reminding her of her limits. She reached out again, her fingers brushing Agatha’s hand, which was still resting over the slow swell of their son. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t trust him near the baby.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked, the tiniest pause, “He’s a rabbit, Rio. Not a dog or a cat.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’d trust a dog or a cat over him,” she quipped back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s a baby too–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat up, pretending like it didn’t hurt, “Why are you defending him? He destroyed my monstera– the monstera </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> bought me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife stared at her, not saying a word as her eyes were wide with surprise. She sat up slowly on the pillow as Rio blinked and then she realized she was crying. Her vision was blurry, hot tears running down her cheeks. Her wife moved slowly, easing her back down in the bed and kissing her lips softly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s okay–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not!” Rio protested, but Agatha was cradling her face, already calming her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is, my love. I’ll clean it up and we will look into getting three more of them if you would like.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She groaned, more tears running down her face, “With what money?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife tilted her head, and it hit Rio. Right. Evanora Harkness and the amount of zeros now at the end of their shared account. Thumbs caressed her cheeks again, wiping away the tears as her wife was careful not to lean on her, even with her belly.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn’t sleep last night, my love,” her wife didn’t even bother forming it as a question. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head though in agreement, “How could I when I can’t even hold you?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife sighed, “I’m right here, Rio. Rest. I’ll wake you before I leave and then you will stay in bed the rest of day.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She nodded weakly, feeling the hands leave her face. Agatha moved, angling so her body was horizontal and so her belly wouldn’t be resting on Rio. Instead, her head was resting atop of Rio’s breast, easing her aching heart only slightly.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stirred from her slumber, the softness against her lips drawing her from the haze of sleep. A smile tugged at her lips as she let her hand wander gently across the curve of her wife’s cheek, holding her there, savoring the connection. Their lips parted briefly, just enough for a shared breath, before they were drawn together again, the kiss slow and tender, unraveling the last traces of drowsiness in Rio’s body. Her heart fluttered, each beat echoing the rhythm of her overwhelming love for her wife and the little life growing within her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha finally pulled away, Rio’s eyes shot open, her breath caught in her throat. She went to sit up quickly, but the movement was halted by a wince, and she eased herself into a more deliberate motion, taking in the radiant vision before her. Agatha stood there, a painting in a dark purple overall dress that hung loosely around her frame, allowing her to breathe. The fabric molded comfortably around her swollen belly, and beneath it, a soft white sweater hugged her arms, the Triple Goddess pendant resting against her chest like a sacred token. And then, the emerald wedding band, glinting on her finger, a finger that finally lost its swelling. </span>
</p><p>
<span>With a careful motion, Rio swung her legs over the edge of the bed, her hands instinctively reaching for Agatha’s hips, drawing her closer. The smile that spread across her face was almost painful in its intensity as her palms gently brushed against the curve of Agatha’s belly, feeling their son shift beneath her touch. Her heart soared as the baby greeted her with a little nudge against her hand. Agatha chuckled softly at the look of awe on her wife’s face, the tenderness in her gaze making Rio’s heart swell. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You really are obsessed with me, aren’t you?” Agatha hummed, her voice laced with affectionate amusement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded her head, whispering in soft Spanish to their son who happily pushed back against her cheek the moment she rested her head there. Fingers smoothed out her sleep tousled hair as Rio kissed her stomach more before standing up. Agatha smiled brightly into her as her lips happily caught hers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are radiant, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor,</span>
</em>
<span>” she whispered, before singing softly. “</span>
<em>
<span>Mi hermosa, mi cielito, mi sol, mi corazón, mi alma– la madre de mijo.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife laughed softly, both of them imagining Rio spinning her around if she had the strength to because– </span>
<em>
<span>Gods, </span>
</em>
<span>she really would do anything for her wife. Anything to make her smile, to make her wife laugh– to make her realize how beautiful she is and especially radiant carrying their son.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re going to make me late, love,” her wife tried to pull away, but Rio pressed her lips to hers again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She moved her lips up to her ear and whispered, “</span>
<em>
<span>Dioses</span>
</em>
<span>, the things I want to do to you, </span>
<em>
<span>cariño.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife pushed her away, </span>
<em>
<span>gently</span>
</em>
<span>, tutting at her, “Nope, nope. Two weeks, Rio, and we can fuck to your heart’s content but for now, you don’t even get to tease me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tongue pushed against the side of her cheek, still refusing to release her, “So, just in time for my birthday?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife’s smirk was vicious, “Yes, my love, but unfortunately, not in time for Valentine’s Day. So, be good and don’t tear your stitches, so I can fuck my </span>
<em>
<span>older </span>
</em>
<span>woman properly to make up for that loss time and to celebrate you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head, “Agatha, I am only tens months older than you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Still old, love. And now look at you, a milf.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She barked out a laugh before her hand went to her own side, holding over her stitches, “If anything that title belongs to you, </span>
<em>
<span>cariño.</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“For you only,” her wife nodded, kissing her lips softly before pulling away. “Walk me out?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio followed her wife through the house, finding the monstera picked up, and in the living room, she caught a glimpse of the coffee table, where all of their papers were missing from it. She helped her wife with her coat before peering outside and finding the street empty. Good. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Text me as soon as you are done, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor. </span>
</em>
<span>And if you get uncomfortable with a question, Lilia will be right there. And–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>A hand was placed on her chest, “Breathe, Rio. It’s a little meeting and a quick Q&amp;A. If anything, Pepper and Lilia already have a statement drafted. I’ll be home in at most four hours.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio did not breathe. She only stared at her wife unimpressed with a slight pout to her lips that her wife tried kissing away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Four hours, and then I’ll be home and we can play whatever you want– Minecraft, those Italian brothers, or the last of whatever– that one weird fungi zombie game.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She lit up at that, kissing her wife again quickly before opening the door for her, handing her purse.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And Rio,” her wife turned the moment she stepped on the porch. “Please, don’t do something that tears your stitches.” </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">
<b>***</b>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Don’t tear her stitches. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Easy. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Or so she thought. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The moment she watched Agatha’s car leave the driveway, Rio found herself pacing. What the fuck was she supposed to do? She couldn’t sit down. She was too scared to try to start cleaning anything or helping around the house. She couldn’t risk it. So, for the first hour, she had paced in the living room, ignoring angry black beady eyes staring at her. She ignored his thumps, his demand for attention. He was a rodent. He was fine. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then came the sound of chewing, of paper tearing. She stormed into the dining room, finding Scratchy had somehow opened one of her old science books from her days at Salemite’s. She sighed, dragging the heavy book from the shelf and into the center of the floor. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If I let you chew this, </span>
<em>
<span>Señor, </span>
</em>
<span>can we call it a truce?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The caramel spotted bunny ripped another page, chewing on it and letting the pieces fall to the floor. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good enough, </span>
<em>
<span>Señor</span>
</em>
<span>,” she sighed, turning towards the basement. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The plan was simple. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Four hours at most.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Do something that wouldn’t jostle her. Something where she wouldn’t be tempted to move too much. So </span>
<em>
<span>Dead by Daylight </span>
</em>
<span>was out, so was </span>
<em>
<span>Red Redemption. </span>
</em>
<span>She could play </span>
<em>
<span>Hogwarts Legacy, </span>
</em>
<span>but she also got too upset when she reached the spiders and had to fight them. The babies didn’t deserve it, and she knew she would end up moving wrong. </span>
<em>
<span>Resident Evil </span>
</em>
<span>was definitely out and so was </span>
<em>
<span>Assassin’s Creed. </span>
</em>
<span>So </span>
<em>
<span>The Sims</span>
</em>
<span> it was. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She stepped down slowly, exhaling into the cool air. She went straight to the worn couch draped in old green blankets and in front of her was the tv where her PlayStation sat like a faithful dog beneath the screen. She lowered herself slowly, each movement precise, controlled. Her stitches ached, but dull. Bearable. She set the controller beside her, reached for a pillow to tuck beneath her side, and carefully reclined. The moment her back met the cushions, she felt the tiniest bit relaxed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She set her music up on her phone, turning on </span>
<em>
<span>Unloved</span>
</em>
<span> as </span>
<em>
<span>The Sims </span>
</em>
<span>logo flickered onto the screen. Rio smirked, knowing she was about to make something so dumb and beautiful. She started from scratch. The first Sim was a tall blonde, sharp features, and shoulder length hair. The blue suit was up next before giving her sim the perfect characteristics: “hot headed, psychotic, romantic but selfish.” Villanelle. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Next came the soon-to-be-lover. She had crazy dark curls, permanently inquisitive eyebrows, and a trench coat. She made her a genius, a perfectionist, and made her a secret agent. Eve. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, just to add a bit of fun, she dropped them in a suburban home with </span>
<em>
<span>one </span>
</em>
<span>bed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now,” she grinned to herself, tapping her finger against her lips, “let the longing begin.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She set them to “enemies with chemistry.” Their first interaction was a flirty introduction. The screen flashed red hearts and furious speech bubbles in tandem. Eve slapped Villanelle. Villanelle flirted back. She also cooked ramen and set the stove on fire. She smirked to herself, remembering when Hela did that to her ramen in the microwave in college. </span>
</p><p>
<span>While their digital lives unfolded, she decorated their house. She added a large garden, a shit ton of books, something suspiciously hers and Agatha’s aesthetic. Except in this land, she could put a knife display in the kitchen, line the fireplace with human skulls, and ominous weapons littered the house. She puppeteered their lives as if she were a fanfic writer, controlling each and every moment, every tension filled scene, leading them closer and closer to romance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Time started to slip. She didn’t even realize how long she had been sitting there, escaping her stress for her wife as the music even trickled on. First, she barely reacted, hearing a few thumps of a certain creature making his way down the stairs. In her mind, Scratchy was still having fun with her book. It was a giant biology book on plants that she hardly touched since university. She didn’t think he would make his way downstairs to see what she was up to. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, she heard it. </span>
<em>
<span>Thump</span>
</em>
<span>. A blur of caramel and white fur shot across the floor, straight towards her. She didn’t have a chance to move before the bunny jumped up, barely making it on her and that was the problem. Señor Scratchy jumped right on her stitches and white hot searing pain ripped through Rio. She dropped the controller as Señor Scratchy slipped from her side, to the couch, and onto the floor with a dull thud before he bounded away like nothing happened.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At first, she couldn’t move. The pain bloomed so suddenly, so violently, that it stole the air from her lungs. Her hand clutched her side, her breath caught in her throat as her other hand scrabbled at the cushion beside her, searching for purchase, grounding, anything. She blinked rapidly, her vision swimming, her body locking in place as the sting evolved into something sharper– wet, burning, wrong. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Blood. Her fingers came away red. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shit– shit– </span>
<em>
<span>carajo</span>
</em>
<span>,” she hissed, folding forward slightly but quickly straightening when the movement nearly dropped her to the floor. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her pulse roared in her ears. She looked down and saw it. It was a little bit of blood, nothing to make her woozy or something too serious. If anything the bunny just pulled at the stitches and irritated her skin or maybe snapped a single stitch. She would be fine, but panic was creeping up her spine. </span>
</p><p>
<span>This couldn’t be happening. If she didn’t heal, she wouldn’t be able to hold him, </span>
<em>
<span>I won’t be able to hold my son. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio forced herself up, teeth clenched as she powered through. She made it to the steps, keeping the pressure on her side as she slowly climbed the stairs, scared to risk truly tearing something or causing more damage. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Calling her wife was out of the question. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Please don’t do something that tears your stitches, </span>
</em>
<span>her last words before she left. </span>
<em>
<span> </span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>In her defense, she wasn’t doing anything but making a digital serial killer and digital MI6 agent fall in love. Gods forbid a woman had hobbies. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was the bunny, but he didn’t mean it. He had no conception of what was going on. Just that Agatha was the one that loved him most and Rio was extra human there. But she couldn’t worry her wife. She could just get to a clinic. Get it stitched again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Easy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Clean. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Quick. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She made it to the top of the stairs, finding her slides in the hallway that led to the front door, and just as she grabbed her keys there was an unmistakable sound of a metallic click. Rio’s heart stopped as her body refused to move. She figured she could just turn away, slip out the back maybe, text her she went for a drive. But Rio didn’t have her phone. It was still in the basement where </span>
<em>
<span>The Sims </span>
</em>
<span>were probably making out by now and her truck was parked next to Agatha’s in the driveway. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The door creaked announcing judgment day and the slam was the final toll of death. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped through the doorway, her presence unmistakable– heavy, electric, already tense. She had barely crossed the threshold when her eyes locked on the scene before her. Shoes half-on. Car keys clenched. A widening patch of red blooming through gray fabric at her wife’s side. Her whole body stopped. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you fucking kidding me?” the words sliced through the quiet like a blade. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio flinched, instinctively straightening even though the movement wrenched her wound and made her wince. Her body screamed but it was nothing compared to the blaze in Agatha’s voice. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I said four hours. </span>
<em>
<span>Four</span>
</em>
<span>. And you couldn’t sit still for those goddamn hours?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio opened her mouth to speak, to explain, to plead– but Agatha was already moving. Not with tenderness. With precision. With fury. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re bleeding,” she hissed, eyes narrowing as she stalked forward, each boot clicking like a gun cocking. “You’re fucking </span>
<em>
<span>bleeding</span>
</em>
<span> and I can see it from the door. What the hell happened?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was just the rabbit–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> it now?” Agatha cut her off. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her arms folded across her chest, one hand resting protectively over the curve of her belly. Rage radiated off her, but beneath it– panic, raw and desperate. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m </span>
<em>
<span>sure </span>
</em>
<span>it was the fucking bunny. Or was it the greenhouse this time? Or the bookshelf in the nursery that I told you to fucking wait on? Always some shit you ‘just had to do.’ Gods forbid you fucking </span>
<em>
<span>rest </span>
</em>
<span>and let someone else take care of you!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>No,” </span>
</em>
<span>her voice trembled. “You always have to prove how strong you are, don’t you! As if jumping in front of a knife, wasn’t enough! As if me standing in front of a group of journalists telling how you saved mine and our son’s lives, wasn’t enough! Do you even–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She faltered– then pushed the words out like they were poison in her mouth, “</span>
<em>
<span>Do you even fucking care to hold him, Rio?</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Silence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Earth wasn’t rotating. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Oxygen didn’t work.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The air was nothing but carbon monoxide. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And something in Rio snapped…</span>
</p><p>
<span>perhaps a heartstring. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was mean– she had a beautiful snark and vicious streak– her mean wife to her gold retriever wife. It was one of the many reasons she fell in love with the woman. But never had it ever been used on her like this. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You– you– that’s not fair, Agatha, and you know it,” her voice cracked as she refused to allow the tears to run that gathered in the corners of her eyes.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>This was where Agatha expected her to fight back. To yell at her that she didn’t mean that– for Rio to scream how everything she had been doing had not been for herself, but for her loves. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Because if anyone knew Rio, it was Agatha. She </span>
<em>
<span>knew</span>
</em>
<span> how Rio didn’t love lightly– how once she gave her heart, it was to the bone. How she threw herself into love with a kind of terrifying surrender, a devotion so absolute it didn’t matter if it burned her. Agatha had seen it. Felt it. Built her world around it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She </span>
<em>
<span>knew</span>
</em>
<span> Rio would do anything for her. Which is why it broke something deep and primal when Rio didn’t fight. Didn’t yell. She just stood there– silent– as the tears began to fall. Not from physical pain. Not from fear. But from heartbreak. Because Agatha hadn’t just struck a nerve– she had torn out the black thing. And instead of holding it, trembling and sorry, she had crushed it beneath her heel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at her, and Rio saw the surprise and regret blooming too late in sea blue irises, “Rio–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned, grabbing her keys with blood still darkening the side of her hoodie. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where the fuck are you going?” Agatha demanded, panic crawling into her voice now. </span>
</p><p><span>“To breathe,” Rio bit out as she walked around her wife. “To not say something I can’t take back. </span><em><span>Because</span></em> <em><span>you</span></em> <em><span>already</span></em> <em><span>did</span></em><span>.” </span></p><p>
<span>Rio slammed the door behind her, tears falling freely from her eyes as she flew to her truck. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And when she blinked again, she was pulling into the emergency section of the hospital… </span>
</p><p>
<span>still crying… </span>
</p><p>
<span>still trembling… </span>
</p><p>
<span>still digesting the venom that threatened to end her completely. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I do not do this for myself</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I’d walk through hell on living feet for you </span>
</em>

</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t move. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was frozen with her own words that were thrown echoing in her head as tears ran down her face. Everything in her screamed to go after her. But her body couldn’t. Instead, her mind replayed the way Rio’s face fell over and over again– the moment the words left Agatha’s mouth– her wife went pale. She stilled for a moment, her expression blank before those soil eyes became wet with tears. Her wife’s proud and broad shoulders slumped as her lip twitched as if she was holding back a sob and Agatha swore she heard the audible crack of her black heart. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook out of it, because it couldn’t have been the damn rabbit. Rio was being reckless like always. She found herself in the nursery before she even knew what she was doing, her heart pounding in her chest. The box for the unbuilt bookshelf sat in the same place in the corner, untouched as Agatha’s breathing quickened. She swallowed hard, her hand on her stomach as she made her way to the greenhouse, ignoring how the cold bit at her face as the door swung open. Inside, it was all the same. No new projects, the herbs all in the same place, the flowers the same perfect purple, the azaleas now in bloom. Agatha froze by them, her cheeks wet as her hand caressed an azalea’s velvet petal. Her hand shook as she plucked one, bringing it to her nose as her eyes squeezed shut, taking her back in time.  </span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“You know what they mean, right?” the raveness beside her asked as they both stared at the vase full of azaleas next to their bed. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The morning golden light was just spilling in from the window, making the dark soil of Rio’s irises a liquefied amber, revealing hints of hazel and swirls of dark chocolate. Her attention moved to Rio’s back, the muscles subtly flexing– the lines of her shoulders down to the curve of her spine. Heat entered her cheeks as she thought of the other night– when she pushed Rio onto the bed and grabbed her by her hips to flip her over. Rio didn’t need any more directions, going on her knees arching her back as her chest rested on a pillow Agatha placed under her at the last second. She smirked, remembering her own hands tracing the outline of muscles, her thumbs moving in circles over them as Rio purposely flexed them for her. She half wondered if Rio would get a back tattoo the moment they did have the money. Goddess, it would be the end of her life if Rio did. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She snapped her attention back to her girlfriend, when she moved, leaning over to pluck one the flowers from the vase. The golden morning sun highlighted more of her muscles in her arms, the bicep Agatha wanted to dig her teeth into–</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Cariño, are you listening?” Rio was now facing her, the covers pulled over her naked body. “You’re staring.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, going to quip back when strong hands were on her. She yelped as her girlfriend manhandled her, laying her on top of Rio, their breasts squished together, their legs entangling, and their noses gently brushing. Rio was cold like always, but Agatha ran hot so the cool body was perfect, and yet… it warmed something deep within her as her eyes fluttered closed, butterfly wings caressing her nose. She loved mornings like this: Rio holding her, placing kisses to the nose she used to be so insecure of and yet, her girlfriend was obsessed with it. The way her hands and fingers would run through her hair, soothing her and telling her without words that Rio loved her. It was months ago, during the summer underneath the stars that Agatha had surprised Rio and said it first, and yet it was still delicate, still horrifying, and still something Agatha could barely wrap her head around. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>And yet, Rio somehow understood. They didn’t say often, just moments where it truly was warranted. Moments like last night, when something triggered Agatha– she wasn’t sure what, but her childhood came all rushing back– the beatings, the bruises and broken bones she hid, the one time her mother shaved her head in her sleep to “teach her a lesson.” Hence, why Agatha always kept her hair long. But nothing compared to the words, the way such small things embedded themselves into Agatha’s very being– she was a monster, she destroyed everything she touched, didn’t deserve love– that she was too hard to love. And here was Rio, loving her like it was as simple as breathing air. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She remembered not being able to breathe, trying to pull away from Rio before she destroyed it, but Rio wouldn’t let her. No, Rio held her. Let her cry, scream, and sob without a single look of judgement, only a deep understanding, and Gods, it broke Agatha even more. Her girlfriend held her in bed, whispering over and over again, that she was not unloveable, that she didn’t destroy everything she touched, that she deserved to be loved– and Gods, for the first time in her life she actually believed it. Agatha was never good with spoken words, despite being a literature nerd, and in the moment, she replied in kind the only way she knew how. Rio and her made love deep into the night and as always, Rio was there, promising the world to her. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>A calloused but tender thumb caressed her cheek, her eyes fluttering open to stare down at the woman. She followed the slope of nose, to the column just above her lips that led to her nose, and then to her lips where a line ran down the center of her bottom lip. Her own thumb brushed over it, as her eyes took in her jawline, her cheeks, those puppy eyes that could make her fold with a single look when Rio wanted something. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio started slowly, her voice still scratchy from sleep, but holding something that was reverent, deep. “Do you know what azaleas symbolise?”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She shook her head, not trusting her voice as she sat up slightly on Rio’s chest, looking at the single azalea Rio twirled between her fingers.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“The colours of course have meanings and red is normally love, purple for royalty–” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>‘And here she goes,’ Agatha thought fondly, as Rio started yapping about flowers instead of going straight to the point. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“The language with both colours and flowers goes so far back, but purple because it’s your favorite, and the flower itself? They promise new beginnings– the cycle of life, death, and rebirth. But when given, worldly– they symbolise ‘love’ and ‘gentleness,’” a faint pink entered Rio’s cheeks as her eyes flicked back to Agatha. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>A hand came forward, fingers brushing through her wild mane but with a tenderness that Agatha never knew existed, the flower was placed behind her ear as Rio smiled, that cute little gap between her teeth revealing. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio’s voice turned to a quiet but certain whisper, “I give you these to say– I will never stop loving you with all the gentleness you deserve.”  </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio never strayed from her words– she kept her word like it was a blood oath…</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio was wrong. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha did destroy everything she touched. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was frantic, tears bursting from her eyes, not even realizing she was in the basement, still clutching the azalea as she stared at the TV, </span>
<em>
<span>TheSims </span>
</em>
<span>still playing with what she assumed was Villanelle and Eve. She would have laughed– she would have shook her head, call her wife “pathetic” because if Rio had the writing skills she would be one of those pathetic losers who wrote fan-fiction, hyper obsessing over lesbians who didn’t exist– over the stereotypical lesbian couple where one of them dies in the end and the other just has to live with it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, her eyes narrowed to the couch where a deep maroon stained a green blanket and something on their carpet looked suspiciously like a tiny paw print of blood. Rio was telling the truth. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Of course she was– you just had to ruin it– destroying everything you touch, </span>
</em>
<span>a voice in her head sneered at her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hand shook violently as she reached for the phone on the couch, pausing the music. She felt her body go numb as she realized her wife left her phone, no way of contacting her unless she called the hospital– but it was </span>
<em>
<span>too </span>
</em>
<span>late…</span>
</p><p> </p><p><em><span>"To not say something I can’t take back. Because</span></em> <em><span>you</span></em> <em><span>already</span></em> <em><span>did</span></em><span>.”</span></p><p> </p><p>
<span>Because </span>
<em>
<span>she </span>
</em>
<span>already did. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha found herself upstairs on their couch, her hands on her stomach, but no movement came. There wasn’t a push against her palm, not even a shift inside her. He was utterly still. She rubbed a little harder, pressing her hand more firmly. She </span>
<em>
<span>needed </span>
</em>
<span>his movement, needed something to ground her. Scratchy was nowhere to be found. Her feet hurt from pacing and standing at the conference and she knew she was going to lose it if now her son was ignoring her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And he did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not a single shift or hiccup. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Just the eerie stillness she realized </span>
<em>
<span>she </span>
</em>
<span>caused.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A pain sobbed escaped her throat as her mind plagued with her mother’s words. They clawed at her throat, tearing into her very flesh as every loving kiss from her wife, every tender embrace– was washed away. She destroyed everything, and somehow she held onto this delusion for fifteen years that she could have Rio forever. But no, love was not meant for Agatha Hakrness. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Go ahead cry– you think your life is hard? </span>
</em>
<span>Evanora’s voice screamed at her. </span>
<em>
<span>Try giving birth to a fucking monster like you. You ruin everything you fucking touch. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was going to leave her– come back and slap divorce papers and pack. And then, Rio would take their son away from her– claim she was unfit in court with her history of being abused by her own mother. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Another sob surged from her body, trembling her very being as her heart felt as if it was tearing in two. Her body was weak as her fingers almost clawed at her stomach– another part of her begging for their little one to move. He was always active this time of day, right after lunch, and his </span>
<em>
<span>mami </span>
</em>
<span>happily fussed over him, allowing him to kick her hands as she whispered soft Spanish to him that seemed to make him so excited, rolling and pressing against her stomach as if begging to be in Rio’s arms. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He deserved a mother who would love him so much that he felt like he was the moon, stars, and sea– and Agatha… she didn’t know if she could be that mother. But Rio could– she would be– she would spoil the shit out of him, dress him up in costumes, buy matching clothes, hold him close when he got scared, chase him in their backyard, teach him about nature… and Agatha? What would she even do? </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please,” her voice broke through the eerie silence. “Please, my purest love, move.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>He didn’t. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Oh. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>He knows. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Another sob broke from her. Their son already knew the kind of monster she was– he already knew how she would snuff out any candle, any light. He </span>
<em>
<span>knew </span>
</em>
<span>what a terrible mother she was already becoming and she had barely begun. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t mean it,” she whispered, voice raw and shaking. “I didn’t mean it. I didn’t mean it. Please, please– oh!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She broke off into a sob hugging her belly tighter to herself as Rio’s face flashed in her mind– the tears, the betrayal, the heartbreak– </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I-I didn’t– didn’t mean it,” she hiccuped even louder. “I-I was scared, my purest love, so scared that-that she-she would– that something would-would hap-happen to her.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Another sharp wail.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I-I can’t do this without her. I can’t– I can’t– please, I can be good. Pl-please, don’t go quiet on me. Don’t leave me too.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers pressed harder against the curve of her belly, not in pain, but in desperation, like she could force herself back into worthiness by sheer will alone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please– please, little one. </span>
<em>
<span>I can be good</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
<em>
<span>I can be good</span>
</em>
<span>. Just one little kick, one roll– please!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The stillness echoed like a grave. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And that was when the panic tipped into collapse. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her body folded in on itself, curling sideways onto the couch, arms around her belly as if shielding him from herself. Her face buried into the couch, muffling her sobs– the soba were loud wails, ones that came from the very depths of her soul– a soul that felt as if it was being left behind by death herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<strong>***</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She didn’t know how long passed, not until the light spilling into the house was dim with the setting sun. And not once did their son move. Her soul continued to grieve the loss– the loss of her the love of her life, the loss that </span>
<em>
<span>she </span>
</em>
<span>caused– because she was unloveable. Because it was inevitable that she would be her own demise. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her cries consumed her to the point she didn’t hear the faint groan of the door creaking open. Didn’t hear the slow shuffle or the grunt of pain from the foyer. Didn’t notice the lights flipping on nor the sound of her own name being called once, twice– soft and worried– like she already sensed something was wrong beyond the fight from hours prior. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Only when she felt a fingers push her hair out of her face did Agatha look up. Rio stood over her, still in the gray hoodie, stained with blood. Her face was blotchy, her eyes tired and red rimmed from her own tears. She looked wrecked and yet, there was only immediate worry as Rio’s lips moved, but Agatha couldn’t hear her. Instead, the raging sob came, spilling from her as she realized her wife was back. Rio didn’t leave her. There wasn’t hate in her eyes. Sure, hurt, but Rio returned. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife was trying to talk to her, but Agatha couldn’t hear it. She sat up, ignoring how she struggled with the added weight before standing. Before she could stop herself, to even think that Rio would need space, she launched herself, angling her body away from Rio’s freshly stitched side as she nuzzled into her neck. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She almost gasped when arms wrapped around her, fingers combing through her hair as Rio hushed her softly, pressing kisses to the side of her head. But it wasn’t enough. She </span>
<em>
<span>still </span>
</em>
<span>said </span>
<em>
<span>that </span>
</em>
<span>to Rio– to the one person who loves her unconditionally. To the one person who saw right through her walls without even trying– the woman who constantly grounded her, protected her, worshipped the fucking ground she walked on– the woman who had been there the moment she revealed the stick to her, cherishing, always a step ahead of what she needed… a woman who worked for weeks carving a crib from scratch just so their son would feel extra loved. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha Harkness was a monster. She destroyed everything she touched, and worse, she hurt the woman that she loved with every cell in her body… and their son growing inside her was still, refusing to move… sensing the evilness of his mother. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, oh Rio–” she lobbed louder into her wife’s skin. “I’m sorry– I didn’t mean it. Pl-please Rio.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Cariño,” </span>
</em>
<span>her wife’s voice was gentle, but it cracked with its own raw pain. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pl-please! I-I’m s-sorry. I’m sorry,” she couldn’t stop the wave as her voice was visceral. “I can be good. I can be good! Please, please! Please, my love!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Fingers were continuous through her hair, the other hand cradling the back of her head as she cried into the crook of her neck. Her wife pressed soft kisses to her head as she continued to cry, unable to stop begging and apologizing and part of it was for the son who refused to move. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You </span>
<em>
<span>are </span>
</em>
<span>good, </span>
<em>
<span>cariño–”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” she croaked, refusing to pull away from her. “No-no-no, not after what I-I said– oh, Rio. Please, please, pleasepleaseplease.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“My love” and oh how Agatha’s heart leapt at those words  “you need to take a few breaths. You’re having a panic attack.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha couldn’t. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t stop trembling. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t stop sweating. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her heart was pounding. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her breath was restricted, and the pain in her chest wouldn’t stop. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The breathing exercises, remember them?” Rio’s voice was a calm melody, guiding her to the eye of the storm. “In through your nose, love. Out through your mouth. In. Out.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>With a mix of Rio’s delicate beating heart and lulling voice, Agatha’s cries ceased. Her breathing came back, matching her wife’s as more soft, lingering kisses pressed to the side of her head. She didn’t know how long they stood in each other’s embrace, more kisses pressed to her head as they swayed carefully, both aware of Rio’s stitches. They swayed until Agatha noticed the ache in her lower back, the uneasiness she felt being on her feet for this long. Without a word exchanged, Rio pulled away, their eyes locking for a breath and when Agatha saw her wife’s soil eyes, she looked away, unable to fathom the pain in them. Rio didn’t push, just merely took her hand and guided them to the bedroom. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Both hurt in their own ways, they still moved in sync, in a tender but aching quietness as Rio helped her out of her shirt before Agatha was fully undressing Rio– her wife unable to bend down. The bandaged now wrapped around her torso, the blood gone, but each breath shuddered with pain as Agatha struggled to bend down as she pulled Rio’s joggers off of her. At this point, she would have teased her for her boxers filled with cartoon bones. Her wife would have swept her into her arms, maybe made love to her, or just cuddled her and they would talk of their future. Instead, Agatha turned to their dresser where a half glass of water remained alongside Rio’s pill bottle. Her wife took the pill without a fight before laying down on </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha’s </span>
</em>
<span>side instead. She blinked but Rio weakly held her arms out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just…don’t put too much weight on me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha climbed in beside her, her head resting on Rio’s chest, her belly resting on her good side. They didn’t speak. They just laid there in their hurt until Agatha’s tired, pregnant body couldn’t take it anymore, easing her into a dreamless sleep with her wife still by her side. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">
<b>***</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha awoke to her whole body being sore. Every movement hurt in its own type of way and yet her eyes were the worst. They were heavy, tired– dry with too many tears shed and somehow not enough as she lifted her head, finding she hadn’t moved from her position at all. Her head was on Rio’s chest, her belly on her, away from the bandage that wrapped around her. Rio was breathing loudly– she never exactly snored, but her breath was loud, as if she were greedy for air. She half-wondered if it was Rio vaping for almost ten years straight before finally quitting for their wedding. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She sat up slightly, looking at the arm wrapped around her back, the hand resting near her stomach. She rubbed her stomach, wondering if he would finally move. He didn’t, and Gods, the images, the pain, the broken look on her wife’s face all came rushing back. She could cry again, sob, dive into Rio’s arms– beg her for forgiveness, but she knew she didn’t deserve it. Her eyes flicked over her wife’s features, finding the pinch of her eyebrows finally relaxed, that haunted expression gone, and her whole body fully rooted into their bed. She was out cold, probably thanks to the amount of medicine in her system… and well, thanks to her after breaking her love’s heart. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha slowly got up, scared to jostle her as she went to the bathroom, barely brushing her hair, but cleaning her teeth as she walked out into the kitchen. She felt robotic, her body drained from emotions, but her heart was burning alive, begging her to do something– make it up, somehow, but she didn’t know how. What do you say to the love of your life as you break their very soul? </span>
</p><p>
<span>She ended up sitting at the kitchen counter, not having the energy to make tea or even have toast… she took a few deep breaths, her hands on her stomach, rubbing, searching– but he did not move. Her body was a big fat liar when it came to the stiffness of her eyes, and the tears were back as she searched for him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please, please, my purest love, move for me,” she begged. “Just a flutter. </span>
<em>
<span>Mami está aquí</span>
</em>
<span>. She’s home, so please, </span>
<em>
<span>por favor, mijo.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Nothing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She placed her forehead on the cool countertop, watching her tears drip onto the dark marble until she heard hesitant footsteps padding from their room. She perked up, but the steps faded into the living room, the couch cushion making the softest noise before the television clicked on. She swallowed hard, standing up from the counter and starting tea as she already heard the strange inspirational music of a nature documentary filling the home. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Okay, semi normal. Maybe, we just move forward, </span>
</em>
<span>she thought to herself as the water finished and she quickly made Rio’s favorite green tea with Dragonwell, before making hers a simple herbal with honey. She made her way slowly into the living room, finding Rio laying on her back stiffly on the couch. Her eyes were trained to the clicking of whales and immediately she recognized one of Rio’s comfort series : </span>
<em>
<span>Secrets of Whales</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“They’re known as killer whales, but their real name is orca,” </span>
</em>
<span>Sigourney Weaver started before the orcas whistled and clicked on the screen. </span>
<em>
<span>“They’re the ocean’s top predator.”</span>
</em>
<span> An orca floated closer, its body tilted as it sang.</span>
<em>
<span> “But their tough reputation is because they put family first.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Ouch. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio flinched as well, but hers was deeper, because Rio constantly put them first, and stupid fucking Agatha– </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha placed the mug of tea down next to her wife before crossing in front of her, sitting on the other side where Rio’s feet were. They didn’t speak, tension crackling between them as Sigourney droned on. She couldn’t count how many times her wife had watched this series and didn’t understand how she didn’t grow bored. Instead, Agatha folded her legs underneath her, rubbing her stomach and trying to coax to their son to move. He still wouldn’t as if he could sense the tension between his mothers– there wasn’t a lack of love between them, just something hurt and she swore their little one was picking up on. She swallowed back the tears again, but her mind was running rampant. Did </span>
<em>
<span>she </span>
</em>
<span>do something physically? Did </span>
<em>
<span>she </span>
</em>
<span>hurt him when she was spiralling over her wife? What if her panic attack caused something– maybe he didn’t get enough air and… she killed him…? </span>
</p><p>
<span>She bit her lip, shaking it out. It was a moment of weakness. Just one panic attack. Nothing that could have caused any permanent harm. Sometimes babies went still and perhaps he was moving, she just couldn’t feel it between the overwhelming emotions draining her and her wife the past three days. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moved her hands, her body moving on muscle memory as she shifted closer to her wife, placing her feet in her lap as her thumbs worked the knots out in her calves. She let the motion of her thumb ground her, digging into a knot as Rio laid her head back, but she wasn’t ready for the </span>
<em>
<span>tone </span>
</em>
<span>to leave her mouth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you doing?” Rio’s voice was rough, raspy, but an underlying anger was there.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She froze, her hands still wrapped around her wife’s leg as she stared at the orcas on the screen instead of meeting the intensity of her Rio’s gaze. She knew if she looked, she would sob, cry, and beg– but she already did that all last night. What more was she to do? </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I-I just thought– um,” she trailed off, not really having an answer. </span>
</p><p><span>“Agatha,” the way her name was spoken sounded like a death sentence. “</span><em><span>We </span></em><span>are </span><em><span>not </span></em><span>going to just sit here and pretend like you</span> <span>didn’t say </span><em><span>that </span></em><span>to me last night.” </span></p><p>
<span>She felt herself bristle on the spot. The switch was flipped and her defense built in an instant as she turned her head slowly towards her wife. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am </span>
<em>
<span>not </span>
</em>
<span>doing that,” she spoke darkly, but before she could even snap– say something else she knew she would regret, Rio’s own gaze darkened into something she had only seen directed at someone else. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>No,”</span>
</em>
<span> Rio growled, her voice carrying an ancient power behind it. “</span>
<em>
<span>You </span>
</em>
<span>don’t get to talk to me like that after what </span>
<em>
<span>you </span>
</em>
<span>said. Do you even realize how badly </span>
<em>
<span>you </span>
</em>
<span>hurt me, huh? It was more than what any knife could do.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed, the switch flipped back, “I didn’t mean it–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, but you still said it–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was scared!”</span>
</p><p><span>“You were cruel,” her wife’s words were final, cutting deep into her and taking the air from her lungs, but Rio didn’t stop there. “You were cruel.”</span><span><br/></span> <span>She said it again, quieter this time, but no less sharp. Her voice was shaking, raw, ragged at the edges that pierced Agatha’s very soul. She went to open her mouth, but there was nothing. No apology would ever be enough. How could she apologize for becoming the monster she was always destined to become? Nothing could patch how Agatha tore open Rio’s heart and destroyed each of her four chambers. </span></p><p>
<span>Rio shifted, pulling her legs back from Agatha’s lap like she was reclaiming something– her space, her boundaries, maybe even her sense of self. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I </span>
<em>
<span>know</span>
</em>
<span> you were scared,” Rio continued, her voice breaking at the edges. “But that doesn’t make it okay. You looked at me, and you made me feel like I didn’t matter. Like I didn’t love you enough. Like the last six months– fuck, like the last fifteen years didn’t even matter… like I was just some dog on a leash following you around because I didn’t know anything else.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s not true, Rio,” Agatha whispered, eyes wide as the tears made her blue eyes look like glass. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head, her hand clenched into fists in her lap as she replied, “It doesn’t change how it felt– how I felt. You know what it did to me to walk out that door with blood soaking through my side, and the only thing I could think was that you– ” her voice cracked, and she bit it back. “That maybe you didn’t want me anymore.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Something snapped hard in Agatha as she partially lurched, “No– no, Rio, don’t say that. Please– you know that is not true.”</span>
</p><p>
<span> “I’m saying it because it felt real,” she snapped, breathing hard now, tears collecting at the corners of her eyes. “You basically told me that I didn’t care to hold my son. Our son. Do you know how many nights I’ve poured over those stupid ass baby sites– watched every video on pregnancy, on baby’s health, on parenting– how many fucking times I talk to him when you’re asleep? How many times do I actively have to stop daydreaming in the middle of a lecture– imaging you with our son– whether he will have my eyes or yours? If he will have your chin or my nose? Do </span>
<em>
<span>you </span>
</em>
<span>even realize how long I spent on the crib? How long I toiled between taking care of you, keeping up with work, and making sure it was perfect?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That did it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes filled instantly, her breath hitching. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know I messed up,” she whispered, her voice strangled. “But I never meant to say that. I didn’t mean to make you feel that way– I see you all that you do! please– </span>
<em>
<span>te veo, </span>
</em>
<span>Rio– ” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t finish. A sob cracked from her throat, raw and wrenching, and she doubled over slightly, hands cradling her belly as her breath started to catch. It was worse than last night. Her whole body refused to hold her up as pain ruptured through her very being. One hand clawed at her throat as she choked out the sobs, grief and guilt and fear, pinning her down and having their way with her. The sobs slowly turned into something that was a mixing of hyperventilating and choking. Her face was burning and worse, their son still wasn’t moving. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s face changed in an instant. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha?” she asked, suddenly stricken. “Agatha, breathe.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I c-can’t–” she gasped, trying to sit upright. “I– he’s not– he’s still not moving– Rio, I think– I think something’s wrong– ” </span>
</p><p>
<span>All of the hurt, the fury, the sharp edges Rio had carried with her melted into ash as she moved from her spot, a mix of carefulness and franticness as she sat beside her wife. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, hey, hey, look at me, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor.</span>
</em>
<span> We’re going to the hospital–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“NO!” she choked out, turning and burying her face into Rio’s shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Goddess, she was horrible at this. Rio was the one hurting and yet, she couldn’t stop her own self from hurting as well. Yet, that was always the way with them, even when they first started dating. If one of them was hurting, the other would feel it too– not as strong, but dull and aching as if their very souls were connected and it was moments like these that Agatha believed their souls were– also the hormones pumping through her very being. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded against her, kissing her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Okay, yeah, so there was a fear of hospitals added in whatever mass of problems she definitely needed to see a therapist about. She swallowed it down when her wife was stabbed, but that still didn’t stop her from yelling at every nurse until she was allowed at Rio’s side. But for her, it was worse. Agatha kicked and flailed, even if her own bones were broken she refused. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hated medicine. Agatha hated hospitals. What a wonderful duo. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was going to be such a stubborn cunt when it came time for their son to join them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her wife knew, she always knew. If anything her mind carried her back to the first time Rio dragged Agatha kicking and screaming to the hospital during college. Agatha cussed out any nurse that tried to make Rio leave, but to her own surprise, Rio </span>
<em>
<span>did</span>
</em>
<span> stay. Her hand never left hers– in fact Alice and Lilia actively had to bring them food because Rio would refuse to leave her side. It was that same day, Rio had learned the amount of times Agatha had gone to the hospital as a teenager and was left there alone because of her mother. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, okay,” her wife murmured. “Just breathe with me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha obeyed, syncing her breaths with Rio’s the way they had practiced in those sporadic online prenatal classes– classes Rio dragged her to, though they both knew they should attend more. But fear made a coward of her. When it crept in, Agatha’s instinct was always the same: run, or push it away before it could push first. Now, trembling in the quiet aftermath, she pressed her face beneath the shelter of Rio’s chin. Rio breathed deeply, exaggeratedly, within the limits of her stitches– offering rhythm, offering anchor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha’s breaths soothed, when the pain of breathing faded, lips were placed to her head, the voice was just under a whisper and it trembled : “I love you, Agatha. I think more than either of us will understand.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And the tears were back, but they stilled the moment Rio’s hand rested on her stomach, because the moment it did, there was an obvious nudge, a hard push inside her that seeked Rio’s touch. </span>
<em>
<span> </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat up straighter, her hand coming next to Rio’s. The nudge was stronger, a steady press against both of their hands. Agatha let out a choked out laugh in surprise. Beside her, her wife pressed a gentle kiss to her cheek. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s alright,</span>
<em>
<span> mi amor,</span>
</em>
<span>” she whispered softly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed hard, “And what about us?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She expected Rio to pull away, to flinch back, but she didn’t; she kept right at Agatha’s side, kissing her head, her hand searching for their son who responded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We will be.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded. It wasn’t what she wanted to hear, but it was better than the alternative. It was better than Rio and her screaming at each other. She closed her eyes, breathing through her nose, wishing she could go back in time and take it all back– to be the one rushing her to the hospital instead of spouting venom. She sounded so much like her mother. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not your mother,” Rio startled her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She always wondered if Rio had magic and was able to read her thoughts, “How did you know I was thinking that?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife kissed her head again, “Because of how scared you are to become of her. Because you actively acknowledge it– because </span>
<em>
<span>I know you.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, “That still doesn’t change that was something she would have said.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then why </span>
<em>
<span>did</span>
</em>
<span> you say it?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s voice wasn’t raised. It wasn’t angry. It was only calm, curious. It was Rio wanting to understand her more– and perhaps Rio already knew… </span>
<em>
<span>Rio definitely already knew. </span>
</em>
<span>She just wanted Agatha to say why– for her to realize why. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because I am </span>
<em>
<span>too </span>
</em>
<span>scared to lose you, Rio,” her mouth was moving before she realized it. “I am so fucking terrified because I </span>
<em>
<span>can’t </span>
</em>
<span>do this without you. I saw the blood and all I thought was rushing you to the hospital– of all the monitors– of something going wrong– of the fucking impossible where you don’t take another breath. ” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tears sprang from her eyes, but a hand was cupping her cheek, tilting her face up for Rio’s lips to press against them– kissing them away. Her heart was pounding, its veins unravelling from the muscle and reaching out towards the woman. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, I did what was easier. I lashed out instead of falling apart… because if I fall apart and you’re not there… who is left to pick up the pieces?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha replayed what she said to her wife over and over again and she realized…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They both loved each other more than either of them could or would understand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The couple sat in silence, Agatha’s words echoing in both of them. Neither knew how else to respond… so they sat there in their hurt, in their love…so grand, so profound, written deep in the fabric of the cosmos itself… </span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>They moved slowly– awkwardly. The hurt didn’t vanish from Rio, but her love didn’t either. Agatha took whatever she could from Rio who willingly held her, kissed her head, and moved slowly with her in the kitchen as they prepared leftovers between lunch and dinner. They remained close the whole day despite needing space, but they found their space in the silence– in the silence of pages turning of books, in the silence of pens scribbling for grading, or crackling of keys as Rio answered emails. Even in the background of noise between nature documentaries or Agatha pulling up live videos of Fleetwood Mac on the television. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Through it all, there was a peace in the house that unsettled them both, not in the way that they weren’t really talking, but more in the way of something that partially started the fight… Rio was the first to notice it, looking around the floor. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where is he?” Rio asked softly, snapping Agatha’s attention from the baby blanket she was doing the finishing touches on. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head, “Señor Scratchy.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked around herself, knowing the bunny usually pressed up against her stomach when she was crocheting, but the caramel spotted fuzz ball was nowhere to be seen. </span>
</p><p><span>Rio turned to her, “You didn’t get rid of him, did you?” </span><span><br/></span> <span>She raised an eyebrow, wondering if she was hoping she did, “No, and he wasn’t around last night either.”</span></p><p>
<span>Her wife went to stand, but Agatha snapped her fingers down, “Keep still, my love.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You should be resting too,” Rio bit back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ignored the tone as she wandered the house, checking under tables or any space she could see without bending over. Her hand remained on her round stomach. Their son decided to continuously turn and toss, pressing against her stomach since Rio coaxed him to move. He was being annoying– dramatic. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>So you go from dead silence to not knowing how to sit still, my purest love? </span>
</em>
<span>she thought to him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Also as if reading her thoughts, he delivered a decent kick to her ribs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Enough of that. Your </span>
<em>
<span>mami </span>
</em>
<span>is okay,” she muttered to him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It only earned her another kick. She rolled her eyes, keeping her hand on her side as he seemed to take interest in her hand, pressing against, jabbing at her palm, between her fingers. She hoped he had Rio’s endless curiosity. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She went into their room, finding nothing. Their bathroom? Nothing. The extra bathroom that would be for their son? Also nothing. Then, she moved into their nursery and there he was, sitting on her rocking chair like a mighty prince upon a throne that was not yet for him, but in his mouth was the azalea she must have left in the basement. Her heart dropped. Azaleas were toxic to most animals, especially bunnies and this little thing had it in his mouth. She moved, ready to yell at the stupid rodent, but he bounded away before she could blink. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha followed him out, her steps slow, a hand on her back that ached. When she made it to the living room, Señor Scratchy was sitting on Rio’s chest and in between Rio’s fingers… was the azalea. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I give you these to say– I will never stop loving you with all the gentleness you deserve,” Rio whispered, repeating her own words from so long ago. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha heard her, and for, who knows how many times she cried that day, tears ran down her face again. So, in the panic to hold her dignity– whatever was left of it… definitely wasn’t much… Agatha deflected with a joke. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Does that mean you have accepted Señor Scratchy’s apology?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted softly, rolling her eyes before softening, “No, definitely not, but I do accept yours.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Oh. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>There goes whatever was left of her dignity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pushed the bunny off of her gently, and he avoided her stitches, bounding away to hide again before Rio pulled her into another embrace, her lips soft, sealing their love with a gentle promise to her cheek. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Sunday came like the slow rise of the moon. It was </span>
<em>
<span>still </span>
</em>
<span>awkward, </span>
<em>
<span>still </span>
</em>
<span>a little painful, </span>
<em>
<span>still </span>
</em>
<span>a little tense. Yet, Agatha expected it. Part of her still couldn’t believe Rio allowed them to touch, allowed Agatha to lean into her embrace when </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> should be the time Rio would hate it. But Rio didn’t. She didn’t flinch, she didn’t push Agatha away… but she didn’t really speak. Nothing but time would heal the wounds Agatha inflicted… but what truly mattered to Agatha was that Rio was still there. Still loving her in silence, even when she knew there were moments Rio wished not to. Rio Harkness-Vidal would never stop loving Agatha Harkness, even if she was skinned to the bone and became Death herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sat in the window nook, blankets around her frame as she read Sappho and her history, holding the book on her stomach as she ate strawberry gelato. She was lost, losing herself in the rhythm, between Sappho’s own words and the island of lesbos itself. It was comforting, something that she remembered reading while hiding it from her mother as a teenager. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was in the basement, playing </span>
<em>
<span>TheSims </span>
</em>
<span>and actually relaxing. They were slowly getting back to normalcy, slowly healing, and that was enough for Agatha… for now. She knew her body, her very soul was crying for her wife, but Agatha knew she had to give her space. Her presence couldn’t heal everything. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She jumped when she heard the basement door creak open. Looking up, Rio was holding her laptop– her black rimmed glasses on the tip of her nose, her hair pulled messily into a claw clip, only in black sweatpants handing low on her hips… </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>And she’s not wearing boxers for once, </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha realized as her eyes trained on the V-line running into those sweatpants before her eyes were wandering up her abs, to her bandaged side, and to her green sports bra. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bit her lip hard, realizing now was not the time to be looking at her wife like she was. Rio was in no shape for what Agatha wanted to do to her… possibly emotionally, but especially physically. Yet, it didn’t stop the vague image of her grinding against those abs– sue her, her wife was hot and she was nonetheless </span>
<em>
<span>hers.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Mi amor,</span>
</em>
<span>” Rio’s voice had more spark to it than it had since she was stabbed and Agatha’s heart soared. “Did you see the students posted what happened on </span>
<em>
<span>The Spider’s Web</span>
</em>
<span>?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Right, Westview University’s mascot was a fucking tarantula which was partially why Rio wanted them work there. They had the mascot in the science center with the zoologist professor– the professor Agatha avoided like the plague. There was no way in hell she would ever hold that thing– and yet, Rio always wanted one of them. She had to talk Rio out of it constantly. And well, recently it worked with the fact they were going to have baby and Rio only thought of the fucking leg hairs bothering their son’s skin– not the fangs, not the webs, not the beady eyes– just the fact that tarantula’s rubbed their legs together to release their hairs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“They quoted you too,” Rio added, handing her the laptop before climbing next to her.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s one hand rested on her stomach as she scrolled to the top of the page to stare at the title : </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<u>
<b>Dean, Mother, and Protectrice</b>
</u>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted, “That’s a stupid ass title.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes, chuckling lightly as her wife’s critique before she read : </span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">
<span>In a harrowing event that unfolded this past Wednesday, students witnessed a confrontation in the central quad between Dr. Agatha Harkness and CEO of Harkness, Inc, Evanora Harkness. The pair were spotted by students speaking harshly to one another until in a flash, a knife was pulled on Dr. Harkness. She was heroically saved by Dean Vidal, yet, the confrontation has brought up questions both for campus safety, protection, and justice, as well as put Dr. Rio Vidal, Dean of Faculty, and Head of the Biological Science Department in the spotlight of controversy. </span>
</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">
<span>Dr. Rio Vidal was in the middle of a lecture when two students barged into her classroom, reporting that her wife, who is carrying their child, was being threatened. Eyewitnesses report Dr. Vidal responded without another thought, sprinting out of the hall and into the quad where the pair were now yelling at each other. </span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
<span>“Well, we heard the yelling and screaming– even our professor was concerned and we stepped out of class without another word. Dr. Harkness was there and then next thing I knew there was a knife. Dude, it happened so fast, I don’t even know if anyone had the chance to either run away or run to help her when we see this blur of green. The crack was sickening, but nothing compared to hearing Dr. Vidal yell in pain as she managed to get the hag onto the ground, throwing the knife aside,” a sophomore literature major told us on Friday after the attack. </span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
<span>The blur of green was Dr. Vidal physically subduing Evanora Harkness, who had raised a knife against Dr. Harkness, in an effort to protect her wife and unborn child. Police reported that the impact of the body slam broke multiple ribs on the CEO’s side, and though Dr. Vidal herself sustained a deep laceration on her ribs, she did not retaliate further. </span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
<span>“Bro, Dr. Vidal literally threw herself at the crazy b*tch. There wasn’t a single flicker of hesitation. And then once the hag was staying down, Vidal moved off of her and Dr. Harkness was there holding her. I want a love </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> strong,” a freshman Biology student commented, still in awe of the heroism of the Dean of Faculty. </span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
<span>Dr. Vidal and Dr. Harkness were then rushed to the hospital where Dr. Harkness confirmed her wife received six stitches and is healing at home for the meantime. However, friends of the CEO of Harkness Inc, have stepped forward, questioning the death of Evanora Harkness and claiming that our dean did this premeditated. But, police put out a statement that Evanora Harkness denied immediate medical care and succumbed to the intensity of her injuries of her own doing. Evanora was about to be charged for not only breaking the restraining order, but also for attempted murder. Evanora’s followers did not listen. So, this recent Friday, Dr. Harkness herself came and spoke on behalf of her wife : </span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
<span>“Evanora Harkness had never been kind to me, even as a child. I found myself hiding my identity, scared to make a single wrong move in fear of being hurt by my own mother. At the age of eighteen, I had run away from home and went to Harvard where I met my wife. She has taught me how to be myself, how to love myself, and how to accept the love she gave me. Rio has been my protector for as long as I can remember. </span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
<span>When Evanora broke into our apartment during our college years, we had put a restraining order against her… a restraining order that she had broken twice. On the second time, it wasn’t only my life threatened. It was our child’s life. The knife was aimed straight for my stomach, and I had no time to react until Rio was just there, protecting me like she always has done– but again, it wasn’t just me. Rio protected our child, putting her life in danger to make sure we weren’t harmed. </span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
<span>With this acknowledgement, I extend my deepest gratitude to Miss Eva Bracken and Miss Ireland McGrath, two bright freshmen students in both mine and my wife’s classes. Without your quick thinking, I may not be standing here today.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
<span>To the students also struggling with their identities: you are valid exactly as you are. Don’t let the world convince you to be anything else but yourself. The right people will love you back just as you are without change or asking you to be less of yourself. And when you find that kind of love, you’ll see how beautiful it truly is. Love can heal what feels broken. It can make you stronger in ways you never saw coming. But this wisdom isn’t mine alone. It comes from the woman who is stronger than anyone I know– the one who protects me, who holds me through every storm, who loves me with a fire and a depth that never wavers.</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
<p align="justify">
<span>And many of you know her as ‘The Green Witch of the Science Department.’”</span>
</p>
<p align="justify"> </p>
</blockquote><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha watched as those brown eyes softened, staring at her like she hung the moon and stars, but like always, they resorted to their teasing, “You just ruined my reputation at work.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I just figured the Dean of Faculty needed to be humbled. It was about to time the school knew what a hopeless lovergirl you– mmph–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lips interrupted words, soft and certain, pressing into hers with the heat of something tender and a little desperate. Rio’s palm pressed against her stomach– not hard, not possessive, just there, steady, like an anchor in the middle of a storm. As if grounding herself. As if reminding them both they were still here. Still whole. Still expecting a little one together. Agatha exhaled a shaky breath against her mouth, the last of their shared tension unraveling. The kiss bled warmth into the hollow of her chest, melted the ache she had carried since </span>
<em>
<span>those </span>
</em>
<span>words left her mouth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Their lips met again– slow, familiar, sure. Agatha reached up, cupping Rio’s cheek with one hand, her thumb pushing lightly against the subtle swell of her cheek. Her wife’s tongue slid languidly against hers. It was a quiet conversion between them, but not one of lust, rather a vow sealed in breath, lips, and tongue. She hummed into the kiss as she felt their love that once felt fractured, forged into something as hard as diamonds. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kissed her like it was forgiveness, as if to tell her that she completely forgave her– that Rio was no longer hurt. That there was no other place Rio would rather be than with Agatha at her side, her hand on her swollen belly, and their son happily kicking at </span>
<em>
<span>Mami’s </span>
</em>
<span>palm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they pulled away, their foreheads rested against each other’s. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you really mean it?” Rio whispered in awe as the lower half of her glasses fogged up from their shared breath.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded against her, “Every since word, my love. </span>
<em>
<span>You </span>
</em>
<span>are the reason I am strong– that I am even here building this life. It has always been </span>
<em>
<span>you, </span>
</em>
<span>Rio.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lips pressed against hers again until Rio chuckled against her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And what is so funny?” Agatha asked softly, seeing the smirk on her wife’s face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled softly, “You say I am the lovergirl, but Dr. Agatha Harkness, the Purple Witch of the Literature Department, just spoke a love confession to a group of journalists and now the whole university can see it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, “Don’t make me take it back.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife placed another kiss to the corner of her lips, “You wouldn’t. You love me too much.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t deny it, just smiled like a love stricken full at her wife, who smiled back at her. Their lips met again, pressing together like puzzle pieces as their noses brushed tentatively. A hand cupped her cheek tilting their heads slightly when teeth grazed her bottom lip, playfully nipping at her and making Agatha pull away with a gasp. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” she breathed, already feeling her skin start to heat up as her wife rubbed her belly more. “We can’t. You need to heal that wound.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife raised an eyebrow, “You were just eye-fucking me before I sat down.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was not eye-fucking you. I was admiring what is mine.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Same thing.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, I’m pregnant and hormonal, and your sweatpants were hanging onto your hips for dear life.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife only wiggled her eyebrows at her, making her laugh as she rested her head against her wife’s shoulder. A comfortable silence filled between them as her wife’s hand never strayed, feeling their son push against her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She moved the laptop off of Rio’s legs, cuddling closer without disturbing her side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I missed us,” Agatha murmured barely above a breath. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hummed, “We didn’t leave or break, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor. </span>
</em>
<span>Just evolved like how caterpillars transform. Sometimes we need a dormant stage not only to heal, but to grow into something more beautiful.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha held back her tears again. Damn Rio and her weird times she was good at words. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s so lucky to have you,” she said instead of responding. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife kissed her head, her hand brushing the hairs from her face before resting back on her stomach, “He’s lucky to have </span>
<em>
<span>you, mi amor.</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“But–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“But nothing, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor. </span>
</em>
<span>We are only human, not perfect cosmic beings and even then I think they mess up too– we can only do our best, and that’s what will matter to him in the end.” </span>
</p><p>

<span>Outside, the night crept in like a sigh, wrapping its velvet arms around the quiet house. The Harkness-Vidals moved through it with their usual, sacred ease. In the kitchen, they cooked together– slowly as Agatha sat when her feet ached but traded places with her wife the moment something needed lifted. Their bodies moved like twin moons in orbit, mirroring each other with ease as their hands brushed, their smiles only blooming for the other, and kisses were exchanged between moments of rice gently steaming on the stove. Rio lit candles in the dining room, their golden glow pooling across the table like sunlight trapped in wax. She arranged azaleas in a vase, their petals flushed with memory and meaning. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Later, when the dishes had been cleared and the world had grown quieter, they met under the cascading warmth of the shower. Steam curled around them, its own tender embrace as Agatha guided them so the water wouldn’t hit right on Rio’s stitches. Yet, her wife pressed up against her back, skin on skin– Rio’s hand over the life they created together. And it was there they acknowledged how they would burn the world for each other if it brought a moment of comfort for the other. </span>

<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was still dark outside, yet the birds were already humming their morning melodies through the chasm of a frozen wonderland. The wind had howled all through the night, making the house groan, shaking shutters, and rattling loose shingles. Frozen ashes had waltzed from the heaven, somber and delicate– mocking the stars as moved in February’s unforgiving grasp. It was colder than had been in weeks– yet February had never been known for its gentleness despite what the stars produced, still Agatha had long since forgiven the frigid month, for it had given her something far more eternal than death : her favorite person. Born beneath ancient constellations of Cetus and Andromeda, and Pegsus and Pisces– a woman of seafoam and moonlight. A Pisces, the most romantic of them all. Her lovergirl. Her protectrice. Her steady river of life. And before her pregnancy, she called Rio the weighted blanket that bit her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She would be lying to herself if she said she didn’t crave the pressure of her wife draped over her body, pinning her into the mattress (not like that you freaks, yes I am talking to you) half-asleep nibbling– her shoulder, the soft arc of her collarbones, and most of the time her breasts if they were easy access. Her wife was like a giant cat mixed in with a piranha, all tongue or all teeth, covering her in her affections and devotion. Just a consequence of marrying Rio Vidal. But now, especially with her large belly, the roles were reversed… minus the biting. Her head was always resting on her wife’s chest, listening to the rhythm of her wife’s black beating heart, their legs entangled softly like kelpe braiding itself together just beneath the surface… but that was before the wound, both emotionally and physically.    </span>
</p><p>
<span>The emotional bruise was beginning to fade, yes, but Agatha knew better than to believe that yesterday’s apologies could fill a canyon. So she did what she knew best, the ancient language that both she and Rio understood by heart : love, expressed through acts of service and offerings given not out of duty, but out of devotion. So she had risen at six, before the sun and her worshippers, and despite not having to leave until ten thanks to a two hour weather delay… she might have to call Alice and ask her to clear their driveway if the snow was tall. She hadn’t checked. She had other priorities this morning. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She had already ordered flowers to be sent to her wife’s desk : carnations, tulips, Baby’s Breath, violets, with a single azalea in the center. She remembered Rio telling her carnations were for mothers– a symbole of motherhood and deep familia love. The tulips were easy, a message of her own love and devotion for her wife. The Baby’s Breath was for their little one and the violets… something to make her wife chuckle as giving a sprig of violets as in the late 19th and early 20th century, worshippers of Sappho in Paris wore them on their clothes. Finally, the azalea– to symbolise that she, in turn, would promise to love Rio with all the gentleness in the world she deserved. She had the florist leave a note : </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>To my protectrice. To my love. To the mother of my child ~ 💜A</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That was only part of what she planned. Valentine’s Day was this Friday and she had to make up for the fact she couldn’t dress in lingerie and torture her wife. That would have to be for Rio’s birthday. Instead, she pulled out her Ipad and she splurged while holding a shiny new credit card. From the will, they now had enough money where they could retire right then and there, buy a bigger house, have a giant greenhouse and Agatha’s dream of a Narnian wardrobe that lead into a secret library, have a couple more kids, put them all through college without a problem, and go on one of those ridiculous rich cruises with bottomless mimosas, island hop, and do whatever rich people do. </span>
</p><p>
<span>So, the stainless-steel Cartier love bracelet was put in her cart along with a Cartier love necklace “paved” the site said… whatever that meant other than it was littered in diamonds. Then came the kadupul flower seeds. They weren’t expensive, just priceless in their own way. The Queen of Night– a flower that only blossomed at night before dying at dawn. Agatha didn’t know why she was drawn to it, perhaps the meaning of rare beauty or the meaning of “something unattainable…” she knew Rio would love it anyway. She found a onesie… a site for custom made onesies– not that she would tell Rio– with “Mami’s Lil’ Sprout.” And then of course the monstera. Agatha found a </span>
<em>
<span>Monstra Crème Brûlée, </span>
</em>
<span>full grown, its leaves huge and on sale for a thousand dollars. It would arrive some time after Rio’s birthday, but close enough. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, she stood at the stove cooking Rio’s favorite lunch– oddly enough, a croque monsieur with homemade fries and a caesar salad on the side. She would pack it as a surprise for her wife for lunch in her office. And after she was finished with making their lunch, she would continue Rio’s breakfast in bed– quiche Lorraine with egg-in-a-hole buttermilk biscuits. The quiche was done, already pulled out of the oven to cool with the biscuits sitting warm in the microwave, she just had to make the eggs and bacon for the biscuits. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She set the homemade fries aside, stealing a few that were already cool before cracking the eggs into the pan with one hand, her other on her back. Okay, yeah, it was hurting big time, but she would be fine… as long as the little gremlin would stop aiming for her ribs. Their son turned again just as she placed her hand against the round bump, feeling him press against her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Easy, my purest love,” she murmured to him, only to receive a hard kick against her palm. “Do you want me to sing the song I wrote with </span>
<em>
<span>Mami</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He turned in agreement and as Agatha continued cooking for her wife, she sang softly to their little one : </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<em>
<span>Seekest thou the road to all that’s foul and fair</span>
</em>
</p><p align="center">
<em>
<span>Gather sisters fire, water, earth, and air</span>
</em>
</p><p align="center">
<em>
<span>Darkest hour, wake thy power, earthly and divine</span>
</em>
</p><p align="center">
<em>
<span>Burn and brew with coven true and glory shall be thine… </span>
</em>
</p><p align="center">
<span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Just as she nestled the eggs into the biscuits, a quiet shifting echoed from their bed down the hall. Rio was stirring– likely reaching for her across rumpled sheets. Agatha grabbed the tray, topping off Rio’s coffee with the smallest swirl of crème before making her way down the corridor… slowly. Gods, she was slowing down at an embarrassingly rapid pace. </span>
</p><p>
<span>With a nudge of her foot, she pushed the bedroom door open and smiled at the sight that greeted her. Rio lay sprawled across the bed, drifting in and out of sleep. Her black hair was tangled into a wild nest against the pillows, one arm flung over her eyes, mouth parted slightly as she breathed deep and steady. The quilt was twisted around her waist, her black T-shirt riding up just enough to reveal the clean white bandage on her side. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning, my love,” Agatha whispered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife groaned in reply, refusing to move the arm over her eyes. Agatha rolled her eyes with fondness and walked over to what used to be her side of the bed. She placed the tray on the nightstand, then sat carefully beside her. Gently, she took her wife’s hand and guided it to her belly, where their son was already kicking. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s been like this all morning,” she said softly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, her arm still shielding her eyes, but her hand remained, fingers splayed across Agatha’s stomach as the little one danced beneath her palm, “How long have you been singing our song to him?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze, caught off guard. She hadn’t realized Rio could hear her from the kitchen– hadn’t even known she was awake. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“A while,” she admitted, brushing her fingers along Rio’s. “I hum it when I’m in the office. He starts thumping like a rabbit when I don’t.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>A quiet chuckle rumbled from Rio as she finally moved her arm, revealing sleep-heavy brown eyes. Her gaze dropped quickly, watching the faint, shifting motion beneath her hand as their son kicked again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where is the </span>
<em>
<span>pequeño demonio</span>
</em>
<span>?” she murmured. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha paused for a moment, looking for the furry creature on the floor before she lifted a shoulder in a half-shrug,  “He only really comes out when I eat. He’s been hiding since yesterday. I think he feels guilty.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hummed approvingly and placed both hands gently over Agatha’s stomach. The baby kicked again, eager under her touch. A soft laugh escaped her lips as she soothed gentle circles across her wife’s skin. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Tranquilo, conejito. Tranquilo</span>
</em>
<span>,” she whispered, and the kicks slowed. “</span>
<em>
<span>Estoy aquí</span>
</em>
<span>.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned her attention to the tray, drawing her wife’s gaze again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio looked up, her expression softened even further, “</span>
<em>
<span>Mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on,” Agatha murmured. “Let me help you sit up.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groaned theatrically, but allowed herself to be propped up, more pillows tucked behind her as they moved in a slow, practiced rhythm. Once she was settled, Agatha placed the tray across her lap– piled with enough food to feed at least three. Her wife raised an eyebrow at the offering but said nothing, simply leaned forward and kissed her– slow and sweet, a morning acceptance granted with lips instead of words.</span>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<b>Students </b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Ryan shifted under their gaze. The eyes were harsh, mouths parted in disbelief, as if he spoke a foreign language, as if he told them that he was Sharkespeare himself reincarnate… if only he could escape death. But Death was close, breathing down his neck and standing in the very eyes of the women who sat across from him. He felt small under them, like he was standing before gods awaiting judgement. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>You did what?” </span>
</em>
<span>Eva shierked at him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He took a step back, swallowing hard as even Ireland looked livid. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She threatened my football career. You don’t understand. I </span>
<em>
<span>need</span>
</em>
<span> the scholarship,” he protested, backing up further. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>She </span>
</em>
<span>is a new professor,” Evan seethed. “</span>
<em>
<span>She </span>
</em>
<span>doesn’t have tenure, </span>
<em>
<span>she</span>
</em>
<span> isn’t in charge of scholarships– </span>
<em>
<span>she </span>
</em>
<span>is nothing more than a crazy jealous cunt who has no power compared to the fucking Dean and </span>
<em>
<span>her wife!</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The wife that is actually pregnant,” Ireland muttered, her gaze distant. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Eva raised her head, “Do </span>
<em>
<span>you </span>
</em>
<span>have any fucking idea what the dean will do to you when she finds out?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ryan gawked at her, “</span>
<em>
<span>When</span>
</em>
<span>?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, ‘when,’ because you are going straight to Dr. Harkness and telling her,” Eva about snarled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Or Dr. Vidal herself,” Ireland nodded, without looking up from her phone. “I would crawl to Harkness first though. Vidal is probably already on high alert after what happened– saying she killed for her wife and unborn child.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ryan swallowed hard. Right, their Dean literally killed someone for her family… someone who threatened her family… What would she do to the one who started the rumors though? Surely, he wouldn’t be killed… right? </span>
</p><p>
<span>Eva stepped closer, jabbing her finger into his chest, “You have to tell her. Maximoff is fucking crazy. She shouldn’t be on this campus with an obsession like that on Harkness– especially while she is carrying Dr. Vidal’s child.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ryan felt his breathing quicken, his heart pounding in his throat. Ireland was the first to notice, placing a hand on his shoulder to relax him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s not going to get mad at you, Ryan,” she spoke softly. “You’re a student. Maximoff is a professor. Of course you felt like you had no other choice.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>He shook his head, “I-I tried telling her– I swear. But everytime I go to Harkness’ office alone, Maximoff is there– like she just knows.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Eva stood back off and said, “Okay, then we come with you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now?” Ryan squeaked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The women both nodded at him, their faces hard. He looked towards Poets’ Haven, fixing the strap on his shoulder. It was only Harkness and after her speech on Friday, they all had seen a rare tenderness they didn’t know the professor could possess– but it was all for Vidal. The rest of her calculating, measured, and almost as cold as Vidal, except she was mean, viscous. What would it mean for Ryan when all of that came to a crossroads… when Harkness’ own love and protectiveness of her wife was met with the callousness of her work persona? </span>
</p><p>
<span>It now made sense to Ryan why the professor wanted their lives private. They were not meant to see that tenderness, that deep aching love that they had for each other. It was too sacred, too real for the minds and hands of students, co-workers, and strangers alike. It was only for Harkness and Vidal, and soon, for their ‘mini’ Harkness-Vidal. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, come on, before class starts up.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>With that, they were off, hurrying quickly towards Poets’ Haven but something made them all miss a step as an imposing figure came through the glass doors. She walked stiffly, her movements careful and slow, yet she was more different than that. She looked softer– a pink in her cheeks that wasn’t from the cold and a green emerald dress. It was loose fitting, one where you could tell it could have been tied tighter around her waist, but left as-is. Her boots looked familiar though, something that Dr. Harkness would wear that came to her ankles. Her hair was pinned in a bun, glass framing her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Vidal was not in her usual pants and buttoned shirt. They watched as a hand raised to her stomach, holding where stitches were as her eyes caught them. Then, she turned to them, her steps calm and measured… and it took everything in Ryan not to bolt. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Miss Bracken, Miss McGrath,” she said smoothly stepping before them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dr. Vidal,” they all greeted, Ryan taking a step back to put his friends as a buffer between him and the professor. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How are you feeling?” Eva tested the waters, knowing any other day, the professor would roll her eyes and say something cold. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She nodded her head slowly, “Healing, still sore, but otherwise fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And the stitches?” Ireland added, curious of her honesty. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She laughed lightly, spooking them all like they were horses as they flinched back, “Six, and they ruined one of my tattoos. Plus, I already tore them.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Eva gaped at her, “What?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She laughed again, but this time it was distant, something flashing that none of them had seen– something that looked a little sad, “The rabbit has it out for me. I am fine now.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have a rabbit?” Ryan’s mouth opened in shock this time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>That seemed to be the question that snapped the Dean into her usual cold demeanor. She cleared her throat, turning her head to study them for a moment before starting to step around them, but Ryan could see her underlying, uncharacteristic, nervousness.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Miss Bracken, Miss McGrath,” she started slowly, she sounded strained, like whatever kindness she was trying to get out was foreign on her tongue. “Thank you for-um getting me that day. I apologize for snapping at you first– but-um, it means a great deal to me– more than I can say.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>With that, Dr. Vidal turned, refusing to hear their reply as she made her way towards what was the music building. The students stood there stunned, watching after the dean with their mouths open. Their stunned expressions stayed there as they made their way through Poets’ Haven and passed Dr. Maximoff’s office and to Dr. Harkness’. Eva and Ireland pushed Ryan forward to knock while they kept their eyes on Maximoff’s door.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Knock. Knock. Knock. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>A click of a door sounded, but it wasn’t Harkness’ at least not right away. Dr. Maximoff came out in a red dress, a mug in hand as she peered at them. It was obvious, her gaze hardening as she stared dagger into Ryan’s head. Ireland caught it immediately turning to Eva. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I really hope she’ll explain </span>
<em>
<span>Othello</span>
</em>
<span> better,” she said on the spot, Eva joining in the lie to throw the other professor off. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Maximoff seemed keen on this, turning back into her office as if she wasn’t just watching them. And just as her door clicked shut, Harkness’ door opened. Harkness was already turning away, moving bouquets away from the chairs and couch. There were dozens upon dozens of flowers, some scattered on the floor, others on different tables, but the only flowers that seemed to matter to the professor was the bouquet of purple azaleas in a vase on her desk. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Excuse the clutter,” Harkness waved a hand, the other on her round belly as she sat on a chair across from the couch where she motioned the students to sit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dr. Harkness,” Eva started slowly as they sat across from her, watching her soothe a hand down her stomach as she shifted uncomfortably. “How are you?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The brunette flicked her hair back, “We can skip pleasantries, Miss. Bracken. I assume Dr. Vidal sent you to collect your gift.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The students blinked at her as Dr. Harkness grabbed two envelopes off her desk, handing them to Eva and Ireland. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We weren’t sure what exactly was appropriate to thank you for your quick thinking last week. But we figured two five-hundred-dollar gift cards to that huge bookstore in town would do as well as recommendation letters for whatever you two would need.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Eva and Ireland both gasped, their eyes wide as they opened up the envelopes to a gift card and two written out recommendation letters signed by one Dr. Agatha Harkness-Vidal and one Dr. Rio Harkness-Vidal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio’s,” she cleared her throat, catching herself. “Dr. Vidal’s might get you further if you are looking at bigger scholarships or thinking of Ivy Leagues for a masters or doctorates due to her position. We both also are close with two distinguished professors at The Salemite’s University if that is something you two might consider.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>They went to open their mouths, ready to get on their knees and thank the professor. Their hearts were pounding, smiles so bright they could barely contain themselves as they squealed in excitement. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Before either could even start, Harkness held up a hand, “Thank me and I’m taking them back.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her gaze then slid to Ryan, raising a perfectly curved eyebrow, “Mr. Renard, what brings you to my office?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The girls snapped out of their excitement, nudging at Ryan to talk, but he found himself frozen under her crystal blue eyes. She turned her head, going to cross her arms, but then winced, a hand back on her stomach. Yet, the silence stretched on as Ryan breathed in harshly, the words on the tip of his tongue. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Harkness groaned, her hand stretched out, “Well?” </span>
</p><p><span>Eva spoke up, “It’s about the rumors from last semester.” </span><span><br/></span> <span>Ireland nodded, “More specifically with Dr. Vidal being pregnant and you sleeping your way through the faculty.” </span></p><p>
<span>Both Eva and Ryan hit her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But Dr. Harkness' face remained unfazed. The only tell was the curl of her fingers against her stomach as she sat up, staring the trio down. Ryan swallowed hard as Harkness lifted her hand again, motioning them to continue. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ryan took a deep breath, “Last semester, Dr. Maximoff–” Harkness’ gaze visibly darkened at the name, but Ryan was rambling now, talking as fast as he could  “approached me and telling me that she overheard Dr. Vidal said something like ‘my little one’ and ‘</span>
<em>
<span>mami.’ </span>
</em>
<span>She told me to spread the rumor that Vidal was pregnant. And if I didn’t or if I told you or Vidal, my football scholarship would be gone, and that my sister wouldn’t get into any university.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Harkness blinked slowly, processing his words as her hand went still, but there was a different anger written on her face as her eyes narrowed to the door of her office and then into the direction of Maximoff. She sat back slowly, like a predator receding into its coils, a quiet and terrible stillness, one a lioness would use in the high grass of savanna hunting antelope. Her nails, which Eva now noticed were digging into the arm of the chair, but the only two sharp ones were her pointer and pinky. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Now was the wrong time for Eva to realize exactly how gay her literature professor was. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She threatened you,” Harkness murmured, not a question, but an invocation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her voice was honey over steel, each word delicate and dangerous. Ryan gave a jerky nod. Eva shrank slightly behind him, eyes darting between the lines of fury etched on Harkness’ face and the way her other hand never quite left the gentle swell of her belly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ryan, still full of nervous energy, squeaked, “I didn’t know if it was true or not… but she-she made it sound like it was just harmless gossip– we didn’t know you two were actually–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Silence,” Harkness snapped, her eyes flickering between the three of them. “The only reason Rio hasn’t torn this university down is because she’s too busy protecting our child.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>They all grew still, the snap of bones echoing in their ears as Harkness continued.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you realize how stressed she’s been– how stressed, how upset, how defiled she was when she heard that she was pregnant when in reality we were hiding an actual child that </span>
<em>
<span>I </span>
</em>
<span>am carrying,” her voice was low, laced with a protective poison. “Dr. Maximoff was warned to stay in her lane. To keep her dirty claws to herself. And now she dares to weaponize a child she has no right to even </span>
<em>
<span>think </span>
</em>
<span>of?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dr. Harkness stood in tall, radiant, dark elegance. She was powerful, even in deep trenches of exhaustion and pregnancy. She made her way back to her desk, dialing her phone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She will not touch you,” she told Ryan quietly, her voice softening “nor your sister. She will not touch any of you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ryan blinked, uncomprehending,  “But– my scholarship– ” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ll have it,” Harkness said as the phone rang. “And more, should you need it. You spoke the truth, Mr. Renard, even in the face of fear. Dr. Vidal and I have a high respect for those who do.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>A crackled through the speaker, “Agatha? What do you want, witch?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The students gasped, but a small smile tugged at the corner of her lips, “Lilia, we have a situation. Can you come to my office?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is this a Dean matter?” the older woman’s voice was hesitant. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Harkness nodded. “But Rio has enough on her plate. You and I will handle it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Calderu sighed, “I’ll be there. Pepper will be there as well.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wonderful,” Harkness’ voice was as thick as honey, coating over the glacier of anger just simmering underneath it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The professor hung up, sitting in her office chair as the three hesitantly stood, “It will be handled. Miss Bracken and Miss McGrath– you may go. Mr. Renard, you will stay and repeat everything you told me to Dean Calderu and Mrs. Stark. Neither of you will breathe a word of this to my wife.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They all nodded, Ryan sitting down as the other two went towards the door, but before they opened it themselves, it swung open with Dr. Maximoff standing there fuming. Her face was red, her eyes flashing with a wilderness that sent the two students back to block Dr. Harkness, but also in hopes to protect her as Maximoff stood tall, a crazed storm swirling around her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>You told Calderu?” </span>
</em>
<span>she breathed out like an angry dragon. “</span>
<em>
<span>Stark?</span>
</em>
<span> Over some harmless gossip. Over a few words–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Harkness snapped, fury radiating off of her as she stepped between Eva and Ireland, facing off the younger professor. “Over a threat.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, please,” Maximoff huffed, but the glint in her eyes was evident. “It was only a rumor, a half-baked one it seems as you both are expecting anyway. Don’t tell me Vidal broke over some words.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maximoff stepped closer, using her heels and barely there height difference to tower over Harkness as she sneered, her eyes sparkling with darkness. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aw,” she mocked with a fake frown before it turned sadistic. “Did Vidal cry over some </span>
<em>
<span>little words</span>
</em>
<span>?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The younger professor leaned closer, “I’m sorry you have such a weak wife. Just imagine what’ll happen when things get hard… when the little one comes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes clicked down to Harkness’ stomach, her hand raised, “It’s a shame, really. She’s going to break and then” she chuckled “she’ll leave you </span>
<em>
<span>all alone.</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Something in Harkness’ expression cracked, something like hurt and anger all swirled into one, but it wasn’t only from Wanda’s words. There was something else, something like grief that swirled in those blues as she seemed to remember maybe something more painful in her past. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was quickly squashed, anger shining deep when Maximoff placed her hand on Harkness’ stomach, “</span>
<em>
<span>I wouldn’t. </span>
</em>
<span>I would take care–”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Crack.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The slap was deafening. It stilled everyone in the room except for Harkness who was already putting space between them, her hand over her stomach protectively. The students’ mouths hung open, ready to catch the flies when they came for Maximoff’s body. Wanda’s head had whipped to the side. A red bloom spread across her cheek, precisely the size of Agatha’s hand. A small cut gleamed at the edge, where the emerald on her wedding band had struck home. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And to their horror, Maximoff laughed. She shook herself out like a predator waking up, then stepped forward, red spreading wider.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Cute,” she said, her voice cold and amused. “First Vidal kills your mother, and now this. You really think you’re justified? You’d slap the only person willing to protect you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The students wanted to gag, their eyes wide in disbelief. Even Harkness seemed staggered by the audacity of it– her brilliant and sharp mind struggling to shape words around such insanity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maximoff’s lip curled as the students stepped in front of her Harkness, seeing something just as dark as what gleamed in Evanora Harkness, “Students, you may go, and don’t bother getting Vidal this time. She’s too weak to even lift a finger.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then the students finally noticed the air changed the moment Harkness slapped Maximoff, but it wasn’t from either of them. It was coming from the doorway and it was dark, a stronger darkness that entered the playing field, something more final and powerful than death itself. The students saw her first, the dark irises of Dean Vidal standing with Calderu and Stark behind her. Their mouths were open, but Vidal… she was something else. Power radiated around, sharp, ancient, and protective. Gone was her flawless, cold façade, replaced with nothing by pure, unfiltered rage. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The younger professor seemed to sense her, turning with a bright smile at Vidal, “And here she is, of course. Careful, hun, don’t want to tear your stitches.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal stepped forward, but Ryan watched how she angled her body so the stitches were better protected. Yet somehow, Vidal loomed over Maximoff and the students watched as Maximoff started to crack. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>I told you to stay away from her,” </span>
</em>
<span>the Dean’s voice was deep and menacing. </span>
<em>
<span>“I warned you from even looking at her.</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Maximoff started to shrink, beneath Vidal’s gaze as neither Stark nor Calderu moved. The students were now backed against the wall, Ryan inching towards the exit as Eva and Ireland remained trapped between Harkness, and Vidal and Maximoff. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And then,” Vidal’s voice grew louder, as she grew closer until she was spitting into Maximoff’s face. “You </span>
<em>
<span>touch my </span>
</em>
<span>wife–” Maximoff flinched at the final word “and lay hands on </span>
<em>
<span>my </span>
</em>
<span>unborn child.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The students watched it in slow motion. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The pure panic in the redhead’s face and the moment she lashed out like a wounded animal.</span>
</p><p>
<span> A hand came up like Harkness’, but it wasn’t aimed at Rio’s face. It was aimed at her side where her stitches were. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But the dean saw it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hand reached out like a viper, catching its prey before twisting the arm away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal didn’t twist it out in the motion an officer would use to subdue a run away perp. No. There were three distinct cracks as she twisted the arm out, forcing the redhead to yell out in pain and surprise. The next movement was faster, Vidal slammed her into the wall beside them, cracking it before Maximoff crumbled to the ground, tears streaming down her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You think I’m weak?” the dean growled, still holding her wrist as she stood over her. “Huh, funny, ‘cause </span>
<em>
<span>I saw you, Maximoff. </span>
</em>
<span>I saw you when I ran across the quad, closer to her that day. And we both know who fucking froze.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Dean twisted her arm a little more as the professor screamed out, but no one said anything. No one moved. And there was no remorse for the wicked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ll never be anything more than a perverted coward, hiding behind red horns and broken excuses. And listen to me very closely, </span>
<em>
<span>puta–</span>
</em>
<span> this is the last time you’ll ever lay a fucking hand on my family.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>With that, Vidal turned on her heel, forcing Eva and Ireland to scramble out of her way as she rushed towards her wife. No one looked at Wanda as the girls found themselves beside Ryan who was still in shock. Their gazes narrowed towards where Calderu and Stark stood– the new Dean on the phone, talking to campus police. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The voice of the dean snapped their attention back to her, watching the tender scene. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Mi amor,</span>
</em>
<span>” the Dean’s voice was as soft as velvet, her hands on Harkness’ belly as hands cupped her face. “</span>
<em>
<span>¿Estás bien? ¿Te hizo daño?</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Harkness shook her head, her fingers caressing the Dean’s cheeks, “Your stitches, my love–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are fine, </span>
<em>
<span>mi vida.</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Vidal’s gaze softened as she pulled Harkness closer, her lips brushing against her forehead. The room was still heavy with the echoes of tension, but within the sanctuary of her embrace, Harkness could feel the warmth of their shared love seep through the cracks in her broken composure. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” Harkness whispered, the remnants of fear and pain still clouding her voice. “But I swear, Rio, if you tear your stitches again, I’ll–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shh,” her wife murmured, pressing a gentle kiss to her lips, silencing her protests. “I’m fine, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>. Don’t worry” her eyes, dark and full of promise, met Agatha’s “Nothing will ever harm us again. I won't let it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Wanda </b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Pain blurred her vision as her body went limp. Shock was setting in, pain encompassing her as the cracks in her wrists still echoed in her brain. Wanda hadn’t meant for it to go this far. Ryan was supposed to be too dumb to go to Agatha or Vidal, but then she saw his friends. They looked nervous seeing her and Wanda blindly believed one of the girls saying something about </span>
<em>
<span>Othello</span>
</em>
<span>. But then it clicked that they weren’t learning that play. Wanda had read Agatha’s curriculum for the semester and that Shakespeare play wasn’t in it. She had reopened her door– in truth she didn’t know what she was going to do, but she ended up outside of Agtha’s office, listening to those meddling fucking brats ratting her out. And then something took over. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn’t in control of her body, her body and voice having their own separate brain as she screamed at herself from the inside. The kids looked terrified and Agatha looked pissed. But she had no right. No right, when she could have just told her that she was married from the very start, instead of hiding it– instead of making Wanda a fool at both the Yule Market and the meeting at the beginning of the semester. It wasn’t Wanda’s fault. Vidal could have told her the moment she was called into her office. How was she supposed to know that Agatha always telling her “no” really meant “No, I will not date you” or “No, I am married to a very possessive woman” or “No, our boss baby trapped me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>That baby could have been her– she could have been the baby’s other mother just fine. Instead, it was fucking Rio. Rio– who didn’t hold a maternal bone in her body– who would leave Agatha the moment things got hard… Rio, the woman who willingly threw herself in front of a knife to protect her pregnant wife…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tears poured from her eyes– but it wasn’t from the pain now, no, it was from the fact that she had lost. It was from the very fact that Agatha was never hers in first place. There had never been a competition between her and the Dean. Agatha was always the dean’s and now… with the way they were embracing…Rio’s hands on Agatha’s stomach… and the way they were looking at each other. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda clutched her broken arm, vision swimming through a veil of tears as she watched Rio press tender kisses to Agatha’s face– each one drawing a soft sigh, each one melting her lover further into the touch. Spanish words fell like lullabies from Rio’s lips, too hushed and quick for Wanda to catch, not that she’d have understood them anyway. But Agatha did– Agatha always did– and she answered in kind, her voice low, intimate. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then they leaned in, breath to breath, their lips meeting in a kiss so delicate it might’ve been mistaken for a prayer. It lingered, sweet and slow, before they parted briefly– only to crash back together with desperate heat. Wanda stared, sick to her stomach, yet unable to look away. She watched in horror as their mouths opened, as Rio’s tongue slipped past Agatha’s lips and was welcomed with a fervent hunger. Agatha sucked on it greedily, their kiss deepening, repeating, again and again, until it was a rhythm of heat and devotion. Only when Calderu cleared her throat did they part– but only barely. The students stood behind them in stiff discomfort, but Rio didn’t retreat. She held Agatha close, possessive and proud, one arm firmly around her back, the other protectively cradling the gentle swell of her stomach– their child safe between them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Tranquilo, conejito. Todo está bien. Ahora estás a salvo</span>
</em>
<span>,” Rio’s focus was on the large bump underneath her palm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, a deep voice forced her gaze up at two officers standing over her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wanda Maximoff, you are under arrest for attempted assault. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to talk to a lawyer for advice before we ask you any questions…”</span>

<b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blindly reached out, searching for the warmth beside her, only to be met with cold sheets. She blinked slowly, finding it still dark, the sun barely grazing the surface as she sat up slowly, looking at her phone to find it was six in the morning on February twenty-second… her birthday and her wife was gone from bed. Confused, her gaze squinted towards the door that led to the hallway into their kitchen. There wasn’t the faint glow underneath the door for a hint of life beyond, nor did she hear her wife humming softly. Instead, she heard water bubbling– a soft rumbling from their bathroom. And from underneath the door came the illuminational tale of someone inside.   </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood up slowly, her back cracking at the ripe age of thirty-four, acting as if she was twice her age. She knew it was just stress from last week, and now, her wife was seven months pregnant, beautifully full of life. They were in the final stretch, the third trimester, and soon, Rio knew they would be in a hospital room, cradling their newborn son. She was a mix of nerves and excitement each time she thought of it. Agatha would probably break her hand, curse at her, curse at the nurses, and doctors the moment things kicked in, but Rio would hold her through it all. Gods, for nights she fell asleep to the image of her wife holding their son close, his little suckles and milk drunk sighs filling the room. Her wife would be the perfect mother, and she would have a little partner in crime. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She opened the bathroom door slowly, the warmth and steam from hot water encasing her. The mirrors and shower doors were fogged up, but the rumble was from their tub. The warmth made its way to her heart as she spotted her wife lying back in the tub like a regal queen. Her eyes were closed, her head resting back against the side where a towel was propping her up. Wild chestnut tangles were wrapped in a bun on top of her head. Rio’s eyes fell back to her face, finding her relaxed with a soft smile that lately has been a permanent expression there. It was the gentle knowing one, the one Agatha wore days after they flipped the little stick over to see the word “pregnant” staring up at them. It was a smile that expecting mothers wore, one laced with grace, serenity, and excitement. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes followed the curved slope of her nose, the curves of her cheek bones and down her sharp jawline. Her wife’s side profile could fucking kill. It was almost unfair how hot it was, but Agatha was hers, irrevocably hers. Rio </span>
<em>
<span>knew</span>
</em>
<span> she was </span>
<em>
<span>hers</span>
</em>
<span> sometime after they started dating. They were lying together on a picnic blanket in the quad, pushing each other playfully when Agatha pushed her a little too hard and she landed on her back with a grunt. Her girlfriend– somehow now wife– immediately hovered over her, worry etched into her features despite giving off the front that she was instead being smug. Rio endearingly saw through it as her girlfriend had raised an eyebrow, a silent question to ask if she was alright. Instead of being normal, instead of just kissing her girlfriend’s lips, or even pulling her girlfriend down on top of her, Rio had reached forward, her tongue dragging up her girlfriend’s cheek with an exaggerated slowness. And then, raw panic set it. Her eyes had gone wide, ready for Agatha to yell at her for it. Instead, she blushed, her cheeks growing pink, but she quickly hid it with a roll of her eyes and a scoff as their friends protested with noises of disgust. But, Rio had seen the blush and Agatha never moved to wipe her cheek clean, just pulled Rio back up before resting back against her. Rio’s black heart had leapt, because in that moment, when Agatha had simply accepted Rio’s weirder quirks, Rio knew </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha was hers</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s arms disappeared into the water, most likely, caressing the bump as she hummed their song softly. Rio couldn’t stop the stretch of her cheeks from the smile that plagued her as she stepped forward, kneeling behind her wife’s head. Her hands rested softly on her wife’s shoulders, announcing her presence carefully. Her wife froze for a moment, her body growing stiff before relaxing. Her wife tilted her head back, blue eyes shining up at her brightly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Feliz cumple, mi amor,” </span>
</em>
<span>her wife murmured softly, her eyes drooping slightly as a hand reached up from the water, caressing her cheek. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned over her, her face hovering like Spiderman, “</span>
<em>
<span>Muchas gracias, mi vida.</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The kiss was soft at first, soft velvet lips against hers as her wife’s nose tickled her chin. Then Rio smirked, realizing she was free from the restraints of injury and it had been a long two weeks. For the past two days her wife had been subtly teasing her. Just small things Agatha knew that drove Rio crazy. Yesterday evening, she had gotten out of the shower and went into the kitchen to see if her wife was finished with the dishes so they could watch a movie. She had promptly froze, her eyes widening and if she had dick, she would have had a hard on. Her wife was in nothing but </span>
<em>
<span>her </span>
</em>
<span>t-shirt, that barely went past her waist, and a green silk thong that left little to the imagination. But that was only the recent offense. The first was lingering kisses, a stray hand against her, as if it was an accident but Rio knew better. Then it was the suggestive comments. The teasing of her wife’s low voice, dripping into the one she uses before having Rio on her knees. And then it is the movements, the small suggestive actions between the ice cream, when they made sauce for dinner, and don’t get Rio started what her wife did with the cucumber. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The worst of them all was when Rio’s meeting ran late. She came home, fully ready to relax with her wife and stupid ass bunny who was slowly warming up to them again. The moment she stepped into their home, something was different. The lights were all off, and Rio could feel a certain charge in the air. She set her keys down, sliding off her shoes before switching on the lights. She had called out for her wife before making her way towards their bedroom. And then she heard a moan, and then her name, and then the buzzing of a toy. Rio did not have the strength to go into their bedroom, knowing she would not control herself and happily fill her wife’s needs. So, she went to the kitchen, slowly making dinner as every moan echoed down the hallway, her face grew more red and she was actively fighting to concentrate. </span>
</p><p>
<span>So yes, Rio was very sexually frustrated. Especially, when her and her wife had a very healthy, constant sex life. And her demon of a wife, had been teasing her for a week straight. It didn’t matter that it was six in the morning. She would finally be sated and happily make love to her wife on her birthday. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her tongue dipped into her wife’s mouth, licking at her tongue, before pulling back slightly as their spit connected for a moment before snapping back on their tongues. Rio happily swallowed, her tongue dipping further into her wife’s mouth as her wife hummed softly into her. Her hands landed on her wife’s shoulders, moving down into the warm water to cup her breasts. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife pushed her away, chuckling, “Mm, eager, my love?”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled away, moving to kneel by the side of the tub this time, “Two weeks, Agatha, and a full week of you teasing me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Moi</span>
</em>
<span>? I would never, sweetheart, not while you were healing,” her wife flashed her teeth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand moved into the water, caressing her wife’s stomach, “Mm, cute. I know you don’t moan that loud unless it’s from me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife sat up, turning her body towards her as Rio kept her hand along the curve, wondering if their son was asleep. Distracted for a moment, she missed the sparkle in her wife’s eyes as she leaned forward, pressing a wet kiss to her cheek. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jealous of a toy, darling? That’s a new low, even for you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shot her a look, her gaze hardened as the smirk grew on her wife’s face, “Two. Weeks. And don’t be so high and mighty, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>. It’s not like you lasted either.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And what” Agatha leaned back again “are you going to do when we can’t have sex for six weeks after our son is born?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She just shook her head, her tongue pressing against her cheek for a moment as she felt herself soften, “That’ll be different, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor</span>
</em>
<span>. We’ll be covered in spit up, elbow deep in diapers, and tired from the middle of the night feedings–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed at her, “I’ll be the one feeding him. I’ll become nothing but a milk bar.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She hummed her laughter, now feeling the harsh nudges against her palm, “Yes, my love,  a very gorgeous and tired milk bar, but I’ll be there with you, rubbing your feet or sitting by your side so you don’t fall asleep mid-feed.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips curved into something soft, something wistful, her teasing disarmed by the warmth in Rio’s voice. She reached down to brush wet fingers along the side of Rio’s face, lingering at the edge of her jaw. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ll fall asleep before I do,” she whispered, “head tipped back on my thigh, snoring so loud you’ll scare the poor babe.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio caught her wrist and pressed a kiss to the inside, just where her pulse fluttered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then you’ll have to wake me with a kiss,” she murmured, “like a fairy tale.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave a dramatic sigh, but her thumb traced Rio’s cheekbone with aching gentleness. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re impossible.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you love me,” Rio said simply, her hand spreading across her wife’s belly again, feeling their son twist beneath skin and water like a secret wave. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her voice went quieter then, reverent : “He’ll know, you know. From the moment he opens his eyes. He’ll know how much we love each other. How much we love him.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked down at her– her fierce, unyielding Rio, the one who once only showed softness like a blade drawn in warning– and saw nothing but tenderness now. She leaned forward, her forehead against Rio’s, her voice barely a breath. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He already knows, my love. He feels it. Every time you talk to him, every time you touch me like this…” </span>
</p><p>
<span>A beat passed, the air heavy with steam and silence and the slow rhythm of their son’s kicks beneath her hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then Agatha grinned, “But you’re still not getting laid yet.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a groan, knowing she was in for a long day. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Cruel woman,” she mumbled, going to pull away, but her wife’s hand slid into her curls. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You like it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife nodded slowly, “I know.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">
<b>***</b>
</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<span>They left early that morning, Agatha planning a whole day for them down to what she wore. Rio was happily putting on leggings when her wife appeared from the closet like a dream in a simple purple sweater dress. Her wife had groaned, going back in their closet and soon a pair of pants with a nice top was hitting Rio square in the face and a belt was dropped in her lap before her wife was raiding through their shared jewelry box. Rio pulled up a pair of nice black pants that had buttons all the way up– if Agatha was going to get in her pants later, she was going to regret her choice of pants. She pulled on the belt with the gold buckle before throwing on a tight green, of course, long sleeve. Once that was over her head, her wife was in front of her, clasping stainless-steel Cartier love bracelet on her and screwing it in place. She still couldn’t believe her wife bought her it for Valentine’s day, not to mention the Cartier necklace as it was also put on her neck. As grateful as Rio was for the money, she knew her and her wife would now spend the rest of their lives trying to outdo one another. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Whatever her wife had in store for today, she was in trouble, especially when her wife pulled out two packed Vera Bradley bags from under their bed and handed them to her before leaving her in their bedroom dumbfounded. She had called after her wife, but her wife had simply smirked, ignoring her and heading out the door. Rio had stared down at the bags, realizing they were staying overnight for the weekend. Before following her out, Rio grabbed Agatha’s pillows for her back and belly in case she needed it. Yet, she froze when her wife was gently coaxing Señor Scratchy into his backpack carrier, nodding at Rio and going outside to the car. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>So with backs in the trunk, Señor Scratchy sleeping in the backseat, Rio drove– of course she did, like always. Agatha was not a particular great driver and after Rio pulled into I-95, she knew they were heading into New York City for the weekend. It wasn’t her favorite place, fuck, Agahta hated NYC. They both preferred cities like Lyon, France or Salzburg, Austria. But, the two places Rio has always meant to visit in NYC : The New York Botanical Gardens and Thain Family Forest. Agatha was giving her directions, the perfect passenger princess eating </span>
<em>
<span>Rio’s </span>
</em>
<span>freeze-dried strawberries. Naturally, her wife was hand feeding them to her as she drove, her fingers teasing her mouth, which Rio stiffened each time. She swore she almost crashed the car when her wife placed her hand on her thigh and timing perfectly when to inch her hand up higher. Two and half hours… in the car… in NYC traffic… with a pregnant wife… She prayed to any deity to give her strength as at one point her wife drew closer, and Rio had to lace their fingers together to get her wife to stop. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They were in the city when she noticed her wife shifting uncomfortably. Her hand pulled out from Rio’s as her eyes closed, rubbing her stomach more, to ease the visibly kicks. Rio looked over quickly, her concern shining through even as she looked back to the road. She reached over the center console, easing the kicks as her wife shifted again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you alright, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor?” </span>
</em>
<span>she asked softly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife ignored her, sitting up and pointing at her to turn. She quickly recognized the grand The Plaza New York hotel, a tall white building with green accents. Rio felt her mouth drop open as they parked the car at the door, staring at the entrance as she was seeing in real time the tax brackets they jumped. Rio got out, helping her wife step out before grabbing their bags. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she grabbed Scratchy, she turned to her wife, “Why is Scratchy here with us?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife only shrugged, “You really trust Alice or Lilia to watch him?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, “My love, they’re our friends. A rabbit is easy to take care of.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife only shook her head as Rio sighed, guiding them to the front desk, “And when our son is born, who will you allow to watch him?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lip curled, as she turned her head away from her, making her chuckle. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Before reaching the front desk, Rio stopped her again, “Do you want to lie down before whatever you have planned, my love?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” her wife shook her head. “Today is for you. I’ll be fine.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She held back a groan, knowing how stubborn her wife could be, “My love, you’re going to be on your feet all day, and anyway, botanical jardins already don’t have the most forgiving of floors.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wide blue eyes met hers in panic, her mouth opening in shock before Rio’s arm was hit, “How the fuck did you know where I taking you?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ow,” she teased. “You know it’s bad luck hitting the birthday girl, right?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>That earned her another hit to her arm, indignant, “How did you know? Did Alice tell you?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head laughing, “</span>
<em>
<span>Mi amor, </span>
</em>
<span>why else would we be in New York. You hate NYC and I have only talked about coming back here for either the coffee place or the gardens.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That earned her another hit before her wife went up to the counter, her posture straightened as she flipped her hair back dramatically. Rio shook her head to herself as she followed her wife to the desk, sitting their bags down as the pair were already speaking. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mrs. Harkness-Vidal, yes of course. The Plaza One King– oh, you do realize there’s only one bed, ma’am? We actually have a deluxe two-queen available if you’d prefer–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tensed, already sucking in a slow, wary breath. But Agatha tilted her head in that lazy, lethal fashion, gaze fixing the receptionist like a predator eyeing her prey. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” she said sweetly. “One bed is perfect. You see, my wife doesn’t sleep well when I’m not wrapped around her like a vice and she’s been really helping back during this pregnancy.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The poor receptionist blinked and Agatha leaned against Rio, running her hand up and down her chest as her voice dropped into a purr, “And I’ve been told I’m very clingy in bed. Isn’t that right, sweetheart?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio coughed, biting her tongue as the woman behind the counter flushed crimson. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t stop. </span>
</p><p><span>“Besides, it’s her birthday. I plan to make sure she sleeps </span><em><span>very</span></em> <em><span>well</span></em> <em><span>tonight</span></em><span>,” her voice dipped a little lower, a hand caressing her jaw.  </span></p><p>
<span>The receptionist’s fingers fumbled against the keyboard, “Of– of course. I’ll just… finalize your check-in.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mm,” Agatha turned to Rio, who was now full-body hiding a grin. “Darling, will you carry me to the elevator, or shall I limp dramatically until someone takes pity?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head, eyes warm and exasperated, “You are a menace.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you married me,” Agatha looped her arm through hers, smug and victorious as they walked toward the elevator.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They were on top of the floor, Rio holding her wife close in the elevator until Agatha took her hand, and led her to their suite. Inside, the room was spacious enough for two people and the first thing Rio noticed was the giant headboard on the bed that definitely might break tonight if Agatha allowed Rio to have her way with her. The room was something of royalty and for a moment, she wondered how much her wife spent until she remembered they were practically loaded now. Rio sat their bags on top of the credenza in front of the bed as her wife sat down on the chair, avoiding the bed. Right, Agatha never let her outside clothes touch their bed and she would scream at Rio if she didn’t change before laying in their bed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio placed her wife’s pillows gently on the bed, tugging off the extra linen draped across it– she knew the cleaners never bothered with that layer. Then, wordlessly, she knelt before her wife. With tender hands, she removed Agatha’s boots, her fingers lingering to massage the swollen ankles beneath. Agatha let out a slow sigh, one hand resting protectively over the gentle curve of her belly. She offered Rio a faint, tired smile, but it didn’t fool her. Not completely. Rio caught the furrow in her brow, subtle but familiar– the quiet mark of weariness, of worry. She knew that look too well. It whispered of doubt, of frustration with a body that no longer moved with the ease it once did, a body that now demanded more than it gave. </span>
</p><p>
<span>So, Rio kissed her stomach, a gentle reminder for her wife that her body </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> working overtime. Their son was growing strong right beneath her skin, stubborn and already kicking– strong. Her wife had every right to be tired and car rides were uncomfortable in général. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you sure you don’t want to lie down for a while?” she asked softly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife shook her head, “My love, it’s your birthday–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you’re pregnant–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That doesn’t–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio cut her off again, “Of course it does. Agatha, my love, you are carrying our son. You can be tired.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Blue eyes looked up at the ceiling, warding off tears as her wife took a few deep breaths, “I know, but all I did was sit in the car while you drove, and I took a long bath this morning to ease everything so I could make today special for you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kissed her nose and then her lips, “You already have, </span>
<em>
<span>mi vida. </span>
</em>
<span>You’ve given me the greatest gift possible.” Both of her hands landed on her wife’s stomach. “You’re giving me a child– our child, made from both of us– made from scratch. And I can’t wait to meet our </span>
<em>
<span>conejito</span>
</em>
<span>.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>At the mention of ‘</span>
<em>
<span>conejito,’ </span>
</em>
<span>both their son and Scratchy thumped–  the baby kicking Rio’s palm and Scratchy from his place on the credenza. It earned a soft smile from her wife who leaned forward, meeting Rio’s lips softly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll be fine–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” she sighed, rubbing her stomach again. “Please, I promise I will let you know when I need to sit down or slow down.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up at her wife, her radiant, infuriating, too-proud wife, and sighed. Not from frustration, but from that heart-heavy place where love pooled deep and steady, like rainwater in the curve of a fallen tree. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“All right,” she said, brushing a thumb gently along the side of Agatha’s knee. “But I’m holding you to that promise, </span>
<em>
<span>cariño</span>
</em>
<span>. No pushing yourself for me. You’ve already done enough by carrying our little sprout.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>That earned her a soft, amused scoff, Agatha’s lips twitching into something fond and a little crooked, “Sprout? I thought you were settled on </span>
<em>
<span>conejito</span>
</em>
<span>.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I contain multitudes,” Rio teased, resting her cheek lightly against the growing bump. “And he is both, no? A bunny and a growing sprout. Soft and wild.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers threaded through Rio’s hair then, slow and soothing, nails just grazing her scalp. She exhaled deeply, as though finally letting herself lean into the rhythm of being cared for, the gift of stillness. The moment stretched like golden syrup, thick with warmth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I should’ve known you’d sweep me off my feet on </span>
<em>
<span>your</span>
</em>
<span> birthday,” Agatha murmured. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Technically,” Rio said, pressing a kiss to her belly, “you’re the one who checked us into the most dramatic hotel suite in the city and scandalized the front desk.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave her an unrepentant grin, “She asked for it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood then, and extended a hand, “Come on, my beautiful scary wife. Let’s go see what actual surprises you have for me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife swatted at her hand with a playful curl of her lip as she went to stand. Rio was about to pull away until she saw her wife sway slightly from the fast motion. Rio reached out, steadying her wife, with a small frown etched into her features. Her wife didn’t comment on it though, just moving forward where her belly pressed into hers as Agatha tried to stand against her chest to chest. Their foreheads touched and for a second they stayed like that, breath mingling, hands settled against each other’s waists. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s gonna be a long three more months,” Agatha sighed as Rio’s hand pressed to her back, rubbing in gentle circles.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kissed her forehead, “I’ll be with you every step of the way, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor.</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b>***</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha </b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was keeping her pace slow. Her usual long, quick, gay strides slowed into short and  measured ones. A hand was always on her back, easing each tender spot and when they stopped, her wife’s hand was always on the underside of her belly. Agatha found herself leaning more into her than she meant to, and internally, she was beating herself up for it. Today was Rio’s day and for the past fifteen years together, Agatha always made sure of that. Sure, it was no grander than her twenty-first, when they were actually legal to drink in bars nor was it grander than Rio’s thirtieth, but her thirty-fourth was special for her wife in their own way. A whole new story was starting for both of them– it did the moment Rio had said yes to wanting a baby with her, and somehow, Agatha couldn’t help but feel as if there was another story about to start though, as when their son would grace them with his presence, he would inevitably become their whole world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Yet, even after climbing a few sets of stairs, she could barely hide how winded she felt, how her steps became a little unsteady for a moment, and she hated it. She was strong, always independent even if her wife was there to help her, she sure as hell didn’t need help walking up a pair of bloody steps, and yet she did. She wasn’t ready for the sudden change of her body, for the sudden shift in her energy, or lack thereof. She wasn’t ready for the back pain, or how her face got a little puffy when she was hot. Nor for the pain in her sides of her stomach as it grew nor how her bladder became a punching bag. She hated the hot flashes where her wife would have to come running with a cooling rag and the hours Rio spent sitting before her on the floor, rubbing her swollen ankles. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The morning they left, she had stared at her naked body in the mirror, unfairly judging herself. It felt as if she lost her agency, the very control of something solely hers. The stretch marks, despite the cream, were still there, and part of her wondered if Rio only humored her when she rubbed the cream on them, pressing a kiss to each dark web. Her breast ached too, not to mention they had started leaking already, just a few drops that seeped through her shirt and the slightly mortifying part? Her wife was the one to notice, not her. Yet, she simply brought her a new shirt and a small wash cloth, and the next morning, Rio had her breast pads laid out with her bra. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was nervous for tonight, so fucking nervous, especially as the hours went on at the garden and her wife was guiding her with steady hands as they wandered the flora. She listened to her wife’s soothing voice, rambling on about each flower, their latin name, their meaning, when they bloomed, and what plants could survive the winter. Her wife weaved them through the crowded areas, asking people to move when Agatha needed to sit for a moment. Snuck her snacks when a craving would kick in, and walked her to the bathroom a couple times when their son found her bladder again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, they sat on a bench together, staring at the flowers in front of them while Agatha rested back against Rio, using her to support her body weight as she continued to ramble about the flowers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And that one is Hemerocallis, or a daylily. In Greek mythology, they say Hera and Zeus created the daylilies, which the name is a direct homage to Hera. Sometimes they’re called ‘Fire Chief Nicolas’ or the purple ones, ‘Nick of Time,”’ Rio gestured to the purple and orange patch in front of them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha wasn’t listening to the rest of her sentence, or least fully. Every time Rio said Nicolas or Nick, their son moved, carefully pressing against her palm, and for a moment Agatha’s mind drifted to the list of names she was browsing the one night when her wife wasn’t looking. ‘Nicholas’ – victory of the people and an Athenian historian, Thucydides, mentioned that a man named Nikolaos was part of the Spartan delegation sent to the Persian king during the Peloponnesian War. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was strong…</span>
</p><p>
<span>She rubbed her stomach, her mind frantic as she couldn’t let go of it. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Nicholas… Nicholas… Nicholas Harkness-Vidal. Nicholas Harkness-Vidal. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Gods, it had such a nice ring to it, and for a moment Agatha’s mind completely wandered to a little boy with hair as thick and wavy as both of theirs. It would be darker than hers, but lighter than Rio’s. He would have Rio’s slightly caramelized skin and fuck, those eyes– two sets of puppy-dog brown eyes staring at her. Then, that smile that so irrevocably Rio’s. Maybe her chin, at least the dimpled part of it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Would he love the earth like his </span>
<em>
<span>mami? </span>
</em>
<span>Be in the greenhouse with it, tiny little hands covered in dirt and her wife next to him, talking softly in Spanish to him. Would he love books and learning as much as she did? Sit in her lap for hours, begging her to read another chapter. Maybe he would like dinosaurs? Rio would definitely take him to the museum, buy them matching costumes. Would he laugh like Rio or like her? A deep chuckle where Rio tried to subtly hide her face as she laughed. A contagious snort like hers, shaking his tiny little body. Would he fidget like Rio– always drumming his fingers? Or would he fidget like her– playing with clothes, flexing his fingers. How dramatic would he be if they were both his mothers? How protective of those he loved? Gods, he would definitely learn Agatha’s manipulation tactics. And when they caught him, Agatha could hear her own voice scolding him softly. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Nicky.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Or Rio’s voice guiding through maybe learning his home work, </span>
<em>
<span>“Mijo, Nicky, mi flore.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Nicholas Harkness-Vidal.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicholas Harkness-Vidal. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky, or Rio would call him Nicolás. </span>
<em>
<span>Abuelita </span>
</em>
<span>definitely will. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span> </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor?</span>
</em>
<span>” Rio’s voice brought her out of her thoughts. “Are you feeling okay?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked up into those gorgeous chocolate eyes, praying to whatever god that he would have them. She smiled softly, caressing her wife’s cheeks, brushing her hair away before guiding her hand to her stomach. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Say that name again,” she whispered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicholas?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>And just like that, there was a hard kick to her wife’s palm. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Again.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicholas.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He kicked her again and her wife laughed softly, a sound so beautiful she wished she could bottle and keep forever.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicholas Harkness-Vidal,” Agatha’s voice was a soft whisper, scared to even break the moment between them. “It has a nice ring to it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife smiled, her eyes practically sparkling, “Yeah?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, slowly, studying her wife’s face, looking to see if her wife agreed. Rio’s smile was stupid big, a smile so grand that the gap between her teeth was on display. Her face was practically glowing, those chocolates becoming a sweet amber tea. And for a moment, they sat there, their hearts beating as one, their smiles making the room glow brighter, as the few people around them disappeared. Rio’s hands were smoothing over her sweater dress, her smile somehow bigger with each kick to her. If they were alone, Rio would be on her knees, resting her head on her stomach, kissing it and muttering soft, loving nothings in Spanish. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicholas,” Rio broke the silence, but it wasn’t abrupt, just in a way where the melody picks up after a few beats of rests in that perfect 4/4 time signature. “Nicolàs</span>
<em>
<span>. </span>
</em>
<span>After a flower?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“For you, my love,” she responded softly. “After something that you love, and our little victory.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lips landed on hers, a hand on her cheek as she melted into it before her wife pulled away again, hands back to her stomach, “Nicholas or Nicolàs</span>
<em>
<span>, mi amor?</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged, “Both maybe. We can decide when he finally joins us.”  </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">
<b>***</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Rio </b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her cheeks were hurting with how much she was smiling. Gods, this was one of the best birthdays Rio ever had, despite the photo album from her twenty-first and thirtieth that might have said otherwise. This birthday was everything, one she would not forget because her and her wife just found a name for their son while in the botanical garden, and he was being named after a flower. Not just any flower, one that held deeper meaning. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Fire Chief Nicolas– a homage to her past as a volunteer firefighter. She did it through college, but quit the brigade after her knee injury and because of Agatha. She started in the brigade to make sure other kids didn’t lose their parents the same way she had. She had seen her fair share of death during the job, but it never affected her, because it was just the circle– the balance. But when she could help, the adrenaline was unmatched. And when she tore ACL, her girlfriend at the time was a mess. Agatha thought the worst, and gods– call her selfish maybe, but she couldn’t stand the idea of Agatha going through what she went through. So, she handed in her papers, got drunk one last time with the crew who were basically her brothers, graduated, and went to Salem to get her doctorates with her now wife. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She wouldn’t change it for the world. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And to be named after the daylilies– well, in Chinese culture, they represented long and bountiful life. Something that Rio would fight for him to have. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Part of her hoped they could spell it the Spanish way, but she wanted her wife to choose. Afterall, she is the one delivering him into this world. If they had another, and if she carried that one, she knew her wife would give her the same. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A tiny thump from the floor brought her attention down the fluffy caramel spotted demon sitting next to her feet. His nose twitched at her and in his mouth was Rio’s golden earrings that he must have grabbed from her suitcase. Her mouth opened in shock as she bent down with her palm out, allowing the fluffy thing to drop them in her hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh… </span>
<em>
<span>gracias?</span>
</em>
<span>” she murmured, her eyebrows creasing in confusion as the furball hopped off to the bathroom where her wife was getting ready. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They had left him in their room when they went to the gardens, even though Agatha wanted to take him, but Rio knew she would be the one carrying both him and her wife around. Despite her wife trying and </span>
<em>
<span>failing</span>
</em>
<span> to shake her off, Rio had held her throughout most of their time there. She watched with a certain reverence as her wife was simply winded from taking a couple pairs of stairs. How her steps slowed, despite her usually outwalking Rio. She watched each tiny grimace on her face when </span>
<em>
<span>conejito </span>
</em>
<span>would kick too hard or the pain in her back would be more present. She held back her smile when her wife would grumble, looking for the nearest bathroom, every few often. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her favorite part was when they went to the Pine Tree Café, they sat next to each other in a booth. Her wife ate her lunch and finished Rio’s before resting her head on her shoulder. They spoke softly, speaking of Nicky, about possibly moving when he was two to a bigger home, a bigger yard, and a bigger greenhouse. They didn’t get far when Agatha stopped responding, promptly falling asleep on her shoulder, snoring softly. Rio had smiled, caressing her cheek and letting her go for about a half hour until she realized her wife’s neck would bother her in this position. So she had kissed her awake, ignoring the stares from curious children, of judgmental old hags, or dumbass men. Her wife jolted up, her head almost colliding with Rio’s jaw, before staring at her worried. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How long was I out?” she had asked, a slight panic in her voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had hummed, kissing her cheek as she lied, “Just a couple seconds, </span>
<em>
<span>mi vida.</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And if her wife saw the time, or actually knew how long she dozed off on her shoulder, she seemed grateful that Rio had said otherwise. Yet despite the persistence of it all, regardless of each unsteady step, the tired nod off, or her wife simply needing Rio’s hand, her wife was glowing with nothing but a beauty that Rio couldn’t stop being starstruck about. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She turned back to the vanity, finishing off her golden eyeliner before applying the bright red lipstick that Agatha always preferred to have her neck painted with after dinner against the wall of a building, or in an elevator, or against their front door when Rio was busy with said painting and trying to open the door at the same time. And once she was finished putting the earrings on that the bunny (huh?) had grabbed for her, Rio stood, finding the body length mirror. The suit was new : pine green, tight in all the right places, showing off her ass that her wife loved, and flaring at her ankles. The top was corset-like, strapless and tight– framing her waist and figure, and the top, a little V that formed her breasts in the soft curves of a heart. She wore the necklace her wife bought her for Valentine’s Day and technically could not take off the bracelet on her wrist as she adjusted the rings on her fingers, the amethyst shining brightly. Her hair was curled slightly down past her shoulder, the shorter strands framing her face. She looked more than good, and if they weren’t married, weren’t dating, and they met like this randomly at a bar, she was sure Agatha would have been all over her.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment she slipped on her heels to tower over her wife, the sound of the door creaking open made her head snap up. And there, standing in the light was her wife, or maybe it wasn’t her wife. Maybe it was some sort of Greek goddess that wanted to swipe her off her feet. Or some type of siren blessed by Aphrodite. Rio felt her jaw unhinge as she took in her wife, her brain went numb as the ethereal creature took a step forward. The dress was midnight purple, accenting each one of her wife’s pregnant curves. Her wife’s long locks were left to curl down past her waist, silver jewelry adoring her wife’s ears and fingers, one with a giant emerald stone. Around her neck was the pendant that Rio had gifted her years ago, a giant amethyst with the Triple Goddess shaped by silver wireings. The neckline was off the shoulder, wrapping around her like silk made from Arachne herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was moving forward before her brain caught up. Her hands landed on her wife’s waist drawing her forward until her belly stopped them from being chest to chest, and yet she loved it : their son, growing and protected between them. She leaned down, her lips centimeters from her wife’s before a finger came up, pressing against her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re going to ruin your makeup, my love. And mine,” her wife smirked, her own hands resting on Rio’s chest, her fingers tracing just above the top on her bare collarbones. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio only smirked and before her wife could stop her, Rio leaned down pressing a kiss just beneath her jaw on her neck. She left her lips there for a moment, allowing the lipstick to transfer before pulling away with a sparkle in her eyes. Her wife’s eyes were closed, her lips parted, mid gasp. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh, this night was going to be fun, </span>
</em>
<span>she smirked to herself, realizing how sensitive her wife was– affected by one gentle, but possessive kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife quickly snapped out of it, giving her </span>
<em>
<span>that </span>
</em>
<span>look before stepping around her and grabbing both of their coats, “Come on, my love. It’s time to celebrate you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife smacked her green blazer into her arms, before her hips swayed purposely, drawing Rio’s eyes down to her ass like a magnet. She watched her wife cross the room to the door, her mouth parted open, practically drooling at the sight. She only snapped her eyes up when Agatha turned to the side, raising an eyebrow at her, but Rio’s attention was on her stomach, and then on to the bright red lipstick mark proudly stamped to her neck. As if her wife’s pregnancy wouldn’t be enough to announce that she was claimed and happily married. And when her eyes found her wife’s lips, they were curved, wild and wicked, and her eyes sparkled with a certain tell that announced Rio’s end with the sound of a bell. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The bell spoke simply: take the succubus’ hand, and she would be led down a road lined with temptation, winding through woods where everything wrong felt deliciously right, and everything bad tasted sinfully good. And at the end of that wicked path, her wife would be waiting– draped in beauty, glowing with ethereal allure, wielding her charm like a blade forged for seduction and destruction both. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Translation? </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife was going to tease her mercilessly all night long between teasing touches, suggestive mannerisms, and weaponizing everything she knew Rio loved about her– and once they finally made it back to their room… well, Señor Scratchy would need bleach for his ears, a priest on speed dial, and enough bunny therapy to last a lifetime.</span>

<b>Rio</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Rio was going to fucking die tonight. Her body buzzed with the faint power of electric hunger, her very veins becoming the heated wires– if that’s how electricity worked. She didn’t know. Perhaps it was just a witch with purple strings of power encasing in her a spell that was too tight. A sliver of her mind worried about her dark green pants– were they dark enough? </p><p>
<em> Gods, please let them be dark enough. </em>
</p><p>Agatha had already walked out of the room, short heels clicking like the drums of death on polished floors, her hips swaying, knowing exactly where Rio’s eyes were as she made her way to the elevator. Rio grabbed her wife’s purse and followed, her eyes betraying her, staring at the way the dress wrapped around her wife’s figure. She wondered if Arachne cowered before her wife, drawing her silk, worrying if a single thread out of line, Agatha would pluck her legs off, <em> one by one </em> . Her hands reached out, having a mind of their own as the succubus stopped before the doors, pressing the button. The moment Rio’s hands landed on the curve of her ass, her wife’s lips formed into <em> that </em> grin. The grin that should have come with a warning label and a safe word, but Rio knew her wife. Agatha Harkness-Vidal never played safe, especially when her prey would gladly burn for her. </p><p>The lights above the elevator lit up as it made its slow ascent, rising to cage Rio in with a feral predator in sheep’s clothing. Her hands explored her wife’s figure, around her ass, to her hips where she was used to feeling bone– now she moved along the rise of where their son grew. Before her hands could move any further, a small chime alerted her to the doors opening where her wife was already stepping in. Rio followed as if Agatha had the handle of her leash, dragging her into the mirrored tin-can. Agatha turned before the doors even closed, but it wasn’t a kiss that met her. It was a claiming. Rio’s back met the mirror with enough force she would be shocked if the glass didn’t crack. Hands were gripping her jaw, the curve of her skull, pulling her in with a kind of urgency that could shatter bone. Lips waltzed down her neck like they belonged– they did– teeth grazing the tender skin, tongue flicking in a cruel apology. </p><p>“Eighteen floors,” Agatha murmured against her, her breath molten lava. “Eighteen chances to beg me for mercy.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t respond. She couldn’t think. Her brain had melted from the heat as her breath hitched, her spine arching as Agatha pinned her to the mirrored wall. One hand dragged along her waist, slow, deliberate, leaving heat in its wake. The other was firm beneath her jaw, keeping her still as that mouth– those lips– bit down hard enough to leave a mark. </p><p>Then the doors closed, a slight jolt as they began their descent. Rio fought to open eyes as her wife attacked her neck, trying to keep her pathetic whimpers quiet as from her hooded eyes, she watched the elevator ding with each floor they passed. And suddenly, eighteen floors felt like both eternity and finity. Her hands gripped her wife’s waist tightly, unsure if she would be able to stand without her. She trembled, soft sounds betraying her and leaving her lips without permission as her wife continued on her neck. And then, <em> ding! </em>The elevator not only tolled the arrival of the lobby, but Rio’s absolute lack of dignity as something slick, soft, and searing trailed up her neck and Rio whimpered when her wife pulled away, walking out like nothing at all had happened. </p><p> </p><p>But that was just the first offense. </p><p> </p><p>The second? </p><p> </p><p>It came in a long sleek black vehicle. </p><p>A limo. </p><p>A fucking limousine ordered like they were some incredible actrices or queens or some type of rich assholes– which they were now– to be taken to Da Andrea in Greeenwich Village, like they weren’t just two wives, mad and completely enchanted by the other. Agatha leaned into her, Rio wrapping an arm around her like it was instinct– supporting the swell of her belly, steady and sure– when a hand landed, innocent at first, on her thigh. Rio stiffened though, her instincts kicking into four wheel drive as she knew what was coming next as their driver turned on Rio’s favorite band : <em> Sleep Token. </em> She <em> tried </em>to ignore her wife’s hand, aiming a snarky comment about dramatics and birthdays, but her wife’s hand was already on the move, smoothing, gripping… creeping higher until, just as the limousine rolled to a stop, Agatha’s palm pressed firmly against her. Rio jolted, her hips bucking forward as her breath caught. Everything in her coiled as she chased the friction. Before she could speak, before could scold or whimper or plead, her wife had already pulled away, stepping out of the limo with the kind of smile that could make a cosmic entity fold. A soft, sweet thing that had no right belonging to a woman who had killed her with touch alone. </p><p>Rio cleared her throat, composed herself, and followed her wife out into the churn of the city. Noise crashed into her– car horns, shounting strangers, the hideous order that burned her nostrils. Right, this is why they both hated New York. But then her gaze lifted and the restaurant stood alive with color and music, every inch of its wooden exterior wrapped in blooms of pink, climbing vines wrapping it in its own type of love. Inside, almost every table was full, couples’ laughter blended in the rich, but soft Italien music that changed the ambience. For a moment Rio believed they were no longer in Lower Manhattan, but rather in Italy together, one of the legs of their honeymoon on their way to Greece. Inside, she could make out the floral energie and fuck, she was falling in love all over again with the woman before her.</p><p>Blue eyes glittering up at her, Rio’s heels exaggerating their high difference only by a little, but it was enough. Her wife stepped forward, her expression oddly soft as she fixed the lapels of Rio’s blazer. Rio’s own hands rested on her wife’s stomach, smiling as her wife then fixed her necklace before kissing her cheek with infuriating sweetness. Agatha took her left hand in hers, the lamps and little fire lights flickered around them, making their wedding bands sparkle together. A hostess held the door open for them, greeting them as they stepped in only to meet a line of couples waiting impatiently before the stand. At the front, a woman was arguing with the host– loud, nasal, righteous– a fucking Karen. </p><p>“For fuck’s sake,” Agatha breathed out a little too loudly, but it seemed that the people in front them agreed, letting out their own sighs as the Karen continued. </p><p>Rio drowned her out, stepping behind her wife and wrapping her arms around her waist. And for a flicker of a second, she remembered seeing something on TikTok about helping her wife while they were standing. Slowly, Rio pressed her body closer against her wife’s back, her hands moved underneath her stomach and lifted it slightly. Peering down at her wife, she watched as Agatha’s eyes closed in relief, her hands moving over hers as she took some of the strain off her wife’s lower back. Her head rested back on Rio’s shoulder, her lips forming something softer, away from the teasing from minutes ago. </p><p>But Rio should have known that wouldn’t last. No, her wife was a terror, a she-demon– a seductive succubus ready to eat her alive and Rio– her willing victim, who would welcome Death with open arms. Fuck, she would actually fight Death and make her trade places so she could have the succubus for eternity.</p><p>In life and in death, Agatha Harkness would be hers. </p><p>That teasing smirk crashed in hard, her wife not even bothering to hide it before Rio felt a subtle shift of her hips pressed back against hers. She sucked in breath, her body growing still as she continued to gently hold her wife’s stomach. Her wife didn’t stop. Pushing back against, her legs shifting where one her ass cheeks grinding right into her. On the outside, Rio looked like a tender wife, trying to help her pregnant wife who shifted uncomfortably– if anyone knew the truth? Her wife was truly a demon. </p><p>Rio leaned down, nuzzling her nose into her wife’s neck, taking in the fresh scent of lavender, basil, and something distinctly Agatha, “<em> Cariño, </em>if you keep this up, I will take you right here, against the host stand, in front of every bored couple in Lower Manhattan.” </p><p>Her wife only hummed, her eyebrow raising as they shuffled forward with the line, the Karen grumbling past them, muttering something about being a “paying customer.” But it fell on deaf ears as Agatha allowed her weight to fall a little more on her wife. </p><p>“Mmm, would you now?” she whispered, her lips now crazing her cheek, a picture of innocence. “Guess we’ll just have to find out if your thirty-fourth birthday is worth the misdemeanor.” </p><p>Rio groaned in defeat, shifting behind her wife to try to stop the pressure against her. But it was no use. Agatha was already winning, taking the high ground. So, she stayed there, taking the torture, but making sure her wife felt the little bit of relief from the pressure of their son. When they finally reached the stand, Agatha interlaced their fingers a little tighter as she lifted her head at the hostess. </p><p>“Reservation for two under Harkness-Vidal.” </p><p>The girl swallowed nervously, nodding quickly, “Of course, Mrs. Harkness-Vidal. Sorry for the wait. You can follow Matthew as he will be your waiter for tonight.” </p><p>A college student stepped forward, but Rio barely glanced at him, allowing her wife to pull out of her hold, keeping their hands locked together as they were led to a cozy corner, kissed by the flickering light of twin candles and the fragrant twist of lemon trees growing in pots nearby. To Rio’s shock, the table wasn’t like something Agatha would normally have them sat at. Her wife would normally have them seated side by side, but not as close as the one restaurant they went to made for couples in December. No, this table created a 36”x40” divide between them– flaunting something that Rio couldn’t directly touch or have in the moment. It was another ploy, another play– another way to leave Rio extra sexually frustrated. She held back a sigh as she moved before the waiter could, helping her wife sit down before taking her seat, a little more roughly than she should as she yanked out the chair, sitting across from the demon. The demon’s lips curled into that vixen grin as she sat back, both hands on her stomach, a painting of maternal grace as the waiter cleared his throat. </p><p>“Everything has been pre-ordered, yes?” </p><p>Her wife nodded, refusing to take her eyes off of her prey. Rio gulped nervously, wondering what her wife had done. Part of her wondered if she knew Rio would look at the menu, and try to estimate the time it would take before they were back in their hotel room. But maybe, <em> maybe, </em>if their order was already in place, time would go faster. </p><p>“And we are still going with the beverage choice of water? We have a nice white wine,” he turned to Rio and for a moment, Rio’s eyebrows raised in surprise as he only addressed her for alcohol. </p><p>“No, thank you,” she waved him off, but her wife cocked her head. </p><p>“My love,” her wife’s voice was fucking honey. “It’s your birthday, you should have wine if you want some.”</p><p>She shook her head, “<em> Mi amor, </em>we already made a deal– I don’t drink when you can’t.”</p><p>Her wife rolled her eyes as another waiter set bread, oil, and water down in front of them and they were left in the low light ambience. They reached forward in sync, Rio interlacing her left hand– her non-dominant hand– with Agatha’s right, her wife’s non-dominant hand. </p><p>“Happy birthday, my love,” Agatha’s voice was quiet, almost too quiet where the overlapping conversations made it hard to hear. </p><p>She was uncharacteristically soft for a moment, Rio couldn’t stop the bright smile that stretched her cheeks. She felt as if she was back on their first date, how nervous she was not to fuck it up, but also not able to stop staring at the woman who sat in her arms as she pointed out the stars. Their second date then became more vivid, and red threatened to give away the memory to her wife. Rio had taken her to a nice sushi restaurant, and for some reason, she was just as nervous as the first date. Rio had successfully embarrassed herself. She had tripped over her own feet, barely catching herself as Agatha had tried pretending not to notice, but she covered her mouth, holding back her laugh poorly. Then, Rio had spilled her tea everywhere, shattering the glass, sending boba all over the floor. Agatha had laughed– not the one with her favorite snort, but damn well close to it. </p><p>She laughed until her eyes shone like twin lapis catching in the firelight, and then without missing a beat, she had leaned across the table, taken Rio’s stained hand in her own, and said, <em> “Oh, you’re so cute when you’re flustered. </em>” </p><p>And Rio knew– had known right then and there, there was no turning back. Now, years later, Agatha held her again, differently and maybe even more tenderly. She was glowing from her pregnancy, her hair shining, more voluminous, running down the front of her chest. Her skin was clear, her lips laced with that knowing smile, as the free hand rubbed circles on her round stomach. The silence between them wasn’t silent. It was laced and brimming with a love that grew over the years between the chaos they had faced, the nights where they laid together too exhausted for sleep, but unable to talk– just holding each other, and to the nights where their bodies told each other how much they loved the other. </p><p>Rio swallowed, trying to remember how to breathe under the weight of her wife’s gaze. Her wife was studying her, but that glint had never left, and despite the aching, loving moment between them– Rio knew the succubus was lurking. </p><p>“You’re plotting,” she whispered. </p><p>Her wife’s lips curled into that siren’s smile, eyes half-lidded and wickedly amused, “Always.” Agatha took her hand back, reaching for her glass of water. “Almost ten years of marriage, my love– fifteen years of being together. I have to keep you on your toes.” </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, going to reach for her own glass, before something made her freeze. She looked up, watching her wife drink, both of them forgoing the plastic straws. A stream of water ran from her wife’s chin. Time slowed for a moment, and Rio watched as it dripped from her sharp chin, down her check, just a hair away from the red lipstick mark still staining her neck and down defined collarbones. She was entranced, almost as if she was a kid in the backseat of a car, betting which of the two raindrops would win the race down the window. But this was only one, and she wondered how reasonable it was to be jealous of the water that caressed her wife’s chest before running right between her breasts. Her wife raised a knowing eyebrow at her as Rio cleared her throat, unable to tear her eyes away as Agatha took a napkin, reaching into her dress to dry it. </p><p><em> Mierda, she is trying to kill me </em>, Rio thought as her tongue pushed against the inside of her cheek. </p><p>Before either of them could speak again, their first course arrived– two plates placed in front of them with the food looking more like art than for dining. It was a small portion, and Rio figured– and hoped– that there would be another course… but she also regretted it. Because it meant more time in the restaurant– more time waiting to take her wife to bed. </p><p>“For you, our <em> ravioli di crostacei </em> – lobster, crab, salmon filled ravioli mixed in our special saffron sauce,” the waiter smiled before turning to her wife. “And the <em> gnocchetti di patate </em>: potato gnocchi, gorgonzola sauce, and arugula– completely cooked as requested, Mrs. Harkness-Vidal. I will be back with your second course later.” </p><p><em> Great </em> , <em> there was a second course </em>. </p><p>But then Rio finally registered what he said, the meal– it was something Rio had mentioned in passing about craving months ago– reminiscing of the time she had it in Italy with her wife, and Agatha, of course, had remembered. She blinked at the plate, her throat tightening. </p><p>“You really didn’t have to do all of this,” she murmured, her voice quiet. </p><p>Agatha took her hand again, “Of course I did. It’s your birthday and we are about to have a baby. What else were you expecting?” </p><p>Rio huffed as slid the food in her mouth, humming at the taste as her heart fluttered, “A quiet dinner. Maybe some cake.” </p><p>“Oh, <em> there’ll </em> be cake,” her wife smirked. “But it won’t be the kind you eat with a fork.” </p><p>Rio <em> choked, </em>her body stiffened as she tried forcing the ravioli down. Her wife just lifted her glass like it was a fluke of champagne in a toast, feigning innocence like a devout nun. Rio hit her chest, swallowing harshly as her wife just smirked, and they knew this game was far from over. </p><p>Blue eyes glinted at her, like a sapphire as the main jewel of a necklace– sharp, flashy, and something mystical– enough to allure someone close. She set her glass down with the grace of a predator wrapped in silk, already knowing all the weak points of her prey and reached for her utensils, fingers curling around the fork like she was plucking a forbidden fruit. </p><p><em> “Cariño, </em>” Rio murmured, meaning to scold her wife, but it came out as a plea. </p><p> Her wife didn’t look up, only focused on her food– but her eyes told a different story. Her lashes low, her eyes hooded as she deliberately dragged the edge of the spoon down her plate, gathering the round gnocchi and sauce into a neat display upon it. She took a bite, a soft noise leaving her lips that belonged more to the bedroom than it did dinner. Rio squeezed her legs unconsciously, swallowing hard as she stared wide eyed at her wife, watching as a drip of the gorgonzola gathered at the corner of her wife’s lips. Taking her pointer finger and wiping the dot, her tongue circled the tip of her finger, those azure eyes locked on hers before she took her finger completely in her mouth, her cheeks hollowing as she sucked. </p><p>Rio stared, unable to tear her gaze away, watching those lips before a loud clatter silenced the restaurant, startling herself as the fork in her hand bounced off her plate and rattled on the tile floor. Her face heated in an instant as her wife chuckled under her breath, a waiter already handing her a clean fork and taking the one from the floor as the chatter started up again. </p><p>“Are you alright, sweetheart?” fingers tangled with hers, stopping her from burying her face into her hands to hide from the world. </p><p>She pushed her tongue against her cheek with a chuckle, “You’re evil.”</p><p>Her wife scoffed at her, “I haven’t even started, darling.”</p><p>“Agatha,” she groaned, picking at her food. </p><p>Her wife went back to eating, shrugging, “I’m pregnant and it’s your birthday. We can have a little fun.”</p><p>Rio fought the roll of her eyes, but they wandered back to her wife’s plate, watching as Agatha played with the sauce. Her eyes watching the thick off-white cream drip back onto the plate before taking a couple more bites. Then, she sighed, her eyes looking out over the table as if she was deep in thought, but Rio knew better– forcing the last couple bites of food down, needing this meal.</p><p>“You know,” she started softly. “This sauce is incredible. I read reviews on the menu before booking–” </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio warned, but her wife ignored her. </p><p>“And what were the words they used?” she tapped a long finger on her chin. “Creamy, bold… sinful. Reminds me of those nights in Greece on our honeymoon, if you remember.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw went slack as the images hit her right in her core. </p><p>“Specifically that night where we were standing, watching the waves, the moon just hiding from the clouds–” Agatha’s voice dipped low, and sultry, a whisper Rio could just hear over the music “– and I bent you right over that railing. You took me so well.” </p><p>She forgot where they were, what day it was, what her name was as her wife slowly crossed her legs, both hands on her stomach as she leaned back like a poised queen in her velvet chair. Saving Rio from whatever godless thing her wife was about to say next, their waiter arrived, taking their plates. At least, she thought he saved her as her wife laced their fingers again, forming a picture of wedded bliss. But then, her wife began tracing slow, rhythmic circles over the pulse in her wrist. It was small, gentle even– but so utterly maddening. </p><p>“How was everything ladies?” he asked, completely unaware that Rio couldn’t meet his gaze. </p><p>“It was good, thanks,” her wife dismissed him. </p><p>He nodded his head, “Your second course will be right out, and for the dessert, any changes to the order before we start prepping?” </p><p>Her wife shook her head, “No, everything the way it was ordered.” </p><p>The waiter nodded again, before heading back to the kitchen. Rio swallowed hard as her wife lifted her glass again, taking a long sip before he was back again, laying a plate in front of Rio. It was a larger portion, something to fill her, a large mix of seafood that Rio loved. </p><p>“The <em> zuppa di pesce </em> for you, Mrs. Harkness-Vidal. This is a delicate seafood mix with garlic and fine herbs in a spicy tomato broth,” he said before laying another plate in front of her wife. “And for you, the <em> braciola di maiale </em> : grilled pork chop, corn all in a golden apple and mushroom sauce. Enjoy.” </p><p>She flared her nostrils, breathing harshly out before taking another breath in. One more course and dessert. She could do it. Anything else her wife threw at her couldn’t be that bad… right? </p><p>Wrong. </p><p>Agatha uncrossed and recrossed her legs as she played with her food, “Where were we darling? Right, how you were bent over the railing, taking my cock–” </p><p>Rio choked again. The words went right to her core as her eyes grew wide, staring at her wife. She was frozen, her breathing heavy as her thoughts unraveled with every syllable her succubus of a wife purred. </p><p>“Agatha,” she hissed this time, but there was no strength in her voice. “You can’t say that here.” </p><p>Her wife just shrugged– a picture of nonchalance, as if her own words weren’t affecting her too. Rio always knew her wife could be an actress. She was manipulative, cunning, and as sly as a fox when she wanted something, no matter how it affected her. It was one of many reasons Rio fell in love with her. </p><p>“Okay, my love. I won’t say another word, for now.” </p><p>Her shoulders relaxed. She could breathe– get through this last course and then dessert. And then somehow she would need to make it through this restaurant, back in the limo, and then through the hotel lobby without that misdemeanor. </p><p>Alas, Rio was indeed a fool. A lovestruck fool for the woman across from her. </p><p>Agatha struck the moment Rio’s shoulders fell and as she was digging into the seafood, picking up an empty mussel shell to use to eat the others. Just as the shell pulled the meat from the other, Agatha’s foot, slow and featherlike, brushed against her ankle. It was innocent. A need for touch between them that never made her blink before, but then, it didn’t stop. The silk touch of skin moved up her leg, wrapping around her calf, dragging along the muscle. </p><p>Her eyes fluttered shut for a half-second before snapping open, her throat dry, “<em> Cariño, por favor– ¿qué estás haciendo?”  </em></p><p>She dropped the shells back into the broth as her wife’s foot sent sparks into her skin. Her wife continued eating, as if her foot wasn’t caressing Rio’s knee before rubbing along the seam of her inner thigh. </p><p>Agatha swallowed, “You look a little flushed, sweetheart. Is it too spicy?” </p><p>“Fuck you,” she gritted her teeth as the spark in her wife’s eyes grew. </p><p>“Or,” Agatha purred, meeting her gaze now, “maybe you’re just… <em> remembering.” </em></p><p>The last word came out syrupy thick, sweet, and slow. The arch of her brow, the curl of her lips– fuck, her eyes, the way the gown wrapped around her wife’s pregnant figure– it was music, poetry, and death all wrapped into one being. And Rio? She was the lone soldier, losing herself to the demon of seduction before her. Her wife’s foot shifted more, nudging against her thigh before Rio caught it. </p><p>“Agatha, <em> por favor– </em>” </p><p>Rio was so ready to wipe the smirk from her wife’s face. </p><p>“Begging already, my love?”</p><p>Her teeth were grinding with how tight her jaw was clenching, trying to temper down the burning in her veins. But Agatha knew it was only a matter of time. Of course she did. </p><p>Rio hissed at her, her voice low enough for only her wife to hear, “Begging? You keep going and dessert’s going to come second to bending you over this table.” </p><p>Agatha’s pupils blew wide, but the smirk remained as her eyebrow raised, “So the misdemeanor will be worth it then?” </p><p>It took everything in her not to lunge over the table at her wife. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b>***</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Rio barely held through as they ate, well, she was inhaling her food, needing them to get out of there. Her legs were pressed together and she really, <em> really </em> hoped her pants were dark enough. At least the low lighting helped in the restaurant, as long as no one looked at them in the hotel. When dessert came out, her wife was in the bathroom, their son still deciding it wasn’t the time to sleep. She hoped he did sleep during the night, especially if her wife let her take control, which she doubted. The dessert was a berry tart, the cream piled high and the berries perfect. She asked for a box, trying to get ahead of her wife, unable to sit there any longer.</p><p>“Of course, Mrs. Harkness-Vidal, and everything is already paid for,” the waiter smiled as he eased the large tart into the box. </p><p>“Thank you,” Rio nodded, finally able to speak like a regular human being instead of one being trapped under the spell of a witch. </p><p>Rio grabbed the box and her wife’s purse just as small heels clicked up behind her. She turned, staring down into smoldering blue eyes. A slender eyebrow raised as Rio took off her blazer, draping it over her wife’s shoulders as Agatha stared up at her, her lips parting, just slightly. It was a moment of softness in the thrill of heat. Rio helped her wife slide her arms through the sleeves, fixing the lapels of the blazer before resting her hands on her wife’s stomach, waiting for a kick, but finding an easy steadiness beneath. Their son was finally asleep, giving some relief to her wife. </p><p>“You’re such a gentleman,” her wife murmured, her voice smoky, smoldering– a heat that travelled up Rio’s spine. </p><p>“I’m trying to be,” she replied, grabbing the box before taking her wife’s hand and nearly dragging her out. “You make it difficult.” </p><p>Her wife laughed as they breezed by the hostess stand and out into the cold air. But it didn’t bother Rio, in fact it made the heat worse as her wife pulled out her phone, texting the limo. </p><p>“I will say it is rather rude you ended dinner so fast. I still have your real gift in my purse,” Agatha’s words turned quiet, nervous almost. </p><p>So Rio turned, capturing her wife’s lips quickly, “Tomorrow, <em> cariño. </em>Not that I don’t appreciate it, but you have been killing me for a week straight.” </p><p>Her nervous expression turned into something darker, blue eyes were hooded from thick eyelashes, pupils dilated, as the wicked smirk came back. </p><p>The limo was so far the worst part. Rio had to hold her wife’s hand in place so she didn’t slip her hand between her legs and tease her. She had bolted out the moment the limo stopped, dragging her wife behind her to the elevator where Rio wanted to scream. Another couple, with two kids, joined them and they both had to behave as the couple smiled at them, the mother seeming to want to talk to her pregnant wife, but Agatha wrapped herself around Rio. To their luck, they got off on the sixteenth floor. So, no traumatized children… just the bunny. </p><p>

<b>Agatha </b>
</p><p> </p><p>Lips trailed down her neck, her breath catching as her hips rolled over the leg between her thighs. Her whole body was vibrating, humming– practically screaming for the mad woman against her. She didn’t bother to correct her wife when she felt harsh sucking, no, she only melted against the door, her own body betraying her as Rio marked her neck. She moaned softly, clinging to her wife as hand rested on her hips, keeping her steady as everything felt like with Rio like this– possessive, desperate, and in control… well not for long. </p><p>Agatha straighted, pushing on her wife’s chest. She walked her backwards, both of them somehow slipping out of their shoes as they went until she pushed Rio down on the bed. Dark brown eyes stared up at her, pupils blown, and her tongue poking at the side of cheek for a moment before hands were on her stomach. </p><p>“Strip and wait for me. If you touch yourself, I’ll know, darling,” she husked as she caressed her wife’s jaw. “I have a gift you will be unwrapping tonight.”</p><p>With that, she pushed on Rio’s chest, sending her flat on her back, making her chuckle as Agatha made her way to the bathroom. Scratchy was already curled up in the makeshift pen Rio made. She added water and some carrots to his bowls before muttering an apology, knowing they were going to wake the poor rabbit up. At least for now, he could sleep. </p><p>Agatha unzipped her dress, letting it pool to the floor along with the rest of her clothes before her eyes snapped up to the mirror. She bit her lip as the excitement pooling within her turned anxious. Her body was so different, in a matter of two weeks, she was huge in comparison. Her breasts and even her nipples themselves were swollen. They have already leaked, staining the breast pads– and there was some form of disappointment that her wife will not be playing with them like usual. Rio loved her tits, always touching them or sucking on them, but now they were growing for their son. She knew the moment she stopped lactating, her wife would be all over them once more. But what concerned her, was how big both her stomach and breasts were. They had faint webs of stretch marks all over them and her belly button was starting to pop out. Her hips lost that curve to her and now her ass looked weird in her eyes. Gods, would her wife even be attracted to her anymore? </p><p>She always flaunted her body, especially during the early days with Rio. Fuck, Rio was a fucking simp for her– she swore multiple times she caught her drooling. But she was different now. She was heavy, slower, and she would be lying if she didn’t admit that of course Rio acknowledged how easily out of breath she was getting. Carrying their son was everything, but at this moment… after two weeks… would Rio even find her attractive? She had this argument with herself before, and each time Rio proved she was still the same simp as she was in college. But this felt heavier. It felt more real. And holding up the purple and green lingerie set, she wasn’t sure she could give Rio what she wanted to. </p><p>She took an unsteady breath in, realizing she couldn’t disappoint her wife on her birthday, on the fact that she had mercilessly teased Rio all day and also the whole week. If Rio didn’t want her… she shook out of those thoughts, not able to bear it as she slipped the lace up her legs, adjusting the forest green strings around her hips with the buckle. She loosened them enough, thanking the gods for telling her to order a custom set like this. The panties were all green, lace, and sheer. The lace were delicate works of florals, while the sheer stretched in between the lace. Wiry curls peaked out through it, something that made her wife always go wild. The panties themselves were V-shaped, little bows on her hips with charms that dangle down against her thighs, ending in amethyst tear drops, and the back a single thin lace string that disappeared between her cheeks, leaving her bare. She would have to remind her wife not to rip them. The garter belt was next, but as she moved it up her thigh, she realized that even her thighs changed. She let it fall to the ground, trying not to pay attention to it as she reached into her bag, retrieving the final touch. </p><p>The bra was delicate and didn’t hide much. There was no sheer netting between the lace in them, only open skin, and the only lace were the azaleas that barely covered her nipples. Her breasts spilled from it as she worked to loosen the straps so they wouldn’t dig… not that should have this on for long, but her hands trembled. When the straps were comfortable, she risked her gaze into the mirror. She bit her lip, unsure. It was different… sure her usual boldness, but goddess, she was so scared. Her mind was running and the door loomed over her, daring her to cross its threshold. With one last trembling deep breath, she reached for the handling, turning it open slowly before stepping out, finding the lights already set low enough to create the atmosphere needed. She turned the corner and there her wife was, sitting on the edge of the bed, swinging her legs, wearing nothing but her <em> Plants VS Zombie </em> boxers. She married a fucking dork… an incredibly hot, intelligent dork. </p><p>The moment those brown puppy-dog eyes landed on her, they grew impossibly dark. Rio’s body froze, her legs stopped in mid motion as her jaw hung open as Agatha approached slowly, swaying her hips. The amethysts gently tapped the side of her thighs with every step as Rio looked starstruck. Okay, maybe Agatha was being a little dramatic about her own appearance… and now Rio was actually drooling. </p><p>Yep, still a fucking simp. </p><p>“Happy birthday, Mrs. Harkness-Vidal,” she purred as she drew closer. </p><p>Her wife finally closed her mouth, quickly wiping the drool away as if she didn’t even register it… she definitely wasn’t registering that fact that she wasn’t breathing normally. Rio’s chest rose and fell harshly as hands gripped the quilt underneath her. Agatha smirked, her confidence boosting as she climbed into Rio’s lap. Her thighs landed on either side of her wife’s, and then warm hands were on her hips, lifting her and settling her closer until her belly was resting against her wife’s. She traced her hands up and down strong shoulders, her eyes catching the wisps of ink from the back tattoo. She followed the shape of muscle on her shoulders to the vines around her collarbones, glancing slightly down at her ink covered biceps before moving to her wife’s face. Black hair cascaded down like silk curtains, framing those perfect cheeks that she sometimes liked to pinch, and down to her jawline. Rio’s eyes were hooded, entirely focused on her chest as she could feel the gaze undressing her already. </p><p>Agatha’s hands found Rio’s cheeks, firm and certain, coaxing her wife’s face upward until their eyes locked. That look– gods, that look– searing and soft, born of too many yesterdays and aching with all the tomorrows still to come. But the stillness shattered quickly. Rio closed the space between them like a wave crashing into shore, their lips meeting in a kiss that had been a decade and a half in the making– measured, familiar, a language they spoke fluently in silence. It began gently, a worship of mouths. A practice of their language as the fire sparked to life.</p><p>The fire was slow, a tame thing, lighting first in their combined lips, but fire is a gluttonous thing. And the control between them wavered, allowing the fire to grow until a wildfire bloomed, burning every fiber in Agatha’s being. </p><p>Rio tilted her head, her teeth catching on Agatha’s lower lip, spreading the fire to ignite nerve and bone. Agatha gasped, mouth parting in surrender, and her wife devoured the moment of weakness– her tongue sweeping in, slow and measured. She moaned against her, her hips now grounding down in desperation, searching for friction, riding the rough cotton of Rio’s boxers. Each mouvement more desperate than the last– deeper, slower– strong hands guiding her as each perfect grind sent the wildfire in a frenzy. Tongues tangled, dueling with each, clashing teeth, and smearing and spilling spit. Rio’s hands gripped her hips harder, a silent plea that surged straight to her core. But she resisted, needing her wife even more desperate– chasing something so wild and wicked and worshipful. </p><p>And then it struck her– the controlled spark. </p><p>She pulled back, barely, breath ragged, their mouths close enough that every exhale merged as one. They panted together like caged animals, breathing in each other’s wants, while Rio’s hands wandered, careful but rough– one cradling her pregnant belly as the other squeezed hard enough to leave a mark on her ass. Agatha’s eyes sparkled as her fingers curled under Rio’s chin, lifting her head back as she rose over her wife, claiming her spot like a regal queen. Her wife’s mouth opened on its own, rich brown soil eyes hooded, pupils so large that it looked like an endless black hole. Agatha gathered the spit in her mouth, letting it fall like a spider’s thread into Rio’s waiting mouth. Her wife took it wordlessly, eyes fluttering shut as she swallowed it without hesitation, without shame, without disgust… only eternal devotion. A long manicured nail of her pointer finger tapped on Rio’s cheek, just under her eye, getting them to open again. </p><p>When Rio looked at her, it was like staring at a storm in space, thunder caught behind lashes, dark clouds circling, spelling out something more profound. Agatha leaned in, her fingers soothing the skin as her eyes flickered over her wife’s face. </p><p>“I want you to feel me,” she breathed. “Coating every inch of your mouth. Dripping down your throat. I want you to know– before I even lay a hand on you– that I’m already inside you.”</p><p>She let more spill, saliva pooling behind her lips, then let it pour slowly into Rio’s mouth, a thick drop sliding down, striking the back of her wife’s throat like a spell cast in flesh and salt. A final thread clung between them, then broke, landing wet and warm on Rio’s bottom lip. Rio swallowed again– and then she <em> shuddered </em>. </p><p>It was <em> that </em> shudder. </p><p>Agatha knew it like her own name. The one that made Rio gasp, made her eyes roll back, and her spine arc toward her. A whimper filled the space between them as hands grabbed her hips, searching for something to anchor herself to as the sharp stillness of her body caused another whimper from her lips. Agatha held her through it, her thumbs stroking her cheeks, grounding her wife as her own eyes widened in disbelief. The breath left her body as she watched her wife take her time until brown eyes weakly opened, hazy, fogged with pleasure and glossy with that perfect afterglow. Then– recognition. Embarrassment. Her cheeks flushed a soft honey-gold as she stared at Agatha wide-eyed. </p><p>She blinked her lips parting, “Did… did you just…?” </p><p>Rio groaned a curse in Spanish, dragging her hands up to cover her face before falling back against the mattress mortified. She buried her eyes beneath trembling fingers as she continued to catch her breath. </p><p>Agatha stared down at her wife, catching herself with her hands on Rio’s hips. Then she felt it. A wetness that wasn’t hers against her thighs. Rio had come <em> hard </em>. And that very thought grew her own arousal. She moved forward, grabbing a pillow from the bed and dropping it behind her. Her wife was still coming down, still trembling with the aftershocks… and probably the mortification that she had just come untouch– had come from spit alone. Agatha questioned why she was ever self conscious of her body at that point. Her wife truly was wrapped around her finger– well, not yet physically. </p><p>She moved off her body with zero grace, the new weight leaving her off balanced, but she made it work as she knelt on the pillow at Rio’s feet. She ripped the boxers off Rio’s legs and tossed them behind her without care. And before her wife could react, she was spreading apart muscular thighs, staring at her prize with a shaky breath. Rio was soaked, her arousal and cum covering the black wiry hairs and the bed was very much soaked underneath her. She was swollen, pink peeking out from the hair, and clit aching for attention. Her scent was already flooding her lungs– earthy, rich, tangy with lust– and it made her dizzy with her own gluttonous desires. </p><p>She hooked her arms beneath Rio’s hips, pulling her closer as Rio let out a surprised squeak. Agatha couldn’t wait. It had been two weeks since she last tasted her wife, and fuck, her own mouth was watering at the sight now mere inches from her face. She didn’t give her wife a second to react, her head dipping forward, tongue flicking out to taste the fruits of her labor… or lack of labor. But nonetheless hers. It was hot, rich, and sweet– the flavor of Rio– of love. She couldn’t stop the moan in her throat, the sound vibrating against swollen lips as she parted them with her tongue, lapping up everything with fever. Rio moaned loudly above her, thighs tightening together against her head before bucking against her mouth. Her cries were strangled, muted as she thrashed. </p><p>“Let me hear you, birthday girl,” she pulled away only to husk that before latching to Rio’s clit, each suck soothed by the flick of her tongue. </p><p>She lifted her fingers, moving under her chin as Rio’s pussy swallowed one and then two without resistance. She pumped them into her, her tongue teasing and circling with a rhythm that was patient and practiced. Her wife needed more, she could tell. Agatha pulled away, withdrawing her fingers causing a loud displeased whine as she brought her pointer finger up to her mouth. Acrylics be damned. It didn’t matter that she just had them done. She bit down hard on the nail, popping the nail off with ease before doing the same with her pinky. She glanced at them, making sure nothing was there before her mouth parted lips again, taking in everything her wife had to offer. Her fingers slid in again, this time a third finger making Rio keen before sliding in her pinky. </p><p>Rio was babbling above her, broken Spanish, but it was muffled from her thighs and jerking hips. A hand buried in Agatha’s hair, pulling as if that could ground her to this realm, to this earth, to this bed. And still, Agatha worked her– mouth slick with her wife’s cum, chin, lips, and nose glistening, four fingers inside her, curling them to hit that spongy spot deep inside her wife. The noises were sinfully wet, filling the room, most likely echoing out into the hall… definitely waking Señor Scratchy. Rio cried out, her body arching, thighs trembling on either side as the second wave built. </p><p>“Yes,” Agatha whispered to her, speaking directly against her cunt. “That’s it, my love. Give it to me.” </p><p>Another moan, another loud cry, and another tremor. Rio was unravelling, faster this time, the first orgasm making her soft as clay, molding her under Agatha’s attention. Her walls clenched around Agatha’s fingers, her breath was ragged, and then– she shattered. Her back bowed, the cry ripped from her very throat– raw and brutal. She held her through it, cum flooding her mouth, drenching her hand, and dripping down her wrist as she slowed her thrusts. Her tongue moved, soothing now as she drank her wife like it was her last drink of water on earth. </p><p>When Rio stilled, when her legs went slack and her body collapsed on the mattress, Agatha pulled her face away. She kissed her thigh softly, her lips dancing over the quaking muscle, a soft tell that she was about to pull her fingers out. She did slowly, her wife whimpering softly until she was empty with a loud wet pop. Agatha took her fingers in her mouth, refusing to waste any of it. She sucked loudly on them, knowing that Rio knew what she was doing before she placed her hands on Rio’s thighs, using them to lift herself off the ground. She crawled back in her wife’s lap, smirking down at her, as Rio’s eyes remained closed. She sat there for a moment, taking her wife in, her eyes travelling the tattoos before focusing on where Rio was hurt. The tattoo wasn’t too badly messed up, but enough where the ribs looked off, no longer straight. With a shaky hand, her fingertips grazed over, what would be pink, fresh scar. The stomach beneath her sucked in and for a split second, Agatha thought she hurt her, until a soft chuckle echoed in the room. </p><p>Right, Rio was ticklish there.</p><p>Agatha hummed with her, now leaning over her wife, hands on either side of her head as she held her belly up, refusing to put any weight on it as she kissed her wife’s lips. Fingers tucked her hair back, a hand moving to aid her, holding onto her hip as they kissed slowly and sweet, Rio licking into her mouth and tasting herself. They pulled away to catch their breaths, her wife guiding them into an upright position as Agatha practically preened above her. </p><p>“So–”</p><p>“<em> Mis dioses, </em>” her wife groaned. “Agatha.” </p><p>She chuckled, holding her wife’s face so she couldn’t hide, “You came with only my spit in your mouth.”</p><p>“A token of my appreciation,” she joked, but Agatha saw right through her. </p><p>She was nervous, mortified still– as if her dropping to her knees and eating her out wasn’t even enough to tell her how hot that was. Taking her wife’s hand, she lifted up, guiding it around her belly, and down between her legs. Her voice grew hushed, with promise and devotion. </p><p>“Feel what you do to me,” she murmured, her nose brushing against hers. “Feel how wet that made me.”</p><p>Fingers brushed against the soaked lace as their eyes pinned each other in place. Rio gasped, not in surprise– not entirely, but in awe. Agatha brought her hands to her wife’s shoulders, hanging on as fingers moved, a hand cupping her before fingers moved up to clit, rubbing in careful circles. Agatha moaned softly, gripping onto her wife harder as her skilled fingers worked against her. Rio leaned forward, lips and teeth nipping at her jaw before they all pulled away. Agatha blinked, staring down, uncertain now. Rio moved back on her elbows, moving until her head hit the mattress just before the pillows. Reaching forward, Agatha took her hand, struggling to move on her knees on the bed as it dipped with each movement. Hands were on her hips, guiding her forward still and something flashed in Agatha’s eyes, freezing them both. </p><p>“Rio,” she breathed. “It’s your birthday. Let me make you feel good.” </p><p>Her wife tilted her head in that infuriating playful way. </p><p>“You do, <em>mi reina. </em>And what I want now” she purred “is for you to take your throne.”<br/>Agatha snorted, shaking her head as her hands moved up and down her wife’s chest. She pinched lightly at a nipple, making Rio bite her lip as she tried to pull her onto her face. Agatha hesitated again, making Rio sit up on her elbows. </p><p>“<em> Mi amor, ¿qué tienes?” </em>she spoke softly. </p><p>She froze at her words, staring down into worrisome brown eyes. She couldn’t answer for  a moment, but relaxed the moment a hand was caressing her stomach. It was soft, a careful acknowledgement of the fear that flew through Agatha’s eyes. She was larger, heavier, and round with child. How could Rio want her to sit on her face? She tilted her head in confirmation, needing to hear Rio say she wanted this– that she wasn’t too heavy. </p><p>Her hand never left her belly– the sacred swell between them– made from scratch and love, was caressed with reverence. Her thumb swept in soothing arcs just beneath her navel, grounding and centering her. </p><p>“<em> Cariño,” </em>she said, her voice low and firm, as if her voice itself could cast a spell of lavender and chamomile, easing her swirling thoughts. “Look at me.”</p><p>She did, and there in those mahogany depths, was no judgment, no doubt, or question. It was only hungry threaded so deep with love that was so certain, it nearly undid her. </p><p>“You’re not too heavy,” she said, drawing her closer by her hips, fingers splayed across skin. “You are divine– a goddess. You are <em> mine </em> . You are carrying <em> our </em> son. What could be more powerful?”  </p><p>Agatha’s breath stuttered out of her, something like a gasp, sob, and laugh all in one. </p><p>“You always say the right thing,” she murmured, leaning forward and taking her wife’s lips. “It’s not fair.” </p><p>Rio scoffed, smiling into the kiss, “Nothing about <em> you </em> has ever been fair, <em> mi amor. </em>” </p><p>It earned her a breathless laugh from Agatha as she reached to cradle her jaw, thumb brushing against her lips. Then she shifted her weight with care, her wife helping her as knees straddled either side of Rio’s head. </p><p>“Now,” her wife husked. “<em> Sit </em>.”</p><p>Agatha gasped as her body was guided downward, her palms braced on the headboard behind Rio. She gripped hard, moaning already as fingers dug into her thighs, keeping her completely seated, all of her weight bearing on her wife. She looked down, expecting to meet Rio’s eyes, but her stomach was in the way. Her hips jerked as her wife licked her through the lace, and then Rio’s hand was moving, reaching for her panties. </p><p>“Rio,” she moaned, trying to tell her wife not to do what she was about to do. </p><p>A loud tear echoed with her moans, the fabric now leaving her bare for her wife’s mouth. </p><p>“Fuck– Rio! Those were new,” she growled, but her wife only hummed into her, the vibration hitting her core as something hot and wet dipped inside her. </p><p>Her wife hummed in response, her tongue leaving her to lick long slow stripes that made Agatha’s grip tighter on the headboard. </p><p>“<em> Mierda,” </em>Rio muttered into her cunt. “You taste better than I remember.” </p><p>She tried to laugh– tried to speak– but her mouth only opened to let her moans pour out. Her thighs shook where Rio gripped them, holding her open wide, and keeping her in place on her mouth. Every flick of her wife’s tongue, every careful suck, and featherlike graze of her teeth sent jolts up her spine, and when her wife took her clit into her mouth, she saw constellations. </p><p>“Rio– fuck– please– let me-let me move,” Agatha gasped, trying and failing to lift her hips. </p><p>“No,” a growl rumbled beneath her. “You don’t need to. Just let me eat.”</p><p>And gods, did she. </p><p>Rio’s tongue was merciless– languid and deep one second, then flicking fast and tight the next, dragging every breathless cry from Agatha’s throat. Fingers kneaded into her thighs, possessive and tender all at once. She was babbling now, tears down her cheeks as Rio chased her high for her. The nails on her right hand– the ones she hadn’t bit off– were scratching the wood as her other hand reached down, cradling her own stomach. She choked on a moan when Rio’s tongue went deep inside her, curling before licking back to her clit, taking it in her mouth and sucking hard. </p><p>“Rio–” she choked, voice cracking as her thighs continued to shake. “Fuck-fuck–” </p><p>She gasped, feeling a sharp knick of teeth to her clit. The pressure was building in her lower stomach, a tight coil that was threatening to break as each flick of her tongue graced her. She knew what it meant and she knew her wife was going to be soaked. </p><p>“Rio-Rio– I’m gonna– fuck– I’m coming– I’m coming–” </p><p>She chanted until it was just Rio’s name. White exploded behind her eyes as her orgasm tore through her body– hot, wet, and endless. She bucked once, then again, barely held down by the firm grip of her wife’s hands. She screamed, hoarse and glorious, body going taunt as her cunt pulsed against Rio’s mouth. And Rio… she groaned like it was a gift just for her… a birthday gift. </p><p>Agatha swore she must have blacked out, because when she finally opened her eyes, her head was tucked underneath her wife’s chin, face buried in her neck. A soothing hand was on her stomach and her panties were completely off her body. She lifted her head slowly, staring down into brown eyes that were smirking at her. Rio’s face was covered with her, glistening with slickness and when she went to kiss her, all she could taste and smell was herself. She licked into Rio’s mouth, humming at the taste before allowing more spit to trail into her mouth, but her wife just chuckled. </p><p>“I don’t think you are going to get me to come again with your spit alone.” </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, “Don’t act all smug, my love. You still came untouched, perv.” </p><p>Rio laughed for real this time, something soft that echoed like a summer storm in the distance– warm and thunderous all at once, shaking Agatha right down to the bone. Her wife pulled her closer, caressing her cheek, their eyes speaking their own language as it grew quiet again. </p><p>Her wife broke it softly, “Are you tired, <em> mi vida </em>?”</p><p>She snorted, “Cute, but no.” </p><p>Agatha moved off of her wife, moving back to the bathroom where she had her bag. She heard Rio sit up, her eyes burning a hole into her as they followed her to the bathroom. She grabbed the green toy from on top, smirking as she moved back into the bedroom. </p><p>“I have another gift, my love,” she smirked as Rio’s jaw dropped again. </p><p>In her palms rested the toy, vibrant and bold, its surface glistening under the low bedroom light. It was a deep, enchanted green, smooth, sleek, and slightly curved on the longer end of it– exactly six inches. There was a curve closer to the end, soft to the touch, something to nestle against Rio’s clit, and on the other end– it was shorter, bulbous and meant to nestle inside. It was made for her wife, molded for her body. She knew how it would sit within her wife– how this end would rest deep, kissing that soft, tender spot, ridged to grind against her walls as she moved.  </p><p>With a crook of her finger, she motioned for her wife to stand– she practically scrambled, hands on her hips as Rio didn’t leave her gaze from the toy.</p><p>“You’ll wear it,” Agatha said softly, her voice low and velvet, laced with possession. “You’ll feel me every time you move.” </p><p>She watched as her wife swallowed hard, her throat bobbing as she nodded like a woman possessed. Agatha kissed her lips slowly, distracting her as the kiss heated. Hands travelled up her body, Rio undoing her bra with one hand before hands were squeezing her boobs, a finger rolling over a hardened nipple, making Agatha groan low. Rio’s mouth descended, mouthing at her skin, kissing along her breasts and marking them as her hands pinched at her nipples. Impatiently, she pulled her wife back, kissing her jaw. </p><p>“Do you want lube?” she asked quietly, staring up at her. </p><p>Rio shook her head, a lazy smile etching on her lips as she took the toy, “Pick your position, <em> mi amor. </em>”  </p><p>Agatha flashed her a smirk as she crawled onto the bed on her hands and knees where she patiently waited. She heard a slight moan from her wife, a wet sound of the toy moving inside her before she felt hands holding her hips. </p><p>“Tell me when you need to move, <em> mi amor. </em>We can’t put pressure on your stomach,” her wife leaned over, kissing her back as the toy slipped between her thighs.</p><p>She moaned low in her throat, feeling the drag between her folds, dragging wetness up her slit, teasing her clit before slipping lower. She arched into the sensation, her knees spreading further apart, offering herself up to her wife with a hunger so bold it could kill. She swore and hissed as the head nudged slightly inside her, and then it slid in slowly, obscenely. Their moans harmonized as the toy stretched Agatha and her fingers clawed at the sheets. Fuck it was perfect– customed made for both of them. Something so it would fill both her <em> and </em>her wife. Her wife moaned behind her, hips twitching as the toy rubbed along her own clit with every slow push into Agatha’s soaked cunt. </p><p>Her wife’s voice was breathless as hands drew her back,” You’re so fucking tight, <em> mi amor. </em>Gods, you’re swallowing it.” </p><p>Agatha shuddered, her body grinding back to meet each thrust as she panted, “That’s the point. It’s yours. I’m yours. Use me.”</p><p>Something flipped in her wife, the control being transferred to Rio. Her hips snapped harder, the toy plunging deep– so deep Agatha’s cry pitched into a sharp whimper. She could feel every curve, every pulse– like Rio was really inside her, dragging against her walls and her clit catching on the ridge when Rio bottomed out. </p><p>“<em> Mierda </em> – you feel that?” her wife growled, but her voice was just as wrecked, her hands bruising. “I can feel your cunt trying to keep inside. You’re dripping, <em> mi vida, </em> making such a mess on my cock.” </p><p>Agatha whined, her eyes rolling as she nodded, unable to speak as the room filled with wet slap of skin on skin. The toy pistoled in and out, the bed beneath them moving, hitting against the wall with every thrust as their moans became a chorus. Her body trembled, sweat dripping down her arm and face, her belly heavy with their son, jostled just enough with each brutal thrust. A warm hand slid under her, fingers finding her clit within seconds, circling it just as she liked– for once not teasingly, just giving what she needed. </p><p>“Come for me, <em> mi amor, </em>” her wife husked, hips never slowing. “Come while I fuck you with my cock.” </p><p>She cried out, almost there, she just needed a little more– the coil was tight in her lower belly– just another nudge to snap the wires. </p><p>Rio moaned low, “If you could see yourself, <em> mi vida. </em>So full of life, so perfect, so beautiful– round with child but begging for more. You want me to fill you, baby? Is that what you need, my good girl?” </p><p>Agatha was gone. The coil exploded through her whole body as her eyes rolled back. A silent scream left her lips. The air left her lungs and she swore she was flying– the toy so deep inside her she could feel it in her throat. Her walls clenched greedily, pulling on it, milking it, trying to hold onto the sensation as she pulsed and squirted around it. Rio held her through it as her body trembled, hands on holding her hips up as she came with her. </p><p>She couldn’t stop coming, her breaths coming out in loud moans, her wife’s name loud into the room as hands guided her. Her wife didn’t pull out, keeping them tethered as they laid on their sides, her wife spooning and holding her closely until Agatha’s body only trembled from the aftershock.  </p><p>“Breathe, my love,” a soft voice murmured against her ear. “That’s it. I have you. You’re safe. You’re mine.” </p><p>She buried her face into the ruined quilt below them, overwhelmed, undone. Sweat drenched her, her breathing hard. Her wife curled closer behind her, soft kisses to her neck, sweet and perfect. They were soft, grounding, easing her down as a hand brushed along her hip and to her belly, rubbing circles on her side.</p><p>Agatha didn’t know how long they laid together, her wife pressing soft kisses to her until they both felt a sharp kick to Rio’s palm. They chuckled, Agatha pressing her hand just beside her wife’s to receive another hard, visible kick.</p><p>“You woke him, my love,” she teased, smiling as she knew Rio was rolling her eyes. “He’s already like you– cranky and fussy when woken up mid-nap.”</p><p>Lips pressed to her cheek, “That’s all you, <em> mi amor. </em> And technically, <em> we </em>woke him up.” </p><p>Agatha laughed, the sound still frayed at the edges making her realize how sore her throat was from moaning, or screaming… whatever. Her head fell back against her wife’s shoulder, their sweat-slicked skin, making them stick together. </p><p>“Well,” she whispered, her hand running over the spot where their son began another tantrum. “He’s got your temper.” </p><p>“He’s kicking like he’s trying to complain to upper management.” </p><p>“He probably is,” she chuckled. “Complaining at how loud I was.” </p><p>Rio lips pressed a smile into her neck, “Or maybe he doesn’t like to share the attention.”</p><p>Agatha turned her face slightly to look at her wife, “Jealous? You’re calling him jealous? Goddess, he really is yours.” </p><p>Another laugh rang in the room, one full of love and tenderness as hands pulled her closer. A hand slipped around her belly, tracing the shape of him– or least his tantrum. They fell into a quiet hum, her wife placing kisses still to the back of her neck, a hand calming the ill-tempered within, and Agatha laid, still full of her wife, deep inside her.</p><p> </p><p>It was only later did Agatha realize the toy slipped out, the quilt kicked to the floor, and her body wiped of their activities. She heard her wife swear somewhere in the room, the lights now turned off before she heard two thumbs of a certain traumatized rabbit. </p><p>“Señor, just go to bed– it’s not even that late,” she heard her wife grumble to the rabbit before footsteps grew closer and the bed shifted. </p><p>Agatha turned, immediately resting half her body on her wife before a pillow was being placed behind her back, adding to her comfort as she breathed in her wife’s raw scent. She nuzzled her face deep into Rio’s neck, letting out a content sigh as lips pressed to her head. </p><p>“Happy birthday, my love,” she whispered, before her eyes became too heavy, and she fell deep into sleep, feeling loved and sated. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wondered if she could kill someone temporarily… like just put them asleep for a moment… minutes… hours ... couple days… weeks maybe– more like seven weeks to be exact. Nicholas was due in seven weeks and a certain someone, if she didn’t calm her fucking tits down, would not be around to meet her son. It was dramatic, totally something over the top that crossed her mind, but nonetheless, it was Agatha Harkness-Vidal totally over being pregnant, especially with an overdoting wife. Don’t get her wrong. She loves the little shit with all of her heart. She didn’t think there was a possibility to love anything else as much as she loves Rio… until they decided to have a kid together, but that’s besides the point. The point was that little shit was driving her up a wall. Call it hormones, call it the lack of sleep she was getting– blame it on Rio’s spawn growing in her belly and never being able to sit still like his </span>
<em>
<span>mami– </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha was at her breaking point. She was ready to throttle Rio, ready throw her out a window, ready to scream, ready to–</span>
</p><p>
<span>Soft lips brushed against her cheek, immediately smoothing the crease between her eyebrows. Her body betrayed her, the tension vaporizing off of her in slowly lulling waves. A hand was on her stomach, comforting the little kicking bunny inside her before cold air was hitting her now bare stomach and those soft lips were now worshipping with warm, tender presses. She heard </span>
<em>
<span>pianissimo</span>
</em>
<span> Spanish whispers, dancing across her skin– lyrical murmurs that eased their son’s squirming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A featherlike kiss pressed into her side before, “</span>
<em>
<span>Tranquilo, conejito. No tortures a tu mamá. Necesita descansar.” </span>
</em>
<span>(Easy, little bunny. Don’t torture your mama. She needs her rest.) </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled slowly, molten fury cooling into thick fog. Her fingers twitched where she rested her head on them, still itching for a dramatic gesture– perhaps just a firm poke to Rio’s forehead, or jab at her sides– nothing life-threatening– but the storm had passed for now. Rio had that effect. Always had and probably always will. It was both comforting and fucking irritating, how quickly she could unravel Agatha’s frustration with the gentlest of touch, with that voice– a lullaby underneath the stars, sweetened with even when laced with worry. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I </span>
<em>
<span>am </span>
</em>
<span>resting,” she muttered, her voice sharp-edged, but dulled like a sword after striking too much. “Or I was trying too until </span>
<em>
<span>someone</span>
</em>
<span> bothered the little gremlin.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife only hummed her laughter, kissing her stomach again before her touch pulled away. She didn’t bother opening up her eyes and for once, she believed her wife got the hint to leave her alone, but not to be too far. To be quiet, but never silent. To stop worrying, but to never stop caring. To stop hovering, but to never stop holding her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t. </span>
</p><p>
<span>(Not that Agatha knew what she wanted in all honesty.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, Agatha listened to small jars being opened with a silent pop before a hand was on her stomach again, fingers tracing the oil in protective, strengthening, and loving runes on her. She could only imagine what their altar looked like, covered in ashes from Rio burning bay leaves, surrounded by offerings, candles burned outside with good intentions for pregnancy. Gods, Rio was so sweet and worried, it was nauseating… but it also worried her. Her wife was so overprotective, so overly doting ever since they went on maternity leave. Well, even before that, she believed it started after her wife’s birthday. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was the night after she made Rio come in her pants (which was a huge boost to her ego and so fucking hot. Sue her. That was her own gift that day) Agatha had woken up with Rio sitting on the bed, pulling out sweets from the </span>
<em>
<span>Two Magpies Bakery</span>
</em>
<span>. (This is in England, not New York… just go with it.) It was their favorite place and somewhere where Agatha had planned to take them before taking Rio to lunch and back to the hotel to get ready for the Broadway play : </span>
<em>
<span>The Outsiders. </span>
</em>
<span>Instead, she looked at the time and saw it was noon. She had an alarm set– something to wake her and her Rio to get ready and go, but instead, Rio went and picked up the food and brought it back to her. When she questioned her wife, her wife just shook her shoulders and handed her two breakfast brioche rolls, fried eggs, and extra crispy bacon before settling on her weird ass choice of mushrooms on toast. They had sex again after, apparently getting fucked into the mattress the night before wasn’t enough so they kicked out the bunny from the bathroom where Rio and her definitely did not save water… and then ruined the mattress more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At the Broadway show, Agatha totally didn’t cry into her wife’s shoulder at Dally’s death and the song “Stay Gold.” But walking down to their seats at the beginning, Rio had a firm arm on her, guiding her carefully down the steps. During intermission, her wife pushed through the crowd for her and when they did reach the bathroom, Rio made them cut the line and distracted a Karen while Agatha went. In truth, if Rio hadn’t had them cut the line, she was sure her son would have publicly embarrassed her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When they were finally home, things escalated. Her wife would appear after her lectures, freezing any approaching student in their tracks, and in real time, Agatha saw them rethink their life decisions at the moment Rio would walk into the classroom, parting the wave of leaving students like Moses did the Red Sea. Her wife would be at her side immediately, never openly touching or revealing her softer side, just a firm gaze that kept students far away from both of them. Rio would always have lunches with her, and would block out that time specifically for her. During faculty meetings, which Agatha was always late to, even before pregnancy, to mess with her wife– well, she came in late and there was always an empty seat available next to her wife that was never open before. Normally, another dean or head of a department would assume the chair as closer to ‘power,’ but then, it was left open for her where lemon tea was ready and her favorite craving beside her folder. And Rio would stand or come over from where she was up by the board, and without breaking her flow of talking, would pull out the seat, take her hand, and help her sit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then came her last day. She received a few gifts, some chocolates, and Eva even gifted her a Shakespeare onesie that said “To Be or Not to Be” which she pretended to be disgusted by and rolled her eyes. Ireland gifted her two bottles of wine, in which later she read “One for Dr. Vidal” and a non-alcoholic sparkling grape juice : “One for Dr. Harkness.” It was cute, sweet even. Her older students made a card for both her and Rio, and even William and Ryan gave their own gifts of sweets. From other professors, their mailboxes were full of cards and chocolates. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Let it be known, Rio went through all the food like a hawk, throwing any out she deemed wrapped weird, she didn’t like the vibe, or if it wasn’t dark chocolate. Agatha hid the Dubai chocolate that the head of the department gave her and gave it to Rio when her wife caught her with three bites left only for the little shit to throw it away claiming it had too much sugar… which it probably did. </span>
</p><p>
<span>For the last few weeks Rio had been home cooking their meals, refusing take-out Thursdays or when Agatha suggested it. Her wife would just ask what was her order and just cook it. Which was fine for Agatha, but it wasn’t the end of the worrying and the doting. When they went into maternity leave and because Agatha wasn’t moving like she did on campus, Rio would trick her into doing daily walks whether it was the backyard, up and down the street, the park, or in town. It was perfect though, Agatha wasn’t complaining at all. She never did if it meant being by her wife’s side. The problem came when Rio wanted to sign her up for prenatal pilates. Agatha was a pilates queen before her own instructor went on maternity leave for a year. And then when Agatha got pregnant, she stopped… but pregnant Agatha, surrounded by other pregnant mothers who would all be bragging about what their husbands did, meanwhile the husband was likely screwing the assistant… well Agatha has said enough. </span>
</p><p>
<span>All it took was one glare and one snide comment for Rio to shut her mouth and continue on another topic like it never happened. A few days later her wife asked her to do prenatal yoga which Agatha only agreed if they did it in their basement together. Well, most of the time those sessions led to sex on the couch down there, and Agatha did plenty of yoga then. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But it grew worse… well, she wasn’t sure what was the word for it. When Agatha would take her naps, Rio would be researching and researching. The one night she caught her wife after Nicholas had kicked her bladder, on her home laptop in the dining room. Three notebooks were spread out, Rio’s coloured pens were lined in front of her as she kept alternating, and don’t get Agatha started on the sticky tabs Rio used for labelling. Agatha didn’t bother to look, just closed her wife’s lap top, grabbed her hand, and dragged her to bed. Then were the apps– </span>
<em>
<span>plural</span>
</em>
<span>– Agatha found on Rio’s phone. She wasn’t snooping. Her wife asked her to check to go in her emails when Agatha saw the three pregnancy tracking apps. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then came their go-bag. Rio packed </span>
<em>
<span>four</span>
</em>
<span>. two for the baby, and two for them. Agatha had caught her reorganizing them about five times now. But that was only when she was awake, she wasn’t sure what her wife was up to after she was asleep. But the final straw came early that morning when Rio was </span>
<em>
<span>nesting</span>
</em>
<span>. Not Agatha, her non-pregnant wife. </span>
<em>
<span>She </span>
</em>
<span>should be the one nesting, but it was Rio. Rio was reorganizing the nursery, refolding onesies onto a different shelf, and organized the sock drawer. Her wife rebuilt the changing table, adjusted the diapers before settling the books by height and colour in the bookshelf… Agatha would have to change it back. What kind of monster organized books like that? It was by genre first, and then by the author’s last name. And she would have to refold the onesies and other clothes… okay, maybe she was starting to nest. She was already thinking about changing the decorative pillows on the couch, changing the pictures in the hallway, and getting new paintings… she was definitely nesting, but </span>
<em>
<span>why was Rio? </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha kept her eyes closed, ignoring the lotion now being placed on her stomach as she realized she couldn’t remember the last time her wife went to the greenhouse to garden other than watering the plants. Rio’s new gloves that Agatha bought for her birthday were still sitting on the kitchen counter unused. She couldn’t remember the last time Rio sketched, played her drums, or found some project to keep her busy where she would disappear for hours. The playstation was starting to collect dust and Rio had also stopped working out as much, because her wife was always at least in a ten foot radius. Fuck, she wasn’t even sure if her wife had texted Alice or Hela.</span>
</p><p>
<span>No, Agatha had no problem with the doting, with Rio always ready to hold her when she was unsteady, to make her craving food, to hold her in the bathtub, rub her swallow ankles, talk to </span>
<em>
<span>conejito,</span>
</em>
<span> or to fuck Agatha through the mattress until she was sated. No, the problem was that Rio hadn’t done anything lately to make herself happy, to relax her own nerves… and this was stemming from an unforeseen weight… something so much deeper than what the surface showed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And the first step she needed her wife to do was to get the fuck out of the house and be away from her for at least half a day. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She needed her wife to be herself. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The plan was easy to enact. All she had to do was text Hela and Alice. They didn’t ask questions, didn’t prod at why Agatha needed Rio to get out– they knew. Agatha told them to create a separate group chat without her and Rio and to plan whatever– bowling, a bar night, karaoke night, axe throwing, one of those rage rooms– something to get Rio back to being Rio. Sure, Rio was still her, still loving and sweet like she has always been– but Agatha couldn’t go an hour without Rio worrying about something with their son instead of enjoying the leave before they were sleep deprived, covered in spit up, and running solely on a baby induced fever. Her wife was running herself into the ground. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was four am the night before when Agatha had woken up to an empty bed. She had looked towards the master bathroom, not finding a low glow and immediately stood. The hallway was dark, nothing moved, just sitting in an eerie silence. Towards the floor, a white light illuminated by the doorway to the nursery where Agatha spotted the door open. Stepping inside, the door creaked low as a chill wrapped around her. She hugged her arms to herself, missing the warmth of the bed while her wife’s cool body held her; instead she was up, staring at the open window of their nursery. Moon light draped in, shining directly on the crib. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>We need new blinds and maybe to angle the crib a different way, </span>
</em>
<span>her nesting mind stored the information away for later. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes had narrowed back to the crib, finding her wife standing over in just her oversized Stevie Nicks shirt. Black boxers hugged her hips, but Agatha couldn’t even admire her wife. Her back was stiff, drawn tight and rigid. In her arms was the security blanket with a rabbit head, ears, arms, and a patch in the side where Agatha removed the tail and stitched the hole back up in case their little one decided to explore the world with his mouth. She nuzzled the thing under her chin, her head tilted back, as she stared up into the ceiling. Rio was terrified, terrified of messing up, of not being enough, and most of all, she knew her wife was horrified if she couldn’t protect either of them. Rio was always a protector, a caring, slightly possessive, protector, but Rio was </span>
<em>
<span>hers.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“My love,” she had whispered softly, causing her wife to whip around with the rabbit clutched tightly to her chest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes had gone comically wide, like a child being caught doing something they were explicitly told not too. Then, Rio was lying the security blanket back into the crib, approaching her quickly. Hands were on her stomach, lips pressed just beside her lips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Mi amor, </span>
</em>
<span>what are you doing awake?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned into her wife, nuzzling into Rio’s neck, “The bed was empty and I went searching for you. What are you doing in here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span> Rio ignored her question, pulling back to take her hand. She followed her wife into the bedroom, curling up on her chest as lips peppered touches to her head. Her wife didn’t answer her question, but </span>
<em>
<span>she did</span>
</em>
<span>– in her silence she did. It was how she held Agatha a little tighter, a hand resting on her stomach protectively, pressing the tiniest bit firmer. It was in the way she seemed to hold her breath, and her heart beating a little faster underneath her ear. She lifted her head off Rio’s chest, turning to find her wife watching her. She met her lips softly, trying to ease the tension she carried. Rio held her a little tighter, keeping her as close as possible and Agatha let her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And before Agatha had drifted off, she placed another kiss at the corner of Rio’s mouth, “I love you, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was going to kill someone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her sights were set on Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was going to be the first person in her line of sight anyway.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Pourquoi pas ? </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was the end of March and whatever the fucking humans did to the planet was about to set Agatha off on anyone who didn’t believe there was something wrong with our planet. It was eighty degrees fahrenheit or twenty-seven celsius… in the Northeast of the fucking United States of America. </span>
<b>
<em>Fuck this place</em>
</b>
<span>. Fuck the sun. Fuck fate for deciding their airconditioning wasn’t working. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And worse, Agatha couldn’t stand the feeling of her own skin against her, especially after her shower. So, she found Rio’s green flowy Boho pants, thanking the gods that the elastics weren’t tight against her skin as they hung low on her hips and under her belly. Okay, maybe she needed that sweet pine scent of her wife. She grabbed Rio’s sleep shirt off the bed and put it on, tying the shirt up over her belly with a hair tie in the back. Her belly could breath, and her skin wasn’t touching that much and she could still be cool. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She grumbled as she made her way down the hall, figuring Rio would be in the basement fixing the damn thing, but froze when she saw their coven sitting on their back porch– Lilia, Hela, Alice, and Jen– all laughing together as Rio passed out water. At least the stupid utility belt was hanging around her hips. Agatha licked her lips, starting at the way it pulled at Rio basketball shorts, revealing the lace– </span>
<em>
<span>fuck she is wearing a thong– </span>
</em>
<span>of her underwear and revealing Agatha’s favorite V-line. She tore her eyes away, looking for Señor Scratchy, hoping the bunny was alright. She looked in his pen, finding it empty before checking the kitchen, wondering if he climbed on to lay on the cool counters. Don’t ask Agatha how he managed to do that. Rio and her were still trying to figure it out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The sound of a low whistle made her whip around to her wife coming back into the house. Her lips were formed into that irritating smirk as her eyes shamelessly wandered Agatha’s body. They travelled the length of her before resting on her bare stomach. Her tongue pushed against her cheek as she pulled the belt from her hips, sitting it on the counter before hands were on her hips pulling Agatha against her wife. Her arms wrapped around broad shoulders, fingers already playing with the sweaty hairs there. Lips kissed hers softly before hands were on her stomach, the little rabbit kicking at Rio’s hands. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned into her wife, completely forgetting about killing her as she breathed in her wife’s scent. Pine, juniper, and something distinctly her wife– something strongly her wife. Rio technically stinked, but Agatha never cared. She was used to it from their college days with Rio coming back from the gym, soaked in sweat, wrapping her arms around Agatha, and covering her too. Most of the time, if Rio wasn’t elbowed or hit, Rio would be getting her post workout in the shower with her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha might have grown to like it– sue her. Rio was her wife, the father-mother of their son– the love of her life. If she did… per se, didn’t mind the scent of her wife’s sweat, that was no one’s business but hers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her nose brushed along her wife’s neck, taking another quick breath in– a chuckle rang out into the room, tolling that she had been caught. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you smelling me, you perv?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled away abruptly, “No, you just stink–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio only hummed, chuckling darkly–</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whatever </span>
<em>
<span>you </span>
</em>
<span>are about to do– need I remind you that I have been </span>
<em>
<span>graciously</span>
</em>
<span> carrying and growing your son.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife pulled away, opening her arms up in mock surrender before taking a towel and wiping her face, “I ended up calling someone. She’s on her way to fix the AC for us, but why is the coven here? They just said you were expecting them– Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had stopped listening. There was a tightening feeling in her lower stomach, something that was very much like cramps. Her wife was quick, a cold hand to her naval before another caressed her cheek, her eyes wide with worry. But she didn’t say anything, just held her close until the tightening stopped. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha breathed in sharply before releasing the long breath as Rio kissed the side of her head, “It’s alright, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor. </span>
</em>
<span>It’s just a Braxton Hick. Your body is practicing for when he comes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hands were now in hers, guiding her to the back porch where the coven was arguing, “I have the sprinkler on outside with them. Stay with them and I’ll get a shower and be right out, </span>
<em>
<span>mi amor.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She nodded as the door slid open and immediately all of their eyes were on her stomach. Alice looked like she was ready to launch out of her seat at her, Lilia held a hand to her chest as Jen swirled her margarita in hand. Hela was the only one who stood to cautiously approach her, handing her a cold bottle of water.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Congratulations, Mama Harkness. It’s been a while.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She scowled at her, making the others laugh as Rio guided her to sit down before Rio was behind her, fingers in her wet hair. She closed her eyes, breathing in as her wife started a French braid on the top of her head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So how’s the little one?” Lilia sat up, her voice soft, not insisting. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was careful, giving her enough room where she could, if she wanted, not answer. This was why Lilia was her best friend. She knew when to be soft with her and when she could absolutely annoy the shit out of Agatha. If it weren’t for Lilia… and Alice, her and Rio might have never been together . </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He kicks me a lot,” she replied, holding back a moan as her wife’s fingers ran through her hair before continuing the braid.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wife laughed behind her, “</span>
<em>
<span>El conejito </span>
</em>
<span>never sits still. When Agatha is asleep, he kicks me at night through her stomach.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hela tilted her head, “</span>
<em>
<span>Conjito– </span>
</em>
<span>what is that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Little rabbit,” Alice answered, her eyes still not leaving the baby bump. “Can we feel? Goddess, I can’t believe how real this is– you really are growing a baby.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha went to open her mouth, figuring it couldn’t hurt. As long as strangers didn’t ask, Agatha didn’t mind if it was their friends. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But before she could, her wife was tying off the braid and a hand was on her stomach, “Maybe later Alice, when she cools down. Hela, if the handywoman comes, can you show her the AC unit. I’m gonna hop in the shower.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She held back the roll of her eyes as her wife kissed her cheek before heading into the house. All eyes were on her, but her wife either didn’t notice or didn’t care. The moment Rio was out of ear shot, Agatha sat up, her hand on her belly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please tell me you have a plan to get her out of the house.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They all stared at her sympathetically, Hela and Alice even more so, and Agatha’s fingers twitched. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hela sat up, “Agatha, she doesn’t seem off. She’s her same overprotective self. I would have killed to have someone like Rio during my pregnancy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze at that, swallowing hard as she remembered Rio leaving on random days to help Hela emotionally during her pregnancy. Alice would be there too and well… Agatha’s emotional range, unless it was Rio but even then it wasn’t great, was the size of a tea spoon. She blinked for a moment, her mouth opening awkwardly as both hands were now cradling her stomach. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please, don’t take me as complaining,” she started quietly. “I know how lucky I am to have Rio, but I am just… concerned. Rio is worrying herself to death.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The coven all grumbled, Jen swallowing the last of her margarita in one gulp while Lilia sat back and groaned with her pointer finger and thumb pinching her eyebrows. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice sat up, “Agatha, respectfully, you realized who you married, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She shook her head, “No, this is different. Rio, when she’s stressed, she plays video games, finds random projects to do, works out, and we all know the greenhouse is her safe space. She hasn’t been in that green house unless she is watering them, and even then, she doesn’t take her time– those plants are her babies” Agatha gestured around them to the evergreen growing on the porch. “It’s not like her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They all stared at Agatha like she was stupid. Lilia and Jen looked away while Alice and Hela shared a look. Hela was the one to sit up, frowning slightly at her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, can I just remind you </span>
<em>
<span>who</span>
</em>
<span> you are growing right in here?” she said softly, a hand on the curve. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She watched as the stoic woman actually cracked a smile when </span>
<em>
<span>conjito </span>
</em>
<span>kicked at her. She pulled back, all of them staring at her .</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hela chuckled, “You are carrying her </span>
<em>
<span>real</span>
</em>
<span> baby. Of course, he </span>
<em>
<span>and you </span>
</em>
<span>are going to be her entire focus.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhaled slowly, the weight of their gazes pressing than her belly for a moment. Her spine pressed into the cushion behind her, hand still resting instinctively over the firm swell between her palms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” she whispered, barely louder than the small breeze that graced them. “I know. But, she’s unravelling and stitching herself back together a hundred times a day. So when will the threads fray? I need her to go out and be herself.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice leaned forward then, elbows on her knees, gaze fierce, “You think she’s falling apart, but from where we are sitting, she’s stronger than ever. She’s holding up the world and sure, she’s quieter, maybe not obsessing over her plant babies or gaming– she is transforming to be your son’s other mother. You know, the one who isn’t breastfeeding him– or rather the one who he didn’t come out of– OW!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen pulled her hand back from slapping Alice on the arm.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia sighed, blowing a stray curl from her face, “What she means to say is that Rio is preparing– nesting in her own way.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips parted to cut in, but nothing came. The wind shifted– another needed breeze blowing on them. She looked down to their son kicking again, a visible distortion in her otherwise smooth curve.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio’s never half-assed her way through anything. She’s not gonna start now, especially not with your son.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And,” Jen added with a lazy wave of her glass, “she’s not used to being afraid. Not like this. It’s different when love has a heartbeat, you know?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart twinged at that. Not because it was new– but because it was right. Rio, fearless and kinetic, had never flinched in the face of any chaos. But this… this was a different kind of unknown. A future with tiny hands and cries in the night and lullabies in a language neither of them had grown up with. And Rio, for all her fire, was terrified. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Still,” Agatha’s voice stayed soft, “I just want her to breathe. Really breathe. Not for me, not even for him– but for herself. So please, tell me you guys have a plan.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hela smirked this time, sitting up, “Oh, we do. She is not going to like it by the way. Don’t let her sweet talk her way out of this, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice nodded, “We are going in the center city to see the new Jurassic movie and then taking her shopping.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And not baby clothes,” Jen tilted her head. “I can imagine you two have enough.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And I am staying here with you,” Lilia smiled, placing a hand on her stomach to feel him kick. “That way, your wife isn’t freaking out about you being by yourself and we can catch up if you would like. The girls and I figured we can cook dinner and when they come back, depending on how you’re feeling, we can take the to-go containers or all eat here.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled softly, “That sounds perfect.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The screen door shut, causing them to turn to find Rio in black shorts and a tank with her hair a wet mop on her head, “What sounds perfect?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>

</p><p> </p><p>
<b>The Coven</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice stared wide-eyed as she watched her best friend hastily whispering to her wife in the corner of the house as the handywoman that came over finally fixed their AC. It was rapid Spanish– none of them able to keep up as Agatha scowled at Rio, her eyebrow raised, her hands cradling underneath her stomach. It was a strange sight– maybe strange wasn’t the word, incredible maybe. From what Lilia had told her and from what she knew of the brunette, if anyone told Agatha that she would be married and now pregnant, she would have laughed in your face and possibly spit in it. Yet, it was the same for her best friend. Rio had never looked long term… that was until Agatha. They all knew how possessive and Rio was over her wife now, but this was different. Rio was more than protective of her pregnant wife– in fact ever since the incident with Evanora, she hadn’t seen the worry lines leave Rio’s face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her best friend raised her voice higher, the Spanish fluid and quick to the point where her wife even looked lost for a moment before cupping Rio’s cheeks to calm her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a heavy sigh before Agatha continued in English, “My love, it is like six hours away from me–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you starting with Braxton Hicks–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And they’re </span>
<em>
<span>just </span>
</em>
<span>Braxton Hicks contractions. We have seven more weeks, my love. He isn’t coming anytime now. Go have fun. Drink for me– eat sushi for me. And when you come home, Lilia and I will have dinner ready.”</span>
</p><p><span>The stressed wife shook her head, her hands on her wife’s stomach, “</span><em><span>Pero ¿y si–</span></em><span>”</span><span><br/></span> <span>“Rio.”</span></p><p>
<span>Alice walked away, standing next to Hela as she nodded the handywoman out of the house. She didn’t mean to eavesdrop– well, she kind of did– but the weight of the moment between Agatha and Rio was too sacred to interrupt. Not that she could’ve if she tried. When Rio was locked in like that, love curling around her like a hurricane refusing to let go, only Agatha could untangle her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> gone,” Hela murmured beside her, her lips quirking in a knowing smile. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice didn’t respond, only crossed her arms and watched. Rio was brushing her thumbs along Agatha’s sides now, nose tucked close, breathing like she was trying to memorize her. Maybe she was. Alice had known Rio as long as any one else, for the matter, maybe a couple months longer as they met the summer Rio had moved from Puerto Rico. She was independent, strongwilled, laughed with reckless joy on rooftops, and walked away from people who tried too hard to hold her. But Agatha was the only one who’d held her without chains. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine,” Rio finally exhaled, forehead pressed against Agatha’s. “Okay, but you text me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Every hour on the hour,” her wife promised. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No sarcasm or jokes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“One joke.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffed, rolling her eyes before their lips sealed in a brief kiss that made Alice turn around like it burned. Beside her, Hela made a gagging noise as Jen visibly shivered, coming beside her. Alice wrapped her arm around her waist, all of them ignoring the couple in the corner as Lilia approached them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You realize you’re basically kidnapping Rio, right?”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>The group nodded, a chorus of “yep”s echoing around them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia cocked her head, “And you realize you are not keeping her still for the movie?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They shared looks with each other as the kooky woman smirked, “Agatha and I already talked. Just keep her busy for at least four hours. Shop, book stores, craft stores, plants stores or whatever. Just keep her away from baby stuff. Agatha says their nursery is overrun.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lilia,” Rio’s voice sounded behind them, making them all jump.</span>
</p><p>
<span>All eyes narrowed to the mother-to-be as the pregnant wife sat down on the couch, rearranging the pillows around her like a poised queen. Alice startled, hearing a light patter coming from the hallway until a caramel spotted bunny emerged, hopping towards the couch and jumping straight in Agatha’s lap. He curled up against her stomach, bunny eyes closing, nose twitching, and fucking purring. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A stern voice brought Alice back to her best friend listing off things for her wife, “ –she needs her vitamins with food, not on an empty stomach, or she’ll get queasy. And don’t let her convince you she’s not tired. If she starts blinking too slow, </span>
<em>
<span>that’s it.</span>
</em>
<span> Nap time.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice glanced at her girlfriend, who mouthed ‘</span>
<em>
<span>blinking too slow</span>
</em>
<span>?’ before stifling a laugh. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And if she says she doesn’t want to eat even though she is fidgeting” Rio continued, hands on her hips now like a general issuing wartime orders, “she’s lying. If anything she wants the lavender bread or strawberries with salt. Now the AC works, keep it cold. She likes being cold– have the blankets and my hoodies ready. But she only likes the purple blanket that we keep in our bedroom and…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen leaned against her, kissing her cheek, “Please tell me you won’t be this overbearing if we ever have a kid in the future. It’s like watching the overprotective scared first-time dad in a 90s sitcom.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She is a first-time dad,” Alice muttered back. “If that dad knew how to kill a polar bear with just her bare hands.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>At that, Lilia straightened, her tone gentle but commanding, “Rio, I will treat your wife like she is British Royalty. She will rest, we will read together, or put on </span>
<em>
<span>Friends</span>
</em>
<span>. Now go. Before they drag you out by your hair.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked between them all, eyes narrowed, clearly calculating whether or not she could </span>
<em>
<span>really </span>
</em>
<span>trust her coven with the most precious thing in her life. Then her gaze landed on her wife– legs curled, bunny honking softly, and a knowing smile blooming like a fresh tulip on her lips. Her eyes were closed, already dozing off even with the coven present. Alice jumped when Rio brushed by her, cupping her wife’s cheek before helping her lay down. They all groaned again as they kissed before Rio muttered something in Spanish, but Alice had enough. Jen and her shared a look before they both grabbed her, pulling her out the door before she could find another excuse. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>They piled in Hela’s truck, old rock songs already blasting from the speakers and windows down, hitting them in the face with summer air instead of spring. They were all screaming and singing, carrying on like a bunch of college students that just finished finals, officially out for the summer. Jen was in the front, leaning back, her arms through the moon roof as her and Hela carried on in the front. Alice was with them, singing her heart out when she turned to Rio– who was staring out the truck window in her own world. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hela met her eyes in the mirror, both of them staring at Rio who remained oblivious. In her hand, her phone was clutched tightly, almost enough to break the screen. Her leg was bouncing as she played with the ends of her hair, a true tale of nervousness. Rio was always the life of the party, always the one to go too far with her wife tugging her back at the end of the leash– and yet, Rio didn’t even seem to care that Hela turned on </span>
<em>
<span>Bombay Sapphires </span>
</em>
<span>by Stevie Nicks, one of her favorite songs. She didn’t even tap her fingers to the beat nor did her mouth move with the lyrics. They tried </span>
<em>
<span>Sleep Token </span>
</em>
<span>next and still got nothing. They even tried </span>
<em>
<span>Until I Found You, </span>
</em>
<span>the song Agatha and Rio danced to on their wedding night. Brown eyes narrowed, but still Rio remained unusually quiet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen, despite being new, recognized Rio was not herself. She glanced back at her girlfriend, wondering if Alice had an idea, but she looked just as lost. So perhaps Hela talking of her daughter would relax Rio’s nerves. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hela, so how is Lilith doing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t take her eyes off the road, but warmth cracked through her cold exterior as a single hand drifted to her empty belly, “Oh she’s wonderful. It was hard leaving her today– she’s in that stage where she only wants me. My partner has her today, so please wish them luck. I’m surprised they haven’t texted me yet.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen smiled, her heart warming hearing the woman beside had a support system, “Aw, how did you and your partner meet?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I was in my third trimester actually. They were super sweet– we met at a coffee shop– I just wanted a cinnamon roll and I don’t know. Kori and I just started talking and then next thing I knew, they came to the hospital after I had Lilith with flowers and a sushi boat. Gods, Rio, you need to get Agatha a sushi boat after she has your son.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They all watched as Rio’s head snapped off the window, peering at Hela with unwavering attention. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s head tilted as she shifted in her seat, “A sushi boat?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Hela nodded, “Yeah, it’s free for first time mothers and they deliver right to the hospital too. I’ll give you the name of the place.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed thickly for a moment, her eyes darting right out the window before speaking hesitantly, “How… how was it? Like with everything?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She raised an eyebrow, as the hand on her stomach rubbed softly. For a moment, Hela was transported back to when she first had Lilith. She was so pumped full of drugs and that epidural did fucking wonders. Her eyes drifted off, still focused on the road, but elsewhere as Lilith– the small baby was placed on her chest, her cries already softening, as impossibly small fingers clung to her.</span>
</p><p><span>“It was everything, Rio,” her voice was uncharacteristically soft, a tone perhaps she only used on Lilith or her partner. “They pumped me up full of drugs though, I barely felt a thing. Agatha will be fine. Your son will be here in no time.” </span><span><br/></span> <span>Rio nodded, her gaze going back to the window but it ricocheted back, “Okay, but what if– well they said that Nicholas is on the bigger side– what if–”</span><span><br/></span> <span>The coven froze, tuning out the rambling overprotective wife. Each of their eyes widened, realizing that the mother-to-be slipped up, releasing the name of her unborn son in her rambling. Hela’s foot eased off the gas, Jen lifted off her sunglasses, turning around, her mouth parted open, and Alice twisted in her seat, her whole body turning towards Rio in pure wonder. No one spoke for a moment, except for Rio who continued to ramble on and on about wayward possibilities. </span></p><p>
<span>“Nicholas?” Hela finally said, her voice lilting at the edges like she didn’t want to spook a wild animal. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked owlishly, stunned like she hadn’t realized she had said anything at all. Her lips parted and then closed, repeating like a stupefied fish. Alice took Rio’s hand aiming for the contact to jolt Rio out of it. It worked. The hand was ripped away like it was burned as Rio sat up too fast, the seat belt pinning her back in her seat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Gods, Agatha is going to </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> kill me this time,” she spoke to herself before covering her face with her hands. “</span>
<em>
<span>Mierda!”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span> The group laughed softly as Jen turned to her, “You guys picked a name?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s voice was fragile, “Yeah, on my birthday in a botanical garden. I was talking about hemerocallis, also called ‘Fire Chief Nicolas.’ He kicks every time we say the name.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Brown eyes stared up at the sky through the moon roof, watching the clouds pass by quickly as Hela pulled off the interstate to the mall. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He feels real now, huh?” Hela said gently. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t answer, her gaze now on the huge building of the mall. Oh, she was going to kill them. She liked shopping when it was for her wife or for </span>
<em>
<span>conejito. </span>
</em>
<span>She hated shopping for herself, not as much as Agatha, but still enough. This was going to be torture. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>

</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice was secretly fuming, not even the gentle circles on her back from her girlfriend’s fingers could soothe her. They were sitting and eating a small lunch, drinking– well Hela and Rio weren’t drinking. At least Hela had an excuse. She was still breastfeeding Lilith and she was driving. Rio wasn’t drinking and she didn’t have an excuse, just eating a few fries here and there, while staring at her phone. They knew Agatha should have texted by now but she hadn’t. They didn’t know why, and in fact it was strange to them. She would never break a promise to Rio and starting now– when she was close to giving birth to their son– well, Rio was about to snap the fucking table. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was Hela who received the call from Lilia. She set her tea down, quickly pressing the green button before putting her on speaker. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lilia?” Hela asked, concern leaking from her voice as Rio lunged across the table, taking her phone. </span>
</p><p><span>“What’s wrong? Is she okay? Is it our son? Did she–”</span><span><br/></span> <span>Lilia cut her off softly, “Rio, dear, she is fine. I was calling to let you know that she is asleep so you can quit worrying. I figured I would call Hela so you didn’t blow up when my name flashed across the screen.” </span></p><p><span>Rio remained unimpressed, “Are the pillows there to support her back and belly? She needs good rest now that he stopped kicking her. He was kicking her all night.” </span><span><br/></span> <span>Lilia hummed, still whispering into the phone, “Yes, and Scratchy is at her feet too. I think the baby kicked him when he was against her stomach. I see why you too call the baby a little rabbit.” </span></p><p>
<span>Small smiles all formed on their faces, Hela’s eyes light while Jen leaned against her girlfriend, staring at Rio. And in the moment, it really struck Jen for some reason. Dean Vidal  was really going to be a mom. It wasn’t just rumors, or conversations– neither passing glances or Alice telling her about what Rio was up to. This was </span>
<em>
<span>real</span>
</em>
<span>. She always thought Rio was cold-hearted, uncaring, and detached. She was scary in her own right, but as she got to know Rio over these months, through Alice and working with Rio more, she saw the closely guarded warmth, only kept for those who truly deserved it. Staring at Rio now, Jen already saw a mother before her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As the conversation between Lilia and Rio continued, Jen leaned over to Alice, “She’s gonna be one helluva mother.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her girlfriend smirked, leaning into her shoulder, “Good luck to any kid that bullies their son.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>They laughed, Jen kissing her cheek softly, “Who do you think is going to be scarier? Agatha or Rio?”</span>
</p><p><span>Alice scoffed, “Definitely, Agatha. She’ll tear into the school board or some shit if anyone lays a hand on her baby. Rio is probably going to teach him how to fight.”</span><span><br/></span> <span>“Oh, this kid is going to be a mini her, isn’t he?”</span></p><p>
<span>“Gods help us all if he is like Agatha.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p align="center">

</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Hela made a mistake. A deadly mistake.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d thought they’d chosen wisely by avoiding the mall. After all, within minutes, she, Alice, and Jen had been wrestling Rio away from anything baby-related– body-slamming her out of </span>
<em>
<span>Build-A-Bear</span>
</em>
<span>, dragging her by the arms from </span>
<em>
<span>Babies "R" Us</span>
</em>
<span>, even yanking her back from some random boutique none of them remembered seeing before. Hela had pulled Rio by her hair out of a bookstore, sending toddlers into tears as baby books clattered to the floor. Rio had shrieked at her, but Hela hadn’t cared. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then came the final straw. A full-grown adult– a Dean of a goddamn university– had bolted for a store called</span>
<em>
<span> The Precious Garden</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>All three of them had tackled her, grumbling as they decided, </span>
<em>
<span>Fine</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
<em>
<span>The theater.</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe sitting the Green Witch in a dark room with her favorite silly dead overgrown lizards would finally calm her down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It did not. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Not even close. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The movie had started and Jen and Alice were curled up in a love seat, leaving Hela and Rio in stiff, single seats. Hela kicked up the footrest, tossing buttery popcorn into her mouth as the </span>
<em>
<span>Jurassic Park </span>
</em>
<span>theme roared through the speakers. Rio loved these movies. Or she should have. Instead, the woman was vibrating with restless energy, her dark eyes fixed on Hela’s purse– where they’d stashed Rio’s phone, rerouting Lilia’s messages to Hela’s own. Rio’s jaw twitched, fingers drumming against the armrest, the other hand rubbing her chin– a nervous habit she’d picked up from her wife. Hela exhaled as a dinosaur’s roar shook the theater, the screen flashing red with a kill. She didn’t care. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her focus was on one thing : praying to every god she knew, </span>
<em>
<span>Just let us survive this movie. Let us hit the five hour mark. That’s all. Five hours without Rio losing her damn mind</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She glanced sideways– </span>
</p><p>
<span>The seat was empty. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Popcorn littered the floor. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hela’s blood turned to fire. She shot up, footrest still raised, hands gripping the seat like she could crush it. Alice noticed first, sitting upright. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, come on–” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was gone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ignoring the angry shushes from the audience, all three of them bolted for the exit.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>Rio</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled the breath she hadn’t realized she’d been hoarding, lungs burning as fatigue rolled through her in tremors. Her body pulsed with the raw sting of effort– sweat sliding down her temples, her pulse thudding like drums of war beneath her skin. She glanced down at herself, catching the sharp scent of her own exertion, and grimaced. She soaked her shirt again, sweat dripping down her back, covering her in stink. Despite it being late, the sun starting to set, it felt worse than a Puerto Rico July. Maybe she was exaggerating or maybe she was growing used to the moody weather of the Northeast. Maybe it was because she had been skipping her main gym workout. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She hadn’t worked out in weeks, not really. Unless you counted carrying every heavy thing in the house– moving the crib for her wife, building the new book shelf because of course they didn’t have enough bookshelves, and building a toy chest made from mahogany wood while her wife sat with her in the garage. It was better than building in the green house, but it still led her to be running up and down the steps for her and her wife– fetching water, wool for her wife to crochet or knit or whatever, books, her phone– all because she wanted to sit with Rio even if they didn’t speak… Rio’s heart leapt at that. But it wasn’t like she was totally inactive. She strolled with her very pregnant wife on walks in the park or in their yard and coaxed her hips open in yoga poses and breathing exercises– and, oh, yes, if you counted sex. Rio definitely did. She deserved a goddamn medal just for lifting Agatha off the floor and carrying her all the way to their bedroom without trembling.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>The theater her friends kidnapped sat across from the mall, a sea of asphalt between the two buildings. And the store? It was all the way on the opposite end of the mall. But Rio’s mission was crystal clear, heart hammering with urgency as she was pretty sure she knocked a kid over. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh well.</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>Not her kid. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The store was closing in ten minutes, but Rio only needed two– three tops. She’d seen it earlier, </span>
<em>
<span>the </span>
</em>
<span>onesie. Spotted it before her utterly clueless coven had yanked her away, ignoring her protests saying it was just one thing. Which it was and she hadn’t forgotten. If anyone told Rio in the past that something could pull her away from watching her favorite franchise, she would have laughed until she threw up. But here she was, movie forgotten, ignoring the ache in her knee, and blowing right past the protest of the store employee letting her know when the store was closing. Nothing was going to stop her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She made a beeline for the far wall, where rows upon rows of tiny newborn onesies hung and begged her to pull out the shiny new black credit card. Pastels and florals, soft colours and softer fabrics all staring down at her, begging to be the one that holds her newborn, but Rio’s eyes locked onto one in particular. It was white with caramel coloured spots, delicate to the touch and so familiar. She lifted it as if it were made of glass instead of wool and cotton, brushing the sleeves between her fingers. She found the little legs sleeves were wrapped on the bottom, little built in socks with soles of patched pink paw prints. Her breath caught as across the belly was a soft patch of wool, giving way to white and caramel fabric. Her hands moved before her brain could catch up, lifting the tiny hood, and there they were– two wool bunny ears, the tips dipped in caramel. The sight hit her with a strange glowing force, pounding into her heart and twisted it where her face was hurting with how strong her smile was. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Next thing she knew, she was stepping out of the store where Hela, Alice, and Jen were waiting, rolling their eyes at the bag in her hand before turning on their heels back to the truck. Rio followed, humming </span>
<em>
<span>The Ballad of the Witches’ Road </span>
</em>
<span>under her breath as she practically skipped back to the parking lot. </span>
</p><p>
<span>On the ride home, she made them promise not to say anything to her wife. It was surprise, one where the moment her front door opened, she bolted to their room, tucking the onesie into a go-bag before coming back out to the living room, finding her wife exactly where she left her : asleep on the couch, cradling her belly as her heavy breathing filled the room. Rio didn’t hesitate. She moved with practiced ease, sitting beside her wife, and guiding her wife’s head into her lap. Agatha moved in her sleep, a sleepy smile ghosting her lips as she nuzzled into Rio’s thigh before falling deeper into another realm, dreaming of what was to come. </span>

</p><p> </p><p>
<b>Rio </b>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio breathed hard through her nose, flaring it as her lip curled. The black steering wheel in her hands was close to cracking as her grip tightened. Her jaw was clenched, her tongue playing with her cheek as she stared at the road in front of her. For a moment, it felt as if she was on auto-pilot, her body knowing when to stop, when to turn as her mind was elsewhere. Her wife was fearless, insane, and fucking stubborn. She was thirty-eight weeks pregnant– round, completely full, and radiating life as if she was a descendent of Gaia herself. Once a week, they went to their appointments, this time with a new OBGYN as their previous one was also on maternity leave. As far as Rio hoped, they had two more : one next week and the one in two weeks in which their son would be gracing them with his presence. Agatha was close. Rio had read all the symptoms : </p><ul>
<li>Nesting like crazy </li>
<ul>
<li>Agatha ordered new throw pillows for both the upstairs living room and for the basement, bought them a new bed set up where the sheets were just a lighter shade of purple, and the comforter was just a darker shade of green. Rio lost count at how many times her wife refolded the clothes– the baby’s and theirs, how many times Rio moved the crib for her, and not to mention that Rio could no longer find anything in the kitchen anymore despite being the only one who cooked in their house.</li>
</ul>
<li>Lower back pain</li>
<ul>
<li>Agatha’s back was killing her, and no matter what Rio did– back rubs, creams, yoga stretches, and baths– nothing seemed to comfort her wife. </li>
</ul>
<li>Braxton Hicks Contractions</li>
<ul>
<li>They scared the shit out of Rio. She never knew what to do when her wife froze mid-sentenced or when they were laying together, Agatha would press closer into her, seeking comfort. In truth, Rio didn’t know what comfort she could provide for her wife. All she knew was that when the contractions did start, she was expecting for her wife to claw at her. </li>
</ul>
<li>The baby dropped </li>
<ul>
<li>Agatha was carrying low now and from what Rio read, their son’s head was in her pelvis. </li>
</ul>
</ul><p>Now, it was just a waiting game and the new doctor had said that she was on tract– nothing was out of place and their baby boy was strong, healthy– heart was powerful and lungs in perfect condition. From what the technician could tell was that Nicholas already had a full head of hair, which had Rio hopeful that he would have her wife’s thick locks. </p><p>Rio wasn’t mad about any of this though. In fact, she would call herself relaxed now, knowing that her and her wife were about to have a healthy baby boy. Agatha was almost in the thirty ninth week stage, meaning they were in full term if she were to go into labor then, for now, she was in early term, and Rio was perfectly relaxed… <em> was. </em> She was more than happy to stay home with her wife for the last few weeks, instead of going everywhere. Ever since the coven dragged her out of the house that day, her wife was dragging her too– dinner dates, lunches with the coven, symphonies that her wife wanted to see, and she even convinced Rio to see the new ‘live action’ <em> How to Train Your Dragon </em> that Rio <em> did </em> want to see. It was fun and it did relax her, but now that her wife was two weeks away from Nicholas, she was only <em> slightly </em> fidgety. </p><p>Yesterday evening, Rio was on the couch with her wife curled up in her arms, her belly completely on top of hers, and her wife’s face buried in her neck. She was asleep already, <em> conejito </em> finally sitting still enough for her to slip off. <em> Friends </em>played in the background, Rio half-listening, only tuning in at the juicy parts like Ross and Rachel fighting in the early seasons when he cheated on her. Rio hated Ross. Never liked him. Never would. She had just gotten to the part where the rest of the gang, all trapped in Monica’s bedroom, were left to eat the wax when her phone rang. Agatha had jumped, her head lifting up, staring at it on the table and allowing Rio to stretch for it before burying her face back into her skin, her hand joining Rio’s on her stomach. She stared at her phone surprised. </p><p>It was her sister. </p><p>“Oriana?” she had questioned when she answered it. </p><p>Her sister had practically squealed in excitement before rambling on about how she moved out of the place she shared with Maria finally and bought a new house. Where? A ten minute drive from her and Agatha. As her sister droned on, Rio was planning when to call their real estate agent. Her wife and she had already talked about getting a bigger house, but that also meant redoing the nursery they both worked so hard on. The plan was already in motion though. They would move when Nicholas was around two, weaned off of breastmilk, and hopefully, easy to handle. Agatha won the fight when it came to the moving people– Rio and her would barely lift a finger and it would go faster– which her wife argued was what they needed for Nicholas if he inherited <em> Rio’s </em>impatience… Rio didn’t fight, but they both knew her wife meant her own impatience. Rio was as patient as a cosmic entity. Her wife… was as impatient as a dragon, especially now. </p><p>Lost in her thoughts, she didn’t even realize her wife had taken over talking, her voice soft, quiet, hot breath against her neck, and then her wrist was being dragged closer to her face as her sister politely asked for Agatha to speak up. </p><p>“Sorry, but yes, we’ll be there after the appointment tomorrow.”</p><p>Rio had froze, staring down at the phone as her sister practically squealed, making both of them wince, “Perfect! I’ll have lunch ready– <em> Abuelita’s </em> arroz con gandules and oh, Agatha, I have a pool– don’t worry I did research. You will be fine to swim and <em> Abuelita </em>said it will help with your back by lifting the weight from you.” </p><p>Her wife chuckled, “That would be great, Ori. We will see you tomorrow.” </p><p>
<em> “​​Adiós!”  </em>
</p><p>So that’s how Rio was in their truck, hospital bags packed just in case– despite the doctor saying she was fine today– and her wife humming to Phoebe Bridgers next to her, either completely oblivious or ignoring the frustration rolling off of Rio in waves. Perhaps she was overreacting, and that thought was like a bucket of ice water splashing over her head. If something happened– if Agatha went into her labor– Agatha would communicate with her, or Rio would easily read it off her body language. Despite what others thought, Agatha was a fairly easy read… well…</p><p>Okay, despite being with her wife for almost fifteen years, when her wife put up her walls, it was a little more difficult… but Rio has been doing fine for now. But if she knew one thing for sure about her wife– Agatha Harkness didn’t make anything easy. </p><p>As she pulled up into the driveway with the address of her sister’s new home, a hand fell onto her thigh, caressing her softly. Turning off the truck, her eyes glanced over and immediately, the bricks she carried on her shoulders crumbled. Blue eyes were soft, warm, calming– enchanting her to breathe normally as her eyes wandered her wife’s figure. The braid Rio braided that morning sat heavy on her shoulder, moving over heavy breasts, and resting over the large baby bump that sat lower than usual, even jutting out slightly. The pool would do wonders for her wife’s back, and part of Rio wondered if that was the only reason why they were here– Agatha using her sister… it was so her wife that the very thought made her chuckle as her hand smoothed over the bump, her cheeks stretching feeling the excited kicks from within. </p><p>“<em> Cálmate, mi amor. </em>He still got two weeks left to cook in there,” her wife smiled, making Rio’s gaze land on the crinkles of the corners of her eyes. </p><p>She wanted to kiss them, instead, she met her wife’s lips before getting out of the truck. She hurried around, lifting her wife out with ease, placing her on her feet before smoothing out the purple sun dress– a black nylon swimsuit peaking out from underneath. Agatha leaned against her, a habit she had picked up lately, which Rio didn’t mind. If it brought her comfort, then so be it– her wife already slept with her stomach completely on Rio– and all night, right along with her wife until she was asleep, she felt their son doing target practice on her wife’s organs. </p><p> </p><p>Oriana was quick to greet them outside, ushering them in. Inside, the interior was a mix of blues and beige, the walls decorated with shells and paintings of bays filled with ships, seagulls, and even the classic white and red lighthouse. Rio and Agatha eyed each other as Oriana droned out, squealing when showing them something exciting, and humming to herself in the halls as she even showed Rio her bedroom. With a language of their own, Agatha and Rio judged in silence– Oriana’s house looked as if a Pinterest board called “Sanctuary of the Sea: Sea House Decor” threw up in it. And yet… as they did judge, covering their mocking laughs with coughs, or her wife saying it was the baby– they were secretly proud. </p><p>They knew– Rio especially– how controlling Maria was, and living with Maria– forget about even having an opinion. Growing up, the twins shared everything: a room, clothes, makeup, shoes– anything you can name they shared. When they went to college, they were roommates, and after college, they got a house together… but Maria decorated everything– even Oriana’s own room in the house. So, for the first time, Oriana was able to choose for herself. </p><p>“I was even thinking of making one of the guest rooms a playroom for my <em> sobrino, </em>” her sister smiled as they headed to the back porch. </p><p>Her wife stiffened beside her and Rio didn’t even have to look at her wife to know her maternal, overprotective instincts were firing. </p><p>“That sounds perfect, Ori, but don’t change your home for us– plus he is not even here yet. We aren’t even sure what he will like.” </p><p>Her sister’s eyes still sparkled, becoming golden thanks to the sun as her wife squeezed her hand, staring at the pool excitedly. </p><p>“Whenever, of course, <em> Riocita,” </em> Oriana nodded and clapped her hands together, squealing with excitement. “Ohh, I can’t wait to see him. He’s going to come out looking like you, <em> Riocita, </em> but I hope those blue eyes, Agatha– but if he’s Rio’s copy-and-paste, he is going to love dragons and dinosaurs. He will roll in mud, bring you bones he finds in the woods probably– <em> Abuelita </em>used to scream when Rio found skulls and brought them home–”</p><p>“You did <em> what </em>?” her wife hissed, swirling around to level her with a sharp glare. </p><p> Rio chuckled low in her chest, rubbing the back of her neck like a child caught red-handed. </p><p>“They were cool skulls. One was a snake. The other might’ve been an iguana. And I washed them.”</p><p> “With what, bleach and bad decisions?” Agatha snapped, though the edge in her voice was dulled by the amusement twitching at the corner of her mouth. </p><p>“Don’t give her that look, Agatha,” Oriana piped in with a smirk. “She used to swear they were dragon bones. Would cry if you said otherwise.”</p><p> “And I was right,” Rio grinned, leading her wife down the stone path toward the patio lined with a glass table, loungers, and softer seats. “You’ve just never had vision.” </p><p>Agatha snorted and leaned into her, holding Rio’s arm for balance as they stepped into the shade of a wide umbrella. Her breathing had grown more labored in recent days, each motion slower, more deliberate. The odd summer heat in spring made the stray hairs cling to her sweat streaked neck, pooling there before a few drops ran from her forehead. Rio gently nudged a lounger with her foot and sat her wife down, kneeling to remove her sandals.</p><p>“The water should take some weight from you, <em> mi amor </em>,” she murmured, already rubbing lotion up her legs. </p><p>Her wife didn’t reply, just tilted her head, watching the few clouds in the sky, but flinched when the cool cream was placed on her belly. Rio rubbed it in, smiling as her son took the opportunity to push against her, almost as if he could also feel how cold the lotion was compared to the sun. Once her wife’s delicate pale skin was lathered in protection, she guided her wife to the shallow end. Both of them grew silent as Agatha slipped into the water with a low sigh of relief. The tension in her shoulders melted almost instantly, her body floating into weightlessness, the braid half sinking, half floating– long and delicate like a mermaid’s.</p><p>Rio crouched at the edge, arms crossed on her knees, watching every flicker of ease that returned to her wife’s face. Her gaze lowered, staring at the crack of her breasts peaking from the black bikini top and before her eyes could travel more– water drenched her, soaking her clothes that she had over top of her own black and white checkered bikini. The water was a wake up call… a really rude one as she spit out what had fallen into her mouth. </p><p>“<em> Ay Riocito– </em> I will have a repeat of <em> that </em>morning in my own pool. Stop eye-fucking your wife,” her sister scolded her as Agatha laughed, the sweet harmony echoing around the backyard. </p><p>Despite being closer to her mid-thirties, Rio was always a child at heart. Quick as a flash and faster than thought, she reached behind her, grabbed Oriana’s ankle, then snatched at her sister’s waist, fingers curled into the hem of her t-shirt. With a single practiced tug, she yanked her down into the water. A great wave erupted, dousing them all. Agatha threw her head back, laughter snorting bright and unrestrained over Oriana’s sputtering protests. Rio leaned back on her hands, the sun glinting off her wet skin, watching her sister rise like a furious sea creature. Oriana’s neatly cropped pixie cut now clung to her forehead in damp defeat. </p><p>Wiping her eyes just in time for another splash to hit her full in the face, Oriana barked, “Still a fucking child, <em> hermanita </em>.” </p><p>Rio merely stuck out her tongue in reply, raising a finger, and drawing another snort from Agatha, who now reclined in the water like a queen in her court, amused and untouchable. Rio watched her, seeing the water lift her, cradling so carefully as her belly floated with ease. Rio went to move, to the t-shirt clinging to her skin so she could wade in towards her wife. Instead, a wave crashed into her before the air vanished. Chlorinated water filled her mouth and nose. Her limbs thrashed as her lungs screamed, her sister’s surprisingly strong hands pushing her under with a vengeance honed by years of actual sibling rivalry. But Rio was stronger and with ease, she gripped Oriana’s waist, lifted her life dead weight, and slammed her back beneath the surface as she surged up, gasping. Laughter clawed up her throat between coughs– but her sister was already back, dragging her under again, making her nose burn. </p><p>For a moment, the world became a swirl of bubbles and muffled joy, the rhythm of breath and water blurring into chaos. At last, Rio couldn’t take it anymore, her lungs protesting as she lifted her sister off of her, throwing her away from her. She pushed off the bottom of the pool like a seal, gliding toward the queen who floated with her hands holding her stomach, watching her court jesters with an amused smirk. </p><p>Rio came behind her, arms around her waist as she pulled her back against her chest, kissing her neck softly as her sister surfaced, gasping for breath. She smirked, happily using her wife as a double human shield, knowing it would work as Oriana approached. </p><p>“Splash me, and you’re not meeting your nephew for a year and that pixie cut ends up floating in the pool,” her wife snapped, her eyes blazing at her sister who raised her hands up in surrender. </p><p>“<em> Mierda, </em> no wonder she tamed you, <em> hermanita,” </em>Oriana grumbled. </p><p>Her wife only raised an eyebrow unimpressed as Rio chuckled, “Well, she has no problem splashing me in–” </p><p>An elbow found her stomach, taking the breath from her. She clung to her wife tighter, hiding from pointy elbows as her wife happily leaned back against her, “Finish that sentence, my love. Go on.”</p><p>Rio didn’t fall into the taunting, knowing to keep her mouth shut as her sister chuckled underneath her breath. </p><p>Agatha only groaned, rubbing her stomach, “He senses your stupidity, by the way. He was perfectly still before.”</p><p>Her sister smirked, floating out like a starfish, “Just wait till you two give him a sibling. It will be pure chaos.”<br/>
“It already is,” her wife huffed.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b>***</b>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p> </p><p>She leaned back in the pool, the weight finally off her back as her belly had her float like a buoy. She bobbed up and down slightly and only left the pool to use the bathroom or when her sister-in-law brought food. The flutterings and kicks underneath tight skin eased up, her son only reacting when his <em> mami </em>laughed or was close by, talking to him softly. But her plan was working out perfectly. Although Rio had loosened up, not as freaked out as she forced her and her wife to go out on dates, each time getting less and less protests and excuses, Rio needed someone to remind her to let go. Oriana was perfect for that… plus she had a pool. So win-win. </p><p>And now, everything was explicitly going to plan. She floated in the water as the sun began to set and up on the patio her wife and Oriana were talking lowly, Agatha pretending she wasn’t listening to them. </p><p>“<em> Lo estás haciendo bien, Riocita. Tu esposa tiene suerte de tenerte. </em> ” (You are doing fine, <em> Riocita </em>. Your wife is so lucky to have you.)</p><p>Rio shook her head, swallowing hard, <em> “Pero, ¿Y si no suy suficiente para ella o él? Ori– </em>”  (But what if I’m not enough for her or him. Ori–)</p><p>Her older sister snapped, “<em> A la mierda, Rio– ¿si quiera te escuchas? Tienes cuatro malditos bolsos para el hospital preparados, tu esposa me dijo cuántas aplicaciones tienes en el teléfono, y no quiero saber cuántos cuadernos tienes llenos de anotaciones.  ¿Qué? ¿Acaso contactaste a una enfermera privada también– ¡No es una invitación para hacerlo! </em>” (Fucking hell, Rio– do you even hear yourself? You have four fucking hospital bags packed, your wife told me how many fucking apps are on your phone, and do I even want know how many notebooks your probably have filled with notes. What? Did you contact a labor and delivery nurse too– That is not an invitation to do so!)</p><p>Oriana took a deep breath, sitting up, but not touching her little sister, a boundary finally listened to. </p><p>“<em> Riocita, vas a ser una madre tan increíble, solo necesitas tomar aire y calmar el maldito culo. No va a ser fácil, maldición, tú sola casi volvías alcohólica a Abuelita. Pero tú y tu esposa son un gran equipo. Se tienen la una a la otra y eso será suficiente. Tendrán sus altos y bajos– momentos dónde ninguna de las dos estará segura de que lo que hagan es perfecto– pero ese es el punto... ambas intentarán ser perfectas para él y eso es todo lo que necesita– que ustedes intenten. Pero no hasta el punto en que mueras del cansancio. Solo respira, hermanita. Y cuando Agatha este dando a luz estarás ahí para ella. Solo llévala a tiempo al hospital.” </em> ( <em> Riocita </em> , you are going to be such an amazing mother if you just take a deep breath and chill the fuck out. It’s not going to be easy– hell, you alone could have sent <em> Abuelita </em> into drinking. But you and your wife are such an amazing team. You have each other and that is what is going to be enough. You will have your ups and downs– moments where you both are not sure what you are doing is perfect– but that’s the whole point… you both will try to be perfect for him and that’s all he could ever want– is for you both to try. But not to the point where you tire yourself out. So just breathe, little sister. And when Agatha goes into labor, you will be there for her. Just get her to the hospital in time.)</p><p>They both laughed at the end, but Agatha’s stomach dropped at that. </p><p>
<em> The hospital.  </em>
</p><p>Something rose inside her, a feeling that clawed at the very recesses of her mind. She hated hospitals and she thanked her dearest dead mother for that. She breathed out heavily, panic crawling up her chest at the thought of bright fluorescent lights shining down at her as doctors and nurses worked between her legs. She swallowed down the bile that rose, Nicky kicking at her with her nerves rising. Her mind flashed back to the lonely nights left there. Her mother never came with her, leaving her alone to the white coats… okay, yeah– she definitely had white coat syndrome– unless her wife was in a white lab coat and then she would happily jump her. But she couldn’t bear the idea of sitting in a hospital, pacing under too many watchful eyes, too many people probing at her vagina– even more compared to when her and Rio got their bone marrow and then their eggs ready– at least her wife would carry the next. A lab somewhere had both her eggs and her wife’s eggs fertilized with each other’s bone sperm in a freezer. </p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrowed as the sensation didn’t leave her. Conflict made her eyebrows crease as her son fluttered beneath her skin. She knew she had to go– Hela already talked about the wonders of epidurals and drugs. She would need them– and she was not going to have her son rip open her vagina without them…but that also meant telling her wife when she was in pain and Agatha hated admitting pain. Again, blame it on the dead cunt of a mother. She half wished her mother was cremated so she could flush Evanora’s remains into the city sewer. But that would be offensive to the sewer. </p><p>Her wife was still talking Spanish with her sister, but she seemed calmer, her shoulders no longer tense, her whole body falling into the chair instead in a position where she was always ready to leap up for her. Something in Agatha softened, the feeling gnawing at her quieting as she stared at the way her wife tilted her head, absentmindedly playing with her fingers– she was everything. Maybe, for once, Agatha would be alright going to the hospital as long as Rio was there by her side. And she knew her wife would rather die than to leave her. Perhaps that could be enough. </p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Two weeks passed in a blur for Agatha. Her wife was hovering less, but there when she needed her, and oh how it made Agatha’s heart ache in such a way as she watched her wife slowly step into a place of calm and readiness. She was no longer frantic, no longer always on the edge of the seat, and she finally listened when Agatha told her when she was fine. She still was there when Agatha needed her ankles or back rubbed, still glued to the bump when she could, talking to their son, singing to him in hushed Spanish lullabies. She still held her when she slept and gave up whatever she was doing the moment Agatha raised a hand at her to join her in bed or on the couch. She didn’t press when Agatha was moody and waited to be told what to do when the baby kicked too hard or Braxton Hicks hit her. Usually, Agatha would send Rio away in the middle of the practice contractions, but the moment they were gone, she demanded that Rio hold her tight, which she did without question every time. </p><p>Oriana’s talk with her wife worked… maybe a little <em> too </em> well. </p><p> </p><p>It was two days after her due date, May sixteenth– and no sign of <em> conejito </em> making his appearance. The OBGYN even commented that she hadn’t even started to dilate but not to worry. Agatha fucking did– more-so, she wanted him out. She was tired, her back still hurt, and she wanted to see her feet. She already made her wife trim her down there to feel more comfortable. Every position was uncomfortable, not to mention she was peeing all the damn time. She refused anyone from coming over to their house, even Lilia– but Rio wasn’t safe from her either. Although her wife never strayed far, Agatha couldn’t help but yell as if she were across the house. Her wife would simply walk in with that stupid ass puppy dog look, kiss her sweetly, before doing whatever she grumbled out at her wife. </p><p>Rio, her sweet darling Rio, who really only wanted to help, tried suggesting sex or masturbating– a natural way to induce labor according to every gods be damned website, app, and their OB. For once, Agatha didn’t like that idea. She didn’t like the idea that it was only to get him out– and she really couldn’t get in the mood for even Rio’s mouth…</p><p>And yet, even when Agatha lasted another day without contractions or their son ripping his way through her vagina, Rio was calm. Maybe it was because Agatha was not. Maybe that helped, something clicking in her wife’s brain that the moment Rio started freaking out with her, Agatha would actually lose it. Instead, Rio was just a call away or really right there, watching her mess with the nursery, pace the hallway before sitting down and passing out wherever she pleased. She basically hand fed Agatha food, trying to get her to eat when it felt like her nerves wouldn’t let her. </p><p>So, May sixteenth was no different… except it was, because the pain rolling through her definitely was not Braxton Hicks. </p><p>It had been happening all day, and yet she kept trying to convince herself they were just Braxton Hicks. They were uneven, neither of them lasting the same amount of time, but they grew stronger, each cramp tightening her stomach, making her breathless as it traveled around her midsection. She stayed somewhat hidden in their window seat, holding onto Señor Scratchy or a pillow, muffling her groans from her wife who was now currently making dinner for them. </p><p>She had time, she <em>knew </em>she did. Agatha had taken Rio’s phone, going through her apps and double checking about the 5-1-1 rule : contractions <b>five</b> minutes apart, they are about <b>one</b> minute long, and the pattern had been consistent for at least <b>one</b> hour. From what she timed they were only thirty to four seconds long and well, there was more than twenty minutes between them… well, now there was only fifteen minutes between this one and the last. </p><p>“<em> Mi amor?” </em>a voice made her snap her eyes up as the contraction eased off. </p><p>She met chocolate ones glowing down at her with patience and worry. Rio was in her normal sweats and a green wife-beater shirt, her hair pinned in a claw clip out of the way. Behind her the table was already set, a candle glowing low and warm tea steeping. And yet, Agatha could barely concentrate on the perfect smell of beef and thyme that was filling their home. It felt as if her insides were tearing apart. </p><p>“Mm,” she hummed, stretching out lazing as if she were trying to get comfortable– but that was futile. </p><p>Her wife cocked her head, stepping forward to sit on the edge of the green cushion, “Dinner is ready. Do you want to eat, <em> cariño </em>?” </p><p>Agatha took a deep breath in, able to calm herself as the contraction passed. She was fine. He was fine. They would be fine… unless it happened in five minutes. She reached forward, allowing her wife to stand her up before taking her hand and leading her to her seat where she sat down, staring at the potatoes, roast, and noodles. Before she could move to serve herself, Rio already had the ladle, making, luckily, a small bowl for her to eat at first. </p><p>“Just small bites, <em> mi amor,” </em>her wife murmured before yawning. </p><p>Right, Rio was just as exhausted as she was. They both have been surviving on barely any sleep. When Nicholas kicks her bladder, Agatha is jolted awake and hurries to the bathroom which in the process wakes up her wife, no matter how hard she tries to be quiet or not jostle the bed while simultaneously trying to make it in time. Her wife always woke, Rio reaching out to her the moment she stepped out of the bathroom to hold her. And when she would fall asleep, she was sure their son was kicking Rio, keeping her up a little longer before falling asleep and the cycle repeating itself. Only a few times during the day did Rio nap, but her gaze was always on her, always worried, but calm. </p><p>Agatha reached across the table, finding Rio’s hand and threading their non-dominant fingers together, grounding herself in the quiet warmth of skin and gold. The dim light caught her wife’s wedding band, making it glint like a small star between them. Rio blinked slowly, owlish and tired, her fork idly stirring the food in her bowl without lifting it. Agatha lifted their joined hands to her lips, brushing a tender kiss across her knuckles. </p><p>“My love,” she murmured, voice low and sure, “you need to sleep tonight.” </p><p>Rio straightened, blinking out of her drowsy haze. </p><p>“So do you,” she countered gently, always ready to match her in stubbornness. </p><p>Agatha smiled softly, shaking her head. </p><p>“We both know your son won’t let me,” she said, her tone almost amused.</p><p> She took a bite, chewed, and spoke around the weariness they both carried like extra limbs. </p><p>“One of us needs to be rested for when he finally decides to arrive. Please, my love. I promise I’ll wake you when it’s real.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, accepting the truce. She drew her hand back to rest it against Agatha’s belly, her palm open, fingers splayed as if trying to commune with the quiet storm beneath the skin. </p><p>“He’s taking his time,” she murmured. “I thought he would’ve been here by now.” </p><p>Agatha gave a crooked smile, eyes heavy-lidded but warm. </p><p>“Who’s ever truly ready to face this world?” she reached to rest her hand over Rio’s. “At least he has you.” </p><p>Rio looked up, meeting her gaze. “He has us, <em> cariño– </em>” </p><p><em> Thump </em>. </p><p>The sound cracked through the air like a punctuation mark. They both turned their heads toward the floor, where Señor Scratchy sat, twitching with conviction. A breath of laughter escaped them at the same time. Agatha watched as the rabbit bounded forward, pausing beside her chair with theatrical determination before thumping again– louder this time, pointed. The message was clear: <em> something’s coming </em>. </p><p>“Fine, you too, Señor,” her wife said dryly. </p><p>But the rabbit wasn’t done. He rose on his hind legs, tiny forepaws pawing at her lap, eyes fixed with eerie focus on her belly. His nose twitched in an urgent staccato. Then he tried to leap into her, frantic and unwavering. Agatha went stiff. </p><p><em> He knows </em>. </p><p>Her hands hovered like she might push him away– or confess. Because Scratchy was about to blow her cover. He knew something was shifting, and he was seconds away from outing her to Rio before she was ready to say the words herself. </p><p>He was frantic, bunny nose twitching before looking straight up at her wife, as if to say, <em> You dumb bitch, she’s in pain. </em></p><p>Carefully, Agatha eased him back to the floor. Rio narrowed her eyes, sighing as she bent to reach for him.</p><p>“What’s up with him?” </p><p>The rabbit thumped once more, indignant, his fluffy body vibrating with determination. His ears stood tall, every inch of him alert and bristling with warning.</p><p>Agatha sat up straighter, flicking the braid behind her, “He probably smells the carrots, or he’s not getting enough attention lately. Maybe you should put him in his pen.” </p><p>Her wife stood, scooping up the rabbit, but not before he could land another thump in protest. </p><p><em> Shithead, she’s going into labor soon, </em>he would say if he could speak. </p><p>To Agatha’s luck, the rabbit couldn’t and exactly then– seventeen minutes after the last– a contraction hit. Agatha dropped her fork, letting it clatter into her bowl, bending over slightly as she breathed through it. Her eyes were on her wife though, who walked Señor Scratchy into the living room where they moved his pen into. He squeaked, fighting Rio but it provided her enough time to compose herself and start eating again. </p><p>When Rio returned, she was none the wiser. Their hands intertwined as they ate, drifting in and out of soft-spoken dreams– murmured plans of the future, too delicate to name aloud. Afterward, they cleaned up together, Stevie Nicks curling through the air like incense, her voice settling into the corners of their quiet kitchen. Agatha dried the dishes, humming under her breath, hiding the contraction that rolled in thirty minutes later. But it was fine. Nothing to worry about. It wasn’t active labor. Not even early labor. Too short, too spaced out. And so, with practiced denial, Agatha filed them neatly away: Braxton Hicks. Again. Still. </p><p><em> Everything is fine, </em> nodded to herself in her head <em> . Just strange Braxton Hicks. Not labor. No hospitals yet.  </em></p><p>Then came the first few notes– eighth notes of a piano– echoing into the air like a breath held too long. They both paused, glancing toward each other as they set the last dish down. </p><p>Keane’s voice rose like a memory : “<em> I walked across an empty land. I knew the pathway like the back of my hand… </em>” </p><p>Without a word, Rio reached out, her hand settling low on Agatha’s waist, steady and warm. She drew her in gently. Agatha let out a soft laugh, her rounded belly pressing between them as she looped her arms around her wife’s neck. Together, they swayed, singing quietly into the space between their lips. Normally, Rio would twirl her, dip her, lift her off her feet with that effortless strength and delight– but not tonight. Tonight, she simply held her close, like gravity had chosen to settle between them instead of the earth. Their lips met in the middle, tender and sure, their own language unfurling between each brush of mouth to mouth. The music dissolved into a hum behind them, as if even the song had stepped back to give them room. Agatha tilted her head, deepening the kiss, noses brushing, breath shared. Her body responded instinctively– heat blooming through her chest, her heart pounding so loudly it seemed to ricochet inside her ribs, searching for Rio’s in the dark. </p><p>But just as her tongue pushed into the kiss, another ‘false’ contraction gripped her abdomen. Her breath caught. She gasped against Rio’s mouth– but masked it with a moan, too smooth to question. Her tongue flicked hastily into the kiss, tangling with Rio’s, trying to ground herself in sensation instead of pain. She took a shaky breath, pulled away just enough to swallow, then leaned back in, lips crashing into hers once more, tongue sweeping deep, searching for something to hold on to. Rio made a soft noise in return, her hand sliding up to cradle the back of Agatha’s head.</p><p>And then it came in almost as sharp and fast as the Braxton Hicks, pooling low in her belly– desire. She tugged her wife closer, moaning softly into her mouth as they tasted each other like they were starved. Their tongues battled and danced a rhythm only they knew, speaking easily as Agatha’s mind raced. </p><p>Why did ever think she didn’t want Rio’s mouth on her? Rio’s mouth and tongue were blessed by the gods. What the fuck was wrong with her? </p><p>She needed her now, and there was only one way to be absolutely sure she would get what she wanted. Her mouth worked against Rio’s before moving down caramel skin, tasting her before her teeth were scraping, biting into that perfect jaw line and leaving indents. Her wife gasped against her before moaning lowly as Agatha took her tongue, licking one long stripe down her neck. </p><p>
<em> She had her. </em>
</p><p>Large black pupils stared down at her, her mouth hung open where she could just see the bottom of those gaped teeth. She grabbed Rio’s hand, guiding her to their bedroom. Just as she turned around, lips were on her, hands on her hips before going to her stomach. She sighed, her head tilting back, lips were on her neck, teeth nipping and tongue soothing. Her own hands travelled her wife’s body, moving under the tank, her fingers clawing down the ripple of abs. Rio groaned low in her throat, a sound that came from deep inside. </p><p>“You’re trying to kill me,” she murmured, dragging her mouth along Agatha’s collarbone. Agatha tilted her hips just enough to tease. </p><p>“If I was trying,” she whispered. “You’d already be dead.” </p><p>Rio’s laugh was breathless, hands gliding down over the swell of Agatha’s belly. She rested them underneath it, half holding it as her lips glided back up again, slow, sure. Hands moved underneath the oversized band tee, her mouth hovering at the edge of a moan. </p><p>“You’re sure, <em> mi amor </em>?” she asked, voice rough, but her touch was already moving, pulling at the hem of her panties. “It’s just you said–” </p><p>Agatha grabbed her chin harshly, forcing her wife to look up at her, “If I ever say I don’t want your mouth on me again– double check that it’s not more than pregnancy brain.”</p><p>Her wife nodded, swallowing hard as her very finger tips on her naval sent sparks up through her body. Agatha smirked, pulling at Rio’s tank before she complied, taking it off to reveal her bare chest. Her hands reached up, squeezing at her wife’s breasts, her fingers spreading in a V, and squeezing a hard nipple in place. Chuckling as her wife moaned, she felt her panties being peeled down her legs, the gusset cold and wet, caressing down her inner thigh before landing on the ground with a soft thud. She wasn’t given time to breathe before fingers were working through her labia, slipping through easily as her own hands grasped for purchase– already so close to the edge.  </p><p>Agatha laid a hand on her wife’s chest and panted, “Not inside, love.”</p><p>Hands went to her waist again, walking her backward until the back of her knees were hitting the bed. Rio was kissing her like it was their last, her fingers playing with her swollen clit as she moaned into her mouth. Agatha’s mind blanked, everything becoming hazy as pleasure took over. Rio didn’t let her sit though, not yet– the hand on her waist moved to her back, holding her in place as her fingers worked. Her head rested against Agatha’s when she pulled her mouth away– a line of spit connecting them. Agatha panted and whimpered into her mouth, struggling to keep her eyes open, her legs shaking, but her wife merely lowered the hand on her back, palming her ass to keep her upright and close. </p><p>“Fuck– yeah– Rio, right there– oh my fuck, yes!” </p><p>It didn’t take long. In fact, it was probably the quickest she’d ever come from just clitoral stimulation. Her orgasm hit hard, brutal and fierce, her head tilting back as she clenched around nothing, her wife’s fingers slowing but never leaving– guiding her gently through the aftershocks. Her arms instinctively wrapped around Rio’s neck, holding on as tremors wracked her body, her knees giving out beneath her. That’s when Rio lowered her, slow and tenderly, as if she were spun from glass, easing her onto the bed with care. But Agatha didn’t let go. She clung to her wife, burying her face in the crook of her neck, nuzzling in with a sigh as the last ache dissolved like mist in the morning sun. </p><p><em> See </em>? She was fine. </p><p>Warm lips pressed to her temple. A gentle hand found her belly and rubbed in slow, tender circles. </p><p>“Let me take care of you, <em> cariño </em>,” Rio whispered. </p><p>And who was Agatha to deny her wife that? </p><p>She hummed softly as Rio’s lips traced lower, down the slope of her throat. Her arms slipped around Rio’s back, holding her close, grounding herself in the worship of her body. Her head tilted, offering her neck like an invitation, her moan barely more than breath. </p><p>“What do you want, <em> cariño </em>?” Rio murmured into her skin, the words a vibration that seemed to ripple straight to her core. </p><p>Agatha pulled back just enough to catch her wife’s chin, guiding her gaze up until their eyes locked. </p><p>“Your mouth, baby,” she whispered, her voice sultry and deep. “Don’t stop until I tell you to.” </p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate. She reached for their pillows, arranging them carefully around Agatha, cradling her like royalty in a throne of down. Her smirk was playful, reverent, but hungry. She peeled the t-shirt from Agatha’s body, trailing kisses across her breasts, her palms cupping and lifting them with care. She pinched her nipples just enough to draw a sharp gasp, Agatha’s back arching high before she sank back into the sea of plush. Her wife hummed in delight. </p><p>Agatha kept moaning, soft and blissful, smiling faintly as she felt how the pillows relieved the pressure from her spine. Rio’s mouth moved with unhurried devotion, lathing at the underside of her breasts, her fingers still teasing and tugging. </p><p>“Mmm, so perfect, <em> mi amor,” </em>Rio hummed, pitching her nipples again. “So big and full–” </p><p>Agatha’s hand struck like a viper, wrapping around her wife’s throat, but not squeezing, just a quiet authority, “What did I say?”</p><p>Each word was slow and measured, but controlled as the uncomfortable feeling in her gut rolled in again. It took everything in her not to reveal the silent pain behind her eyes, and she almost breathed out in relief when her wife nodded obediently. Rio descended like a knight ordered by her queen on a mission, her mouth hot and insistent, but kissing gently down the expanse of her stomach before burying her face between her legs. Agatha’s head fell back, her thighs already tight around Rio’s checks as her fingers twisted in black silk. Rio’s mouth consumed her so perfectly, her breath hot as her tongue explored every tiny nerve, lavishing over her, making her whole body grow taunt. She started around her labia, sucking each fold into her mouth before teasing her clit. Agatha’s hips bucked, her whole body flying as Rio swallowed everything she had to give her. </p><p>She whimpered and moaned with each warm stroke of that tongue, hands clinging to her thighs, hanging on to her before Agatha reached for her wife’s hand. Rio took it, squeezing it– something to say she was here– Agatha was safe. The pressure in her stomach was building up quickly– too quickly as the coil became tighter and tighter.</p><p>“Just like that– yeah– yeah– uhh Rio!” </p><p>It wasn’t a snap. It was an explosion, the wrong wire cut, causing everything in her to fly. Her head flew back as her thighs clamped harshly around wife’s head. Whatever was left of her nails dug into Rio’s head and hand as she was floating in the Northern Lights– waves of green and purple encasing her body, numbing everything. When she floated down, she felt it, her body squirting straight into her wife’s waiting mouth, and her wife didn’t stop– she just swallowed. </p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Agatha woke with a jolt.</p><p>A pulse of pain tore through her lower belly, sharp and sudden, dragging a gasp from her lips as she sat up too fast. Her hands flew to her stomach, cradling it, as if she could hold the pain in– keep it from blooming outward like fire on dry grass. She was trembling before she even realized it, the quaking of her body beyond her command. Around her, the bedroom was still and dark, soft with the hush of the witching hour. Beside her, Rio slept deeply, her breathing loud and steady– nearly a snore– after days of sleepless nights keeping watch over her. Agatha turned her head, watching her for a moment. Guilt tangled with fear in her chest, but the pain returned before she could dwell in either. </p><p>This one was worse. It slammed into her like a prizefighter, the kind with cinderblocks for fists. She doubled over, biting back a cry, her braid slipping over her shoulder as she reached up to push hair from her face. The motion made her dizzy. Her legs swung off the bed and touched the floor like they didn’t belong to her anymore. She stood– or tried to. Her knees buckled slightly. Her back curled with the force of the contraction, and she hobbled toward the door, each step unsteady. The robe clung to her thighs, bunched awkwardly as she fumbled for the knob, opened the door, and slipped out into the hall. She closed it gently behind her, leaning heavily against the wall. She breathed through her mouth, desperate to find a rhythm, but her nose felt useless. Nothing about this pain was orderly. It stretched on, a minute that felt like ten, stealing the air from her lungs and the strength from her bones. When it finally let her go, her muscles sagged with relief. But then– </p><p>Warmth. It was lazy, a trickle that ran down her thighs slowly, as if purposely leaving its mark down and down her legs. She blinked down through blurred vision, through tears she hadn’t noticed until now. Liquid was racing down her legs like ran against a widow, darkening the hem of her robe, and trickling to the wooden floor. </p><p><em> Okay, so I just peed myself. That’s… embarrassing, </em> she thought as she panted, but she was already moving towards the kitchen. <em> Water, rest and wait to see if it’s actually happening, wake Rio. Water, rest, Rio. Water, rest, Rio. </em></p><p>It was a mantra… it was a life line. One that didn’t make sense, one that had to hold on to as the glass in her hand trembled violently under the running water of the sink. She didn’t care as her hand refused to remain steady, shaking the water out from it– splattering to the floor. But that was okay…she was hoping… something… would be cool…</p><p>something… </p><p>anything to stop the sweat pouring down her face and her teeth from chattering… </p><p>she was so hot… </p><p>and– </p><p>the glass fell from her hand, shattering to the floor with a loud crash. </p><p>The pain was burning, shooting all around her pelvis, like a thousand tiny lava infused fire ants were eating her from the inside out. She stumbled around the center counter top, freezing as it grew sharper, the pressure too much as she yelled out, leaning back against the counter and clutching her stomach, possibly lower like she could reach inside herself to stop it all. She barely even processed the loud bang from their bedroom, or the slight squeak of a foot sliding on the hardwood. All she knew was that he was coming, and she needed her wife <em> now. </em></p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>Rio </b>
</p><p> </p><p>A loud crash of glass had Rio up in seconds. Her heart was hammering in her throat, choking her. Her hands reached beside her, searching for the woman she wrapped in a robe after she fell asleep right after her fifth orgasm. She had just lifted her head a little after her wife came down, and found her breathing in deeply before snoring. Rio had smiled, maneuvered her wife into a robe before lifting her properly into bed and passing out the moment her head hit pillows. </p><p>But now she was gone, the sheets left to be wrapped around her legs as her eyes looked to the bathroom, before a loud yell made her heart almost stop. She was moving before her brain even caught up, finding her tank and putting it on as she kicked at the sheets. Rio crawled across their bed frantically, crashing to the floor as the sheets acted like a snare. She didn’t care as her shoulder throbbed, her body rolling over itself before she was up, tearing off their bedroom door as she saw the kitchen light was on. She froze for a moment, eyes searching for Agatha before another scream tore through the house. </p><p>Rio stepped in something wet, her foot gliding forward as she steadied herself with the wall. She stared down at the trail on the floor, her breathing becoming hard as her eyes widened.</p><p>Agatha’s water had broken.  </p><p>She was in labor.</p><p>Their son was coming. </p><p><em> Hospital </em>. </p><p>Rio ran forward, finding her wife leaning against the kitchen counter, clutching her stomach before looking up. Sweat drenched her, her hair was soaked and in wild tangles, the braid lost as her robe hung on her shoulders, no longer tied. Blue eyes were electric, wide with panic as hair covered her face, staring at her. </p><p>“No, no– it can’t be,” her wife groaned. </p><p>That’s all it took.</p><p>Rio was before Agatha in seconds, taking her hands, trying to guide her to her feet, trying to get her at least through the front door first so she could grab their hospital bags there. But her wife protested, tears heavy down her cheeks as she screamed this time, piercing Rio’s ears as her grip grew tight enough to break her hands.</p><p>“Ri– Rio,” Agatha breathed out before groaning and whimpering. “I want more time– I want more time.”  </p><p>Rio felt herself recede, burying her panicking self to the very depths of her being as adrenaline kicked in. She lowered herself to the floor without another word, moving the ends of the robe away and there… </p><p>Oh. </p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em> Oh.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>That… </p><p> </p><p>that was a head… </p><p> </p><p>a head full of black hair… </p><p> </p><p>her wife was crowning…</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was crowning…</p><p> </p><p>Nicholas was coming now. </p><p> </p><p>Rio froze, everything in her body and her breath caught. She couldn’t breathe. She couldn’t think. She tried to remember what to do, anything– but it was all lost. She swallowed hard as her eyes widened, her true, panicked self resurfacing. </p><p>They were supposed to go to the hospital… they were supposed to be in a hospital surrounded by trained nurses. She was supposed to be by her wife’s side, letting her crush her hands as nurses delivered their son in a sterile hospital room with the right equipment. But no. They were here. They were in their home… in their kitchen… with the only training Rio had was online research and TikTok videos. And this… this was her fault, wasn’t it. Sex was a way to induce labor and at first her wife didn’t even want to be touched, and then she did. It was Rio’s fault… her fault… somehow she induced it… if that even made sense. Was it her fault? </p><p>“Please, my love,” her wife groaned above her, the pain in her voice was like a slap in the face. </p><p>She shook out of her spiral, finally able to breathe as she stood, running to their bathroom and grabbing towels as her wife wailed behind her, the moans of pains echoing off the walls and straight into her heart. She didn’t care as she knocked into stuff, pulling their bathroom closet apart as she grabbed the first few towels before running back to the kitchen. Her hands were surprisingly steady as she laid the towels underneath her wife, before rushing towards the sink, stepping over the broken glass as the water grew hot, scrubbing her hands and arms before rushing back to her wife, kneeling in front of her. </p><p>Agatha was trembling, her whole body straining, curling in on itself like a storm pulling into its own eye. Sweat was gathering in the dips of her collarbones, dripping down her breasts and around her stomach as her body started to crouch, sitting back against the wood of their kitchen island. Her eyes were wild, cracking with lightning behind them as they stared down at Rio whose heart was thundering over her own ragged breath. Her hands were damp, but clean as she placed a hand on the junction of her wife’s groin, keeping her legs open as fluids drenched the towel beneath her. Rio sat up on her knees, caressing her wife’s face with her free hand, placing a kiss to the corner of her mouth as blue eyes closed– her wife groaning low in pain before panting. </p><p>“I’m right here, <em> mi amor. </em>I’m here,” she spoke, her voice steadier than would have thought as she brushed the stray strands that stuck to Agatha’s face. “Just breathe like we practiced.”   </p><p>Her wife growled low, “Fuck you, you mother fucking cunt! I am– oh fuck!” </p><p>Agatha was swearing at her… good sign. </p><p>She kissed her again, a quick peck before staring down at the head. It was slick with birth, but the hair was there, full and thick. She couldn’t stop the small smile before taking her wife’s hand, easing her to relax for a moment. She led her hand down, feeling the curls that were there. </p><p>Her wife perked up, staring at her in wonder– but the wonder didn’t last as her wife groaned again, screaming as her hands shot out to grip Rio’s shoulders, clutching like a drowning woman. Agatha’s head flew back as Rio placed her hand on the baby’s head, trying to guide him– ready to catch when he would inevitably slip into their world. Her wife cried out again, her knees buckling but Rio caught her, steadying her, cushioning her the best she could with strong arms that weren’t trembling yet, and soft towels that now were ruined with sweat, blood, and everything that made this moment so terrifyingly real. </p><p>“It burns– Rio– my love,” her wife almost crashed her forehead with hers, Rio leaning back in time to stop the headbutt and Agatha cried out again. “I-I can’t– Rio– fuck you–”</p><p>Rio held back a smile, “You are, <em> cariño. </em>He’s right here. You’re doing it– almost there.” </p><p>The crown of black hair was slipping further forward now, Rio catching the sight of his little eyes all while checking to make sure he wasn’t turning blue. She felt her own blood thrumming through her body, barely noticing the way her knees bruised and ached as she knelt on the hard floors, keeping fresh towels an arm’s length away. </p><p>“Push when your body says to, <em> mi amor. </em>” </p><p>Agatha nodded weakly, breathing out hard once before sucking in a breath. And then, she bore down– the kind of push that came from somewhere ancient, somewhere maternal. A scream tore from Agatha’s throat, primal, bloody, and raw, shaking Rio’s very bones and the foundations of the house. Plants curled back as Scratchy thumped anxiously in the background. Her body bowed, staining and contracting as her nails cut into Rio’s shoulders, possibly drawing blood. And for a breath, the world froze, the air thickened as Rio… Rio watched before her very eyes… her and her wife becoming mothers. </p><p>The baby slipped, the umbilical cord attached but not tangled. He was bright pink, wet, and… she blinked… her hands full of him, slippery and small… warm.  She reached for a clean towel, clearing his mouth and nose, and the moment she did, a cry echoed… silencing everything around them. </p><p>Impossible tiny limbs flailed as he continued to cry a bright, but almost angry sound– his eyes wrinkled shut, and his face covered in the slime of birth. Rio blinked again, staring at him. </p><p>Their son. </p><p>Their son. </p><p>He was finally here and all Rio could hear was music, despite how loud he was for such a tiny body. And in that moment, sitting in the kitchen at three o’clock in the morning, Rio’s life felt truly forever changed. Instead of some wayward melody, she heard a symphony. </p><p>Rio was sobbing before she even knew it, the sound mixed between a laugh and gasp as she kissed her son’s downy head before placing him in her wife’s outstretched arms. </p><p>Her wife laughed weakly, cooing at him breathlessly and chuckling tearfully, “Oh, hi.” </p><p>Agatha was quick to take him, holding him close to her bare chest– skin to skin, subsiding their son’s cries. Rio moved, replacing the soaked towel with a new one before easing her wife to settle down, her back against the cabinets. She grabbed another towel, whipping her wife’s legs clean before snapping her head up when she heard his first coo. </p><p>Their eyes locked, a light, melodic silence settling between as she watched her wife and newborn son. Hands cradled his tiny feet, barely filling the palm of her wife’s hand. His head was resting against her breast nuzzling into her warmth as tiny hands reached out, one grabbing onto pale skin– the other, wrapping tightly around a chestnut lock of his mother. </p><p>“Congratulations, my love,” Rio murmured, cleaning her hands before cupping her wife’s cheek. “He’s here. Our son.”</p><p>Her wife sighed, her eyes closing as she pressed her face against her hand, weakly kissing her wrist. Rio couldn’t stop the smile as she pressed forward, capturing her wife’s lips tenderly as Nicholas continued to gurgle and coo on her chest. She pressed a kiss to his head again, everything within her sobbing as he pressed closer into his mama. </p><p>“Let me grab more clean towels and call the hospital, <em> cariño,” </em>she murmured against her lips, pressing another kiss before hurrying off. </p><p>They weren’t done. Agatha still had to deliver placenta and the paramedics could take her. She grabbed a couple more towels before finding a phone on their nightstand. Before she could open the emergency part, a low groan made her run back to her wife. </p><p>“Rio– what’s–” her wife’s eyes were wide again, panic creeping around her irises as she pulled Nicholas to her chest.</p><p>She knelt down, holding her wife’s legs open, “Just the placenta, <em> mi amor. </em>”</p><p>The placenta came easy, the cord still attached as she wrapped the thing in a towel. The phone was ringing then, 9-1-1 answering as her wife never left her gaze from their son who breathed evenly against her chest, his ear kept close to the only thing he has ever known in his life : Agatha’s heart. </p><p>“Yes, he’s fine, still attached and placenta is out,” Rio spoke quietly into the phone. </p><p>The operator crackled in the silent room, the keys clicking like teeth on the speaker. Then his voice returned, calm and maddeningly steady. </p><p>“Okay, Rio, two ambulances are en route from the hospital. How’s mom doing?” </p><p>She smiled, ready to see those gentle, river blues. She pulled away from the tiny rise and fall of Nicholas’s back to her wife, but something was wrong. Agatha’s eyes were hollow, distant, dim of life. Her body had started trembling and her teeth weren’t exactly chattering, just trembling in place. Her head dipped, listing sideways as if her neck had lost the strength to hold it up.</p><p>Rio bolted upright, “<em> Mi amor </em>?” </p><p>She pressed her hand to her wife’s cheek. </p><p>Cold. <em> Too cold </em>. </p><p>She tapped. </p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>Slapped, gently. </p><p>No answer. </p><p>The body beneath her sagged, boneless.</p><p>“Agatha?!”</p><p>Then came the warmth– something unnatural, wet, sticky… <em> wrong. </em> It crept to her thighs, seeping into her sweatpants, slow and merciless, like tea leaves soaking in water. She didn’t want to look because <em> she knew– </em>her whole body knew. But her eyes fell anyway, watching her world turn red as she reached for their son, holding him to her chest as if his tiny breaths alone could regulate hers in the horror movie she stepped into. The towel beneath her wife was soaked through, just a mere base of a puddle as their hardwood tried to take the rest. The red pool was thick, glistening under their kitchen lights, spreading with a horrible calm, and it didn’t stop. </p><p>Rio gasped, clutching Nicholas to her chest with one hand, the other on her wife’s cheek. Her own heart pounded so hard it felt like it might shatter her sternum, her soul begging to be released to reach her wife. </p><p>“Agatha,” she croaked on sobs that rose high into the head winds. “Agatha!” </p><p>Louder and desperate. </p><p>“Agatha– ¡<em> No, mi amor! Por favor–”  </em></p><p>The phone on the floor lit up, a distant voice yelling at her, mixing in the symphony of her own son’s wails– as if he knew <em> too </em>the grief that was before them. Rio was choking. Her eyes wide and unblinking– jaw clattering as if that alone could stop the crimson pool inching around her.  </p><p>Then, her lungs stopped working and something else took over as she shook her wife, trying to wake her up. All the while, Rio watched on in a third person point of view– out her body– watching her life crumble around her as sirens completed the symphony– and paramedics pulling Agatha away before her family could even sing.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<b>Rio </b>
</p><p>“Agatha!” Rio stormed into the hospital, clutching her wailing son to her chest as her eyes squinted against bright fluorescents. “Where is she? Agatha!” </p><p> </p><p>The ambulance was a blur before that, a mess of lights and too many strangers in her home. She had frozen, her mind going blank, and the only thing she was able to do was soothe the newborn in her arms as her wife was placed on a stretcher and ran out of their house before she could follow. The ambulance left, leaving her standing in the night, the leftover paramedics grabbing her bags and locking up her house before she even knew she was being led into the back of another ambulance. The medics there worked around her, her son fighting in her arms as they maneuvered him, severing him from the last tether to his other mother before wrapping him in a plain white baby blanket. Rio clung to him, her tears pouring down her cheeks as she faintly heard the medic beside her, trying to calm her, trying to coax her as they took her blood pleasure- which she was sure with how high it must be– she should be dead… but if Agatha…</p><p> </p><p>Before she could take another step, nurses were surrounding her, and it took everything in her not to jerk her body back feeling a hand on her arm. The infant in her arms was squealing, impossibly tiny fingers clutching into her skin, the other hand latched to her hair, refusing to let go. She couldn’t let him go– she couldn’t– everything in her body was shaking, working twice as hard as her very blood– it felt as if her veins were swelling, ready to pop as the light hurt her head. </p><p>“Rio– Mrs. Harkness-Vidal– please,” a nurse’s voice finally broke through the film. </p><p>She stepped towards the nurse, knowing how wild she must look, covered in blood, her hair in tangles, clutching a newborn, “Where is she? Where is my wife?” </p><p>“Doctors have her– she lost a good bit of blood, and they’re doing transfusions now.” </p><p>Rio shook her head, this time slowly yanking her arms away from a nurse making grabbing hands at her son, “I have to be with her–”</p><p>“Mrs. Harkness–” </p><p>She didn’t let her finish, her voice frantic, her eyes pleading with the shorter nurse to understand, “No– no way! You don’t understand. She can’t be alone when she wakes up.”</p><p>“I assure you ; we will have doctors present–”</p><p>Rio’s eyes grew wide, her heart ready to jump from her throat and run through the damn hospital itself to get to her wife. Her wife couldn’t be by herself, couldn’t wake up alone– and each thought of her waking to no one, sent Rio into a spiral. </p><p>“No, she’s scared– scared of hospitals– please, don’t let her wake up without me there!”</p><p>The nurse faltered, just for a moment, as if something in Rio’s voice– hoarse and breaking, so raw it didn’t even sound like pleading, just truth– was sharp enough to fray through the clinical cool of protocol. The baby cried harder, his voice small but unyielding, the same as his mother’s resolve.</p><p>“We will see what we can do, but please– let us take a look at him.” </p><p>Rio felt the protest on the tip of her tongue until another nurse was in front of her, her eyes gentle, a simple tilt of her head, “You can come with us. The doctor just needs to check a few things, his lungs–” </p><p>At that, her son screamed harder, his mouth rooting against her upper chest, making some of the nurses smile.</p><p>“His lungs do sound strong,” another nurse cooed. </p><p>The younger nurse, blonde and spirited, smiled up at Rio, “Then we will check his heart, see how much love you and your wife put into it. Doc will also redo his vitals and measurements.”</p><p>An older nurse stepped forward as Rio’s protectiveness cracked, “Please, dear, will you let us? It’s important for his survival too.” </p><p>With that, she nodded, allowing the blonde to step forward and cradle him into her arms with practiced ease before two others were there, chuckling under their breaths as they unwrapped his tiny fingers from her hair.</p><p>Rio was alert as she followed them, her eyes wide but pinned on her son who continued to cry. She followed close on their heels, stalking behind in the shadows like a mountain lion, her heart pounding a ragged rhythm behind her ribs. Every time he wailed, it tore something deeper into her. It felt wrong, her skin itching from the absence of him– of her– and he had only just arrived in the world, still caught in the first echo of cries while his mother had been ripped away from her with no warning, no goodbye, just an orchestra of blood and flashing lights. </p><p>The hallway opened into a quieter wing– soft beeps, warm-toned walls, the kind of hush and sterile reserved for new beginnings. The nurse guiding them slowed, opening a door to a smaller room full of supplies and machines Rio did not have a name for. It smelled of clean linen and something gentler– something like a fresh meadow on a warm spring day… something to calm a newborn, and her own newborn was placed into a tall bassinet before the nurses cleared out, trading places with a doctor who swept in with patience and a tired grace Rio had recognized from her own self. </p><p>“My, he looks amazing for a sudden home birth and those lungs,” she chuckled softly, deep red hair pinned up in a bun, before she turned with a gentle smile on Rio. </p><p>She was older, but the lines were light that carved her face, her eyes a dark blue, that radiant peace, “Hello, I’m Dr. Aubrey Montgomery. You must be Rio– his mother and a very worried wife.” </p><p>Rio would crack a smile, but she couldn’t as her eyes narrowed behind the doctor to her son. Instead, she nodded in greeting– Montgomery turning back to Nicholas. </p><p>“You did a wonderful job, Rio, for the delivery. Did you train or study somewhere?”</p><p>She cleared her throat, finding it hoarse and responded slowly, “No– uh, just read a lot on the internet and some books.”</p><p>Montgomery didn’t look at her as she smiled, “Well, Rio, you delivered a healthy baby boy– his vitals look great, lungs clear, and his heart is strong. Let’s get his measurements– does he have a name yet?” </p><p>She smiled softly, her mind drifting to the day lilies, “Nicholas, Nicholas Scratch… Harkness-Vidal.”</p><p>“Nicholas,” she hummed, smiling at the babe as he wailed even louder. “You are an even nine pounds and five ounces, and twenty-one inches, mister.” </p><p>Rio’s mind was running though, through the blood, through the way her wife just went unresponsive, and her fists curled. She replayed everything, as if her life was recorded on a screen, watching her wife through their dinner, dancing together after doing dishes, and sex… Gods… </p><p>“Is it my fault?” she blurted before she could stop herself. </p><p>This time Montgomery blinked up at her and for a moment, they only listened to Nicholas’s whimpers as he was passed back into her arms. The doctor didn’t smile, didn’t react– her gaze unnervingly steady, making Rio want to grab her by the neck and shake the bitch. </p><p>“No, it’s not your fault. Hemorrhages happen, even with professionals on staff. They’re working on her now and doing everything they can.” </p><p>Rio sat up, holding her son to her chest, “And what if–” </p><p>The door opened, interrupting her as the older nurse was back with a bottle, “Alright, let’s get him fed. You want to feed him, dear?” </p><p>The world stopped, just a second– a second that felt like hours as her gaze turned down to the baby in her arms. <em> Gods </em>, he was gorgeous– he was still pink, but the goo and the birth were wiped away, those fragile wrinkles, and alienated looks gone… just a baby– one clinging to her tightly, nuzzling into her with trusting whimpers. Her son… their son… and a different dam broke through Rio’s walls. Tears ran down her face as her son wiggled, trying to bring himself closer to her, almost as if he was already done with the outside world and wanted to be cradled back inside. </p><p>Rio didn’t notice the doctor leaving, just the nurse kneeling in front of her, murmuring directions, steady hands guiding him on his back in her arm, one wrinkling one cupping under his head and neck until it was placed perfectly against her breast. The white blanket held him but didn’t stop his hands from reaching for her. Rio looked up, locking gazes with the old nurse who smiled at her, holding a tiny bottle for her– it was only two ounces, the amount newborns drink within the first hour of life. She held the bottle up, bringing the nipple to his tiny mouth, and he took it quickly. His cries ceased entirely and a soft suckling filled the room. Then, a hand found her again, not pulling, just holding as once more the world stopped.</p><p>Her heart was fluttering, her body flying as she fed the tiny body made of both her wife and her. Her eyes raked over his face, already seeing both of them. His chin was Agatha’s already, a small dimple that would grow– his hair also her wife’s, but the color was an even shade between them : darker than chestnut, but lighter than her raven hair. And then, his eyes opened, and Rio felt her heart skip a beat, more tears running down her face as rich brown eyes stared up at her, <em> really </em>stared up at her. </p><p>Oh. </p><p>
<em> Oh.  </em>
</p><p>It was <em> her </em>. </p><p>Rio was staring down a mini version of herself. </p><p>The hand in her hair moved up, reaching for her face and next thing Rio knew, her head was already bowing, bringing it closer until five tiny fingers, no longer than an inchworm, were against her chin. </p><p>They didn’t grip, just rested there, feeling and exploring his world– so curious already. She closed her eyes, pressing a kiss to his hand and the tears kept falling. She didn’t bother to wipe, just allowed herself to feel everything– feel the pride deep in her chest, the love that was already so strong it made her body hurt, the worry for her wife that felt like oxygen had depleted. She didn’t notice the nurse walk out either– silent as a breath from a candle. The room was only filled with the steady suckling of milk and a few tiny hums from Nicholas, blissful in his mother’s arms. She cradled him closer, her cheek brushing those curls, before inhaling– a mix of milk, a tiny bit of hospital, and something distinctly him and Agatha. </p><p>Nicholas stared up at her, mouth still greedily working the bottle, but slower, drowsy, and trusting– and it was that trust that broke her and rebuilt her all in one breath. And suddenly, she couldn’t stop talking. Her voice came in low, thick with emotion, words trembling but tumbling free softer than an owl learning to sing through the night. </p><p>“<em> Ay mijito, tu mamá va a estar tan feliz– o bueno, va a fingir estar molesta conmigo, con estos grandes ojitos marrones, pero te enseñaré algo,” </em>she whispered when his mouth opened, allowing her to set the now empty bottle aside, his eyes fluttering. (Oh, my little son, your mama is gonna be so happy– well, she’s gonna feign being mad at me, with these big brown eyes, but I’ll teach you something.)</p><p><em> “Primero, mamá siempre está a cargo. ¿Quieres algo? Tendrás que preguntarle. Si me preguntas te voy a mandar con tu mamá a menos que podamos esconderlo de ella. Pero el secreto, mijito, es que tienes que usar esos ojos marrones– mi regalo para tí. Son su debilidad y juntos podemos hacer que se desmorone– pero ella te enseñará mejor como manipular– como defenderte, como dominar el mundo con solo una mirada– te enseñará a cantar, a leer, a escribir– te enseñará nuestra canción </em>.” (First thing, Mama is always in charge. You want something? You must ask her. Ask me and I will send you to your mama unless we can hide it from her. But the secret, my little son, is that you have to use these big brown eyes– my gift to you. They are her weakness and together, we can make her crumble– but she will teach you how to manipulate the best– how to stand strong for yourself, how to dissect the world with a single glance– she’ll teach you to sing, to read, to write– teach you our song.)</p><p>And it seemed, at the mention of his mama, his face scrunched up, his breath sucking in before he let out a few soft, cranky cries. Rio brought him up to her chest, settling his ear against her heartbeat as she kissed his head, taking in his scent. </p><p>“<em> Ow, yo sé, conejito, </em> ” she soothed, her body on autopilot as she stood, swaying herself. “ <em> Tengo otro secreto para tí– uno que no le puedes contar a mamá. En una de nuestras primeras citas me sentó a ver mi primer musical– </em> The Sound of Music <em> y la manera en la que su cara se encendió– sus ojos azules brillan cuando se emociona– cuando la película empezó, escuché cantar a tu mamá. No le digas pero es lo único que me gusta de los musicales. Su voz es celestial mijito, mejor que la mía, y yo sé que te cantará nuestra canción cada noche antes de dormir, así que, por ahora, te cantaré una canción distinta. Ella merece ser la primera en cantar nuestra canción. </em> ” (Oh, I know, conejito. I have another secret to tell you– one you can never tell Mama. It was one of our first couple dates and she sat me down for my first musical– <em> The Sound of Music </em>and the way Mama’s face lit up– her blue eyes get this extra shine when she is excited– when the movie started, I listened to your mama sing. Don’t tell her, but that’s the only part I like about musicals. Her voice is heavenly, my son, so much better than mine, and I know she will sing you our song every night before bed, so for now, I will sing you a different song. She deserves to be the first one to sing you our song.) </p><p> </p><p align="center"><em> “ </em> <em> Edelweiss, edelweiss  </em></p><p align="center">

</p><p> </p><p>He had slept peacefully in her arms as she swayed around the room, trying not to pace as her focus was on him– it had to be on him, or she would break. Eventually, the nurse came back another following with her bags from the ambulance and it was only then that Rio realized she was still in her blood-soaked sweatpants, whatever was on her shirt, and her bare feet frozen against the concrete floor. After convincing her once again to let them take Nicholas, Rio was able to shower and change, luckily bringing her own slides and changing into a different pair of sweats and a crew neck from Salemite’s University.</p><p>The moment she stepped out, she rushed to where he was sleeping in a nurse’s arms, the same one who promised she wouldn’t leave the room. She didn’t, thank the gods, and with ease, Nicholas was back in her arms. She clung to him, pressing kisses to his head, humming every song but <em> their </em> song. Her wife deserved that– and something gnawed at Rio that her wife didn’t get the joys of being the first to feed their son. But she couldn’t change it and wouldn’t if it meant both him and her wife surviving– <em> if </em> she survived. </p><p>Another hour went on, and Nicholas was still happily against her chest, listening to her heartbeat. She was in the chair now, her eyes fighting to stay open, murmuring soft Spanish to her son when a knock jolted her upright, staring at the nurse. </p><p>“We are going to do another check on him and then bring you to Agatha. She’s stable, but we had to give her a dose of Ativan when she woke up–”</p><p>Rio’s head snapped up, her mouth parting, but for a moment no sound came. Her fingers curled around Nicky, shielding his body from her own raging storm inside her. </p><p>“When she woke up?” her voice cracked low with disbelief, then steadied like a storm brewing over the horizon. “You let her wake up alone? After everything I said?”</p><p>The nurse stumbled back for a moment, her professional façade fading for a moment.</p><p>“She was agitated, disoriented. We had to calm her down before she got violent–”</p><p>Rio rose slowly like a tidal wave, Nicky still held close. “I told you and every single person that she couldn’t wake up alone.” </p><p>She didn’t shout– she didn’t have to. She kept her voice colder than arctic winds, soundless at times, but holding the frozen bitten punch. A tone she only used in classrooms or board meetings. But this time, her eyes glistened, sharp and wet, as she could imagine the pure panic of Agatha’s face realizing Rio and Nicholas weren’t there. And gods, it was hard to breathe. </p><p>“She needed me, not a sedative,” she growled low, Nicky now fussing softly at her chest as though sensing her shift. </p><p>The nurse didn’t argue, just nodded slowly, “I understand. If I may do one last check on him before bringing you to her?” </p><p>Once again, she had to fight herself, handing him as she disappeared down the hall. Minutes felt like hours, the hand dragging itself until the nurse appeared with a few others. She was quick to return Nicky to her arms as the others grabbed her bags for her, the nurse leading them through long halls as Rio held the most precious thing in the world. Yet the world around them held its breath as the nurses kept a distance behind her until the doors opened to the postpartum unit. It was quiet, a few newborn cries making her son twitch against her. She caressed his cheek, soothing him as they made it to the end of the hall, the old nurse opening the door to a private suite. </p><p>Inside, the lights were dimmed only slightly, the blinds pulled to where the coming sun was blocked entry. The room was painted a soothing baby green, a bathroom to the side, and a cot just under the window. A rocking chair sat across from the cot, a basket of leaflets, baby bottles, blankets, and diapers resting in its seat. On the other side of the wall was a bassinet and an island full of more medical supplies, but in the center was a practical hospital bed and her wife, dressed in a pink gown, sleeping soundly against the pillows. Her cheek was turned to the side, facing the window as she laid there half sitting up. Her arms were limp next to her, an IV stuck in one, a bag beside her dripping with fluid. But the color was back in those high cheekbones, her hair a mess behind her, tied loosely in a tail– probably by a nurse. </p><p>She jumped when a hand landed on her shoulder, the old nurse coming beside her and whispering, “When she wakes, she’s alright to start breastfeeding him. There’s a pamphlet in the basket or you can grab one of us if you need help.”</p><p>And with that, her bags were set on the cot and the door shut behind her with a deafening click. Yet, Rio couldn’t move– she was rooted to her spot, staring at the strongest woman she ever knew, the love of her life– the woman who now seemed so small with a nasal cannula to help her breathe. But the relief had more tears streaming down her face– her love was alive ; she was here for her and their son.</p><p>Just like that, those blue eyes began fluttering open, flinching at the light before a pained whimper left Agatha’s throat. Rio was by her side before her brain caught up, her body moving, a hand caressing her cheek just under the oxygen tubes. Her wife relaxed into it, pressing against the hand as her eyes remained closed for a moment longer. </p><p>“Oh, <em> mi amor, </em> you’re alright,” Rio couldn’t stop herself from whispering, her heart practically cracking when blue eyes became alert– panicked as a hand wrapped tightly around her wrist– but the hand was shaking. “Shhh, <em> está bien </em> , <em> mi amor. </em>It’s me, sweetheart.” </p><p>Agatha visibly relaxed, blinking now before turning her head away, another pained sound leaving her throat. Rio leaned over, peppering her cheeks and head with kisses until her wife relaxed, turning back to her to meet her lips. Warmth spread through Rio as a thumb was on her cheek, wiping away her tears, but instead she felt more on her cheeks, her wife’s mixing with hers. </p><p>“Where is he?” her wife asked the moment they pulled away. </p><p>She smiled, really smiled as stood up straight, helping her wife unsnap her gown as she spoke, “He’s right here– we’ve been waiting, but I think he’s been more anxious than I have been.”</p><p>Her wife stayed quiet, her arms staying at her sides as Rio unwrapped him from his blanket, causing a soft cry to echo into the room before placing him on her wife’s chest, skin to skin– and instantly, he quieted, nuzzling into the crest of Agatha’s breast as more tears ran down her wife’s face. Rio was quick to wipe them away, watching her wife slip into motherhood, a hand on his back, the other softly running through his curls. </p><p>“You my dear Nicholas– you were made from scratch,” her wife whispered, pressing a soft kiss to his downy hair before looking up at Rio with blues brighter than Rio had ever seen.</p><p>She didn’t waste another second, leaning down and kissing her wife, a hand back on her cheek as their lips met, setting her heart ablaze with something she couldn’t even name. She loved Agatha– had known that since the day Agatha knocked on her door at three am telling her that they were girlfriends. One of the best days of Rio’s life… one of them, because after that was when Agatha told her yes in their rotten apartment during their PhDs. Then, it was their wedding day, then it was when Agatha told her she wanted to have a kid, and after that was when her wife first was pregnant… and now it was this… her wife’s lips against her, their tears mixing together, and their son, clinging to Agatha’s chest– both of them alive, strong, and whom she was so deeply in love with. </p><p>Agatha gasped, pulling away– and for a split second, Rio thought she hurt her. Instead, they both looked down, seeing Nicholas was moving, clumsily on her chest, his mouth working against her– searching, rooting. Rio’s heart fluttered as she kissed her wife’s head before guiding Agatha’s arms around him. Her wife’s breath trembling as Rio murmured soft instructions, helping her cradle their son. Rio could tell her wife was still weak, her movements slow, not just in care, but in pure exhaustion. But Rio was prepared– ready to hold all three of them for the rest of her life and yet, instinct was also a powerful thing… so was love. Through the fog of exhaustion, through the weight of pain, and so many tears shed, Agatha’s arms held their son like she had done it a thousand times before. </p><p>“That’s it, <em> mi amor. </em>Now, let him find you,” she whispered, brushing her lips against the corner of her wife’s.</p><p>They both watched as Nicholas, still with his eyes closed, mouth open and closed against her breast, whining softly, and grunting sleepily. He moved again– his mouth catching the edge of her nipple but failing and letting out another whine. Rio lifted her wife’s arms a little more, tilting him better before he tried again. Agatha inhaled sharply at the first latch, her body becoming rigid before relaxing as their baby began to nurse for the first time from her. It was awkward, a little messy as it leaked from the corner of his mouth for a moment before mother and son settled. A tiny hand reached up, finding her wife’s hair, holding it as he did to Rio. </p><p>Tears streamed down her cheeks, pooling against the tubes before spilling over them as soft suckles filled the room, more eager than the first time as he hummed in pure content before brown eyes opened, staring directly into Agatha’s eyes and never leaving. Her wife laughed, quietly, weakly, choking on her emotions as both of them could only stare in wonder. Agatha lifted her hand, a finger just feathering over his cheek and they both watched as his eyes fluttered at the feeling before going back to sucking with a sharp demand. </p><p>“Gods, he already looks so much like you,” her wife murmured more to herself than to Rio.</p><p>But Rio saw it even more now– the way Nicholas’ skin was just a few shades darker than the pale fragile skin of her wife– the way he melted like she did when Agatha caressed their cheeks– and fuck, he was just hours old and already knew the meaning of that gesture… how full of love that gesture was from his mama without even seeing it for himself. </p><p>“You won both bets,” her wife then broke the silence, a glare being casted her way. </p><p>Rio forced herself to flinch– even though now, there was no strength behind it– at least to give her wife the dignity of it. She shuffled up shyly, making herself seem smaller, because if her wife was strong enough in this moment, she would have earned a fair tongue lashing. </p><p>“And if I tell you that I want to change that last prize?” she asked more than stated, sitting on the edge of the bed as Nicky continued to suckle.</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, her face tilting as if to say, <em> Go on, dig yourself deep.  </em></p><p>Rio tucked some of her hair away from her wife’s face, mindful of the strand of hair Nicky kept in his fist, “What I want is that you allow me to take care of you and our son for the next six weeks without hearing complaints from you, <em> mi amor. </em>You’ll allow me to serve you breakfast in bed, allow yourself to sleep whenever and wherever, eat when I tell you to, and allow me to get up with you when it comes to feeding him.” </p><p>She scoffed, rolling her eyes, before letting a harsh huff that almost disturbed the baby latched to her breast, “I hate you.”</p><p>“I missed you,” the words slipped from her mouth faster than she could stop them. </p><p>That both froze at that, Rio wanting to set fire to her own tears as they came– holding images of Agatha bleeding out on their kitchen floor– to the puddle of blood she knelt in that was there in a blink of an eye, to Rio frantically yelling in the lobby, the nurses coddling her like she was the same age as Nicky– to Rio holding on to their son– distracting herself with him so didn’t have to think about never being able to kiss her wife again. </p><p>“Rio–” </p><p>
<em> Knock. Knock.  </em>
</p><p>Both of their heads lifted at that, Rio wiping her tears and forcing a more professional façade on her face as the dumbass doctor doesn’t even wait for them to give the go ahead. She swooped in, a blonde girl bouncing in with the energy of Arizona Robbins but on steroids. Rio felt her wife bristle, holding Nicky closer who refused to pull away from his mama. </p><p>“How are we feeling, Mrs. Harkness?”</p><p>Her wife curled her lip, “Vidal, it’s Harkness-Vidal.”</p><p>The doctor seemed to wave her off, “Of course– well, your vitals look great, baby is doing wonderful–”</p><p>Rio stood from the bed, “She’s going to be fine?” </p><p>The doctor looked down, writing on her chart, “We’re unsure how much blood loss happened before you arrived to the hospital but while you were here you lost seven hundred and fifty milliliters. The blood loss could be upwards of two liters so we’re keeping you for a couple days– but we will see with tomorrow morning’s labs. You’re free to start eating solids when you are ready as well, Mrs. Harkness-Vidal.” </p><p>The doctor approached the infusion stand, looking over the tubes before staring down at Nicholas, her smile growing brighter, “He has a good latch. Just, if you fall asleep, the baby goes in mom’s arms or in the crib. When you need to use the bathroom, call the nurses, they’ll help you, okay? Any questions?”</p><p>Agatha refused to look at her, her eyes already slowly blinking, but never leaving their son who was drifting off right along with her. He still suckled, his eyes staring straight up at her with pure trust– pure adoration– his whole world holding him safely. Rio cleared her throat, getting the doctor to look up at her. </p><p>“When do you suggest visitors? We have a rabbit at home and the kitchen is still covered in blood,” she murmured quietly, scared of her wife overhearing. </p><p>The doctor nodded, “Stay with your wife for today. And then tomorrow, visiting hours are nine hours to twelve and then sixteen hours to twenty-one. We only allow up to three visitors with a baby.” </p><p>Rio thanked her, waiting until the door closed again before turning back to her wife who was weakly moving Nicky, placing him on the center of her chest and moving the night gown to cover her breasts. She was beside her in two strides, a hand caressing the back of his head before the hand moved to cup her wife’s cheek. Their lips met softly, noses brushing– soothing her pounding heart like a balm. Her wife was okay– their son even more so who kept warm from both the blanket and Agatha’s chest. </p><p>“Lay with me,” Agatha whispered against her lips when they pulled away.</p><p>Her eyebrows raised as she caressed her cheek, hesitation filtering through her, “I don’t want to jostle you, <em> mi amor. </em>And–”</p><p>“Rio, my pussy fucking hurts. I’m pretty sure they just fisted into my cervix and then some to stop the bleeding so if you don’t fucking hold me right now— I’m gonna shove my fucking foot so far up your ass, that your son will be asking why you walk with a limp when he’s old enough to speak,” her wife snarled, startling her into stillness.</p><p>Then Rio let a long low chuckle, shaking her head as her eyes closed in aspiration.</p><p>Oh, her wife was going to be just fine. </p><p>“Easy, my love,” she chided as she squeezed beside her wife, sitting up more so her wife could adjust her head on her chest. “We have tiny ears present.” </p><p>Agatha shifted, angling her body into a more comfortable position without moving the baby on her chest, “Yeah, well, he’s not my son unless he’s swearing like a sailor at age four.” </p><p>And Rio had no doubt that will be their son in four years. </p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio had waited until her wife fell asleep before moving, gathering Nicholas into her arms and setting him in the crib just as the nurse came in. Nicky was checked on before the nurse quietly showed Rio how to swaddle him in the blanket her wife had made. On his wrist came the hospital band : </p><p>
<strong>Harkness-Vidal, Nicholas S.</strong>
</p><p><strong>DOB</strong>: <strong>05/17/2035</strong></p><p> </p><p>They didn’t get to sleep long though. In three hours, a nurse was there, shaking Rio to wake her wife and their son for him to feed. And it was then they set into a routine, Agatha sleeping right with her son, leaving Rio to either sleep with her or watch over both of them. </p><p>Not even twenty-four hours old and Nicky was already their whole world. </p><p> </p><p>It was around three in the afternoon when Rio ordered the sushi platter for her wife and ordered fried rice for herself. Her wife had lit up the moment Rio placed the wooden platter across her lap, filled with all her favorite sushi, mainly nigiri, onigiri, and maki rolls. None of them with avocado as her wife hated the texture. Agatha had eaten with Nicky still feeding from her, her smile bright as she had spoken to him in between bites. Rio sat on the edge of the bed, eating her own rice as she watched her wife and son only with pure adoration. </p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t until late at night when Rio was back to holding her wife after she cried from a mix of pain, emotion, and exhaustion, did Agatha talk of what happened. </p><p> </p><p>Hands glided through thick hair, gently tugging out knots as Rio sat up on the bed, holding her wife to her chest as she finally quieted from her cries. Rio didn’t speak though, knowing that this was a different time of pain– of exhaustion. Agatha’s body shook, but nonetheless pressed against her with need, feeling soothed by the simple gestures of hands through her hair. To the right, Nicholas slept, re-swaddled in the green blanket, his little breaths, making the wool rise and fall carefully. </p><p>“Rio, my love,” Agatha croaked, making her body jump, her heart stuttering in surprise as she looked down, her own hand going to cradle her wife’s jaw.</p><p><em> “Cariño, </em>” she cooed softly, her thumb stroking against the bone. </p><p>Agatha fisted her shirt, hiding her face, and as a hot breath whispered against her chest, “Thank you.”</p><p>She remained, quiet for a moment, letting it all sink in as her thumb never stopped along her jaw. She breathed in steadily, licking at her tears on her cheeks before kissing her head. </p><p>“<em> Siempre </em> , <em> mi amor, y para siempre. </em> ” <em>   </em></p><p> </p><p>A loud snort startled her, Rio looking down in shock as her wife laughed, snorting as she buried her face further into Rio. She didn’t know how to react, frozen with her wife atop of her– one moment collapsed in her arms, the next laughing hysterically. </p><p>“Agatha?” she tried gently, but panic had laced its way in. “Agatha, do I need to call the nurse? <em> ¿Qué coño? </em>” </p><p>Her wife shook her head, still snorting softly, “We fucking had him in the kitchen.”</p><p>She cracked a weak smile, shaking her head as her wife continued to uncontrollably laugh against her.</p><p>“At least it wasn’t the highway,” Rio murmured, looking over to him. </p><p>Her wife only laughed louder at that, Nicky squirming at the sound before going still. </p><p>Agatha looked up at her, face blotchy and red, but her wife was still fucking glowing. Blues sparkled, her lips in that smile that had been permanent since the moment Agatha saw Rio holding Nicholas. Lips pressed to her before her wife was laughing again. </p><p>“Mm, imagine him being a teenager, giving us attitude, standing in that kitchen, and you get to tell him that you pulled him out of my vagina right where he is standing,” Agatha snorted, and this time Rio couldn’t hold back her own laughter.</p><p>She pulled her wife against her, mindful of her stomach as she nuzzled into the top of her head, “Speaking of that kitchen, I should go clean it tomorrow before it starts to smell too bad. Plus, Scratchy shouldn’t be alone tomorrow.”</p><p>Her wife quieted at that, her gaze on their son before clinging to her again. She didn’t have to speak, Rio already knew. </p><p>“I was thinking of calling Lilia– she is the only one who won’t snitch to the rest of the coven. She can come so you’re not alone and then take Señor Scratchy to watch until you both are discharged. I’ll come back with food, Nando’s, or leftovers, or if you want more sushi. Whatever my queen wants to feed our little prince.” </p><p>Rio was hit for the last sentence, “Gross, don’t get sappy on me, Vidal.” </p><p>She merely chuckled, “You love it.” </p><p>Her wife shook her head, “I <em> love </em> you.”  </p><p> </p><p>When Agatha fell asleep, and Nicky not due to wake for another three hours, Rio stepped out into the lobby, calling Lilia. </p><p>“Rio? Did something happen? You never call,” worry laced her voice the moment the phone dialed once. </p><p>She smiled faintly, though her lips trembled under the weight of the day’s unravelling. The hallway light buzzed above her, nurses passing with quiet footsteps as she leaned back against the drywall, hand gripping tight on the phone. </p><p>“Yeah,” she released her breath. “<em> He’s here. </em>” </p><p>Unlike what Oriana would do, Lilia didn’t screech with excitement. Her breath came out steady, a small breeze to ground them both in the moment before her wife’s best friend spoke. </p><p>“When?” she asked quietly.</p><p>“This morning? Sometime around three? I don’t know,” she started rambling. “All I knew, I woke up and she was in the kitchen. I just acted.”</p><p>There was a long pause on the other end of the phone. </p><p>“Are you saying <em> you </em>delivered him?” Lilia’s voice was soaked in shock. </p><p>“In the kitchen,” she replied, almost sheepishly, as if the absurdity of it couldn’t be believed despite just laughing about it. “Agatha just looked at me and I looked, and he was crowning– but…”</p><p>She trailed off, feeling the fathom sensation on her legs.</p><p>Lilia spoke carefully, as if she was speaking to a deer that would easily fright, “Rio? Did something happen?” </p><p>She nodded as if Lilia could see her, “Hemorrhage. She’s stable now– her and the baby are fast asleep in the room. I just need a favor.”</p><p>“Of course, anything,” Lilia didn’t miss a beat. </p><p>“I need you to come to the hospital tomorrow and sit with her while I go back home and clean up and grab her favorite food. And also, to give you Scratchy, if you can watch him.”   </p><p>Lilia hummed, “Yes, I can watch him. Anything else? Do you want me to bring anything? I can bring wine for us to celebrate.” </p><p>Rio chuckled, rubbing her eyes as exhaustion clung tight to her, “No, Agatha still can’t drink. But, also, tell no one yet. Please. Agatha needs quiet, peace, while she recovers and Nicky already hates everyone but his mothers.” </p><p>“Mm, he only likes you. Sounds like someone familiar.”</p><p>She breathed out, a sigh ghosting her lips, “Gods, he’s going to be just like her, but wait till you see him.” </p><p>“Send a picture?” the music professor asked. </p><p>“No pictures,” she said a little too quickly, before softening. “Not yet. Can’t have Oriana bursting through the room until we are home and they are safe.” </p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<b>Lilia </b>
</p><p> </p><p>If you ever asked Lilia if she thought her childhood best friend would ever become a mother, she would have laughed until the stars fell from the sky. And then, she watched one of the greatest love stories ever told before her eyes. And this time it was real and raw. Her heart had tightened when Rio mentioned that she was the one who delivered their son in their kitchen and then stopped upon the word ‘<em> hemorrhage’.  </em></p><p>Agatha hated hospitals, always had, even if Lilia would eventually get there after Evanora left her to fend for herself, surrounded by machines and unknown doctors who were too cold with their medical professionalism and yet, with all that professionalism, they missed a girl being abused by her own mother <em> multiple </em>times. Both Lilia and Agatha had hated– and Agatha more scared of– doctors since. So, it wasn’t a surprise that Agatha most likely pushed through her contractions, ignoring them until the very last second. And Rio, wife of the year, fucking spouse of the decade, didn’t flinch, just acted to help her wife and son. And instead of leaving Agatha to deal with the mess at home, Rio– who trusted no one with the love of her life– asked Lilia to come in… Lilia was honored more than words could express. </p><p>Rio asked her to bring nothing, but what kind of best friend would she be if she did? She stayed up late, baking Agatha’s favorite snickerdoodle cookies and yes, gingerbread cookies. She cut out the shapes for them in rabbits, decorated them to look like Señor Scratchy before writing Nicholas’ name in icing of purple and green along the backs of the bunnies. It only took her four hours– and Snickerdoodles were easy. She went to bed at two in the morning, woke up at eight and was at the hospital by nine am sharp. But before that, she wrapped them all in a basket, figuring the nurses could also eat them as an apology for dealing with the Harkness-Vidals. She half wondered if she could turn into a fly on the wall to listen to their gossip. But laying on top of the cookies was a gift for both Rio and Agatha, a set of wool pajama pants. She had them custom made– black and purple. The purple was lavender with rabbits all over them and for Rio, a black base with green vines and leaves all over them, forming the bones of her legs and because she knew how much Agatha loves Rio’s ass, two monstera leaves printed on the asscheeks. And the reason why she knew was because if Agatha was drunk, she was lovesick for Rio. If she was high, only Rio could talk Agatha into doing anything sensible like drinking water. If Agatha was crossed, Agatha would not shut up about Rio’s ass.  </p><p>Now, she stood before a desk, clutching the basket tightly. A nurse looked, heavy bags under her eyes as she narrowed to the basket with a sigh. </p><p>“Who are you here for?” she asked without an ounce of enthusiasm. </p><p>Lilia swallowed, “Agatha Harkness-Vidal, she should be in the postpartum wing.” </p><p>The nurse looked up, “Callie!”</p><p>Another stopped, stepping forward in bright pink scrubs and blonde hair pinned in the back, “Yeah?”</p><p>“She’s here to see ‘Copy&amp;paste’. Can you take her to their room?” </p><p>Lilia stared, her eyes widening at the name ‘Copy&amp;paste.’ The nurses just chuckled as the blonde motioned her to follow. She clung to the basket, looking around, flinching at the sound of another mother bringing a baby into the world. Yet, she couldn’t help but ask the nurse as they turned down a quieter corridor. </p><p>“What do you mean ‘copy&amp;paste’?” she said quietly.</p><p>Callie didn’t slow down, but Lilia saw the smirk on her lips, “They didn’t send you a picture? I won’t lie, most babies are not cute when they are born, sometimes getting a little squished on the way out, but this baby– adorable, and yet, it seems his mothers must have copy-pasted him from the mom who <em> didn’t </em> birth him.” </p><p>Lilia stumbled a little, her foot caught as she muffled her own laugh, “You’re saying he looks like Rio? Already?”</p><p>“Yep,” the nurse nodded, popping the ‘P’ at the end. “Just wait till you see her holding him. Can barely tell the difference except slightly lighter hair.” </p><p>They stopped at a wooden door and there on a whiteboard was : </p><p>
<em> Harkness-Vidal  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Agatha and Nicholas  </em>
</p><p>“We will be in soon. If Copy&amp;paste is cluster feeding, he should be feeding right now.”</p><p>Lilia waited until the nurse walked away before knocking lightly. There was a moment of hush before the door creaked open and before her stood Rio, her hair held back in a claw clip, and brown tired eyes staring down at her, but nonetheless sparkling with happiness. She wore a green sweatshirt, green matching shorts, and comfortable slides as her smile was as bright as the one she wore on her wedding day. </p><p>“Lilia,” she smiled, stepping back and allowing her into the room. </p><p>It was quiet, only the sound was of music on very low in the background and soft suckling filling the room. She looked up and for a second, all she could do was stare. Agatha, her best friend, sat in a hospital bed, perfectly content, glowing even. Her hair was freshly brushed, braided in a long Dutch braid with oddly two pieces hanging out in the front, deliberately, messily taken out from the braid. She followed the strand down, finding it pulled taunt in front of her face, but her eyes were focused downward. And holding the end of her hair tightly, was a very, very tiny hand. Stubby fingers clung to it, not really pulling, just holding against her sternum. And nestled there– curled into Agatha’s chest, wrapped in the blanket Lilia recognized Agatha knitting before, was a baby. Copy&amp;paste. His face was partially hidden, turned into his mother as he drank noisily, humming in a way that content babies do. But, even from the doorway, even with his face hidden, and eyes only for Mama, Lilia could see it. The cheeks, the skin, even the shape of his head was Rio through and through save for the thick dark hair on his head. Too thick to be Rio’s, and too dark to be Agatha’s. </p><p>Agatha looked up and met Lilia’s gaze. Blues were sparkling, her face bare of makeup, etched with exhaustion as well– slightly pale, but Gods, Lilia had never seen such softness in Agatha Harkness, not even for Rio Vidal. Her best friend looked like a whole new person, someone softer and all the fiercer at the same time. Lilia’s lips parted in awe, a breath caught as Agatha’s smile was directed at her.</p><p>“Lilia,” she smirked now, her gloating best friend back before her, but still, the sharpness was missing. </p><p>“Agatha,” Lilia echoed, but her voice was catching. </p><p>She stepped in slowly, like being accessed to some holy grounds guarded by Hekabe, one of Hecate’s hounds, herself. Behind her was probably the worst of all hounds to exist, aggressive, possessive, and worse– a mother of the child before her eyes. Okay, so Lilia was scared of Rio. It was fair, the woman took great joy of scaring Lilia back in their college days just by hissing at her. </p><p>“I come bearing gifts,” she said, lifting the basket. “Your favorite cookies and some PJ pants. I ordered them myself.” </p><p>Rio let out a tired laugh and closed the door behind her. </p><p>“Gods, you’re the best” she muttered, brushing past to take the basket and set it on the small cot by the window. “She’s been craving something sweet since this morning.” </p><p>Agatha tilted her head slightly, “Snickerdoodles?” </p><p>“Of course,” Lilia came closer to the bed, careful to stay just on the edge. </p><p>Her hands were already itching to hold him, but she didn’t ask. She already knew the answer, especially when the guard dog of a mom came up behind her, already handing a cookie to her wife.  </p><p>“And gingerbread rabbits,” she added, watching Agatha stare at his name written in green.</p><p>“How did you know his name?” she asked, barely able to set her head back unless she pulled her hair away from stubby fingers.</p><p>They all remained quiet at that question though, Rio turning her back as she pulled out the PJs, ignoring her wife’s glare.</p><p>“<em> Cariño, </em>look! It’s those fluffy PJ bottoms! Lilia even got you bunnies on them and– why are their leaves on the ass of mine?” </p><p>Lilia bit her lip to stifle a laugh as she watched Agatha’s jaw clench. </p><p>“<em> Rio,” </em>Agatha growled lowly, making the guard dog stiff before turning slowly. </p><p>Her wife kicked at the ground like a child being caught with her hand in the cookie jar, “I might have let his name slip when you forced me to go out with Hela, Alice, and Jen.” </p><p>At that, both heads whipped to Lilia, “So how do <em> you </em>know?” </p><p>She shrugged, “Alice told me.” </p><p>They both rolled their eyes at that before a displeased grunt echoed into the room. It was the only warning before a soft wail followed. Lilia stepped back as both mothers shot into action, barely sparing her a glance as Rio grabbed a burp cloth Lilia had made. Lilia smiled, real and soft, as Rio placed it on her shoulder, Nicholas squirming against his mother before his other mother took him into her arms. </p><p>“<em> Ven aqui, mijito, </em>” Rio murmured, pressing a kiss to his cheek as her hand moved to better support his head and the other, rubbing his back as his cries slowly subsided. </p><p>Lilia turned to her best friend, “You two already have it down– he’s what, two days old?”</p><p>Agatha smiled, but her gaze was on her wife and son, Rio swaying as she murmured loving nonsense in Spanish, “Yeah, we have, but… <em> she’s </em> good with him.” </p><p>Lila reached out, setting a hand on her knee, “So are you– I already see it.”</p><p>A small sound echoed behind them, cooing following it and Nicky was placed back in Agatha’s arms. That was when Lilia saw his face, his full face. Big, solemn eyes blinked up at Agatha– and Lilia’s gaze was flicking between Rio and Nicholas… warm brown eyes, the same soft cheeks, that same little button on the top of their noses. Gods… even the shape of the eyes matched Rio’s– wide, almond, and something that made him look far too knowing for someone so new to the world. As if there was something more ancient than the earth in his soul. </p><p>“Gods, he really is Copy&amp;paste,” she muttered more to herself than anyone. </p><p>Rio chuckled before hiding it with a cough when Agatha snapped her head up, “What?” </p><p>Lilia shook her head, “Nothing– he just has your chin.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio left minutes later, kissing her wife and son goodbye before reluctantly heading out, catching an uber back home. They were alone, Nicky back to feeding after being burped and once more clinging to a strand of Agatha’s hair. </p><p>“He is obsessed with your hair,” she smiled, sitting on the edge of the bed. </p><p>Agatha smiled, caressing his tiny cheek with her thumb, “Yeah, just like his <em> mami </em>.”</p><p>She sucked in a breath, her eyes never leaving him, “He really is Rio.” </p><p>His mother snorted, before her voice softened, no longer edged with a sharpness that was always vowed to be there. </p><p>“<em> Nine months </em> . For nine months <em> I </em> carried him– and <em> he </em> has the fucking audacity coming out a clone of Rio.” </p><p>Lilia chuckled low, watching as the babe unlatched and turned to look up at his mother, both hands just holding onto her hair as he cooed. Agatha caressed his cheek with her thumb, causing another coo to ring into the room. He lifted his arms towards her face, refusing to let go, and yet the message was clear in baby language. He wanted to be closer. Tiny legs crunched up as his mother lifted him, laying him on her chest, her heart just beneath his ear. He nuzzled there, <em> Mini Rio’s </em> face scrunching up in a yawn as chubby hands pulled the strands of hair closer to him.  </p><p>“He’s perfect,” Agatha whispered into his head. </p><p>Lilia smirked, “I’ll make sure to tell Rio you said that.” </p><p>“<em> Don’t you dare. </em>I’ll never hear the end of it.” </p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>
<b>Agatha</b>
</p><p> </p><p>She felt bad… </p><p>well, sort of…</p><p>not really. </p><p> </p><p>Actually, not at all. </p><p> </p><p>She pushed a nine-pound baby out of her vagina and promptly bled out in their kitchen. </p><p>Agatha deserved this. </p><p>She deserved sleeping the moment Nicky was done feeding– after she stood, and walked the two steps to his crib, and standing over him, her ass probably sticking out from the hospital gown. Lilia only stood by her side, there if she were to fall, as they watched her swaddled son sleep– the happiest little baby as he even cooed in his sleep– probably dreaming of the womb or maybe of one of his protectors. The one that looked like him, the one who had that voice that would whisper to him through the night, the one that he constantly reached out to when he felt the pressure… the one that caught him the moment he was roughly shoved into a world too bright, too loud– a world that wasn’t always sounded by a steady rhythm of a drum– beating all around him. Or maybe he was dreaming of that voice– as soothing as rain on a metal roof, as ethereal as whales singing from the deep. The one that would sing a familiar song of a road– or ramble long lessons of some Old English story that in the end– was somehow a classic. </p><p>Most of all, she hoped that he dreamed of steady, safe brown eyes staring down at him, of a bright gaped-tooth smile that only she or he could bring– of honey-toned arms that were strong, grounding, and soft all at once. </p><p>That’s what she dreamed of– well, first was the pain, the nightmare– </p><p> </p><p>
<em> The moment her water broke, stumbling into their own kitchen until those rich soil eyes were on her and stayed with her. And then they were ripped away– lights too bright– too demanding– so many eyes glowing at her that she half wondered if she was in hell as hands were on her. Buttons were beeping, screaming in warning– becoming faster and faster as her breath was lost– those brown eyes were lost. Doctors yelled her name, nurses restrained her, and it all went dark again. And then, she was back– Rio was back, holding him.  </em>
</p><p>           </p><p>Agatha woke up again, her eyes flickering through the room, panicked. The lights were dimmed, only sunlight peeking through the blinds and curtains. But it was enough to plunge her into the pit of fear– her eyes widening, her breath stopping as tremors started in her hands, clutching the railing of the bed. </p><p>
<em> Where was Rio?  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Where was her son?  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Where was Lilia? </em>
</p><p>And then she saw them<em> .  </em></p><p>They were standing over Nicholas, Rio having one hand in the crib as she murmured softly to their friend. It was then that Lilia, nodded her head, and grabbed her purse before walking out of the room, the door clicking shut behind her. Her wife didn’t see her wake up, her eyes remained downcast at Nicky, but that’s when the dream haze wore off. </p><p>Brown eyes were dark, not bright– not golden like they normally shone when looking down at their not-so-little victory. They were puffy, red rimmed, overflowing with tears that were now painting the cheeks she loved to hold so tenderly. She couldn’t move for a moment, frozen as Rio’s jaw trembled, her chest rising and falling heavily. Her body strained– fighting itself from breaking, and yet, breaking even further. </p><p>“Rio,” she whispered, too scared to startle her. </p><p>Her wife looked up at her and the moment their eyes locked, Rio crumbled. She crouched down to the ground, out of sight, and hidden by their son’s crib. Agatha stood weakly, her stomach cramping still, and Gods, her vagina fucking hurt– sore as fuck– as if she had been ripped open… maybe she had. But none of that mattered, what mattered was her wife, the strongest woman she knew, was trembling on the ground, crying into her hands. </p><p>Her knees were brought up to her chest and she was in a different outfit. She wore one of Agatha’s biker shorts and a sweatshirt that Agatha swore went missing years ago. Her fingertips were raw, the nails shorter than ever– and Rio’s nails were short… but not <em> that </em> short. Agatha’s heart lurched, everything in her wanting to fall to her knees and pull her wife into her arms. But her body was healing and something told her that if she tried, Rio would freak out harder. </p><p>“My love,” she murmured, her fingers running through raven hair on the top of her wife’s head. “I need you to stand up for me, please. You can do it, sweetheart.” </p><p>Agatha coaxed her wife a little more, keeping her tone calm, but strong– meanwhile everything in her wanted to break down crying with her. Instead, she held it, watching her wife get up on unstable legs. Together they made their way to the too small bed, her wife burying her face into her neck, the moment they laid down. Agatha laid on her back, letting her fingers scratch over her wife’s scalp, playing with the baby hairs on the back of her neck, and back to her scalp. She didn’t speak. Speaking would make things worse for Rio when she was like this. So, she just held her as much as her body would allow, kissing the top of her head as her neck became sticky with tears.</p><p>They laid like that for a long time, enough where nurses came in twice, checking their sleeping son and asking if she was alright. She nodded them off, a begging look in her eyes, telling them she was fine for now. But her wife wasn’t, because the third hour mark hit, Rio was still crying, and their son was growing fussy in his crib, his lips smacking– whining softly. </p><p>Agatha kissed Rio’s head once and then again, peppering it with kisses, getting her head to move where she could kiss a soaked cheek, “Sweetheart, Nicky needs to be fed.”</p><p>Her wife nodded, keeping her head into her neck for a moment longer, before sitting up. Rio stretched, cracking her neck before lifting their son from his crib. Agatha unbuttoned the gown as she brought him over, putting him in her arms before sitting beside her. He latched with greed, he sucked hard, his hand already against her skin, searching for her hair. Instead, Rio laid beside her, placing her own finger in his hand, watching as it could barely wrap around her pointer. They laughed softly, watching his eyes squint, listening to the suckles and swallows as he refused to let go of her wife’s finger.</p><p>Then, petals brushed against the top of her breast, not in any means sexual, just there, sweetly. Another was placed to her shoulder, then to her neck, her cheek, and finally, her lips where she met her halfway. Humming into the kiss, she leaned partially towards her, as much as she was allowed as her heart finally started to settle. They pulled away, but not far– never far. Their noses brushed, their foreheads touching as warmth went straight to her bones, a smile creeping into her lips, unable to be contained.</p><p>Gods, she was falling in love all over again, and the best part was that she got to do it with the woman she had loved for fifteen years.</p><p>But the tension in Rio’s shoulders was still there, latching onto her even as they breathed in sync together, calming each other the only way they knew they could without words. For once, their eyes weren’t on each other, they were down at the baby who stared back up at them with equal love and trust. The pudgy little hand let go of his <em> mami’s </em> finger, before grasping at it again, bringing it closer to him, his eyes wide and curious before they focused back on them. Nicky then squinted into that milk drunk expression, making them both chuckle. </p><p>Agatha flinched when the nose against hers pulled away, her heart back to hammering as she looked up into large almond brown eyes, the tears falling silently as Rio’s voice was a hoarse whisper, “I cleaned the kitchen, but–”</p><p>Her breaths grew faster again, her chest sucking in, and sucking in– never breathing out, “I-I scrubbed– and I-I scr-scrubbed– but– but–” </p><p>“My love,” she interrupted gently. “I’m here. <em> Estoy aquí, mi amor. </em>” </p><p>She settled her hand over the tiny one, where Nicky was grasping. </p><p>Agatha kissed her lips, mumbling into them. </p><p>“It’s okay,” she breathed, “You did everything right, my love,” placing another kiss, tasting salt, “You delivered him, and you saved me.” </p><p>Her thumb whipped the tears away, her lips pressing everywhere they could as she held both her son’s and wife’s hands. Reminding not only her wife, but also herself, that through it all, through the blood that wasn’t yet lifted from their floors, through all the pain, through all the trauma before them… they got the best thing from it. And sure, they were scarred a little from it, but they shared it, and from that death– almost death– came life.</p><p> </p><p align="center">“It’s okay now… </p><p align="center">Take a breath…</p><p align="center">Please, my love…</p><p align="center">breathe.”</p><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><hr/><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Agatha nuzzled her head into the pillow of the couch. Tired of her bed, but too tired to try to do anything. Her eyes were heavy, closing and refusing to open as <em> The Phantom of the Opera </em>sang quietly from the television. Other than that, the house was quiet and still. She had just laid Nicky down for his nap… or maybe that was a couple hours ago. Her breasts felt full again and yet, she swore he had just fed.    </p><p> </p><p>They were home. Finally. Four days in the hospital. Four days of lying in a hospital bed, of really only walking around the halls, of being monitored, of too many people that weren’t her wife seeing her basically naked. And to top it all off, the moment she got her wife to calm down after reliving the experience, cleaning the blood from their floors– Nicky decided to stay latched to her. Without pattern he would cry, wanted to be in her arms, wanted to be nursed, and he was dramatic about it. The nurses assured them that it was normal, and somehow the third day was just as bad. </p><p>But now, Nicky was two weeks and two days old… and developed a schedule of waking them up every two to three hours. She caught on though, finding it was exactly two hours and forty-seven minutes he wanted to nurse and he always nursed between twenty to thirty minutes. He could never be under fed, but if it was over– either her and her wife would receive a gift of spit up on their shirts, their hair, or one time Nicky got it on Rio’s face. Agatha had only laughed, and called it karma for Rio constantly licking her face. Yet the nights were long, repetitively getting up to go to his room before he would cry, sitting in a rocking chair– or Rio going to get him and Agatha lying on her side in bed as he fed. Rio would stay through it all, rubbing her back, kissing her quietly– sometimes feeding her snacks through the night while Nicky fed. In the mornings, she would wake up to Rio bringing Nicky in before disappearing down the hall to make eggs. Nothing fancy, no over-easy, no sunny side up– just scrambled and some toast. They would go to the living room and practically collapse, Nicky either feeding or sleeping in the bassinet with Señor Scratchy laying nearby. </p><p>In truth, they didn’t really know what day it was, just counting how long they had him. Holding each other when the other cried– mainly Agatha crying. Postpartum was a bitch. Her hormones felt everywhere– she was bleeding, well it was normal for postpartum, but it was annoying. She was moody– more than usual, crying at everything, snapping at Rio– which Agatha would cry immediately afterwards. But Rio would just hold her, kiss her lips, take Nicky the moment she was done feeding him to burp him and rock him to sleep so she could get the most rest as possible. Her nipples were sore– luckily not cracked as Nicky’s latch was perfect, but they hurt. She still had cramps that had her pausing in between sentences. And her wife would bring her creams, hold her in their long showers together– wash her hair, brush her teeth when she was too tired to go to the bathroom– would also know when she needed the heated pad to ease the cramps, still anointed oils to her belly– drawing runes of healing, strength, and protection. </p><p>Rio would sit and watch musicals with her for when it was a comfort thing she needed between sleeping and dozing off. And not that Rio knew that <em> Agatha </em> knew… Rio hated musicals, but she watched them for her. When it came to dinner, Lilia would drop off enough food for a week every Monday. At least that’s what Lilia said– again, Agatha had no idea what day of the week it was. </p><p>All she knew was that she was half awake– well barely, she could hear around her but her body refused to let her open her eyes. She was content that way and the best part was she could sleep on her back. So, she laid there, her hair in a ruined braid, an arm covering her eyes, pretty sure there was spit up on her nursing tank top, and comfortably in the overly-fluffy pajama pants Lilia bought her. Señor Scratchy laid at her feet, his fur brushing up against her as he groomed himself, but that bunny never left her side the moment Lilia returned him. He only moved when Rio was in the way or if their son was there, yet Scratchy kept a watchful eye on him. When Nicholas slept in the bassinet in the living room for the first time, they watched as he peered in before blinking up at both of them, his nose twitching at them almost to say, <em> What the fuck is that? </em></p><p>But then, he just began sleeping near him, never touching the bassinet, never touching him when he was awake, feeding from Agatha– just there, watching, waiting for the mothers to formally introduce them. </p><p> </p><p>Something was touching her face, something soft and familiar. First it was her cheek, just a simple press that made Agatha flinch away before stilling again. Then another to her neck. She groaned, refusing to lift her arm to see what it was before it was attacking her face. Peppering over her– her cheeks, her jaw,  her neck, her nose, and when it reached her lips– she bared her teeth, making Rio kiss them instead. </p><p>“Eugh,” her wife protested. “I hate when you do that.”</p><p>She didn’t move, just smirked, “Mm, and I hate when you wake me up.” </p><p>Rio huffed a laugh before kissing her lips again. Agatha allowed her, her own lips pressing back, her arm falling from her face so she could cup her wife’s cheeks. </p><p>“Unfortunately, <em> cariño, </em>you forgot to set an alarm and Nicky wants his lunch,” her wife hummed before kissing her cheek. “Don’t worry. I’ll get him.”</p><p>Agatha watched as her wife stood, practically skipping down the hall to the nursery. She raised an eyebrow, something in her telling that something was up. Rio had energy… a lot of energy. After this feeding session, both her and Rio either curled up in bed or the couch and fell asleep until the alarm went off. And after the nap, was another feed before Nicky would actually stay awake for a little bit, cooing up at them or happily bouncing in Rio’s arms. <em> That </em>was when Rio had energy. So yeah, her wife was up to something. </p><p>“<em> Cariño!” </em>her wife called from the hall. “Close your eyes!” </p><p>Agatha turned her head, sitting up on the couch as she unbuttoned the flap of fabric over her breast, already feeling the let down of milk ready for her son. </p><p>“My love, what are you doing?” <br/>Her wife was cooing at the baby, laughing at him as he responded back with fierce baby grunts. </p><p>Rio laughed low, “Just close your eyes. It’s a surprise.”</p><p>A surprise? </p><p>For her? </p><p>What could possibly Rio have planned? </p><p>She hadn’t left the house since they brought him home– well, minus running to get a different nipple cream and a new heating pad, and she was back home faster than ever before. They ordered everything else online, from the postpartum fucking diapers– yeah, she had to wear fucking diapers too– new rugs in the kitchen to cover the blood stains Rio couldn’t get out, to ice packs for her vagina and, new stretch mark cream that Agatha insisted on from Greece. She would never admit it, but some nights she loved when Rio would kiss the stretch marks, would gently nuzzle into her belly where it all loose skin and winkles, and wear that stupid puppy-dog smile on her face before rubbing the cream over all the stretch marks, but would always stop with a kiss to each area– from her belly, to her thighs and hips, and even her ass. Gods, she loved that stupid dork. </p><p>Before she could ponder more, she heard excited footstops and Rio humming to calm him down. He had to be fussy. She <em> was </em> surprised he wasn’t crying. Normally, a minute over his time for eating– that means his whole world is ending. She heard the little whine from his throat that meant he was hungry and was tempted to snatch him off Rio so he could be fed. Instead, she waited until the couch shifted and felt her wife’s leg against her own. </p><p>“Okay, open!” </p><p>Agatha did, and she blinked… and then she blinked again just to be sure what she was seeing. </p><p>Rio had the stupidest grin on her face, her cheeks stretched and puffed up where she had thought about pinching them more than once. Her almond eyes squinted, the brown glistening in pure joy, and that gap between her teeth proudly on display. Because sitting in her lap was their son… in a white and caramel spotted bunny onesie. His hands and feet covered, pink little paws on all of all four sleeves. Nicky stared up at her with the same big brown eyes, blinking unknowingly, and smacking his lips as his nose even twitched like a bunny’s. And on his head was a hood with bunny ears standing up. </p><p>“Rio… what is this?” she asked in awe, her heart on steroids, unable to take in the sight in front of her. </p><p>Her wife giggled, lifting him to place kisses on his chubby cheeks, “Our <em> conejito! </em> ‘Cause you called him a bunny when he was still in your belly. It was gonna be a surprise when we left the hospital, but I kinda forgot– here!” </p><p>Rio handed him over, kissing her cheek before running off somewhere else.</p><p>“I have one more thing!” </p><p><em> Gods, help me if he has the same exact personality </em>, she thought, eyes following her wife as she ran out of the back door like an excited toddler. </p><p>She turned back her son, cupping his cheek, and tapping his nose, “You, <em> mister, </em>are too fucking cute.” </p><p>He smacked his lips in response, his face scrunching up in protest. Agatha didn’t bother to cover the snort that left her, warmth spilling from her chest as she pulled a breast free. Lips smacked again as she adjusted the bunny-hooded baby in her arms, pulling him to settle him at her breast. He latched on instantly, greedily, happily filling his belly without a care in the world. Useless gloved hands flexed, reaching up before settling against her, eyelashes fluttering as delicately as a butterfly. </p><p>“<em> Conejito </em> ,” she whispered, voice barely audible above the little snuffles and gulps of milk. “Do you even know what your <em> mami </em> just did to you? You’re matching with the little bunny at my feet.”</p><p>She rocked slightly, brushing her fingers down the bunny suit’s velvet-soft ear, still disbelieving. Nicky’s feet twitched beneath the padded paws, and she could already imagine the stories Rio would tell him later– about matching with the bunny, how she always tried melting Mama with costumes– which Agatha was sure there was more to come. </p><p>The backdoor grated open and Rio was back, hurrying from around the couch to face her. She stood in front of her this time, sweat on her brow from the hot outside air, and she was pretty sure there was a smear of dirt on her cheek. But it was what was in her arms that made her freeze, her breath catching in her as a bucket of guilt splashed over her. </p><p>Rio was holding a bouquet of azaleas, like it was something sacred. Each bloom was open, full, and fat with dark purple shades– clustered so carefully so none were crushed, and bound together with a ribbon of green and purple. Her eyes flickered back to her wife’s excited, but loving brown eyes, and the guilt was now sticking to her skin, to her bones. </p><p>Her wife was smiling at her like she was gifted beauty from Aphrodite. Not staring at her like she was a mess as if she wasn’t still heavy and showing from carrying, as if there weren’t deep, dark bags under her eyes, as if she wasn’t sitting on their couch, with the same outfit as yesterday on, breastfeeding their son. </p><p>Agatha felt her eyes counting the flowers, narrowing over them until her vision went blurry. </p><p><em>Fifteen…</em> fifteen azaleas… because today was <em>June</em> <em>second</em>. </p><p>June second… their wedding anniversary… ten years of marriage today, but Rio had always claimed she felt as if they were always married, and today was just her favorite day of signing the papers for it to be official.   </p><p>“Happy anniversary, <em> cariño, </em>” her wife set the flowers down on the table, her smile still bright as her gaze drifted to their son who was in milk heaven. </p><p>When they glided back up, Rio’s face paled, and Agatha realized she was crying, tears dripping off her cheeks. Agatha sniffed sharply, the guilt cleaving through her like a blade. </p><p>“Oh Gods– my love– it’s our anniversary– Rio, I-I’m so s-sorry– I didn’t–”</p><p>A kiss stopped the ramble, warm and firm. Her wife sat beside her, a hand on her cheek so a thumb could wipe her tears. Rio leaned in, not expecting her to do so with a baby between them, and kissed her slow, real, and full of nothing but utter devotion. </p><p>“<em> Cariño </em> ,” Rio murmured, her voice low, “it’s okay. Agatha, <em> mi amor </em>, you just gave birth two weeks ago. You’re healing. You’re not sleeping. I’m not upset.” </p><p>She gave a breath of laughter. </p><p>“Fuck, I didn’t even remember until Lilia asked if I had the ingredients to cook something nice for you tonight.” </p><p>They both laughed at that, softly and achingly as Agatha let Rio guide her body to rest her back against her chest, Rio’s chin resting on her shoulder as they both stared down at <em>conejito </em>who was in a world of his own. </p><p>Agatha turned her head, nuzzling into her wife’s cheek, “Should we do something tonight if we both forgot?” </p><p>Her wife hummed, kissing her, “Mm, well our usual plans are off the table.” </p><p>She snorted, “As much as going out for a romantic dinner sounds amazing– I don’t feel like trying to figure out where I can breastfeed him when I’m still learning– and <em> you’re </em>not putting your dick anywhere near me.” </p><p>“Agatha! Tiny ears,” Rio scolded. </p><p>Agatha smirked, her lips circling upward as her eyes narrowed playfully at her wife, “I’m gonna teach him how to say ‘cunty’ as his first word.” </p><p>“Yeah,” her wife hummed against her ear, not taking the bait. “Well, I’ll just get him to say ‘<em> mami’ </em> first and then then what, <em> mi amor? </em>” </p><p>Blue fire flashed in Agatha’s eyes, “Yeah, and how much do you want to bet he says ‘mama’ first?” </p><p>A hand brushed against Nicky’s cheek when he unlatched, making a displeased grunt. Her wife took him, both of them sitting up so their son could sit on Rio’s lap, his chubby cheeks being squeezed by her forefinger and thumb as his chin rested in the corner of where they connected. Her wife leaned him forward before setting a gentle rhythm on his back.</p><p>“How about if the loser has to do the sex talk when he’s older?” Rio smirked, eyeing her before a tiny burp from the baby bunny made them chuckle.</p><p>Agatha blew the air out of her mouth, whistling softly, “Already going for the big guns, my love.”</p><p>“Of course, so deal or not?” Rio bared her teeth, placing Nicky back in her arms </p><p>He latched eagerly. His eyes wide, laced with innocence and newness as he studied her face. Agatha didn’t respond for a moment, already feeling her tears threatening to prick at her eyes. He was still so small, so reliant on her– that even the thought of him one day being taller than her, made her sick. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Knock. Knock. Knock.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>They both startled, even Nicky who flinched before clinging tighter to her. She met Rio’s eyes, watching them cloud in confusion, her head tilting as she stood. Her own fluffy pajama pants clung to her, the monstera leaves cupping her ass nicely as Agatha couldn’t help but smirk watching her make her way to the door. The door swung open and Rio grew rigid, staring at whoever was there. </p><p>“<em> Ay, Riocita!” </em>a familiar voice screeched. “I can’t believe you! No texts! No photos! No phone calls!” </p><p>Right… they still hadn’t told anybody that Nicholas was officially here. The only person who knew was Lilia… and Lilia promised…</p><p>“I went to Lilia’s and found her making dinners for you!” Oriana now stepped into their house, heading straight to the kitchen like she owned the place as more figures followed. </p><p>A throat cleared, Alice’s voice joining in, “Ori called us. Of course we had to come, Rio. Plus, you look like shit.” </p><p>Her wife scoffed, a dark energy rolling off in waves, crawling up the walls of the house. The shadows moved, shrinking back from her wife as the door slammed when she shut it behind her. Señor Scratchy bolted, his legs carrying him down the hall to hide most likely under their bed as even the plants shrinked back. </p><p>“Oh, it’s just that maternal glow,” Hela mocked her, new voices laughing with her as they drifted to the kitchen. </p><p>The coven was in their house, and Rio… her sweet, overprotective wife was about to lose it. From a distance she could see the way her fists clenched, the veins running through her hands as her head twitched to the side. </p><p>Oh. </p><p>
<em> Oh.  </em>
</p><p>Rio was furious.</p><p>“Now, where is my <em> sobrino?” </em> Oriana rushed from the kitchen, coming towards the living where Nicky was still nursing. </p><p>Agatha shot her hand out, grabbing the blanket she knitted for him to cover herself just as Oriana burst into the room. Her smile was huge, stretching her cheeks to the point she was sure they were going to rip. The coven followed behind– Jen, Alice, and Hela flanking her. She silently thanked Lilia for not coming, at least someone actually understood social queues. </p><p>Behind her, the cushions shifted, a honey toned arm crossing her vision before the nursing shawl was wrapped around her, Rio taking the blanket so Nicky could finish in peace– which he was taking his sweet time about it too. </p><p>“You could have called before coming,” Rio’s voice was low, dark behind her, as a hand rested possessively on her shoulder. </p><p>Oriana was the first to wave her off, “Like you called to let us know he was born? Did you even tell <em> Abuelita </em> ? She’s going to <em> freaking </em> curse you, <em> hermanita.”  </em></p><p>Agatha snorted at the word ‘freaking,’ but her wife was deathly tense behind her. Her fingers curled on her shoulder, and even Agatha was facing their friends, Hela plopping down at the far end of the couch, seeming the only one who took notice of her wife, whose jaw was probably clenched and steam was  blowing out of her nose. Jen and Alice sat in the chair, Jen on Alice’s lap as Oriana stood before her, looking down at the shawl over Nicky with such intensity, it felt as if she could see through it. The moment Agatha flinched, she knew her wife would spring into action. </p><p>“She will find out soon, Ori– and from <em> me </em> , not <em> you. </em>Agatha is still recovering. She doesn’t need the whole Vidal family doting on her,” her wife replied sharply. </p><p>“Oh, come on, <em> Riocita. </em> Don’t be like that. He <em> should </em>be introduced to his family at a young age anyway.” </p><p>“He’s two weeks old.” </p><p>The older sister scoffed, “And? I was four when I held you at that age. <em> Amá </em>breastfed you right in front of us.” </p><p>Oh, Agatha was not doing this. </p><p>She reached up, placing a hand on top of her wife’s as her voice boomed, “Enough!”</p><p>Hela coughed into her hand, muttering something, but there was a spark in her eyes, almost as if she was enjoying the spectacle as she leaned back into the couch, but clearly unwilling to throw herself into the wildfire. Jen and Alice looked at each other, speaking to each other with eyes that read : <em> Should we leave? </em> And Alice gave her the look of <em> too late now </em>. Oriana, meanwhile, huffed dramatically and folded her arms, nails tapping her elbow staring down at her. And Nicky? He didn’t have a care in the world. He merely unlatched and gave a soft coo against her breast. </p><p>The moment the note left his throat, the room froze, the tension evaporating from everyone… but her wife who leaned over the couch, reaching to take him out from under the nursing shawl. The steady hush fell over them, something sacred as he was slowly revealed from under the shawl and deposited into Rio’s arms. Rio walked around, sitting next to her wife, setting him on her lap to burp him. And that was when they all saw his face, squished in Rio’s soft but calloused hands burping loudly before lifting his arms up and making another noise. </p><p>A different cooing began, Oriana finding a seat next to her sister, everyone staring as Rio brought him to her chest. </p><p>“Oh goddess, look at him!” Jen whispered, leaning forward, her hands pressed over her heart as Alice peered over her shoulder. </p><p>“Shut the fuck up–”</p><p>A chorus of “Alice!”s echoed in the room, but both Agatha and Alice didn’t care. </p><p>“He’s in that bunny onesie you fucking bought him, Rio– oh my gods– I didn’t think he would be this cute,” her eyes wide, her body moving forward, almost pushing Jen to the floor. “Oh– the ears!”</p><p>Hela huffed a laugh, but green eyes were uncharacteristically soft and wide, grazing over Nicky before gasping, “Rio, he looks like you.” </p><p>Agatha watched as their son blinked up at Rio, oblivious and doe-like– brown eyes that were Rio’s exactly– unimpressed, but secretly calculating. His lips twitched into a faint smile, the muscles barely working before his hand reached up, finding Rio’s hair to hold. </p><p>“It’s kinda scary,” Jen added. “Like Agatha, are you sure you were the one that carried him?”</p><p>They both faintly flinched at that. Her wife almost more-so as brown eyes flicked to the kitchen where she pulled Nicky from her, but it was still too raw to bring up– that’s how he was brought into the world– with Agatha minutes away from death’s embrace. Agatha fixed her shirt, pulling the shawl off of her body before placing her hand on Rio’s thigh, easing the bouncing and nerves. </p><p>Agatha flashed Jen a venomous smile, “Would you like to see my vagina right now? Or would like to fetch my ice pack for it in the freezer?” </p><p>Her hands went up in defeat, her lip curling in disgust as Agatha merely turned back to their son. She reached up, her eyes dancing at him as she smoothed a dark curl from Nicky’s brow. But that was when she noticed Oriana was still as stone. Barely breathing as if she would spook Rio away from her, which she might. Her hands were helplessly limp in her lap and she lost that combative sibling fight in her. She was soft as well as stiff, her gaze never leaving him, watching his hand hold her younger sister’s hair. Her eyes traced the bunny ears now racing down his back as he did that little newborn scrunch on Rio’s chest. But the covered hand still held Rio’s hair with all its might. </p><p>Agatha took a breath, her hand moving to Rio’s back as she answered Oriana’s question in the form of her own, “Would you like to hold him?”</p><p>Her wife went rigid, her whole body tightening like a string on a violin.</p><p>“No,” Rio snapped, her voice sharp, border-lining a growl. </p><p>“My love,” Agatha murmured, her hand playing with the baby hairs on the base of her neck. “Let her try.” </p><p>Rio looked down at their son, before her eyes narrowed to her hands. Her voice came out low– a tone in which no one should argue against. </p><p>“If any of you want to hold him,” she started. “You will go to the kitchen and wash your hands. You will <em> not </em> kiss him. You <em> must </em> support his neck. And you <em> will </em>be seated.”</p><p>“Hela literally has a baby–” Alice started before stopping at the look Rio gave them. </p><p>They scrambled, running to the kitchen like a couple of teenagers fighting for shotgun. Agatha chuckled, shaking her head before leaning in and kissing her wife’s cheek. </p><p>“You’re hot when you get protective like that.”</p><p>“Agatha,” her wife groaned, falling back on the couch. </p><p>She smirked, “You’re right. Four more weeks, my love.” </p><p>Her wife glared at her, but straightened when Oriana came back sitting down next to her slowly. The others followed standing in line, each on their toes as they stared at him. Rio sighed and handed him over, slow and reluctant, guiding his small weight into Oriana’s arms. And for one glorious, fragile second, it seemed like it might be fine. Nicky blinked up at her, brown eyes almost as owlish as Rio’s as Oriana murmured in Spanish at her nephew. That’s when the milk drunken expression vanished, one replaced by utter fear and betrayal. His face collapsed, and he screamed. The wail was piercing, his little arms flaring– so dramatically distressed as if Rio was giving him up permanently. </p><p>“O-okay– <em> ay, conejito– </em> it’s okay!” Oriana panicked, trying to rock him as her face fell with him. “Why is he doing that?! <em> Hermanita! </em>Agatha!” </p><p>The group cackled behind her, and Alice was squeezing down next to her, “Amateur, give him to me.” </p><p>Oriana passed him over, standing and backing away, betrayal written all over her own face as Alice shifted closer to Rio, rocking him herself while humming at him. Agatha sat back, her eyebrows raised in surprise, especially when Rio leaned back too, but then Rio covered her chest again with the shawl. </p><p>“Let-down reflex, <em> mi amor,” </em> she murmured, kissing her cheek just as she felt it. </p><p>Right, her body was responding to their son’s cries. </p><p>Nicky’s cries grew more dramatic by the second, red-faced and flailing as Jen swooped in next before passing him to Hela– the most experienced in the group. Hela held him, not close, but gently, her eyes moving over him before simply passing him into Agatha’s arms. Agatha felt her shoulders relax, not even realizing her body was on high alert as she pressed Nicky against her, kissing his curls. The moment the first kiss landed, the crying ceased, and he drifted off in the safety of his Mama’s arms. </p><p>“Gods, he’s as dramatic as you,” Alice muttered, rubbing at her ears. </p><p>Hela stood back up, punching Rio playfully in the arm, “Yeah, good luck with that one.” </p><p>But Agatha wasn’t paying attention to them, holding her son close, nuzzling into the top of his head with her nose. She caressed his cheek– baby soft– as he curled into her chest, almost as if he was burrowing there. Agatha was in her own world with him, just seeing that his eyes were still open. She moved him to the crook of her arm, making soft faces at him, watching brown eyes following each delicate motion. </p><p>The room around them softened to a blur. The voices dimmed, the walls dissolved. There was only him. Only Nicky. The quiet flutter of his lashes, the tiniest furrow of his brow as if he was already a thinker, already holding ancient secrets in a body too small to speak them. She tapped his nose gently, a faint smile curling at the edge of her lips. She half wondered what babies could think– how did he see her? Did he know that she would never hurt him– never be as cruel or evil as her own mother? That she would protect him with everything that she had? That she would level cities, fucking countries if that meant he was happy? Did he know already how loved he was– did he even know that she was his mother?</p><p>Her mind drifted even more, wondering if the more he grew, he would be as gentle and defiant as his <em> mami. </em>She could see him playing in the dirt, pointing to a spider that while Rio explained what type of spider it was, the class and Latin name of the thing– they would probably get a tarantula behind her back and Rio would send Nicky to soften the blow on her. Gods, she was so fucked– so in love. </p><p>Nicky fidgeted, his hand flexing under the glove. With ease, she unzipped him watching as his hand shot free, a tiny knuckle clinging to her hair as he just stared at her, alert and curious. And then his arms flailed a bit, his mouth smacking. Her eyebrows creased as she reached down, her finger tips ghosting his jaw, his cheek, down the slope of his nose, and the moment her finger was in front of his mouth– he latched, sucking with fury. </p><p>She laughed, wondering if he is starting a growth spurt. She read he would have one between two and three weeks, and found moms on TikTok talking about their baby always nursing at that time– but she never told Rio she was looking. Her wife would merely say <em> I told you </em>after she dismissed the clock application. But it did ease a lot of fears, especially when it came to him nursing from her, and she was too proud to admit to her wife her fears. </p><p>Agatha pulled out her finger, watching his face scrunch up as she reached under the shawl to unclasp the buttons that locked the milk bar. The shawl slid down as she let out a hot annoyed breath before pulling it in place, and trying at the clasps again. Well, trying to do it all one handed, she wasn’t fast enough, and Nicky… he inherited Agatha’s patience. His face scrunched up as he squirmed, his lips rooting against the shawl, and he <em> screamed </em>the moment he realized it wasn’t her skin. </p><p>“Okay! Everyone out!” her wife stood, her shoulders set back as her fists were clenched.</p><p>Agatha didn’t try to correct her as Nicky continued screaming, crying like he was being purposely starved. </p><p>She tried again, but Oriana was yelling back at her sister, “Oh, come on, Rio. I’m his <em> tía </em>!” </p><p>“Yeah, and he cried in your arms,” Jen snarked as she grabbed her things with Alice. “Now, let’s all go before one mom whips her boob out and the other kills us.” </p><p>Agatha stared up at Jen, muttering a, “Fuck you, Kale,” under her breath as she finally got her her shirt unhooked, but Nicky was throwing his tantrum, his little hands pulling on her hair, the sharpness on her scalp making her eyes water. Fuck, she needed Rio.</p><p>“We put more food in your fridge, have fun moms!” Hela called, already walking out the door with Jen and Alice following close behind. </p><p>Oriana was left, crossing her arms before Rio– the two sisters squared off with one another, both of their eyes darkening, but Rio’s stare was worse. </p><p>“I’ll leave if you send a photo of him to the group chat,” Oriana huffed. </p><p>Rio snorted like a bull stepping closer, “<em> You’re leaving </em> because <em> I </em> am telling you to. <em> You’re leaving </em> because Agatha is still healing and needs–”</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha needed <em> her </em>. </p><p>Nicholas was wailing now and she was still struggling with the shawl and her chest was now wet– and the world was spinning away from the little bubble she made for herself without her wife. Within seconds, the door clicked shut and Nicky was taken from her arms by her wife who was already taking him to the nursery. </p><p>Agatha could breathe, her head finally stopping the pounding as Nicholas’ cries started to tamper down. Her heart steadied and fluttered when she heard her wife’s voice, singing softly to him before Rio was coming back out– Nicholas changed into a green onesie with music notes scattered all over it, which meant Rio changed his diaper… because Nicky needed a new outfit every time his diaper changed. She pulled the shawl off her body, taking their son into her arms. And the moment he was latched, the tears dried and wide brown eyes stared up at her like she was his world.</p><p>The couch dipped beside her. Rio folded herself into the corner of the loveseat, still wound tight. Agatha held back a sigh, already knowing the shape of the storm brewing. She let Rio tug her back, her body yielding to the pull until she rested against Rio’s chest. </p><p>“You know it’s fucking ridiculous, right?” Rio growled low against her ear, making her shiver as the air around them cooled. </p><p>Agatha didn’t flinch though. She just shifted enough to get comfortable, mindful of the small body nestled in her arms. Their son reached a hand up, a clumsy little grab of fingers too small to handle anything. She offered him her finger, feeling the strength that was blossoming day by day, still just a little too small for his thumb and fingers to touch. </p><p>Her voice softened, a mutter and mock under her breath that she knew her wife could hear, “Language, Rio.” </p><p>A weight fell to Agatha’s shoulder as a taut but muffled voice replied, “I wish everyone would just leave us alone. And on our anniversary, of all days.” </p><p>“I know, love,” Agatha murmured, bracing for the deluge. </p><p>She never interrupted these rants and never tried. This was how Rio shed the weight she carried : aloud, unfiltered, like waves breaking against the shore. Agatha only leaned back into her, half-tuned to her words, half-listening instead to the quiet suckling of their son. Her eyes drifted to the soft rise and fall of his throat, the steady rhythm of him drinking. </p><p>“And Ori just suddenly thinking she’s entitled to him? And now what? <em> Abuelita </em> knocking on the door tomorrow? Gods, if she was here, I probably wouldn’t even get to <em> hold </em> him– and then they all just come in and barely even look at you—” </p><p>Agatha hummed in agreement, her thumb catching a drop of milk trailing from Nicky’s chin. He’d unlatched with a sigh, and she gently eased her finger from his grasp. Rio kept going behind her– that was until Agatha bent her knees, lifting their son to rest there, cradled on the soft hill of her thighs. Brown eyes blinked up at them, lips curling in a lopsided smile before he started blowing spit bubbles. Agatha chuckled, low in her chest, watching as his gaze shifted past her– squinting at the shadow of his <em> mami </em> behind his mama. With practiced ease, she stroked his cheek in the same way she did to calm Rio, watching as his eyes fluttered and he leaned into her touch.</p><p><em> Gods, he really is Rio, </em>she thought fondly, but her eyes narrowed back towards her wife. </p><p>“I know it’s frustrating, my love,” she spoke softly, watching as Nicky fought to keep his eyes open at them. “It has been for the last nine months– stepping out into the world where so many random people keep trying to pry open our lives to dissect it. You have a family who think they are entitled to every little aspect, that each moment is theirs to document as if we are nothing more than characters in a television show. We have friends who knock on our doors and barge in without invitation. But none of that matters, because <em> this </em>–” </p><p>Agatha took Rio’s hand without taking off the one cupping their son’s cheek. She felt Rio’s body relax into hers as she leaned forward, their hearts cuddling, beating with each other as she laid her hand to caress and hold chubby cheeks. Together, they watched as Nicky’s eyes stopped fighting. They opened once, glancing at his mama before narrowing to his <em> mami </em>who rested her chin on Agatha’s shoulder. And with another tiny yawn, he fell into their hands– trusting them to forever hold him as his own heart slowed, and sleepy sighs filled the quiet with a love that bloomed as brightly as an azalea. </p><p> </p><p align="center">“<em> This </em> is <strong><u>somewhere only we know</u></strong>.” </p><p align="center"> </p><hr/><blockquote>
