      Chapter 1: Prologue
  </h2>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>It wasn’t the alarm that woke Agatha that morning, but the impending sense of doom. Today was the day; her birthday. Among the usual angst of aging, unwanted recognition from friends and colleagues, and an obligatory dinner with her mother, she was particularly woeful about this milestone. She had told herself this was it. The last shot at creating the family that she and Wanda had always dreamed about.</p><p> </p><p>They met early in college when Agatha’s roommate Jen brought her home from a sorority function. The two girls had stumbled in and began cooking loudly in the kitchen, waking her. She stormed so fiercely out of her room that night the door handle created a dent in the wall behind it. She raged into the kitchen already screaming at Jen for waking her when she had an 8am exam the next day before realizing there was another person in the kitchen. Wanda popped up from behind the refrigerator door eating one of her cheese sticks. Giggling, she apologized for their disturbance and offered to replace the food she had been eating. Enraged, Agatha screeched and stormed back off to her room to have a fitful night’s sleep. After that evening, as Jen continued to bring Wanda over, she would bring a bag of cheese sticks for Agatha, every now and again, as an apology for their first interaction.<br/>Despite this act of kindness Agatha did her best to avoid them both whenever Wanda was over. Until one night when she and her friend Ralph brought over dinner for all of them. Wanda had managed to break down a few walls Agatha had built and even made her laugh as she poked fun at Jen. After that night Agatha began to look forward to each time Wanda would visit, ensuring she always looked her best. Half the time she would bring Ralph and the three of them would wreak havoc throughout their campus in one drunken escapade or another. Before she knew it she had fallen for this kind, bubbly, passionate, brilliant woman. She was surprised to find Wanda had similar feelings and they endeavored in a relationship that survived grad school and eventually led to marriage.<br/>Their life together had been one adventure after another. They bought a small cottage near Wanda’s hometown. Agatha worked downtown as a financial advisor while Wanda was either researching or off on another expedition. They thrived in their fields as they challenged each other’s success. It was blissful, happy, and full of love, yet doomed not to last.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda had disappeared almost 7 years ago now, off on another one of her archeological expeditions. She was brilliant, reckless, and passionate about her studies. It’s what drew Agatha to her in the first place. They way she would babble on and on about ancient goddesses and fertility rituals whose practices were nearly lost to time if it weren’t for the work she was doing. This time, while exploring a series of caverns, her team lost contact with her. They had sent rescue teams down immediately but were unable to locate her. It was weeks of searching before they decided to call.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know how to tell you this Agatha…” said the voice on the other end<br/>“SPIT IT OUT! TELL ME WHERE SHE IS!” she shouted into the receiver. Her breath heavy with tears starting to form in her eyes.<br/>“We…we don’t know. We haven’t been able to find her body.”<br/>“Her…body?! You don’t mean you’ve stopped looking? What are you even saying?”<br/>“Agatha, we found her gear near a crevice. It’s too deep and tight for any of our guys to get down any further... It’s been 3 weeks. I’m so sorry.”<br/>Wanda wasn’t even supposed to have gone on this trip. Agatha was nearly 4 months pregnant with the child they had finally decided to try for after Wanda agreed to cut back on expeditions and move into an adjunct professorship at the nearby college. Now she was faced with raising this child alone. The despair ate away at her. She had to force herself to eat for the baby. Barely able to sleep, just holding on to the last little piece of her life with Wanda. That was until her next appointment.<br/>She knew the moment the nurse smiled at her something was off. She had excused herself, saying she needed a second opinion from the doctor. He came in, cold and distant, looking at the screen as if he was just checking emails. He sat down on the stool, turned off the monitor and turned to face her.<br/>“I’m sorry to tell you this but we are unable to find a heartbeat and there is no movement. We need to schedule you for a DNC as soon as possible to avoid complications.” As if it was that matter of fact. As if she hadn’t just lost the last bit of love and hope she had. She didn’t react. She couldn’t in that moment. She just went through the motions, signed the papers and had the procedure without a tear in sight. She only collapsed in grief upon entering the threshold of their cottage. She must have spent a day at least just on the floor on the other side of the door, weeping silently as the grief passed over her in waves.<br/>She would have stayed there even longer had it not been for Jen busting her door in once she heard the news. Though she would likely never admit it, Jen had saved her that day. For how much they bickered and taunted each other, at the root of it was a sisterly bond they had forged at school.<br/>It took 2 years for her life to start to feel human again. For the grief to not hit her before dawn. She could look herself in the eyes again and not immediately begin to cry. Instead she saw the strength that these tragedies had built inside her. That was the first year she celebrated her birthday again. An all out bash, Ralph had invited everyone she had ever known, to let loose and have a moment of joy, if just for one night. In the end she wouldn’t have remembered much of it had it not been for him.<br/>Ralph had been there for the beginning of her and Wanda’s relationship. Almost like a big, gay third wheel. He would take them to all the gay bars and drag shows, in turn they would feed and house him during grad school. He could see when they would be headed for a fight and know how to diffuse the situation and how to get them to apologize to one another when he wasn’t there to calm the tensions. He was their obvious choice as a donor when they finally decided to start trying to have kids. He had been there for all the ups and downs when they were first trying to conceive. Once Agatha had gotten pregnant he accepted a series of cruise ship contracts and was away when it all fell apart. That regret was everlasting and he was constantly trying to make it up to her.<br/>He had helped plan and orchestrate the party, agreeing to stay; somewhat, sober to ensure things didn’t get too out of hand. He kept a watchful eye over Agatha and made sure at the end of the night she drank some water and took some medicine. He helped her to bed, tucking her in and in her drunken stupor begged him to stay. To hold her until she slept so she didn’t have to fall asleep alone. As he held her they talked about Wanda, about the life they had planned. About the baby they almost had and he just let her weep until she drifted off.</p><p> </p><p>In the morning she had awoken to the smell of coffee and burned bacon with a splitting headache. Making her way down the hall she found Ralph in the kitchen with her apron on attempting to make pancakes.<br/>“Morning Birthday girl! How you feeling?”<br/>“Like I’ve been run over by a bus”<br/>“5 shots of tequila and whatever else you drank will do that to you. Especially at 35!”<br/>“Eugh, don’t remind me.”<br/>“Can I offer you some breakfast? Perhaps a bloody mary, mimosa?”<br/>“If I smell alcohol right now I will puke all over this table. I don’t know how I’m even alive right now.”<br/>“How much do you remember?”<br/>“Not a whole lot, Jen and I were singing at some point. I remember cake but I don’t remember eating cake. I definitely cried at some point but the details are fuzzy.”<br/>“Girl, every time I turned around you were making out with another woman. I would’ve made sure you got laid but you were too far gone by 10 for that to be a good idea.” He chuckled before falling silent, a question hovering on his lips. Finally he asked, “Do you remember our conversation last night?”<br/>“You’ll have to enlighten me.” Her face flushed with embarrassment and nausea.<br/>“I’m only bringing it up now because you brought it up first last night and in the state you were in it felt like a confession to me. So here goes… are you serious about trying to have a kid again on your own?” She was stunned. Had she really admitted she wasn’t done trying? Hadn’t given up that hope? She sipped the now cold black coffee on the table in front of her and munched on a piece of bacon as she rolled the question around in her hungover head. At her age it wasn’t impossible but the chances lowered the longer she waited. If there was any chance at a piece of the life she had imagined, would it not be worth it in the end?<br/>“I mean, I have thought about it. But it seems crazy, especially after everything.”<br/>“You think about it. It’s a big decision, but if it’s something you’ve always wanted? You’re the only person I know crazy enough to do it and be a damn good mother. And you wouldn’t be alone. You have me for one, guncle Ralph, and you know Jen would be over the moon…eventually.”<br/>“Gods, Jen would kill me for sure! The last thing she wants is to pull me out of another pit of despair.” She sat with the thought imagining the life she really wanted now. “I don’t see myself getting into another relationship… but I’ve always known I wanted children” she said with a misty smile.<br/>“The two aren’t mutually exclusive, Agatha. There is still time, I’m here either way. At least for the next couple of months before Magic of the Seas sets sail.”</p><p> </p><p>She contemplated the offer over the next month and in the end decided she deserved to find this happiness if at all possible. Over the next few years, whenever he was in town, they would plan a night - go have dinner, sing karaoke, catch a drag show that, half the time, Ralph was hosting and afterward they would go back to her place. She’d watch a movie while he jerked it in the guest bathroom and then he’d leave her to manage the rest on her own.</p><p> </p><p>It was definitely different than when she and Wanda had tried. She remembered the effort she had gone through to ensure the day was perfect. Doting on Agatha, bringing her breakfast in bed. They spent the day outside, went to a concert, and had a romantic dinner out. They returned home as Ralph left, and spent most of the night locked in an intimate embrace. All these efforts proved fruitful and they quickly became pregnant.</p><p> </p><p>Though she tried, she couldn’t quite recreate Wanda’s magic. She was too aware of the emptiness surrounding her. It made the endeavor too practical and clinical. She was not as lucky this go around either. The first year she made 4 attempts, none of them successful. The following year the stars aligned and she was able to successfully conceive. This however was short lived as she didn’t make it past the first trimester. Devastated, she took a step back and didn’t try again the rest of that year. Then this last year she made 6 unsuccessful attempts. Each time she saw the negative result her stomach dropped and heart ached. By the end she resigned herself to one final shot - her birthday.<br/>Somehow all the stars aligned. The day landed within her fertile window, Ralph was able to come into town the day before, there was even a full blood moon! She knew Wanda would look to that as an affirmation from the universe that this was the time.</p>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha lay there in her queen sized bed cradled in a cocoon of comforters and pillows. Dawn was just beginning to glow on the horizon as she felt a soft thud at the end of her bed followed by the tiny approaching footsteps of Mr. Scratchy, her cat. She peered down and wiggled her fingers inviting him to come and settle on her chest. His little, pointed feet pressed down on her as he made biscuits before settling in with a nice hum of a purr. As she began to scratch him in his favorite spots the tight anxious knot in her chest began to melt away. He always knew when she was beginning to spiral and would come and comfort her. He also knew she happened to be awake which meant he would be fed soon; sooner if he could make himself a nuisance.<br/>She took a deep breath and stretched her arms out of the covers with a groan.<br/>“Fine mister, breakfast is on its way.” she told him as she sat up and flung the covers to the side. She slid on a pair of sweats and headed to the kitchen. She prepared his food and started brewing herself a cup of coffee. Though she wished she could sleep longer she did love this time in the morning. Everything was quiet, the world was just waking up and she could feel a sense of peace. She sat with the warm mug facing the floor to ceiling windows of her living room. From here she could look out across the city below her and see it slowly start to wake up with her.<br/>By 9:30 Ralph had woken and joined her in the living room.</p><p>“I didn’t expect to see you until noon - what time did you end up getting in last night?”<br/>“Ugh, I ended up with a 2 hour delay so I didn’t get here until almost one. But today is a big day! I wasn’t going to sleep it away! Have you eaten yet?”<br/>“No, not at all. Just starting to get hungry.”<br/>“Perfect! Go get dressed, we're going out to brunch. I think I might die if I don’t have a mimosa in my hand within the hour.”<br/>“Give me 20 mins and we can go.”</p><p>They headed out to a local brunch spot. As they went inside a familiar face greeted them.<br/>“Happy Birthday, Agatha!” Jen squealed as she rushed to give her a hug.<br/>“Don’t remind me.” Agatha grumbled as she begrudgingly let Jen hug her.<br/>“Oh, girl, I thought you were over that. We’ve had a blast these last few years.”<br/>“Good to hear, I don’t remember the last few birthdays thanks to you two. I cannot handle the hangover this year. I am officially too old.”<br/>“So what’s the plan for today?” asked Ralph<br/>“Well I’d like to go to the bookstore, I have a sweater to return, and I have to have dinner with my mother at 6.” Jen and Ralph simultaneously gasped.<br/>“You’re kidding!” Said Ralph “You’re seeing her on your birthday? Do you need some backup?”<br/>“No, I’ll be fine. She says she has something for me. Can’t imagine what it could be so I agreed to meet her. I also didn’t realize she meant today when she asked but I’d rather just get it over with than fight her about it.”<br/>“You are better than me, I can’t stand that woman.” Jen shuttered.<br/>“At least I have an excuse to leave by 7. Are we still picking you up on the way to the bar?”<br/>“No, I'll have to meet you there. I have a last minute staffing meeting for next week.” Jen said. “But here, I did want to give you your gift now” She handed Agatha a small gift bag. She pulled out 3 items and slowly unwrapped them. The first one was an amber and musk scented fragrance oil that smelled intoxicating, a set of lip sticks, and a vibrator.<br/>“Jen, wtf?!”<br/>“It has been 7 years Agatha, you need to get back out there and get laid. I do not know how you’ve managed this long.”<br/>“Who's to say it’s been 7 years, I could have had a few one night stands here and there”<br/>“But you haven't, right?”Jen said with a smirk.<br/>“Oh don’t be so self-satisfied. I’m doing just fine in that department.” Jen and Ralph exchanged looks.<br/>“Enough about me, what have you been up to, Jen?”<br/>“Well I’m supposed to go out of town next week but we’re two nurses down during busy season hence the impending meeting.”<br/>“How do babies have a busy season?” Ralph asked<br/>“This time of year we’re getting all the New Years and Valentines babies. Very busy and very unpredictable. Next week we could see anywhere from 10-40 babies born.”<br/>“Horrifying! I can barely imagine even one child.” Ralph said pointedly, eyeing Agatha.<br/>“What about you Ralph? Have you met anyone lately?” Agatha said.<br/>“Ugh, not to say it’s dismal, but this last contract left much to be desired. Too much drama, even for me, which is saying something!” They continued to delve into Ralph’s sordid details as they finished brunch. They all parted ways and Agatha wandered to the nearby bookstore.</p><p> </p><p>She loved the shops on mainstreet. All the buildings were over 100 years old which made her feel as if she was stepping back in time. She loved to imagine another life she may have lived generations ago, popping into the bakery and butcher shops to do her weekly shopping with a basket. She came upon her favorite shop at the end of the block. It was on the corner made of brick with large display windows. Old scripted letters were etched into the glass displaying the name, Literary Curiosities. As she pushed the wooden door open a bell chimed above her. The smell as she entered the bookshop brought her warmth and calmness. As she made her way through the shop the floor creaked beneath her feet. She took her time browsing the new arrivals, and staff pics. Eventually she made her way up the narrow wooden staircase in the back.<br/>In the far corner of the small second floor was their selection of poetry. She had many, if not, most all of the few books they had, but would often check to see the new additions. Nothing on the shelves caught her eye this time and she began to make her way back down the stairs. As she turned into the doorway she collided with another person coming up the stairs. The person reached out to grab her as they nearly slipped off the top step. She shrieked as she quickly grabbed the frame of the doorway and prevented both of them from tumbling down the stairs. As her heart was still racing from the adrenaline she caught the woman’s eye, then her heart skipped a beat. A mix of chocolate, amber and honey, they were warm and inviting on the surface but had a burning intensity that made her stomach flutter. The only thing that outshone their splendor was her radiating smile. Agatha took a step back and the woman’s hands fell from around her shoulders. She tried to speak and found herself breathless and stuttering.<br/>“Sorry, that was completely my bad, I was going too fast up those stairs. I didn’t see you coming at all. You OK?”<br/>Further caught off guard by the woman’s ease and concern she felt panic rising in her chest. Embarrassed and feeling insecure she spat back at her, “You should watch where you’re going. Someone is going to get hurt.” She pushed past the woman, stumbling into her one last time as she rushed back down the stairs.</p><p> </p><p>She had made it a block before she realized she was practically running. She stopped suddenly leaning against a building taking deep breaths. What the fuck had just happened? Why had she turned into a bumbling idiot? She closed her eyes, trying to crush the memory and the feelings. It was just an awkward encounter with a stranger that she will never see again. It didn’t mean anything. But the woman’s face kept coming to mind. Those eyes, that silky dark hair, and she smelled… like fresh rain and earth with a hint of incense and honey. She opened her eyes and shook her head letting out a frustrated sigh. She took a deep breath and began to walk back to her car, telling herself she wouldn’t remember this in the morning.</p><p> </p><p>She quickly ran and returned the sweater and then rushed home to get ready for dinner with her mother. Her mother; a woman she definitely needed time to mentally prepare for. Evanora was a brilliant and ruthless woman. Co-Founder of the New Horizons Baptist Church, Evanora judged Agatha through the eyes of a wrathful God. Agatha was required to excel academically, maintain a rigorous extracurricular schedule, as well as manage the home chores and church youth community. Her only saving grace at the time was Violet. They had grown up as practically sisters, her family being among the first congregation. They were close and would share their hopes and fears. As they entered high school they were nearly inseparable, and the likely choice to lead the summer youth church camping expedition.<br/>The 3 night backpacking adventure was a test of their survival skills and intended to bring them closer to God in their suffering. 12 in total they were paired off with limited supplies and each other. They led the pack through mountainous trails, stopping each night to make camp. On the last night as everyone else trailed off to bed she and Violet sat around the fire, telling each other stories and gossiping about the church elders. As the night thickened and the air got cooler they moved closer, sharing each other's warmth. Eventually she found Violet’s arm wrapped around her shoulders, their heads leaning against one another as they stared up at the stars.<br/>“I don’t think I’ve ever known or loved anyone as I have loved you.” She remembered Violet whispering into her ear. Agatha stared into her emerald green eyes as they flickered in the firelight. Their faces inching closer with every breath. Before she realized it she had closed the distance between them, her lips now pressing against Violet’s. They stayed connected for a moment until they heard the snap of a branch behind them.</p><p>“What are you doing?” came the panicked voice of another camper. The girls quickly separated creating a large distance between them.<br/>“Nothing” muttered Violet. Agatha was too stunned to speak.<br/>“You two are heathens, wait until the elders hear about this.”<br/>“Please…please don’t tell my mother.” Begged Agatha<br/>“And now you’re tempting me to lie? I’ve always known you were wicked. I will not let your immorality corrupt me. Prepare to face the consequences of your actions.”</p><p> </p><p>From that moment on she never said another word to Violet. Upon their return Agatha planned to talk with her mother but she never got that chance. The other girl had immediately cornered Evanora and the pastor who were now glaring at both the girls. Evanora stormed over and grabbed Agatha by the arm pulling her away toward the car. As soon as both the doors were shut Evanora began her tirade.<br/>“I should have known from the very beginning. You and that girl were always entirely too close. I’ve sensed this wickedness in you from the beginning and I prayed that God would have taken you at birth rather than have you cursed as such. I don’t know what I’ve done to have angered him so to give me you as a daughter. The shame you have brought upon me, upon yourself, and upon this church. I cannot allow you to return until these maladies are driven from your spirit.”<br/>“Mother, what are you saying?” Agatha cried out as tears began to form<br/>“You are going away.”<br/>“Where? For how long?”<br/>“I’m sending you to a camp that specializes in eradicating this wickedness. When you’ve completed the program you will finish out your schooling at Massachusetts Reformatory for Girls.”<br/>“Boarding School? You mean I won’t graduate with my friends?”<br/>“My dear, you’ll be lucky to graduate at all! If you think my expectations have been unreasonable, this convent will surpass your wildest expectations.”</p><p>Agatha managed to survive her final years in the most oppressive boarding school at the top of her class. She applied on her own to New Jersey State, intentionally selecting a state school as she knew this would anger her mother the most. From there she was entirely on her own, free to finally explore herself and her sexuality. When she eventually met and married Wanda, Evanora declared the daughter she had was dead, declining to ever meet the woman, which was for the best. Agatha had done all she could to write the woman off and this gave them a clear break. Eventually Evanora got word of Wanda’s disappearance and sent Agatha a congratulatory card claiming God was giving her a second chance to redeem herself, now was the time to come back to the church. This, Agatha ignored, throwing the card out immediately. On and off since, Agatha would get congregants visiting her door, offering to take her to church. If they were lucky she would ignore them. If not, they would get the brunt of the anger and resentment she still held for her mother.</p><p> </p><p>Then, a month ago, she got a text message from an unknown number:<br/>Agatha, this is your mother. I need to see you, I have something for you. This is important, do not ignore me.<br/>Her mother didn’t text. She didn’t realize she even had a phone, let alone Agatha’s number, but she wasn’t surprised. Evanora had always kept tabs on Agatha’s life somehow. She didn’t respond. A week later she received another text.<br/>Agatha, are you seeing this message? It is important that we get together soon. Call me at this number.<br/>Again, Agatha ignored the message. She had nothing to say to her mother and nothing she could think of that her mother would offer her. Then finally a week ago she got a voice message.<br/>“Agatha, this is your mother. I now know this is the correct number! I need to see you dear, it’s about your grandfather, he’s left something for you and I know you’ll regret it if you ignore this. Call me back when you get this.” She stood in her kitchen stunned. She hadn’t heard her mother’s voice in nearly a decade. She hadn’t known her grandfather had passed or when, though given his age she wasn’t surprised. They had always shared a special connection as he was the only person who showed her any true form of love and kindness. If it was truly on her grandfather’s behalf that was different and she owed it to herself to see this out.<br/>It still took her two days before she shakily redialed her mother’s number, a glass of wine in hand.<br/>Ring…ring…ri “Hello, Dear! I’m surprised I’m finally hearing from you. How have you been?”<br/>“What do you have for me?”<br/>“Ah straight to the point, I see. Well, you know your grandfather passed and he’s left me a few items to give to you and some documents to oversee. I’d love to meet on Friday to go over everything. I’ve made reservations at 6 for us at La Fete de Nuit. You still live in Westview, dear?”<br/>“Yes, mother.” She sighed “Fine I’ll see you at 6” She hung up the phone then chugged the glass of wine. Better to get this over with than draw out what was likely to be a disastrous encounter. Only when Ralph was confirming birthday plans the next morning did she realize she agreed to meet with her mother on her birthday.</p><p> </p><p>As she was getting ready the day of, did she realize she wasn’t going to be changing after dinner before the drag show and would just have to wear her birthday outfit to dinner. She had picked out a lavender cowl neck dress with spaghetti straps that flowed down just above her knees. The top was fitted but draped around her chest. She wore a silver charm around her neck that featured the 3 graces and dark plum strappy heels. Her hair was long, down around her waist, and tousled in beachy waves. She finished her makeup off with a dark plum lipstick from Jen’s gift. She opened the amber oil and took a whiff, it was sweet and musky with a hint of spice. Definitely something she wouldn’t have picked out on her own but as she put it on, realized it really suited her.<br/>She looked at the clock, 5:45, shit she was going to be late. She quickly grabbed her long navy trench coat and her purse and headed out the door. She drove in silence as she armoured herself for the stress she was about to undergo. She pulled into the parking lot and as she turned off the engine took a deep breath.<br/>In and out, rip it off like a bandaid. She told herself. It’ll be over before you know it. She swung her car door open and headed inside. She walked up to the host stand, “2 under Harkness I believe?” She glanced around the restaurant checking to see if she could catch sight of her mother before Evanora found her. As she caught sight of her mother at a far table she could hear the hostess say,<br/>“I have a Harkness for 4 right this way.” 4? Who else would she have dragged to this dinner. She regretted ever agreeing to this, it was obviously some sort of trap. For what, she wasn’t entirely sure yet, and to use her grandfather’s death as a ploy to see her?! She could feel the fury building inside her as they approached the table. She could now see a man and another woman sitting with her mother.</p><p>“And here she is my dear daughter, Agatha, so good to see you dear!” Her mother rose from the table reaching out to surround her in a limp embrace. What the fuck was happening? She expected her mother to behave as if they were on good terms, but now with the others in attendance she could tell this was going to be a show. She looked at the woman who appeared to be around the same age as her mother. Her grey hair pulled back in a severe french twist, her lips pursed in a crude half smile. The man seemed to be younger, closer to her age. He was in a navy suit with a red tie and had the face of a man who bought crypto and drove a cybertruck.</p><p>“Mother, who are these people?” She muttered through a cringed smile.<br/>“This, dear, is Christian and his dear mother Janice. Christian has been helping us sort through your grandfather’s affairs. Sit down dear we were just about to order.” Christian, because of course his name was Christian, stood up and pulled the seat out for her. She strained every muscle in her face not to roll her eyes at the gesture and instead shared a half smile. She hadn’t looked at the menu but knew she didn’t need to, her mother had a terrible habit of ordering on her behalf. It didn’t matter though, she was planning to eat and debrief with Ralph afterward.</p><p>“So Agatha, your mother tells us you now work with the symphony?” Janice inquired, trying to strike up conversation.<br/>“Yes and no. I support their marketing team and am a donor engagement coordinator for Music Hall. I manage a lot of independent events and fundraisers.”<br/>“Oh that sounds exciting. And they pay you to do that?” Janice followed up. Agatha, once again restraining the rage inside her, checked her watch. 6:10. Honestly a record for how quickly dinner with her mother could derail.<br/>“Yes ma’am. I have a whole salary with benefits and everything.” She said with as much sincerity as she could muster.<br/>“Oh, that must make it difficult to find a man and settle down. I’ve heard you’ve not had good luck in that department.” Wow the sheer audacity of this woman. But somehow, knowing Evanora, this wasn’t entirely a surprise. This is what she had dragged her into. She reached for a wine glass that wasn’t there, of course there was no wine. She, instead, grabbed the glass of water and took a few gulps.<br/>“Oh, I’ve had my ups and downs there. MOTHER, you mentioned items from grandad? Can you tell me about that now please?” Desperately trying to move the conversation in any other direction.<br/>“Oh yes dear, your grandfather, rest his soul, has recognized you in his will.” She gestured at Christian to take over the details.<br/>“Your grandfather has left you the estate in Boston, including all items found within.” She sat frozen, staring questioningly at her mother.<br/>“Why me? Why not you?”<br/>“If I could only ask your grandfather that very question! In his infinite wisdom he left everything to you.”<br/>“I don’t know that I even want that!” She exclaimed<br/>“Don’t be so insolent!” She snapped “You should be grateful!” She glared at her mother before turning to Christian.<br/>“What happens if I don’t accept?”<br/>“He has instructed all items, including the house, to go to auction should you be unable or unwilling to inherit.”<br/>“So you get nothing either way.” She directed to Evanora. She could see the anger and resentment filling her mother’s face.<br/>“Despite the care I provided that man throughout his life he has tossed me aside in favor of you. However undeserving, and ungrateful you may be.” Glaring at her mother she began to rise from the table, deciding it better to walk away than encourage this behavior further.<br/>“Agatha, sit!” Her mother commanded. As a reflex she returned to her seat silently. “Whether you accept the property or not we cannot finalize your grandfather’s estate without executing these documents and since you are still living you are required for that.” Christian opened a manilla folder he had brought, handing over a series of documents to Agatha.<br/>“I don’t have time to read through all of this tonight and I’m not signing anything I haven’t fully read.”<br/>“You are more than welcome to take them with you; however, you should be aware there is a 30 day window from receiving these documents in which the parties must accept or decline and sign, otherwise you automatically forfeit any rights to the inheritance. My, uh, my phone number is on the front when you’re ready to return everything, give me a call.” Christian said with a wink. Agatha swallowed to keep herself from vomiting.<br/>“Is that all?” Agatha questioned her mother<br/>“Well dear, it has been quite some time since we’ve seen each other, thought you might like to catch up.”<br/>“You seem to be all caught up on my life already. Besides, I’ve made plans that I can’t be late for.”<br/>“You’ve made other arrangements? Tonight after agreeing to meet with me?”<br/>“Mother, I’ve had these plans long before I agreed to meet with you. In fact, I adjusted my original plans to accommodate this given your texting and calling. I have the documents and I will have my lawyer reach out to Christian. Again, I hope you all have a lovely evening, goodnight” and with that she snatched her things from the table and left.</p><p> </p><p>“YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!” Ralph shouted out the doorway of the hall bathroom. “That woman is a piece of work. What did she think was going to happen?”<br/>“She was so nonchalant! And of course she had to bring those people. I do think she was trying to set me up with Christian. Gods, never in a million years.”<br/>“So you’re like super rich now though, right?”<br/>“No, I’ve not agreed to anything yet. Honestly it all just seems like a headache. I’m not moving to Boston, my life is here. Ugh, I just don’t really want to think about this tonight. Right now I just want to pretend nothing happened and start the night. Where’s my drink?”<br/>“I thought you said you were cutting back this year?” Ralph said with a smirk.<br/>“After that?! I’m not staying completely sober. Just a little to take the edge off.”<br/>“I’m messing with you. I’d be under the table by now if it were me. Here, I think it’s a Pino?” He handed her a glass with red wine and she took a large gulp. She finished the glass as Ralph puts the finishing touches on his drag persona, Lady Bohner, and called a Lyft.</p><p>“You still want to leave a little early tonight? If you’re not feeling up to it after today I get it”<br/>“Oh we’re doing this tonight. Too many things are already in place. It’s now or never.”<br/>“Alright, I’ll come find you after the show and we’ll head out. You still haven’t said anything to Jen?”<br/>“No, she’s got enough going on. I’ve been able to handle things so far. If all goes well she’ll know soon enough. And if not, she never needed to worry, I don’t need her pity.”<br/>They pull up to the bar and quickly hop out of the vehicle. “Jen said she’s running late so we’ll meet her inside.” They made their way inside and headed towards a table near the stage.<br/>“You ok to stay here for a bit while I get set up? I’ll make sure you get a drink.”<br/>“Yeah of course, and I’ll grab something myself. See you in a bit.”</p><p>She put her coat down at the table and headed to the bar. Already a bit crowded, she found a space at the end and waited on the bartender. Glancing around at the other patrons she caught sight of a woman at the other end of the bar transfixed on her. Her large doe eyes pierced into her. She quickly glanced away feeling a flush rising in her cheeks. The woman looked familiar but she couldn’t quite place her. She bounced her gaze around the room, taking time before resting upon the woman again. Her stare had not weakened and a smirk was now resting on her lips. She didn’t know how long she stood there mesmerized when the bartender finally gathered her attention.<br/>“Vodka soda with a splash of cranberry” She barked. She reached into her wallet pulling out cash. She slapped it on the bar harder than she intended and grabbed the drink. She looked back to spot the woman again but she had gone and Agatha could not find her in the thickening crowd around her. She elbowed her way back to the table, keeping a lookout as she went. Just as she put her drink down she felt hands grab her shoulders. Startled, she whipped around nearly smacking Jen before she realized who it was.</p><p>“Woah, Agatha, watch it! It’s just me!”<br/>“Oh my GODS Jen! Don’t do that. I almost flattened you.”<br/>“OOO, what’s got you so jumpy you knew I was coming.”<br/>“Yes, but you didn’t have to sneak up on me like that.”<br/>“My bad! So how was dinner?”<br/>“Ugh, worse than you can imagine. I’m pretty sure she tried to set me up with a republican.”<br/>“Oh NO! You’re kidding - not a man?!”<br/>“That’s just the beginning. But I don’t want to talk about that tonight! I just want to have a good time at this show and go home at a reasonable time.”<br/>“Wow you really are getting older.”<br/>“The fact that I’m here at all is a miracle.” She took a sip of her drink and glanced across the runway stage to see two amber honey doe eyes glowing back at her. She sputtered, choking on her drink.<br/>“You good, Agatha?” Jen chuckled.<br/>“Yep, just down the wrong pipe” She choked back. She felt the warmth rising again in her chest and face, a mix of embarrassment and shock.<br/>They settled in and waited for the show to begin. Agatha attempted to participate in small talk, as Jen babbled about the stressful week she had, but was too aware of the woman across the aisle sizing her up. What was this woman’s problem? Finally the lights dimmed and the thundering base of the intro began to play. Ralph’s voice echoed over the speakers.</p><p>“And now, shes, hes, theys and gays, welcome to the stage, your host, Lady BOHNER!!” Ralph walked out in her signature look, a shimmering ball gown and the biggest blonde wig you’ve ever seen. The night was eventful, practically every queen was doing the most, particularly at Agatha’s table. Despite the attention, her mind couldn’t help wandering back to the woman transfixed on her. She figured out about halfway through that Ralph had told them about the event they were celebrating. Before the final set she, along with other people celebrating events that evening, was pulled on stage to take a shot. As Lady Bohner handed her the shot she grumbled to him, “This better not be tequila.” He winked and then shouted to the crowd. “Alright homos! Raise your glasses and down the hatch!” She choked down the tequila and made her way back down to her seat; not before noticing the woman who had been watching her raise her glass once again to Agatha and take a drink with a wink. Her skin prickled with goosebumps as her stomach began to flutter once again.</p><p>As the final queens left the stage Agatha took a glance back across the room. The woman who had stolen her attention the whole show was nowhere to be found. She found herself relieved that whatever spell this woman had her under was broken, yet there was a twinge of disappointment as the tension immediately dissipated.<br/>“I have to go to the bathroom, I'll be right back” She said as she made her way past Jen. Bumping her way through, she made it to the restroom before a line had started to form. As she rushed to push the door open she heard a smack and a grunt on the other side. Fuck, she slowly moved the door open.<br/>“I’m so sorry I was rushing I didn’t think anyone was in here!” She was stopped in her tracks, standing before her, rubbing her face was the woman. Of course it was her!<br/>“You should watch where you’re going” She said with a smirk “Someone could get hurt” And then with one of those big doe eyes she winked at Agatha. Her heart fluttered, warmth rose quickly in her chest. “Funny running into you again. Must be my lucky day.” At that moment she realized it was the same woman from the bookstore! The woman’s voice was low and warm, each word tinged with seductive sarcasm.<br/>“S…sure. Mine too I guess.” She chuckled with anxiety. The woman slowly walked toward her, closing the space between them, stopping just short of their noses meeting. She stood there for a moment tearing Agatha apart with her gaze before she finally said,<br/>“Well, I’m gonna head out, maybe I’ll catch you out there.” As the door closed behind her Agatha let out a breath she didn’t know she was holding. The air around her was filled with the woman’s fragrance. She was brought back to earlier that day in the bookstore; the way her heart raced. She caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror. Mouth agape, face flushed, hair somehow tousled. She finally gathered herself enough to actually use the restroom then summoned up the courage to return to Jen. She took a glance around the room as she exited, not finding the woman among the crowd and continued back towards the table.</p><p>“You good?” Jen said as she approached, a look of concern on her face.<br/>“I’m fine, I think, I just want to get out of here. Is Ralph ready?”<br/>“Not yet, should be out soon though. We headed back to yours?”<br/>“Um, well, Ralph and I will head back. I’ve got to be up early tomorrow so I think I’m just gonna call it a night.”<br/>“Oh, ok, if you're sure. Don’t want to walk and get a cookie or anything first?”<br/>“No, I’m not feeling well and today was a lot. But we’ll catch up next week alright?”<br/>“Sure, Agatha, have a good night.” Jen walked off toward the bar to grab another drink. Agatha turned back to grab her things and took a seat as she impatiently for Ralph.<br/>“This seat taken?” Said a sultry voice. She glanced up once again to see the woman had cornered her at last.<br/>“Be my guest.” She said with a wave of her hand.<br/>“I was going to ask you to dance but you seem more like you could use another drink.”<br/>“Thank you for the offer but as soon as my friend arrives we’re headed out.”<br/>“Oh what a pity, guess my luck is running out. Any chance you have time for one song?” She stood up and offered her hand to Agatha. Agatha took a moment to consider, looking back and forth between the woman’s hand and her enchanting smile. It was her birthday, and likely the last chance she would get to let loose and experience this kind of spontaneity. And this woman, who had captivated her from the moment they first ran into each other was hard to deny.<br/>“Fine…just one song.” She placed her hand into the woman’s who led her into the crowd of people dancing. The DJ was playing a mix of ABBA and house music. The woman spun her around and then pulled her in tight. They started bouncing along to the music and singing along to the lyrics. She had to admit ABBA was one of her favorites. She could feel a smile slowly creeping across her face and the bass pounded through her chest. She felt the woman’s arms holding her closely around her waist. The woman was dancing in unrestrained joy, flirting as she sang along. Agatha could feel her walls beginning to crumble around her and anxiety melting away. She felt… happy. As the mix was nearing the end she found her arms wrapped around the woman’s shoulders, their faces almost touching. Smiling, she let out a deep sigh and happened to glance behind the woman. She caught sight of Ralph waving at her with a shit eating grin on his face.</p><p>“I have to go.” She said breathlessly and started to push past the woman.<br/>“Midnight already Cinderella?” She heard the woman call after her. She didn’t turn around, now seeing Ralph, she could feel embarrassment flushing her cheeks. She did not want to explain whatever just happened to Ralph. What even did just happen?<br/>“Ready to go?” She huffed as she approached<br/>“Are you ready? Looked like you were having a good time with…?”<br/>“Who knows?” She said with a shrug and then clapped her hands together. “Let’s go” She rushed to put on her coat, Ralph handed her her purse and she aggressively elbowed her way through the crowd.</p><p>As soon as she made it out the door she could feel the cool air on her face focusing her back to reality. She quickly ordered a car which arrived as Ralph finally made it out of the club. Before he could ask another question she was inside and seated. They had a nearly silent journey back until Ralph dared to speak.</p><p>“Looked like you had fun tonight” He said with a smirk. She gave him a sideways glance and returned to looking out the window before finally responding, “yes”<br/>“I don’t remember the last time I saw you that happy honestly. Not since..”<br/>“Don’t say it.” She cut him off “not tonight, please.”<br/>“Agatha, you deserve to be happy. Don’t close yourself off to it.” He always knew how to read her and tell her exactly what she needed to hear even if she didn’t want to hear it.<br/>“I am happy. Tonight was nice, now let’s end it on a good note.”<br/>“Are you sure?”<br/>“How many times are you going to ask me that?” She finally turned to look at him fully.<br/>“You’re right. Just trying to look out for you, I do care about you, Agatha.”<br/>“I know” she muttered, turning back to the window as they pulled up to her place. She took a moment in the car as she heard Ralph get out. He came around to her side and opened the door, offering his hand.<br/>“Come on, you still have a present from me.”<br/>“Ew” she said as she took his hand.<br/>“That too, but this is something you get to unwrap. Come on” he said with a chuckle. He wrapped his arm around her shoulder and they walked inside.</p><p> </p><p>As soon as they entered Ralph made his way to the guest bedroom and Agatha peeled off her coat and shoes to then make her way to the couch. She sat there for a moment, flashes of the day cycling through her mind as she tried to decompress and refocus herself for the task ahead. She closed her eyes and let herself think of Wanda, the memories fuzzier than she anticipated. Their last night together, as they held each other close. Wanda’s head on her chest while she laid a hand on Agatha’s barely pregnant belly. She hadn’t really even begun to show. She remembered the softness as she combed her fingers through Wanda’s fiery scarlet hair, the smell of vanilla and sandalwood. As she tried to deepen the memory, searching for every detail, it began to morph. Wanda’s hair slowly darkened and she turned to sit up looking down at Agatha with deep honey amber eyes. A smirk forming on not Wanda’s face. The smell of fresh rain and earth mixing with the sandalwood. The woman now moved to straddle her, taking off her shirt in the process and revealing a dark lace bra. She put her hands on the couch on either side of Agatha, slowly bringing her face down coming in for a kiss.</p><p>“Alright my dear” suddenly she was jerked from this not memory by Ralph storming into the living room. She sat up quickly, a little flustered. Ralph plopped onto the couch, in his hands two wrapped presents.<br/>“You really didn’t have to get me anything.” She said sheepishly<br/>“Like I wouldn’t, go ahead and open the small one first.” She took hold of the first present unwrapping it slowly to reveal a jewelry box. She cracked open the shell to show a sparkling moon and stars bracelet.<br/>“Oh my gods, Ralph, this is gorgeous. You really didn’t have to.”<br/>“I know but it made me think of you and seemed like a good omen for tonight, with the moon and everything. Seemed like something Wanda would have given you.” She gave him a small smile, her eyes beginning to fill with a tear she wouldn’t let fall.<br/>“Thank you” she said warmly. She reached for the second gift which was a bit longer but not much bigger. She unwrapped it to reveal a box with the word Mosie on it. She looked back at Ralph, a little perplexed, and opened the box to reveal what looked like a syringe of some sort.<br/>“You can dig into this in a minute but it’s for tonight. My ex, well one of them, helped his lesbian bestie and her wife have their children. He said they had tried other products without much luck but as soon as they used this they got pregnant and now they have twins. Thought it might help.” She looked back up at Ralph, now unable to hold the tears back she lurched forward to capture him in a hug.<br/>“I don’t know what I would do without you. Thank you, this is so unexpected but really appreciated.”<br/>“Not to break this rare and tender moment but damn you smell good. What is that?”<br/>“Oh it’s that oil Jen got me, ember or amber I think?”<br/>“Whatever it is is working for you, that is intoxicating.” She blushed and then thought back to the night. Was that why she seemed so drawn to her? Had Jen’s perfume helped to ensnare that woman. If so the feeling was mutual as the woman’s scent also filled her memory. She stood up grabbing the items and began to head to her room.<br/>“I’m going to get settled. Text me when you’re done and in bed. I don’t want to run into you after, like last time.” She chuckled.<br/>“You got it babe! Love you, see you in the morning, mamas” he blew her a kiss.</p><p>As she made her way into the room she unzipped her dress and let it fall around her feet. Stepping out she crawled into bed, set her phone on the night stand beside her, and opened the smutty romance novel she had been reading. She knew there was a better chance to success if she could get herself off and the book definitely would help. But nothing could replace the feeling of Wanda’s hands and mouth exploring her body. As she read she could feel the heat begin to rise in her core. Her mind conjuring images of the characters succumbing to their base desires. Her hands began to wander down her own body as she moved the book to the side. Her eyes closing gently to feel the intensity of her touch more clearly. She was surprisingly gentle, teasing herself as her wetness grew. She began to delve into her memory of her encounters with Wanda, particularly the night they first conceived. Soft kisses caressing her body. Warm hands lighting the fire within her, all drawing down to her core. She pressed her own fingers slowly inside her at the memory. Then again it began to morphe. Wanda, no not Wanda, sat up. Honey amber eyes and a devilish smile looking back at her. Her heart quickened at the thought. She let her mind continue to wander. The image of the woman, now naked, began to climb her body. Hands and nails scraping down her legs from her knees to her hips where her hands wrapped around her legs. The woman’s gaze never leaving Agatha’s mind. Her face lowering to Agatha’s core, she could practically feel her hot breath dancing against her clit. Agatha with her other hand now grabbed her breast, teasing her own nipple. She slid another finger inside herself. She imagined the woman’s strong commanding hands filling her body as she teased with little bites and kisses. She could feel the pull quickly growing in her core nearing release when BUZZ BUZZ BUZZ from her phone broke her out of this fantasy.<br/>Startled out of the moment she scrambled for the phone.</p><p>RALPH: All set hon! Best of luck, you got this!</p><p>Damn he had terrible timing! She huffed and lay there for a moment. Finally she got up and put on some clothes and made her way down to the guest bathroom. She opened the door to find the lights off with every candle in the room lit. She rolled her eyes, flipped on the lights and began blowing out the candles. She picked up the cup he had left and grabbed the Mosie box to return to her room. She quickly completed the task and collapsed back on her bed with feet up on the headboard. She pondered the tapestry hanging above her bed, the moon cycle with constellations surrounding. This brought back thoughts of Wanda as she imagined resting her head in her lap. Wanda softly humming a folk tune as she played with Agatha’s hair. She gently closed her eyes and pictured Wanda’s hands making their way down her body as soft kisses fluttered down her neck. She could feel the arousal once again growing in her core. As her hands began to wander with the images she was conjuring, they again began to change. The soft scarlet hair growing to a dark ebony, her soft blue green eyes darkening and growing wide. The playful smirk returned to the woman’s face and the hands grabbing her body became aggressively passionate. The fire burning inside her now radiating up through her chest, her nipples erect with arousal. Though her fingers managed well on their own, assisted by her imagination, the intensity inside her required something more. She reached into her bedside table for her wand. The added pressure and leverage would get her over the edge. She turned on the device and settled back into her fantasy. The woman, in her mind, was insatiable, biting and kissing her most sensitive spots. At this point her legs were shaking in anticipation before she finally felt the release within washing over her from head to toe. She lay there for a moment, hot and sweaty, catching her breath. What spell had that woman put on her?</p>

<p>Chapter Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Agatha ponders her inheritance, meets up with Jen to hear some news, takes the pregnancy test.</p></blockquote>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>A few weeks later, Ralph was onto his next excursion, Agatha was doing all that she could to keep busy. She had passed the traditional two week wait and was yet to take a pregnancy test. She didn’t feel any different, no morning sickness, a little tired but she also didn’t stop moving. It was still early and she didn’t want to disappoint herself unnecessarily so she focused on anything else. Between benefits and fundraisers at work and her mother badgering her about her grandfather’s inheritance she had plenty to keep her occupied.<br/>
She’d already met with her lawyer a few times to go over the fine details but was yet to sign and return the documents. She didn’t really care about the estate, it seemed like more of a burden to manage, but it was the most she had of her childhood and her past, the few good parts that did exist. The home itself held a treasure trove of antiques he had collected over the years. She had just under a week to decide yet she wasn’t in a hurry as she knew it would likely mean more interactions with her mother.</p><p>Today she had her first break in the chaos and had planned a day of reading and relaxation, centering herself and avoiding her growing list of responsibilities. This was not long lived as she got an early call from Jen. Several, in fact, which she tried to ignore until the third call.</p><p>“Somebody better be dying” she grunted into the phone<br/>
“Jeeze, Agatha, hello to you too” Jen scoffed<br/>
“You keep calling so it must be urgent”<br/>
“I’ve been trying to get a hold of you for weeks! I figured at this point you were either dead or your mother got to you, or both. Now that I know you’re still breathing, do you want to get brunch?” Agatha glanced at the clock. She’d been awake for 4 hours and hadn’t thought to eat or drink anything. Suddenly she realized how hungry she actually was.<br/>
“You buying?” Jen let out a sigh<br/>
“Sure, if that’ll get you there. 30 mins?”<br/>
“Give me an hour, I still have to pull myself together.”<br/>
“It’s 10 a.m., on a Wednesday. How have you not gotten ready yet?”<br/>
“I wasn’t planning on leaving my house today - that can still be the plan if you want to push it.”<br/>
“No, no, that’s fine. See you in an hour”</p><p>Agatha took her time, only showing up 15 mins later than she had told Jen, who frantically waved her over.<br/>
“Finally! Girl, you look like death warmed over. You sure your mother didn’t suck the soul out of you?”<br/>
“No, I’ve been able to avoid her so far. I’m just exhausted. I feel like I haven’t stopped moving since I last saw you. Also I’ve had a headache on and off for like the last week.”<br/>
“Have you been drinking enough water?” Jen questioned<br/>
“Have you been drinking enough water?” Agatha mocked back. Jen glared at her.<br/>
“YES. I’m staying hydrated.” She grabbed the glass of water next to her and chugged it.<br/>
“See” she said with a gasp<br/>
“Cute. I bet you feel amazing now”<br/>
“Never better” she said through a burp “So what’s going on?”<br/>
“I met someone.” Jen said as a smile grew across her face.<br/>
“Oh boy. Hope this isn’t another Madison situation.”<br/>
“Don’t go there. She is nothing like Madison. She is wonderful, and kind, and a little broody but in a super hot way. The sex is amazing.”<br/>
“Wow, sounds like you’re really taking your time with this one.” Agatha said with an eye roll “so where and when did you meet her?”<br/>
“That night at the bar. Turns out she actually owns the place and owns a townhouse a block over. ”<br/>
“Don’t tell me you’re moving in with her or something.”<br/>
“No! We’ve gone on a few dates and things are going well. Really well, but the U-Haul has not been packed yet. I’d love for you to meet her.”<br/>
“You’re really willing to risk that? You must really like this woman.”<br/>
“Well it seems whether I like it or not I’m stuck with you. Besides, she’s tough. I think she can hold her own, even against you.”<br/>
“Does she have a name?”<br/>
“Alice”<br/>
“Alice”<br/>
“So you’ll have dinner with us?”<br/>
“Dinner? What am I, your mother?”<br/>
“Agatha! Why do you have to be so difficult?”<br/>
“Fine! I’ll think about it. It’s not going to be anytime soon right?”<br/>
“You tell me when you’re free.”<br/>
“Good because I’ve got a lot going on. It likely won’t be soon.”<br/>
“Bullshit with Evanora?”<br/>
“Primarily. She hasn’t stopped bugging me about signing the forms.”<br/>
“Why haven’t you signed them?”<br/>
“Mostly because I know it will piss her off. But also I don’t know if I want to deal with any of it. The idea of it also gives me a headache.”<br/>
“So, you’d get his entire estate right?”<br/>
“It’s not as exciting as it sounds. He was a hoarder so the place is filled with stuff I would have to go through before I could even sell it. I don’t know if I’d have the time or energy.”<br/>
“You’d really sell it?”<br/>
“It’s in Boston! It’s also ancient and needs quite a bit of work. I’d never move there, though it would be nice to see the place.”<br/>
“Who knows what you could find. May give you some closure.”<br/>
“Perhaps. I’ll probably sign, but I’m waiting until the last minute. I can’t give my mother too much satisfaction. Honestly I need to change my number again, she’s becoming unbearable now that she knows how to contact me.”<br/>
“You know you can block her in your phone.”<br/>
“What?”<br/>
“You can make it so you don’t get any messages or calls from her.”<br/>
“Why didn’t you tell me this before?”<br/>
“It’s never come up before. Give me your phone.” Jen grabbed Agatha’s phone, quickly unlocking it. “You have to pick a better password than 123456. There you go. No more Evanora.”<br/>
“I knew I kept you around for something.” The women continued to chat through brunch, Jen mostly babbling about the goings on at the hospital as Agatha stuffed her face with every breakfast food. She really hadn’t realized how hungry she had gotten. By the end of the meal she was so stuffed she had to head back home and take a nap.</p><p>Agatha barely made it through her front door before she collapsed on her couch. Scratchy made his way onto her stomach where he made himself comfortable and they both quickly fell asleep. 3 hours later she awoke in a haze, arm numb from hanging off the side of the couch. Slowly, she sat up pushing Scratchy off her lap. She felt that flush nauseated feeling of having napped for too long. She gradually made her way to her feet, stumbling to her kitchen for a glass of water which she once again chugged. She shuffled down her hallway and into the guest bathroom. Flicking on the lights she caught the sight of herself in the mirror. Hair, a long tangled rats nest. Her makeup smeared across the one side of her face. Her clothes were crumpled on her body slightly clinging to her sweaty frame. I guess now is as good a time as any. She thought to herself. She opened the cabinet below her sink grabbing the box of pregnancy tests. Wearily she grabbed a test, using it as she relieved herself of the nearly 2 liters of water she had consumed at brunch. She placed it on the counter and made her way to her bedroom to change.<br/>
Eventually she made her way back out to the kitchen grabbing a few handfuls of nuts and she settled into the book she had tried to start that morning. Mr. Scratchy once again made himself comfortable on her lap and she lost herself in the pages of the novel. Over an hour had passed and once again she had to pee. She shuffled Scratchy off her lap and made her way back to the hall bathroom. She sat down quickly then happened to look over at the counter. Shit, she had managed to forget she had taken the test. From where she was sitting she couldn’t see the result. Good, she wasn’t quite ready. She finished and flushed the toilet standing to meet her gaze in the mirror. She took a deep breath and closed her eyes. It’s fine either way. She turned on the faucet and reached down to wash her hands, glancing over. Negative. She felt a slight twinge in her chest and took a hard swallow. Her stomach didn’t drop nearly as far as it had the last few times. She had resigned herself to this outcome after the last miscarriage. She didn’t think she could survive another one. Looking back in the mirror, her eyes beginning to mist, she smiled at herself. Letting out a big sigh she let the feeling of relief wash over her. It was done. This part of her life was over and in this moment she felt a sense of freedom, releasing something that was not meant to be. For a brief moment she allowed herself to grieve the life she had planned for.<br/>
She wiped away the tears that had fallen and threw away the test. With some sense of urgency she went to her work bag and pulled out the folder with the forms to her grandfather’s estate. She perused them one final time and signed them. She sent an email to her lawyer letting her know she’d drop off the forms tomorrow on the way to work. Before she closed her phone she noticed a text from Jen.<br/>
I’m assuming you made it home alright. Remember to let me know when you’re free to meet Alice.<br/>
She sighed. Knowing Jen, she wouldn’t let Agatha rest until they made plans. Since she pulled the trigger on the estate paperwork, might as well keep it up and solidify plans with Jen.</p><p>Yes I’m alive. We’ll do dinner in two weeks, on that Friday. I’m not making or bringing anything.</p><p>Jen must have been waiting by the phone since she got an instant reply.</p><p>Don’t worry we’ll go out! See you then!</p><p>She thought about reaching out to Ralph, letting him know it once again hadn’t worked, despite his best efforts. Though now he was somewhere in the Caribbean entertaining cruise guests. It wasn’t urgent and it wasn’t good news. It could wait until he returned in a couple months. For now she started mentally preparing herself to deal with the estate, and likely her mother. And Jen and her new girlfriend Alice. The thought of it, along with the board meetings, fundraisers, and benefits plaguing her time over the next few months suddenly made her nauseated. Having had enough for one day, that was supposed to have been relaxing, she grabbed her book and headed to bed.</p>

<p>
<span>Two weeks passed in the blink of an eye and before she knew it the dinner plans she had agreed to were upon her. Jen had been reminding her all week so by the time Friday rolled around she was already over it. Though she didn’t want to admit it she wasn’t feeling her best. Headaches off and on, particularly after a lengthy board meeting, and she hadn’t been able to eat much all day. She knew Jen would kill her if she canceled so she managed to head home and take a nap before getting ready for dinner. The nap didn’t help much, the headache was gone but her stomach was doing somersaults. She took a swig of pepto and started pulling herself together. She twisted her hair up into a loose bun and threw on a knee length skirt with a buttoned up sweater. She did her best to cover up the bags under her eyes and freshen up the rest of her makeup. BUZZ BUZZ a text from Jen</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>We’re headed to the restaurant now, see you there. Don’t be late! </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She rolled her eyes. Jen was lucky she was coming at all. She went and picked out a pair of boots and grabbed her long jacket before saying a quick goodbye to Scratchy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha made her way into the crowded restaurant, merely 10 mins late. She scanned the sea of people until she caught sight of Jen who was rushing up to get her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You really can’t be on time anywhere can you?” Jen said through a gritted smile</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well I’m here now. Let’s go get this over with, take me to her.” Jen scowled at Agatha before turning to lead her to their table. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As they approached the woman, who had to be Alice, stood up to greet her. She was in black dress pants with a white dress shirt and a matching waistcoat. Despite the dapper appearance her hair was shoulder length and shaggy with pops of burnt orange and red peeking out in places.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hi, you must be Agatha. So nice to finally meet you! Jen has told me so much about you. I’m Alice” Alice reached out her hand to which Agatha side eyed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Likewise.” Not shaking Alice’s hand she made her way into the booth. She scoured the menu, not acknowledging the women across from her. Alice exchanged a concerned look with Jen who brushed it off only to glare at Agatha. Thankfully this silence was broken by the waiter getting their drink order.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you want to split a bottle of wine?” Alice offered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No.” Agatha stated plainly before turning to the waiter. “I’ll take a vodka martini with a twist” She then returned to her menu, weighing her food decision. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We’ll each take a glass of the Rioja” Alice stated to the waiter pointing to her and Jen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And a charcuterie board for the table as soon as possible.” Added Jen again glaring at Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Right away” the waiter hurried back to the kitchen</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You that hungry Jen?” Agatha snorted, not glancing up from the menu. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, but clearly you need to eat something so you can stop being a complete bitch.” Agatha finally glanced up to stare daggers into Jen. She closed her menu as the drinks arrived, taking a sip before turning her attention to Alice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So, I hear you own a bar.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes.” Alice chuckled, more out of nervousness than amusement. “I’m pretty sure you’ve been there. At least that’s what Jen told me.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked, “oh yes, several times. What else has Jen told you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She did warn me you could be a bit temperamental but that appears to be a defense mechanism to avoid vulnerability and making genuine human connection.” Alice stated plainly. Jen let out a loud burst of a laugh as Agatha’s face fell. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re very… blunt” Agatha retorted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I told you she could hold her own.” Jen giggled as the charcuterie arrived. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you ready to place your order?” Asked the waiter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll take the greek salad with grilled chicken.” She handed the menu back without taking her eyes off Alice. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll do the seafood pasta” said Jen</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll do the halibut” stated Alice before returning both their menus to the waiter. Agatha leaned back in her chair crossing her arms. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So, do you moonlight as a therapist or something?” Agatha scoffed</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have a PhD in Psychology actually.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So the bar is a hobby or something?” Agatha questioned</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You could say that. Though I’d consider people more of a hobby.” Alice said with a smirk. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well aren’t you interesting? I’d say I’m pretty good at reading people myself. Though I’m more concerned with what’s in their bank account than their mind. They’re a lot easier to crack.” She said with a wink as she took another sip of her drink.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“For the love of God will you eat something so you stop being so insufferably smug.” Jen spat. Agatha grabbed the small bowl of cornichon from the charcuterie, sat back and started eating them like popcorn. She grinned at Jen, her mouth full of pickles. “I warned you” Jen said as she leaned over to Alice, taking a large gulp of her wine. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jen’s failed to mention much else about you other than your name and where you met. Do you see this as a serious relationship or are you just another one of Jen’s flings.” She could feel the heat from Jen’s eyes boring into her. Alice peered over at Jen before answering.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, I can’t speak for Jen, but I’m pretty serious about her. I’ve enjoyed every minute we’ve spent together so far and I hope to spend a lot more time with her, as long as she’ll have me.” Jen beamed back at Alice</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Cute” Agatha said sarcastically</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And what about you, are you seeing anyone?” Alice questioned. Agatha straightened up and narrowed her eyes at Jen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.” she choked out, now grabbing a handful of cheeses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Interesting” Alice replied</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Interesting? What do you mean by that?” Agatha scoffed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s just, you seem pretty critical of our relationship, the little you know about it, but that question seemed to be a trigger for you. Why is that?” Alice’s voice was calm and pleasant though it tinged with curiosity. Agatha’s jaw tightened as she readied herself to lash out. Jen, anticipating an overreaction, jumped in.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Maybe, we could talk about anything else? Like, I had the worst instacart shopper the other day, I don’t think they got a single item right! It would have been faster and cheaper to just go on my own but I didn’t have the time. They don’t really have a good reporting system for that kind of thing either, which is crazy. They did give me my money back though.” Throughout her rambling Agatha and Alice maintained eye contact, the tension not dissipating. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If you must know, my wife died.” Agatha responded, calmer than she anticipated, but she could feel the anxiety building in her, her heart quickening.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m so sorry to hear that! You must have loved her very much. I can see why this might be difficult for you, given how close you and Jen are. It can feel like you’re losing a friend when they enter into a new relationship. I do hope you might be open to letting me in, in your own time.” As they sat there in silence for a moment, Agatha could feel the anxiety resolving. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She turned to Jen, “Is she always like this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fortunately, yes.” Jen chuckled and smiled at Alice. “You can’t hide from her, she knows too much, and she’s usually right.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You sound perfect for each other.” She mumbled through a mouthful of tomato and cucumber. Jen’s eyes widened, a smirk growing on her face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did we just get the Agatha Harkness seal of approval?” Agatha rolled her eyes, taking some nuts from the tray. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I guess you could say that. She doesn’t seem </span>
<em>
<span>completely</span>
</em>
<span> insufferable.” Talking as if Alice wasn’t sitting right there. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll drink to that” Jen said, raising her glass to cheers with Alice. At that moment the wait staff arrived and set down their entrees. Staring at the plates before them Agatha wrinkled her nose in disgust. “Something the matter?” asked Jen as she and Alice began to dig into their food.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you not smell that?” She eyed both of them</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Smell what?” asked Alice</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I..I think… it’s your fish. That is absolutely foul…it’s…” she began to gag, fanning herself as she flushed with nausea. “I can’t…” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She quickly rose from the table and rushed to the restroom. She ran through the door, nearly smacking another patron, barely making it to a stall before all she had just eaten was regurgitated into the toilet. She sat there for a moment catching her breath before flushing and exiting the stall. She made her way to the sink, grabbing a paper towel to soak with cool water as she heard the door to the restroom creak open and looked up to find Jen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You good, Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, I’m fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You sure? I’m pretty sure you just upchucked half the charcuterie board.” Agatha took a deep breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No! I’ve felt awful all day but I wasn’t going to cancel since you haven’t stopped talking about this woman since you met her.” Jen stood there silently, taken aback by this admission.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you.” she said meekly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t mention it.” She finished up at the sink and turned to Jen “I’m going home now. If I go back to the table you’ll likely see more of that appetizer.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I understand. Let me go grab your things and let Alice know. We can take you home if you want.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, that's alright. I feel much better now. I just need some rest.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ok, Agatha. Thank you again, somehow Alice really likes you too.” Agatha gave Jen a half smile then turned back to the mirror, adjusting her makeup. Jen left and returned quickly with her items, they exchanged a quick hug and she headed home.</span>

<p>
<span>It had been weeks since Agatha signed the documents and she hadn’t heard anything from her mother or that lawyer she brought to dinner. Not that she was complaining, if she never heard from her mother again it would be too soon. But, she expected before long one of them would reach out to finalize the title of the estate and hand over the keys. She had been trying to go through her lawyer but according to her, they were being difficult and unresponsive. Not surprising, her mother was always withholding when she felt like she had something over Agatha. Then there was that creep of a lawyer, Christian, she shivered at the thought of him. She hoped at this point her interactions with him were over. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>If anything, she was grateful for the lack of contact. It gave her an excuse to push the responsibility of dealing with her grandfather’s property off for as long as possible. Besides, she had enough on her plate. For a week after dinner with Jen and Alice she had a horrible stomach flu. She managed to pull it together the next week before catching a cold that would not go away. It completely exhausted her. Had it not been for Sharon, her assistant, she would have been drowning at work. Sharon was the glue that helped that ship sail, without her innate ability to keep Agatha calm and organized the place probably would have burned down. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As she made her way into work that day, iced latte in hand, she could sense the ominous tone in the building. Everyone was shuffling around, quietly murmuring as they avoided making eye contact with her. She was used to people being standoffish, she carried an intimidating air about her, but this was different. She was clearly the topic of conversation. Brushing it off, she made her way to the administrative side of the building. As she entered the doors to the executive offices, Sharon hurriedly rushed toward her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good morning dear! Oh, don’t you look lovely today! ah-Hahaha”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well aren’t you chipper this morning? What, someone slip up and put an extra shot in your coffee?” Agatha retorted making her way to her office</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know I’m glad I caught you! There’s something you should know before you head in…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If it’s not urgent it’ll have to wait, I’m already running late for my meeting with the florist for Saturday’s fundraiser.” She had nearly grabbed the door handle before Sharon blocked her entry. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Honey, you’re gonna want to be prepared for this before you go in there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha sighed, exasperated. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Your mother is here” </span>
</em>
<span>Sharon mouthed silently, eyes wide with terror. Agatha froze, if she turned and left now, her mother would be none the wiser, but her damn feet would not move. She could feel her chest tightening as her heart started beating faster. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. Moving Sharon aside, she opened the door and made her way in, Sharon closing the door behind her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well hello dear! Glad to see you’ve finally made your way in, 15 minutes late? You’d think with that extra time you could at least make yourself look presentable. Have you even run a comb through your hair?” Evanora stood behind her desk, clearly having snooped around her office.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you want, mother?” She snapped</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have been trying to get a hold of you for weeks but can’t seem to get you to call me so I figured I’d make it easy on you and stop by in person.” Of course, she had forgotten Jen blocked her in her phone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What is this regarding?” She wasn’t going to engage in small talk, this needed to be over as quickly as possible. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your grandfather’s estate. There’s much left to finalize, we have to transfer the deed and that has to be done in person in Boston.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Excuse me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Christian has been waiting to hear from you about plans to visit so he can give you access to the property.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“He’s heard from my lawyer many times and this is the first I’m hearing of any of this. As I said at dinner, any communication will go through her, he needs to let her know. And Frankly I don’t have time for this discussion, I’m already late to a meeting.” Having dropped off her things she made her way back to the door with her mother closely behind. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha!” Evanora shouted. “You cannot ignore this. You cannot ignore me, I am your mother. You need to take this seriously!” Agatha spun around, facing her mother head on. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Enough! I don’t see how any of this involves you in the first place? You let me know of my inheritance, all else is my business he left the estate to me!” She could feel her mother’s anger radiating off her. Evanora was biting her tongue, fighting something she clearly wanted to say. “What is it, why are you so persistent about this? What else do you want from me?” Evanora let her hardened expression slip for just a moment, revealing a glimmer of surprise? Embarrassment? Agatha couldn’t tell, but was shocked nonetheless. “Oh…oh you do want something from me..don’t you?” Her mother straightened herself, gathering courage to finally admit why she was really there. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, there may be a few items… in the house… I was hoping to collect.” she revealed through gritted teeth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, and what might those be?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nothing you will miss, but are important to me.” Evanora stood there for a moment stone-faced, “For God’s sake Agatha, he was my father. Have you no shame?!” her inflection rising as tears began to well in her eyes. She hadn’t expected this moment of vulnerability from her mother, however charged it may be. Never before had the roles been reversed where Agatha held all the cards. She felt the pang of retribution clash with the pity she now felt for the woman in front of her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m agreeing to nothing at the moment. I need time. When I have a chance to get things settled I may have my lawyer reach out to you. Until then I don’t expect to hear from you.” And with that she turned and opened the door intending to leave, but catching Sharon as she fell into her from, having listened in. Quickly pushing past Sharon she made her way down the hall and headed downstairs for her meeting. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She should have known that interaction set the tone for the day. Her meeting with the florist started 30 mins late and she had trouble focusing on the details. She was meant to have a break but starting that late caused them to run over. She then had a quick encounter with the bar staff ensuring they were stocked and ready. The last thing she needed was to run out of alcohol; people tend to have a looser grip on their money if they are properly lubricated. She was disappointed to find they seemed to be understaffed, once again. Thinking quickly she shot Jen a text. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Any chance your new girlfriend has a bartender she could loan me? They can name their price. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Having put out that fire she scurried off to meet with the caterer. The iced coffee from this morning had gotten her to this point but it would only put off her hanger for so long. She needed to eat before she lashed out at the next person to inconvenience her. She made it to the kitchen and just as she entered a girl turned the corner and ran into her, dropping the large bowl of chocolate pudding she was carrying. As soon as it hit the ground the contents splattered all across Agatha. At this point all she could do was chuckle at the absurdity of it all, the rage inside her fizzling into a delirious numbness. In a huff she turned and headed toward the bathroom to assess the damage. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The caterer rushed out to catch her, “I’m so sorry, are you alright?” Agatha turned and through the pudding, plastered a villainous grin on her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Clearly I’m never better!” she said in a sing-song sarcastic way. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to see if I can get pudding out of these pants.” She stormed off back toward the restroom, tears began to fill her eyes. As she looked in the mirror she realized the severity of the damage. She was absolutely covered and she would not be able to get the pudding out of her pants or shirt. At this realization the tears overflowed, streaming down her face, taking some of the pudding with them. She hurried to wipe them away, a rush of embarrassment overtaking her. This was not her! She was never this emotional and she didn’t breakdown like this, especially at work. She had to pull herself together. Luckily she had a change of clothes for the gym in her car. She didn’t have any other in person meetings planned today so it wouldn’t really matter. She could lock herself in her office and finish the day in peace. She ran out to her car and changed in the restroom. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She anticipated the meetings to go through lunch, expecting to have had her fill with catering, but since that did not go to plan she needed to find food and fast. She had just enough time to run to the cafe down the street and grab a sandwich. She hurried out of the building onto the busy city street as she got a call from Sharon. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes?” she barked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, Honey! I’m glad I caught you. Are you doing alright after this morning?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is there a reason you called?” Agatha rolled her eyes and checked her watch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Herb says he needs to move your meeting to today, are you able to head over to his office now?” Agatha groaned, the sandwich would have to wait. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If I must. Tell him I’ll be there in 10, and he owes me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh and I heard about the caterer. Do you need me to get you some foo…” As Agatha abruptly turned around she had managed to run into the person walking behind her, dropping her phone in the process. She let out a winy groan and started to bend down to pick it up. Before she could, the other person grabbed it for her. As she handed it back they made eye contact and her heart dropped. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, it appears we’re destined to run into each other.” said the sultry voice. It was her. Of course it was her. Standing before her in fitted black dress pants and a white button up with the sleeves rolled up. The same cool scent of rain and incense filling the air around her, that delicious smirk plastered across her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I… well…you” Agatha stammered in a fluster. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We can’t keep meeting like this.” The woman said with a chuckle. How could she be so alluring and confident?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t… I didn’t…I have to go.” She started to rush off as she heard the woman behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can I at least get your number! Or maybe your name?” Agatha continued on, not daring to look back and deal with that today. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She managed to make it to Herb’s office only 5 minutes later than she had said. Nearly out of breath and her heart still racing, she made her way in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ah! Agatha! Thank you for being flexible. I know this isn’t ideal but I have to run and meet our guest composer in an hour and wanted to make sure we had everything set for tomorrow. Oh, is everything alright?” He said as he took in her sporty appearance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It will be” She said through gritted teeth. Not entirely hiding her dissatisfaction</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good, did we get everything set with the vendors?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Indeed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fantastic. I did want to go over seating one more time. It appears we are adding 10-15 additional guests and will need to find room for them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, is it 10 or 15?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Plan for more to be safe. Dr. Jones on our board has had some new doctors join his staff at the Children’s hospital and we’ll need to accommodate them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Indeed” She quipped with a sarcastic smile “Anything else?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ensure we have enough bar staff to help monitor how much people are drinking. We don’t need a repeat of last year when Dottie managed to go through a bottle and a half of wine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Already addressed.” She could feel her patience waning. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fantastic! Looks like we’re in for a great evening. I’m rehearsing with the conductor and string quartet this evening. I'd like for you to stop by.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll do what I can. Are we good?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I guess we are. Are you alright? You’re looking a little overwhelmed and a bit disheveled.” Agatha blinked, taken aback by this bluntness. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine, just lots to do, must get to it!” She tried not to sound too pained.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well then by all means. Don’t let me stop you. But Agatha, do make sure you get some rest, we have a big weekend ahead of us and I need you at your best.” Agatha’s face betrayed none of the rage boiling inside her but instead she plastered on the largest smile she could and nodded with a high pitched, “yup”. She rushed to leave his office and return to her cave to review the new task she’d been assigned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As she made her way into her sanctum she slammed the door behind her. Stumbling her way to the couch in her room she flopped down on her stomach letting out a large sigh. After a moment she rolled over to ponder the ceiling and decompress from the chaos of the day so far. She glanced over at her desk noticing something on it. As she raised herself onto her elbows she could see a plate with a sandwich and a bag of chips and a Dr. pepper. Sharon, somehow always two steps ahead. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She wandered over to her desk and devoured the sandwich before starting to redo the seating plan. As she worked she could feel herself growing more and more tired. Her eyes began to droop as she was fighting to stay awake. Eventually the pull to slumber was overpowering and she rested her head on the desk telling herself it would only be a moment's rest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nearly 2 hours later she was awoken by someone shaking her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha! Agatha, dear, you should go home. It’s past 5:00.” In her hazy stupor, she was able to make out Sharon. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What? What happened?” She hadn’t quite settled back into reality. Blinking, she tried to summon her consciousness. She had fallen asleep. At work. At her desk. “Wait what time did you say it was?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, Honey, it’s almost 5:30. You’ve had one heck of a day it seems like. A-hahaha!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“5:30! Ah I have to go meet Herb, he’s rehearsing and he wanted me there.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh no dear. Not today. You need to head home. I’ve already let Herb know you were working on other things and would have to catch up with them tomorrow.” Agatha was so relieved, she didn’t know how she was going to make it through that rehearsal. She had that weak dizzy feeling of having napped too long and she was still so exhausted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you Mrs. Hart.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, sweetheart, how many times have I told you, just call me Sharon.” She gave the woman a faint smile and blearily made her way over to grab her things. “Do you want a ride? Or are you ok to drive?” Sharon questioned </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll be fine, I’m not going far. I’ll see you tomorrow bright and early - lots of work to do setting up.” </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arrived home and made straight for her bed. Despite having slept for a good portion of the work day she was ready to turn in for the night. She lay there for a moment as Scratchy joined her, purring loudly and nudging her to feed him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know Mr., give me a moment and I’ll feed you. I just need to rest a minute.” Scratchy, unmoved by this request, advanced his disruptions and made his way to her stomach. His tiny but painful paws stabbing at her abdomen as he made biscuits. He eventually he found a particularly delicate spot and leaned all his weight down. “OUCH! You really are relentless! Fine, I'll get up!” They walked together to the kitchen and she gave him his food. Quickly checking her phone she found a text from Jen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Alice says she has you covered, just tell her when and where. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She knew she could count on Jen and now she felt she could count on Alice too, at least for this. Breathing a sigh of relief she reached into her fridge and grabbed some cheese, salami, pickles, olives, and a cup of yogurt. Though the sandwich had been filling at the time, she suddenly found herself ravenous. She grabbed a can of tin fish and half a baguette from the pantry and made her way to the couch, turning on the TV as she dug in. Satisfied once again, she could feel the pull of slumber creeping up. Before she could fall asleep in another uncomfortable position she cleared her mess, got ready for bed and went to sleep as the sun was just setting. </span>

<span>The next morning she awoke to a mound of purring fur once again kneading on her stomach. Shooing Scratchy away she rolled over to check the time. As she did so her daily alarm went off and she groaned knowing she couldn’t ignore it and fall back asleep. Groggily, she shuffled around to get ready for the long day ahead. By the time she made her way out the door she finally felt like she had her head on straight, she couldn’t afford to repeat yesterday’s disasters. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She hurried into the building, running into Sharon in the lobby as they both made their way to the little theatre where the event was to be held. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Please tell me the florist is already here” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh yes dear, they arrived about 30 minutes ago and are getting everything unloaded.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good I’ll need to work with them on getting two more centerpieces, we’ve had to make accommodations for some additional donors. Can you go find the caterer, we need to review things sooner rather than later.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course dear, Herb said he planned to stop by with the musicians before lunch, do we have something prepared for them or do you need me to bring lunch in?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ugh, I didn’t even think about that. Yes we’ll need to bring something in.” Sharon stopped her just as they were about to head in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dear, forgive my asking, but are you feeling alright? You haven’t been yourself these last few weeks. You usually don’t miss a beat.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine, I just have a lot going on.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know you probably don't want to talk about yesterday, and your mother…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Absolutely not!” Agatha snapped harder than she intended. “Not today, we have enough going on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright dear, but if you need anything…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t, are we good?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, I’ll go get the caterer.” Sharon scurried off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As she entered the room she could feel the chaos of set up screeching to a halt as all eyes made their way to Agatha. She loved feeling the power of her presence keeping everyone on their toes. She made her way to the front of the room near the small stage and set her things down as the work began to resume around her. She looked around realizing the additional tables and chairs had not been set. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Somebody get me Carl” she shouted as she made herself comfortable at a table nearby. A few people flurried about until Carl came rushing up to her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha! Good morning, how’s everything looking?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m missing those two additional tables I asked for yesterday.” Nervously, Carl glanced around. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Um… sorry, must have missed that. Where did you want them?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well if you bothered to look at the updated seating chart I sent.:.” She stopped short as she was able to log into her computer and see the email she intended to send still sitting as a draft on her screen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nevermind, I’ll show you myself.” They walked around discussing the adjustments as groups rushed off to get everything reset. She settled back at the table just as Sharon returned with the caterer, an iced coffee in her hand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Here you are dear, and don’t worry I made sure they brought some samples for you. You need to eat something.” Despite her hardened demeanor she couldn’t help but have a soft spot for that woman. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you Mrs. Hart” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Anytime dear” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The meeting with the caterer went off without a hitch thanks to Sharon. Though hectic, all was going well. The florist was accommodating and able to adjust to the new seating arrangements and things were coming together just as Herb made his way in with the musicians. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ah Agatha! Glad to see you’re here! I’d like to introduce you to William, our guest composer. This young man has some serious talent! Just wait until you hear the work we’re premiering this evening, positively magical!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You can call me Billy. Nice to meet you ma’am.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Likewise. Well the stage is set, you’re free to rehearse, don’t let me stop you.” She didn’t intend to stick around for the rehearsal. She couldn’t stand the tediousness of hammering in the same passages over and over and didn’t want to hear it so, with everything in motion, she headed back to her office. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as she closed the door she could feel the anxiety she had been carrying begin to melt away. Everything was coming together, as it usually did, but this time it was really exhausting her. As she took a moment to gather herself she got a text from Jen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I know you’re probably busy getting set for tonight but wanted to see if you had time for lunch? </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She had the time, she wasn’t going near the room until the rehearsal was over at 2. Though, she just wasn’t sure if she had the energy to leave and come back more than once and she’d still have to go home and change later. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>There’s no way I’m leaving before 4 today so unless you’re coming to me it’s a no.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I’ll bring you lunch, besides Alice wants to get the lay of the land before tonight. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Alice? She’s the one bartending?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Duh! You thought she was going to fork over her trained staff on a Saturday when she could do this by herself in her sleep? </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha was shocked! She barely knew this woman and did her best to make a bad first impression. Jen really had her wrapped around her finger. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I’m in my office so head up when you get here.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Wait, what do you want to eat?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I don’t care, surprise me. Something light, it’s going to be a long day. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha busied herself with the other work she had been avoiding while preparing for this event. Before she knew it she heard a knock at her door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I come bearing food and an Alice!” Jen announced as she and Alice entered and sat at the couch. “How ya holding up? It’s been a while, are you feeling better?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m fine, what did you bring me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Turkey Club. You’re welcome.” Jen huffed. She grabbed the bag from Jen and started to devour the sandwich. “Damn Agatha, did you forget to eat again?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, but I could eat my way through an entire buffet right now” she said through a mouthful of sandwich. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What time should I be here tonight and what do you want me to wear?” Alice asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Guests will start arriving at 6 so if you want to come back at 5 that should be plenty of time. And just all black. It shouldn’t be too difficult but, you have to watch out for Dorris, that woman has a hollow leg and she’ll drink the bar dry and end up on top of a table. Everyone else needs to get drunk enough to put us in their will.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You got it. I’m looking forward to it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I wish I could be there to see you in action, but alas, babies wait for no one and I have a feeling it’s going to be a busy night. Have you heard from Ralph lately? I thought he was supposed to be back last week?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“His cruise ended in the Maldives and he decided to take some time off. I guess he found a sugar daddy who has whisked him away to Greece or something. That asshole was supposed to be my plus one for this thing so I’m not very happy with him right now.” Agatha grumbled as she sat back in her chair. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good for him!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Whose Ralph?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Lady Bohner” Jen and Agatha said in unison. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh! I didn’t realize you all knew each other. He’s been in and out of my lineup for years!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah he’s a peach.” Agatha said sarcastically. “Well, you want to see where you’ll be trapped for the night?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sure!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I have to head into work, but I’ll see you later!” Jen leaned in and kissed Alice. Agatha rolled her eyes at the affection. “I’ll see you, whenever?” Jen started to walk towards the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What no kiss for me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I would rather give birth.” Jen scoffed and headed out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright, follow me.” She motioned to Alice and they headed back down to the little theatre. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s this event for?” Alice asked as they headed down to the theatre. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We have a yearly dinner for our top donors and feature one of our guest artists. This year they found some wunderkind twink composer. He’s premiering a new work and they’ll be the first to hear it. They love the exclusivity of it so it’s usually one of our biggest nights for donations.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As they approached the room they could hear the quartet running through the music. The tones sounded eerily familiar and hauntingly beautiful. Agatha took a moment to let the sound wash over her before quietly entering, gesturing for Alice to follow silently. They walked over to the bar in the back and Alice began to take inventory and get her bearings while Agatha stood transfixed by the music filling the hall. She eventually made her way to sit at one of the tables to finish listening. As they played the final notes she could feel tears welling in her eyes. This was not like her, but something about the simple melody rocked her to her core. Before a tear could fall she shook her head and took a breath, stilling the cacophony of emotions threatening to burst forth, and turned her attention back to Alice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Any questions? Anything you need for tonight?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I think I’m all set. Do you know what time this usually wraps up?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going to try and get people out of here by 11 but you shouldn’t need to stay past then regardless. We have a crew coming in tomorrow to clean and break down and catering will take care of any dishes.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh this is going to be a breeze!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Obviously you can keep any tips they give you, I can pay you $700 for the night if that works?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Seriously? Yeah that totally works. Thank you”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well you are helping me out of a bind last minute and we have the budget. I’m very good at my job” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not at all surprised at that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, if there’s nothing else you need I have to head out and pick my dress up at the dry cleaner. I’ll see you at 5?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“See you then!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>By the time she got home Agatha had just enough time to grab a snack, feed Scratchy and get ready for the night. She had decided on a bright red dress that she’d had for years that at one time had belonged to Wanda. The top was a tight corset fit with straps over the shoulders and the skirt gathered in cascading waves down the right side. They had always been able to exchange clothes though Agatha was a bit taller than Wanda. As she went to zip up the dress it took a little more effort to get into than she remembered, having to suck in and lift her tits to get it closed. She touched up her makeup adding a bright red lipstick to match the dress and finishing with the perfume oil she got from Jen. She squeezed her feet into a tolerable pair of high heels and grabbed a second pair of flats to change into later, there’s no way she’d make it the whole night in heels. She took one final look in the mirror. The dress was a little tight, but it made her tits look great and she could use that to her advantage with the lecherous donors. Satisfied with the look, she drove back to Music Hall. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She arrived just in time to catch Alice walking up to the building. Dressed in all black, as requested, with her hair tied back, she really knew how to clean up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh hey Agatha! Oh my gosh you look stunning! How does this look for tonight? I brought a suit jacket just in case.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh thank you Alice! You look great, I wouldn’t worry about the jacket, it’ll be more trouble than it’s worth.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They walked in together and headed to the little theatre. Agatha held her breath as she opened the doors hoping everything had come together. She was not disappointed, the air was filled with the scent of the flowers that engulfed the room. Candles flickered on each of the tables and the stage giving the room a warm and inviting glow. The musicians were warming up and all was set. She could now relax and begin to enjoy her evening. This, after all, was her favorite part; prying an ungodly amount of money from these wealthy, decrepit, assholes. After all, they had more money than they knew what to do with, so why not put it to good use. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She headed out to the lobby where she met with Herb. “Agatha, you've done it once again! Everything looks fantastic! If all goes well I think we might break a record.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I intend to!” She said with a villainous grin. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s what I like to hear! They are going to be blown away with the music tonight. That kid has some real talent! Did you get a chance to hear any of it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A bit. I’m interested to hear the whole work.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well you’re in for a real treat! As are you my good man! Good to see you Alan!” Herb called out as he wandered to greet the first of the patrons. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha plastered the most charming smile on her face and joined him in welcoming everyone in. Lawyers, executives, and doctors filed in dressed to the nines showing off their exorbitant wealth, all of which Agatha was eager to siphon from them. At last the board members began to arrive, the first of which was Dr. Jones followed by a gaggle of new doctors. As she took in the faces of those surrounding him her heart began to race. There was one new face that was all too familiar, it was </span>
<em>
<span>her. </span>
</em>
<span>Dressed in a fitted forest green and black suit with a golden tie. Her hair pulled back in a twist with a few strands falling down framing her face. The woman was more enchanting than ever. Determined not to let her professional demeanor slip she took a breath and made her way over to the doctor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Dr. Jones, how lovely to see you! Herb had mentioned you’d be joined by some new colleagues.” She did her best not to make too much eye contact with </span>
<em>
<span>her </span>
</em>
<span>but she could feel the weight of the woman’s gaze transfixed on her, that ever familiar smirk glowing on her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha! It’s been too long! Let me introduce you to some of our new surgeons!” He rattled off the names of the men around him before finally introducing her. “And this is Dr. Vidal, she specializes in neonatology.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pleasure to finally meet you Ms. Harkness.” She said with a wink as she reached out, taking Agatha’s hand in hers before placing a soft kiss on her fingers. “You can call me Rio.” Agatha could feel her face begin to flush and tried to respond.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s mine, the p…pleasure” clearing her throat she tried again. “The pleasure is all mine. Well I’m going to head in. See you all in there.” She turned quickly and rushed back to the little theatre and over to Alice at the bar. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wine, now please!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure” Alice chuckled. “Any particular wine? Or?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t care, just get me something to drink, quickly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You got it.” Alice poured her a glass and she quickly drank most of it. “You good?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine” she choked out. “It’s going to be a long night.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>At that moment she saw the group of doctors entering into the hall, Dr. Vidal quickly spotted her as they found their seats. She couldn’t seem to escape the woman’s attention and worst of all she appeared to enjoy how this unexpected turn of events flustered Agatha. Agatha finished her drink and escaped to her table at the front just as dinner was being served. She picked at her plate and attempted to make small talk with Herb and the composer while she used most of her energy to avoid looking in the direction of Dr. Vidal. At last Herb stood up to make his announcement before the concert started. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thank you all for joining us this evening, you all are in for something truly remarkable.” As Herb spoke Agatha snuck back to the bar. “Young William Kaplan here has composed something very special and you all have the distinct honor of being the first to experience what I am sure will be one of many notable works. But first let’s hear from our young savant!” The room rang out in applause as William took the stage. Agatha turned to Alice and asked for another glass of wine. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thank you Herb, it is really my pleasure to share the premiere of my latest work with all of you” As Agatha sipped her wine she could feel someone approach the bar beside her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Bourbon, neat” she heard the sultry voice of Dr. Vidal. Of course it was her, as if she had been waiting for an excuse to corner Agatha again. Drink in hand she stood next to Agatha, not saying a word, taking in William’s speech. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“This work, in particular, is influenced by the folk songs of my mother’s homeland of Sokovia. Though you may recognize some of the themes used I’ve managed to expound upon them in a way that I hope resonates with each one of you. So without further ado, </span>
<em>
<span>Lullabies of my homeland.</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha and Rio stood there, neither one truly acknowledging the other's presence, as the music began, the haunting melodies from before washing over them. It was then that Agatha realized why they had stirred something in her. Sokovia, Wanda was from Sokovia and had sung many of these folk tunes to her. Immediately she was brought back to when she was pregnant with their child. Each night Wanda would hum these very songs to the little life growing inside her. Now those same tunes were echoing in the chamber around her. She could feel a lump beginning to form in her throat as she fought to hold back the tears forming in the corners of her eyes. She took another sip of her wine before making her way to the bathroom. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Once inside she stopped at the sink running her hands under the cool water and using a towel to cool the back of her neck. It had been one thing to be thrown off by Dr. Vidal’s unexpected presence, but now this music. She could feel herself losing the battle to the tears threatening to fall as they began to stream down her face. She allowed herself a moment for them to pass before she pulled herself together. This was one of her biggest nights and she couldn’t afford to blow it. She adjusted her dress, giving herself a little more room to breathe and fixed her makeup before sneaking back to her seat in the theatre. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Somehow she made it through the rest of the concert without another emotional moment. As the music drew to a close the room erupted in applause. Herb once again made his way to the stage to make a closing statement. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Let’s hear it again for Mr. Kaplan and our wonderful musicians!” Applause once again filled the room. “It is due to the overwhelming generosity of the people here tonight that we are able to support and honor new and growing talent such as Mr. Kaplan. Which brings me to everyone’s favorite part. With your commitment tonight of continuing generosity we are able to offer William a residency and will continue to premier his works along with several other young and highly talented musicians. So as you enjoy the rest of your evening make sure to connect with myself, Ms. Harkness, or any of our other staff you see around to make your donations, which I’ll remind you are tax deductible!” Herb finished with laughter from the crowd. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Now was Agatha’s time to shine. She schmoozed, and sweet talked thousands out of the pockets of the wealthy people around her. She knew which buttons to push to make them fold to her desire. She was in her element, so much so that she nearly forgot about Dr. Vidal. That was until the woman once again managed to corner her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well well well, if it isn’t Ms. Harkness herself, once again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dr. Vidal, I hope you enjoyed the music this evening.” She could feel her heart begin to flutter and a heat rise in her chest at the woman’s presence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh I’ve been enjoying much more than the music this evening. This is quite an event you conjured up. Do you do this often?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We have several events throughout the year but this is by far the most extensive.” She was doing her best to not make direct eye contact. She didn’t want to fall apart at the woman’s gaze. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, you really know how to make an impression. Is it just me or does it seem serendipitous the way we keep running into each other? It’s almost as if the universe is trying to tell us something.” At that she caught Agatha’s direct attention. Rio's eyes glistened as she spoke as if a fire was burning behind them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, and what might that be?” Agatha responded almost sheepishly. Rio leaned in closer. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not afraid to admit that from the moment I first ran into you in the bookstore I was enamored by you. Then you appeared again, and again. But each time you managed to slip away before I had a chance to even get your name, let alone your phone number.” She wagged a finger at her. Agatha’s heart was again racing at the boldness of this woman. “And now here you are, Agatha Harkness, radiant as ever. Perhaps it’s fate?” She said with raised eyebrows as she took a sip of her drink. Agatha stood there stunned and speechless, a blush blooming across her cheeks, her mouth agape as she searched for a way to respond. In the end all she could utter was a meek, “Perhaps.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well I don’t want to keep you from what looks to be an overwhelmingly successful night. Though, I’m not letting you get away this time without at least giving you my number.” She handed Agatha her card. Matte black with glossy gold lettering. “For whenever you’re ready to see where fate takes us. Until then, te veo.” And with that she brushed past Agatha to rejoin her colleagues. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The night eventually drew to a close and the final guests made their exit. Agatha slipped into the flats she brought with her and took a moment to rest as workers began to clear dishware from the tables around her. She looked toward the bar and saw Alice helping to clear and clean glasses. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know you can head home. They’ve got this covered.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh I don’t mind helping out. Makes things go faster. Seems like it was a good night, everything went smoothly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh yes, I’m guessing we nearly doubled what we made last year. Herb will be thrilled.” She and Alice shared a chuckle at that. “Alice” she paused. “Thank you… for tonight. It wouldn’t have been nearly as successful without you.” The words felt foreign to her but she meant them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh of course, anything for a friend.” Agatha was touched by the sincerity in her voice. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh here, before I forget, your check for tonight. If you’re good I am going to head out. I’m afraid if I don’t leave now I might fall asleep on my way home.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh be careful, if you want I can give you a ride.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I'll be fine, I don’t have far to go. I’ll see you around. Oh and tell Jen I owe you two dinner soon.” With that she headed home. </span>

<p>
<span>Agatha was glad to have the next few days off after the whirlwind of the fundraiser. Though she was used to such events this one had really exhausted her. She spent the majority of her break in bed only moving to feed Scratchy and herself. In that time she was able to reflect on how close she had come to unraveling altogether. The music had stirred up many unresolved feelings she had about not only losing Wanda but also their child. The sorrow felt fresh and raw, especially after this final unsuccessful attempt at rebuilding a part of the family she had dreamed of. She let herself wallow in that grief where before she had kept it small and buried inside her. The pain had always been too overwhelming to deal with but now, with nothing to distract her, it overtook her whole body. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She poured over the photos and memories she had stashed away to help alleviate the sorrow and after a couple of days she could begin to feel the weight of the pain start to lessen. As she started to return to a more neutral state she was able to push herself to leave her house; she had to as she hadn’t been to the grocery in weeks now. Though it felt like going through the motions she also felt a sense of relief at the normalcy of it. After picking out the bare minimum to sustain her she made her way to the cashier. When she went to pay, a card fell out of her wallet. As the woman handed it back to her she realized it was the card Rio had given her. In her grief she had forgotten all about her interaction with Dr. Vidal, but upon seeing the card she felt something spark inside her. This twinge of excitement was nearly immediately squashed with an overwhelming sense of guilt. Was she ready to risk her heart again while she still had such unresolved feelings about Wanda? This was not the time or place to sort through this so she made her way back home. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was quite skilled in avoiding most of her unpleasant feelings but after these last few days of letting the flood gates open she had a hard time not contemplating how drawn she was to Rio and the proposition she made. It was as if that little spark had already begun to engulf the space she had just cleared within herself. She couldn’t deny, the woman made her feel a way she hadn’t felt since Wanda and even then, this was something completely new. Yet, she wasn’t ready to move forward. At least not yet, she needed time to get back to herself more completely. She stuck the card to her fridge and took the last of her time off to clean and reset as she was back to work the next day. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The first few days back were luckily uneventful and it allowed her to get back to her normal routine. She was finally feeling back to her formidable self when she got an email from her lawyer about planning a trip to Boston. She had managed to forget about the whole inheritance disaster she still had to handle with her mother. For now she was going to continue to avoid dealing with that so, on the way home that night, she stopped and grabbed a random assortment of snacks and treats to deal with the renewed anxiety. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That evening, as she was settling in to watch a murder documentary surrounded by her chaotic feast, she heard a knock at her door. Assuming it was a mistake or a delivery she tried to ignore it but the knocking came again. </span>
<em>
<span>Who the hell could that be?</span>
</em>
<span> She thought as she made her way to the door. She paused again at the door before the knocking came again a third time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“WHAT DO YOU…?” She shouted as she swung the door open. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey mama!” Ralph purred from the doorway, surrounded by suitcases. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ralph what the fuck are you doing here? Why didn’t you give me a heads up?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought you’d enjoy the surprise! Are you gonna let me in?” She glared at him for a moment before stepping aside to let him enter. He dropped his stuff just inside the door before settling himself on the couch. “Woah those pregnancy cravings are really getting to you huh?” He said as he took in the smorgasbord splayed across the coffee table. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not pregnant you ass.” She snapped at him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You sure about that? I’ve never seen you eat half this stuff.” He picked up a jar of kool-aid pickles raising his eyebrows. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So maybe I’m going through some shit, doesn’t mean I’m pregnant.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh really, what shit?” He asked as he plopped himself down on the couch where she had been sitting. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“My mother” She said, rolling her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh riiiight. Damn, how’s that going?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not. I’m eating about it, can’t you tell?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wanna talk about it?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not really. How was Greece? I missed you at my fundraiser, remember?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know! I’m sorry about that! But you also wouldn’t have said no to a free trip to Greece!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Was it really free?” She questioned judgingly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was worth the price I paid, I can tell you that. And I brought you some presents so you can’t be too mad at me. How’d the fundraiser go?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eh, better than last year. We nearly doubled our donations.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“See I knew you didn’t need me!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“But it wasn’t a walk in the park! Between Evanora showing up at my office the day before, the fucking </span>
<em>
<span>Lullabies of Sokovia</span>
</em>
<span> from the twink composer they brought it, and then that doctor hitting on me. It would have been a lot easier to deal with if you had been there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait, woah, back up, walk me through all of that!” Agatha rolled her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ugh, fine!” She groaned, “Apparently Evanora wants some shit from the house that she can’t get to until I go to Boston and have the deed to the estate signed over and get the keys.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ugh, when is that happening?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have no idea, I’ve been putting it off, as you can see.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ok, now tell me about this twink, is he cute?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s too young and poor for you, honey.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Booo! But his music was good? He’s like a tortured artist or something?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wouldn’t say that. The whole work was his take on Sokovian folk music because of course it was.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ok, and why does that sound familiar?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Really?” She glared at him judgingly. He looked dumbfounded. “Wanda was from Sokovia, bitch.” She snapped at him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh shit! Holy shit no way! What are the chances?!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know, but it’s put me into a dark place. As you can tell.” She gestured toward the buffet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well good thing I’m here now, help dig you out a bit!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He tried one of the pickles before spitting it out immediately. “Ugh, you’ve got to be kidding me with that shit. That is not a normal depression craving, those are foul!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please, they’re not that bad!” She took a bite of a pickle before following it up with mint ice cream. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, nuh-uh, I’m not buying it. Did you actually take a pregnancy test?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes.” She said sternly</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You sure you did it correctly?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What the fuck is that supposed to mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who knows, it could have been a false negative or something. I think you should check again because </span>
<em>
<span>that </span>
</em>
<span>is not normal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not serious.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do I look like I’m joking? I’ll go buy one now if that’s what it takes.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t bother, I think I still have some.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Reluctantly she got up from the couch and headed to the hall bathroom with Ralph following closely behind. She grabbed a test from under the sink and sat down to take it as Ralph stood in the doorway. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Making sure I’m not cheating or something?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Making sure you’re doing it right.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If I can’t figure this out I shouldn’t be a parent.” She quipped back. She smacked the test on the counter before washing her hands then pushing past Ralph. “You want something to drink?” she shouted as she made her way back to the kitchen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just a soda or something. I have to give my liver a break. Hey, how long does this usually take?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Give it a few minutes. Might as well get settled into the guest room and come back to check.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He took his things into the room and eventually came back into the living room carrying the test gingerly with two of his fingers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well?” She asked</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I haven’t looked yet, I don’t want to read it wrong.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh please!” She rolled her eyes and grabbed it from him. “These are idiot proof” She held her breath for a moment before turning the test over. Though she expected it her heart still dropped at the result. “See! I told you, I’m not pregnant.” He took the test back from her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well damn! Then you need to get laid or something because this,” he gestured to the food, “Is beyond pathetic, even for you.” He made his way into the kitchen throwing the test away and washing his hands before going over to the freezer and adding ice to his drink. As he did so he glanced up noticing the card stuck to the fridge. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Dr. Rio Vidal? Ooooo, is this that doctor that hit on you? They sound promising.” Agatha had rushed over at the mention of Rio and ripped the card off the fridge. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That is not something you need to be concerned about. It’s nothing, I don’t know why I even still have this.” She walked over and threw the card in the trash. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“R</span>
<em>
<span>iii</span>
</em>
<span>ght. Because that reaction totally seemed like nothing.” He went over and grabbed the card out of the trash. “So, is she hot?” Agatha sat back down on the couch pretending to ignore the question. “I mean clearly she’s interested or she wouldn’t have given you her number right?” Agatha gave him a sideways glance. “Have you texted her yet? You obviously kept it for a reason. I’m sure Dr. Vidal would love to help you fix whatever it is you’ve got going on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s not that kind of doctor. She’s a surgeon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“AH! A surgeon! Then you know she has to be good with her hands.” Agatha rolled her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t think I’m interested in starting a relationship right now. I have enough going on.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who said anything about a relationship? No need to make a commitment if you just want to play doctor for a bit. Come on! When was the last time you let loose and just went for it?” She sat there silently mulling over what Ralph was saying. “Agatha, do you really want to end up, old, bitter, and alone like your mother?” she snapped her head around to look at him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Excuse me?” she said incredulously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because you are definitely headed in that direction. Seriously, girl, you need to get that pussy ate before it dries up like the Sahara desert.” Agatha’s face was red with rage at that last comment. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ok, I think we’re done here. I’m going to bed.” Agatha stormed off down the hallway to her bedroom.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Love you girl! I just want what’s best for you!” Ralph shouted down the hallway after her as she slammed the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The sudden noise startled Scratchy who was curled up on her bed. With her back against the door she slumped down onto the floor where Scratchy joined her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry mister, didn’t mean to scare you.” She glided her fingers over his fur as he began to purr. She let out a long sigh, </span>
<em>
<span>maybe he’s right</span>
</em>
<span>, she thought. No one had touched her in that way since Wanda. Maybe it </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> time to take a risk, what did she have to lose? For now she let the thought marinate, resolving to sleep on the idea and see how she felt in the morning. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As soon as her head hit the pillow she fell into a deep slumber. As she slept, visions of Dr. Vidal began to fill her dreams. They were back in the little theater where Rio had cornered her, the space between them practically non-existent. She could smell the scent of fresh rain and grass as the woman leaned in, their lips almost touching. Agatha stared into her large doe eyes, aflame with desire. Her hands reached to grab Agatha’s waist, her fingers dug into her back as she pressed her lips against Agatha’s. The delicate sensation quickly gave way to a ravenous hunger as Rio leaned in further, pushing her back into what should have been a wall but instead they began to fall back onto her bed. Rio was now on top of her, her mouth making her way down Agatha’s body. She could feel the woman sucking and biting her nipples as she scraped her fingernails down each side of her body, making their way down around her legs. She felt Rio get up to stand at the end of her bed. She sat up on her elbows to take in the woman’s naked form, her burning eyes pinning Agatha to the spot. </span>
<em>
<span>“You know you want me” </span>
</em>
<span>echoed the voice of dream Rio, her mouth curling into that delicious smirk she always wore. “</span>
<em>
<span>All you have to do is ask” </span>
</em>
<span>She leaned down, her arms curling around Agatha’s legs at her hips as she drew her closer to the edge of the bed. Her gaze never left Agatha’s as she lowered her head between her thighs. Agatha could feel the heat building in her as she drew closer to her core. Just as she was about to make contact, </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>BWAH BWAH BWAH, </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>her alarm jolted her awake from the dream. Agatha was breathing heavily and lying in a pool of her own sweat. Scratchy, having heard the alarm, pounced onto the bed as she began to sit up. “Oh mister, I’m in trouble.” Her heart was still racing, pounding throughout her body. “I think Ralph may have been right. </span>
<em>
<span>FUCK!” </span>
</em>

<p>
<span>Agatha, not being one to admit when she was wrong, did her best to avoid Ralph as the day unfolded. The feeling must have been somewhat mutual as it appeared Ralph was doing his best to avoid Agatha’s attention anytime they were in the same room. This didn’t last long though as Jen sent them both a text around dinner time.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>So which one of you was going to tell me you were back in town, Ralph!? And, Agatha, Alice reminded me you still owe us dinner for helping out at the fundraiser. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Whose Alice?” Ralph asked as he made his way into the living room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, right, I guess you haven’t been here since that started. Jen has a new girlfriend.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh boy, is this another Madison situation?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I think you might actually like Alice. She seems good for Jen.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, well, good for Jen then. Look, Agatha, about last night.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t worry about it, I'm over it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Really though, I’m sorry for bringing your mother into it, that was too much.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Like I said, don't worry about it.” She said with a forced grin. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ok, fine, I’ll drop it. Just know that I really do care about you. I just want you to be happy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That doesn’t sound like dropping it.” He gestured to zip his lips and throw away an imaginary key. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, you buying dinner for me too or just Jen and Alice?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t push it and I just might, if you’re lucky.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe if you see what I got you in Greece you might be persuaded?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Perhaps, show me to me.” He rushed off to the guest room, returning quickly with a gift bag and a wrapped gift. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Here, start with the bag.” She first pulled out a bottle of olive oil followed by a bag of greek coffee. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oooo, alright this is a good start.” She held out her hand anticipating the wrapped item. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This I found on Lesbos island and immediately thought of you. I mean, it’s lesbian island, how could I not?” Agatha snorted and rolled her eyes as she opened the package. She pulled out a navy robe adorned with leaves, flowers, purple butterflies, and snakes winding themselves throughout the foliage. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ok, now this might get you dinner!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It better, it was not cheap! But worth it, considering I did miss your function.” She flashed Ralph a cheeky smile. “So you like it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, I like it very much. So, when do you want to do dinner with Jen?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s see if she’s free tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Hey Bitch! Yes I’m back. Agatha’s buying dinner tomorrow if you’re in? </span>
</em>
<span>- RB</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Hell yeah! Alice says that works for her too. So Agatha, where are you taking us? </span>

<span>- AH</span>

<span>- RB</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As they arrived at dinner the next night Agatha was already regretting agreeing to Mexican food. It was just her luck that once again her stomach felt like it was doing backflips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You sure you’re good?” Ralph asked her as they got out of the car</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine, I’ll just have to take it easy tonight. Ugh, I am so sick of feeling like this like every other day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well if you didn’t eat shit like those kool aid pickles you probably wouldn’t feel like shit. Here, have a mint, maybe that’ll help.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh, that was one time!” She glared at him as she took three mints and shoved them into her mouth. Ralph held the door open as she stormed in. They were greeted by a beaming Jen beckoning them over. Alice was sat in the corner and gave them a small wave and a smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh my gosh hey girl! Long time no see!” Ralph said as he rushed over to hug Jen. “Oh shit, Alice? This Alice is your Alice? Well damn so good to see you too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh right, I guess you two know each other.” Agatha grumbled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Uh, yeah, I’ve only been doing drag on and off at her bar for the last, what’s it been 10 years? Ok, this makes sense. How did you meet Jen?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I guess it was the last time you performed actually. I met her that night and we just kind of hit it off.” Alice said, beaming at Jen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wait, wasn’t that when we were there for your birthday?” He turned to Agatha who was guzzling water. She shrugged, “Yeah, I guess so” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah if you two hadn’t left early that night I might have never met her so thanks I guess.” Jen explained. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Left early?” He turned back to Agatha who was giving him a death glare. “Oh, right yeah. You’re welcome.” Jen glanced between them both with a questioning look. Pushing past her curiosity she turned her attention back to Ralph. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So how was Greece?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh gosh it was amazing! I don’t think I’ve ever eaten as much food as I did there. Everything was so delicious! That reminds me, I have something for you back at Agatha’s. Sorry Alice, no one mentioned you,” he glared at Jen and Agatha  “otherwise I would have brought you something too.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh don’t mention it! I’m just glad to see you!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wow, I wish I could get that reaction out of these two.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey! I was happy to see you!” Jen proclaimed. They all looked at Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I didn’t know you were coming! You just showed up at my house!” She protested, “You should be grateful I let you through the door.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why? It’s not like I was interrupting anything important.” He quipped, giving her a cheeky smile. She drew back in mock offense. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You disrupted my perfectly quiet evening at home.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Isn’t that every evening for you, Agatha?” Jen chuckled. Agatha shot Jen a mocking sneer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s what I told her, she’s due for a little excitement.” He winked at Agatha and nudged her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, when's the last time you even went out?” Jen joked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m out right now aren’t I?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I mean without us, and not for some work thing.” Agatha bit her tongue, avoiding Jen’s stare. “Yeah, that’s what I thought. If you got laid it might do you some good.” Ralph choked on his drink as he started laughing mid sip. Agatha looked at her unamused. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s what I tried to tell her!” He roared. He gave Jen a high five. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh and here I thought I was being nice taking you all out to dinner. I didn’t realize it was so you two could gang up on me about my sex life. This is the last time I do anything nice for you people. At least Alice has the decency to mind her business.” They sat there silently for a moment before Alice spoke up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s always hard to get back out there when you’ve lost someone.” Alice chimed in, drawing all attention to herself. “But it’s good to push yourself to try new things when you’re ready.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh, I forgot you’re like a walking DSM.” Agatha grimaced. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Does Jen know about Dr. Vidal?” Ralph posed. If Agatha could have strangled him with her eyes he would have died right then and there. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha?! Do you have something to share with the class?” Jen said smugly. Agatha, in protest, shoved a handful of chips into her mouth before leaning back in her chair, crossing her arms and looking away from the table. Jen and Alice looked back at Ralph who was grinning like the cat who ate the canary, bursting at the seams with excitement, ready to spill the tea. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Someone got hit on by a doctor and has been keeping her number on her fridge.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“STOP! NO! When did this happen?” Jen exclaimed</span>
</p><p>
<span>“At the fundraiser, right Agatha?” Finally having choked down the chips, she resigned herself to the fact that they would not be changing the subject until she gave them the answers they were looking for. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was technically when I met her, yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you mean technically?” Jen and Ralph asked in unison</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We may, or may not have, run into each other before.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn’t tell me that!” Ralph admonished her, “When did you meet her before?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I met her at the fundraiser. I ran into her before, a few times actually.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait, what do you mean, ran into her?” Jen questioned</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I physically ran into her. Or, she ran into me. Not sure exactly.” Agatha was starting to enjoy being withholding. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well?” Ralph asked</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well what?” Agatha snapped</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh don’t be like that, come on, give us details!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know virtually nothing about the woman, other than her name and the fact that she works at the children's hospital under Dr. Jones on my board.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My children’s hospital? What does she practice?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think I’ve said enough.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s a surgeon apparently” Ralph answered for her</span>
</p><p>
<span>“OOO was it that woman in the green suit?” Alice added helpfully</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can’t I have anything for myself with you people?” Agatha bit back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“AH! It was, wasn’t it! I knew it!” Jen and Ralph turned their attention to Alice. “I would have kept her number too… if I was Agatha” She added, seeing Jen’s twinge of concern. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Have you texted her?” Jen asked. Agatha had returned to her silent stewing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I never did get a clear answer about that” Ralph added, “So?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.” She muttered as she took another drink of her water. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s stopping you?” Alice asked</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not looking for a therapy session, thank you Alice.” She sighed, “Nothing, I just… haven’t felt like dealing with it. I have a lot going on right now.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“When don’t you have a lot going on?” Jen asked incredulously </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s got a point” Ralph added</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Will you drop it if I agree to text her later?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Text her now.” Ralph countered</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well I don’t have her number in my phone yet.” she said condescendingly </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s fine I have the card on me, just in case. I didn’t want to risk you trying to throw it away again.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well that’s…convenient” she chided. They all sat there in silence, waiting for her to pick up the card. “Well, what would I even say?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What did she say when she gave you the card?” Jen asked. Agatha bit her tongue again as a blush grew across her face. She was going to make Ralph suffer for bringing this up in front of Jen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She said to reach out…when I was…readytoseewherefatetakesus” she trailed off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” They all leaned in. Agatha let out a groan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She said to reach out when I was ready to see where fate takes us.” Agatha wanted to slap the look of delight from each one of their faces. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha!” Ralph shouted</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you haven’t texted her yet?” Jen scolded her</span>
</p><p>
<span>‘Ok, ok, let me get this straight. You’ve physically run into this woman on more than one occasion. She is very attractive, from what Alice says,” he nodded in her direction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh yes, </span>
<em>
<span>very </span>
</em>
<span>attractive.” Ralph emphasized his gesture to Alice with a whine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Very attractive, she’s a surgeon who is interested in you enough after these run ins that she gave you her number to reach out when you’re ready to see where </span>
<em>
<span>fate </span>
</em>
<span>takes you. How are you not in her bed right now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve had a lot going on!!” she emphasized. They each groaned and rolled their eyes. “Again, I ask, what am I supposed to be texting her?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Honestly give me your phone, I’m afraid if you do it you’ll screw it up somehow.” Jen reached her hand out as Agatha drew it closer to herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What if I don’t like what you want to send?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll let you read it first!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine.” She handed the phone over.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Hello Dr. Vidal, It’s Agatha Harkness. I thought about what you said the other night and I think I’d like to take you up on your offer to see where fate takes us. When would you like to grab a coffee?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“See, I’m not locking you into anything, just in case she is a freak. You never know with surgeons.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That can be fun though too, as long as you match each other’s freak.” Ralph added with a wink. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ugh, that could be dangerous for everyone involved.” Jen grimaced</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sent, ok! Can we drop it now?” She slammed her phone back on the table. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure… until she texts you back.” Jen said with a grin. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Luckily for Agatha they made it through the rest of their dinner without a word from Dr. Vidal. In fact she managed to make it all the way home and settle into bed with her book before she heard her phone buzz. At first she convinced herself it had to be a spam text and chose to ignore it. Then it buzzed again and curiosity overtook her. She reached over grabbing her phone off the nightstand. Her heart skipped a beat as she saw the notification. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Dr. Vidal - Message(2)</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>As she stared at it contemplating opening the messages, her phone buzzed again </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Dr. Vidal - Message(3)</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Her heart pounded faster and she bit her lip as she unlocked her phone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Hey Beautiful! </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>What a wonderful surprise to hear from you at last! I thought my luck might have run out. 😏</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I’d love to take you out for coffee sometime. Any chance you’re free Saturday?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She checked the time, nearly midnight. She read and re-read the texts a few times, contemplating. She started and deleted a few texts debating on whether or not it looked desperate to reply right away. As she drafted another text another message came through. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Come on, I’ll make it worth your while! 😎</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha could feel her heart beating faster in her chest. There was no hiding at this point so she resigned herself to respond. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Yes, Saturday. 10:00 Espresso Emporium. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She threw her phone back on the nightstand, attempting to push the thought of this now impending date out of her mind. </span>
<em>
<span>BUZZ BUZZ, </span>
</em>
<span>another text. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Yes Ma'am 🫡. See you then gorgeous! </span>
</em>

<span>Saturday morning the pieces slowly came together as Agatha awoke. Dread and panic began to fill her chest as the realization hit, she had agreed to go on a date and today was the day. Maybe she didn’t have to follow through. She could blow it off and no one would know. Though Ralph and Jen and now Alice likely wouldn’t buy it. They surely would be digging for details. She finally gathered herself enough to roll out of bed and head to the kitchen only to find all three of them settled on her couches in the living room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What the hell is this? Does everyone live here now? I don’t remember giving any of you a key.” She scoffed indignantly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ralph invited us over, to go to brunch while you go on your </span>
<em>
<span>date.” </span>
</em>
<span>Jen chided. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“</span>
</em>
<span>I swear if you three show up I will leave.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Relax, we’re going to The Pancake House. But not before we make sure you’re ready! Are you excited?!” Ralph asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m anxious and nauseated. I can’t believe I let you all talk me into this!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, this is going to be so good for you. Who knows you might even enjoy yourself!” Jen offered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I highly doubt it.” With that she grabbed her cup of coffee and turned around, heading back to her room to get ready. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After a long shower to help clear her mind and calm her down she rested on her bed staring at her closet. What was she going to wear? Agatha had always prided herself on her sense of style but in this moment her mind was drawing a blank. She was skeptical about how this date would go and didn’t want to send the wrong message. What was the message? She couldn’t deny it, the mere idea of this woman made her stomach flutter in a way it hadn’t since Wanda. And even then, this was </span>
<em>
<span>very </span>
</em>
<span>different. As she mulled it over there was a knock on her door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Heyyyyy. How’s it going, you almost ready?” Ralph hummed as he slowly cracked the door open and peeked in. Seeing Agatha staring blankly just sitting on the bed in her robe he closed the door behind him and walked over to sit next to her. “Everything ok?” He asked gently. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t know what to wear.” She said in a monotone, not breaking her stare at the closet before her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I can pick something out for you if you’d like?” He said cautiously </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sure.” She muttered as tears began to pool in her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey, hey, what's wrong? What’s going on?” He cooed at her. Agatha inhaled sharply and blinked away the tears. She couldn’t bring herself to admit, even to Ralph, the fear and guilt that was pooling in her chest. She finally turned her attention to him and flashed a smirk. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nothing, I’m fine.” She stood and made her way to the closet. “Are you going to help or just sit there?” She barked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Ralph sorted through some options before finally pulling a nice pair of light wash jeans, a clean white t-shirt, and a pair of black boots and matching belt. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This with your black glasses and a red lip. Classic, stunning, and casual enough for coffee. Come out when you’re ready, everyone wants to see you off.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, Great” she groaned as she took the outfit from him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s gonna be fine. It’s just coffee, at most you can call it quits 30 mins in if it’s really that bad.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ll be lucky if I make it 10 mins. Now get out so I can finish getting ready.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She readied herself in silence before taking a final look in the mirror and heading back into the living room. There she was met with whooping and cheering from the three gathered there. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright settle down!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You look great! Just try and relax and don’t overthink it, you’re just grabbing coffee.” Ralph reassured. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’d say be yourself but that’s usually a bit off putting. So, be yourself but nicer. Try and actually give her a chance.” Jen added </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And no matter what happens, this is a huge step so recognize that. It’s something to be proud of.” Alice finished. Agatha stood there dumbfounded, a look of disgust and judgement spreading across her face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What are you, my fairy godparents?” She scoffed as she made her way to the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And we expect a full report when you get back!” Ralph shouted after her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh goodie” she squealed as she closed the door behind her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The drive to the coffee shop went faster than she wanted it to. Though she hoped to get this all over with as quickly as possible she needed more time to find her usual courage. In every other part of her life Agatha was formidable, a pillar of confidence, but something about this woman shook that foundation within her. Her hands were clammy as she reached for the door handle and entered the shop. With a quick glance around she caught no sight of Dr. Vidal. A wave of relief washed over her as she realized she was the first to arrive. This feeling was quickly replaced by a rush of doubt. </span>
<em>
<span>What if she didn’t show up? </span>
</em>
<span>She took a look at her watch, well, it technically wasn’t 10 yet. She went and joined the que for coffee as she waited for the woman to show. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A few minutes passed before she heard the door open again. Her heart raced as Dr. Vidal entered the shop. She was not as Agatha had expected; black jeans, doc martens, a band T peeking out from under a fitted leather jacket. Her hair fell in waves loosely around her face. She raised her Ray Bans to sit on top of her head, revealing her captivating honey amber eyes which were encircled by a dark smokey makeup look making them particularly fierce. A smirk grew across her face as she spotted Agatha in line. Despite the woman’s casual appearance she was no less stunning than she had been at the fundraiser. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed and straightened herself up as the woman approached her and stopped only a few inches away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hello, Gorgeous!” the woman purred as she stared into Agatha’s eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hello… Dr. Vidal. Nice to see you again.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please, call me Rio. You’re not my patient, I’m not your doctor. Though I’m not opposed to giving you a physical…if you play your cards right.” She said with a wink. Agatha was speechless once again at this woman’s boldness. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I…um…Rio, right.” She choked out as heat began to rise in her chest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, before I forget!” Rio reached into her jacket, pulling out a small bouquet. “My lady” Agatha gingerly took the flowers and rolled them between her fingers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks… thank you for these.” She stuttered. Rio tilted her head as her grin widened. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do I make you nervous?” Agatha chuckled in response. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.” She gasped, unconvincingly. “I just… I don’t do this often.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This as in…dating?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, you could say that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I’ll take it easy on you then.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They made it to the counter and ordered their drinks then settled into a couple chairs in the corner. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So, Agatha Harkness, what made you finally decide to take me up on my offer?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I have to admit, it took a little convincing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh really?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I may have been influenced.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, do tell”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I may have told the wrong people about our… encounters and they were relentless about me reaching out. They were convinced it was meant to be and I was an idiot for not reaching out sooner.” She said with a smirk</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And what about you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Me?” Agatha puzzled</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you think we’re meant to be?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a chuckle. “I don’t even know you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That can change.” Rio leaned forward, a sly grin on her face “What does your gut tell you.” Her eyes bore into Agatha causing her heart to skip a beat. She bit her lip as she could feel the tension between them building. Her arms prickled with goosebumps.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Perhaps” she let it spill from her lips. If Rio’s grin could have been any bigger, she didn’t know how it was possible. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You said you don’t date often. When was your last date?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I…uh… 6, or 7…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Months?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh no, years” Rios eyes widened at that. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Really, why?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why? Well… I didn’t really think about it.”she replied a little flustered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Didn’t think about it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It wasn’t really a priority. I wasn’t really looking or interested. What about you?” She attempted to shift the focus of the conversation anywhere else. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s been a little more recent but nothing particularly stimulating. You on the other hand.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s something about you I find very fascinating.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fascinating?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Intriguing, really. I can’t seem to get you out of my mind.” Agatha blushed at that. Rio was so direct and shameless. Both qualities she would typically pride herself in; however, Rio’s intensity left her feeling unsteady. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t hold back do you?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why would I? Especially when I know what I want.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s admirable. Still, you don’t really know me. What if I’m a serial killer or something?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you a serial killer?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, but you don’t know that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, you just said you weren’t, and you don’t seem like the type. I think I’ll let my guard down. Besides, I’m pretty sure I can handle myself.” She leaned back in her chair sipping her coffee. “I’d like to get to know you, if you’ll give me the chance. So far I like what I’ve seen.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And what’s that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well when we first ran into each other in that bookstore I thought you were kind of a bitch.” Agatha choked on her coffee. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And that was a good thing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you kidding me? The most gorgeous woman I’ve ever seen literally ran into my arms and nearly killed us both. You were so flustered yet aggressive, a part of me wished you would have just pushed me down the stairs.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks?” Agatha muttered as she recalled how enamored she had been at first running into the woman. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Then I think it was that same night you rammed the door into me at the bar.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, I didn’t ram anything! I was just trying to go to the bathroom.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Suit yourself but I had bruises under my eyes for a week.” She laughed</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And again, that was a good thing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not that part, but later, somehow I convinced you to dance with me. Best night of my life since I moved here. You can be fun when you want to be.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Right”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“But you snuck off before the song was over so I never got a chance to get your number. Or your name for that matter. I started referring to you as bookstore girl.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Charming.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I had gone back to the bar a couple times hoping to see you again but no such luck.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, that’s not a typical night for me. I was there with a few friends.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I see. Well luckily for me the universe was on my side when out of the blue, after weeks, you ran into me head on once again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you hadn’t been following so closely that wouldn’t have happened.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t expect you to randomly turn around and head straight into me.” She chuckled, “But I’m not complaining! After the third time of this happening I knew fate was intervening. Once is a fluke, twice a coincidence, three times? That is fate.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I see, and the fundraiser, was that fate too?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh definitely fate! It was right after you ran into me that last time. I was meeting with Dr. Jones that afternoon, he’d asked how I was settling in, if I’d had a chance to check out the symphony yet. I mentioned one time in passing that my father was a musician and now he asks me if I’ve gone to the symphony every time I see him. Anyway, I told him no I hadn’t gotten a chance and he jumped at the opportunity to invite me to your soirée. To be honest I wasn’t inclined at first, he rambled on and on about being on the board and everything, but then he showed me a photo.” A devilish grin returned to her face. “And </span>
<em>
<span>someone </span>
</em>
<span>caught my eye.” She pointed a sly finger at Agatha. “I knew then fate was once again intervening, as if this,” she gestured between the two of them, “was inevitable. And who am I to deny fate?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sat there for a moment mulling over Rio’s version of events before asking, “What brought you to Westview, was that also fate?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Most likely, but primarily this opportunity at the children’s hospital and a chance to be closer to my aunt. She’s my last living relative.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I see, and where were you before?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Boston medical center. I’d done my residency there.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is that where you’re from originally?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I grew up in Puerto Rico and my mother moved us to New York when I was 8.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whose us?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“At that point it was just my mother, my younger brother and I. Our father had just passed away.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh I’m sorry to hear that. You mentioned your aunt is your only living relative?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What, I mean, you don’t have to talk about it but…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What happened to my mother and brother?” Agatha nodded slowly. “They died in a car wreck about six years after that.” She had said it so casually, so matter of fact like she was talking about the weather. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That must have been difficult for you.” Agatha finally responded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh yes, probably the worst year of my life. But my aunt took me in. Helped me finish school, encouraged me to go to college and supported me through medical school. I don’t know where I would be without her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She sounds like an incredible person.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m very lucky to have her. And what about you? What’s your family like?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha grimaced at the thought of delving into the chaos of Evanora. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I um…my family is…”she struggled to find the right word. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s start here. Are both of your parents alive?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes? Or no? I’m not really sure.” Agatha strained in response. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are an endless well of mystery. What does that even mean?” She laughed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well my mother is, unfortunately, still living. My father may be alive, may be dead. I don’t really know anything about him.” She waited for a response from Rio but the woman just sat back in her chair patiently waiting for Agatha to continue. “I grew up living with my mother and her father. It was…difficult. She and I don’t really see eye to eye on most things.” Again she waited for some response but Rio just sat there taking everything in allowing Agatha to continue in her own time. “My grandfather on the other hand was more understanding, but after I was sent away at 16 it made it difficult to see him.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sent away?” Rio finally asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah, yes, first to a conversation camp then to a religious boarding school until I turned 18 and was able to get out on my own.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck! I guess I should be glad that didn’t stick.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted, “No, it definitely didn’t stick.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So how did you end up at the symphony?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I managed to work my way through college where I studied business and communications with a minor in music. I worked as a financial planner for a while but that wasn’t particularly stimulating. Music was always something I shared with my grandfather and when I saw that they were hiring a donor engagement coordinator I figured it’d be a great opportunity for a career switch. With my connections as a financial planner it was a no brainer. Besides, I can be very persuasive.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t doubt that at all! So do you play any instruments? Sing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My mother insisted I learn to play piano as a child. Eventually I picked up the cello as well. I don’t really sing, but I am very good at karaoke.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh really?!” Rio raised an eyebrow, a mischievous glint filled her eyes. “Well I’m going to have to see that in action.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?!” Agatha’s face dropped revealing a brief look of panic. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You can’t brag about your karaoke skills and not expect to perform at some point.” Her signature smirk had returned to her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ll see if you last that long. I don’t sing on a first date.” Agatha said teasingly</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh? Well that’s a privilege I’m willing to earn.” The glint in her eye gleaming brighter. “Well I seem to have finished my coffee.” She said as she stood and started to grab her things. Agatha, startled at the sudden shift, stumbled to get up and gather her things as well. “I’ve really enjoyed getting to know you Ms. Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s it?” Agatha gasped in shock. Rio looked back at her with a grin. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Unless you’d like to continue this elsewhere? I’m not opposed, I just didn’t want to push my luck.” Agatha blinked back at her, mouth agape. This woman was so unpredictable. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I…uh…what do you have in mind?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have a few places I’ve been meaning to check out around the city. Care to join me?” Agatha hesitated, she hadn’t anticipated leaving the coffee shop but she couldn’t imagine ending things here. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Great, I'll drive. Meet me out front?” Before Agatha could respond Rio was out the door. She stood there for a moment as it began to sink in what she had agreed to. Before panic and doubt could overwhelm her she walked out of the coffee shop to wait for Rio on the sidewalk. For the first time since she got there she took a glance at her phone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>

<span>Ralph Bohner - message(2)</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Hey girly-pop! Hope you made it there alright. If you can, get a picture, I need to know what this woman looks like! </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Hope things are going well, let me know if you need me to call and get you out of there! </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She rolled her eyes and started to reply when the roaring sound of a motorcycle jolted her from the conversation. She looked up to find Rio dismounting the bike before taking off her helmet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have got to be kidding me.” She scoffed nervously. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nope.” Rio replied with a grin, handing her the helmet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know that I’m dressed for this?” She panicked, looking into the mirrored visor of the helmet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t worry, you can wear my jacket.” She peeled off the coat and held it open for Agatha to put on. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Won’t you be cold? Shouldn’t you also be wearing a helmet?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I run hot, I’ll be fine. Also I have a spare helmet in the bike.” She wandered back over to the bike and pulled out a second helmet from the seat. “You don’t look convinced.” She laughed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just… this is new for me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well aren’t I the lucky one to pop this cherry for you! Don’t worry, I’ll be gentle.” Agatha let out a breathy laugh before reluctantly putting the helmet on her head. As soon as it was on, the intoxicating aroma of Rio filled her nostrils. She was thankful the visor was covering her flushed face as the scent began to make her heart race. Having situated her own helmet Rio made her way over to adjust Agatha’s. She flipped the visor open, causing Agatha to jump, and reached her hand in to press a button. She heard the sound of a headset turning on before hearing Rio’s voice in her ear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It can get pretty loud when we’re riding. This way we can hear each other so don’t be afraid to shout if you need anything.” Rio snapped the visor back down, causing Agatha to jump once again, then she made her way back onto the bike. She reached out a hand to Agatha inviting her to join. Agatha slowly approached the bike and less than gracefully swung her leg around to sit behind Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hold on tight!” Rio warned as she started the bike. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where and the handles?” Agatha shouted into the helmet. A laugh echoed through the speakers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right here.” Rio grabbed Agatha’s wrists and wrapped them around her waist before gliding away from the curb. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As soon as they were off Agatha was glued to Rio’s back. At first, despite the helmet, she squeezed her eyes shut too afraid to look at how close the cars were beside them. She was thankful for Rio’s jacket as she could feel the air whipping around them as they sped through the city. As she squeezed Rio close she could feel the heat radiating off of her. A permeating warmth that grounded her as they flew across town. As they started to slow, nearing their destination, she chanced a look at the world passing by around them. Terrifying at first, she quickly relaxed into the ride just as they were pulling up to the library. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio rolled the bike to a stop and dismounted, holding a hand out for Agatha. After taking a moment to gather herself Agatha shakily took Rio’s hand and slid off the back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How was it?” Rio asked as she helped Agatha out of the helmet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not </span>
<em>
<span>as </span>
</em>
<span>terrifying as I expected.” She said breathlessly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That grip you had on me said otherwise.” Rio joked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, the library?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes!” Rio said excitedly as she started toward the entrance. Agatha rushed behind to catch up with her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why the library? Not that I’m complaining.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“New city, new library card. I have one from every city I’ve lived in.” Agatha followed Rio in and up to the information desk. “Hi! We’re here to get a library card.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just you or both of you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That depends,” she turned to Agatha. “Do you have a library card?” Agatha couldn’t remember the last time she set food in a library. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t think so.” She admitted. Rio turned back to the librarian. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Both of us then.” The woman grabbed two forms and handed one to each of them. Rio thanked the woman then led them both over to a table. Once again this was the last thing Agatha had expected to do today but the analog simplicity of it was endearing. She glanced over at Rio who was diligently filling out the form and began to do the same. They returned the forms and handed over their IDs for the librarian to scan. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Here you are. Welcome to Westview library.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Excellent!” Rio cheered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now what?” Agatha asked, staring at the plastic card in her hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We could take a tour of the facility or move on to the next destination? It’s up to you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Next destination?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, like I said, I have a few places I want to check out. Here, what do you like to read?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m pretty open. Just nothing political.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good to know. I’m a big fan of nature. Love adventure stories, fiction or nonfiction.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ok?” Agatha responded confused. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m giving us 10 minutes, I’m going to find a book for you, and you’ll pick out a book for me. Read? Set? Go!” Rio rushed off down one of the aisles of books while Agatha stood there for a moment processing what was happening before she turned to search on her own. She barely knew where to begin. Nature. Adventure. Very wide parameters. After running down a couple aisles and finding nothing she returned to look at some displays at the front. The first one was sports related. Fine but not what she was looking for. Another display featured classic mysteries. Better but none of them were particularly outdoorsy. The last display featured Unlucky Explorers. Stories of adventure where one wrong move caused unforeseen tragedy. That’s it! </span>
<em>
<span>The Worst Journey in the World </span>
</em>
<span>by Apsley Cherry-Garrard. Tales of polar tragedy. Satisfied with her selection she sauntered over to Rio who was already leaning against the counter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So what have you got for me?” Rio questioned. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You first!” Agatha insisted. Rio flipped over the book </span>
<em>
<span>Emily Wilde’s Encyclopedia of Faeries </span>
</em>
<span>“Not at all what I was expecting!” She exclaimed </span>
</p><p>
<span>“In a good way or a bad way?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know. That’s not something I would have picked for myself.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good, I like broadening your horizons. Alright, your turn!” Agatha handed over the book. Rio’s face was one of surprise and delight. “Ooo, nice work!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you know it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve heard the stories but never really dug into it. I’m excited!” She reached to grab both books and checked out. As she handed the book back to Agatha she said, “Here, don’t lose it.” She winked “Now, you up for the next stop? Or can I take you back to your car?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I think I have time for one more stop.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Great, let me go to the restroom and we can head out.” Agatha wandered near the entrance to wait and checked her phone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Ralph Bohner - message, missed call </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Jen Kale - message</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She checked Jen’s message first. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Hey we’re wrapping up brunch and headed back to your place. Let me know if you want us to bring something back for you. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That was 20 minutes ago. Surely they’d left by now. Oh well, she’d go to this next stop then figure out something to eat on the way home. She moved over to check Ralph’s messages. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Hey! How’s it going? Please let me know you’re alive and this woman doesn’t have you trapped in her basement. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She rolled her eyes and replied. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>I’m alive, it’s going well. I’ll be home in a bit. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She moved to put her phone away and felt it buzz in reply. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>BIIIITCH! Finally! Yay! Can’t wait to hear all about it! Remember to get me a picture! </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She started to reply as Rio walked out of the bathroom. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Texting your girlfriend?” She joked</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Very funny. Where are we off to now?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ll just have to wait and see.” She reached forward and grabbed the door. “After you, my lady.” They walked side by side back to the bike. Rio put their books in the seat compartment and they settled themselves in for the next journey. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Now knowing what to expect she was able to enjoy the ride this time. The breeze was refreshing and she could relax into Rio’s warmth. For the first time in a long time she felt a sense of safety that she didn’t realize she had lost. Before she knew it the vehicle began to slow again as they approached the botanical gardens. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“This was on your list of things to do today?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah! Why not? I was thrilled to find Westview has a botanical garden and a decent one by the looks of it. Have you ever been?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not in years!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well this should be fun for both of us then.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Once again she held the door open for Agatha who waited just inside the doorway as Rio got the tickets. “And that is why you get the library card first. Gives you a discount at most museums in the area.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled, “Good to know.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She followed Rio who rushed in to gawk at the plants towering above them. She silently stuck to Rio’s side as she bounced from plant to plant spouting facts every now and again when she reached particular plants. She admired the childlike wonder she had as they explored what was admittedly a mediocre greenhouse. Finally, as her curiosity peaked she dared to ask a question that had been on her mind. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How do you know so much about plants?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“My mother knew almost everything about plants. Our apartment in New York was practically a greenhouse. That woman could make anything grow, even if it was on the brink of death!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you remember all of this from when you were a child?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, “A bit, but after she and my brother passed my curiosity peaked. I poured a lot into the few plants I was able to take with me. It made me feel closer to her. I have to admit, I’ve inherited quite the green thumb myself.” At this point they had wandered back to the entrance. “Well I don’t want to keep holding you up but any chance you’d want to grab a bite to eat on our way back? I’ll make it quick.” At the mention of food Agatha could feel her stomach grumble. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That sounds like a good idea. I didn’t eat anything before the coffee.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jeeze, then we better get going! I don’t need you passing out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hate to say that’s not uncommon.” Rio gave her a quick glare before they hurried off to find something to eat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They sped through the city once again until Rio stopped at a hole in the wall Greek restaurant. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hate to admit I’ve been here at least once a week since I started at the hospital. They have the best gyros.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t even know this place existed and it’s right down the street from my office.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well you are in for a treat!” She opened the door for Agatha, following closely behind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ey! Rio! How’s it been? You want your usual?” Shouted a large Greek man from behind the counter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey! Lukas! Good to see you, make it two. I’ve brought someone with me this time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You got it, 2 coming up!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You were not joking. They already know you by name.” Agatha giggled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ok so maybe it’s a few days every week. You’ll understand when you try it.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Before long Lukas handed over two wrapped gyros to Rio along with a small box of baklava. “Take this too, on the house for your pretty lady friend.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thanks man! I appreciate it!” She said as she grabbed the items. They headed over to a small booth in the corner and tucked in to their meal. Rio quickly unwrapped her gyro taking a few large bites as she sighed in pleasure at the taste. Agatha tentatively unwrapped hers before taking a small nibble. As she chewed her eyes began to widen. It was the most delicious thing she had ever eaten and now she was ravenous. She greedily devoured the gyro in a matter of minutes, finishing even before Rio who sat there amused. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I take it you enjoyed that?” She chuckled at Agatha as she finished her last bite. Agatha nodded her head vigorously. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You shouldn’t have brought me here.” She mumbled through the bite of food. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh no?” Rio raised her eyebrows. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is too close to my office, I’ll be in here all the time now.” She smirked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Here that Lukas! You’ve trapped us both!” Rio shouted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As they finished off their meals with the sweet treat from Lukas, Agatha couldn’t help but feel a wholeness settling in. Though unexpected, this date had gone better than she ever could have anticipated. The initial sparks she felt for this woman were rooting themselves deeper inside her. At that realization she felt a wave of nervousness and nausea bubble within her. She was not ready to fully accept the feelings rising above the carefully crafted walls she had built inside her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So, I think I need to be heading back.” She uttered as Rio finished her slice of baklava. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, of course. If you’re ready we can head out!” She nodded and followed Rio back out to her bike. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>In a matter of minutes they were back at the coffee shop parking lot near her car. Agatha dismounted the bike and handed over the helmet for the last time that day. As she settled her things in her car she suddenly remembered Ralph’s request. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t want this to come off as creepy or anything but, can I get a picture of you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Need to save something for later?” She said with a glint in her eye. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, no, I just… my friend.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m joking, come here we’ll take a picture together.” She pulled Agatha close to her side as she held up her phone and snapped a shot of them both. “I’ll send it to you.” She gleamed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So, any chance I earned a second date? Dinner perhaps?” Rio suggested cheekily </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Perhaps. Depends on when and where you were thinking?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll have to check and see. Maybe I’ll call you and we can figure it out?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sounds like a plan.” They stood there for a moment, neither one ready to walk away first. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh don’t forget your book!” Rio quickly grabbed it from her bike and sauntered over to hand it to Agatha. Once again she stood impossibly close, Agatha could feel the heat radiating off of her. Her honey amber eyes were so enchanting they melted her from the inside out. She could feel the tingling of tension between them, her heart pounding as she ached for the distance between them to dissipate. She opened and closed her mouth a few times trying to find anything to say but came up flustered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well..” she muttered at last</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well?” Rio echoed, a tinge of teasing in her voice. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I guess… we’ll talk soon?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Most definitely!” Rio reached down to grab her free hand and planted a kiss on the back of her fingers. “Until then, te veo!” With that she turned on her heel, got on her bike and rode away. Agatha stood there in the parking lot for a moment feeling the cold void filling the absence of Rio’s presence. Almost in a haze she eased into her car and headed back home. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>On the road Agatha began to let everything sink in. An overwhelming rush of emotions washed over her. Excitement, joy, hope, doubt, fear, anxiety. The date had been…good? The way this woman made her feel like her body was crackling with electricity. Like she had been swept up in a gust of wind that spun faster and faster, turning into a vortex. She was falling for this woman and it left her stomach in knots that were working their way up into her throat. All of a sudden she felt her temperature spike and a cold sweat begin to form on her forehead. The nausea she had begun to feel in the restaurant was becoming more intense. She was nearly home; she just had to make it a few more miles. She quickly pulled into her driveway, barely turning off the car before bolting for the front door. She was steps away from the porch before it overtook her. She upchucked into a hedge near the steps. As the food she had just eaten was reappearing the front door swung open and Jen, Alice, and Ralph rushed on to the porch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha?” Ralph called out as they looked to her car. Gripping the handrail, she pulled herself upright to greet them. Her hair was disheveled and there were tears streaming from her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha! What the fuck?” Jen rushed down to meet her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine! I’m fine! Just let me get inside.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She pushed past Jen to head to her bedroom, the group following closely behind. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you need us to get you anything?” Jen called out, Agatha ignored her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did she do something to you?” Ralph asked</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What? No!” She whipped around before continuing her journey. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So it went well?” He grinned as she slammed her bedroom door in his face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Safely inside she let out a deep sigh and slumped against the door. Thankfully, with the contents of her stomach now in the front yard, the nausea had dissipated. She stumbled to the bathroom to clean up whatever mess she had made. As she flicked the light on she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror. Only then did she notice she was still wearing Rio’s jacket. </span>
<em>
<span>Fuck! </span>
</em>
<span>She peeled the jacket off and threw it on the floor; it having caught the brunt of her mess. She washed her face and brushed her teeth before changing into sweatpants and the robe Ralph had gotten her then flopped herself on her bed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Knock, Knock </span>
</em>
<span>“It’s Jen, I come with tea!” Hearing no protest Jen cautiously entered the room. Agatha groaned from the bed and reached out her hands for the mug. “Ginger, lemon and honey. Should help to settle your stomach.” Agatha clutched the mug holding the warmth close as she sipped.</span>
</p><p>
<span> “Not to be </span>
<em>
<span>that guy. </span>
</em>
<span>But are you good? You’ve been getting sick a lot lately.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine, it's just stress.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Riiiiight. I need you to know that is not normal.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sure it’s nothing. It comes and goes. And look, gone again.” She smiled tauntingly as she took another sip. Jen glared at her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well since it’s nothing and it’s </span>
<em>
<span>gone </span>
</em>
<span>you might as well come out and regale us about how the date went.” She said self-satisfied. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was fine, it was a date. What else is there?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t think just because you rushed in here we didn’t see that jacket you didn’t have on before!” She chided. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, “Can I at least finish this tea in peace before I’m interrogated?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can buy you about 10 minutes before Ralph busts through that door.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine, whatever, just let me sit here </span>
<em>
<span>alone</span>
</em>
<span>, thank you.” Jen sauntered out of the room and Agatha was once again left with the swirling thoughts that had started in the car. Just has she had settled back down her phone buzzed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio Vidal - message</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She swiped to check the message. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>We make a devastating couple if I do say so myself. *attachment</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The photo Rio had taken. They were indeed an attractive couple. Rios smouldering gaze and her signature smirk radiated through the phone. Upon viewing herself she couldn’t help but see the joy also emanating from her face. A look she hadn’t seen in ages, not since Wanda. She had almost forgotten how it could feel. And with Rio it took on a whole new light, it was exhilarating. Not wanting to get herself worked up again she closed her phone before she took the final sips of her tea and braced herself to face the hoard waiting for her in the living room. As she stomped down the hallway she could hear the chatter begin to quiet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How’s it going? Feeling better?” Ralph asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Never been better.” She replied unenthusiastically</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good…good…so?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So how’d it go?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Great. What’d you talk about?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh, this and that. You know.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You wanna tell us about the jacket?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eh, not really.” She was enjoying every minute of torment. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha! I swear if you don’t give me </span>
<em>
<span>something</span>
</em>
<span> I will strangle you.” Ralph threatened </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She let me borrow it, I forgot I had it on.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No shit! Come on! We’ve been waiting all day! I need details!!” He whined “You were gone for like 3 hours, you were radio silent for the first half. I was this close to driving to the coffee shop to see if you were good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well you would have been disappointed.” She chuckled </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wouldn’t have been there.” Jen and Ralph gasped as Alice quietly sat in the corner enjoying the show. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“WHAT!! You went to a second location? Or did you bail? Please tell me you didn’t bail!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I did not bail! She did, in fact, take me to a second location.” They squealed with excitement. “And then a third… and I guess technically a fourth.” More squealing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“AGATHA!” Jen shouted </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Details! Details!” Ralph began to chant. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We actually spent very little time at the coffee shop. We chatted for a bit. She told me about her family, or lack thereof, how she came to Westview. She asked about my family.” At that she grimaced “I kept it light. And before I knew it she was getting up to leave.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She said she had some things planned for the day but invited me to join her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“As in she planned to take you somewhere or you just joined her while she went grocery shopping or something?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Um I’m not sure. She drove us to the library.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Huh, you could make that a cute date thing I guess.” Alice offered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She said she had to get her library card. She made me get one too.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is sounding more like a task than a date.” Jen quipped</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then she gave us 10 minutes and we picked out books for each other.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Awe cute!” Alice cooed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ok then what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She asked if I wanted to go to the next stop and I said sure.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my gods! It’s like pulling teeth! Where did you go Agatha?” Ralph said mockingly</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We went to the botanical gardens.” This was met with dramatic table slapping and gasps</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ok, ok, definitely planned a whole day date. You don’t just </span>
<em>
<span>go</span>
</em>
<span> to the botanical gardens.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know she seems like the type.” Agatha replied. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m gonna bring us back here, where does the jacket fit it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh well I told her I didn’t think I was dressed properly to ride on her motorcycle so she offered me her jacket.” The look on their faces was priceless. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ahhhh! Shut up! SHUT UP!” Jen and Ralph shouted</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, tell me you got it. Tell me you took a picture of this woman.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No” she smirked. Ralph’s face began to turn a unique shade of red. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“One thing! All I asked was for one thing and you couldn’t even…” she cut him off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She took a photo of us and sent it to me.” Ralph collapsed on the back of the couch dramatically. Still lying there he swung his arm out and gestured for her to hand over her phone. She rolled her eyes as she pulled up the photo and handed it over to him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Holy shit” Jen shouted peering over his shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah that’s her!” Alice commented </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I ju… what…I don’t even…” Ralph stuttered for a moment. Agatha took her phone back from him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So now that’s over will you all get off my back?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha! Please tell me you’re</span>
</p><p>
<span> seeing her again! You cannot let </span>
<em>
<span>that woman</span>
</em>
<span> get away!” Ralph shouted exasperatedly</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I…I don’t know, she said something about…maybe getting dinner sometime. I’ll have to think about it.” She did her best to hide how truly head over heels she was for her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha, I need to hold your hand when I say this, don’t fumble this baddie.” Ralph scolded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah this woman seems to like you, for whatever reason, if you think there’s any possibility you might reciprocate any of it you cannot blow her off. Don’t be a bitch” Jen lectured</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh really? She said that kind of turned her on.” She raised her eyebrows at Jen </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So she </span>
<em>
<span>is</span>
</em>
<span> a little freak. I knew it! Well even more of a reason to </span>
<em>
<span>not fuck it up</span>
</em>
<span>!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you like her, Agatha?” Alice asked softly. She froze for a moment at the question. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She is a…very attractive person.” She could feel herself start to blush as her eyes darted around not wanting to find anyone’s line of sight. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Obviously, That’s not what she asked.” Jen scolded</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don't dislike her.” Agatha admitted, though she knew that was beyond putting it mildly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Close enough.” Ralph clapped his hands together, resolved. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How did you feel about the date today?” Alice followed up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You just </span>
<em>
<span>had</span>
</em>
<span> to hook up with a therapist didn’t you?” She glared at Jen</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m not your therapist, just a friend looking out for you. It’s ok if you need to take time to think about it. You seemed…overwhelmed when you got home.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, throwing up your lunch is a little overwhelming!” She snapped </span>
</p><p>
<span>“About that…” Alice started. With this Agatha was at her limit of being questioned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No! No thank you! I think we’re done here. You all have been…well you’ve been in my house and I’d say it’s been a pleasure but I would rather burn at the stake at this point. Out!” She gestured for them to get up and she started herding them out the front door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey all my stuff is here! I’m staying with you!” Ralph protested. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sure you can find anywhere else to be for at least a few hours. Huh? Jen you got him right?” With that she closed the front door and headed to her bedroom where she snuggled with scratchy, started the book Rio had picked out and eventually fell asleep rather early. </span>

<span>True to her word Rio had called her the next day to make dinner plans. They agreed to meet the following weekend as she was working or on call throughout the next week. This gave Agatha time to think. After everything that happened with Wanda and trying to have kids she had never considered another relationship, at least a serious one. She thought sure maybe a fling here or there far into the future but she didn’t expect someone like Rio to enter her life. Sure they’d only been on one date, but the way just the thought of this woman made her stomach flutter and she knew her feelings were more than just physical attraction. According to Rio it was fate, though she wasn’t sure she quite believed that, there was definitely something there that she was being pulled into. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>On top of the swirl of emotions she felt over Rio, her body was once again betraying her. Each morning she would wake up in a cold sweat, heart racing, as images of the woman faded from her dreamy state. She would move to get up and ready for the day only to find her joints stiff and swollen and her back aching. She could see a tired puffiness in her face and chalked it up to water retention and stress as she had not been sleeping well. Nothing a morning run and a cold shower couldn’t fix. The week itself seems to drag on and on and she found herself more exhausted than ever. More than once Sharon caught her taking a nap on the couch in her office. The only thing that got her through were the random flirty texts from Rio. Each notification filled her with excitement and anticipation for their date on Friday. She felt like she was in her 20s again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>By the time Friday rolled around though she was running on fumes. She managed to make it out of the office early enough to try and take a nap after work before she had to get ready. She hadn’t even managed to make it to her room and found herself being awoken by Ralph a couple hours later from the couch. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You gonna make it to dinner?” He laughed as he shook her awake. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ugh, what time is it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“6:00”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shit, I’ve got to get ready.” She sat up stretching and shaking herself awake. “I feel like I got hit by a bus.” She said in a sleepy stupor. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not going to lie, you look like it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Great! I do not have time to fix this. I’m just gonna cancel.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No! We can work with this. I’ve already got your outfit picked out, just go wash your face and pull your hair back. You’ll be fine!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She groaned as she forced herself off the couch and down the hallway to get ready. As soon as she caught sight of herself in the mirror she decided this needed more than a freshen up at the sink and hopped in the shower. The steaming hot water felt good on her joints and helped to wash off the stress of the day. By the time she made it out she only had 30 mins to finish getting ready. She threw her hair up quickly clipping it into a big loose bun, a few pieces falling in waves by her face. She hurriedly applied some mascara and one of the lipsticks Jen had given her before heading into the bedroom to take a look at what Ralph picked out. On the bed was a black strapless jumpsuit with a gold belt. Something she had worn before at one of her galas, but hadn’t picked out in a while. She remembered it being a bit snug but as she went to pull it on found it nearly impossible to zip. She wandered out into the hallway knocking on Ralph’s door for assistance. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I can’t get this zipped and I have like 5 minutes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Turn around…suck it in…lift them up” she was able to comply just enough for him to zip it leaving no room to breathe. She turned around to face him with a look of discomfort. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know if this is going to work.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You do kind of look stuffed into it like a sausage but hey your tits look amazing” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t breathe let alone sit or eat.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine we’ll go with plan b.” He sauntered off to her closet to pull out a strapless dress that featured watercolor shades of purple swirls. “More room to breathe but it’ll still show off what the good lord gave you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Great, now get me out of this!” She quickly shed the jumpsuit and had Ralph help squeeze her into the dress. “This will have to work.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Again, may be a little tight but the tits look great. I think she’ll really appreciate it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fantastic! Don’t wait up!” She shouted as she rushed out the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The ride to the restaurant seemed to take forever as she hit nearly every red light. Cursing herself for not having set an alarm to leave earlier she rushed into the restaurant 10 minutes late. A little out of breath, she caught sight of Rio seated across the room. As she made her way over the woman rose to greet her. If Agatha thought she had been attracted to her before the mere sight of her now left her drooling. Tonight she had opted for a dark green fitted dress with spaghetti straps and a plunging neckline. Her dark hair curled into waves like an old movie star and those honey amber eyes gleaming from behind a swoop of hair. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well if you aren’t absolutely stunning!” Rio gleamed as she helped Agatha into her chair. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not half bad yourself! I never would have expected this.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well it’s our first dinner together, I figured I’d pull out all the stops.” She winked. “Oh, and here you are my dear.” Rio handed over a single stemmed rose.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How lovely” Agatha fumbled with the flower, not really knowing where to put it until finally opting to hold it in her lap. She looked back at Rio suddenly puzzled. “So, you drove here on your motorcycle, in that?” This produced a roaring laugh from Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Absolutely not! It took way too much time to get ready for that!” She giggled “I took an Uber. What about you, any trouble getting here?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just running later than I planned. It’s been a long week.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tell me about it! Today couldn’t come soon enough! I’ve been looking forward to seeing you again since our last date. Have you had a chance to read any of your book?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A bit. I’ve not read a lot of fantasy but so far it’s piqued my interest. Excited to see how it turns out. What about you? How’s your adventure going?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Better than expected for me. Worst than expected for them. But that’s what you get when you’re arrogant about exploring the arctic. Really enjoying the firsthand perspective, you can really see where they went off the rails. So tell me about these friends of yours!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh Jen and Ralph I’ve known since college. Alice is Jen’s new girlfriend. Ralph is currently staying with me while he’s in town. He’s usually on the road or on some cruise ship or something. Jen, well Jen actually works at your hospital.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh no way! What department?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s a nurse midwife in labor and delivery. To be honest I’d be surprised if she hasn’t happened to introduce herself to you already. She’s particularly nosey.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I don’t think I’ve met a Jen. But then again, I’ve met a lot of people recently and don’t remember half of them unless I see them on a daily basis.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How’s your aunt doing?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s doing well. I told her about you, ya know.” She flashed Agatha her signature smirk</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, and what did she have to say?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I should be on my best behavior, so as not to scare you off.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t think that’s possible.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh really?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You may have had me flustered last time but I don’t scare easily. Even with your reckless driving.” she smiled slyly at Rio </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So you admit it, I made you nervous?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You, the situation, all foreign territory for me. You’re very… intense.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going to take that as a compliment. You mentioned that last time… it’s been..a while. So, who was she?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha choked on her wine, her eyes going wide with panic. She hadn’t planned on discussing Wanda for as long as possible, but of course Rio knew exactly what question she didn’t want to answer. She took another sip of her wine as Rio sat there patiently waiting for a response. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I…um…well she was.” She began to stutter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s fine, take your time. I expect this isn’t an easy subject for you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, you don’t go 7 years without dating if it wasn’t at least a little traumatic.” she chuckled, getting a smile out of Rio. This brief joy settled quickly into an uncomfortable silence as they sat there once again, the hum of anticipation between them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Her name was Wanda.” Agatha managed to whisper through a shy smile, a twinge of pain in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wanda.” Rio echoed softly. “How did you two meet?” Again she waited patiently for a reply. Agatha could feel her chest start to tighten as those memories began to rush back. She took a few breaths to settle the tears beginning to form and cleared her throat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We..uh…we met in school.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tell me about her. What was she like?” Agatha let out a breathy chuckle. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you really want to talk about this?” She deflected. Rio shot back a caring smile</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do.” She sat back in her chair savoring her wine. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She was definitely a bit of a risk taker. Always kept me on my toes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You seem to have a type!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What can I say, I like the bad boys.” She shrugged before taking another drink “but she was unnervingly kind and thoughtful. She cared deeply about the people she loved. She was overwhelmingly curious, one might say to a fault, and she was nearly unstoppable.” Agatha trailed off with a wistful sigh, a distant gaze clouding her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She sounds amazing. How long were you together?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well we dated for 5 years and were married for about the same.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I see…How did you lose her.” Agatha’s breath caught in her throat. She knew the question was inevitable, given Rio’s directness, but it still caught her off guard and tears began to fill the corners of her eyes. She attempted a smile, blinking them away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well…she was…overcome by curiosity and adventure. I’m sure much like the explorers in your novel, only a little less polar.” She danced around the severity of the tragedy hoping not to step on any unhealed wounds within her. She did not need to come apart on this date. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It was…unexpected.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Death often is. I’m sorry for your loss.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio reached across the table to hold Agatha’s hand. The soft warmth of her touch and the caring look of understanding created a small crack in the facade Agatha was trying desperately to uphold, allowing for a few tears to break free. She quickly pulled back and wiped them from her face as their food arrived. Thankful for the distraction, she took the opportunity to gather herself and nudge the conversation in a different direction. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So enough about me, part of this deal is I get to know you. For all I know you could be a serial killer.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I could be! You’ll have to find out.” She winked, “What do you want to know?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have you ever been in a committed relationship?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“A few.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And by a few you mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’d say 3 of them were pretty serious, a couple of them lasted longer than they should have. The rest were just convenient dalliances.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How many overall?” Agatha raised her eyebrows. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“30? 40? Probably more, I lost count.” Agatha’s eyes bulged as she took a bite of her food. Rio chuckled</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I take it your love life hasn’t been as prolific. Even before Wanda?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“There may have been a few others but no not nearly that many.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well luckily for you it’s equipped me with a breadth of knowledge and experience I’m sure you’ll want to take advantage of… at some point.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her cheeky smile was beaming again. Agatha was grateful for how quickly the levity had returned. Rio somehow had the ability to pull from her some of her darkest moments and still end up making her feel as if she was glowing from the inside out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“When was your last serious relationship?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“About 4 years ago. I thought I was going to marry this woman but found out she had been cheating on me. For a while.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my gods. I’m so sorry, that’s awful!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was for the best, really dodged a bullet there. So how many dates before I get to hear you sing?” Agatha rolled her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Something tells me you're not going to let that go anytime soon.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not until I get that concert you promised.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I promised nothing!” She said in mock defiance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was implied when you bragged about your karaoke skills. Come on! I bet you’re amazing.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am </span>
<em>
<span>very </span>
</em>
<span>good.” She taunted “We’ll have to see, when you’ve earned that privilege.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll beg if I have to! You’re not getting out of this so easily!” She wagged a frustrated finger at Agatha. As they took a moment to eat Agatha let her mind wander at that last comment. </span>
<em>
<span>I’ll beg if I have to</span>
</em>
<span>. Images of Rio danced across her mind, on her knees before her. The dress she was wearing ripped from her body, her big doe eyes looking up at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What are you thinking about?” The question startled her from her daydream. She cleared her throat as she composed herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well…um… why? Why did you choose this field of medicine? Neonatal surgeon, it seems pretty specialized.” Rio grinned in response, knowing full well that was not what Agatha had been thinking about. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure.” She chuckled “I kind of fell into it to be honest. I knew I wanted to be a surgeon. I was lucky enough to have a brilliant mentor who was a pediatric surgeon and I enjoyed working with the kids. There was one case I sat in on though that made me realize this is what I wanted to do.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, do tell.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you squeamish?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t think so.” She said cautiously </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I won’t get into anything too graphic but, I was able to observe a spina bifida repair on a fetus. It was quite successful and the baby was born with minimal complications a few months later. It completely changed the trajectory of that child’s life before it was even born.” Agatha sat there stunned for a moment. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s incredible.” She finally uttered “Is that…do you do a lot of those now?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“In-utero isn’t as common, we avoid it if possible. Much of the work is done right after birth, which makes it hard to plan for.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How so?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Babies run on their own schedule and it’s best to let them cook as long as possible unless it’s an emergency. The good thing is most of the time we know what to expect and prepare for when the time comes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How do you deal with that kind of stress? I can’t imagine working under that kind of pressure!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not easy, that’s for sure! Outside of the work that needs to be done, you can’t think about it too much. Live in the moment, surround yourself with good company, find ways to stay physically active.” She ended with a wink. Agatha looked down at her plate of food, chewing over the question she wanted to ask. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Have…have you ever… lost a patient?” There was silence as their eyes met once again. Rio, seeing the glimpse of sorrow and worry in Agatha’s eyes, cautiously responded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes.” Agatha’s breath caught in her throat as she was once again fighting back the tears threatening to spill over. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How?” She whispered. Rio looked down, picking at her plate, searching for how she wanted to reply. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sometimes… it’s just not meant to be. Life is eternally fragile, especially at the very start. You can do everything in your power and it won’t be enough.” Agatha could feel every bit of weight in what Rio had shared threatening to crush her. “I’m just lucky enough to be in position to try. Besides, I am quite good at what I do so those cases are few and far between.” At that Agatha let out a breath she didn’t realize she was holding and took a drink of her wine. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We can talk about something else if you prefer, this isn’t exactly light dinner conversation.” Agatha nodded silently “So when did you know you liked women?” Rio asked</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Probably since I was 13?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tell me more” Agatha laughed at the memory. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“There was this girl in my class. I wanted to be her friend so bad but she never gave me the time of day. I even tried dating her brother to get close to her but that didn’t end well. I ended up breaking his nose when he tried to make out with me on their couch. At the time I didn’t realize I was attracted to her like that but looking back it was pretty obvious. What about you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve always kind of known. My first kiss was with the neighbor girl in Puerto Rico.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How old were you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe 6? We were playing pretend wedding and there was no groom so I happily volunteered.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What did your parents think?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I never really got to have that conversation with my father. I think my mother had her suspicions. My aunt got the brunt of it when I hit puberty. I did not let that woman rest!” She laughed </span>
</p><p>
<span>“But she was ok with it? With you being gay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“More or less, she was more upset with how many of my female classmates I convinced to play doctor.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How old were you then?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“14? 15? When did you kiss your first girl?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grimaced “16. It was simultaneously the best and worst moment of my life.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, how so?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, everything I had been feeling finally clicked, and it finally felt right. But my mother quickly found out and you know the rest. Conversion camp, boarding school.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So is she super religious or something?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Southern Baptist actually. Lots of fire and brimstone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah, are you religious?” At that Agatha let out a bursting laugh. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Absolutely not! Growing up in that environment really beat it out of me. Are you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not particularly, I’d say I’m more spiritual.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What does that mean? Tarot and crystals and stuff?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah along those lines. My aunt is basically a witch and I tend to take after her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re a witch?” Agatha questioned, eyebrows raised. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eh, more or less. I certainly manifested you!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh really?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe I had a little help from my aunt. She anticipated you about a month before I actually met you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She read it in my cards. Have you ever had your tarot read?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, can’t say that I have.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well we definitely have to change that!” By this point the waiter had brought their bill. Rio didn’t give Agatha a chance to even try and pay before handing the bill back to the waiter with her card. “So, any chance you’d like to continue the night?” She said as she signed the check. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What did you have in mind?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well someone at work told me about this speakeasy type bar not far from here. Apparently they have live jazz on the weekends. We could have a few drinks, get dessert?” Agatha paused for a moment, contemplating with her face scrunched up to one side. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How far is it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A few blocks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Am I driving or are we walking?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We can take a Lyft if you’d like?” Agatha bit her lip. Exhaustion was pulling at her once again, but she was having such a good time and didn’t want to let the date end. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright lets do it!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As they rose from the table she suddenly realized how badly she needed to pee. “I’ll meet you out front, I have to go to the bathroom.” She rushed through the restaurant, nearly knocking over a waiter as she barreled into the restroom. She breezed past the few women waiting as a stall opened and she forced her way in. She barely made it to the seat before she expelled the contents of her bladder. She couldn’t remember ever having to pee so bad before in her life. Feeling lighter she exited the stall to glares from the many women still waiting. She calmly washed her hands and touched herself up in the mirror before heading out to meet Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did you make it?” She laughed</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Barely” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good, you’re just in time. Here’s our car.” As they settled into the car Rio reached out and grabbed Agatha’s hand, planting a kiss on her knuckles, before returning both their hands to her lap. The ride was only a few minutes as Agatha sat back and observed Rio glancing out the window watching the streetlights go by. She was probably the most intelligent, grounded woman she had ever met, yet she had such childlike awe for the world around her. </span>
<em>
<span>She was definitely the most beautiful she had ever met.</span>
</em>
<span> At that thought she felt a pang of guilt ring in her chest. Wanda. She loved Wanda, and Wanda had been beautiful, though in a more classic sense. Elegant, soft, delicate. She </span>
<em>
<span>had</span>
</em>
<span> loved Wanda, and Wanda was gone. Her feelings now for Rio did not negate all she had felt for Wanda but the pang of guilt was still ever present. She started to pull her hand away when Rio turned to look at her, that signature smirk on her face, those burning amber eyes. She could feel the heat from Rio’s gaze engulfing the guilt hovering in her chest and replacing that with desire. Without saying a word she repositioned her hand on Agatha’s and pulled it in closer then resumed looking out the window. Moments later they pulled up to a simple wooden door, a green light casting the only glow on that part of the street. Rio excitedly opened the door and pulled Agatha through. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You sure this is it?” She asked</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Definitely! It looks just like the pictures they showed me.” Rio walked up and knocked on the door. A little window slid open and a man popped out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you have a reservation?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, under Vidal.” Rio replied, turning to bashfully shrug at Agatha. “So I may have had this planned the whole time, I’m glad you agreed to go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Would you still have come here if I had said no?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Probably but only to drink my sorrows away at your absence.” Agatha rolled her eyes yet an undeniable smirk grew across her face. Eventually the door opened and they entered a long hallway. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Walk down to the elevator at the end and you’ll head down to the fourth floor.” The man instructed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Down?” Agatha looked at Rio concerned</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Down!” She replied eagerly as she led her down the hallway. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They pushed the button and waited for what felt like ages before the elevator arrived. They entered and pushed the only other available button, 4th floor. The doors creaked closed and the elevator slowly descended. Agatha leaned her back against the wall, taking some pressure off her aching feet. Rio sidled up to her and swung an arm around her waist pulling her into her side. Agatha looked over at her aching to rest her head on her shoulder but she didn’t want to appear as tired as she really was. Before they knew it the elevator landed and the doors glided back revealing an arched brick hallway lined with gas lamps, another door at the end. They glanced at each other concerningly as they slowly made their way toward the door. As they got closer they could hear muffled voices and the hum of the band. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do we knock again?” Agatha asked</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t think so.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As Rio reached for the handle the door burst open and they jumped back as another couple headed out. When they peered in they were taken aback by a large dome shaped room, much like a small theatre. There were tiered rows of round covered tables, each lit with a small lantern, leading down to a dance floor in front of a modest stage where the band was situated. Around the back of the room where they stood was an intricate wood and golden bar that wrapped around the whole level. Each of the waitstaff was dressed in some sort of 1920s attire. The big swing band playing added to the vintage atmosphere. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you want to grab a drink and walk around a bit or go find our table?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I would love to sit for a bit.” They wandered over to the host stand where they were led to a table right above the dance floor. Once seated Agatha let out a big sigh. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You alright?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, yes. Just a long day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I won’t keep you out too late! Maybe we just get one drink and head out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, that sounds good.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“ I just wanted to check it out for a bit. I’m just glad to be here with you.” Rio reached out, grabbing her hand once again and planting another kiss. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can I get you anything to drink or eat?” The server had popped up out of nowhere. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll take a manhattan.” Rio replied then motioned to Agatha</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll just take a water. But what desserts do you have?” The server rattled off a few, in the end she opted for a molten chocolate cake. She turned to Rio. “I’m so glad they have dessert. If I don’t eat something chocolate in the next 5 minutes I might combust!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have a sweet tooth?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Occasionally, but when I do it’s pretty severe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is it primarily chocolate or are there other sweets you indulge in?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Chocolate for sure but only as like a pastry. And really any pastry or baked good. I do really like tart or sour gummy candies as well. What about you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love a good red hot. Malted milk balls are also amazing. And those hard strawberry candies.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have the palate of an octogenarian.” She laughed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What can I say, I like what I like. That’s what Lilia usually keeps around her house.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lilia? Oh, your aunt?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, she’s usually got a bag of something stashed somewhere.” At that moment her dessert and their drinks arrived. She was practically salivating as they placed the plate in front of her with two spoons. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, do you want some?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I’m good you go ahead.” Agatha was two bites in before Rio had finished the sentence. In the blink of an eye the cake was gone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“WOW! You really put that away.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I needed that!” She huffed, a little breathless. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You certainly did!” Rio chuckled. Agatha leaned back against the chair, a hand on her chest,</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You ok?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine, just a little bit of heartburn. Maybe I should have gone slower on the cake.” She took a gulp of water as Rio stood up from her seat. “Where are you off to?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going to run to the restroom, I’ll be right back.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha relaxed there for a moment, taking in the atmosphere. She never would have come here on her own. If it wasn’t for Rio she never would have known this place existed. The hum in the air as mumbled conversations flowed under the music. The vibrancy of the people dancing to the music. That cake. All things she would never have experienced without having met this woman. She took the time to soak it in, giving herself permission to enjoy it. Before she knew it there was a tap on her shoulder. She turned around to find Rio holding out her hand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“My lady, may I have this dance?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t dance like this!” She snorted</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t either!” She patiently held out her hand before giving Agatha a judgmental look. “Come on, it’ll be fun!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She cautiously took her hand as Rio led her down to the dance floor. The music was a bit up beat and the people around them were spinning and twirling together. Agatha looked around nervously as they settled into a space. Rio took her right hand and guided Agatha’s left to her shoulder before placing it around her waist. Her left hand picked up Agatha’s other hand and held it out to their side. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Rio hummed, pulling Agatha’s eyes to her. “Just look at me ok? I got you.” Agatha’s gaze locked on to Rio as she led them around the floor. Despite Agatha’s two left feet, Rio managed to guide them gracefully around the other couples. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think you lied to me!” She said cheekily</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh really?” Rio replied, feigning shock</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are quite light on your feet!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You caught me! I’ll admit, I’m a pretty good dancer. So is Lilia so you better pick up quick!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is that who you learned it from?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh yes! She took me to all her dance classes.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The upbeat song ended and the band picked back up with a slower tune. Rio pulled her in closer, letting their hands rest on her shoulder, their faces just inches apart. They danced there quietly for a while staring into each other's eyes. Rio’s scent enveloped her once again causing her heart to quicken. Eventually Rio leaned forward, resting the side of her head against Agatha’s. In the soft press of their cheeks Agatha felt herself relax. She reveled in the embrace that cradled her, feeling the heat of their bodies pressing together. The hand wrapped around her waist slowly drifted to her lower back sending sparks through her body along the way. She drew back a bit, her gaze drifting between Rio’s eyes and her pillowy lips. She could feel the tension tingling between them as the song came to an end. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You ready to get out of here?” Rio muttered, her eyes twinkling. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah” Agatha smiled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio led them off the dance floor, down the hallway and back to the elevator where they waited with a few other couples. They stood there waiting with their fingers entwined, chancing quick looks at one another. As they entered Agatha wished they had the journey up all to themselves like on the way down. The heat now growing inside her was becoming impatient and she wanted nothing more than to feel Rio’s soft lips against hers. For now that would have to wait. As soon as they were outside Rio leaned over. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, care to share a ride back to your car?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’d like that.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They didn’t wait long before a Lyft picked them up. The journey back somehow seemed longer than before. Rio’s attention was no longer on the world outside but on Agatha, taking in every bit of her. She caressed her hand, turning it over and gently glided along each finger. The delicate touches further feeding the hunger burning inside her now. At last they arrived back at the restaurant and to Agatha’s car where they both got out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hold on a sec, I’ll be right back.” Rio shouted to the driver following Agatha to her car.  Agatha felt a pit rise in her stomach. Though she knew the night was ending she didn’t want to let Rio go. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So any chance I’ve earned another date?” Rio said somewhat sheepishly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, most definitely” Agatha beamed, her back resting against her car. Rio moved in closer, once again gathering Agatha’s hands. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I had an amazing time tonight.” She looked up into Agatha's eyes,  her gaze flitting between them and her mouth. The heat building inside Agatha was reaching a boiling point, the space between them growing ever closer. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Me too” she hummed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Before she knew it Rio’s lips were pressed against hers. Their silky softness tinged with the smoky bitterness of the manhattan that still lingered. As their lips gently caressed one another the hunger between them began to build. Agatha dove deeper reaching up to grab Rio’s face pulling it further into her, her fingers entwining in her hair. Rio snaked her arms around Agatha’s waist pushing her back against the car as she devoured the woman before her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Honk Honk </span>
</em>
<span>- the driver, growing impatient, laid on his horn breaking their intimacy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Annoyed, Rio broke the kiss. “Give me a second! Can’t you see we’re having a moment here!” She shouted </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know I could just drive you home.” Agatha huffed breathlessly. “If you want.” Rio spun around raising an eyebrow. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You sure?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh-huh” Agatha panted biting her lip. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“On second thought,” Rio shouted as she walked over to the driver, tipped him handsomely, and sent him on his way. Agatha made her way over to the passenger door opening it for Rio. As she leaned into the car Rio planted another quick kiss on Agatha’s lips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks doll!” She winked and pulled the door closed. By the time she started the car Rio had the directions set to her place. A short, 15 minute drive to the other side of the city. As they pulled out of the parking lot Rio began fumbling with her audio controls. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you normally listen to?” She asked as she skipped through different radio stations. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I don’t really.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t listen to anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My mind is usually racing so I use driving time to sort out my thoughts. Also, I don’t really spend that much time in my car to worry about it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Huh.” Rio huffed amused as she turned on a 70s playlist. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The rest of the short journey was silent except for the music, both of them feeling the weight of the late hour upon them. Rio sleepily gazed at Agatha as she drove, eventually letting her hand wander to rest on Agatha’s thigh. As soon as she felt the light touch a heat began to rise from that point crawling up her body to rest in her core. She could feel her heartbeat quicken and chanced a look at the woman beside her. Rio’s eyes were soft and heavy yet her usual fire still burned deep within them. That sultry gaze only intensified the heat building in her, rising to her chest. Moments later they pulled up to what appeared to be a schoolhouse taking up the entire block. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Am I at the right place?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah” Rio giggled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You live in a school?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well it’s not a school anymore, they converted it into apartments.” Agatha looked puzzled. “Do you want to come see?” Rio asked as she tried to hide her smirk. She looked at the clock, almost 11. She could go up for a few minutes just to see what it was like then head home. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright.” Rio exited the vehicle and came around to open Agatha’s door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just don’t judge me, I haven’t had a chance to clean up.” She smiled as she held out her hand for Agatha. When she stood to get out her legs wobbled as a pain shot through her feet. “Woah! You good?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah” she winced. “My feet are killing me!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well let’s get you inside and off your feet.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She wrapped an arm around Agatha’s waist supporting her as they went inside. The building itself was old, from around the 1910s and still featured much of the original ornate architecture. The main lobby still felt much like a school. Off to the right was a glass encased room which at one point must have served as administrative offices. The walls featured intricate portraits of former principals dating back to the inception of the school. Straight ahead was an imperial wooden staircase leading to a landing hosting arched stained glass windows that rose to the ceiling of the second floor. Between the stairs on the first floor was a long hallway lined with lockers and drinking fountains halfway down. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you sure we didn’t just break into a school?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah!” She laughed again “They left the entry like this as part of the aesthetic. This way!” She followed Rio to the right just before the stairs to the elevator and pressed the button. Almost immediately the doors opened to a person holding a basket of laundry. “Hey Kris!” Rio said as they entered the elevator. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey” said a bleary eyed Kris who leaned back against the wall closing their eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They rode up in silence letting Kris exit before making their way down the hallway to the right. The floors were restored original hardwood matching the grand staircase below. The walls were split by wainscoting matching the original wood on the bottom and featuring dark green floral wallpaper on top. They passed a few wooden doors before reaching the end of the hallway where Rio stopped. Apt. 4 was etched in gold and black lettering on the glass of the frosted window pane that hung in the doorframe. She dug around in her bag for a moment before pulling out an antique iron key. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I thought you said this place was renovated!” She teased</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is, they preserved as much of the original structure as they could, but most everything inside is updated and reconfigured.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>At last she unlocked the door, swinging it open to a small entryway. Immediately to the left were a set of 3 large wooden cubbies built in. Each with a place to sit and hooks for what must have been backpacks at some point. Rio motioned for Agatha to sit and remove her shoes as she closed the door behind them. She took a moment to glance around the space. Directly in front of the cubbies they had built out a small half bathroom enclosing the entryway a bit. Past that the room opened up to a large kitchen with an island to the right and an open living room area across from that. The brick walls were punctuated by large black mullioned windows each surrounded by a hoard of various plants. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Care for the grand tour?” Rio called out as she threw her bag on the counter and kicked off her shoes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure.” Agatha said as she made her way further in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So each apartment is made up of 2 former classrooms and my bathroom was definitely the boys bathroom at some point. If you look to your left you’ll see the living room which is essentially where the first classroom was.” The room was fitted with a large oriental rug covering much of the wooden floors. A dark brown leather u-shaped sectional was at the center of the room surrounding a wood and glass coffee table. Along the left and back wall were floor to ceiling built-in bookcases with a sliding ladder. Some books peppered the shelves but there were several unopened moving boxes scattered about. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The bookcases were originally in the library which they converted into two story condos. Do you wanna see what I’ve found carved into some of the shelves?” Agatha nodded and followed her over to the first shelf as she knelt down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right here…” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Math is a tempestuous lover</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Huh, not what I was expecting.” Agatha chuckled</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then there’s this one over here…” she walked over and pointed out another mark. This one was a crescent moon with three shooting stars behind it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How charming!” She remarked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But this one is my favorite…” She pushed the ladder to the end, “You'll want to look to the right on the top shelf.” Rio held the ladder steady as Agatha ascended a few steps. She leaned in looking to the right finding what looked like a carving of a butt and the words </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Mrs. Martin is a buttface</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a laugh, “This is more what I was expecting!” She turned to look down at Rio. She held the ladder steady with both arms, her big doe eyes studying her, with a large smile plastered on her face. Agatha couldn’t help it, but at that angle she also saw right down the front of her dress. She blushed before quickly turning around and heading down the ladder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“This way to the kitchen. This is where the second classroom started, you can see where they took down this part of the dividing wall. Can I get you anything to drink?” She headed over to the fridge where she grabbed a soda water. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“One of those would be great.” Rio handed over the beverage before heading down the short hallway. They stopped as they got to a wooden door with a frosted glass pane on the left. Rio swung the door open and flicked on the light revealing a large walk-in pantry with built-in wooden shelving. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“This is the largest pantry I’ve seen, let alone one for an apartment.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, it’s bigger than that hall bathroom. There is a hookup for a washer dryer which I need to get at some point. I’m already tired of going to the basement to do my laundry.” She led them out and closed the door. “Now, the bedroom!” She led them to the doorway at the end and stopped as she was about to open it. “Again, don’t judge. I only moved in like 2 weeks ago.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She slowly opened the door revealing the room filled with boxes, and clothes, half hung up and half in piles around the room. Along the right wall were more bookshelves but they had been converted into an open closet. The queen sized bed was fitted with black silk sheets and a green comforter that was held aloft on a wooden frame that you had to step on to get to the bed like a platform. On the wall behind the bed remained a large chalkboard. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“This really was a classroom!” She said as she cautiously entered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hehe yeah, I am definitely going to get some chalk and use that. It’s too cool not to!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wouldn’t that get messy?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Probably.” She shrugged. “ Come on, you've got to see the bathroom!” She waved her over to the doorway at the back of the room. As she flipped on the light Agatha took in the tile covered room. The whole left side of the room was sectioned off as an enormous walk-in shower with multiple shower heads. Straight ahead was a large double vanity and mirror. To the right was a toilet and a urinal? </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh! The boys bathroom.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hehe, yeah” Rio beamed. “Home sweet home! So you want to hang out for a bit? Or, I know it’s getting late.” For the first time Rio seemed sheepish. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It </span>
<em>
<span>is </span>
</em>
<span>getting late.” At that Rio looked down pondering her feet, seemingly disappointed. “But I can stay at least until I finish this drink.” Rio looked back at Agatha beaming. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on, I promised I’d get you off your feet.” She led her back to the living room, settling down in the middle of the couch. Agatha settled in the corner letting out a sigh as soon as she sat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is it the shoes?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Huh?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Were the shoes making your feet hurt?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, yeah, they weren’t the most comfortable but also my ankles and joints have just been sore lately.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe I can help?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How so?” She let out an amused huff</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you want I could rub your feet?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You want to rub my feet?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If it’ll help.” Agatha mulled it over for a moment. The idea of it seemed intimate and she wasn’t sure how she felt about that. But her feet were aching at this point. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright.” She decided and stretched her legs out to rest her feet in Rio's lap. Her nimble fingers wrapped themselves around her foot and began to knead at the sore spots. Almost immediately Agatha could feel her whole body relaxing into the sensation. She let her eyes flutter closed and leaned her head against her hand propped up on the couch. Minutes passed in peaceful silence before Rio looked up catching Agatha dozing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey! You gonna be ok to drive home?” She chuckled as she attempted to shake her awake. Agatha let out a sleepy grumble before settling down further into the couch. “I’ll take that as a no then.” She slowly removed herself from beneath Agatha’s legs and went in search of a blanket. She rifled through a few boxes, coming up empty handed. In the end she grabbed her comforter from her bed, brought it over and wrapped it around Agatha before heading to bed herself.</span>

<span>As the morning light filtered in through the large windows Agatha began to stir. She rolled over gathering the covers around her taking a deep breath in. Immediately her eyes popped open and she took in her surroundings. She was still in Rio’s apartment. She had fallen asleep on her couch. She lay there for a moment as panic and embarrassment filled her chest. Then she heard rustling in the kitchen and the smell of coffee began to fill the air. She slowly raised herself to her elbows and peered over the back of the couch. She caught sight of Rio in the kitchen rifling through cabinets and pulling out coffee mugs and other supplies. She was in grey sweatpants and a black hoodie with the hood pulled up, clearly having also just woken up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha laid back down and threw her hands over her face. How could she have done this? She barely knew the woman, this was only their second date. It had been a good date though. A </span>
<em>
<span>really </span>
</em>
<span>good date. She couldn’t remember the last time she had such a good time. Her heart warmed at the memory of the night before. Then it developed into more of a burning situation. Ugh, another morning waking up with heartburn. She had to bite the bullet and get up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She slowly moved the covers off of her trying to make as little noise as possible. Hearing no other noise than the coffee maker she took another look into the kitchen, Rio was nowhere to be found, now was her chance. She rose from the couch and tiptoe ran to the entryway to put on her shoes. She grabbed her purse and quickly checked her phone </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Ralph - messages (10)</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Ralph - missed calls(3)</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Jen - messages(2)</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Jen - missed calls(2)</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Shit! She was never going to hear the end of it from either of them. She stood up to open the door just as she heard, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Going so soon?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Startled, she yelped as she turned around to find Rio leaning against the wall, mug of coffee in hand. Her face was alight with that devilish smirk. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sorry, didn’t mean to scare you.” She chuckled. Agatha’s heart was still in her throat as she choked out, “Oh…no…it’s, I’m fine… just wasn’t expecting you to sneak up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t let me stop you if there’s somewhere you need to be, but I do have coffee ready if you want some. I’d offer you more but I haven’t really been grocery shopping recently.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha let out an airy laugh. She thought of how she must look, disheveled in a wrinkled mess of a dress from the night before. She could feel her makeup in places she didn’t put it. Who knew what state her hair was in. Yet this woman wanted her to stay and frankly she needed more time to wake up before she started driving home. What could one cup of coffee hurt?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why not?!” She exclaimed, throwing her hands out to the side. She followed Rio back into the kitchen </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I have cream, sugar, or vanilla creamer if you prefer.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Vanilla creamer would be great.” Rio handed her a mug warm with coffee and then grabbed the creamer from the fridge handing her that and a spoon. She took a seat on the singular stool as she fixed her cup. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So?” Rio said as she leaned across the counter toward Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So?” Agatha replied, eyes wide with uncertainty. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are </span>
<em>
<span>you </span>
</em>
<span>up to today?” Rio’s smile returned as she brought the mug up to her lips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, not much. Some housework, laundry. You?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m on call this afternoon but I’m free all morning. You hungry?” At the mention of food Agatha’s stomach grumbled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now that you mention it…” She was cut short by her phone ringing. Ralph. She bit her lip before answering the call. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hello?” She chirped in a sing-song voice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“HELLO?! HELLO?! You go radio silent as soon as you leave the house, no text, no call! I was convinced she had you in a freezer somewhere! Oh, you goddamn bitch! I was this close to calling the police.” Ralph’s tirade burst forth through the phone. “Where are you?” He demanded. Agatha let out a nervous laugh, flashing a smile at Rio who was leaning against the counter enjoying the show. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I…uh…I’m at her place.” She muttered as she turned away from Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re what?!” He exclaimed </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m at her apartment.” She grumbled through gritted teeth. “We’ll talk about it later. I’ll let you know when I’m headed back.” She quickly hung up the phone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“He seemed flustered!” Rio commented, a cheeky grin on her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He usually is.” She shrugged. “So, you mentioned something about food?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah if you’re up for it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know that I’m quite, put together enough, to go out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I could go grab us some breakfast, or you’re welcome to use my bathroom to get ready.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“More than anything I would love to get out of this dress. It’s terribly uncomfortable!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s do this, I’ll go out and get us something to eat. You make yourself at home, feel free to take a shower or whatever and you’re welcome to borrow whatever you like from the closet.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You trust me alone in your house?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re welcome to snoop, though if you go through any of the boxes, just go ahead and unpack it. It will save me so much time.” She joked. “So do you have a preference or I can surprise you if you prefer?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was so hungry she couldn’t think of what she wanted to eat. “Surprise me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Excellent! Savory or sweet?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Savory.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Anything specific I should stay away from?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I could eat just about anything right now.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Awesome, I know exactly what we’re gonna get! I’ll head out, should be about 45 mins and I’ll be back. I left you a toothbrush and a towel in the bathroom.”  She leaned over and kissed Agatha on the cheek before heading out the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sat in silence for a moment in stunned disbelief, not quite sure what to do with herself. Despite this being their 2nd date, </span>
<em>
<span>or was it 3rd at this point</span>
</em>
<span>, everything with Rio felt so natural and easy. Before she could stew in her stupor for too long her phone rang again. This time it was Jen. She was not dealing with </span>
<em>
<span>that </span>
</em>
<span>right now. She silenced her phone, took a sip of her coffee and headed to the bathroom. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She immediately stripped off her dress and got in the shower. It took her a moment to figure out which handle got her hot water but once she did she felt her aches and pains melt away. The eucalyptus hanging from the shower head filled her lungs, waking and refreshing her. She could have stayed there for hours. When she did finally turn the water off and wrap herself in the towel Rio provided she could feel how sore she really was. Despite how comfortable the couch had been she still felt the twinges of having not slept in a proper bed. Even her chest was sore, likely from having slept in the tight dress, she reasoned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Now wrapped in a towel, she ventured into Rio’s bedroom in search of a more comfortable outfit. Most of the clothes hanging and put away were work clothes. She figured that anything in the pile of clothes at the end of the bed was likely dirty and decided to sift through some of the boxes near the closet. The first one she opened was filled with socks, bras, and underwear. She quickly closed it, turning to the next box. This one held a few books as well as some framed diplomas. In the corner she spotted a few framed photos. She knelt down and pulled them out of the box. The first one was a photo of Rio at graduation holding up her diploma, an older woman squeezing her arms around her and giving her a kiss on the cheek. She was dressed rather eclectically with her wild curly hair pulled back in a high bun. This woman had to be Lilia, Rio’s aunt. The next photo was a much younger Rio wrestling with a young boy. She couldn’t have been more than nine or ten, he was maybe eight? She was in a white shirt with different colored trim around the neck and arms and jean shorts. Her baseball cap was on backward, nearly falling off her head as the boy, who had to be her brother, had his arms wrapped around her neck, his head leaning down onto it. The last photo was of her as a toddler. She was in a multi-colored dress, her short baby hair pulled into tiny pigtails. She was held by, who she assumed was her father, who was smiling at her while one of her tiny fingers reached out touching his nose. A pregnant woman, who had to be her mother, had her arms resting against the pair smiling up at them both. She could feel the pang of loss growing in her chest as tears began to fill her eyes. She sniffled, looking away before the tears could fall. She grabbed the photos and walked over to one of the closet shelves and arranged them there. She took a step back marveling at these precious memories. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After a moment she resumed looking for clothes, eventually finding a pair of yoga pants and a large band T to throw on. She went back and grabbed her clothes from the bathroom, setting them with her shoes at the door then headed back to her coffee. The liquid had cooled significantly but was still warm enough to be soothing. She grabbed the mug and meandered over to the large windows. In the daylight she could see that they overlooked a large courtyard garden and fountain. A few small trees were perched throughout the yard and there was a walking path that weaved around and through the garden. She had to admit, however odd it was that she lived in a school, it was quite a beautiful campus. Just then she heard the door open as Rio returned with their food. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sorry, that took a little longer than I expected. But it gave me time to grab these…” As she set the bag of food on the counter she untucked her other arm from behind her back revealing a small bouquet of flowers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, gods! You didn’t have to do that!” Agatha remarked as she grabbed the flowers, breathing in their delicious scent. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know, I wanted to.” Rio beamed back at her. “So, I went to The Biscuit House and got a little bit of everything so have at it!” She unpacked the boxes and laid them out across the counter as they began to eat. “So, find anything good while I was away?” She raised her eyebrows tauntingly at Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nothing incriminating.” She said with a smirk, “just some photos.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Too bad you didn’t find the toy box,” Rio winked, “we could have had some fun!” Agatha blushed and choked on the biscuit she just took a bite of. She grabbed her coffee, downing it to clear her throat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at her in amusement. “So after breakfast we could finish the tour if you’d like?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha breathed out a laugh “How are you not sick of me?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t help that you’re incredibly hot and I find you completely irresistible.” Rio shrugged, taking a bite of bacon. Agatha could feel her blush intensifying, spreading to her chest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know if I’ll ever get used to that.” She snickered, shaking her head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Used to what?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re very intense, it’s disarming.” She picked at the food in front of her before finally admitting, “I…don’t know that I’ve ever felt this way before.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hope that’s a good thing.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think so,” she smiled, “it’s just…caught me off guard. I wasn’t sure if I’d ever want to be in a relationship again. After everything. But now.” She glanced back up at Rio, “everything feels different.” Rio stood up from where she was leaning and walked over to stand right in front of Agatha. She looked up into Rio’s eyes which were illuminated with passion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I told you, this was fate. I knew I would win you over, one way or another.” She reached out, tucking a loose strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear as she bit her bottom lip. The familiar smell of earth and rain intensified as she brushed past and Agatha leaned into the touch. A spark went through her as Rio’s fingertips danced across her cheek. She chanced a look back into those big brown eyes. Big mistake! The fire now pooling in her belly was spreading quickly through the rest of her body. She couldn’t contain it any longer. Her hands reached out, pulling Rio’s face to her, devouring her in a kiss. Their teeth clashed together on impact as they each fought to consume the other. Rio’s passion won over as she pressed Agatha into the counter. She leaned her body in shifting herself between Agatha’s thighs. Agatha moaned, feeling a sudden rush of heat at the pressure, and pulled Rio further into her. Rio’s lips trailed away down her jawline and into the crook of her neck as her hands moved down, exploring her body. She threw her hands back grasping at the counter in an attempt to ground herself. She could feel the world around her spinning in a flurry of pleasure. It was becoming overwhelming, and uncomfortable in their current position. She pressed a hand between them pushing Rio back to where their foreheads were touching, both of them panting. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You ok? What’s wrong?” Rio gasped. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I'm fine…I just…need to slow it down for a bit.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh yeah. Right. Of course. Sorry about that.” She started to pull away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No need to apologize, I’m pretty sure I started it.” She grabbed Rio’s shirt and pulled her back in for one more kiss. “So, you mentioned something about finishing the tour?” she raised her eyebrows suggestively. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, if you’re still up for it?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think I have time to finish the tour but then I should definitely head back.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Absolutely! Wait right here.” Rio dashed off to her bedroom, returning shortly with a pair of flip flops. “Here, these will be more comfortable.” She dropped the shoes in front of Agatha and motioned for her to follow out the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio led them through the corridor until they wound their way back to the main entrance at the top of the grand staircase. With the daylight shining through the stained glass windows, the room was illuminated with prisms of color dancing across every surface. The view was breathtaking. Rio turned halfway down the stairs to marvel at Agatha’s dumbstruck awe that froze her in place. She rushed back to meet her, taking her hand. “Pretty magnificent isn’t it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You could say that again.” Agatha marveled as she let Rio guide her down the stairs. At the bottom they turned to head through the archway and down the hall with the lockers and drinking fountains. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Apparently this was founded as an all boys preparatory academy in the early 1900s. It expanded to include girls in the 1960s, though it’s not been a school since the late 2000s.” Rio stopped about halfway down the hallway at one of the lockers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sorry, just gotta check the mail really quick while we’re here.” She opened the door to find a handful of letters, all of which seemed to be junk mail. She closed the locker and threw the mail away in a nearby trash can as they continued down the hallway. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So I’m sure you saw the garden in the courtyard, we’ll definitely stop by there. But there are a couple other spaces I want to show you first.” She wound them down through different hallways before they ended up in a far corner. There were double doors on either side of the walls and a large marquee indicating the theatre. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Though they converted a few of the amenities into condos and apartments, like the library and cafeteria, they kept some of the communal spaces.” Rio opened a set of doors allowing Agatha to enter first. The long dark hallway opened up into a rather large theatre. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Apparently local groups rent it out for plays and musicals and stuff. They also show movies here on the weekends.” She turned mischievously toward Agatha. “I’ve heard they have karaoke nights every other Thursday. The next one is in two weeks.” Agatha rolled her eyes but couldn’t help the smirk that snuck onto her lips. “Any chance I could convince you to invite your friends? We can make a night of it!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, already planning our next date I see.” She huffed a laugh. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No!” Rio protested sarcastically “I should be able to sneak in a few more before then.” Agatha playfully shoved Rio who grabbed her hand and led her back out of the theatre. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright this way!” They headed down another hallway until they reached a stairway leading further down into the building. They descended a couple flights before reaching the bottom. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where are you taking me, the dungeon?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Only if you’re naughty” Rio winked. They continued on until they reached another set of doors, one indicating men, the other women. Rio intentionally pulled the door to the men’s side and pulled Agatha in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are we on the right side?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh it super doesn’t matter. No one gives a fuck. So far I’ve not seen many people down here. I think they’re a little creeped out.” Agatha had to admit, the locker room they had entered looked straight out of a sanatorium. Spacious and covered in floor to ceiling white tiles. There were locker bays off to the right and restrooms and showers up to the left. Rio hurried them through a door on the other side of the room. She was immediately hit with a wave of chlorine. The domed room housed what had to be an olympic sized swimming pool complete with diving boards. She walked down to meet Rio at the edge of the pool. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe next time you sleep over we can come down for a midnight swim?” She raised her eyebrows, tucking her tongue into the side of her cheek causing Agatha to blush once again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She then led Agatha around and out of the pool room through the other locker room. They climbed back up the stairwell and headed toward the center of the building. As they reached the end of the hallway they were headed down they arrived at a set of large wooden doors. Rio reached out, pulling one open for Agatha. This brought them to the garden she had seen from Rio’s apartment. Now, here at ground level, she could really take in the scale of the courtyard. It extended far to the other end of the building, about the size of a football field, perhaps slightly larger. The flowers and plants, though lush, were beginning to die off in the mid autumn air. The few trees that lined the space had turned into a lovely fall palette. She could smell the sweet breeze of dying leaves as they cut through the garden to the other side of the building, entering through another set of large wooden doors. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright, I promise this is the last stop.” She said as they reached the end of yet another hallway. She opened the door here revealing the gym. The school gym, complete with risers, and basketball hoops. The court was currently set with a volleyball net. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Apparently there’s a group that plays basketball on Mondays, I’m gonna try and join. Do you play?” Rio asked as she picked up a ball from the rack behind the hoop. Agatha laughed at the thought. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ha, absolutely not!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have you ever played?”</span>
</p><p><span>“I don’t believe I have.”</span><span><br/></span> <span>“You shouldn’t have said that! Now I’m obligated to at least teach you to shoot.” She walked over to Agatha, positioning her in front of the hoop. “Ok are you lefty or righty?”</span></p><p>
<span>“Left”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, hold your hand up like you’re carrying a tray or something. Great! Now you’re gonna want to think up and over, like this.” She demonstrated the move for her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, I think I got it.” She said rather confidently. Rio placed the ball in Agatha’s hand as she just stood there for a moment. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You can go whenever you’re ready.” She chuckled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I thought you were gonna say go or something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, just go.” she said, a laugh bubbling out of her. Agatha screwed her face to the side, concentrating on the motion Rio showed her. After a moment she launched her arm, sinking the ball in the first shot. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Woah!” Rio exclaimed. “Honestly, I didn’t expect that. You’re a natural.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What can I say, I’m exceptional.” She said, very self-satisfied, tossing her hair behind her shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, as much as it pains me, let’s get you back so you can go home.” Agatha too felt the pang of disappointment at the realization, it was indeed time to go. Though this had been the longest date she’d ever been on, she didn’t want it to end. She felt so natural and at ease with Rio, like the stress she carried with her each day was practically non-existent. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio guided them back to her apartment and headed straight to her room as Agatha began to gather her things. She returned with an empty duffle bag.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Here, for your things. Oh, and don’t forget your flowers.” She handed them back to Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know at this point I have a whole outfit of yours. I meant to bring your jacket back but I forgot it at my place.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh don’t worry about it! This way I’ll have something to wear the next day when I come to stay at your place.” She grinned like the Cheshire cat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll have to make sure it’s clean and ready for you then.” Agatha smiled seductively as she took a step closer to Rio. Rio responded in kind, moving forward as she reached a hand out and around Agatha’s waist. Agatha reached up, cupping Rio’s cheek and pulling her in for a lingering kiss. She could feel the burning heat of desire rising in her once again as Rio’s fingers dug into her hips pulling her deeper. She smiled against Rio’s lips, breaking the kiss and leaning back to look into her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You..uh…want me to walk you to your car?” Rio panted, breathless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bit her lip trying to hide her smile, as she nodded. Rio grabbed her things then led them out the door and down to Agatha’s car. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So, maybe we could meet up and go for a walk this week? Or we could meet for lunch?” Rio suggested as Agatha loaded her car. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, text me and let me know what works for you and we can find a time to get together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And, not to put any pressure on you, but Lilia is already asking when I’m going to bring you by.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sure we can work something out. I’d really like to meet her too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Gods you’re amazing! I’ve had such a great time with you.” Rio reached out, pulling Agatha close once again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have to admit, I’ve really enjoyed myself. Whatever spell you’re working, I think it’s starting to win me over.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh it’s just now starting to work?” She joked</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shut up!” Agatha breathed as she leaned in for one final kiss. “Alright, I do have to go!” she said as she started her car.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine, I’ll text you!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As she pulled away she saw Rio blow her another kiss before heading back inside. On the way home she figured she should touch base with Ralph. The phone barely rang once before Ralph’s voice echoed through the speakers of her car.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“AH! Bitch! Finally! Tell me everything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey Ralph, I’m headed home. Where are you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jen and I have been out shopping and should be headed back soon.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey Agatha! What, you only answer Ralph’s calls now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey Jen. No, I was busy when you called.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“OOOOO I bet you were. Seems like you’ve been very busy!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nothing happened! I just fell asleep.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right, which is why you’re not getting home until 11:30…the next morning!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whatever! You can interrogate me when you get home. I’ll be back in 15.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re a little further out but shouldn’t be back too much later. See you, love you! You better be ready to spill!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m girding my loins as we speak! See you soon.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She reflected in the silence since hanging up the phone and, for the first time, found it unnervingly quiet. She reached over to turn on the radio, finding a station playing 70s music. She couldn’t help but smile the rest of the way home, a warmth she hadn’t felt in ages filling her chest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As she pulled into the driveway she noticed a figure sitting on her porch swing. She groaned at the prospect of dealing with one of her mother’s congregants after the amazing time she just had. Shuffling out of the car she slammed the door, startling the person on the porch. They jumped before rising to head to her front door as she walked up to the house. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If you’re here about Jesus, I’ve found him, I know him, he and I are not friends and I like it that way.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha! Actually I’m here about your inheritance, as well as a personal matter. Oh, well don’t you look…comfortable.” She looked up to find none other than Christian. The pudgy, pig-faced lawyer her mother hired. Out of reflex she recoiled in disgust. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What the fuck are you doing here? How did you find my house?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your mother was kind enough to lend me the information. I happened to be in town on other business and thought I’d stop by and settle when we could find you in Boston.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Gods, you people are relentless. As I told my mother and my lawyer, it will happen when I can get to it.” She said as started to unlock her front door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you’re worried about getting time off, don’t. I reached out to Herb on your behalf and let him know of your situation. He was more than kind enough to let me know he'll give you all the time you need to sort your affairs.” She stopped suddenly, whipping around to face him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How fucking dare you! What kind of lawyer are you? That’s beyond inappropriate.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was just trying to make it easier for you to settle the property. I meant no offense. In fact I was hoping for quite the opposite.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve got to be joking.” she scowled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I’m afraid not. Your mother had told me so much about you before we met. Then seeing you in person I thought there was quite a connection.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw dropped “And what the hell gave you that idea?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I saw the looks you were giving me during dinner. And then you’ve been playing hard to get. Not responding to my calls or texts.” She rolled her eyes, dumbfounded that this idiot couldn’t tell she had been placating him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ugh, Newsflash! The look I was giving you was one of disgust. I’m not playing hard to get, I’m am just SO very uninterested. And honestly, at this point, I am seriously considering a restraining order.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So you wouldn’t want to get dinner this evening?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“NO!” she shouted at him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Would this get you to reconsider?” He walked over to the bench grabbing a sad bouquet of daisies. Agatha couldn’t look more disgusted if she tried. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Absolutely not!” She shouted as she held up the flowers Rio had given her. “Beyond the fact that I’m currently seeing someone, you are so not my type.” The man straightened up, beginning to look offended. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not into ruggedly handsome men?” he preened, puffing out his chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Clearly my mother didn’t tell you everything. I am not into men!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” He stuttered, shocked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m a big, fat, lesbian! I had a wife, who died, and I am currently dating a woman. I will </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> be interested in you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well maybe you just haven’t found the right man.” His voice tinged with a hint of anger and frustration as he inched closer to her. Clearly he didn’t hear the word no often enough and wasn’t going to take it. “You seem to be lost in sin. I think I might be able to change your mind and your soul, if you’d just give me a chance.” Clearly he wanted to get his ass beat and Agatha was more than happy to oblige. He reached out in an attempt to grab her hand and she swung, slapping him across the face. He stumbled back a bit in shock clutching his cheek. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You hit me!” The shock had quickly worn off, in its place rage. His eyes flashed with anger as he targeted Agatha. He took two large strides toward her, his fists balled in fury. Agatha, not one to be intimidated by an insecure man, charged back and swung her leg up to collide with his crotch. He doubled over in pain, lying on the floor of the porch gasping for air.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Holy Shit! Agatha are you ok? What the fuck just happened?” Ralph and Jen, having just arrived, rushed onto the porch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine. You might want to call an ambulance for this asshole. I may have dislodged one of his testicles.” She turned to head into her home slamming the door behind her. Jen and Ralph looked at the pitiful Christian lying on the floor then looked back at each other.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m not calling shit.” Jen stated as she stepped over Christian to follow Agatha into the house. Ralph leaned down to Christian who was writhing in agony. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re really lucky she didn’t have a knife dude.” He patted his shoulder and followed the others inside.</span>

<span>After the unfortunate encounter with Christian, Agatha reached out to her lawyer and finally set up a time to go out to Boston and settle this once and for all. She was tired of dealing with her mother’s antics and knew this would be the only way to shut her up for good. She planned to leave at the end of the month and gave herself a week there to settle things. In the meantime she had her lawyer get started on restraining orders for Christian and her mother. Evanora had crossed many lines and Agatha had had enough. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Later in the week she met up with Rio for a walk in the park between meetings and had the chance to regale her about her harrowing triumph over that imbecile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I probably would have killed him if I had been there.” Rio swung her arms about in mock karate moves. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh stop!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, in fact I’m plotting his murder as we speak. There’s no way he’s getting away with that shit!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh he’s definitely not! I heard he has a ruptured testicle.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Excellent work dear!” She kissed Agatha on the cheek, “Well at least we know he likely won’t be procreating. So, are we still on for Karaoke next week?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes and tried to hide the smirk that flitted across her lips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes.” she huffed, pretending to be annoyed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And your friends? Are they able to make it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh they’ll be there. They have been dying to meet you! Jen even traded shifts to make sure she and Alice could go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Excellent!” Rio rubbed her hands together plottingly. “Oh, and by the way, Lilia wanted me to check and see if you would want to come by for lunch on Sunday. Any chance you’re free?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This Sunday? I could probably make that work.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fantastic, I’ll let her know!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is there anything I should bring? I will warn you I’m a terrible cook.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you want to impress her, she loves a good wine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That I can do! What time should I be there?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll pick you up at noon?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“On that bike of yours? No, I want to look presentable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” She laughed, “I have a car.” Agatha stopped in stunned frustration.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you drove me around on that death trap of yours on our first date?!” She exclaimed, exasperated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, it was a nice day! Besides, I got to feel you pressed up against me.” She leaned in, wrapping her arms around Agatha, “Your arms wrapped around my waist, holding me close. Why would I not want that!” She kissed her on the cheek before grabbing her by the hand, pulling her to continue on their walk. “So, noon on Sunday?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll see you then. I actually have to get back.” She turned to leave as Rio tugged her back in, planting a kiss on her lips. Agatha melted into the sensation as she brought her hand up to cup Rio’s face, deepening the kiss. They stood, locked in for a few moments before Rio finally pulled away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You better get going before you’re late! See you Sunday.” She kissed Agatha on the hand and sent her on her way. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sunday rolled around and Agatha was a fit of nerves. She was bloated, her stomach had been doing somersaults all morning, and her heartburn was worse than ever. She was excited to meet Lilia but had an ominous feeling about the woman, given all that Rio had said about her. She wasn’t sure how much she believed about fate and destiny but she couldn’t deny that she had fallen for Rio and now she didn’t want to do anything to mess it up. Her mind kept going in circles, bouncing between doubt, fear, anxiety, frustration. Somehow she could hardly contain the irrational storm brewing inside her. Overwhelmed, she had Ralph help her pick out a nice bottle of wine and her outfit. He even helped her fix her hair, which he rarely did, before he headed out to host a drag brunch at Alice’s bar. Right at twelve on the dot Agatha’s doorbell rang. She grabbed the bottle of wine as she opened the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, well, don’t you look lovely!” Rio purred as she admired Agatha’s outfit, a calf-length brown suede skirt and a plum colored turtleneck t-shirt. “You ready?” Rio asked</span>
</p><p>
<span>“As I’ll ever be.” She groaned</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on, you’ve nothing to worry about! She loves you already!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As they drove over to Lilia's, Rio could feel Agatha’s tension hovering in the seat next to her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mi amor! What’s wrong, you seem a bit tense?” Agatha could feel the anxiety bubbling over drawing tears to her eyes. Before she knew it they were falling down her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just..don’t want her to hate me.” She sobbed as she could no longer hold back her emotions. Rio reached over grabbing Agatha’s hand tightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, no! Don’t cry! Really you have nothing to worry about. Why would she hate you?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Be…because, there’s something wrong with me and… and I know she’s going to see it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What? No, what gave you that idea?” She said soothingly as she rubbed her leg.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You said she saw me coming. What if she was trying to warn you about me?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nonsense! If anything she was whipping me into shape to not blow it with you. You’re gonna love her, though I’ll warn you she’s a little kooky.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Kooky?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eh, whispy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whispy?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just be yourself and I know you two will get along.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Really?” She sniffled</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, of course! She is going to love you, I promise. She’s been talking about having you over non-stop. You have nothing to worry about.” Agatha took a shaky breath, trying to calm herself down. Rio reached out grabbing Agatha’s hand and pulled it in to give it a soft kiss. With this gesture of comfort she could finally feel the tension start to leave her body. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sorry, I don’t know what came over me! I got myself all worked up.” she said, wiping the last of the tears away from her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No need to apologize. I’m flattered that you want to make a good impression! I am, however, a little worried about you. Is anything else going on?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha bit her lip nervously. Though she had told Rio about her harrowing triumph over that oaf of a man, Christian, she hadn’t given her the full context of why he had been there. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ve just been dealing with my mother and other family business more than usual lately. I think it’s just got me on edge. Bringing up old wounds.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is there anything I can do to help?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not unless you want to go to Boston.” She joked</span>
</p><p>
<span>“When?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have to go in a few weeks, at the end of the month, to finalize my grandfather’s estate. I’ve been putting it off, but now…” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, send me the dates.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha blinked back in astonishment.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, I’ll go with you, if you want me to. Besides, I still have a few things stashed in a storage unit that I’ve been meaning to get so I can stop paying for it.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled the idea over in her mind. It would be so much easier to deal with her grandfather’s estate with Rio by her side. It’d be easier to deal with everything with Rio by her side. The woman knew how to comfort and console her and was every bit the foundation she needed to get through this task.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright. I’ll send you the information. I am planning to be there for about a week.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Great! That’ll give me time to take you out in Boston! I’d love for some of my friends there to meet you as well! If you’re up for it!” She grinned at Agatha as they finally pulled into the driveway. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia’s house sat back at the end of a long driveway, tucked into the forestline. It was an oddly shaped wooden house that blended into the scenery. On one side was a round dome shaped structure with portholes for windows. The roof seemed to have moss and other plant life growing on it. This building was connected to another large cube shaped structure by way of a glass hallway. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As they parked the car and got out they heard a voice calling from the other side of the large overgrown yard. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“There she is! My girl! How are you darling?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia, dressed in patchwork yoga pants, a flowy shirt, and a long sweater, flittered across the yard carrying a basket of assorted herbs and vegetables she had been collecting from the nearby garden. This she dropped to her side as she reached both arms out smothering Rio in an embrace. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I see you’re still getting things ready for lunch!” Rio exclaimed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh you know me, I spaced out and lost track of time.” She looked over, catching sight of Agatha out of the corner of her eye before turning her attention back to Rio. “Well, are you just going to stand there or are you going to introduce me to this radiant creature?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled in annoyance as she beckoned Agatha over. Agatha straightened herself and plastered a brave smile on her face as she walked over. “Lilia, this is Agatha, who I’ve been telling you about.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So nice to meet you. Rio said you liked wine so I brought some for you.” She handed Lilia the bottle which Lilia immediately handed over to Rio. She stepped closer to Agatha so that their chests were nearly touching, her eyes never leaving Agatha’s like she was trying to read something in them. Out of nowhere her hands lurched up sandwiching Agatha’s face as she stared deeper into her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh come on!” Rio groaned</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She moved her hands to Agatha’s shoulders as she leaned back and took her in, head to toe, sizing her up. She narrowed her eyes as she leaned back in, looking into Agatha’s eyes, which were swarming with confusion and worry, before a sly grin grew across her face and she pulled her into a tight hug. Agatha looked back at Rio over Lilia’s shoulder with a concerned grimace. Rio only snickered at Agatha's confusion and gave her a thumbs up as reassurance. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>At last Lilia released her from the embrace and grabbed her by the hand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio, be a dear and grab that basket for me.” She called out as she led Agatha to the front door in the glass entryway. As soon as they crossed the threshold a waft of something delicious filled the air. It smelled of roasted garlic and stewed vegetables. She looked around the plant filled atrium, it felt as if she was back at the botanical gardens. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll ask that you remove your shoes. I don’t like tracking external energies through my home. Feel free to grab any pair of slippers that fit.” Lilia said as she wandered off into the dome side of the building. Agatha could see where Rio got her playful nature, this woman couldn’t be more flamboyant. Agatha flashed Rio a nervous look as she slid her boots off and selected a pair of purple crushed velvet house shoes. They managed to be the least flashy of all the options on the shoe tree. Just as she had slipped the second shoe on Lilia popped her head out at the doorway. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well come on in! Don’t be shy! I’ve not cursed anyone in ages!” She turned back into the room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She’s not serious.” Agatha mumbled, a look of dread on her face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m afraid she’s deadly serious.” Rio chuckled. “Come on, I’m starving!” She threw her arm around Agatha’s waist and guided her into the room. The large circular space was filled with oddities and knick-knacks strewn about in an orderly manner so that nothing looked out of place, yet everywhere you looked you’d find something you didn’t expect. Lilia had taken the helm at the wood burning stove stirring a series of pots simmering with whatever delicious concoctions she was brewing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Lunch should be ready in about 15 minutes, make yourself comfortable. I just have to throw together the bruschetta. Can I get you anything to drink?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We could open the wine Agatha brought if you’d like?” Rio offered. Lilia spun around shooting a calculating look at Agatha before turning back to Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No. I think we’ll be fine.” She dismissed as she turned back to her pots. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You sure? You’re not one to turn down wine.” Rio responded, confused. Agatha could feel her palms starting to sweat. Had she already managed to offend this woman with the wine she brought? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ah! You make me sound like such a lush! We’ll save it for another night.” She turned back around to smile and wink at Agatha. “I have some lemonade or some sun tea if you prefer?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Tea sounds great.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio, the tea is on the back porch. Once you’ve poured your girl a glass, come wash these tomatoes.” Rio disappeared back down the glass hallway to fetch the tea. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Anything I can help with?” Agatha queried. Lilia finally left her post at the stove and walked to grab Agatha by the arm and led her to a large wooden Hoosier cabinet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If you wouldn’t mind setting the table, you’ll find all the plates and silverware in here.” She rubbed Agatha’s arm lovingly as she peered into her eyes once more, seemingly digging for something, before she headed back to resume cooking. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As she gathered the plates and utensils Rio walked over to grab a glass. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s put you to work already I see!” She elbowed Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Your aunt keeps staring at me and giving me odd looks.” She whispered to Rio, glancing back to make sure she wasn’t being watched. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t worry about it. She does that sometimes. She’s just trying to get a read on you.” She said encouragingly. “Like I said, Kooky. Don’t take it personally.” She walked back over to help her aunt finish the food while Agatha resumed setting the table. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Before long they were all seated with bowls and plates of food covering the whole table. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So Agatha, do you say a blessing for your food?” Lilia asked </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Um…no…not since I left the church.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, then you won’t mind then if I say a few words.” She offered </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please don’t!” Rio pleaded as Lilia rose to stand at her seat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“OH great Goddess Mother Earth Devine!” Her voice rang out as she raised her hands to the sky. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t believe you’re doing this” Rio mumbled as she threw her face in her hands. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We thank you for this bountiful feast. May your blessings continue to rain down upon us. Great Goddess Moon we thank you for this time of clarity and reflection as we look within ourselves to find truth.” At that she made eye contact with Agatha. “To you both I make this sacrifice in turn for your continued guidance and protection.” She raised a steak knife, clutching the blade in her hand before slicing it above the salad. Agatha yelped as red liquid began to drip onto the salad, a look of horror across her face. At this Rio jumped up grabbing the hand dripping the liquid. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Drop it.” She commanded. Lilia grinned as she released something from her hand onto the salad. “It’s a beet.” Rio grumbled as she returned to her seat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could feel her heart pounding in her chest as she began to laugh at the realization. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“OH! You don’t let me have any fun!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fun? You’re going to traumatize her!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh please! She thought it was funny!” She proclaimed as she wiped her hand of the juice.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s just being nice!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I did think it was funny.” She chimed in. “After I knew it was only a beet.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I knew you had a good sense of humor. So, how has my niece been treating you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Great so far! I have no complaints.” She snuck a smile to Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good! That’s what I like to hear. Rio says you work at the symphony?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, I’m their donor engagement coordinator.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do they give you any free tickets?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lilia!” Rio scolded</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Actually they do! If there’s something you want to see let me know and I’ll make sure to get you good seats.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“SEE! You don’t know what’s possible unless you ask!” She taunted Rio. “I hear they’re doing a concert version of Candide in the spring. I'd like to go to that.” She said matter of factly. Agatha snickered at the request, “You got it! I can make that happen.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tell me about your family, do you have any siblings?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, no siblings. It was just me, my mother, and my grandfather growing up.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha’s mother is very religious.” Rio explained</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah! Well, how unfortunate. I find the religious unbearably rigid.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are not wrong about that!” Agatha agreed </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And your father has passed, yes?” She asked with eyebrows raised.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I..uh…I don’t know, I never met him.” She looked confusedly at Rio who in turn glared at Lilia. “My grandfather passed a few months ago, I think? I’m not exactly sure when.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah that must be it. Must have gotten my wires crossed. It happens from time to time.” She shrugged, returning to her meal. Rio glanced back at Agatha and mouthed the word, </span>
<em>
<span>wispy. </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha nodded in understanding. </span>
</p><p><span>“What are you two up to this week?” she continued in her questioning.</span><span><br/></span> <span>“Well, Rio’s asked me to Karaoke on Thursday. She’s invited some of my friends as well.” Lilia shoved Rio’s shoulder.</span></p><p>
<span>“When were you planning to invite me? You know it’s been too long since I’ve been behind a mic.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know Thursdays are your salsa nights. I know you’d hate to miss out on that!” She offered pointedly</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nonsense! Not if there’s something better on the table.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Would you like to join us, Lilia?” Agatha asked, trying not to laugh</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why yes, that would be lovely. Thank you dear.” she turned to Rio, “SEE! Was that so hard?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, you can come, but you can’t hog the mic.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will be on my best behavior!” She said with her hand on her chest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They continued on eating as Lilia asked Agatha almost every question under the sun. By the time she had finished her interrogation, they were each stuffed to the brim. Lilia and Rio rose to clear the table and as Agatha went to do the same she was quickly shooed to a nearby couch to relax instead. Before long Rio came over to join her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I hope that wasn’t too terrible. I should have prepared you better for the questions. Lilia doesn’t really have a filter.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh no! Don’t worry about it. She seems sweet. I feel a lot better now than I did in the car.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good, I’m glad to hear it. I do want to give you a heads up, she is going to corner you and ask to read your cards. Though it won’t seem like an option, you can totally say no.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s alright. I’m kind of looking forward to that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“OK, just make sure to take it with a grain of salt. She likes to make a show and she doesn’t hold back. Just so you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re telling me the beet lady is a bit dramatic?” She laughed</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fair point.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks for the heads up.” She leaned over drawing Rio’s lips into hers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright my girls! What kind of trouble should we get into? We could go for a walk around the property - I have a few stones I need to throw at Mr. Burns next door, he stole half my mullberries this season!” she exclaimed</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh I’m so stuffed I don’t think I can move.” Agatha sighed, rubbing her stomach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Very well then, I have a few board games, we could summon the spirits, or I could read your cards?” She smiled with a glint in her eye. Rio glanced at Agatha with an </span>
<em>
<span>I told you so</span>
</em>
<span> kind of look. “Have you ever had your cards read, love?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, can’t say that I have.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah! A virgin! Well done dear!” She patted Rio’s leg, who leaned back rolling her eyes. “I’m gonna get the good deck!” She said excitedly as she scurried off toward the entryway.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She didn’t even say yes! Maybe she doesn’t want to do it!” Rio called out to her. Lilia just turned around and blew her tongue at Rio in response before continuing on to look for her cards. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As they waited for Lilia to return Rio reached out to play with a few strands of Agatha’s hair. Agatha melted into the soft touches, leaning back to snuggle into Rio on the couch. She could hear the calm pulsing beat of her heart as her warmth seeped into her side. Rio moved her hand to glide up and down Agatha’s arm. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Careful, if you keep doing that I’m going to fall asleep again.” She looked up at Rio smiling before laying her head back on her chest. Despite the warning, they each lay there as their eyes began to get heavier quickly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alrighty!” Lilia shouted as she re-entered the room. The women bolted up, startled by her sudden reappearance. “Not falling asleep on me are we?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Please, that meal could have tranquilized a horse!” Rio joked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia settled into an elaborate marigold armchair across from Agatha, a round coffee table between them. She unwrapped the scarf from around her tarot cards and placed them on the table. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So I’ll have you shuffle the cards and cut the deck with your left hand.” Agatha did as she was told and settled them back on the table. “We’ll keep it simple, a three card spread, we’ll look at past, present, and future.” She began to shuffle the cards violently until one sprang out onto the table. “Ah! Let’s see what we have here. Three of swords. Oh my dear, your past was filled with turmoil, so much pain, sorrow, and grief.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No kidding.” Agatha huffed unamused</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have suffered great loss and heartbreak. A former lover, a recent relative, and I’m sensing another loss as well.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>At that Agatha could feel her heart skip a beat though she kept a smile on her face. Lilia resumed shuffling cards, before long another popped out. Lilia let out a bursting laugh as she read the next card before slamming it on the table. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The Lovers!” She exclaimed, pointing at Rio. “I don’t know why you doubt me when I’m always right. You two are a match made by the gods!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced over to Rio who shrugged. “She’s been pulling that card for me for months.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And now your future.” She tossed the cards once again before the final one popped out onto the table. “Well, well my dear! The Empress! You will come into your divine femininity. This card is a sign of beauty, abundance, and fertility.” She beamed at Agatha eyebrows raised, her eyes once again intensely boring into her soul. “Seems like lots to look forward to in your future!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright, not as bad as I thought.” Agatha admitted </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Were you expecting doom and gloom?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I was prepared for it!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, nothing is ever as bad as it seems, and nothing as good as it seems either. Expect neutrality and you’ll never be disappointed.” She said as she rose from her chair and headed back into the kitchen to open up the freezer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Curses!” Lilia grumbled “Rio, dear, I forgot the gelato to go with our dessert! Would you be a doll and run down to the market and grab some?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Right now?” She said sleepily from the couch. “Couldn’t we just skip it this time?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Absolutely not! If you go now you’ll be back just in time for the crumble to be done.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You want to come with me?” She turned to ask Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh leave her be! She’ll be fine to stay here with me.” Lilia grinned. Rio shot Agatha a concerned look. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll be fine, you go!” She insisted. Begrudgingly, Rio rose and headed for the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t let her give you a hard time while I’m gone!” She called out as she left. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh she’s so dramatic!” Lilia scoffed as the door closed and she began to fumble around in the kitchen. “You’d think I’d tortured her growing up the way she acts! I scare away </span>
<em>
<span>one</span>
</em>
<span> of her little girlfriends </span>
<em>
<span>one time</span>
</em>
<span> and now she acts all protective any time she brings someone over. Care for honey or lemon in your tea?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Both please. Oh really? What happened?” Agatha asked with a chuckle. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I read her cards and told her the truth. If she didn’t shape up she was in for a world of pain and anguish. Though, I may have implied, heavily, that it would be at my hands. And perhaps she found a raccoon skull in her shoes when she went to leave, but that’s beside the point. I knew that girl was no good for her.” Lilia wandered back over to the round dining table with the tea and invited Agatha to come sit with her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, really? When was that?” Agatha asked, suspiciously looking back to where her boots were laying. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh that was years ago! I’ve since reformed my ways, you have nothing to worry about dear! Besides, I think you’ll be very good for my niece. She has an unfortunate proclivity for letting her heart wander too quickly down the wrong roads and into trouble.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She mentioned she was engaged once.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh good gods! </span>
<em>
<span>That</span>
</em>
<span> was doomed from the start, but she was too blinded by her infatuation that she couldn’t see it for herself. Some lessons we have to learn on our own.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But you don’t have the same concerns with me?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia let out a bursting laugh, “Not in the slightest! You are exactly what she needs. Someone who is secure enough in their own life to help keep her head out of the clouds. And something tells me she’s just what you need as well.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh really, how so?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio has a big heart that’s aching to smother someone deserving enough to hold it. Through all the grief and pain she has experienced it’s been difficult to find someone who understands. And you, my dear, with all that grief you carry, are more deserving than anyone of that kind of love and understanding.” Agatha could feel her chest tighten at the thought. A mix of fear, sadness, and a touch of anger began to rise within her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What exactly has she told you?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not nearly enough though I do try to pry it from her.” Lilia scoffed. The woman clearly didn’t see or seem to care how uncomfortable this was making her. “But I can see the sorrow hovering around you like a cloak you shield yourself with. Tell me of your grandfather.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We were close when I was younger. Though we grew apart when I left home. I’ve not seen him in years.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ah, so is life. Sometimes our path forward tends to leave others behind. Do not blame yourself for it.” Agatha wasn’t sure how to react to that. The swirl of emotions was tangling itself inside her. Lilia reached out, taking Agatha’s hand, studying the lines in her palm as she continued.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Our bodies tell our story, one way or another you know?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, and what is my hand telling you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Your love line is broken in two. This first part here is deep but rather short.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Meaning?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Your first love was true but fated not to last. Given the abruptness of where it stops I suspect it was sudden?” She could feel her heart start to race at the clarity with which Lilia was reading her. Though, despite the accuracy, Lilia hadn’t gleaned anything that she hadn’t told Rio. She couldn’t let herself get carried away in the theatrics Rio had told her to expect. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Death often is.” She said resolutely, removing her hand from Lilia’s grasp. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ah! That’ll do it! Well, that and losing a child. It’s not so easy to recover. But it is possible with the right person. What’s important is to not lose yourself in the past. Remember it, cherish it, but don’t let it hold you back from future happiness. Especially with so much to look forward to!” Lilia finished with a gleam in her eye, pointedly looking Agatha up and down  as she took a sip of her tea. The swirling feelings intensified at the realization of what she had said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How did you? I mean I haven’t even…Rio doesn’t…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio, dear! Perfect timing!” Just as Lilia finished speaking, the timer on the stove went off. Agatha turned to find Rio carrying in a carton of ice cream. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“They were out of the gelato you like but I grabbed your second favorite.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’ll have to do.” She shrugged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio came to sit by Agatha at the table, placing a kiss on top of her head on the way. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hope she didn’t give you too much trouble!” She said as she smiled cautiously. Agatha, still pondering the conversation, took a moment to come back to reality. She forced herself to shake off the eerie feeling she had, that Lilia knew more than she was letting on, and turned her attention back to Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, no, no trouble. We just had a chat… got to know each other a bit more.” She replied with a soft smile reaching out for Rio’s hand to ground her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Glad to hear it!” Rio beamed as she placed a kiss on Agatha's hand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They enjoyed dessert as Lilia babbled about different neighbors and bragged about Rio’s many accomplishments. Before long they realized their visit had come to an end. Lilia gathered their leftovers in containers to send them both home with and gave the large basket to Rio to take out to the car. Agatha cautiously made her way into the hallway to collect her shoes where she pleasantly found them lacking any animal bones. As she began to slip them back on, Lilia joined her on the small bench. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I hope I didn’t offend you earlier, bringing up old wounds. I can get carried away sometimes.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, it’s…it’s fine. I just. How did you know? I hadn’t said anything to Rio about the miscarriage.” She glanced up to see Rio in the driveway loading up the car. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ah, I suspected as much! Not to worry, in your own time then. Just know, she’ll understand everything, when you’re ready.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That didn’t really answer my question.” She chuckled as she stood. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Doll, I’m a witch! I know more than you realize.” She stood to open the door, gathering Agatha’s hand as she led her to the car. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Now, you two don’t get into too much trouble before I see you on Thursday alright?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We’ll try, can’t promise anything.” Rio quipped as she leaned in to hug Lilia goodbye. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And you my dear! Take good care of yourself. Make sure to eat and drink plenty of water, get some good sleep! You’re going to need it!” Agatha chuckled again in confusion as she was enclosed in another one of Lilia’s all consuming hugs. As Lilia released her from the embrace she held firmly onto her arms, staring once again into Agatha’s eyes for a moment before she moved a hand and patted Agatha on the stomach as she stepped away. Agatha huffed a breath of confused amusement as she turned to get into the car, shaking off the interaction as another one of Lilia’s oddities. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>They drove back in a contented silence while music filled the space around them. Agatha reflected on the encounter, spinning endless questions through her mind that she wasn’t sure she wanted the answers to. Rio, seeing her caught in thought, rested a hand on her thigh bringing her back into the moment and creating a sense of grounded comfort. She knew that, despite the confusion and questions the visit had brought, Rio was the foundation and security she needed. She didn’t want to hide any parts of her past from her, no matter how painful or traumatic. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As they approached Agatha’s house Rio spoke, “I hope today didn’t change your mind about Thursday. I know Lilia can be a lot.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, not at all.” She laughed, “She actually helped put a few things into perspective for me.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh really? What’s that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“There’s…um… something we haven’t talked about yet. I think it’s time I’ve shared with you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, ok? What’s up?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“When I lost Wanda…” she cleared her throat, feeling the tension building inside her once again. “We were starting a family.” Rio patiently observed her and gave her space to continue. Eyes full of concern and care. “And then I lost her and everything fell apart.” She could feel the tears already streaming down her face. “I struggled to take care of myself…I lost the baby.” Rio said nothing but reached out and took Agatha’s hand. “I couldn’t bear the thought of living after that. If it hadn’t been for Jen and Ralph… I never would have lived to meet you.” With that a small smile shone through the tears. “I didn’t think I would ever feel this happiness again. I closed myself off to it. But you” She looked up at Rio, her crystal blue eyes glistening with tears. “You changed everything.” The weight of that admission hung in the air, dissolving any tension that remained. She let herself sink into those honey amber eyes and all she could feel was the all-consuming desire to close the distance between them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She surged forward pulling Rio’s lips into her’s, devouring the woman before her. Her hands reached up and coiled themselves in Rio’s hair as she drew her closer and deeper, their tongues entangling each other. She could smell the overwhelming scent of rain, and earth, and incense which stoked the fire that was now burning inside her. Her hands began to wander, grasping wildly as she ached to feel her body pressed against her’s. At the urgency of Agatha’s pawing, Rio broke the kiss, panting breathlessly, and rested her head against Agatha’s. She gazed into her eyes as a smile grew across her face. Agatha glanced back as a similar smirk reflected on her face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Maybe we should take this...AHHH! FUCKER!” She jolted back, startling Rio in the process. Ralph was hovering just outside the driver side window in full drag, smiling and waving his fingers. Rio rolled the window down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey!” She laughed. “I’m Rio.” She reached her hand through the window.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nice to meet you! I’m Lady Bohner.” Ralph said as he shook her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ralph you absolute shit head! What the fuck?!” Agatha shouted, still breathless from the shock. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I saw you pull up and then y’all were just sitting here so I thought I’d come check in and introduce myself. I didn’t know I’d be interrupting something!” He laughed. “Besides, you’re blocking my space.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ll move in a bit, get out of here!” Agatha reached over and rolled the window back up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine, I’ll move my car later.” Ralph scoffed as he turned to head into the house. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sorry about that!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No worries, your friend seems nice.” She chuckled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I guess. I’ll see you Thursday?” Agatha asked as she gathered her things from the car.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, looking forward to Thursday. We’ll have to pick up where we left off.” Rio leaned over, capturing Agatha in another kiss.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“OW OW!!!” Ralph shouted from the porch. Agatha groaned as she hung her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m gonna kill him.” </span>

<span>All week Agatha had replayed their last conversation in her head. She felt as though a huge weight had finally been lifted and a barrier broken down. That kiss in the car, she had craved it to go further. She wanted to feel the outcome of all that had been building between them. Now with her full self seen, all her fear, all her trauma, entrusted with Rio, she was ready to give herself over and move forward.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her dreams became haunted with anticipation once again. Rio’s hands, her body, her tongue lighting every nerve on fire with desire. She had tried to ease the tension herself but found the knot of lust too tight to be unwound by her alone. By the time Thursday rolled around the hunger had become almost unbearable. She rushed home straight after work to change and pick up Ralph. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Remember you’re getting a ride home with Jen!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How could I forget? Rio’s got your booty on call tonight.” He thrusted the air making moaning noises. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Gross.” She stated flatly. “Ok, how do I look?” She spun around to show him her fitted dark wash jeans paired with a black blazer, one low button holding it closed, allowing for her lacy black bra to peek through. Her hair was held back in a low ponytail with a few long pieces framing her face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Perfect, classy but totally fuckable. That bra is doing some </span>
<em>
<span>work</span>
</em>
<span>!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh! Tell me about it. My tits barely fit, I think I need to go up a size or something. It’s almost uncomfortable, but they do look fantastic!” She turned around checking herself out in the mirror. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio’s gonna love it!” Ralph praised. Agatha tongued her cheek, grinning in anticipation for later that evening. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright, let’s head out. I don’t want Jen to beat us there!” She grabbed her keys and overnight bag and shoved Ralph out the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As they pulled up to the building she could already see Jen and Alice chatting with Rio on the steps. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh great! I knew I shouldn’t have changed again. Who knows what Jen’s telling her!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oooo! Something embarrassing I hope. Like that time you got lost at that concert because you were too high on shrooms and ended up on stage!” He doubled over cackling. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We will not be bringing that up!” She snapped at him. “Best behavior or I will kick you all out!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, mother!” He groaned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As they got out of the car they could hear the three women talking and laughing. Agatha plastered a strained smile on her face, already annoyed at whatever they were laughing at. As soon as Rio spotted Agatha she waved and started to make her way over. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“My love! At last!” She bounded down the last few steps, nearly toppling Agatha as she captured her in an embrace. As soon as she released her she cupped her hands around her face and pulled her in for a kiss. “Damn girl! You look good enough to eat!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Better save room for dessert then!” She teased. Rio’s eyes flashed with desire as she tongued her cheek and raised her eyebrows suggestively before leaning in for a deeper kiss. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you two done being gross and gay?” Ralph coughed. Rio laughed, ending their kiss. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nice to meet you in this form Ralph.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nice of you to finally join us! I warned Rio you’re chronically late!” Jen shouted as she joined them at the bottom of the steps. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh is that what you all were joking about when we pulled up?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, actually!” Jen bit back, “We were commiserating about the new head nurse on night shift! Not everything is about you Agatha!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She is a total bitch.” Rio shrugged. Agatha rolled her eyes and gave Jen a pointed look. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Whatever, can we go eat please?” She took Rio’s hand and headed inside. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah I bet you need to eat. Improve that attitude.” Jen scoffed under her breath as she, Alice, and Ralph followed them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No shit! This really is a school! It’s a little weird being here at night… as an adult.” Ralph commented </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know what you mean. It feels like I’m breaking in.” Alice agreed. They listlessly wandered around taking everything in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Over here, hurry!” Rio shouted from the elevator as the doors started to close. The three of them rushed over just as Rio halted the doors with her foot. “Can’t leave you stranded!” She said as the doors creaked back open. Once they filed in she pressed the button for her floor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Here, will you take your bang bag now?” Ralph dangled Agatha’s backpack in front of her which she promptly ripped from his hand, eyes glaring, her face immediately flushed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Really?!” She spat to which Ralph beamed, clearly proud of himself. Her eyes darted to Jen and Alice who were snickering in the corner. “Don’t you dare!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen threw her arms up in defense, “I didn’t say anything!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She glanced over at Rio who had an amused smile across her face as she reached her arm around Agatha, pulling her close to her side. She couldn’t help but smile in response. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is Lilia coming for dinner?” She asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, Lilia is making dinner. She got here at 3 and has been cooking ever since!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are we even going to be awake enough for karaoke after dinner?” Agatha laughed, to which the other three exchanged glances.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I told her to keep it light, but then again I said the same thing about lunch on Sunday and you see how that turned out!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The elevator doors dinged open and they filed down the hallway and into Rio’s apartment. They were immediately hit with the scents of the Italian feast waiting for them. Sounds of pots and pans shuffling stopped as soon as the door closed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio! You brought friends back!” Lilia lilted as she greeted them in the hallway. “And there she is! My glowing, gorgeous girl!” She swallowed Agatha into a hug then kissed her on both cheeks. “How are you feeling dear?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m doing alright. Thank you! Lilia, these are my friends, Ralph, Alice, and Jen.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jen and I actually work at the same hospital. Fortunately we haven’t had to work together much yet. Lots of healthy babies! Everyone, this is my Aunt Lilia. She’s feeding us tonight and will dominate all of you in karaoke later.” She said as she scanned her finger to point at each of them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Looking forward to it, and that food it smells incredible!” Ralph drooled</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio’s helped keep me on track so everything’s ready. Grab a plate, mangia!” They filed in, filling their plates with the smorgasbord before them then settling on the couch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Anybody want wine?” Lilia shouted from the kitchen. There was a mumbled chorus of </span>
<em>
<span>absolutelys </span>
</em>
<span>as everyone dug in. She quickly filled and passed around a series of glasses, as she was showered with muffled compliments on the food. “There’s a charm on the end of everyone’s glass so make sure you're not drinking someone else’s!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m pretty sure my mom has those.” Ralph leaned over to whisper to Alice, snickering. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Make sure you leave room for dessert, there’s tiramisu.” She announced as she left to make herself a plate. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What time is karaoke?” Jen asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I signed us up for the last slot so we have 30 mins before we want to head down there. Also we’ll need a team name.” Rio replied. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Team name?” Agatha asked, puzzled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, for the karaoke competition.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The what?!” They all shouted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did I not mention that part?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You said they have karaoke on Thursdays. You didn’t say anything about a competition.” Agatha said, a little panicked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh well don’t worry, it’s pretty chill. But do know, tonight first place gets a $150 in gift cards to Chili’s”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That could buy each of us a chicken crisper combo.” They all turned to Ralph. “Don’t act like I’m the only one who takes advantage of their happy hour!” He exclaimed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How does it work?” Alice asked </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Its bracket style. You can sign up by yourself or as a team. Each round is a different musical style. If we make it to the finals we’ll need to have a group number ready.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How does that work if you signed up by yourself?” Jen asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You get to team up with whoever agrees to join you from the audience.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What are the genres for each round?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Round 1 is Pop, Rock or Country. Round 2 is Funk, Jazz, or R&amp;B. Round 3 is Musical Theatre or Disney. And the final round is a group number. There’s two songs per round except for the finals which is just one. And they will cut you off if the song goes too long or repeats a lot.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So what’s our team name?” Alice asked </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Lesbians and the Gay Boy” Ralph offered</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Creative.” Agatha scoffed sarcastically </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Does…does that apply to Lilia?” Jen asked. They all turned to look at her.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh dear, I couldn’t be more queer if I tried!” Lilia laughed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She was married to my moms sister.” Rio explained. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Done! It’s perfect!” Ralph said decisively</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We’ll keep it as a placeholder until we can think of something better.” Agatha resigned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So, whose singing when?” Rio asked the group. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I call round 2, I already had a song planned to start with and it fits.” Jen announced. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Janice is one of my go-tos so happy to start us off in round one.” Alice offered </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well I can’t not sing Dolly so I guess I’m also going in round one.” Ralph stated. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well Lilia has to do round 3, trust me.” Rio explained, “So that leaves you and me for 2 and 3, I’ll let you pick.” She offered Agatha</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I have a few I could do for round 2, but I think there’s one I could really sell in round 3.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Great, we’ll save you for round 3 and I’ll pick out a number for round 2.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“This is all assuming we get that far!” Jen huffed </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I have no doubt we’ll make it to the finals. Wait until you hear the competition! As long as you all can carry a tune, this will be a breeze.” Rio admitted </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Then what group number are we doing?” Alice asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That depends, thoughts on the Spice Girls? It’s a throwback but a crowd pleaser.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Only if I’m Baby Spice!” Ralph exclaimed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sure.” Agatha rolled her eyes “We have one too many people. Who’s sitting out?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh honey, I don’t do group numbers.” Lilia declared </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That solves that problem. I guess we’re set then?” Jen asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Lesbians and the Gay Boy!” Ralph shouted </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m still not sold on that but whatever, we better head down.” Agatha stated as she stood up grabbing her glass of wine and finishing it off. “Any chance we could get a refill for the road?” She burped. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sure! Anyone else want to top off before we head down?” Rio asked. There was a series of nods from the group. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll get that doll! Why don’t you get your friends some dessert to take down?” Lilia offered as she took the glasses back into the kitchen, Rio following behind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Perfect, I’m gonna pee before we go.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha, that's like the 4th time you’ve gone since you came home!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What can I say? I stay hydrated and that wine went right through me! Don’t leave without me!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wouldn’t dream of it, my love!” Rio proclaimed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When she got out their wine glasses were lined up with containers of tiramisu sitting on the counter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Make sure you’re grabbing the same glass from dinner!” Lilia reminded them as they grabbed their stuff on the way out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio guided them all down to the theatre as she showed off the different features of the building and answered all their questions. When they arrived Rio checked them in at the table out front of the theatre. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Checking in for group 16.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Vidal? Is that your team name?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I think we’re going with Lesbians and the Gay boy.” She checked with the nodding group as Agatha rolled her eyes, resigning herself to this decision. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ha! Alright, they’re finishing up the pairing before you, here’s your song submission slip for round 1. If you make it to round 2 they’ll give you the next slip.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sweet! Alright folks, this way!” Rio led them into the theatre where about 80 people were watching a girl butcher some Beyoncé song. She guided them to a few rows near the end. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“This is way more involved than I thought it would be. There are so many people here!” Agatha commented as they sat down. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah it’s been pretty popular. I also think Chili’s really brought out the crowd tonight.” Rio joked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright folks that was Jenna with </span>
<em>
<span>Love on Top. </span>
</em>
<span>Give her a round of applause!” The crowd gave a moderately enthusiastic cheer for the girl who had been singing. “Now’s your chance to decide who won this round. Make sure to cheer loudly for your favorite! First we have Jenna!” The room resounded with the same level of enthusiasm as before. “Alright, pretty good. Now how do we feel about Tony?” The crowd burst with cheers and hollering. “Sounds like we have a winner, Tony with team Avengers, you made it to round 2! Feel free to take a seat as we bring up our next and final pairing for round 1. We have The Sanderson Sisters and Lesbians and a Gay Boy, send up your contestants!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Coven of Chaos!” Agatha shouted from the audience. “Not lesbians and a Gay Boy!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright I’ll get that changed, send up your people.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I couldn’t do it.” She shrugged to Rio who shook her head and chuckled as she wrapped an arm around Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice and Ralph ascended the stairs to the stage and immediately turned to rock, paper, scissors to see who would go first. Alice won out so Ralph would start them off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright it looks like we have our contestants up here we’ll start with the sisters first. Tell us your name and what you’ll be singing.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m Sarah and I’ll be singing Birds of a Feather by Billie Eilish.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sarah, really?” The host asked, to which the girl nodded. “Alright, the stage is yours!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The music began to play as Sarah mumbled through her song. They ended up cutting it off after the first minute, seeing the lack of enthusiasm from the crowd. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ok Sarah. Great job, let’s take a listen to…” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ralph” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ralph with team chaos! And what are you going to be singing for us?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jolene”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“A classic, alright let's hear it!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As soon as the music started Ralph was in the zone, clearly channeling his best Dolly, and the crowd was loving it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“He’s really selling it up there, this is going to be a slam dunk!” Rio praised</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We’ll have to see how Alice does, I’ve not heard her sing.” Agatha replied</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh you have no idea what you’re in for, she’s gonna kill it!” Jen retorted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The song came to an end and Ralph was met with thunderous applause and whooping. He bowed with the biggest grin of satisfaction then turned to Alice, “Beat that!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know we’re not competing with each other, right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That remains to be seen, I’ve set a pretty high bar!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That you’re about to be squashed with!” Alice laughed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright, alright! Our teams have one more song to sway your votes, Sanderson’s you’re up!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sarah once again took the stage and this time opted for some Taylor Swift song that the audience seemed to enjoy more, though still not as much as Ralph’s. “Thank you Sarah! Hang tight while we hear the final song of round 1! Coven of Chaos, what have you got for us?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alice. I’m singing Piece of my Heart.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The music started and as soon as Alice opened her mouth jaws were on the floor. It was like Janice Joplin had inhabited her body. The crowd was going absolutely nuts, though they did decide to end about two minutes in at the guitar break. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“OK, while I think we know who won this round, let’s make it official. Sanderson Sisters?” The crowd clapped encouragingly. “And Coven of Chaos?” The room exploded in thunderous applause. “I think we have a clear winner. We’ll see you all in round 2! Feel free to mill about, we’ll get started here on round 2 in about ten minutes once we have our song submissions in. Just make sure you’re back in time if you’re singing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice and Ralph rejoined the group, both beaming with pride. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sorry to give you such a tough act to follow! But what can I say, we nailed it!” Ralph said as he and Alice high fived. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You two were quite impressive!” Rio admitted. “Now it’s time for an actual challenge. Jen you ready?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Let’s do this!” They headed to the stage to submit their song requests.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m going to head to the bathroom while we have a break.” Agatha moved to exit her row.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Again? Really?” Ralph said judgingly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes again! Move!” She pushed past him and headed down the aisle to the restrooms just outside the theatre. As she exited the stall she found Lilia waiting for her at the sinks. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you still doing alright?” She asked as Agatha washed her hands. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, yeah! Never better. Usually I’m three sheets to the wind after two glasses of wine but I’m feeling rather steady. Probably all that delicious food you made for us soaking it up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Probably.” Lilia shrugged in response. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you want to go first or second for our round?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh dear, you’ll want to go first. Trust me, I’m a tough act to follow.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh I don’t doubt that at all! Well, I’ll see you out there.” She headed for the door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“See ya, doll!” Lilia waved and shared a surreptitiously wise smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It sent a shiver down Agatha’s spine as the door closed behind her. She quickly returned to her seat and snuggled into Rio. Her radiating warmth quickly calmed the buzzing awkwardness that the encounter with Lilia had stirred in her. Her arm resumed its position across Agatha’s shoulders, her fingers rubbed soothing circles along her arm. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We’ve got about 30 mins before we’re up, they just started the first set.” Rio told her. They sat there as their bodies slowly melted further into each other's touch. Rio’s hand danced between rubbing Agatha’s shoulders and stroking the length of her hair. As time drew on she could feel the pull of sleep and rested her head against Rio’s shoulder. She felt safe and calm and relaxed. Her eyes grew heavy and she started to drift off just as Rio tapped her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not falling asleep on me again?” She grinned down at Agatha. “I didn’t want to wake you, but I’m up.” She shrugged apologetically. Agatha sat up and readjusted to her surroundings, finding Jen already on stage beckoning Rio up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, go on! Get up there! I’m ready to be wooed!” She winked at Rio and leaned back, crossing her legs and draping both her arms across the seats beside her. Rio playfully bit at Agatha and turned to join Jen on stage. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Looks like we have our coven up here and Some guy named Dave. So Dave, you’re back again. Are you not a part of a team called some guy named Dave, is it just you?” Dave, who was dressed in cargo shorts, socks and slides, and a black zip-up hoodie leaned in to answer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, it’s just me, some guy named Dave.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Incredible. Well welcome back. Why don’t you start us off with your first song.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mmmmkay” He half-belched. “I didn’t realize there were genres. I only know Frank Sinatra and cock rock. So…I’ll be singing My Way.” Dave proceeded to shout sing My Way and finished off with another belch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, that was…something, wasn’t it folks. Let’s move over to our competitors, which member of the coven do we have here?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hi, everybody! I’m Jen, I’ll be singing </span>
<em>
<span>Come away with me</span>
</em>
<span> by Nora Jones” Jen’s voice breezed over the melody. You could feel the audience relax after the jarring tune Dave had gifted them with. Agatha had to admit, Jen had a pleasing voice and would safely take them on to the next round. Her meditative lilt came to an end and the audience sighed and clapped resoundingly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If that wasn’t the most beautiful song of the night so far folks!” The host applauded “Hate to say it, but we are back to Dave. Dave, what have you got for us this time?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The only other Sinatra song I know, </span>
<em>
<span>That’s Life</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Really, I thought you were gonna say </span>
<em>
<span>Fly me to the Moon</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What is that? Never heard it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well you’ll have to look into it later, I think you’d love it. Alright, everybody, Some guy named Dave!” Dave, once again, treated their ears to an aggressive version of That’s Life and was quickly shoo-ed to the side of the stage. Lilia leaned down and whispered to Agatha, “I can only imagine how entertaining his cock rock is.” to which she snorted, unable to hide her laugh.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ok, time for something completely different, I hope. What are we singing?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey, I’m Rio. This one goes out to my lady love! She’s over there about six rows back, the stunning brunette in the black top!” Rio pointed out Agatha as heads turned to find her. She preened, tossing her hair over her shoulder. A heat rose in her chest at the way Rio was flirting with her, bold and unapologetically. “This one’s for you, mi amor!” She blew Agatha a kiss which she “caught” above her head. “Hit it!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, ok, hit it I guess.” mumbled the host. The silky tones of Etta James </span>
<em>
<span>At Last </span>
</em>
<span>began to play through the sound system. Agatha’s heart began to flutter as Rio opened her mouth to sing. The sound that emanated was velvety and smooth and thick and rich like caramel. It oozed out of her with ease floating directly toward Agatha. Every line, every word, was pointed in her direction. Rio’s eyes only melted her further. The tingling warmth bloomed throughout her chest and spread down further into her body. Her heartbeat quickened down to her core. As the final notes rang out the sensations within her were so unbearable she had to bite back her lip to distract herself. Rio handed the mic back to the host, blew Agatha another kiss, and jogged over to stand with Jen. Agatha trance was finally broken and she looked down to find Ralph and Alice staring at her, their mouths agape with excitement.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shut up!” she teased as she turned her attention back to the stage. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, to me we have a clear winner, but let’s see what our audience thinks. How do we feel about Dave?” There was a smattering of unenthusiastic applause. “Right, about what I expected. And for our coven?” Once again they were met with thunderous applause and cheers. “There you go, we’ll see more witches in the next round!” Dave leaned in grabbing the mic again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you folks. I would have done the same! ROCK FLAG AND EAGLE!” He shouted as he exited the stage. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What a fucking guy!” Ralph sighed amusedly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks Dave! Those of you in the semi-finals, make your way to the stage to submit your songs. We’ll get started again in about ten minutes.” Agatha moved to get up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Bathroom again?” Ralph snickered</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Bathroom again</span>
</em>
<span>” Agatha mocked, “No, I’m going to submit my song and kiss my girlfriend!” She clicked her tongue in annoyance and headed down the aisle to the stage. She met Rio at the bottom of the stairs and wrapped her arms around her shoulders as their lips met in a kiss. “Oh my gods, honey! That was incredible!” she exclaimed “and so hot!” She whimpered, biting her lip. Rio surged forward, capturing her lips in another kiss.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Gross, get a room!” Jen scolded as she moved past them</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I have a whole apartment!” Rio shouted back at her. She turned back to Agatha, “If I hadn’t waited weeks to hear you sing I’d say fuck this and take you there right now.” She groaned. “Get up there so we can keep this moving, I don’t know how much longer I can wait.” She moved Agatha around her and gave her a playful smack on the ass. As she turned back around she was startled to find Lilia right in front of her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You be gentle with her! The last thing she needs is to fall down the stairs!” She scolded</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Relax, we’re just flirting.” Rio shrugged. Lilia rolled her eyes and moved past Rio to submit her song. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As soon as everyone was settled they started the round. Instead of snuggling into each other Agatha sat straight up, her hand entwined with Rio’s. She had to admit, she was a little nervous. This wouldn’t be a normal go to song for her but she really enjoyed the character aspect of the part she was singing and knew that she could be convincing. She could feel the bubbles of anticipation rise in her chest as the first set finished up proclaiming the Avengers the winners headed to the finals. She looked cautiously at Rio as she and Lilia were called to the stage. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You got this! Go kick some ass!” Rio said encouragingly and kissed the back of Agatha’s hand. Lilia met her at the end of the row and wrapped an arm around her waist, guiding her up to the stage. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Congratulations! Both teams have made it to the semi-finals, looks like we have Coven of Chaos back again and Twincinnati, looks like three sets of twins who I all assume are from Cincinnati. How did you hear about this?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We’re in town for a wedding.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“In town for a wedding, fantastic! Well go ahead and start us off, what are we gonna hear from you?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m Billy, and I’m going to be singing </span>
<em>
<span>Hakuna Matata</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Excellent, a crowd favorite!” Billy bumbled through Hakuna Matata relying on audience participation for about half the song. Though most people seemed to be enjoying themselves it wasn’t a stellar performance. As the song wrapped up Agatha could feel the pang of nerves come to a peak. This was it, it was her turn.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Great job Billy, really got the crowd going there! Now on to another one of our witches in the Coven of Chaos. If i’m not mistaken, your teammate there sang that last song to you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Indeed she did!” Agatha proclaimed, beaming with pride, throwing a kiss to Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nice! Will you be returning the favor?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I hate to admit that did not cross my mind when I made my song choice. Sorry babe!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“All good!” Rio shouted from the audience. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Musical theatre and Disney aren’t usually in my repertoire but I love being a bit dramatic so I went that route.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Great! What’s your name and what are you singing?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m Agatha and I picked </span>
<em>
<span>Mother knows best </span>
</em>
<span>from Tangled.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright! A little villainous!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I have excellent source material!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, have at it!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha closed her eyes and channeled every bit of Evanora she had collected throughout the years and gave the performance of her lifetime. Drama seeped from her the moment the music started. She bounced easily between all the emotional peaks and valleys leaving the crowd in stitches and ending with a vicious cackle. The audience ate it up, whooping and cheering as the song finished. Loudest of all was Rio who was shouting, “That’s my girlfriend!” over the crowd. Her face gleamed with pride as she took a dramatic bow. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“WOW! I’d watch your hair around her!” The host joked. Agatha tossed her ponytail with a flourish as she rejoined Lilia, who gave her a squeeze of admiration. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright the twins have one more chance to make it into the finals. What’s your name and what are you singing?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m Tommy and I figure go big or go home so I’m singing </span>
<em>
<span>Giants in the Sky</span>
</em>
<span> from Into the Woods.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Woah, Sondheim, that can be tricky! Good luck to you!” The host patted him on the back and the music started. Tommy’s voice was bright and clear as it lilted over the melody. He was cool and confident like he had sung it a million times, only flubbing a few times during some of the chromatic shifts. As the final note rang out the audience roared with approval. This wasn’t going to be easy for Lilia. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wow what a stellar performance! That’ll be a tough act to follow but someone’s gotta do it. Let’s get our next contestant out here. Who are you and what are you singing?” Lilia, completely unbothered and unintimidated by Tommy’s performance, sauntered to the center of the stage and grabbed the mic. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m the ringer. HIT IT!” She pointed to the sound booth. “</span>
<em>
<span>Here she is boys!” </span>
</em>
<span>She threw off the shawl she was wearing revealing a sparking jumpsuit. “</span>
<em>
<span>Here she is world!” </span>
</em>
<span>She tossed off her headdress, shaking out her curls. “</span>
<em>
<span>Here’s Rose!” </span>
</em>
<span>The music burst through the sound system playing Rose’s turn. “</span>
<em>
<span>Curtain up!” </span>
</em>
<span>Lilia sang as the curtain rose behind her. “</span>
<em>
<span>Light the lights!” </span>
</em>
<span>A spotlight turned on and focused on Lilia. Half the audience turned around to figure out what was happening. “</span>
<em>
<span>Play it boys!” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia proceeded to give a Tony worthy performance of the song. She had everyone in attendance at the edge of their seats. The range, the commitment, it was unbeatable, even with Tommy’s Sondheim choice. They were pretty sure they had it in the bag. By the time she finished, people were standing and cheering for her. She bowed gracefully and made her way back to Agatha at the side of the stage. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“WOW! Wasn’t that just incredible folks! I think this one is gonna be tight! Let’s hear it for Twincinnati!” A wave of cheers echoed throughout the room. “And how do we feel about our coven?” Roaring applause filled the room. People were once again on their feet cheering. “Alright, I think we have a winner. The coven will be advancing to the final round. Don’t go anywhere folks, we’ll continue here in about ten minutes with the final showdown. Finalist, come up and submit your songs.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio ran down the aisle, grabbed Agatha around the waist and hoisted her up spinning them both around. “Oh my gods! You were amazing!” Rio praised. She lowered her down and immediately captured her in a kiss. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Was it worth the wait?” Agatha hummed </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You were definitely worth the wait!” Rio replied with hungry eyes. Agatha felt a bolt of heat shoot through her body. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on, one more song and then you’re all mine.” She led Agatha back to the rest of the group who were fawning over Lilia. Ralph was down on his knees bowing over and over. He sat up as he saw Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Where the fuck did she come from? That was insane! How’d you get them to do the tech?” Ralph asked </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’d be surprised what you can get people to do for some homemade tiramisu.” Lilia winked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright we gotta figure out this group number thing. They sing different parts. Who's who?” Jen asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I already called Baby!” Ralph shouted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We know!” Jen and Agatha replied in sync. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Clearly I’m Scary Spice. That leaves Ginger, Sporty, and Posh.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re looking very posh tonight, my love!” Rio purred as she squeezed Agatha closer to her side. “I’m fine with either of the other two.” Rio offered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I hate to say I’m not super familiar with the spice girls so you tell me.” Alice admitted. Ralph looked her over. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ginger for sure. I mean look at your hair. That’s close enough.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I guess that makes me sporty!” Rio broke away from Agatha’s side and pantomimed shooting a basket. “We’re gonna fucking nail it!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ok, Coven of Chaos and Avengers, can you make your way to the stage, we’re gonna get started.” The gang clambered up to join the four men of team Avengers on stage. “Welcome back folks, you both made it to the final round. You get one song to win it all so make it a good one. Gentlemen, why don’t you start us off?” The four men assembled themselves around one mic and Tony cleared his throat, ‘We’re the Avengers and we’re going to sing, </span>
<em>
<span>Bohemian Rhapsody</span>
</em>
<span>.” A large group of college age men cheered. They were, each of them, rather talented. Able to sing the tune with the appropriate harmonies and were quite the showmen. One brave tenor even belted out the high B-flat. The crowd roared with applause as the final notes faded away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wow! Always a hit and what talent! Alright, our Coven has assembled and they look ready, let’s hear their final song!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They all gathered into a huddle, “Let’s kick some ass!” Rio encouraged them. They threw their hands in the middle and all shouted KICK SOME ASS together then broke apart to take their places on the stage. Jen started with the signature </span>
<em>
<span>Wannabe </span>
</em>
<span>laugh and they launched into the song. Their energy was infectious and quickly got the audience on their feet singing and dancing along. Each of them shined in their role and they all managed to finish the song in a different ending pose. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright! Give them another round of applause! Let’s get our Avengers back out here.” The four men stumbled back to the center of the stage. “Now you all get to decide our champions. Is it the Avengers?” The crowd erupted in cheers. The large group of men near the front were particularly boisterous. “Or is it our Coven of Chaos?” The crowd erupted once again but without the extra boost from the men it was going to be a close call. “It looks like a tight race, they are neck and neck. Let’s hear it one more time for the Avengers!” The group of men went berserk, one even pulled out a tiny air horn. “And our coven?” Lots of cheers filled the room and Lilia whistled loudly with her fingers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And the winner is…the Avengers!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They all groaned in disappointment. “Are you fucking kidding me?” Ralph shouted </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We were clearly robbed! This is some bullshit!” Jen complained. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“All of you were amazing! I’ll take you out for chicken crispers anyway!” Rio offered to which Ralph cheered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You all were magnificent, I don’t know what they were thinking!” Lilia applauded them as she ushered them out of the theatre. They all sauntered through the hallways and back up to Rio’s apartment, joking and laughing about the different participants from that evening. They stumbled into the entryway and each of them found a different surface to support them. Alice sat on the counter and offered Jen the stool to give her a neck rub. Lilia wandered into the kitchen and began to clean the remnants from dinner. Rio swung her arms around Agatha and flopped them both on the couch. And Ralph fumbled over in front of the coffee table and collapsed on the floor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh! How am I still so full? We ate hours ago!” Ralph complained</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Lilia’s food will do that to you. You eat so much of it because it’s so good but then it expands and sits in your stomach like a brick. You probably won’t even be hungry until dinner tomorrow.” Rio explained </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And then you’ll have leftovers to dig into!” Lilia shouted from the kitchen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh my gods! You don’t have to do that!” Alice said as she jumped off the counter and moved to help Lilia put away the food. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No please take some with you, otherwise it’s gonna go bad!” Rio begged</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stirred from underneath Rio who was sandwiching her to the couch, her head resting on Agatha’s chest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, don't leave! I was just getting comfy!” Rio groaned </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry hon, I have to go to the bathroom, I’ll be right back.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Again?” Jen and Ralph asked in tandem. Ralph sat up on his elbows to look incredulously at Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck off both of you! Yes again.” She leaned over and gave Rio a soft kiss, her hand caressed her cheek, as she shuffled off to the hall bathroom. Jen and Ralph shared a judgemental look between them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio moved to join Alice and Lilia in the kitchen. She grabbed the wine glasses and plates  and threw them in the dishwasher. As she turned to grab the bottles of wine to recycle, she noticed something odd about one of the bottles. She had to do a double take before she set them in the bin. It read </span>
<b>Premium Non-Alcoholic Merlot</b>
<span>. She shook her head in confusion and put it aside, resigning herself to ask Lilia about it later. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When Agatha returned from the bathroom she made a b-line for Rio who was at the sink. She came up behind her, placed her hands on the counter on either side of Rio’s body and leaned in, pressing her lips to the shell of her ear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I think I’m ready for these people to leave.” She hummed “How about you?” She pressed herself further into Rio’s back and glided a hand across her stomach dipping a few fingers down the waistband of her pants. Rio caught her breath as she bit her lip and leaned back to take in Agatha’s expression. Her eyes were wide with desire, her cheeks flushed with the heat growing between them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh gods! Look at the time!” She shouted as she turned to face the group. “That was a blast but man I am ready for bed!” She turned and winked at Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If you need us to leave so you two can bang just say that.” Jen said pointedly, half laughing, as she raised an eyebrow. Agatha’s face burned with anger and embarrassment as she stared daggers into Jen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, that is exactly what I’m saying. You get it!” Rio smiled and pointed at Jen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You don’t have to tell me twice, I don’t want to be here for any of that! Come on Ralph!” Ralph groaned as he peeled himself away from the floor and followed Jen and Alice to the door. They all gathered their things, said some quick goodbyes and headed out the door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stood facing the door for a moment, taking in the silence, realizing they were finally alone and feeling the electric hum of anticipation. She took a sharp inhale as she felt Agatha’s presence looming closer, the scent of lilac and honeysuckle growing stronger. As soon as she turned around Agatha’s hands dove to cradle her face, vacuuming their lips together. Agatha’s tongue surged forward entwining Rio’s and pulling it into her mouth. Her body leaned forward chasing the relief she so desperately needed and pushing Rio into the door. Rio’s hands wandered down, finding purchase on Agatha’s hips, and pulled her closer as she slid a leg between her thighs. Agatha let out a moan at the sensation and began trailing hungry, desperate kisses across Rio’s jaw and down her neck. Rio relaxed her head back against the door, eyes closed, taking in every touch. She tilted her head down, intending to nip at the nape of Agatha’s neck, but as she opened her eyes she saw Lilia in the kitchen cleaning the counter. She gasped and tapped at Agatha, pushing her back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey Lilia! I thought you had left with the others!” Rio panted, lips swollen. Agatha coughed out a nervous laugh at the realization and straightened herself up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, no I was using your bathroom. Don’t let me stop you, I’ll be out of here in a moment!” Rio let out a breathy laugh at the absurdity of the situation and walked to join Lilia in the kitchen. “That’s alright Lilia, I’ll take care of it in the morning.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m just gonna go get ready for bed!” Agatha announced, tossing a suggestive look to Rio before sauntering down the hallway to the bedroom.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Really Lilia, it’s alright. I got it. You go, have a good night, let me know when you get home.” Lilia glanced down the hallway after Agatha and once she was sure she was out of earshot she turned back to Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m sure you two have an exciting evening planned, and I won’t keep you from it. Just… be gentle with her. There are some things you and I need to sit down and discuss but… now is not the time.” She patted Rio on the cheek reassuringly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Should I be concerned?” Rio asked confused</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not entirely, no. Just some things to…consider. I’m very happy for you! For both of you! We’ll talk next Saturday when I come over. For now, don’t fret! Have a wonderful time!” She wrapped Rio in a hug, gathered her things and headed out the door. Rio stood there in the kitchen for a moment, pondering Lilia’s evasiveness. A sharp prick of alarm bubbled under her skin. She shook her head, determined to brush it off as she moved down the hallway to join Agatha in the bedroom. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As she swung the door open she took in the sight before her. All the lights were off except for the few candles Agatha had lit around the room. Agatha was perched on the end of her bed, legs crossed, as she leaned back, supported by her arms. Her long wild hair was cascading down her shoulders, finally released from the ponytail she had been wearing, and she had stripped down to her lacy black bra and matching thong. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s jaw hung slack as drool pooled in her mouth at the sight, all concern gone from the conversation she had with Lilia. She was frozen in place at the vision before her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, don’t be shy! I don’t bite…much” Agatha purred seductively. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She bit her lip and took a hard swallow as she padded into the room and closed the door behind her. As if in a trance, she peeled her shirt off and threw it to the side before unbuttoning her pants and stumbling to wriggle out of them. She fell to her knees before Agatha, eyes wide with hunger and her hands hovered toward Agatha’s legs, begging for permission to touch. Agatha leaned forward and hooked Rio’s jaw with two of her long fingers drawing her in the final distance, sucking her up once again into a passionate kiss. Rio’s fingers pressed into Agatha’s thighs as she tried to steady herself. Agatha moved to grip the back of Rio’s head pulling her up and over to where she straddled her lap. She could feel Rio’s heat permeating from her core. She trailed her fingers down Rio’s body to cling to her hips and draw her down further into her lap. Rio moaned, leaning into the sensation as her body hitched forward throwing them both onto the mattress. She caught herself with her arms and took in the vision of the woman splayed out beneath her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s cheeks were flush, her chest heaved as she tried to catch her breath. She smiled up at Rio who was staring down at her in awe. She gazed into the once honey brown eyes that were now black and wild with desire and reached up a hand to caress her cheek. She glanced down to view the sheer green bra and boyshorts and decided they were both wearing far too much clothing. She reached with her other hand in search of a clasp and found none. Rio chucked and leaned back to pull the bra off over her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I guess I could have made that easier for you.” She laughed. Agatha smirked in response as she pulled one of her legs through and hooked it around Rio’s thigh. Rio leaned down and snaked kisses along Agatha’s neck and chest as she thrust her hips forward creating pressure at Agatha’s core. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A moan broke free as she arched into the sensation. Her arms clambered up Rio’s body and wrapped themselves around Rio’s shoulders. She pressed her foot into the mattress and suddenly Rio was on her back, a look of surprised excitement on her face. Agatha straddled her thigh with both hands pressed to Rio’s chest pinning her there. She gave a cheeky smile as her hands wandered up, wrapped themselves at the base of Rio’s neck and she leaned down taking Rio’s mouth into hers once again with an insatiable hunger. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s hands found Agatha’s thighs and she began to rake her nails up and along her body. She stopped once she reached the band of Agatha’s bra and quickly unclasped it. She could feel the weight of her breasts fall onto her chest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sat up briefly, threw the bra off into the room, then grabbed both of Rio’s wrists and pinned them above her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I have to say, this is not what I was expecting, but if you want to be in control, you can be.” Rio huffed breathlessly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh honey!” Agatha purred as she leaned down, brushing her lips against Rio’s ear. “Believe me, I’m in charge.” At that bolt of arousal shot through Rio’s chest straight down to her core where she could feel her clit pulsing with anticipation. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nipped at Rio’s earlobe then worked her way down her neck and chest alternating soft kisses with teasing bites. Once she reached Rio’s sternum she splayed out her tongue licking a trail up to the notch in her collarbone. She could see Rio’s nipples peak and harden in response. She leaned back down, taking one of them into her mouth and sucking desperately. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio whimpered in reply as her eyes rolled back at the sensation. She could feel the wetness between her legs flooding her panties, aching for relief. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha released her hands from where they were pinning Rio’s and brought them down to splay across her ribcage. She released the nipple she had been toying with, a string of saliva dripping from her lips, and moved to turn her attention to the other breast. Her hands wandered down and began to play with the waistband of Rio’s underwear, teasing at the bend where her hips began. All of a sudden she felt fingers entwining in her hair and snapped her head up catching Rio’s hungry, desperate eyes, wide with a look of surprise. She gave a devilish grin as she once again sat up and pinned her hands, this time on either side of her body. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Patience, hon.” She hissed “right now you’re mine.” She placed soft kisses along her stomach, wandering down until she reached the top of Rio’s underwear. She brushed her lips down along the crest of her pubic bone, breathing out a slow hot breath which mingled with Rio’s heat. She could feel the woman shiver with pleasure beneath her. She released Rio’s wrists and brought her hands down to hook into her waistband at the hips. She caught the middle of the band between her teeth and together with her fingers pulled them down Rio’s legs and off her body. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shuddered as the cool air around them brushed against her aching heat. Her hands grasped wildly in the sheets below her as she tried to ground herself and resist reaching out for Agatha. Her eyes darted down and found Agatha crawling back up the end of the bed as she sunk herself back between Rio’s legs. Her crystal blue eyes were dark and stormy with hunger. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha tucked her arms beneath and around Rio’s hips and guided both legs over her shoulders. Her hands wrapped further around her legs at the crest of her hip as she brought herself closer, hovering over Rio’s entrance. She could feel the heat bounce off the flush of her cheeks. She breathed in savoring the musky sweetness that was Rio’s arousal. She let out a slow bated breath as she danced her lips, ever so lightly against Rio’s folds. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio gasped at the sensation, whimpering with delight. She could already feel herself near the edge, the coil inside her pulled taught. She didn’t know how much more of this teasing she could take. Then she felt Agatha’s hands leave her thighs and reach up to interlace themselves with her fingers which were desperately searching for anchorage. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced up, catching the desperate pleading look in Rio’s eyes. She grinned once more, satisfied with that success, and surged forward pressing her tongue along the length of Rio’s lips then latching onto her clit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The moan that escaped Rio’s mouth resounded from the very depths of her core. An unrelenting pleasure pulsated throughout her body, building further and returning to her cunt. She could feel herself arching off the bed, hands gripping Agatha’s for dear life as her legs began to shake and her toes curled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sensing a dam about to burst, Agatha thrust her tongue down through Rio’s entrance repeatedly. She could feel Rio’s walls beginning to clench, as she whimpered and gasped for air. She pried one of her hands away from Rio’s grasp and slid her middle and ring fingers in and up to massage her sensitive spot while she resumed sucking on her clit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s body was aflame, she reached down with her free hand and clutched Agatha’s hair; to which Agatha moaned into her. The white hot pressure at her core was bubbling to a boiling point she didn’t think was possible. She climbed higher and higher, her body shaking uncontrollably until </span>
<em>
<span>snap!</span>
</em>
<span> Waves of euphoria crashed over her. Her whole body clenched in pleasure, legs sandwiching Agatha’s head between them as she arched off the bed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“AGATHA! FFFUCKK!” she cried out before falling back onto the bed limp as a noodle. Her whole body vibrated as she laid there trying to catch her breath, sweat dripping from every pore. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sat back on her heels and wiped Rio’s slick from her face with a self satisfied grin, beaming. She leaned forward and crawled up Rio’s body and collapsed into the crook of her arm. She snuggled close as she let her fingers dance along Rio’s chest playfully. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio slowly gathered herself before turning down to look at Agatha. Her blue eyes sparked back at her with delight, her teeth catching her lower lip. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re telling me you haven’t done that in seven years?” She panted, astonished. Agatha shrugged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s built up a lot of tension.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Clearly!” Rio gasped </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Care to relieve some more?” She raised her eyebrows suggestively. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, “I thought you’d never ask!” She turned into Agatha, draping a leg around her and pulling her close and into a kiss. One hand cupped her face as the other wandered down and latched onto her ass cheek. After a moment Agatha leaned back, breaking their connection. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You mentioned…at one point…a toy box?” Agatha looked into Rio’s eyes curiously, eyebrows raised, “Were you being a tease, or is there something we could play with?” Rio leaned back, shocked but intrigued. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you serious?” She smirked, her mind whirring at the possibilities. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t want you holding out on me! I’ve waited long enough for this!” Rio took in the woman beside her, radiant in the glow of their pleasure. How could she be so lucky? She reached out, tucking a loose strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Anything you want, my love! Anything specific, or?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Surprise me.” She hummed, planting another kiss on Rio’s lips. Rio smirked as she broke the kiss and moved out of the bed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you sure?” Rio confirmed. Agatha nodded vigorously as she rolled herself onto her stomach, crossing her arms and resting her head against them as she kicked her feet up behind her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright, wait right here, I’ll be right back.” Rio disappeared into the bathroom, closing the door behind her. Agatha moved off the bed to strip herself of her underwear, already soaked with her own pleasure, then resumed her position on the bed. She waited a moment, then another, feeling heavier as the time passed, her eyes fluttered closed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio soon returned from the bathroom and found Agatha splayed before her, ass bare. Heat pooled in her already throbbing core. She crept forward and attached her hands to the back of Agatha’s thighs. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha gasped at the sudden touch that jolted her back into the moment. Rio’s hands were massaging their way up to her ass and she could feel the aching pang of desire pool itself again in her core. She lifted herself onto her elbows and looked back at Rio’s hungry eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s hands moved purposefully up Agatha’s body as if worshiping every curve. She leaned down against her back, her arms wrapping around to clutch Agatha’s swollen breasts as her hips rolled in guiding the strap she had adorned herself with against Agatha’s folds, teasing at her entrance. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha moaned at the touch and pressed herself back against the toy as it teased her. A rush of pleasure washed over her and settled in her loins as her clit pulsed with her heartbeat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio please!” She begged as Rio sucked along the crook of her neck. As soon as the words left her lips Rio leaned back and aligned herself with Agatha’s entrance and slowly thrust her hips forward, easing the length in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha cried out in pleasure as she could feel Rio bury herself inside her. Agatha pushed herself back against Rio’s hips, forcing her as deep as possible. She began to slowly rock back and forth along the length, feeling Rio’s body collide with every backswing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio perched her hands on Agatha’s hips, guiding her back to match every thrust. She let one hand loose to reach out, gathering a handful of Agatha’s hair, and pulled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a sharp breath as she cried out, “Yes </span>
<em>
<span>please</span>
</em>
<span>, more! Harder!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio tightened her grip on Agatha’s hair and hitched up a leg so she was straddling Agatha’s ass. She pressed her other hand to the small of her back and looked down at her ivory white skin, now dotted with splotches of red where their bodies made contact. She sunk her nails into the pillowy flesh as she quickened her pace. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha moaned in rhythm with their movements. She could feel the heat and tension being pulled tight within her. Having Rio inside her was scratching the itch that she just hadn’t been able to reach on her own. She hadn’t realized how badly she needed this until now. To just let go and be consumed by each stroke which drove her further to the edge. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ah! I’m so close! Just a little more!” She whimpered between pulses. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smirked through the rush of adrenaline at those words. She let her impulses take control and raised the hand not holding Agatha’s hair and brought it down hard with a </span>
<em>
<span>smack </span>
</em>
<span>on her ass leaving a bright red hand shaped welt. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha screamed in pleasure and buried her head in the sheets below her. She could feel her body begin to shake as the tension intensified, growing white hot and concentrated. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio paused her movements for a moment as she leaned down kissing a trail up her spine to the nape of her neck. She scooped her arms under Agatha’s shoulders and pulled her up and back so that she was leaning against her chest. She wrapped one hand around her neck and squeezed slightly. The other hand trailed down to begin circling her clit as she resumed her thrusting.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned in delight as every inch of her body buzzed with satisfaction. She reached down with one hand and gripped onto Rio’s thigh, strong and grounding. With the other hand she reached back and gripped the back of Rio’s hair, pulling her down to her neck. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio began kissing and nipping down from just below her ear, seeing excitement continue to build with every touch. She looked down at Agatha’s breasts heaving with every thrust and she quickened her pace once again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha began to arch as each sensation was rising to a peak. Higher and higher, the movements of her body became uncontrollable as she dug further into Rio’s leg. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s it my love, you’re almost there, just let go.” Rio whispered into Agatha’s ear. She leaned her head down to rest her lips on Agatha’s shoulder and, overcome by her impulses once more, bit down on the tender flesh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>That was all it took. Instantly Agatha’s body stiffened and arched further back into Rio, almost knocking her off the platform bed frame. Her whole body shook with a white hot euphoria as she clenched around the toy inside her.  She gave a breathy cry, “</span>
<em>
<span>Yes! Yes! Rio! Yes!</span>
</em>
<span>” As she fell forward, the intensity finally dissipating as her body twitched with the echoes of pleasure. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stumbled back and unhooked the harness letting it drop to the floor then crawled up to cradle Agatha’s limp body. They both lay there, huffing in tandem, Agatha on her side staring up at the ceiling, Rio buried in her tangled locs.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That was…” Agatha breathed, still stunned by the encounter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Satisfactory, my love?” Rio offered as she placed a delicate kiss to the spot she had just sunk her teeth into. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Everything.” She confessed turning to look into Rio’s eyes. They had returned to their ever burning honey amber and were glowing in the candle light. “I don’t remember the last time I felt like that. I don’t know if I’ve </span>
<em>
<span>ever</span>
</em>
<span> felt like that.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You weren’t half bad yourself, cariño! With that devilish tongue of yours.” She leaned over pressing her lips into Agatha’s, softly with care, savoring the afterglow. She could still taste the remnants of herself from earlier. She pulled back to peer into Agatha’s twinkling blue eyes. How lucky she was that the fates had gifted her such a creature, who could match her in every possible sense. She gathered a tendril of Agatha’s hair and followed it, patiently, all the way to its end where she picked it up and brushed it against her lips. She took a deep breath in and sat up then reached for Agatha’s hand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Come, my love. Let’s get cleaned up and head to bed.’ She pulled Agatha up as she groaned with exhaustion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha moved to stand and found her legs unreliable. She stumbled forward and grabbed onto Rio’s shoulders. Rio steadied her and led her into the shower. As the adrenaline released in the steamy water, Agatha could feel the weight of sleep descend upon her. Rio’s soft caring touches, as she washed her hair and body, took away any residual tension she may have had. They wrapped themselves in soft, plush towels that were warm from the radiator, brushed their teeth then slid under the covers. They entwined themselves with Agatha resting her head against Rio’s chest, arms curled in close. Rio snaked her legs around Agatha’s and swaddled her. Agatha snuggled in closer and let out a satisfied sigh, letting her eyes drift closed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio?” she murmured in a stupor.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, my love?” Rio hummed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I love you.” She breathed then quickly drifted off to sleep. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I love you too, cariño” Rio rested her head atop Agatha’s and followed her into slumber. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The following week the two could hardly be separated. Though they were both consumed with work responsibilities, every spare moment they had they made time for each other. Rio would swing by for lunch or breakfast, depending on if she was headed to or from work. Agatha would stop by after work, while Rio was on break, and they would take a walk or grab a bite to eat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They discussed plans for their upcoming trip to Boston. Agatha planned to fly out Friday after work to get her grandfather’s estate into a position to host them. Rio would drive down on Sunday after work in Lilia’s van to collect the rest of her things. Lilia stopped by early Saturday morning, before Rio’s last shift, to drop off her car and grab Rio’s keys. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good morning, darling! How’s everything? How’s that girlfriend of yours?” Lilia dragged Rio into a lingering hug. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Great! We’re both pretty fantastic!” She couldn’t help but smile as she thought of Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That is what I like to hear!” She patted Rio on the cheek lovingly. “So, what time are you leaving tomorrow?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I should be on the road by 9. I’ll get in around 2:00, Agatha should have our space ready by then.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Has she left?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah she got in late last night, no issues. She says the place is in worse shape than she thought but should still be fine to stay in.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia frowned in concern, “Well, if you smell any mustyness or mold I want you both out. Go rent a room in a hotel!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, “You got it!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m serious, that stuff is toxic, not good for any of you!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ok, fine! I swear, if anything seems off we’ll get a hotel room.” she said exasperatedly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thank you, I love you both and want you to be safe!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I get it! Hey, I have a question for you!” Rio rushed to change the subject and turned to pull out the empty bottle of wine. “Did you mean to buy this?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia glanced at the all too familiar label, “Yes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio raised her eyebrows in confusion, “Are you cutting back on the booze or something?” she laughed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia stood there stoically, “It wasn’t for me.” she said in all sincerity. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Who was it for?” she asked perplexed, “One of Agatha’s friends?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No.” Lilia stated simply, “It was for Agatha.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio frowned in further confusion. “Did she ask you for this?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No” Lilia repeated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did she know she was drinking this?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not exactly, I asked if she was ok with a Merlot and she said yes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Lilia!” Rio scolded “Why would you do that?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“For her safety.” Lilia said matter of factly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What the fuck are you talking about?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, actually, this is what I wanted to talk to you about.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, fuck.” Rio threw her head in her hands. “Please don’t ruin this for me!” She begged, “I have never been happier, I feel like I’ve finally found someone who makes me whole. I can’t let you take that away from me!” Tears began to well in her eyes as fear gripped her chest in what Lilia was about to say. Lilia, seeing the panic, grabbed Rio by the wrist and led her to the couch. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sit!” she instructed. Rio flopped down on the couch and wiped away the tears that had started to fall. “I need you to listen to me.” She made sure to look into Rio’s eyes. “Do you love her?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat, perplexed by the question and stuttered, “Y-Yes”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you care for her?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Of course.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What I’m about to tell you doesn’t have to change anything about that. In fact, I think it will bring you both closer, if you can keep an open mind, and let it.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Lilia, do not mess with me.” Rio began to grow angry.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Remember I am always looking out for your best interest and wouldn’t bring it up if it wasn’t important.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Just tell me!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Your girlfriend…” she took a breath</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha… is pregnant.”</span>

<p>
<span>“What?!” Rio finally asked after staring at Lilia for minutes trying to digest what she was saying. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I think Agatha is pregnant.” Lilia repeated. Rio let out a nervous laugh, still struggling to comprehend what she was hearing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No… what…what do you mean by that?” She shook her head as the information began to settle. A dull ringing slowly crescendoed as her body began to tingle numbly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia rolled her eyes and picked up Rio’s hands, rubbing them between her’s, coaxing her back to reality. “Sweetheart, your girlfriend is having a baby.” She stared patiently into Rio’s eyes as she saw the news finally settle and her gears start to turn. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes darted around unfocused as they searched through the memories of the last few months. Every thought denied the words Lilia had spoken. She began to shake her head and laugh at the absurdity of the idea. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No…no…what?! No, no, no! Ha, Ha! What is this?! Why are you doing this? I thought you liked Agatha?!” She pulled on Lilia as if pleading with her to admit to her cruel joke. “Don’t tell me you’re jealous of the time we’re spending together?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia furrowed her brow in irritation and offense. “This is not about </span>
<em>
<span>me</span>
</em>
<span>! I’m trying to get you to realize what’s happening so you can make a decision before things go too much further and one or both of you end up hurt!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio let out a huff of air, finally accepting that Lilia was serious in her efforts despite their impossibility. “Ok, Lilia, unless that's an immaculate conception, there’s absolutely no way that’s possible.” She laughed it off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia stared back unamused, “I’m not saying I know any of the details but I am certain.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Certain?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“About 99% sure” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So not the full hundred, but you’re willing to burden me with this revelation! Great! What, exactly, brought you to this conclusion?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, I saw it when you brought her over for lunch. First off, I can read that woman like a picture book. And two, look at her! She glows brighter than a supermoon! She has that radiance about her.” Rio groaned “Then there was her future card! The Empress, though not a direct indication, it reaffirmed my suspicions. I saw it again when I read her palm, and almost got the confirmation but you were a little quicker with the gelato than I anticipated.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Lilia! You sound like that time you ate my weed brownies by mistake! You’re not making any sense. What are you looking to get out of this, huh? Already trying to break us up?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m not </span>
<em>
<span>looking</span>
</em>
<span> for anything! You know I just have a sense about these things! And I wasn’t going to ask! Not directly! For one, you’d kill me.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Damn right!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And it’s a sensitive topic, you know, given the miscarriage. So I had an idea.” she said nonchalantly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shot Lilia a glare, “Wait, how do </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> know about that?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It may have come up?” She shrugged guiltily. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Lilia!” Rio whined, throwing her head in her hands once again. “So, you expect me to believe, based on your hunch, that my girlfriend who hasn’t had a relationship with anyone else, let alone a man, in the last seven years since her wife died, is somehow pregnant?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I can only tell you what I know! Like I said, I don’t have details…”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Or real evidence! Lilia, what do you expect me to do? Drive all the way to Boston and when she answers the door say, </span>
<em>
<span>Hey sweetheart, so happy to see you, by the way, any chance you’re pregnant and just forgot to tell me</span>
</em>
<span>? </span>
<em>
<span>Lilia’s about 99% sure</span>
</em>
<span>!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I mean I wouldn’t be that glib about it. It might come off the wrong way. And you’re wrong about that.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wrong about what?” Rio snapped, as her anger simmered just below the surface. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I have evidence.” Lilia admitted as she dug around in her purse.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You do?” Rio’s interest was piqued with a layer of panic growing over the pit of anger in her stomach. With a flourish, Lilia pulled out a ziplock baggie containing three pieces of long white paper. “What the fuck is that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia shrugged, “A bag of pregnancy tests.” Rio’s eyes scanned the item with a look of horror and confusion growing on her face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Lilia, what the FUCK did you do?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I tested your girlfriend…obviously!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Lilia that’s fucking </span>
<em>
<span>insane</span>
</em>
<span>! HOW did you?! WHEN did you?!” Rio stammered</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“At the karaoke night. I rigged them in the toilet seat. They all came out positive.” Rio could hear her heartbeat drumming through her ears, her face grew hot with panic and anger. She stood and started pacing behind the couch, attempting to quell her anxiety. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“UGH! I can’t believe you did that ! So…it could be anybody’s right? Maybe her friend Jen, or Alice!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I made sure she was the only one who used that bathroom. I had everyone else use yours.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio froze for a moment then let out a bold laugh in astonishment as she stormed back into the kitchen and began furiously cleaning the dishes in her sink, muttering in Spanish. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If that were real don’t you think she would have said something by now? Or, I don’t know, I would have noticed the other night! We’ve been dating for a couple months, how long could she possibly intend to hide something like that?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Dear, again I don’t have answers. I don’t know why or how, I just know before long it’s going to become something the two of you have to deal with and I want you to be ready. If you do indeed love this woman, the way that I see you do, she’s going to need you just as much as that life growing inside her.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Lilia enough!” Rio shouted, “I’m done with whatever game you're playing and I don’t think this is funny!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh sweetheart, I wish it was a game! But life is never a straight path, and the fates are ever fickle!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio paused her messing with the dishes in the sink, throwing down the utensils she was holding with a large crash, and let herself believe for a moment that what Lilia was saying and showing her was the truth. How was this possible? Why didn’t Agatha tell her? Was there someone else? Had there been someone else? The idea of bringing any of this up with Agatha felt like stepping on an open wound. Anxiety pricked at the tendrils of her nerves and a cold panic washed over her. She had finally found someone she could see a future with and she couldn’t bear the thought of losing it. The fates indeed had blessed her with Agatha, but oh what cruel tricks they could play. She could feel her breath growing shallow, coming in short bursts, as the panic began to overwhelm her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia, seeing the inevitable crash out, rushed to her side and forced her into a hug. “Just breathe dear!” She drew calming circles across her back until she could feel Rio’s breath begin to slow, coming now in deep bursts as silent tears started to flow. “Oh sweetheart! It’s going to be alright!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I can’t lose her!” Rio whimpered as she wiped away the tears that continued to fall. “But I feel like this could really complicate things!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Babies tend to do that! But they can also be a blessing!” Lilia reached up, wiping away the remaining tears. “As I said when we first sat down, keep an open mind! She could be afraid to tell you! Not sure how you’ll react?” Lilia raised her eyebrows. “I mean, think of it from her perspective. Who knows how far along she is? Or how it happened? Maybe she didn’t know when you first met? And you, my dear, were your oh-so-charming self and swept her off her feet. And then that one wild Saturday the month before turns into a happy accident. All I'm saying is, despite how improbable it may be, it’s the situation you’re in and you need to decide if you care enough about this woman to stick around. Because if not - you need to step away now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I think that depends on a lot of things! I have several questions ping ponging through my mind right now!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s understandable!” Lilia brought her hands up to rest on Rio’s shoulders. “If this were anyone else, I’d probably tell you to run for the hills, but I see the way she looks at you…Like you hung the stars and moon. Despite all she may be dealing with, that woman adores you!” Rio cracked half a smile. “And I know how you feel about her!” Lilia hummed. “All I’m saying is it’s worth hearing out.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s breathing finally relaxed as she let all that Lilia had said sink into her. “You had to do this before I planned to spend an entire week with her didn’t you!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s a great opportunity to figure things out! Besides, you’ll have all that driving time to contemplate!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And now I have to go to work!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I am sorry about that!”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>————————————————</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s entire shift had been a blur. Luckily it was uneventful and she could bury herself in paperwork and answering insurance claims. But the morning came too quickly and before she knew it she was sitting in the parking lot of the hospital in Lilia’s van. She had turned on the vehicle minutes ago but was just staring at her phone screen where Agatha’s last texts were taunting her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Hope you have a good last shift! I can’t wait to see you tomorrow! </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Good night, my love! Let me know when you hit the road in the morning! </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Morning hon! I can’t believe I get to see you today! </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio hadn’t replied to any of them. She was swirling about everything that lay before her. She had been so excited, so sure, then Lilia had to bring her crashing down. She wanted to run. She wished she could run and just forget the last few months like it never happened. But Agatha consumed her every thought. The woman had made her feel whole and loved. For the first time in a long time she felt sure of herself and excited about her future. And Lilia was right, she deserved to find the answers to her questions. Before she could psych herself out any further she typed out a message to Agatha,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Morning, mi amor! I’m headed your way. See you in a few hours. 😘 </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>and pulled out of the parking lot. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—————————————————</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The whole first hour was silent. She was heavy with dread. She bounced between worst and best case scenarios, running through every possible question. Would Agatha leave her? Would she have to leave Agatha? Could she leave Agatha? Why didn’t she feel like she could tell her? Was this yet another trauma that had been inflicted upon her? Was it a one night stand? Given all Agatha had told her that seemed the most unlikely. But the whole situation seemed unlikely. Had it not been for the bag of test strips tucked away in her suitcase she would have thought the whole thing was a fever dream Lilia had cooked up. Even with the “evidence” she had her doubts. She needed to hear Agatha say it before she could really believe it. But how would she even begin </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> conversation?  </span>
<em>
<span>My love, is there anything you’re keeping from me? Anything you’d like to share? I promise I won’t be upset, just tell me what’s going on?! </span>
</em>
<span>No, she had to be subtle. Let Agatha tell her on her own terms. Let her know that she was safe to tell her, that she wouldn’t run for the hills and leave her stranded, unless of course there was someone else. She shook that thought away, she couldn’t get ahead of herself, one step at a time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She could hardly begin to imagine what Agatha must be feeling. Did she know when they first started dating? Would she really have agreed to the date if that had been the case? She imagined, for a moment, what if the roles had been reversed? Not that she could ever imagine herself in that position, but what if? Would she have the heart to tell Agatha right away? </span>
<em>
<span>Cariño, I know we’ve only been dating a couple months but by the way, I’m pregnant. Is that going to be an issue? </span>
</em>
<span>That conversation seemed just as, if not more, difficult than the one she actually needed to have. All around it was an impossible situation. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She let her mind wander to the potential futures. One without Agatha, without her light, and laughter, and all the joy and love she had brought into her life. How empty it would feel, like getting a taste of heaven then being starved for eternity. The shell of the life she wanted to live. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then for a second she let herself dream. Spending her life with Agatha and this child. Just the three of them. Her own little family. She had almost given up on having any semblance of the family life she grew up with, but now. It was wrapped with a bow on a silver platter. The woman of her dreams and a child with whom she could share all her love and knowledge and adventures. If she really asked herself what </span>
<em>
<span>she </span>
</em>
<span>wanted it would be that. A family that she could love and share the rest of her life with. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then the question is, is that what Agatha would want? Would she trust her enough to keep her around? She hadn’t trusted her enough to tell her, and yet, they were set to spend the week together. Maybe she was planning to come clean, like Lilia said, it’d be a good chance to talk things through. If she could convince Agatha that she wanted this, wanted her, more than anything else, they could try and make this work. Her heart jumped at the thought. Maybe she could have the best of all possible worlds. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After stopping for gas about halfway she resigned herself to come up with a plan. She would wait a couple days, give Agatha a chance to tell her and explain things on her own. Maybe ask a few unassuming questions, and on day three, if Agatha hadn’t said anything, she would find some way to bring it up. She really hoped it wouldn’t come to that. Until then she’d keep tabs and see if she noticed any indication that Lilia was right. She could still be wrong, but for now she had to prepare herself for that to not be the case. After all, Lilia was rarely wrong. Even now she had been right about the drive helping to set her mind straight. Satisfied with her plan she turned on some music and attempted to relax as best she could for the rest of the journey. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—————————————————-</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Right at 2:00 Rio pulled through the gate of the estate into a circular driveway. In the center was a large weather worn fountain featuring the Virgin Mary pouring water out of her hands. </span>
<em>
<span>Heh!</span>
</em>
<span> She laughed at the irony of it. The </span>
<em>
<span>other</span>
</em>
<span> immaculate conception. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She pulled the van up in front of the door of the large gothic mansion that was Agatha’s family estate. The building was ominous, made of dark grey and black stones stacked to peaks that each housed a cross at their steeple. A very stark contrast to the colorful and whimsical childhood home Lilia and her mother had fostered. This felt like a church, in every oppressive sense of the word. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She grabbed her bag and the bouquet of flowers, she had been debating on bringing but was now glad she had, and walked up to the solid oak door. She had to put her bag down to properly maneuver the ornate knocker, and knocked three times. She picked up her bag as a flurry of butterflies filled her stomach. Her heart began to beat out of her chest as she heard footsteps behind the door. She thought she might faint as the door handle clicked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Then there she was. Hair piled up in a chaotic bun, black glasses askew, a fitted black tank top underneath a large fuzzy cardigan and slouchy jeans. She had the biggest grin on her face as soon as she realized it was Rio and rushed out to smother her in a hug. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh my gods! I can’t believe you’re actually here!” She shrieked with joy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know, me neither!” Rio mumbled half heartedly, in a fuzzy sense of non-reality. Like everything was happening around her. She felt Agatha’s body pressed against her. She took a deep breath through her nose, savoring the ever familiar lilac and honeysuckle, tinged with a spicy punch of ginger and creamy note of tonka. She let her fingers wind their way through Agatha’s tangles, finding a soothing comfort. </span>
<em>
<span>This </span>
</em>
<span>felt like home. She peeled herself away, “Here, my love, for you!” She held out the bundle of white roses and baby’s breath, then reached out and kissed Agatha’s hand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You are always so good to me!” She leaned in and snuck a quick kiss on Rio’s lips. “If I knew any better I’d say you love me!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio quirked a smile, “More than you know, Cariño!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha grabbed her hand and pulled her inside. The floor creaked beneath their feet as Agatha guided them through a labyrinth of books and boxes, many stacked taller than they were. Every now and then she’d catch a grandfather clock, an instrument, or some taxidermied animal, until Agatha led them through a swinging wooden door into the expansive kitchen. An enormous marble island dominated the room. An ancient gas range took up the far wall like an iron monster. Cabinets and a deep farmhouse sink were aligned against the back wall with enormous atrium windows that looked out onto the back property. Unlike the rest of the house she’d seen, the black and white kitchen was completely spotless, save for a smattering of snacks Agatha returned to eating. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh I’m so glad you made it alright! I actually just stopped for a snack break as you can see, this place is worse off than expected. And now I’m ravenous!” She moved to dig around in the fridge for items to add to her feast. “Can I get you anything to eat? Drink? I don’t have much, we’ll have to go to the store sooner rather than later.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll just take a water. I’m actually quite tired.” Rio yawned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, honey! I bet you are! Working then driving all that way!” Agatha said with loving concern. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>And stressing about you the entire time, </span>
</em>
<span>Rio thought. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Here’s a bottle of water. I’ll take you to the bedroom. Follow me!” She grabbed a handful of nuts then headed out the swinging door, Rio closely behind her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t worry, the upstairs doesn’t look nearly as bad, I brought most things down yesterday and this morning.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“By yourself?” Rio asked, a little concerned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah! I mean, some things i couldn’t, they just need two people, but everything else I managed alright.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Should you really be lifting heavy things?” Rio asked, more concerned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I may look delicate but I could probably out squat you! Though I will say it hasn’t done any favors for my back. It’s been so sore.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Huh</span>
</em>
<span>, thought Rio, </span>
<em>
<span>not the response I would have expected. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They climbed the ancient staircase and headed down a long dark hallway until they reached a creaky wooden door. It opened up to a window filled circular room. Thick curtains hung, ceiling to floor. A wooden four poster bed was aligned against the back wall. The room was covered in a dark plum floral wallpaper, giving the otherwise bright room a rather cave like feeling. There were two Victorian arm chairs and a table set by one of the windows. A wooden vanity and large oval mirror adorned the side wall, opposite the only other door in the room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Bathrooms through there when you need it.” Agatha said pointing to the door. “I’m going to run down and put away that food. I’m not sure but there may be mice.” She shrugged then sauntered back out of the room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio dropped her bag on the floor and collapsed onto the bed. Her head hurt, her body ached, and she was so exhausted from everything. Her head was still swirling, now with confusion more than anything, and she just needed a break. She slunk off her boots, flung them near her suitcase, and shimmied out of her work clothes before crawling into bed. She let out an exasperated sigh as her eyes drifted closed. She was nearly asleep when she heard the door creak open and footsteps patter in. She looked up to find Agatha, back toward her, shedding her tank top and jeans. Rio did her best to take a look at her, half asleep, as Agatha glided around the bed and joined her under the covers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha scooted in to rest her head on Rio’s chest and crook her leg across her body. She let out an equally tired sigh and curled in closer. In this home that had once been hers she had felt like a stranger up until now. Here in Rio’s arms she could finally settle and be at ease. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio rolled over to tangle her body with Agatha’s, tucking her head under her chin. She rubbed her hands soothingly down Agatha’s back, taking in every curve. She squeezed her as close as she could and savored the feeling. This calmness, this peace, before everything would change. For now she could let it just be her and Agatha. She wound her fingers back up to tangle in Agatha’s hair, letting the sensation soothe her further. Before long they were both deep in sleep. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—————————————————-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stirred first. She blinked her eyes open to the light of the setting sun leaking through the windows. She lifted her wrist from behind Agatha’s head, just enough so she could see the time. 6:35. They needed to get up. If for nothing else than to eat before going back to bed. She brought her hand down, stroking Agatha’s hair, as she took in the sleeping visage before her. Her voluminous waves sprawled out across the sheets and pillows. Her ivory white skin flushed with a rosy red glow in her cheeks. Her lips pressed together so that she was almost frowning. She looked so at ease with her arms draped over her head, like a woman in a romantic era painting. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio brought her hand down, daring to brush the back of her fingers against Agatha’s smooth cheek. They kept going, dancing down the length of her arm before resting on her hip. She held herself there in that moment, drinking in the peaceful warmth between them. Then she let her hand fall, landing to rest on Agatha’s lower abdomen. It was soft and fleshy, maybe a little distended, nothing particularly noticeable. As she left her hand there her heart started to flutter. Could there really be a life growing just on the other side of her palm? The idea of it now, after some sleep, after seeing Agatha, holding her, was exhilarating. She pressed her hand a little harder, not wanting to wake Agatha, but maybe feel some proof of her own. She waited, nothing, pressed a little further. Waited, nothing, as she went to press further she heard a mumble.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If you squeeze me any harder I’m going to pee the bed.” Agatha groaned as she stretched her body long. “What time is it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Almost 6:45. You hungry?” Rio asked. Agatha blinked herself more awake. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, now that you mention it, I could probably kill for a burger.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Great, want me to go pick something up?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, we’ll just get it delivered.” Agatha rolled out of bed and stumbled to the vanity where she grabbed her phone. Rio ogled her as she searched for a place to order from. She was slender, fit and curvy much like a Greek statue. Her breasts were full, nearly spilling out of the bra she was wearing, and in the space just below her belly button was an unassuming pooch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Here!” Rio’s gaze was broken by the phone that landed in her lap. “Order what you want, I put my order in and have a card on file. When you’re done, you can join me in the shower, if you’d like?” She winked at Rio and began to strip off her remaining clothes as she waltzed into the bathroom. Rio scrolled through the menu for a while before finally picking something and placing the order. She threw Agatha’s phone on the bed and made her way into the shower to join Agatha. Rio stood in the corner, cautiously looking her over as Agatha washed her hair. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You just going to stand there checking me out or are you gonna do something about it?” Agatha asked as she turned around to rinse her hair. Rio let out a nervous laugh as she moved Agatha out of the way to stand under the running water. “That’s not really what I had in mind!” Agatha joked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Later, mi amor! We can be as dirty as you want to be.” She leaned forward, wrapping her arms around Agatha’s shoulders and smothering her in a kiss. “Right now, I want to be clean, I feel disgusting.” They finished up in the shower, each found some clothes to change into and headed back down to the kitchen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So what’s the plan for this week?” Rio asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well tomorrow and Tuesday we have to get the rest of the stuff down to the second floor, outside of our bedroom that is, and, somewhat, sort through everything for the people holding the estate sale on Wednesday. That is going to be an all day thing! Then on Thursday I have cleaners coming to get the house ready for pictures on Friday so they can list it as soon as possible.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So you are selling the place?’</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh absolutely! You’ve seen it! It’s too much work, and I don’t want to be in Boston! I’ve already had loads of my Mother’s congregants at my door now that they know I’m in town. If I could get out of here sooner I would.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You ok if I pick up my stuff on Friday then, if we’re still planning to leave on Saturday?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah that should be fine, I can handle pictures on my own. Hey, if they get done early I can even come help you. But that might be a pipe dream, we’ll see how I feel after this week is over.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, if anything you should rest after the pictures. You’re already doing too much! Besides, that way I can take you to meet my friends for dinner on Friday before we head back.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That sounds like a plan!” They heard a knock at the door. “OOO that must be the food!” Agatha jumped up from where she was sitting on the counter and bolted for the front door. She came back quickly with the bag of burgers and fries, already stuffing a few in her mouth. “Gods! And I thought I was hungry before! I can’t get this burger in me fast enough!” She rifled through the bags and tore open the wrapper containing her burger just in time to sink her teeth in for a large bite. Rio chuckled at her in amusement as she slowly unwrapped her food. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did you forget to eat breakfast or something?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, I’ve been eating all day, I’m just so hungry after moving all this shit!” She took another large bite. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why do I smell peanut butter?” Rio asked as she looked around and in the bag. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That would be this. It has a peanut butter sauce, bacon, onion, pickles and mustard. OH and cheese!” Agatha took another bite, now having eaten nearly half of the sandwich. Rio grimaced at the idea of that combination. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not my top choice but so la voo, or whatever.” Rio clocked it as an odd craving. Agatha snorted and moved over to the fridge. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you want anything to drink besides water? I’ve got beer, soda, scotch?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Soda sounds good, I’ll take whatever you got.” Agatha handed her a coke as she pulled out a beer for herself and set it on the counter to look for a bottle opener. Rio opened her drink and paused as she looked confusedly at what was happening. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re having a beer?” She eventually asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, as soon as I can find a bottle opener.” Agatha replied as she searched through more cabinets. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You sure about that?” Rio asked, trying not to sound too concerned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Pretty sure burgers and beer go well together! AH! There it is!” She shouted as she pulled out the bottle opener and started to pry off the lid. Rio stared at her, confused and concerned, and then it hit her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>

<span>Does Agatha not know she’s pregnant?</span>

<span>From across the island Rio watched as Agatha lifted the bottle to her lips and took a few large gulps before setting it back down and taking another bite of her burger. Her mouth curled into a stunned smirk. She was conflicted, did Agatha really not know or was Lilia losing it? </span>
<em>
<span>Ok Lilia was definitely losing it. That shit with the pregnancy tests was over the line, </span>
</em>
<span>but, then again, it was proof! She took in every inch of Agatha as she ate. The way her tank top stretched at her chest. The slight curve of her stomach, peeking out from the bottom of her shirt, that pressed against the waistband of her pants. Her full glowing cheeks as she finished off the last of her questionable dinner choice. The beer gave her pause, but the evidence otherwise was piling up. This was going to be a completely different conversation than the one she had prepared for. In the meantime, she couldn’t let Agatha self sabotage, even if she wasn’t aware she was doing it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha reached for her beer and took another sip then noticed Rio staring at her. “What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Huh?” Rio snapped out of her contemplation. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why are you looking at me like that?” Agatha snorted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, uh, can I have some of that?” Rio asked, reaching for the bottle in Agatha’s hand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sure…” Agatha shrugged, as she handed her drink to Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I just want a sip.” Rio took the bottle and swirled the brown liquid. She cleared her throat and tipped the bottle back, emptying its contents. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey! I would have gotten you your own if I knew you were going to finish it.” Agatha grumbled, perturbed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio let out a loud burp, “My bad, you can have the rest of my soda if you want.” She scooted the can closer to Agatha who grabbed it frustratedly and chugged it out of spite. She set down the can with a look of discomfort and regret on her face before letting out an obnoxious belch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You good?” Rio chuckled </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That may not have been the best choice.” Agatha admitted before burping again. “Ugh, I’m so full!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I bet! You inhaled that sandwich!” She laughed. “You…uh…feeling ok otherwise?” She asked, changing the subject and wanting to glean any information she could. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, just tired mostly, and bloated! Gods, I hate flying. It always messes with my stomach. I’m sure this didn’t help but I swear, I felt like I was gonna die if I didn’t eat that burger!” She rubbed at her stomach in discomfort and walked over to take Rio’s hand and lean against her side. “How about you, how was your drive?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good, quiet, uneventful. Gave me time to think.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, yeah? What were you thinking about?” Agatha rested her chin on Rio’s shoulder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio turned her head to take in Agatha’s face. Her crystal clear blue eyes, that sleep was already tugging at, looked back at her with love and curiosity. She thought of all the scenarios she had run through trying to solve the situation before them. Seeing her now made her realize how futile that all had been. “You, mostly” she smirked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Me?” Agatha leaned back a bit, spreading her hand across her chest in mock flattery. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Us, really.” She smiled as she pulled Agatha in so her back was resting against her chest. Her arms cradled her low around Agatha’s stomach. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, </span>
<em>
<span>us.</span>
</em>
<span>” Agatha grinned as she leaned back pressing her cheek to Rio’s, “What about us?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, what our future might look like.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And what have you dreamed up for us, my love?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh you know” She hummed, “a house, 2 cars, 2.5 kids, some pets? Lots of adventures and mischief.” She squeezed Agatha lightly and began rubbing circles with her thumb across her abdomen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked back at her, a glimmer of grief and concern brewing in her mind. “Is that really what you want?” She asked hesitantly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That depends, what do you want?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked back into Rio’s eyes as she considered the question. “You.” She finally answered. “This.” She relaxed further into Rio. “I don’t really care about the rest. I just need you.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio hummed in agreement, hugging Agatha tighter and resting her chin on her shoulder. A swarm of conflicting emotions buzzed in her chest. She was relieved at how Agatha cared for her, how she truly needed her here. But that relief was soon squashed by concern. How could she not know? How could she not realize? Seeing her now, feeling her now, knowing everything, how was any of this possible? Would she have to tell her? How could she tell her? How could she begin to reason any of this? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m glad you came.” Agatha murmured in the shared silence. “I was absolutely dreading this.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Anything for you, my love!” Rio leaned down and kissed her shoulder. “I’m glad I came too.” Rio held her there, their bodies swaying gently, as she stilled her mind and savored the moment. And she knew, whatever was to come next, however this was to shake out, at the very least, they would face it together. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>————————————————</span>
</p><p>
<span>MONDAY:</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After a fitful night's sleep Agatha had them both up early cleaning and bringing more things downstairs. Rio spent most of the time running around trying to grab the heaviest things before Agatha could get to them. Even the things that needed both of them, she did her best to lighten the load as much as possible. Taking drawers out of dressers to carry them down. Heading down the stairs first to bear more of the weight. She encouraged Agatha to rest and eat while she made three times as many trips up and down the stairs. When they finished up in the late afternoon she was completely spent. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Though the entire first floor was now crammed with boxes, and paintings, and books, and furniture, they had managed to carve out a pathway to the living room where they left space to sit on the couch and turn on the television. While Rio sat and  flipped through channels looking for something to zone out to, Agatha stretched herself across the couch and dug into the many folders and documents the lawyer had given her when she collected the keys. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After settling on a nature documentary, Rio crawled to lie across Agatha. She rested her head against her stomach, listening to it gurgle, as she wrapped her arms around her waist. She turned to kiss her stomach and looked up seeing her face scrunched in concentration, “How are you feeling, my love?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked down from a document she was reading through the large black reading glasses dangling at the end of her nose to smile back at Rio. “I’m alright, hon!” She brought a hand down to tuck a piece of hair behind Rio’s ear. “Just trying to make sure I have everything in order to send over to the realtors. How are </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> feeling? You were practically sprinting carrying things down today!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m alright, just tired now. Ready for that pizza to get here so we can eat and go to bed.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll be surprised if you make it back up the stairs!” She chuckled, returning back to her documents. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I may not, we might be stuck here. I don’t think I can move, I’m too comfortable.” Rio said as she snuggled in further to Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t think my back would forgive me if I didn’t sleep in a bed tonight. I’ll carry you if I have to!” Agatha joked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No!” Rio shouted, a little louder than she meant to, startling Agatha. “I mean, I’ll crawl if I have to, but you’re not carrying anything else. You’ve already done too much.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked down at Rio concerningly. She was about to respond when there was a knock at the door. “That’ll be dinner.” She said as she put down the papers she was holding along with her glasses and moved to get up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, I got it!” Rio said, jumping up, “You…relax, I’ll be right back.” She ran to the front door before Agatha could argue. As she tipped the driver and closed the door behind her she turned to find Agatha walking across the entryway into the kitchen and followed her in. “I thought I told you to relax!” She chided </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha jumped, not expecting Rio to have followed her. “Fuck! You scared the shit out of me! I didn’t hear you come in.” She said as she grabbed two sodas from the fridge. “Just grabbing some drinks and plates. I was gonna meet you in there. I think I can handle that!” Agatha scoffed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright, I’ll let it slide, but anything else let me know and I’ll grab it for you.” Rio scolded</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You act like I’m made of glass!” Agatha snorted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I just…I know how much work you’ve been doing since you got here and we still have tomorrow to sort through things. I don’t want you to overdo it.” Rio rushed to explain. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thanks for the consideration, hon, but I think I can manage.” She patted Rio’s cheek before grabbing the plates and heading back out to the living room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They made quick work of the pizza before snuggling back into the couch and quickly dozing off, wrapped in each other. Eventually Rio awoke to the TV blaring an infomercial. She untangled herself from Agatha and got up to turn it off and put away their trash from dinner. When she returned Agatha was still deep in sleep on the couch, her hair covering her like a blanket, one arm flopped across her stomach, the other tucked tightly at her side with her hand pressed against her face. Her cheeks were pink with the heat of sleep. The visage of the glowing goddess before her, serene and peaceful, made her heart swell. She knelt down in front of the couch and brought a gentle hand up to rest on the ever so slight swell of her belly and leaned in close. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“Hey little one” </span>
</em>
<span>she breathed, barely more than a whisper. “</span>
<em>
<span>I don’t know where you came from, or how you got here.” </span>
</em>
<span>She paused, feeling Agatha stir, but she didn’t wake. “</span>
<em>
<span>I’m Rio, I’m gonna take good care of your mama, but I’m gonna need your help. She doesn’t know about you yet, so anything you can do to help me out, I’ll make sure you’re both ok.” </span>
</em>
<span>She leaned down and kissed the spot she had spoken to before looking back up at the sleeping Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She moved to sit on the couch and began brushing away strands of Agatha’s hair. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“My love!” She hummed. “I hate to wake you, but we should head up to bed.” She leaned over pressing a kiss to Agatha’s temple. Agatha groaned and stretched in response as her eyes fluttered open. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Who were you talking to?” She mumbled sleepily. Rio felt a chill go down her spine. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No one.” She quickly replied. “Just trying to wake you up.” Now was not the time for this conversation. Agatha hummed accepting that response and slowly moved to sit up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What time is it?” She asked, still blinking awake.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“12:30” Rio replied </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Aw! And you put the pizza away!” She smiled sleepily. Rio moved to help her off the couch and guided her up the stairs to the bedroom where they quickly fell back to sleep. Agatha cradled in Rio’s arms which wrapped lovingly around her belly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—————————————————</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>TUESDAY:</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha awoke to the smell of bacon and coffee wafting up the stairs to the bedroom. She rolled over in the empty bed to grab her phone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>9:45</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Damn, she had planned to get up at 8! They had another full day of sorting through everything and she was already behind. </span>
<em>
<span>Why didn’t Rio wake her? </span>
</em>
<span>As she sat up at the edge of the bed she could feel the weight of the last few days settle upon her. Her feet were stiff and swollen, her back twinged in pain, heartburn was already brewing in her chest from the pizza last night. Maybe Rio was right about overdoing it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She stumbled out of bed, slid on some pants and the robe Ralph had gotten her, and headed down to the kitchen. As she opened the door she was met with a buffet of eggs, bacon, toast, potatoes and peppers, fresh fruit, and an assortment of baked goods and juices. “What’s all this?” She chuckled sleepily. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio turned from putting away ingredients in the fridge. “Good morning, my love! Did you sleep well?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha moved to sit on a stool at the island. “Yes, perhaps a little too well! Why didn’t you wake me?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I wasn’t going to disturb you, you looked way too comfortable. Besides, we have another big day ahead of us. I wanted to make sure you got the rest you needed.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio handed her a mug from which she immediately took a sip. “This isn’t coffee.” She choked as she swallowed the ginger lemon tea. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, sorry, I accidentally bought whole beans when I went to the store and couldn’t find a grinder. Hope that’s ok for now.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’ll do.” She replied disappointedly before tucking into the elaborate breakfast Rio had prepared. “What sparked this idea?” She asked as she bit into a piece of toast, gesturing to the plates of food around them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well I was going to surprise you with breakfast in bed but this all took a little longer than I expected.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You didn’t have to do that!” She smiled through a mouthful of eggs and bacon. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Maybe not, but I wanted to.” She pulled up a stool next to Agatha. “So, for today, since we have to organize and catalogue everything, I figured we could go room by room, you log what everything is and then I’ll sort things into groups, move things around.” Rio offered</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That could work. Are you sure you’re not too tired from all the running around you did yesterday?” She smirked as she took another sip of her tea, which she had forgotten was tea, and frowned as she choked it down. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, I’m feeling great! I’ll be all fueled up here in a bit and then we can get started.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>By the time they finished and cleaned up breakfast it was nearly 11:00. They sorted through hundreds of books, and cabinets, and odds and ends, organizing everything for the estate sale company in the morning. Agatha sat in the middle of the room noting as much as she could about the pieces around her. Rio bounced from room to room adding like thing to like thing until there were several distinct groupings in each room. When all was said and done they had organized and logged tens of thousands of items and as they checked the clock it was nearly midnight. The people were coming early the next morning so they tucked quickly into bed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio laid awake for another hour as Agatha quickly fell asleep. She kept turning over and over the conversation she was still yet to have in her head. The timing was tricky with all they had coming up these next few days, but she reasoned they’d have to find something to do while the cleaners were at the house on Thursday and she could plan out the day and find a good time and place to bring it up with her. Resolute in this decision she turned to spoon Agatha, crooking a leg beneath hers and bringing her arm around her chest to pull her close. She nuzzled her nose in Agatha’s hair at the crook of her neck, breathing in the warm, spicy, floral fragrance and quickly falling asleep. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>————————————————</span>
</p><p>
<span>WEDNESDAY:</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mind had started working on the day ahead before the alarm went off and she was fully awake. She mentally rechecked every list she had made a dozen times and was still sure she was forgetting something. She moved to crawl over Rio and turn off the alarm as she made her way to the bathroom to relieve herself. She still felt so bloated and the heartburn was back again. They needed to pick something other than greasy takeout for dinner tonight. All of that wasn’t helped by the overwhelming hollow feeling she had about the task ahead. She had thought she would feel relief, or maybe grief about selling all her family’s possessions but instead there was this well of emptiness that left her body tingling and numb. Had it not been for the ball of nerves swimming in her stomach, she might have thought she wasn’t even alive. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio slowed to pry herself from the sheets but as her feet hit the ground so did the realization. She was going to talk to Agatha tomorrow. </span>
<em>
<span>HOW?</span>
</em>
<span> What would she say? How could she bring it up casually? Would Agatha be angry? She’d probably be scared. Would she try to run? Feeling the thoughts spiraling she forced herself to the bathroom in search of Agatha. As she saw her at the sink, running her fingers through her hair and pinning it up in a messy bun, she felt a rush of relief. She eased forward and wrapped her arms around Agatha’s waist, pressing herself against Agatha’s back, and tucked her head down in the hollow of her arm and neck pressing kisses at the nape. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha startled at the sudden contact but quickly relaxed into Rio’s touch. Her warmth spread quickly, bringing her out of the purgatory she had woken up in. “Well, good morning to you too, my love!” She giggled as Rio peppered kisses across her neck and shoulder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio gave Agatha another squeeze and grumbled in a husky morning voice, “How are you feeling, Cariño?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted, “You keep asking me that! You sound just like Lilia!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I just want to make sure, this is a lot for anyone let alone…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m fine!” Agatha snapped. Seeing the shock on Rio’s face at her reply, she realized that may have been harsher than she intended. “Ok, maybe I’m a little nervous for today, but I’m sure it’ll be fine. I’m just glad it’ll be over soon.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Exactly! Everything will work out.” She said half to herself. “We just have to see it through, together.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha turned to face Rio, throwing her arms around her neck, “Have I mentioned how glad I am that you’re here?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged, “Once or twice, perhaps?” she smirked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, remind me to show you how </span>
<em>
<span>grateful</span>
</em>
<span> I am later!” She bit her lip, batting her eyes up at Rio, then looked down at her pillowy lips and swallowed them in a passionate kiss. After a moment she broke away abruptly with a wicked grin on her face. She winked at Rio and rushed out of the bathroom to finish getting ready. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stood stunned for a moment, her reflection staring her back in the bathroom mirror. She let out a soft chuckle as conflicted feelings of curiosity, doubt, and amusement rushed through her mind. In the end she wasn’t sure if her arousal or the awareness of their situation would win out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha wandered back into the bathroom to locate her glasses and leaned over to kiss Rio on the cheek, “I’m headed downstairs to get breakfast ready, the estate sale people should be here in about 30 mins to get started.” This finally brought Rio back to reality and she moved to get ready. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Before long Rio bounded down to the kitchen to the smell of coffee and burnt toast. She opened the door to a stack of questionably crisp bread, a couple bowls of fruit, some yogurt and granola, and Agatha frantically wiping down the counter near the coffee machine. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you need some help, my love?” Rio giggled</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha whipped around flashing a less than convincing smile at Rio. “No, no! I’m all good over here, you sit down and eat! Want some coffee?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did you manage to find a grinder?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, no, not at all! What I did find was a mortar and pestle and smashed the shit by hand. Honestly, it helped with the nerves, I feel great now!” She grimaced as she took a sip of the coffee she made. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Based on that look, I’ll pass on the coffee.” Rio snickered and took the least burnt piece of toast. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know you bought decaf right?” Agatha asked, raising her eyebrows</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hmm” Rio hummed in feigned innocence. “Oops, must have grabbed the wrong bag by mistake. Sorry about that!” she followed up with a smile of apology. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, I’ll suffer through today because at least it’s coffee.” Agatha took another sip.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So, can you remind me what the plan is for tomorrow?” Rio choked out through a bite of toast. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well there are people coming in the morning to collect whatever doesn’t sell today. Then the cleaners are supposed to be here at 1 to do the whole house.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So we should probably be out of the house while they’re here?” Rio asked. Agatha nodded in reply. “Would you want to go wander around downtown? I can show you some of my favorite spots? We can go out for dinner?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, “That sounds great! It’ll be nice to get out of this house for a bit. It’s making me uneasy.” She said as she rubbed at her side with a look of discomfort on her face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You alright, Cariño?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, “Yes, dear! I just have this weird spasm. It’s nothing, I’m sure it’ll go away on its own.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio laughed anxiously, “Yeah, of course. I’m sure it will.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Before long the house was bustling with people, those from the company Agatha hired, some there to sort through and purchase items, and many who were there out of sheer curiosity having wondered about the house for ages. More than once Agatha found people wandering up the stairs like it was an open house and did her best to block it off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio milled about pretending to be an interested party whenever someone was checking out an interesting item and did her best to convince them she might snatch it out from beneath them if they didn’t make a quick decision. She had just finished her latest mark, whom she convinced to purchase a rather interesting taxidermy tableau, when she spotted her next victim. A tall, slender, severe looking woman with her black and grey hair pulled back into a tight bun. She wore modest dark heels with a muted grey A-line dress that came down past her knees. Rio mozied over, glancing at a few other items along the way, before she landed on the same ornate wooden chair the woman was staring at. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Interesting piece!” She mumbled, crossing her arms and bringing a hand up to her chin in consideration. “It piqued my interest earlier, it’d be a great addition to my living room. Where were you thinking of putting it?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woman chuckled to herself then turned to face Rio. “Are you one of the people she hired to help sell things?” she asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Excuse me?” Rio chuckled, a bit taken aback.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I saw you convince that man to buy those animals, and the lady over there to purchase the silver tea set. Do you get commission or something?” The woman asked snidely. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio leaned back, tucking her tongue into the side of her cheek and tilting her head to the side. “Actually, I’m here with the owner personally.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, is that so?” The woman grinned slyly. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was talking with someone about the house when she saw a child crossing her makeshift barrier and rushed to catch him and return him to his parents. As she handed him back she searched the house for Rio. She entered the family room and saw her in a corner nodding amusedly at an older woman she was in deep conversation with. As Agatha caught her attention Rio gave her a wave and cheeky smile, flashing her big brown eyes in her direction, almost pleading for an intervention. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha started to head toward Rio when she heard the woman’s harsh and piercing voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you have any idea how long this house has been under the same family? It’s a disgrace is what it is! An embarrassment!” A cold chill ran down Agatha's spine as she rushed to Rio’s side. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“There you are! I was wondering where you ran off to.” Rio called out as Agatha approached. I’ve just been chatting with…” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Evanora Harkness” the woman hissed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh!” Rio’s eyes bulged at the realization. “Nice to meet you, I guess. Dr. Rio Vidal, I’m dating your daughter.” She smiled brightly and offered her hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Evanora grimaced and ignored Rio’s introduction, turning all her attention to Agatha. “I should have suspected as much. You were never able to resist the pull of sin at your heart. And look at you, barely able to put down the fork either, apparently.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What are you doing here?” Agatha snapped at Evanora, ignoring her snide comments.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Isn’t it obvious? I came for my things before they’re sold to the highest bidder! Seeing as I didn’t get the courtesy of a phone call before you let the rabble stampede through our home taking what they like. I figured I’d come and salvage what I could.” She chided, “ Agatha! How could you?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How could I?! How could you?! Look at this place?! It’s practically falling apart! Looking after it all these years was your responsibility.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well then I guess it’s good that it ended up with </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> since I’m so incapable of caring for it. Though I did for nearly 40 years! With no help from anyone! And who does he leave everything to?” Evanora huffed out an exasperated breath. “And now you’ve decided to sell everything! Figures you’d only agree so you could siphon off any money you could, one way or another. You’ve always been so selfish, so disrespectful, so ungrateful.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s rage built at the triggering insults. “Oh, and what exactly am I supposed to be grateful for? Huh? Being punished for who I was? Being beaten when I couldn’t obey your puritanical rules? You kicking me out? </span>
<em>
<span>You</span>
</em>
<span> cutting me off?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Enough!” Evanora commanded, but Agatha could no longer hold herself back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“NO! You have the audacity to show up here! After everything! After sending that weirdo lawyer after me! And for what? A few trinkets? Are you really that desperate? Are you really that jealous of your own daughter?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, you insolent, wicked child! I rue the day God cursed me with such a daughter! I would have rather buried you the moment you left my womb than have to stand here and listen to this tirade against me!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well maybe it wouldn’t be such a tirade if you weren’t such a </span>
<em>
<span>bitch</span>
</em>
<span> of a mother!” Agatha felt the sting of Evanora's slap before she could register what had happened. Her vision went blurry for a moment and then the world around her moved in a muffled haze. She could see and hear Rio shouting and confronting Evanora. She felt hands move around her shoulders as a few people standing nearby guided her to the kitchen where she was handed a glass of water and a bag of ice. She sat there for a moment, as the reality of what had happened washed over her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Moments later Rio burst through the kitchen door looking for Agatha, “Ah! Mi amor!” She rushed to kneel before Agatha as she looked up into her tear filled eyes, her hands gently coming up to cradle her face and lift the ice pack. She twinged looking at the bright red mark growing darker across Agatha’s cheek. “I’m so sorry! I should have stepped in sooner!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s alright. I’m alright.” She breathed through tears streaking down her face. She could feel the adrenaline begin to subside and a shaky uneasiness creep into her limbs. She took a breath to steady herself and smiled unconvincingly at Rio. “Believe me.” She huffed “I’ve had worse.” She took a sip of water and threw the ice pack on the island. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s hands shifted down to squeeze Agatha’s shoulders in comfort. Her eyes were stuck on the indigo pools of blue brimming with fear and anger yet stilled by calloused experience. She didn’t look surprised, only resigned. Agatha broke away from Rio’s grasp and moved to shakily stand. She wiped the tears from her face and straightened out her clothes then made her way to the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio rushed to catch her by the arm. “Agatha! Where are you going?” She asked alarmed </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha turned to look at Rio’s hand clutching her wrist then up to Rio’s eyes. “I’m just going to go talk to the coordinator.” She said, attempting to sound casual. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio drew her closer, “I can talk to the coordinator. You should sit down, that was a lot.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio, I’m fine!” Agatha protested, though the tears returning to her eyes denied the claim</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No you’re not fine, because that was not ok what just happened out there!” Agatha stood there silently as Rio’s words crashed into her. “You don’t need to pretend it was. You don’t need to prove anything!” She could feel the tears streaming now as if a dam had burst, though she didn’t make a sound, merely gritted her teeth holding on to her last bit of control as her lower lip quivered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio could feel Agatha lose resistance and she pulled her in, cocooning her with her body. She felt Agatha’s final resolve melt away at the embrace and the emotions overcome her. She held her there as Agatha fell apart in her arms, not daring to move until the sharp inhales of her crying slowed. She brushed her fingers through her hair, pulling it away from her face, as she moved back to look into Agatha’s tear stained eyes. “I’m so sorry, my love! You didn’t deserve that!” Rio soothed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why did it have to be her?” Agatha hiccuped as the final sobs dissipated and her eyes stung from drying tears. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head in sympathy, unsure of what to say, and brought a hand up to graze a thumb over the welt on Agatha’s cheek. She watched as Agatha involuntarily flinched at the touch and drew her hand back. “That woman is never coming anywhere near you again if I have anything to say about it.” Agatha cracked a smile in response. “Why don’t you go lie down. I’ll talk with the coordinator and come check on you in a bit.”  </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha went upstairs, Rio went and handled the coordinator along with the police who someone had called. She reassured them all that as long as Evanora was evicted and banned from the property there would be no further issues. Once she was sure everything was settled she went upstairs to check on Agatha. She found her on the bed, hair sprawled out around her, lying on her side with her knees tucked in, staring out the window. She silently edged her way onto the bed gliding a hand along Agatha’s arm as a comforting awareness of her presence. Slowly Agatha turned to look at her, eyes silvery grey in the haze of sadness. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Please,” she croaked, voice weary from crying “Hold me.” Rio didn’t hesitate, she moved to lie down, sliding her knees under Agatha’s and wrapping an arm around her waist to pull her close. Agatha grabbed Rio’s arm and hugged it tightly, brushing Rio’s fingers across her lips for comfort, breathing in her earthly grounding scent. Before long her body ached with tiredness as the heaviness of the event settled upon her. In Rio’s arms, with her warmth pressed against her back, she relaxed and quickly fell asleep. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha awoke to a dark room, the only light flooding in from the moonlight streaming through the windows. She rolled over to find an empty bed though the smell of garlic and onion rose from the kitchen below. She reached over to check the time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>8:47</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She had slept the entire afternoon and into the early evening. She stretched as she moved to get out of bed and hobbled to the bathroom. As she flipped on the lights she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror. Her face was puffy from all the crying, Her left cheek was red and slightly swollen with a scratch right in the middle. It was tender but not particularly painful, she just hoped it didn’t leave a bruise. The scratch would heal in a few days just fine. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Though it had been a very long time, this was not the first incident like this. </span>
<em>
<span>Spare the rod and spoil the child</span>
</em>
<span> was cross stitched into a placard which hung above the paddle that Evanora bore down upon her at any sight of disobedience. When she was very young the tears and the pleading would come almost immediately. She would beg for her mother to stop with no avail. When that punishment had run its course and Evanora could no longer get a response to her thrashings, she had Agatha kneel on rocky ground in prayer until she had paid her pennants. She was quick to smack for back talk and disrespect and would even withhold food should she see the crime great enough. All this in service of the Lord. It was an unbearable childhood filled with fear and obstinance. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha had clawed her way out at 18, never intending to interact with Evanora again. She had built a life for herself over and over and over again, despite her mothers interferences. She wasn’t going to let her ruin things for her here and now. Now she had Rio, she had someone else in her corner sticking up for her, defending her. She didn’t feel alone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She washed her face with cool water, calming the irritation and cleaning off her streaked makeup. She threw her hair in a quick bun, changed into one of Rio’s T-shirts and pajama pants and headed down to find her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She quietly pushed open the kitchen door finding Rio stirring something in a pot on the stove. The air was thick with aromatics and the smell of baking bread. Rio turned, surprised to see Agatha out of bed, and rushed to meet her at the island. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What are you doing up? I was just about to come check on you!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I smelled something cooking down here and came to investigate.” She gave a half smile. “What are you making?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Chicken Pozole, it’s just about ready. I figured soup would be just what today called for. How are you…” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How am I feeling?” Agatha cut her off, raising her eyebrows as her smile grew. “Much better after some sleep. Though my body is still exhausted. Honestly everything hurts and that spasm is back, right at my ribs.” She croaked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’ve been doing too much and today was…a lot to say the least. You need to take it easy. Have some pozole ” Rio guided her to a stool then headed to the oven to pull out the baguette she was heating. She ladled a bowl for each of them, sliced the bread and brought it all over to where Agatha was sitting. Rio immediately started eating, having waited as long as possible for Agatha, and expected her to do the same. Instead she just stared down at the bowl haplessly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If you’d like I could make you something else?” She offered </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked up from the food, “Oh, no, you don’t need to do that. I just don’t think I’m very hungry at the moment.” The events of the day flashed back in pieces. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio looked back resolute, “You said this morning you’d show me how glad you are to have me here, yes?” Agatha nodded, a look of perplexed amusement on her face as she was drawn back into the moment. “Then eat. Trust me, it’ll help.” Rio smiled as she tore off a piece of bread. “And when we’re done I’m going to draw you a bath” she leaned over and kissed Agatha on the side of the head then returned to eating her soup. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha had so many questions, about the rest of the day, about what happened with Evanora, about their plans tomorrow. Yet, even after her long nap she found herself too tired to speak. She resolved to eat at least a few bites, as she hadn’t really eaten since that morning. As soon as the food hit her tongue she could feel her body begin to relax. The soup was indeed the perfect remedy; light, and warm, and comforting. It filled the hollow cracks left by her mother and replaced it with the love Rio had shown her. Any residual concern or doubt was banished and she surrendered to the care Rio was showing her. The questions could wait for another day. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>——————————————————-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>THURSDAY: </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio slid out of bed as the sun was rising and headed out for a morning jog. She needed to think clearly. Today she would have to play by ear, as she wasn’t sure how Agatha would be feeling when she woke up. The events of the day before had been jarring and Rio felt her overwhelming desire to protect Agatha, and the child she didn’t know she was carrying, grow even stronger. She would find a time, find a way to talk to her, but she would have to take Agatha’s lead. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As she arrived home she headed upstairs to check on Agatha. Her body was tangled in a mess of sheets and hair as the soft breath of slumber whispered in the room. She tiptoed in to grab her wallet and keys and headed out to get coffee and pastries before the people came to take what was left of the stuff downstairs. Luckily it wasn’t much since after the incident word spread and dozens people from around the area came to hear the drama with many who ended up walking out with a souvenir or two. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As Rio pulled into the bakery lot she got a text:</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Yelena - Hey! Vidal, are we still on for tomorrow? </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio - Yeah, you still good to meet me at the storage unit in the morning? </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Yelena - Yeah, what time?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio - 10?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Yelena - That works. We still meeting Nat and Hela for dinner?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio - That’s the plan, at least for now. I’ll need to double check that Agatha’s still up for it. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Yelena - Uh-oh! Trouble in paradise?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio - Yes and no. We can talk about it tomorrow. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Yelena - Cool. See you then. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio quickly returned home, breakfast in hand, nerves a little on edge at the thought of the day ahead. She could hear the water running as she entered and knew Agatha was up and moving at least. She stopped by the kitchen and grabbed a couple plates then headed up to her. As she opened the bedroom door she could smell the lavender and rosemary of Agatha’s shampoo wafting in on clouds of steam billowing out of the bathroom. She set their meal out on the vanity and collapsed back onto the bed running through what she was going to say and when she should say it. Before long she heard the door creak and sat up to see Agatha in the doorway, steam flowing out of the bathroom around her, nothing but a towel on her head. Rio stared in awe as she walked over and planted a kiss on her forehead. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Where did you wander off to?” She cooed. Rio, speechless, nodded towards the treats she had purchased. “Oh my gosh, is that an iced latte?” Agatha rushed over and took a sip, humming in satisfaction before digging into a chocolate croissant. Rio’s eyes once again wandered over Agatha, now in her natural form. The rosey blush of her face from the shower she took, smooth and glowing save for the scratch across her left cheek. The heaviness of her breasts dotted with hershey kiss nipples. The curved swell of her ass cheeks matching the ever present swell of her stomach. She was mesmerizing, radiant, like witnessing a deity.  Her eyes eventually landed back at Agatha’s which were peering back at her along with a smirk. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“See something you like?” She quipped as she took another bite of the croissant. Rio nodded and stood, still silent, and padded over to Agatha, wrapping her arms around her waist and drawing her in for a kiss. She pulled apart to look back into her eyes and said, “You, of course”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned back and chuckled, “GAY!” Snorting in laughter as she took another bite of the croissant and moved to get ready. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You still up for going out later?” Rio asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Definitely, I need to get out of this house before I lose it!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fair enough. I figured we could go to a museum, maybe hit up a couple book shops, then we could go somewhere for dinner?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That sounds perfect! Really, I just need some quiet time away, not thinking about this stupid house, or my mother, or anything stressful or upsetting. I just want to have a nice time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed uncomfortably, “I…uh…can make that happen.” She</span>
</p><p>
<span>grinned, secretly cringing on the inside. Given Agatha’s demeanor she wasn’t going to resign herself to defeat just yet, but she knew this was going to be extremely tender territory. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The salvage company arrived just as they were finishing breakfast. Though not many items were left it took the two guys they sent right up until the cleaners came to finish loading everything. Once Agatha was satisfied that the cleaners were set, she and Rio headed off to the Boston Art Museum. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know if I’ve ever been here.” Agatha admitted as the uber dropped them off at the entrance. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Really? Even when you were a child?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, of course not! Too many naked images, very sinful!” She let out a small laugh at the idea. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“OOO, then I guess we’ll have to keep our eyes peeled for anything scandalous!” Rio joked as she took Agatha’s hand in hers and led them inside. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They wandered into the first gallery of mainly ancient Greek and Roman statues and artifacts. Agatha stopped to read as many descriptions as possible while Rio bounced around imitating the positions of each statue she came upon, until Agatha would walk by and spot her causing one or both of them to erupt in giggles. The shenanigans continued as they moved to view 18th century European paintings. Agatha glided slowly from painting to painting taking in every detail and occasionally Rio would pop up behind her to add some obscene or witty commentary causing Agatha to snort. The entire time they were there Rio ensured there was a smile on her face or laughter flowing from her mouth. Keeping her relaxed and happy could only work well in her favor. As they exited a third gallery Agatha quickly found a bench to take a seat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You alright, my love.” Rio asked as she joined her on the bench.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, I’m alright, just needed to get off my feet for a bit. I’ve got that spasm again but it’s on the other side this time. It’s starting to get annoying” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Anything I can do?” Rio asked, knowing full well what the spasm was, and that there was nothing she could do about it except hope that it helped things click into place before she had to explain it to Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, I just want to rest for a minute before we check out that bookshop you mentioned. Oh and I’d love to grab a snack!” She added hopefully, as she was starting to feel tired again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Anything you want, mi amor!” She leaned over, kissing Agatha’s temple. “Just let me run to the restroom and we can head out.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exited the stall, feeling more confident than she had that morning. The little bean inside Agatha was making moves, Agatha was in a good mood, they had a great time at the museum. She was going to make sure the rest of the day went just as smoothly and then, it would be a breeze. She just had to ask her, just pull off the band-aid. She stared at herself in the mirror and began reciting what she wanted to say.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey Agatha, you are just so radiant, so </span>
<em>
<span>glowing</span>
</em>
<span>, is there any chance you’re pregnant?” She shook her head and tried another approach. “Hey, Agatha, what would you think about </span>
<em>
<span>us </span>
</em>
<span>having a kid? Maybe sometime soon? Who knows maybe that’s something you’re already working on?” She laughed at herself. </span>
<em>
<span>No, absolutely not that. Just be upfront with her</span>
</em>
<span>. “Hey, Agatha, you know that twitch you’ve got going on?  Is there a possibility you might be pregnant? Any chance?” It still didn’t feel right but definitely the right direction. She’d have to find a way to ease into the conversation. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She opened her mouth to try another phrasing when the door to the bathroom opened and Agatha walked in, startling her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, hey!” Rio said, a rush of panic running through her. “I was just finishing up here.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good to know, for a second I thought you might have fallen in.” Agatha chuckled as she walked hurriedly into a stall. Rio let out a breath of relief and headed out to wait for her. Despite her confidence, as soon as she saw Agatha her nerves shattered. It wasn’t just that she was afraid to tell her. That came with a whole host of worries! Would she deny it? Would she be angry? She was also afraid to find out the dirty details. Would Agatha leave her? Was there someone else? Would she let her be a part of the child’s life? Those thoughts still ran through her mind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As soon as she was out they hopped into another uber and were off to the bookstore. Rio fidgeted in her seat, anticipating the rest of the evening. She glanced over at Agatha who was leaning her head against the window, her eyes closed as she rested. She looked so peaceful after everything that had happened. Rio didn’t want to disrupt this calm if she could help it. Was now even the right time? If not it could cause more harm than good. Besides, everything she had tried in the bathroom felt idiotic! Was there maybe a way she could get Agatha to realize on her own? Maybe let them come to the conclusion “together” somehow? She’d continue to play it by ear this evening and if the opportunity felt right, if she could find a way to ease into it, she would jump on the chance. If not, then she’d have to come up with another plan. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Their car pulled up outside the store and Rio leaned over to wake Agatha, brushing a piece of hair behind her ear and taking her hand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Cariño, we’re here.” She hummed gently </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha breathed in as she returned to consciousness, blinking herself awake. “Oh shit!” She grumbled, “I did </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> mean to fall asleep!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s alright, just be careful getting out. I’ve got your things.” Rio jumped out of the car and headed around to help Agatha out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t know what’s going on with me! It's not like I haven’t gotten enough sleep lately. I had that coffee you got me this morning but I don’t think it helped at all.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Let’s head inside, they have a little cafe, we can get you a snack and a drink, that’ll help.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio guided her inside to a comfy armchair in the corner while she went and grabbed them both a pick-me-up as Agatha took her time to wake up fully. Rio returned shortly with their sustenance and sat down across from her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I got you another coffee and this snack pack thing with nuts and cheese and grapes and stuff.” Rio said as she leaned back, watching Agatha closely. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh, that’s perfect!” She sighed taking a sip of her coffee and digging into the snacks. She had eaten half the box before realizing Rio was staring at her. “What?!” Agatha asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hmm?” Rio replied with raised eyebrows. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You keep staring at me! What?” She laughed, a little nervous. “You’ve been doing that all week.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed as she felt her stomach drop. Was now the time? She took a breath to settle her nerves and decided to test the waters. “I’m just worried about you. That’s all.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Worried? Is this about yesterday? I promise I'm fine. Hate to say I’m used to it but, with Evanora it comes with the territory. You see now why I avoid her if I can help it.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I mean yes, that is definitely near the top of my list of concerns. We didn’t really talk about this but officers were called, they said to follow up if you wanted to press charges. Would that be something you’d want to do?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, I’m not going to bother with that. I already have my lawyer working on a restraining order after dipshit showed up at my house. I hate to say I’m a little fuzzy on the details but, what exactly happened after she…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“After she hit you?” Rio let out a chuckle as she recalled what had followed. “Well, I’d love to say I kept my composure but it was a little difficult to restrain myself completely. I came this close to knocking her lights out but thought better of it and just shoved her. I guess she wasn’t expecting that and toppled over like a jenga tower.” She started laughing harder. “I wish you had seen the look on her face!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sat there dumbfounded yet amused, “Is…is she ok?” She asked hesitantly </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio calmed herself at Agatha’s response. “Yeah she’s fine, maybe a little shaken up. I helped her up and escorted her right out the front door. Told her to get the fuck out of there and don’t come back.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a lone chuckle, “In front of all those people?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, pleased with herself. “Absolutely! And we made a killing after that by the way.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I was wondering where everything went. I thought the salvage guys had shown up early. Damn, I bet she hated that!” Agatha finally laughed as she pictured the whole scene playing out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So you’re not upset?” Rio asked as she took a sip of her coffee. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No!” Agatha huffed. “If anything I’m incredibly turned on right now!” She raised her eyebrows and bit her lip before popping a piece of cheese in her mouth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio let out a breathy laugh as a blush rose in her cheeks. She took another sip of her coffee and stared at the cup. She was still unsure how she felt about </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> without talking to Agatha first. She sat for a moment as her storm of thoughts blew in once again. She felt her heart race and a tug of unease pull at her chest. Though the words danced on the tip of her tongue she couldn’t bring herself to do it. Now was not the time. They still had much to their day and bringing things up after talking about Evanora didn’t seem like the best idea. For now she needed to keep it light, there’d be plenty of time to talk later. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Feeling better?” She asked instead. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Much, that’s exactly what I needed.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good, then you won’t mind helping me with a book hunt?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know we could just ask somebody if they have the books you’re looking for.” She huffed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah but where’s the fun in that? I bet I can find more of them than you can!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is that a challenge?” She raised her eyebrows curiously. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Pretty sure it is! I’ll even give you a 5 minute head start because I have home field advantage.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh! How </span>
<em>
<span>generous</span>
</em>
<span> of you!” She scoffed. “Do you have a list?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I’ll text it to you. If you want to start at the top of the list I’ll start at the bottom, we’ll see where we meet up? Loser buys dinner?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh you are so on!” Agatha smirked as they both got up and walked to the checkout counter for the starting point. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright, I just sent you the list, I’ll give us 20 minutes overall. No asking the staff for help!” She leaned over giving Agatha a quick kiss, “and a kiss for good luck, you’re going to need it!” She winked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha grinned slyly and leaned in as if she was going for another kiss just to brush by and whisper in Rio’s ear “I’m going to crush you!” She gave her a peck on the cheek and sauntered off in search of the first book. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She took a quick glance at the list, Rio had 25 different books picked out, all in different genres and half the titles she didn’t recognize. Undeterred, she set her sights on the first book, finding it quickly in a featured author section. The next 3 were just as easy, finding them on end caps and display tables. As she went in search of number five she passed by Rio already carrying two books. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ok, you definitely didn’t wait the full five minutes!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh baby, I’m just getting started! Like I said, home field advantage.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha picked up her pace, eventually finding the fifth book. After finding 6 and 7 she passed by Rio again whose hands were curiously empty compared to the stack she was now balancing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Where are you putting them?” She asked, a little exasperated. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled seeing her confused struggle, “I just dropped them off at the front counter. You should do the same or it’s gonna slow you down.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed as she headed for the counter. She placed her stack of books near another stack, seemingly Rio’s, which already contained eight of the books. With renewed focus, determined not to be beat, she rushed off once again for the next on the list. She searched for the next one for some time and finally reasoned they were either out of stock or didn’t carry it and moved down the list. Her luck changed as she found the next three rather quickly and went back to place them with the other books she’d found. She caught Rio again as she was dropping off two of her own. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Better hurry, we’re getting down to the wire,  5 mins.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She quickly checked their stacks. They were close but Rio still had her beat by one. She rushed off again, having to search three different sections before she found the next two. She cut it close and was able to find one more before Rio found her and they walked back to the counter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you ready for the moment of truth?” Rio teased. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How close was it?” Agatha grimaced </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“My final count, 10.” Rio stated</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a burst of laughter. “14! Ha! Like I said,” she tossed her hair over her shoulder “Crushed you!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes and snickered. “Well done my love!” She leaned in for a celebratory kiss. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha broke away, a look of concerned curiosity on her face, “are you seriously buying all these books?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why not? I’ve got a lot of shelf space to fill.” Rio shrugged.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We’re not seriously going to carry these with us the rest of the night?!” She huffed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No! I’ll pay for them now and pick them up on Saturday on my way out.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a sigh of relief and moved to sit down and wait while Rio checked out. As she waited she felt the spasm return, this time back in its original spot. She pressed her hand to where it was, just under her ribs yet she was unable to feel anything. Figuring it was gas she made herself burp and the sensation quickly stopped. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Satisfied with her purchase Rio moved to join Agatha. “Any chance you’d be up to checking out another store before dinner? I know this one that specializes in old texts and first editions if you’re interested? It’s not far from here.” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I could be persuaded though I don’t want to stay too long. I’m already getting hungry again.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Deal!” Rio beamed. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>They headed out and down the street for about ten minutes until they reached a small dark shop with a few dusty books in the windows. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you sure it’s even open?” Agatha asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh yeah, it always looks that way.” Rio swung the door open and a bell rang above their heads. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The woody scent of old books was heavy as they entered the small shop. There was a counter with an old cash register in the back and every wall was stacked floor to ceiling with books of all sizes. There was a wooden chair in the corner with a small table and lamp set up as the perfect reading nook. Looking around it appeared they were the only people in the shop, no employees in sight. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Again, I have to ask, are you sure this place is open? There’s no one here!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, “Yeah, I’m sure Frank will be back up in a sec.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Frank?” Agatha asked just as one of the bookcases behind the counter started to open and a short, elderly, portly man with a ring of wispy hair around his balding head wandered out carrying a handful of books. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey, Frank! How’s it going?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio! Man, long time no see!” Frank wandered over to give Rio a hug. “What? You don’t like comin around to see me no more?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I moved Frank, I’m out in Westview now.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Westview? Where the fuck is that?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“New Jersey.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh man, you’re in fuckin Jersey? No shit! I got a couple cousins out there ya know!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t we all!” Rio joked “Hey, I actually came by to introduce you to someone.” She motioned for Agatha to join them. “Frank, this is Agatha.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh my god! Don’t tell me you found </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span> in Jersey! Frank Kelley, nice to meet you.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Likewise.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I worked for Frank a bit doing odd jobs during college.” Rio explained</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You lucked out, the kid can fix anything! I don’t know how she does it!” Frank praised. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Frank is an expert book hunter, particularly first editions, he can track nearly anything down you could think of.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I live for the thrill of the hunt!” Frank grumbled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How’s your son doing?” Rio asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh Dennis? He’s doing great, actually he and his wife just had a baby!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No shit! Congratulations man!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thanks, I’m a very proud grandfather to my new grandson! Eh, you wanna see some pictures? My son’s got ‘em loaded up on my phone.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Of course! Show me!” Rio replied. Frank fumbled with his phone for a moment before turning it around so they could look over him to see the photos. He scrolled through image after image of this tiny bundle of a human as he gushed about his love for the kid. Rio was completely engaged, commenting on each picture. Agatha stood back half watching the pictures and half watching Rio. The way her eyes lit up as she took in every image. There was something precious about her admiration. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As the slide show ended Rio made her way to the door “Anyway, we’ve gotta head out, we’re going out to dinner, but I’ll see ya around before long!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Make sure that you do! And Agatha, keep an eye on this one, she may be charming but trust me she’s trouble!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh I know it!” Agatha replied as they headed out the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>————————————————-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As Rio led them across town for dinner Agatha couldn’t help but let herself think, even just for a moment, what it might be like to have a child with Rio. She was brilliant and creative, adventurous and curious, loving and attentive. All qualities she wished she could have experienced in a parent growing up. But who knew if Rio even wanted kids? Was it too early to ask? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Before long they arrived at a small Italian restaurant. Rio held the door open for Agatha and they made their way inside the already crowded room. As soon as the door shut behind them they were greeted by a booming voice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well look who it is! Hey Gino! Guess who just walked through the door?!” He shouted to the back of the cramped space. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s not Mikey is it? That guy owes me 50 bucks!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No man, Vidal’s back!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A large man in a chef's coat and apron poked his head out of the tight doorway at the back of the house that led to the kitchen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No fuckin way!” He grinned, pulling his apron off and squeezing through the crowded dining room to the host stand where he crushed Rio in a hug. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Gino! Man, how you been?” She asked as he released her from his grip. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not too bad, not too bad! Business has been good. How’s things going out at your new job?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s been great, I finally found a place out there, settling in. I’ve actually brought someone with me for dinner.” She turned to introduce Agatha. “Gino, this is Agatha. Agatha, Gino. I used to run deliveries for him on the weekends.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled in amusement. Of course she worked with Gino too. “Nice to meet you.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I talked to Vicky earlier about putting me down for a table. You got one ready for me?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Let me see, I got a great spot that just opened up, I’ll get the boys to clear it off for you, gimmie 5 minutes.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thanks Gino!” She turned to Agatha who was chuckling to herself. “What’s so funny?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You!” She snickered, “You really are that charming aren’t you?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What can I say? I’m a delight and people love me.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I certainly do!” Agatha hummed in a sultry voice as she pulled Rio in for a kiss before they were quickly interrupted </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ahem, your table’s ready.” Choked out the blushing host. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jeeze, Tony! You really know how to ruin a moment!” Rio quipped with a smirk. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As they ate and talked Agatha couldn’t help her mind falling back to her earlier curiosity. Rio was magnanimous, a black hole of charisma that sucked in everyone she encountered. She seemed calm and assured of herself. She had a great, stable job that wasn’t taking her to the ends of the earth, risking her life. </span>
<em>
<span>She would have to see about that motorcycle when they decided to have kids.</span>
</em>
<span> She caught herself, just as her train of thought was rushing off the tracks. They had barely talked about their future, let alone children! Yet, she was surprised to find how easy it was to let that part of herself dream again. With Rio it felt like she was finding the pieces of herself she thought she lost with Wanda. Though it might look different than she planned, she could have a second chance at the family she had always hoped for. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ve been thinking…” She started as they waited for the check. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, my love?” Rio asked, leaning back in her chair, full. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“About what you said earlier this week.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mhmm” she hummed, “and what was that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“About our future, about what that could look like.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ah! I see.” Rio could feel her heart skip a beat as she thought of the conversation yet before them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“When you asked, my mind drew a blank. I hadn’t given much thought to a future beyond this.” She swallowed, feeling a trickle of anxiety creep into her chest. “Honestly I didn’t really think of my future at all until you asked. I had gotten so used to just taking each day as it came, not really caring about what came next. It didn’t really matter. Even after Wanda I had tried and hoped so hard for a life I didn’t think I was meant to live that I gave up even trying.” She let herself sit in the moment as she built up courage to continue. “And as soon as I stopped trying, you appeared.” She sighed a breathy laugh that Rio echoed. “And I don’t think I’ve felt this light in years!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio reached out and took her hand, bringing it up to her lips and pressing a kiss to the back of her fingers. She could feel her gut bubbling once again with anticipation, seeing Agatha’s vulnerability. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I guess what I’m trying to say is I’m starting to see that future with you. A long one I hope.” She cracked a smile. “How did you put it? A house, a couple of kids, and some pets?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Something like that.” Rio breathed shakily as she moved to take the last sips of her wine. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, I’m not one for picket fences, but were you serious about kids?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>At that Rio choked on her wine, sputtering it through her mouth and nose down the front of her shirt and coughing uncontrollably. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh my gosh, are you ok?” Agatha rushed to help clean up and handed her a glass of water. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I’m fine.” Rio croaked, “just went down the wrong pipe.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>In the midst of their chaos Gino stopped by with the check. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Geeze, Vidal, you still learning to drink or something!” He teased seeing the mess. “I just wanna let you know, this one’s on the house!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, Gino, you don’t have to do that!” Rio rasped. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Please! It’s my pleasure! So glad you stopped by to see us. It was nice meeting your lady friend here. Hope you come back by soon.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh you know it!” Rio laughed, lungs finally cleared of liquid as they stood and headed for the door. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The conversation lost, they caught an uber back to the house. The ride back to the house was silent and thick with the anxieties they were each holding. On top of that, Rio’s blunder caused the whole car to smell like wine and she had to sit the 30 minute journey back wet and sticky. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry about your shirt.” Agatha finally whispered as they walked into the entryway. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh! It’s not your fault! I just need to learn how to hold my wine!” Rio laughed timidly. “I’m going to hop in the shower though.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Give me your shirt first, I’ll soak it and try and get these stains out at least.” She sidled over to stand before Rio as her hands came up to gently pull the buttons open on her shirt. She sucked in her bottom lip as she let her gaze float up to meet Rio’s whose honey amber eyes glowed in the low light of the sconces aligning the walls. She continued down the shirt until Rio’s bare chest was staring back at her. She could feel a heat rise in her burning down to her core as she peeled the garment off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll meet you upstairs?” Rio breathed, beginning to blush at the exposure. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded then leaned in, pulling Rio’s lips into hers as her fingers tangled into her hair. Though hesitant at first, Rio melted into the touch, wrapping her hands around Agatha’s waist and pulling her in closer. Agatha smiled at the response, breaking the kiss. “You better go wash off, you’re very sticky!” She giggled as she pulled herself away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio turned reluctantly and headed up the stairs to the shower. Once under the water her mind was racing. </span>
<em>
<span>Did that really happen? Was she serious? How was she so oblvious? And it was right there! She could have asked her but she literally choked! </span>
</em>
<span>She felt defeated and overwhelmed by it all and at this point she needed help, she needed advice. She wasn’t ready to talk to Lilia, there would be too many questions she couldn’t answer and she was still upset with how she had handled everything. Then she remembered, she was seeing Yelena tomorrow. Between her, and Nat, and Hela maybe they could help her figure this out. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took her time treating Rio’s shirt. She kept running through everything she had said. </span>
<em>
<span>Why the fuck did she say that? Was it too soon? Had she upset Rio by asking? </span>
</em>
<span>She felt embarrassed that she had even brought it up. She tried to push the worries from her mind. Rio did love her, and in the end that’s all she really wanted. She didn’t need to push anything that, honestly, was a pipe dream to begin with. She was happy and grateful for all Rio had done for her. She didn’t need to rush things. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio exited the shower she was greeted by Agatha, half naked brushing her teeth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I was going to come join you but then the water turned off.” She mumbled with a mouth full of toothpaste. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I can jump back in if you’d prefer!” Rio offered shamelessly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha spit and looked back up at Rio through the mirror with a wicked smirk, “No that’s alright!” She spun around eyeing Rio, “I wasn’t really planning on showering anyway.” she hummed suggestively, raising an eyebrow. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh!” Rio laughed nervously</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stood from where she was leaning on the counter to walk over to Rio, grabbing her hand and leading her back into the bedroom. There she pushed Rio back to sit against the bed and came up to straddle her as her hands moved intently undoing the towel around her. Agatha leaned down, pressing her lips against Rio’s as her hair fell like a veil around them. Once the towel was shed Agatha leaned forward, pressing Rio down into the mattress as she peppered kisses down her neck and onto her chest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio breathed heavily as the tornado of Agatha’s love was thrust upon her. Her mind was quickly losing the battle to the sensations she was currently feeling. The rising swell of desire pooled in her core as Agatha nipped and kissed further down her body. She reached down to lift Agatha’s face, to simmer the heat that was burning between them, but her sky blue eyes were awash, blown wide with passion. They gazed up at her devilishly as her hands came up and pinned Rio’s wrists to the bed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha…I…”Rio stammered as Agatha leaned forward, capturing her lips once again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Come on!” Agatha breathed onto her lips. She leaned down further brushing the shell of her ear. “Let me show you how good you’ve been.” She kissed softly, just beneath her earlobe then nipped at the soft piece of skin as her hands glided down Rio’s body. Rio let a shaky breath escape her lips.“So good for me” Agatha moaned as her lips kissed down Rio’s body again and she slid a leg between her thighs. Rio let out an involuntary moan at the pressure. She closed her eyes trying to search for any ounce of willpower. She needed to stop this before it got too much further. “Fuck…Agatha!” She managed to cry out just as Agatha’s hand began to wander further down. “WAIT!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stilled her movements and sat up, looking at Rio with a mixture of confusion and concern. “Did I? Is there something wrong?” She breathed nervously.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No!” Rio huffed, breathless. “You’re fine, I just…I think my period started while we were at the restaurant.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sat back on her heels, somewhat disappointed. “Oh!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Believe me, the last thing I want to do is stop whatever was about to happen, but it feels like someone is having a knife fight inside me right now. Maybe I could get a raincheck or something? When I’m not dying?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha shifted to move off of Rio. “Yeah for sure.” she replied, though the pang of the second rejection this evening was bitterly sharp. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you ok?” Rio asked gently, seeing Agatha withdraw.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, of course, why wouldn’t I be ok?” she replied abruptly as she threw on one of Rio’s t-shirts from the floor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Just making sure.” Rio said, not buying Agatha’s nonchalance. She grabbed her hand, pulling her back in as she wrapped her arms around Agatha’s thighs, resting her head on her stomach. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha reached down and pulled Rio’s face to look at her. “Can I get you anything? For the pain?” She offered through a half smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, “I’ll be yours forever if you could find me some advil?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha softened at the request. She knew that pain all too well and couldn’t help but feel sympathetic to it. She brushed a few hairs from Rio’s face and bent down to press a kiss to Rio’s forehead. “How could I deny you when you look at me with those eyes!” They were wide and sorrowful like a pleading puppy. “I’ll be right back.” She pulled herself away from Rio’s grasp, threw on her robe and headed to search for the medicine. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As soon as the door closed Rio flopped back onto the bed with a sigh of relief. It had been a convenient excuse that was, unfortunately, all too real. Her insides were betraying her as the anxiety and pressure of the past week had built up to the point they had to release themselves one way or another. She searched her bag for a comfortable pair of underwear and one of the few pads she happened to pack should she be stuck in this very situation. By the time she dressed and finished getting ready for bed Agatha had returned with the medicine and glass of water. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I tried to find you a heating pad or hot water bottle or something but I was lucky to even find the pills.” She shrugged apologetically. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“This should be enough. Thank you, Cariño.” She swallowed the pills and pressed a soft kiss to Agatha’s lips then pulled them both into bed. She wrapped each of her limbs tightly around Agatha, like an octopus’s tentacles, so that there was barely room for air between them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha snuggled into the embrace, tucking her head under Rio’s chin against her chest. As Rio’s fingers combed gently through her hair the drum of her heartbeat soothed her into a restful slumber. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>—————————————————</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>FRIDAY:</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio sat in her van in the parking lot of the storage facility waiting for Yelena. She had spent a rather silent morning with Agatha as they packed their items and cleaned the small space they were still using in preparation for the photographer to come. Agatha didn’t seem upset or angry, just quiet, and that concerned her more than anything else. She knew something was off, besides the obvious, but couldn’t coax Agatha to admit to anything. More than likely they just needed some time apart before dinner that evening. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was glad she would have a chance to at least chat with Yelena before then, if she would ever show up. She had a penchant for arriving late but was pushing it, even for her. Rio was about to call and make sure she was even awake before she saw Yelena's Subaru pull into the lot. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I thought we said 10!” She hollered as she exited the vehicle. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well I was already gonna be a few minutes late so I stopped and got coffee.” Yelena climbed out of her vehicle carrying two cups. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ve already had coffee and breakfast. It’s practically lunch.” Rio said as she took the cup. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If you don’t want it then give it back!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, it’s mine, you bought it for me! I’m just pointing out that your late streak has gotten worse.” Rio chuckled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey I’m here aren’t I?” She scoffed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, thanks, I really do appreciate the help. Man, I'm glad to see you!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good to see you too! So you wanna get started loading, or do you wanna talk about whatever is going on with this girlfriend of yours?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Dude, you are not fucking ready! We’re going to have to multitask because both are going to take all day and I’ll still need to shower before dinner.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh god! What have you gotten yourself into this time?” Yelena rolled her eyes as she followed Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It did indeed take the whole afternoon to unload the unit and figure out how to Tetris everything into Lilia’s van. The entire time Rio went through every sordid detail she knew up until this point. She told her about Lilia’s suspicions and the delusional plan she had carried out. She reviewed the chaotic nature of the week she and Agatha had somehow managed to survive. She expressed her overwhelming confusion and fear about Agatha being pregnant and somehow not knowing herself and the impossible position that put her in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And you’re sure she’s actually pregnant?” Yelena had asked for the fifth time that day as they leaned against the packed car. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Dude! Everything I know about her says that’s impossible but knowing the signs, it’s pretty undeniable at this point. I just don’t get how?! And how does she not know? HOW? What am I supposed to do with that?!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I have no clue!” Yelena chuckled “I’d hate to be you right now. How do you even get yourself into these situations?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I blame Lilia for most of this! That and I love too hard!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You do tend to go head over heels pretty easily. It’s not necessarily a bad thing, but is this really what you want?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smiled thinking of Agatha, “I do. Which is what makes it worse! I don’t want to fuck it up! I’m worried she’ll bolt if I’m the messenger.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You want me to ask at dinner tonight? I don’t care if she hates me!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No! Absolutely not! I need all of you on your best behavior! This week has been stressful enough!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Have you told Nat and Hela?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not yet, I’ve got to figure that out too.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We’ll think of something tonight.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“With Agatha there?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t stress, I’ll try to get there early and fill them in.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You…get there early?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Listen, you’ve got a pregnant girlfriend, clearly anything can happen.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha kept checking the time as the real estate agent prattled on about different conditions and all the potential this place had to be a quick sale. Rio should have been back by now, they still had to get ready for dinner with Rio’s friends. Something she couldn’t tell if she was more excited or nervous for. She was also reaching that point of hunger where if she didn’t eat soon she’d murder the next person that breathed wrong. At that moment she heard the front door open and Rio soon found her in the kitchen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mi amor! I'm so sorry I’m late!” She rushed to Agatha, planting a kiss on her cheek. “I had a lot more shit stuffed into that box than I remembered. Hey, I’m Rio” she turned to the agent who hadn’t entirely stopped talking. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey, Shirley!” Agatha interrupted “Thank you so much for your help! I know this place is in good hands. If you don’t mind, we have dinner plans so I’ll catch up with you when I’m back in Westview.” Agatha shuffled the woman out the door. They both rushed upstairs as Rio took her time in the shower, Agatha quickly got ready. She waited nearly an hour, as her hunger grew, for Rio to emerge from the bedroom, ready. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Finally! I thought I was going to have to leave without you!” She complained</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sorry, my love! Good things take time.” Rio shrugged</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You take any more time and we’re going to be late!” Agatha grabbed Rio’s hand and dragged her out to the waiting uber.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As they entered the restaurant Rio could see Hela and Nat at a booth in the far corner. Of course, Yelena was running late, </span>
<em>
<span>so much for getting there early</span>
</em>
<span>. The nervous pit in her stomach returned as she led Agatha over to her friends. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio! Oh my god! It’s been so long! So good to see you again!” Nat wrapped her into a tight hug. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nice seeing you, Vidal! Hope things are going well out in Westview.” Hela stated a little more reservedly than Nat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m hanging in there, finally getting settled. I want you both to meet my girlfriend, Agatha. Agatha, this is Hela and Nat. You’ll meet Yelena whenever she decides to show up.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh! Wow! So nice to meet you both! Sorry to say hi and run but I have to go to the restroom before I explode!” Agatha sat her stuff down and ran to the bathroom just as Yelena made her way over to the table. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What happened to getting here early?” Rio chided. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Listen, I’m on time, that’s early for me. Where’s your girlfriend?” Yelena asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She’ll be back, she had to go to the bathroom.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, the little squirt pushing on her bladder or something?” She laughed before noticing Nat and Hela’s confused looks. “Oh, did you not tell them yet?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, she literally just left!” Rio snapped</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can one of you fill us in? What’s going on, what chaos have you conjured now?” Nat asked half amused. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes and let out a deep sigh, “So, don’t say anything, but Agatha’s pregnant.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?” Nat gasped</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Excuse me?” Hela asked, eyebrows raised.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That woman is pregnant? How far along?” Nat asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t know. Honestly I don’t know any of the details.” Rio replied </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What do you mean?” Hela asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha doesn’t know she’s pregnant” Yelena giggled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Again, I ask, what do you mean? How do you know she’s pregnant and she doesn’t even know?”  Hela reiterated</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Listen I don’t have time to go over everything but I need your advice. I’ve been trying to figure out how to talk to her about it, but haven’t really found the right opportunity. Things have been hectic this week to say the least. How do you tell someone they’re pregnant? Help me!” Rio begged. “Also I told her none of us are drinking because we are supporting Nat in her recovery.” She added looking at Hela sipping from a rocks glass. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re lucky I’m at the end of this!” Hela said as she tossed back the last of her drink. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why am I the one with the drinking problem?” Nat whined. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It wasn’t intentional, I picked one of you at random. So, any thoughts?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Outside of just coming out and asking?” Hela confirmed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Obviously that’s why I’m asking. Every time I try to ask her I panic, or choke.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Could you get her to take a pregnancy test?” Yelena asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How do you suggest I go about that? Hey, I had this super cute date idea, let's both take a pregnancy test.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well not if you put it like that!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Who else knows about this? Besides us?” Hela asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Just Lilia.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Would you be comfortable having Lilia talk to her?” Nat asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Absolutely not! She’s part of the reason I’m in this mess to begin with!” Rio scoffed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Understandable, however, why do </span>
<em>
<span>you </span>
</em>
<span>have to be the one to tell her?” Nat questioned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I offered but she shot me down!” Yelena chuckled</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, because it would be worse coming from you. But, you do have a point, maybe I could ask Jen?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ask Jen about what?” Rio hadn’t seen Agatha before she reappeared behind her. She did her best to hide her look of panic as she thought of something to say. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“My love! I didn’t see you come back! I was… telling them about our karaoke night with your friends. Jen and I had fun, I was thinking of asking her if she wanted to hang out sometime.” She wasn’t proud of the lie but she hoped it worked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Really?” She huffed, “You and Jen? I would have figured you’d hit up Ralph for happy hour at Chili’s.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, Ralph, he’d be fun to hang out with too!” She eyed notably at her trio of friends. Luckily Agatha didn’t dwell on it and turned her attention to the new person at the table. “Agatha, nice to meet you!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yelena, nice to meet you too, Rio’s told us </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> much about you!” She said, giving the rest of the table a knowing look. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I wish I could say the same but Rio hasn’t been as forthcoming!” She nudged Rio</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You ashamed of us Vidal?” Hela joked </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, we’ve just been preoccupied! Yelena and I went to med school together, I know nat from my residency, and Hela is the mentor I told you about. They are the only reason I’ve made it to where I am today!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re being modest! You were an outstanding student! Top of the class really!” Yelena praised. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The best mentee I’ve ever had! She was born to be a surgeon. The only thing I've seen her struggle with is difficult conversations.” She eyed Rio pointedly. “She tends to defer that responsibility.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio was strangling Hela with her eyes as Hela grinned back slyly. “Yes, that’s something I’m still working on. If it was easy they wouldn’t call them difficult conversations now would they?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Really? That surprises me! You’re so gregarious, my dear!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, that’s not the problem though.” Rio admitted </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio tends to let her emotions get the best of her and then she’ll clam up.” Yelena explained, smirking at Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“To be fair, most of the time it’s life or death. It’s to be expected, just something you have to train yourself to do, like the rest.” Hela reasoned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As their food arrived they sat and got to know each other better. They each poked and prodded at Rio, sharing wild encounters from school and horror stories from their days in residency. They studied Agatha, asking her every question under the sun trying to get as much context as they could for Rio’s current situation. Just as they were wrapping up Agatha excused herself to head to the restroom again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright I’m taking bets, who's got 4 months?” Yelena proclaimed as soon as Agatha was out of earshot. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No.” Rio grumbled</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No way! I’d say 3 months tops! She’s so tiny!” Nat replied </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Seriously guys?!” Rio whined</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I bet she’s further along than we think. If I were you I’d talk to Jen sooner rather than later.” Hela advised</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Believe me! It’s the first thing on my list now when we get back tomorrow. Honestly I should rope in Ralph too, he seems like he would be a good buffer. Things between Jen and Agatha can get tense easily.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You have to keep us updated! Let us know how the intervention goes!” Nat beamed excitedly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s not an intervention! It’s just all of her friends coming together to tell her she’s pregnant. Fuck me!” </span>

<span>When Rio headed back into work on Sunday afternoon her first thought was to find Jen. She’d had another sleepless night after getting back late the day before and dropping Agatha off at home. It was the first night they had spent apart since she had found out about the pregnancy and the cacophony of thoughts were louder than ever. She did feel some relief at having decided to involve Agatha’s friends, they should know best how to help ease her through this, and she wouldn’t have to do it alone. Her anxiety lay more in the sense of urgency. Each day that passed with Agatha not knowing put both her and the baby at greater and greater risk and added pressure to the already stressful conversation ahead. So, as soon as she dropped her stuff off in her office she headed down to talk with Monica, the head nurse in labor and delivery. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Monica was in every sense a boomer. A short plump woman with a severe, bobbed, bleach blonde haircut that just screamed </span>
<em>
<span>I’m gonna need a manager. </span>
</em>
<span>She was nosey and controlling and lorded her ounce of power over all those she deemed beneath her. Though, in the presence of doctors, she would do her best to put on the most humble demeanor she could muster. As Rio sauntered up to the nurses station she was greeted with a saccharinely sweet,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Dr. Vidal! To what do I owe the pleasure of  this unexpected visit?” She was doing a poor job of masking her annoyance at Rio’s disturbance. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jennifer Kale!” Rio barked back at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Excuse me?” She asked perplexed </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is Jennifer Kale working? If not, when is she working next?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh let me see…” she clicked around on the computer at a glacial pace, muttering to herself through each page she pulled up. “Jennifer, Jennifer… you know, it’s not often we see you lot down here if it’s not an emergency. Let alone for one of the nurses specifically.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Right…” Rio didn’t engage, instead she drummed her fingers anxiously on the counter as she waited for the answer she was searching for. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Must be something pretty important for you to make your way all the way down here from your office on the 5th floor.” Monica was nosing for gossip and using the info Rio needed to extort it from her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Listen, Monica is it? Are you going to tell me when Jen is in or am I going to have to tell the chief nursing officer about the hour nap you take every shift without clocking out?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Monica’s face was a mixture of rage and astonishment. “You wouldn’t!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Try me! Where’s Jen!?” She half shouted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You looking for me?” Jen asked as she sidled up to Rio at the nurses station. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey! Jen! Yes, actually I wanted to ask you something…” she said as she glared and stuck her tongue out at Monica and led Jen into an empty room. She closed the door behind them as she saw Monica peeking over the desk intrigued. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey! What’s up? When did you guys get back?” Jen asked as Rio pulled her further away from the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Late last night.” She said abruptly. “Hey, I wanted to see if you’d like to go to happy hour or something? My treat!” It came out more panicked than she intended. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah…” Jen laughed, confused by the energy of the conversation. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Great, when are you free?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Um…I’m off Thursday and Friday, but I’d have to check with Alice and see if we have any plans.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, Thursday’s perfect! Actually yeah, invite Alice too. Oh and Ralph, it’d be great to have all of you there, really. Just…don’t mention anything to Agatha.” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen rolled her eyes and groaned, “Why? What’d she do now?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Honestly, not sure, hoping you can help me figure that out!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Listen, Agatha and I have been friends for a long time but that doesn’t mean I understand why she does the things that she does.” Jen sighed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“At this point I’m less concerned with the why and more with the how and how long.” Rio babbled</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And you can’t ask Agatha?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m hoping to get an outsider's perspective.” Rio reasoned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I see why you two get along, neither one of you makes any damn sense. Fine, Thursday.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes! Thank you!” She hugged Jen before searching her pockets for a card. “Here’s my number, text me! We’ll figure out a time - remember don’t say anything to Agatha! Please!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—------------------------------------------------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was nearly 2:00 by the time Agatha rolled out of bed on Sunday. She had struggled to settle down after Rio had dropped her off and didn’t fall asleep until nearly three in the morning. Her mind was still consumed by the events of the previous week, particularly their last nights. Rio had seemed distant and antsy the whole last day, hardly speaking to her. She swirled about their conversation at dinner, </span>
<em>
<span>I shouldn’t have brought it up, why did I bring up kids, clearly it was just a joke. </span>
</em>
<span>And then there was the way she caught Rio staring at her, like she might explode at any minute. If the whole week had been a trial for their relationship she felt like she had failed. Like somehow Rio was afraid of her, maybe she came on too strong? It made her sick. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She threw on a pair of sweatpants and her robe and crept down the hallway to the kitchen in search of something to eat. As she rounded the corner she nearly smacked into Ralph who was raiding her fridge. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck! Ralph! Don’t do that!” She shouted as her heart slowed back to a normal pace. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t do what? I was just getting some cheese.” He replied as he closed the door. “Shit! Girl, you are lookin…rough. What happened, bad week?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You could say that. I also slept like shit.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s 2:00, you’ve been sleeping all day.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Doesn’t mean I slept well.” She said as she dug around in her half empty pantry. “You certainly made yourself at home here didn’t you? Really, you ate all my wheat thins?” She didn’t know whether to cry or kill him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, they’re on the coffee table with the rest of my charcuterie. Come join me, I want all the tea about your trip with </span>
<em>
<span>Rio.</span>
</em>
<span>” She let him lead her to the couch where she collapsed onto the pillows and stuffed a grape into her mouth. “Was it really that bad?” He asked, seeing her forlorn look.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well yes and no. I mean Rio was great! She was super helpful, barely let me lift a finger. She cooked half the time. I’d probably still be sorting through garbage if she hadn’t come and helped.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But…?” He asked, seeing the inevitable coming.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I think…I fucked it up!” She hadn’t expected it but tears began to stream down her face. “I don’t know, she was really standoffish the last couple of days. The whole ride back was practically silent, she just kept looking over at me like I was gonna die or something.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did something happen?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well…” she sniffled then chuckled to herself, “She had planned this whole day on Thursday, it was so sweet. We went to the museum, a bookshop, I met a few people that she used to work with. This one guy she knew was showing us pictures of his grandson…” she started to sob “and he was so cute, just this little tiny guy…and…I don’t know.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t know what?” Ralph asked as he helped himself to cheese and crackers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I saw the way Rio looked at him, and it made me think.” she was hiccuping through the sobs now.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, honey!” Ralph cooed as he rubbed her leg comfortingly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I thought I was done with the whole kid thing but…I’m not!” she breathed in shakily “I saw her looking at that baby and thought, maybe it could still be possible. One way or another.” She managed to slow her sobbing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did you ask her about it?” He asked, cautiously. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She swallowed back the tears threatening to fall again. “I may have brought it up at dinner that night.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m afraid to ask, but how did that go?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You should have seen the look on her face! She looked like I told her I’d killed her whole family, and then choked on the wine she was drinking.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, maybe not the reaction you were going for, but it probably just caught her off guard.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Then the whole ride back to the house was awkward and silent. I tried to make it up to her later but that didn’t go well either.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What? Did you break her nose trying to ride her face or something?” He joked, attempting to break the tension. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can’t. you. be. serious. for one. second?!” She grunted as she smacked him repeatedly on the arm. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ok…ok, I’m sorry. What happened?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nothing! Nothing happened!” She shouted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What do you mean?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Her period started so she asked for a rain check.” She whined</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh…gross!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh! Grow up!” She shoved him as she rose from the couch and headed into the kitchen to make herself a cup of coffee. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Just as she turned to put away the creamer Ralph noticed the scratch on her cheek. “Um…what the fuck happened to your face?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes as she returned to the couch, mug in hand. “Oh fuck! I completely forgot about that!” She laughed to herself. To think, she had been so wrapped up in Rio she had completely forgotten about Evanora. “You are not going to believe who showed up at the estate sale!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Who?!” Ralph asked, half worried, half giddy with anticipation. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“My </span>
<em>
<span>fucking</span>
</em>
<span> mother!” Agatha groaned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No!” Gasped Ralph “Tell me everything!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I walk downstairs and she’s standing there talking to Rio. Who knows what she said to her. Of course we get into it and I don’t know, I think she forgot there were other people around, and she smacked me. I didn’t really see what happened after that but apparently Rio shoved her and threw her out of the house.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oooo knight in shining armor!” Ralph teased. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha glared at him and rolled her eyes. “Anyway, that’s what this is from. ” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So, have you heard from her?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Who? My mother?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, bitch! Have you talked to Rio? Since you got back.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I just woke up. I don’t even know where my phone is.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How do you live like this? Go check and see if she texted you before you spiral too much further into this pit of self loathing.” He urged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She rolled off the couch in search of her phone, eventually finding it at the bottom of her duffle bag. She could feel her chest tighten with anxiety as she turned it over to check for messages. The glowing screen met her with some instagram notifications, a few emails from work, but nothing from Rio. Her breath stilled in her chest and she could feel a cold lump forming in her throat. Trying not to panic she headed back to Ralph in the living room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nothing!” She sighed as she tossed her phone at him. “See! I told you! I fucked it up.” She flopped next to him on the couch, burying her face in her hands. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Ralph swung his arm around her, pulling her onto his shoulder. “Listen, it’s been less than 24 hours. Give her a chance to miss you a bit at least.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But I already miss her!” She pouted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Then tell her!” He dangled her phone in her face. “Instead of crying about it! Because, I love you, but this is pathetic! Even for you!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She sat up gradually, taking the phone from him. She stared at the last messages, Rio letting her know she was headed to Boston, and contemplated what to say. In the end she landed on,</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Hey hon! Hope you made it to work alright. Already miss you!  💜 </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She pressed send and threw her phone on the other side of the couch. She laid back, stretching her legs into Ralph’s lap as Scratchy jumped up onto her stomach and began kneading and purring loudly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How was he for you while I was gone?” She asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, he was pissed! He kept walking around the house screaming. I’d give him food and treats and he’d calm down for a bit but would start screaming again eventually. He only settled down when I threw your dirty laundry on the chair over there.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I was wondering where that went. I thought you might have tried to wash it!” She chuckled. “Damn, how many treats did you give him? He’s so much heavier!” She groaned as he finally settled in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Listen, I was trying anything to get him to shut up. He’s so needy! I wonder where he gets that from?” He huffed </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As Scratchy sat there purring she could feel the odd spasm return at her side. She pushed him off of her lap to sit up as she pressed her fingers to the spot hoping it would stop soon. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why are you making that face?” Ralph asked, seeing her nose and eyebrows scrunched in discomfort. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh, my stomach has been insane lately! I keep getting this weird spasm? Like bubbles or something, but sometimes it goes away if I…” she let out a loud belch, “burp.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nice!” He commented, a little grossed out. “Did you ever go see a doctor like Jen told you to?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She glared at him, “What do you think?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If you’re still having issues you should go see a doctor. It’s probably only going to get worse until you do.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She burped again, “Fine, I’ll have Sharon call tomorrow and make me an appointment.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—--------------------------------------------------------</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>After making plans with Jen for Thursday, Rio buried herself in the mountain of work that she had come back to in an attempt to distract herself. The piles of paperwork, staff meetings, and three consultations had kept her busy, but her mind kept running over and over the task ahead. By the time she made it out of the building, just after midnight, she was nearly delirious with exhaustion. In her sleepy haze she sat in her car and finally checked her phone. Along with a series of missed calls from Lilia, she saw the lone message from Agatha. In her preoccupation to solidify her plans she hadn’t even thought to check in with Agatha herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She thought of all the catching up still yet to do from their week away. She was aware of her own trepidation and nerves around seeing Agatha before she had a chance to talk with the others. She needed time to think and prepare. Not that she didn’t want to see Agatha, she just needed to conserve her energy wisely before the inevitable fallout of what was yet to come.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Sorry to get back so late, my love, I’ve been swamped. It’s gonna be a busy week. Not sure when I’ll get to see you, I’ll let you know.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She figured that would at least buy her some time until Thursday. She hurriedly sent the message and headed home before she could fall asleep at the wheel. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—------------------------------------------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha awoke the next morning to the sound of her alarm blaring from her phone on the nightstand. She reached over, still half asleep, as she brought the screen to her face to turn it off. With the alarm silenced, her screen flashed back to a text notification she couldn’t quite see without her glasses. She fumbled around in her nightstand drawer until she found her spare pair and blinked her eyes into focus. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio Vidal - message</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A sudden rush of fear and excitement bolted her awake. She quickly unlocked her phone and tapped on the message. As she scanned it she felt her heart drop in disappointment. </span>
<em>
<span>Not sure when I’ll get to see you. </span>
</em>
<span>It sat heavy in her stomach like a bag of sand. She figured after their week away Rio would be busy, sure, but before they had still been able to make time for each other. She was left with the same feeling of unease she had when Rio dropped her off, and wasn’t sure how to respond, so she pushed herself to get up and moving, determined to brush it off. As she readied herself for work she struggled to find an outfit that fit. All of her pants were snug and her chest was busting out of half of her tops. After changing several times, she ended up throwing on a loose fitting dress under her long navy coat before heading out the door late for work. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>When she entered the administrative part of the building she was greeted brightly by Sharon, “Welcome back dear! Don’t you look radiant today!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The only thing I’m radiating is the desire to sit down and be left alone. I have too much to catch up on.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“About that dear, Herb is waiting in your office, you have a meeting with the board at 9:30.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned and rolled her eyes as she headed down the hallway to her office. “Of course I do. Anything else I should know?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sharon grinned apologetically “While you were out they scheduled a seminar with Mr. Kaplan for Thursday evening and on Saturday they want to do an afternoon dress rehearsal of his newly commissioned work for select donors.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And none of this could have waited until I got back to schedule or plan?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“They want to capitalize on his availability since he’ll be leaving for Prague on Sunday.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Lovely!” she bit sarcastically,  “If you would, I’m going to need the strongest coffee you can bring me before I head into this meeting with the board.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You got it dear! Have you eaten anything?” Sharon asked sweetly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not yet, I haven’t had time.” Agatha replied bluntly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll grab you something to eat as well.” Sharon offered, knowing that might help take the edge off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Please, just a banana or something, I need to cut back on the pastries, half of my clothes aren’t fitting these days.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Will do, dear. Be back in a jiff!” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a deep breath before she burst through the door of her office startling Herb. “Herb! I hear we’re meeting with the board this morning?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, Agatha! Glad you made it in! I was worried you might have gotten held up in Boston. How did everything go with the house?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fine. Who called for the meeting this morning?” She wasn’t going to delve into her personal details, especially with this unexpected inconvenience.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It was a joint decision. I, along with several of the members, wanted to go over plans for the rest of this year in preparation for our upcoming summer season. Due, much in part, to your hard work with the fundraiser earlier this year, we may have the opportunity to invite some more artists into the fold. If so, it could give us the opportunity to attract some new donors, </span>
<em>
<span>if</span>
</em>
<span> we can determine the right people and programming and we’d like your input on that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And this </span>
<em>
<span>needed </span>
</em>
<span>to happen first thing this morning?” She growled, clearly annoyed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That is due to the board’s availability, unfortunately.” Her explained. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed and moved to put her stuff down just as Sharon returned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alrighty, dear! I have an iced latte with an extra shot, a banana and a yogurt.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Excellent! Thank you Mrs. Hart” Agatha said dismissively. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sharon, Dear.” Sharon corrected for the umpteenth time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Right. Herb, let’s get this over with.”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She stormed out of her office with Herb in tow down to the board room. As they neared the glass door at the end of the hallway she could see they were the last to arrive. She swung the door wide, making her presence known, and found her seat between Dr. Jones and Freddy, head of marketing. She sat back and tucked in to her breakfast, finishing her coffee quickly, as Herb dove into the topic at hand. They prattled and bickered, talking in circles about potential programs and what their needs were in attracting new audiences and donors. She was only half listening as her thoughts ping-ponged between all the work she still had to catch up on and Rio’s message. </span>
<em>
<span>What should she say? </span>
</em>
<span>It hadn’t left much room for response. </span>
<em>
<span>Did Rio not want to see her? Was she avoiding her after everything, or was she really that busy? Was she just overthinking everything after how awkward the ride back had been? </span>
</em>
<span>She couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something brewing between them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Harkness? You with us?” Hearing Herb’s voice call out to her she scanned the room, seeing all eyes on her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I heard you!” She snapped. “What do you want me to say Herb? It’s the same discussion we have every year. You keep going back to the same tired works expecting to draw in new people. Without offering them anything different it’s going to be the same tired, old, crowd.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Then what are you suggesting?” Spat Martha, the CFO and longest running member of the board. Her wrinkled old face puckered in frustration and condescension at the very thought of change. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If you want to attract donors that aren’t going to die in the next ten years you can’t expect them to sit and listen to music. They don’t have the attention spans for that. They need to experience the music.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Exactly what I’ve been saying!” shouted Freddy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And you know how much I hate to agree with Freddy.” she added. “Other cities have seen success with fusion concerts. I also think Freddy’s idea about the classical rave has legs.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thank you!” Freddy sighed as he patted her shoulder then rested his hand there. “Finally someone is making sense!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha brushed him off with a look of disgust and annoyance. “Whatever we end up with should be targeted at people under 60 as they are the intended audience.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Martha retorted at the age comment, sparking another lively back and forth between her, Herb and Freddy. As Agatha sat back, letting them continue to swirl, she felt the odd spasm return once again. This time it was a bit higher, up near her ribs. She shifted, hoping it would release whatever pocket of air was trapped, and waited for it to subside. Through another hour of pointless discussion, her mind still swirling about Rio, the spasm stopped and started, sometimes lower, sometimes higher, adding another layer of frustration to an already enormous waste of her time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As the meeting wrapped she quickly gathered her things and made a b-line for her office, catching Sharon at her desk along the way.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey! I’m going to need you to clear my schedule for the rest of today. If I have to deal with one other person after that disaster my head might explode!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Of course, dear. Are you alright?” She asked, seeing Agatha’s look of discomfort as she kneaded out another spasm. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ve got a headache and I keep getting this spasm that’s driving me crazy. Oh, which reminds me, can you call my doctor’s office and make an appointment for as soon as possible?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Clearly Ralph was right, ignoring it wasn’t going to make the problem go away and it had already gotten worse. It was time she got it checked out. She swiftly entered her office, closing the door with a slam behind her, and slunk into her chair heavy with the weight of all that had already happened that day, and got started on her mountain of work. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>About thirty minutes later Sharon came by with lunch and some documents for her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Here dear, this should help you feel a bit better. Also, I called and made that appointment for you. The doctor is out for the next few weeks so the earliest I could book is a month out.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p><span>She sighed as she took the bag of food. “Thank you, that’ll have to do.” She waved Sharon out dismissively as she returned to her ever growing list of tasks, catching up on emails and solidifying plans for the newly scheduled seminar she now had to organize for Thursday. All of which took longer than it should have as she kept debating on how to respond to Rio. She’d pick up her phone and stare at it for a while as she thought of what to say only to quickly put it right back down, unable to string together the right words. </span><em><span>Was she too in her head about this?</span></em> <em><span>Should she ask if anything is wrong or relax about the whole thing?</span></em><span> By the time she left work she still had not replied and decided she would talk it over with Ralph when she got home. </span></p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I just can’t tell if I’m overreacting.” She groaned as she slipped her shoes off, throwing them just beside the door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, you’re overreacting!” He laughed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You can’t possibly know that, I haven’t even shown you the message!” she huffed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I </span>
<em>
<span>know</span>
</em>
<span> you, you’re definitely overreacting.” He said as she handed him her phone to read the message. “So, I wouldn’t say it’s warm and fuzzy, but she also sent it at like 1:00 in the morning. I’m sure she was just tired after a long shift.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But what’s the, </span>
<em>
<span>not sure when I’ll get to see you</span>
</em>
<span>? Does she even want to see me?” She could feel her chest tighten at that thought. The idea of losing the only person she had let herself open up to, the only person who had let her see she still had love to give, was unfathomable. “What if she never wants to see me again?” Tears pricked at the corner of her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Ralph, seeing the storm brewing, put the phone down and walked over, wrapping her in a hug. “Hey, I’m going to need you to take a breath. You’re kind of at a ten right now.” She took a shuddering breath against his chest. “Good, now look at me.” He sandwiched her face between his hands. “She’s just busy, It’s going to be fine. Give her some space. Just text her to check in and leave it at that. Unless she says something is wrong then you can’t assume anything is wrong.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, taking another shaky breath as she blinked away the wetness in her eyes. “You’re right. You’re right. It’s fine, everything is fine. What should I say?” She asked as she picked up her phone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wow this is painful!” He rubbed his eyes in frustration. “Just ask her how her day was. Tell her how yours was. Hell, see if she wants to hang out this weekend. The basics Agatha!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She typed out a quick message:</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Hey! Thinking about you! Sounds like you came back to as much chaos as I did. Any chance you’d have a break in the mayhem to join me for a seminar on Thursday afternoon? 5:00?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She had Ralph read over it then she pressed send. Her body tingled with doubt and anticipation as she stared at the screen, secretly hoping for an instant reply. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Ralph grabbed her phone and set it on the counter. “Now, you’re gonna go change, come back and drink this chardonnay with me, and we’re gonna rewatch Real HouseWives of Salt Lake until we fall asleep.” She sighed with a mixture of exhaustion and relief as Ralph nudged her down the hallway.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—--------------------------------------------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio hadn’t had a moment’s rest since she stepped into the hospital late Monday afternoon. She had slept practically until she had to leave, finally finding some relief after having gotten the agreement from Jen to meet on Thursday. She didn’t have a chance to check her phone until nearly midnight when she grabbed a bite to eat. Her heart swelled as she saw the notification from Agatha. She missed her dearly but the pile of work she had to get through before Thursday was practically drowning her. She hurried to read it while nerves fluttered in her chest. As soon as her eyes scanned the word Thursday her stomach was in her throat. No, she couldn’t attend the seminar, she couldn’t exactly say why either. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Sorry, my love, but the mayhem rests for no one, not even me! Unfortunately, I won’t be able to join you at the seminar. Perhaps we can catch up afterward though?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As she sent the message her heart skipped a beat. </span>
<em>
<span>Afterward</span>
</em>
<span>. Afterward, she would have no excuse. She would have to talk to Agatha. She couldn’t let it simmer any further. Might as well get it all over with in one foul swoop. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With a renewed feeling of anxiety about the whole thing she reached out to Jen, confirming all was in place with the others. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Hey Jen! We still good for Thursday, 5:00? </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As soon as she set her phone down it buzzed in reply. She snatched it back up, hoping for it to be Agatha, but found Jen’s quick reply instead.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Hey Rio! Yeah Alice and I are down. I haven’t checked with Ralph yet. I’ll ask him tomorrow when I see him.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio could feel a lump in her throat as she waited for the last piece of the plan to click into place. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Sounds good - just make sure he knows - don’t tell Agatha!</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Yes, I got it! Don’t tell Agatha! </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Three days still to go and she was ready for the whole thing to be over. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—--------------------------------------------------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha had had a fitful night’s sleep. Between her fears about Rio and the three glasses of wine she had, her mind was a vortex she struggled to tame. As she groggily turned off her alarm she could feel the dull throbbing of a headache from the wine along with the return of the spasms. She was surprised to find, as she sat up, a wave of nausea crashing over her. She stumbled out of bed and rushed to the bathroom only to barely make it to the toilet. After she flushed the contents of her stomach down the drain she heard a knock on her bedroom door. She hurried to clean herself up and called for Ralph to enter.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey, I heard you up, everything ok?” He asked, seeing her stumble out of the bathroom a bit disheveled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No! I knew I shouldn’t have had that third glass last night. It didn’t stay with me this morning. What are you doing up?” She looked at him in confusion, Ralph rarely rose before noon.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m meeting Jen at the gym before her shift.” He explained</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The gym? Who are you trying to impress?” She spat back with a laugh</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Listen, I’ve got to get my shit together before my next cruise contract. I can’t afford to replace my entire wardrobe.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha narrowed her eyes at him, not entirely buying that excuse, and moved to double check the time on her phone. She caught a glimpse of Rio’s message and she immediately felt the prick of disappointment. She had hoped Rio’s presence could save her from what was promising to be a dismal affair. And again, it was how she phrased it, </span>
<em>
<span>perhaps we could catch up. </span>
</em>
<span>Was she unsure? It felt very noncommittal. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>‘What is it?” Ralph asked, seeing her pause.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio texted.” She replied shortly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good, what did she say?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She can’t make it on Thursday.” She lowered the phone, pressing it into Ralph’s chest as she passed him to start getting dressed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That sucks! Did she say anything else?” He asked as he unlocked her phone and read through the message. Agatha ignored the question as she dug through her closet trying to find something that wasn’t a struggle to put on. “She asked if you wanted to get together afterward.” He called out to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes as she squeezed into a purple sweater. “She asked if I wanted to </span>
<em>
<span>catch up</span>
</em>
<span> after.” She groaned, throwing off the sweater to try again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And…?” Ralph asked, “Do you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Would I like to see her? Yes. Would I like to have dinner, or maybe grab a drink or something? Yes. Do I want to </span>
<em>
<span>catch up</span>
</em>
<span>? It feels like an afterthought, like I’m a childhood friend she hasn’t seen in a long time and I’m in town so we should </span>
<em>
<span>catch up</span>
</em>
<span>.” She grumbled as she stuck her head through an oversized dress shirt. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re reading into things again.” He scoffed, annoyed. “You’re mad because you like her and you’re worried she may not be as head over heels.” Agatha let out a frustrated grunt as she struggled to zip up another pair of pants. “Move, those pants don’t go anyway.” Ralph pushed past her to dig around in her closet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“At this point I don’t care what they look like, I just want them to zip!” she whined. “I am so sick of whatever is going on with my digestive system. I’m so bloated, that weird spasm keeps coming back, I have heartburn half the time.” Her eyes grew wide with concern as she gasped, “What if I have a tumor?!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did you make an appointment with your doctor like I suggested?” Ralph sassed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, my assistant set one up but it’s not for like a month.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ok well, you have something scheduled at least. Just try not to worry about it too much until then. As for Rio, you clearly want to see her just say so, who cares how she phrased it.” He said as he pulled out a flowy skirt with a stretchy waist and an oversized sweater. “Here!” He shoved the items at her as he headed toward the door. “You want me to make you a protein smoothie? It should help with the hangover.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes! And two ibuprofen!” She easily slid on the garments and went to check herself out in the mirror. She hated when Ralph was right. Though she wouldn’t have picked it out herself, the outfit was quite flattering and comfortable. She sighed, annoyed at that fact, and went to grab her phone off the bed to re-read Rio’s message. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Ok, </span>
<em>
<span>maybe</span>
</em>
<span> she was reading into things, but she couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off. Before they left Rio would text her throughout the day, she would stop by before her shift, she’d leave her voice messages when she’d gotten home late for Agatha to wake up to. And now, </span>
<em>
<span>not sure when I’ll see you…maybe we can catch up afterward.</span>
</em>
<span> It felt like she was being strung along. She loved Rio, and thought Rio loved her, but now she was growing frustrated at the seemingly half hearted responses. Perhaps it was time for Rio to get a taste of her own medicine. Without responding she threw her phone in her bag, determined to wait and see, would Rio reach out again? </span>
</p><p>
<br/>

</p><p>
<span>—--------------------------------------------------------</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>By the time Ralph entered the Planet Fitness he was already 20 minutes late to meet Jen. He put his stuff away in the locker rooms and went in search of her, finally finding her on the second level finishing up a run on the treadmill. She glared at him and hopped off as he approached her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Where the fuck have you been?” She growled at him as she moved to wipe down her machine. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Girl, do not get me started! Agatha’s been driving me absolutely nuts! If I wasn't starting a new contract in a month I’d be moving in with you. Tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know those aren’t the only two options, you can rent an Airbnb or something.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes but then I’d be spending money and you know I only use that for food, wigs, and trips.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen rolled her eyes as she led them to the weights. “What’s Agatha torturing you with now?” She asked as she started a set. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So you know how she can be dramatic and emotional, and that emotion is usually bitch.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, I remember!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well she’s figured out how to take it to a new level. On top of her regular charm she’s been whining and crying about Rio cuz I guess things were weird in Boston? I hate managing relationship drama and she’s been so needy! Really I think she’s just overthinking everything and blowing this way out of proportion.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Huh” Jen breathed with a look of confusion and curiosity. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Huh? What huh?” Ralph asked as he started his set. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, funny you mention Rio. She tracked me down at the hospital on Sunday and was being weird and cryptic. She wants to take us to Happy Hour on Thursday.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Chili’s?” Ralph perked up excitedly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m sure she’ll take us wherever.” Jen dismissed “but, she specifically said don’t tell Agatha. That means you too!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oof, I will do my best! You know I can’t hide shit from her. She's going to smell something’s off, she’s already on edge.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, do your best. Avoid her if you can.” Jen advised. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did she say what it was about?” Ralph asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, like I said, she was being cagey. Just said she wanted our outsider input on something.” She shrugged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh” Ralph grimaced “You don’t think she’s going to break up with her do you?!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck, I hope not! I don’t want to deal with that aftermath!” Jen exclaimed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re telling me! I’m the one living with her!” Ralph emphasized “</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Wait, if she was going to break up with Agatha why would she take us out in the first place?” Jen asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good point. Maybe she wants Agatha to move in with her?” Ralph guessed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha owns that house.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, but would you want to give up that sick apartment?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen shrugged in agreement, “Well whatever the fuck is going on it needs to resolve itself quickly. I don’t like being dragged into this bullshit. I do want some free margaritas though, so are you in?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“When?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thursday, 5:00.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can we go to Chili’s? I’ve been thinking about chicken crispers since karaoke.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, I’ll see if she’ll take us to Chili’s” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—————————————————</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Upon heading into another jam-packed day on Tuesday afternoon Rio was buzzing with anticipation. She hadn’t heard from Jen or Agatha and her anxiety as the day grew closer felt like it could crush her at any minute. Unfortunately she didn’t have time to resolve any of it as she was already running late for her first consultation. She hurried in, throwing her stuff down in her office and rushed to her meeting. Four consultations, two insurance approval calls, and a missed dinner later she finally made it back to her office to finalize her patient paperwork. As soon as she settled into her chair there was a knock at her office door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Come in!” She called</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey! How’s it going?”A rush of relief washed over her as Jen stepped into the room and she hopped up to greet her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jen! I’m so glad to see you! Did you get a chance to talk to Ralph, is he able to come?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah” she chuckled at Rio’s exuberance  “He said he’ll come if you’ll take us to Chili’s.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Done!” She felt a million times lighter at the news. “5:00 still works?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, we’ll meet you there! Anything else you can tell me about this super secret happy hour?” She asked, trying to sound casual though her curiosity was evident. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes widened at the question, “Well…I…um. I think it would be better if I just went over everything when we’re all together.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re not trying to break up with her are you?” Jen asked bluntly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head in shock, “What?! No!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen sighed with relief, “Oh, thank god!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio laughed in confusion, “Is that what you thought this was about?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, yeah! You’ve both been fucking weird since you got back. Ralph says Agatha’s a mess.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart dropped hearing that. “What do you mean?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I guess she’s stressed and thinks she fucked things up with you.” Jen explained. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s face drew white with panic, “No! Holy shit, no. I’m just…I’m worried about her, but this week’s been crazy, my sleep is all messed up. I’ve not really been myself. I just needed a little space before we talked.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, if you’re not breaking up with her I’d tell her that before she spirals any further.” Jen advised and she made her way to the door. “Sorry, but this is the crazy you signed up for.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Heh, you have no idea.” Rio huffed under her breath. “Thanks Jen! I’ll see you all Thursday!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio slumped against the door as she closed it behind Jen. </span>
<em>
<span>Fuck!</span>
</em>
<span> The last thing she wanted to do was upset Agatha.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>———————————————</span>
</p><p> </p><p><span>As Agatha made it home Tuesday night she was a ball of frustration and rage. On top of another chaotic day trying to coordinate the seminar on Thursday and plan for the impromptu recital on Saturday she still hadn’t heard from Rio. She was doing her best not to imagine the worst case scenario, but at this point she could only feel it as inevitable. </span><em><span>Had she even noticed Agatha hadn’t responded?</span></em> <em><span>Did she even care at this point? </span></em><span>She was angry, at herself, at Rio, at the whole situation. Why had she let herself believe, even for a second, that this could work? Clearly, she wasn’t meant to find love. She wasn’t meant to be loved. She wasn’t meant to have a family. She wished she could just let that piece of her die so she didn’t have to feel the pain of this rejection. </span></p><p> </p><p>
<span>She bust through her door and threw all her things beside it in a huff. She stormed into the kitchen and began preparing herself something to eat. Just as she was slinging around pots and pans, trying to find the one she was looking for, Ralph wandered into view, saw the angered chaos, and quickly tried to make an exit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Where are you going?” She snapped. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Ralph froze, clearly trapped. “I was coming to get something to eat, but it can wait. I see you’re…busy” he muttered tentatively. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What did you do with my cast iron pan?” She asked accusingly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s in the oven.” He explained calmly, hoping to dispel some of the tension as he went and grabbed it for her. “I was seasoning it for you.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a huff, “Oh, thanks.” Then quickly turned back to preparing her food. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rough day?” He asked, already anticipating the answer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No!” She shouted sarcastically “Everythings fine! See!” She gave him a cheesy grin before her face immediately fell. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright” he laughed nervously, “as long as you’re good!” He eased back once again trying to escape. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know, I am this close to telling Herb to shove this fucking seminar. Why do they feel the need to do these things?! Nobody wants to go, I have to work with </span>
<em>
<span>Freddy</span>
</em>
<span> to try and get butts in seats and I swear if he pats me on the back one more time I’m going to break his fucking arm.” She threw the vegetables she was cutting aggressively into a bowl. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Ralph let out an exasperated sigh as he settled onto the stool at the counter, he had lost his chance to leave, he was in for the long haul now. “Oh boy, that’s the worst.” He said less than enthusiastically. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Please tell me you’re free and can come to this stupid thing so I don’t have to go by myself!” She whined. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“When is it?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“This Thursday, 5:00.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Ralph let out a nervous cough. “I…uh…no, sorry I’m busy.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Seriously?!” She groaned. “What could you possibly be doing at 5 on a Thursday?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey! I have a life! I made plans.” he exclaimed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh really? What plans? And can I talk you out of them?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry but free chicken crispers and margaritas are involved so it’s going to be a hard no!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can’t I just take you to Chili’s afterward instead?” she begged, pouting her lip. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Aren’t you seeing Rio after?” He asked slyly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha glared at him and turned back to the stove, “I don’t want to talk about her.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, come on, you’re not still pissy about what she texted you!” He groaned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I </span>
<em>
<span>don’t </span>
</em>
<span>want to talk about it!” she emphasized</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh! You are so dramatic! Either tell her how you’re feeling or shut the fuck up about it!” He said as he got up, grabbed a box of cereal and headed to his room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stood in the kitchen stewing as she finished cooking her dinner. She was frustrated with work, devastated by Rio, and now enraged at Ralph. She wanted to eat her dinner as quickly as possible, take a shower, and go to bed. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The next morning she awoke with her alarm, still feeling the lingering heat of anger from the night before along with the ever familiar presence of heartburn. She groaned at the ache as she rolled over reaching for her phone. As soon as she recovered from the blinding glow of the screen she caught sight of a voice notification from Rio. She scrambled to throw her glasses on and sat up quickly scrolling to the message. Her thumb hovered over the message, unsure of what to expect. Then she closed her eyes and pressed play. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s voice, tired and gravely, echoed through her speakers, “Hey, Cariño! Sorry, I know it’s late. This week has been…hectic, to say the least. I’ve been thinking about you, hope you’re doing alright. I’m sorry I can’t make it to your seminar but let me know if you’re up to meet afterward. There’s…uh…something I’m hoping to talk to you about, so…let me know. I love you. Te veo.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She sat in silence once the message finished. Her stomach turned as the words played over and over in her head. </span>
<em>
<span>Something I want to talk to you about. </span>
</em>
<span>What the hell did that mean? If she had been uneasy before it now felt like her world had spun upside down. She could feel the bile in her stomach working its way up again. She threw her phone on the bed and ran to the bathroom, only to repeat the spewing of the day before. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Now empty, she sank to lay on the bathroom floor as the words continued to echo in her mind. </span>
<em>
<span>What was she supposed to do with that? How was she supposed to take that as anything other than ominous? How was she just supposed to go about her life until then? </span>
</em>
<span>She pulled herself from the floor, peeled off her tank top and underwear, and crawled into the shower. She turned the water on cold, hoping the shock would bring her some clarity. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Ten minutes later, cold, shivering, and half numb she emerged from the shower in a haze. She couldn’t think about it, she had to block it out, otherwise it would consume her. She just had to make it to Thursday, somehow. She shoved herself into a pantsuit, threw her half-damp hair into a loose bun and headed out the door to work.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—---------------------------------------------------</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Rio finished her morning run she sat down on the steps of her apartment building and checked her phone. 10:00 and nothing from Agatha. She had sent a hazy voice message to her on the way out of the hospital at one in the morning, hoping to reassure her, let her know she missed her and was looking forward to Thursday, but had yet to get a reply. With everything else now in place she needed to make sure her plans with Agatha were secured. She still had a few hours before she had to be in, and after hearing from Jen how distraught she was, thought it might be best to swallow her nerves and surprise her in person.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She ran upstairs and hopped in the shower and quickly got ready. By the time she was done it was nearing lunch so she decided to stop by their favorite sandwich shop and grab them both lunch. She swung by a local flower shop and picked her out a nice bouquet then headed into Music Hall. As she entered the building her stomach was awash with butterflies. Having not seen Agatha since dropping her off on Saturday she wasn’t sure what she was walking in to. She pushed open the doors to the administrative part of the building and headed down the hall to her office. As she approached the closed door she took a breath and raised her hand to knock. Just as she was about to make contact Sharon popped out from behind her desk nearby. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh! Sweetheart I wouldn’t do that if I were you!” she warned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio swung around, startled by the small woman’s presence. “Why? What’s going on, is everything ok?” she asked, concerned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ya know, today’s just one of those days where I wouldn’t bother her. She’s been in a mood all morning. Now she’s in her second meeting with Freddy and he’s already running over by 20 minutes. Something tells me she wouldn’t receive it very well right now.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, ok.” Rio muttered in disappointment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’d be happy to give her the flowers and whatever else you brought when she gets out. Just trust me, you don’t want to run into her today if you don’t have to! A-ha-ha-ha” Sharon laughed anxiously.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Any chance you have some paper, I could write her a note?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sure thing!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—------------------------------------------------------</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced at the clock again, 1:20. This meeting was supposed to have finished nearly an hour ago but Freddy couldn’t seem to keep his mouth shut. They had prepped for Thursday and he insisted they do a runthrough with Mr. Kaplan. They solidified plans for Saturday, ensuring the guest list was up to date and he demanded they review the seating arrangements. Now he was babbling on and on about the same market strategies and her patience was running thin. More funding, they always needed more funding, and that was her responsibility, but somehow Freddy always seemed to make it his priority. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know we are already ahead of our goal for this year, but if we could get 7% more from our donors before the spring season we would have the funding needed to hire a social media team.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What, is the intern you’re sleeping with not cutting it?” Agatha scoffed, completely over his groveling. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>That</span>
</em>
<span> was completely uncalled for.” He spat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Was it wrong?” She looked him over, eyebrows raised, daring him to deny it. “That’s what I thought. I don’t know what you expect from me. We have to have something to offer these people and Martha refuses to fund any of your suggestions. You’re going to need to take this sales pitch over to her and Herb if you want anything to move forward.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But would you support me in going to Martha?” He begged</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m not going to hold your hand! You’re a big boy, go do it yourself. I have enough on my plate, and frankly, I’m done having this conversation.” She stood from her desk and began ushering him out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But will you talk to them too? Let them know how close we are and the impact it could have? I really think your opinion could sway them!” He squeezed in just as she started to close the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll think about it.” With that she slammed the door in his face and turned to collapse onto her office couch. Not two seconds later there was a knock at her door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?!” She shouted as the door creaked open. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Just me dear, there’s lunch out here for you, if you’re hungry.” Sharon asked sweetly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What is it?” Agatha groaned, not sitting up to acknowledge her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“A turkey club from that place you like. Your friend brought it for you.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>At that her head popped up, “What?! What friend?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, she’s about your height, dark hair, she had on the cutest denim dress. I’ve seen her here once or twice before.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio?!” She gasped sitting bolt upright. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ope, I forgot to get her name! Oh but she left a note with the flowers.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Flowers?” Agatha stood to follow Sharon to her desk. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh yes dear! Aren’t they lovely?!” She handed over the carefully arranged bouquet along with a sticky note. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Mi Amor,</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Sorry to have missed you! Hope to catch you tomorrow. Let me know! </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>🖤</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After the message this morning this was the last thing she had expected. She wasn’t sure how to feel. She would have thought this would have brought her some relief but it made her more confused and apprehensive about whatever Rio wanted to talk about. </span>
<em>
<span>Was this an attempt to soften whatever blow was in store?</span>
</em>
<span> It felt like Rio was toying with her. Not really speaking to her all week, sending that cryptic message, and now she randomly showed up for lunch? </span>
<em>
<span>Something </span>
</em>
<span>was definitely up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“When…?” She uttered as she stared at the note? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sorry dear, didn’t quite catch that.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“When was she here, when did she drop this off?” She snapped at Sharon</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, must have been just after noon. You were still in your meeting with Freddy so I told her not to disturb you.” Sharon explained tentatively. Agatha groaned loudly and stormed back into her office. “Do you want me to put these in a vase for you?” She called after her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha slammed the door behind her, ignoring Sharon’s question, and began to pace back and forth in her office. She could feel her body pulsing with a mix of rage, panic, and fear. She had been right there! Had it not been for fucking Freddy she could have gotten to the bottom of everything! She was frustrated with Sharon, Rio would have been the perfect excuse to end the meeting. </span>
<em>
<span>And then what could Rio want?</span>
</em>
<span> Maybe she had just been busy this week. Had she blown things completely out of proportion? Possibly, but that wouldn’t explain the odd behavior leaving Boston. Had she been thinking about what Agatha said at dinner? Is that what she was hoping to talk about? Or was it something else entirely? Was she trying to break up with her? You wouldn’t really get flowers for someone you were trying to break up with, would you? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There were so many signals going off in her brain that she couldn’t sort through them. Having cycled through each one several times, still coming up with nothing obvious, she fell back into her office chair resigning herself to a sense of powerlessness at the whole situation. She felt blinded and confused and needed to find a way of gaining her control back. The only thing to do was agree to meet Rio, but on her own terms. She grabbed her phone and quickly typed out a message. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Heard you stopped by. Yes, we need to talk. I’ll let you know when I’m home tomorrow. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Short, simple, to the point and hopefully left Rio with just as many questions as Agatha had. Until then she wouldn’t engage, she didn’t want to give Rio any more power over her than she already had. For now, she would prepare herself as best she could for any possible outcome. Especially if she could sense things were going south, she couldn’t be afraid to call the whole thing off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—————————————————-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio sat in her afternoon staff meeting regretting leaving her phone in her office. She thought if that distraction were out of sight she would be able to concentrate. She was wrong, if anything she couldn’t focus no matter how hard she tried. Her mind was stuck on Agatha. </span>
<em>
<span>Had she gotten the note? Had she replied? </span>
</em>
<span>Tomorrow was drawing nearer and with it a storm of uncertainty. She was caught up in a twister of potential scenarios when she heard someone calling her name. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Vidal! This is you!” Shouted Dr. Jones, getting her attention. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, me. For what?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We have you assisting with tomorrow’s surgery. Bright and early.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, of course.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t want to see you here past 10. We need you on your game tomorrow.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes sir!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright that about covers it. Off you go!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As the meeting ended Rio rushed to gather her things and immediately headed for her office. She had about 10 minutes before her last appointment of the day and she wouldn’t be able to focus if she didn’t indulge her curiosity before then. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She swung the door open and threw her things on an empty chair as she rushed to dig through her purse until she found her phone. She awoke the device and there it was, the message from Agatha. As she scanned it quickly her body was struck with a crushing numbness. </span>
<em>
<span>Yes, we need to talk. </span>
</em>
<span>Did…did she know? A million thoughts raced through her head, none of which she had the time to contemplate. She threw her phone down and rushed off to her appointment, all the while realizing it had been a bigger mistake to check before her day was done. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>4:00 am Thursday morning, Rio was on her way to work doing all she could to push the thoughts that had haunted her all night out of her mind. She blasted the first playlist she clicked on as loud as she could tolerate in an attempt to drown out the noise still buzzing inside her. She had to focus, enough to get through this surgery, then she could redirect her energy to the event that had been consuming her for nearly two weeks. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After getting Agatha’s message she had spiraled, debating on whether or not to still even meet with everyone. If Agatha finally knew it kind of took the pressure off of her. That still left a deluge of unanswered questions that she had kept in the corner of her mind. She also figured if she canceled now it could create more questions and she didn’t want anything getting back to Agatha before they talked. By the time she finally rolled into the parking lot she had settled herself enough to accept whatever outcome was in store. She was just glad it would all be over soon. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—————————————————</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As Agatha readied herself for the day she could feel her whole body reacting to the anticipatory anxiety that had been building to this moment. Her head and joints ached, her feet were swollen and stiff, her heartburn was flaring for the fourth day in a row, and that annoying spasm was acting up again. She knew she wouldn’t have much of a break before the seminar so after she slid into a roomy pantsuit and pulled her hair back into a low ponytail, she headed out to the kitchen to try and force herself to eat some sort of breakfast. As she was trying not to burn her last piece of toast Ralph stumbled into the room shirtless with his hair sticking up in every direction. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh good, you’re still here.” He grumbled groggily. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Unfortunately. You just caught me, I’m out the door as soon as this toaster forks over my breakfast.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey, any chance I could steal your key for today?” He asked gently. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Didn’t I give you a key before I left for Boston?” She asked raising an eyebrow. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, and I’m not saying I lost it. I’ve just misplaced it.” He reasoned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, “Fine! Just make sure to leave it under the mat when you leave. I’m coming straight home after the seminar to meet with Rio. I’m sure you’ll still be elbow deep in $3 margaritas at that point.” She said as she dug around in her bag for her key.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good! So you finally relaxed enough to agree to see her!” He chuckled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She gave him a pointed look as she handed over her key. “We’re </span>
<em>
<span>talking </span>
</em>
<span>when I get home.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Ralph perked up at that “Oh, interesting about what?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I wish I knew! She sent me that weird voice message i forwarded to you  yesterday saying there was something she was </span>
<em>
<span>hoping</span>
</em>
<span> to talk to me about. Which of course doesn’t sound suspicious </span>
<em>
<span>at all</span>
</em>
<span>! Then she randomly showed up at my office with lunch and flowers!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh so you saw her yesterday?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No! I was stuck in a bullshit meeting and missed her.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, whatever it is can’t be that bad if she’s still bringing you gifts.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We’ll see. I can tell you, I’m at my limit with whatever game she thinks she’s playing so it better be something good or she should be prepared to lose.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not everything is a game, Agatha.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh really? Because it certainly feels like she’s been playing with my emotional sanity all fucking week.” She sighed as the toaster popped out a half burnt piece of toast. “Fuck! If this is any indication as to how the rest of this day is going to go I’m already over it.” She quickly grabbed the toast and her bag and headed for the door. “Remember, key under the mat! Or I will find you!!” She yelled out to Ralph before slamming the door behind her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>————————————————</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was nearly 3:00 by the time Rio left surgery. Despite the pressure of the day ahead she was able to push through and help perform a successful surgery. Now she had just enough time to shower and change before meeting with everyone. As soon as the luke-warm water hit her all the thoughts and emotions she had held at bay came flooding back. Now was the time. She would dance around the topic to see if she could get one of them to spill and if nothing came of it she would lay all her cards on the table and have them help her sort through everything. It left a gnawing pit in her chest. </span>
<em>
<span>Was she doing the right thing? Would Agatha understand? </span>
</em>
<span>She truly loved and cared for Agatha and just wanted everything to be ok despite whatever came of today. Even if that meant Agatha was better off without her, thought she couldn’t see herself being alright without her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After swirling about every possibility in the shower she dried her hair and threw on some jeans, a tank top, and her favorite blazer. When she checked the clock it was practically 4:30. She ran upstairs, grabbed her things and headed out to happy hour. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>————————————————</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When Jen and Alice walked into the restaurant they quickly spotted Ralph in a far booth, drink in hand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I see you’ve already gotten started!” Jen teased as they slid into the booth across from him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Listen, something tells me this is going to be a doozy, whatever it is.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh, why do you say that?” Jen groaned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She’s meeting up with Agatha after this! To </span>
<em>
<span>talk </span>
</em>
<span>about </span>
<em>
<span>something</span>
</em>
<span>.” Ralph replied </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Great. Well, in that case…” She waved down a waiter “Yeah, I’m going to need whatever he’s drinking as soon as possible.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You got it. Anything I can get for you?” The girl asked Alice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m good with just water, I’ll be driving whoever I can pour into my car later.” The woman nodded and rushed off to get their drinks. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I take it Rio isn’t here yet?” Jen asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I haven’t seen her yet. You think she’s still coming?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She better! I wasn’t planning on paying for shit today.” Jen scoffed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I think she just parked.” Alice said as she glanced out the window. Their eyes followed Rio as she made her way into the restaurant and to their table. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey! Looks like someone’s already got the party started!” She smiled as she scooched into the booth beside Ralph. As soon as she settled the waitress came back with Jen and Alice’s drinks. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And what can I get you?” Asked the girl</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“One of whatever you just brought her and a water please!” Rio requested</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can do!” She headed off to fill the order. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So!” Jen prompted as she took a long sip of her drink. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So…” Rio echoed with a nervous smile, “how have you guys been? It’s been a minute! ” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen and Ralph exchanged looks. “Fine.” Jen responded through a breathy laugh “You gonna tell us why we’re here?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, you know, just had some questions for you. We can get into it once we’ve ordered. How was your week?” She asked, hoping to delay. She wasn’t ready to jump right into it though it was clearly at the top of everyone’s mind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rough, Agatha is on one this week, no thanks to you!” Ralph grumbled, clearly annoyed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, shit sorry about that! What’s…uh…what’s been going on?” She asked innocently, hoping it would lead to more. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She knows you’re up to something. Her leading theories are, dealing with Evanora scared you away, she fucked up when she asked you if you wanted kids, or you're just gonna break up with her.” Ralph stated matter of factly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Woah, what?” Rio gasped, a little taken aback. “I told Jen I wasn’t breaking up with her.”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well that would have been nice to know! </span>
<em>
<span>Jennifer</span>
</em>
<span>! Would have saved me from having to talk her down off a ledge all week!” Ralph groaned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sorry! I didn’t realize it was my job to keep everyone up to speed! Plus you know she would have had a million questions if you came to her with that. You didn’t tell her we were meeting right?” Jen questioned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No! I just told her I was going out for drinks. I didn’t say who it was with. Which by the way, that’s shady as fuck!” He exclaimed, turning to Rio. “Don’t tell Agatha? Between that and the voice message you sent her the other day I can’t really blame her for being suspicious.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What? How so?” Rio asked earnestly “I just told her I was thinking about her, asked if she wanted to meet up after this.” She explained </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Girl, you told her there was something you were hoping to talk with her about. She’s been hyperventilating about what the fuck it could be since you sent it!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No! I didn’t say that!” Rio exclaimed shocked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you realize how many times I had to listen to that message, yes you fucking said it!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright, do we all know what we want to eat?” Asked the waitress, clearly unaware of the tension at the table. They each quickly placed an order then jumped back in as soon as she left. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, fuck! I did not mean to do that!” Rio sighed as she collapsed her face into her hands. “I knew I should have waited until the next morning, I was so tired, but Jen said she was stressed so I was trying to help. I’ve been so busy and have been dreading this all week, it’s been hard to think clearly.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Dreading what?” Alice chimed in, seeing the concern on Rio’s face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio popped her head up and looked around the table nervously as everyone waited for her to elaborate. “Well…it’s about Agatha.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No shit!” Jen sassed “What about Agatha?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well…I’m…um…I guess I’m a little worried about her.” She started tentatively </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh really? Could have fooled me!” Ralph scoffed as he finished his drink. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did she…um…does she…” she struggled to find the right phrasing, before landing on, “Is there anything going on with her that I should know about?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Outside of she’s batshit crazy and you shouldn’t piss her off, there’s nothing I can think of.” Jen offered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She’s only crazy right now because she’s obsessed with you and thinks you don’t like her. If you can fix that you’re probably fine.” Ralph added</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ok, glad to hear that. Is there anything else you’re aware of? Anything else major happening in her life? Anything she’s brought up recently?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Ralph and Jen looked at each other confused. “Outside of the weird gut thing, no.” Ralph assured</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Weird gut thing?” Rio’s interest piqued. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you talking about her blowing chunks that one time?” Jen asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, it’s been more than once. It happened again this week. She seemed to think it was the wine from the night before but I don’t know. She’s been complaining about stomach stuff for a while.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio felt a flush of panic run through her at the mention of wine. “When… uh… when was that, earlier this week?” She asked cautiously.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, Monday or Tuesday I think. She was stressing about you not texting and your weird trip back from Boston so I sat her down in front of Real HouseWives Salt Lake and we had a wine night.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is that what you’re concerned about?” Alice asked, “Her drinking?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not really. I mean yes, but not like that.” Rio stuttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“OH MY GOD! Just spit it out!” Jen groaned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio felt her chest tighten as she tried to breathe and think of what her next words should be. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—-----------------------------------------------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After struggling to focus through the tedious hour long seminar Agatha was finally on her way home. The whole day had been a blur as if she was just going through the motions. She had met with Herb and Freddy for an hour too long before rushing downstairs to collect the musicians for that afternoon. Mr. Kaplan had somehow been told the wrong time so she ended up missing lunch and a donor call to track him down and get him there for a final runthrough. All the while her mind was circling the conversation she was soon to have with Rio, which gave the day an extra layer of unease. As she turned onto her street she could feel her body prick with anticipation, each foot drawing her closer to what felt like an inevitable end. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She turned off her car and sat in her driveway, giving herself a moment to settle before she had to pull the trigger. She let out a deep sigh and pushed her way out of the car. She drug herself up the walkway and onto her porch as she began to search for her keys. It wasn’t until she reached the door did she remember she had given it to Ralph. She dropped her bag onto the floor and picked up the welcome mat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>No key. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She slammed it back down and took a breath. </span>
<em>
<span>Surely, that fucking idiot, did not forget to leave the key. </span>
</em>
<span>She lifted up the mat again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Still no key. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Near her breaking point, she let out a hysterical burst of laughter. She stood up and took a couple paces back. </span>
<em>
<span>Maybe he put it in the mailbox?</span>
</em>
<span> It wouldn’t be the first time he didn’t follow directions. She wandered out to the end of her drive and peered in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A few pieces of junk mail. No key.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She screeched in rage, she was ready to castrate him. She stormed back onto the porch and dumped the contents of her purse onto the ground in search of her phone. She immediately unlocked her phone and called Ralph. The call went straight to voicemail. She rang again. Straight to voicemail. She started pacing as her face radiated with the heat of her anger. She rushed to type out a message.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Where’s the key!!!?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She waited a few moments. Nothing. She called him again, straight to voicemail. She was going to kill him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Answer your fucking phone! Where is my key!!!?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As she waited for a reply that didn’t seem like it was coming she remembered. </span>
<em>
<span>Chili’s</span>
</em>
<span>. If he wasn’t going to answer she’d go pick it up herself. She didn’t care if it ruined his date, at this point she was ready to cause a scene regardless.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—---------------------------------------------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So I’m still trying to figure out the details. I was hoping you could help me, but…I think Agatha might be pregnant.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen burst out laughing, practically choking on a french fry. Alice raised her eyebrows in surprise. Ralph dropped his chicken crisper in his lap, mouth agape. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What the fuck are you talking about?” Jen cackled “There’s no way! You can’t be serious!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Actually, I’m pretty confident about it.” She stared back at Jen worriedly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha? Agatha Harkness? No! She would have said something, right Ralph!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Ralph’s eyes jumped between them panicstricken. “I well…yeah! I mean maybe not. I don’t really know.” He babbled, as his face grew paler and paler. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ralph,” Jen leaned in, eyebrows arched in cautious curiosity. “Did something happen?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ok, I mean I thought maybe, at first, but then the test came back negative.” He could feel everyone’s eyes on him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What, </span>
<em>
<span>the fuck</span>
</em>
<span>, are you talking about.” Jen questioned aggressively. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So…” he laughed nervously “at one point, a few years back, Agatha and I were talking and she mentioned she might still want kids.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh my god!” Jen exclaimed </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And I said, hey, technically you don’t have to be in a relationship to have a kid, right?” He gestured around the table hoping they would agree with him. They all stared back dumbfounded. “Right, so I offered to help make that dream a reality, being the generous friend that I am.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I can’t believe this!” Jen sighed as she shook her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We tried a few times over the years but nothing stuck.” He admitted </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“YOU WERE FUCKING, FOR YEARS!!!?” Jen shouted </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ew god no! We turkey bastered that shit! And after the last time she said she was done trying so we stopped.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Last time? When was the last time?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ooo, let’s see, I think it was around her birthday. So like 5-6 months ago. But like I said the test came back negative.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Please tell me you’re talking about a blood test and not a piece of shit out of a fucking box.” Jen growled </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Huh, so, about that…” he started</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh my god!” Jen breathed as she got up from the table to pace in front of it. “And she never went to the doctor like I told her, did she?!” She barked at Ralph </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She says she has an appointment next month for her stomach problems. But now that I think about it, </span>
<em>
<span>this </span>
</em>
<span>is making more sense.” Ralph explained</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Stomach problems. STOMACH PROBLEMS?” Jen huffed as the weight of what was happening hit her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Everything alright over here?” The waitress asked, seeing the commotion at the table. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen laughed a bit deliriously. “Oooo, far from alright. We’re going to need another round stat!” Jen continued her pacing as the woman went to get them more drinks. “How did </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> know?!” She spun her attention to Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I…uh…actually Lilia figured it out. She told me right before Boston. Once I got down there and saw everything for myself it seemed pretty obvious.” Rio explained. “But I didn’t know how or why and it seemed like Agatha didn’t know. Based on what you’re saying I still don’t think she knows.” She looked at them pleadingly. “This is where I was hoping you might be able to help.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“To break up with her? Because I would be out the fucking door at this point!” Jen griped. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No! I don’t want to break up with her!” She emphasized, “I love her! I just don’t know how to tell her she’s pregnant. Like, I tried when we were down there but I didn’t know any of the details so I didn’t know how to even bring it up without sounding like an ass. Now that I have some context it’ll be easier, but still, not an easy conversation.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> is what you were planning to talk to her about tonight?!” Ralph asked, only now realizing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, yeah. The more time that passes with her not knowing, the greater the risk for complications.” Rio explained</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And based on your sketchy timeline that puts her well into her second trimester!” Jen emphasized. “Fuck! And why didn’t either of you tell me what the hell was going on?!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It wasn’t my choice! She said she didn’t want to worry you when it didn’t work out.” Ralph explained </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Great, well look how that turned out!” Jen whined. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sweetheart!” Alice cooed “Take a breath and have a seat.” She reached her hand out to welcome Jen back into their booth. “If this is what’s happening then we need to stay calm and figure out best how to support Agatha, she’s going to need it.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m this close to supporting her with my foot up her ass for being such a fucking moron!” Jen groaned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Trust me, I get it, but you’re her best friend, especially with your expertise, she’s going to need you.” Alice explained. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh, if you weren’t so hot I’d be mad at you for being right.” Jen sighed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So what’s the plan?” Ralph asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged her shoulders looking between them. “I just have to talk to her, I can’t keep putting it off. She said she’d let me know when she got home.” Rio moved to check her phone. There was nothing from Agatha but there were missed calls from work. “Shit! Sorry, I’ll be right back. Just have to make a call.” She wandered off to a quieter part of the restaurant near the bathrooms. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>In her absence the others took a chance to decompress and pulled out their phones. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“FUCK!” Ralph shrieked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?” Alice and Jen asked in unison</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha! She called like 5 times. Shit! I forgot to put her key under the mat!” He hurried to call her back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is that why she’s walking in now?” Alice asked as they all glanced out the window to see Agatha furiously storming in. </span>

<span>“I thought you said you didn’t tell her about this!” Jen growled as she kicked Ralph under the table. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ow! I didn’t! I told her I was going to Chili’s but that was it.” He whined as he scrambled to hide himself from the woman furiously in search of him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha burst through the doors of the restaurant and quickly zeroed in on Ralph. She thundered towards the table, long hair flowing wildly behind her. “You fucking asshole!” She screeched as Ralph attempted to cower behind the table. “Where’s my goddamn key!?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Ralph drew a shaky hand to the tabletop placing the loose key there. Agatha grabbed it aggressively then turned, noticing Jen and Alice. Her eyes grew wide with fury and confusion before she tilted her head back laughing maniacally. “I know you didn’t blow off going to that </span>
<em>
<span>fucking</span>
</em>
<span> seminar with me just to drink with Jen!” She snapped as her eyes bore into Ralph, still slunk down in the booth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ok, listen, no that’s not… it’s not what you…that’s not what’s happening. I’m here…we’re here…because…because” He stuttered, gesturing to Jen and Alice, scrambling to come up with what exactly to tell her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen glared at Agatha as she looked her up and down, noticing the slight changes in her appearance since she’d last seen her. As she tired of hearing Ralph ramble, she cut in, “We’re here because of you bitch!” Jen snapped.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>At that Agatha whipped around. “Excuse me? What the fuck are you talking about?!” The fuming rage she had for Ralph was now solely directed to Jen along with a blanket of confusion at her statement.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha sit.” Jen commanded, doing her best to control her rage. If Agatha was already here there was no point in delaying things further. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jennifer, I do not have time for whatever bullshit you guys are on about. I’m supposed to be home now meeting with Rio, but instead I had to drive all the way over here because some idiot forgot to leave the key!” Agatha still fixated on her delayed conversation with Rio, moved to leave as Jen reached out, catching her by the arm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well you’re gonna make time. Sit the fuck down.” She gestured to Rio’s empty seat, her glare leaving no room for argument as she pulled Agatha back into the booth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fine!” Agatha growled as she jerked her arm away from Jen, “But I’m only sitting because my feet hurt and I want to.” she said unable to give her the satisfaction of having won. “This better be good!” she said as she shoved Ralph further into the booth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t know about </span>
<em>
<span>good</span>
</em>
<span>.” Ralph mumbled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shut up!” Agatha and Jen shouted at him in unison, neither one willing to indulge his sarcasm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jeez! Ok, well then are you gonna tell her or should I?” He asked exasperatedly, looking to Jen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Tell me what?” Agatha barked as her confusion grew. </span>
<em>
<span>What were they up to? Why had this been such a big secret?</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll tell her.” Came an ever familiar voice from behind Agatha. She turned to look up into Rio’s honey amber eyes, brimming with worry and doubt, yet her apologetic half smile revealed the loving warmth she reserved only for Agatha. “Hello, my love.” She hummed tentatively, as she leaned against the side of the booth. The wooden post anchoring her in place as her knees threatened to buckle under the weight of the present moment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes grew wide with shock and confusion. After everything that happened in Boston, after their awkward journey back, after practically ghosting her all week save for a few cryptic messages, here she was in the flesh. </span>
<em>
<span>Was this the secret all along?</span>
</em>
<span> A sense of overwhelming dread coiled in her stomach. She couldn’t think of one good reason they would all intentionally meet without her. The first thought her mind clung to was, </span>
<em>
<span>this is the end. </span>
</em>
<span>And if this was the end she had to be the one to wield the power. All at once the hurricane of emotions stilled within her as she snapped her gaze between Rio and her friends seated around her. “What </span>
<em>
<span>the fuck</span>
</em>
<span> is going on here?” She commanded to no one in particular. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Cariño, there’s something I’ve been meaning to talk to you about.” Rio started cautiously, finding her courage. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha was shocked to find that it was Rio who had spoken up. She had figured Jen to be the most likely culprit of this intervention. The audacity for her to talk so sweetly after the week she had put her through. “Oh, don’t Cariño me!” Agatha snapped as she stood from the table, squaring up to Rio. “Yes, we do need to talk! I don’t see you all week, I barely hear from you, and where do I find you? Having some weird secret meeting with my friends? Whose idea was this?!” She turned eyeing Jen and Ralph, for surely if it hadn’t been Jen it was Ralph. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mine.” Rio admitted. “I was hoping to get their advice before I talked to you.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The sting she felt at that confession. If it had been Rio who set it up there could only be one reason. If this was the moment it all ended she had to be the one to pull the trigger first.  “What, so you could figure out how to break up with me or something? Well don’t bother, I’m happy to take care of that for you. We’re done!” She turned quickly on her heel and headed for the door with Rio following close behind.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha, wait! Please let me explain.” Rio begged as they pushed through the doors. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You don’t have to explain anything! I knew this was too good to be true!” The last words broke on her lips as she fought back the tears burning her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha, please! I’m not trying to break up with you!” Rio rushed to catch up with her at her car.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh really?! Well, you have a funny way of showing it!” She scoffed as she searched her bag for her car keys. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha! Listen to me.” Rio begged, “I’m sorry, I never meant for it to go like this!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha threw her bag on the ground in a huff, unable to find the keys, and turned on Rio. “WHAT?! What is it then? If you’re not breaking up with me then what is it about me that has you hiding away and scrambling to my so-called friends for advice? Huh?” She spat, voice full of hurt and anger, as tears pricked at her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stood just a few feet away on the sidewalk, her heart raced as she took a deep breath. She closed her eyes and swallowed hard, finding the last bit of bravery she could muster, then looked back at Agatha. “Agatha, you’re pregnant.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The air stilled around them as the weight of Rio’s words settled between them. Agatha shook her head, eyebrows scrunched in confusion as her mind struggled to process what she thought she had heard. She felt an ache in her lungs and realized she had stopped breathing. As she gulped in a breath of air she could feel herself return to her body. “What?” It was the only thing she could bring her lips to speak. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re pregnant. I…I didn’t know how to tell you.” Rio uttered shakily. Eyebrows stitched together in concern.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at Rio for a moment, dumbfounded, before a slow chuckle rose from her chest which soon evolved into a bursting fit of laughter. It was the most absurd thing she’d heard yet! Her knees buckled as she leaned against her car, gasping for air. Eventually she composed herself enough to look back at Rio, who was standing stark and somber, eyes wide in sincerity. “Oh! Oh, you’re serious! </span>
<em>
<span>That’s </span>
</em>
<span>what this has all been about?” she gasped as she straightened herself out. “No! Hehe, no that’s … that’s not possible.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh really?!” Shouted Jen as she led the other two out to meet them. “Ralph seems to think there’s at least a small chance given what you two have been up to the last…” She leaned back, muttering to Ralph, “how many years?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Three, I think.” He whispered back</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Three years?” She called out then quickly turned back to Ralph, “Really?! Three years and neither of you said anything? Damn, I guess I see where I stand.” Jen sassed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha could feel her heart race at hearing that secret be revealed.  Her body rushed with a wave of embarrassment and panic. “Ralph, what the fuck did you tell them?!” She growled at him through gritted teeth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Listen, it seemed relevant to the conversation. Besides, you have to admit, it kind of explains a lot.” Ralph reasoned </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What do you mean?” Agatha scoffed incredulously. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well…” He started, looking around at the others for support. “Your weird stomach issues for one.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The sudden vomiting.” Jen added</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Half your clothes don’t fit and you’ve cried like every day this week.” Ralph continued </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The heartburn and bloating.” Rio mentioned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Your tits look amazing though.” Alice commented, causing everyone to turn in shock. Jen looked practically murderous. “Juuust trying to cut the tension!” She backed off with her hands raised in surrender. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha felt the ember of rage reignite inside her as grief and disappointment weighed down upon her. These were supposed to be her friends and it seemed as though they were using her most vulnerable moments against her, and to what end? They couldn’t really believe she was pregnant! </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ok, what do you want me to say? Yes, Ralph had been trying to help me have a kid and no I didn’t tell you about it. We stopped months ago! It never worked so there was no point. It’s done! It’s over! It wasn’t meant to be! I thought, at the very least, I might be able to move on. Have a loving relationship, but apparently not! I don’t know what fucking possessed you, </span>
<em>
<span>Ralph, </span>
</em>
<span>but you’ve managed to convince my girlfriend I’m pregnant. No wonder things have been weird between us.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey! Don’t look at me! I only mentioned it after she brought it up!” He shot back in defense. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha frowned in confusion, still unable to put the pieces in the right order. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We didn’t do shit! She came to us with this revelation!” Jen clarified, pointing to Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha turned her attention back to Rio, eyes full of pain and confusion. “What is she talking about?” She uttered still in disbelief. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio rocked back and forth on her feet as her heartbeat thumped in her ears. She could feel the tangle of nerves working their way up her throat. She felt like she was holding on to Agatha by a thread and if there was any chance of salvaging the love they had she needed to bear her soul and come clean. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I found out you were pregnant just before Boston. It seemed impossible, for so many reasons but then there was the proof. I spent my whole journey down trying to figure out what happened and why you didn’t tell me. Was there someone else, was it a one night stand, had you been attacked? So many things went through my mind. And then…I saw you, and all the questions and doubts vanished. I didn’t care why or how, I just knew I wanted you. I wanted us, whatever that looked like.Then it quickly became obvious you didn’t know, which created even more questions, and it turned into how to I even begin to tell you? I came close a few times but each time I just fell apart or clammed up. I was so afraid.” Rio took a heavy breath to keep the tears from falling. “I didn’t want to lose you! You are the </span>
<em>
<span>best </span>
</em>
<span>thing that’s ever happened to me.” Rio’s body was shaking as the tears fought to burst forth. “I…I’m so sorry! I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t know what to say. I needed time, I needed to think. I needed help, I needed people who loved and cared for you, who understood you to help. I needed to know they would be there for you if…” Her voice broke as she fought to finish the thought. “If…after…after you knew everything…you wanted to end things.” At that the tears finally fell in silent sheets like rain. “I love you, more than anything in this life. I would do anything to make sure that you’re ok, that you’re both healthy and happy. Even if that means losing you forever.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The four of them stood there in different shades of confusion and concern as they tried to stitch together the pieces of Rio’s confession. Fear and panic pricked at Agatha’s chest seeing the earnest plea for understanding in Rio’s waterlogged eyes. The words had been an avalanche of pent up truths that she was struggling to comprehend. It just wasn’t true, it didn’t make sense. Breaking through the disorienting fog Jen’s voice rang out. “Wait, you said proof. What proof?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s face grew white with panic. At this point she had already revealed so much, there was just the final kernel of truth that still weighed heavy on her heart. “I wasn’t the one who figured it out. It was Lilia, she told me right before I left.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Man, does she have the worst timing or what?” Ralph huffed under his breath. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So, what? All of this is based off your aunt’s witchy intuition and my inconveniently timed digestive issues?” Agatha asked incredulously, trying desperately to hide the panic behind her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio gulped as she dared to confess. “Well…yes and no.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Great, what is that supposed to mean?” Agatha scoffed, growing more impatient by the second. She was tired of whatever game they thought they were playing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio closed her eyes and took a big breath before heading over to her car. “I just want to be clear, I had no idea this was happening, I do not condone it, and we’ve had a </span>
<em>
<span>lengthy </span>
</em>
<span>discussion about boundaries after the fact.” Rio began digging around in her center console as Agatha turned to the others who seemed just as perplexed. Eventually Rio returned holding what looked to be a plastic baggie. “Again, this was a gross violation of your, well everything, and I’m so SO sorry. But, when she told me she gave me this.” She walked over and handed Agatha the bag. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha turned it over in her hand, trying to process what she was looking at. Three strips of paper, all of which appeared to be positive pregnancy tests. “Is this some sort of joke?” She coughed bitterly as the stinging tears returned to her eyes. How could she be so cruel? She knew about the miscarriage, this is not something she could find humor in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I wish it was, cariño.” Rio choked out as her heart stuttered, seeing the pain she was putting her through. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What is it?” Jen asked as they all walked closer. Agatha, still in a state of shock, handed the bag over to Jen. She took a second to examine the package before it clicked what had happened.  “Oh damn! Yeah, that’s…that’s kind of fucked up!” she exclaimed as she passed the bag to the others. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stood frozen, a numb panic pulsed through her body as her brain fought to understand what was happening. “No…no, that’s wrong. It didn’t work. I checked, Ralph you saw! It didn’t work! It never worked!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Right?! That’s what I told them! We checked and it was negative.” Ralph reaffirmed</span>
<span>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>“These things aren’t always reliable! False negatives and positives happen all the time!” Jen explained</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So it’s false?! There’s no way! I’m not pregnant! I can’t be. I’m NOT pregnant!” She began to grow frantic as her gut twinged at the possibility. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, It also may not pick it up if you tested too early. Which is why you should always follow up with your doctor! Which is something I would have told you if I had known!” Jen lectured as she handed the tests back to Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, no, it’s not.. I’m not…STOP LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT!” She screamed at the others who looked on in horror as the pieces began to fall in place. Falling asleep at the office, her swollen joints and aching back, now that she thought about it, </span>
<em>
<span>when did she have her last period? </span>
</em>
<span>Two months ago? And that was spotting at best! Her hands began to tremble as her breathing grew ragged. She let her gaze wander down to her stomach as she placed a shaky hand right below her belly button. In that moment she could feel the odd spasm return, light, like she had swallowed a butterfly. Her eyes grew wide in fear and panic. Her head snapped up looking at the crowd around her, their faces a mixture of concern and unease, unsure of what to do or say. She could feel the color drain from her face as saliva began to pool in her mouth. Before she realized what was happening her feet were carrying her through the parking lot, to where? She had no idea. Rio immediately took off behind her, worried about what she might do. The other three looked on in amused confusion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why is she running?” Ralph asked </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I have no clue!” Jen huffed as they watched Agatha come to a stop at the Chili’s sign, spewing the contents of her stomach at the base, to which they all groaned in response. Having watched the commotion from the windows their waitress and a manager rushed out to check on them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Everything ok out here? Do you need anything?” Asked the stout balding manager.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Maybe water and a towel?” Jen suggested </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And we’ll take the check.” Alice added</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You got it.” They muttered and rushed back inside, quickly returning with the requested items. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rubbed gentle circles on Agatha’s back and held her hair until the vomiting subsided. She wasn’t sure how she had expected Agatha to react, running had definitely been a shock. She braced herself as Agatha slowed her heaving and moved to lean against the sign. Rio took a step toward her, reaching out to adjust a piece of hair behind her ear. As soon as she neared Agatha’s face she felt a smack push her away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t touch me!” Agatha screeched as she looked up at Rio with panic-stricken eyes. “Get away from me!” Agatha pulled herself away from the sign and pushed past Rio to head back toward her friends. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha? You ok?” Ralph asked timidly as he met her half-way across the lot.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What do you think?!” She spat angrily as she worked to steady herself. Fear gripped her as she accepted the real possibility that they were telling her the truth. If that was the case, who knows what untold harm she had already caused this child. She needed to know, she needed undeniable proof. In that moment her mind went to the one person that could provide her guidance. “Jen! Please, Jen, what do I do?! I need to know! Is it real? Is this really happening?” She cried as her breathing became short and erratic. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen, seeing Agatha’s devastation, let her anger fall. Despite their differences and Agatha’s questionable decisions, she couldn’t help but feel compassion for the woman before her. “Hey, hey it’s going to be alright. We’ll figure this out.” She said as she rushed forward to embrace her. “I think it might be a good idea to go to the hospital. We can get real confirmation, either way, and get everything checked out.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled herself away from Jen, “I…I couldn’t find my car keys, can you see if I dropped them inside? I’m going nowhere without them.” She shuddered through sobs. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sure, I’ll have Ralph check. You know you’re not driving right?” Jen gave her a reassuring half smile as she ushered Agatha into Alice’s van. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As the door closed behind her the silence of the car only gave more room for the noise inside her mind to buzz louder in warning. </span>
<em>
<span>What if something’s wrong, something could be wrong.</span>
</em>
<span> Her ears rang, trying to catch the muffled conversations happening just outside the vehicle. She stared listlessly out the windshield as her friends organized themselves around her. Jen made a call, Ralph and Rio headed back inside the restaurant, Alice waited patiently for Jen to finish the call before they both joined her in the car. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I called Vicky, she said she’ll meet us at the entrance.” Jen said, resting a hand on Agatha’s shoulder as they pulled out of the parking space.  Agatha rolled to her side, leaning her head against the door as she tucked her legs beneath her. She let her arms settle in her lap, wrapped tightly around her waist as if she was trying to hold herself together. She glanced out the side mirror and caught Rio exiting the restaurant. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is everyone coming?” She mumbled, devoid of emotion, as she stared out the window. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, Ralph’s got your stuff, they’re going to meet us there.” Hearing no reaction from Agatha she asked, “Is that ok?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s fine” she breathed, unsure of what to feel. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—---------------------------------------------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio gathered Agatha’s bag from the ground and collected the glasses and mints that had fallen out. Ralph walked over and dropped her keys in the bag. “Found them under the table. She must have dropped them when she freaked out. Also, wasn’t sure if you wanted your chicken crispers so I grabbed them just in case.” He held up the bag containing all the food that practically no one had touched. “You driving or should I?” He asked, “I’ll warn you, I downed another margarita when I was in there. What a day! Am I right?” He huffed another breath, slapping Rio on the back in brotherly camaraderie. Rio moved no other muscle than her eyes as she glared up at Ralph, seeing his laissez-faire attitude about the whole thing. “What?” he asked.</span>
<span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Should I even go?” Rio choked out, half broken.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What do you mean?” Ralph asked earnestly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Does she even want me there? You heard what she said, we’re done. She pushed me away.” She glanced down at the bag, holding onto it in a vice grip, as if it could be the last piece of Agatha she may ever see. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, well, honestly? Given the context, I wouldn’t take it to heart. Not entirely at least. I mean, you’ve known since before Boston, so that’s not great. Then you practically ghosted her for a week, also not great. She was </span>
<em>
<span>stressing </span>
</em>
<span>about that! But it’s kind of hard to blame you. </span>
<em>
<span>I</span>
</em>
<span> wouldn’t have known what to do in your situation. You didn’t get her pregnant, you just happened to find out before she did. It’s probably the worst timing ever.” He chuckled </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know it’s not my fault this is happening, I just…that could not have gone worse! I really fucked this up.” She leaned against her car, burying her face in her hands.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I mean, sure, this could have gone a bit better, but knowing Agatha, eh, not by much. The Chili’s parking lot was a good touch though, gave a nice backdrop for the drama. Which, if you’re planning to stick around, you should get used to.” He reassured her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You really think I should go?” She asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Absolutely!” He hiccuped “Because I’m not paying for an uber.” He wrapped his arm around her shoulder, pulling her into his side. “Despite everything that just happened I do think you’re good for her. I don’t think I’ve seen her this happy in years!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Really?” she huffed as she cracked a smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Definitely! Though, not to say this couldn’t change things, this was… a lot. Just, take it easy, give her some time.” He released her and walked around to her passenger door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She chuckled as she went to unlock her doors. “You know this means you’re going to be a dad, technically.” she said as she slid into the driver's seat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Huh, I honestly hadn’t considered that until this moment.” he grimaced at the thought as he closed the door behind him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—---------------------------------------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha laid back against the cold, hard, exam room table, the paper crinkled beneath her as she shifted her weight nervously. Jen was out in the hallway chatting with the doctor she had called to meet them. Dr. Victoria Allen, a slight woman with dirty blonde hair and large green glasses. She had greeted them with a calm warm voice and gentle smile though she didn’t entirely understand the context of what was happening at the time. She and Jen had another nurse get her set up in the room while Jen filled her in and they discussed a course of action. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>In the waiting silence Agatha couldn’t help but reflect on everything that had led up to this moment. The years she and Ralph had tried with nothing working. Finally giving up and accepting it wasn’t meant for her. Starting to move on, finding Rio, feeling love and hope for the first time since Wanda. Rio’s odd behavior in Boston and the following week and now knowing why. It just didn’t feel real, any of it. It had been months since she and Ralph had their final attempt, could she really be that far along? Until she could see it for herself, it still seemed impossible. She grazed a hand across her stomach feeling the small rise of her abdomen. She had had meals that left her feeling more pregnant than this. Before she could spiral further into denial the door handle clicked. She sat up suddenly, her heart racing, as Jen peeked her head in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey, you want me in here for this, or…” Jen asked calmly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes!” Agatha replied before she could finish the sentence. “Please, stay.” Her eyes gleamed with fear and trepidation. She couldn’t do this alone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Of course!” Jen nodded reassuringly as she and Dr. Allen entered the room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey, Agatha! Nice to see you again.” Vicky lilted as she reached out and shook Agatha’s hand. “Jen tells me you’ve had quite the surprise today!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha grimaced at the carefully chosen words. “You could say that!” She breathed nervously, glancing at Jen, who gave her a reassuring half smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, why don’t we take a look and see what’s going on? I’ll have you lay back and lift your shirt up a bit for me.” Dr. Allen took a napkin and tucked it into the waistband of her pants before squirting a sizable amount of ultrasound jelly right above. She turned off the lights and turned on the machine, grabbing the wand. Agatha took a breath as her heart pounded in her chest. She could feel the tingling numbness of her nervousness engulf her body as she did her best to remain calm. Jen moved to stand behind Vicky, resting her hand on Agatha’s knee for support. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As the wand pressed into her stomach she pulled her head back to stare at the ceiling, none of this felt real. For a moment she hovered in the limbo of not knowing until she felt Jen squeeze her knee as she sucked in a gasp. Agatha chanced a glance down to find Jen’s eyes wide with her hand over her mouth in shock as she stared at the screen. Agatha snapped her head back up as she felt her face getting red with panic. </span>
<em>
<span>This wasn’t happening. How could this be happening?</span>
</em>
<span> She could feel the tears once again stinging her eyes as drops began to fall from the far corners. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So…” Vicky started “I’m not going to keep you in suspense. There is definitely a baby in there.” She turned the screen to face Agatha revealing the tiny profile of the being inside her, a tiny hand pressed up against their cheek. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As soon as Agatha caught sight of the fully formed baby her sobs broke free as she clasped her hands over her mouth in disbelief. </span>
<em>
<span>How? How was this possible? How had she not known? How had she not realized?</span>
</em>
<span> Immediately fear gripped her, “Is…is everything ok? Is the baby ok?” She choked out through sobs. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So far so good. Ten fingers, ten toes. We’re moving around a bit. I’d say we’re a good size for 20-22 weeks? Does that sound right?” Dr. Allen asked. Agatha nodded her head, unable to speak further. “Let’s get a check on that heartbeat.” A few clicks later and the whooshing sound of the baby’s heartbeat was echoing throughout the room. “That’s what we like to hear, nice, strong heartbeat.” Agatha’s sobbing intensified at the sound. The baby was real, and alive, and she hadn’t known. Guilt flowed into every crack this news had created. </span>
<em>
<span>What had she done? What was she going to do now?</span>
</em>
<span> In an instant everything about her life had just changed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen moved to grab some tissues, handing them to Agatha and taking a few for herself at that point. Dr. Allen moved to turn off the machine and clean the goo off Agatha’s stomach. “I’m sorry, I know this probably wasn’t how you expected your day to turn out. This is definitely a lot to take in. I do want to give you some reassurance that everything looks alright so far, I don’t have any immediate concerns as of yet. However, since we’re just finding out about this little one now, I definitely want to go ahead and run some blood tests. Given how far along you are we would be able to do an anatomy scan as well, make sure everything is developing properly.  I do have to run and check on a patient, but as long as that goes well I should have time, if you’re up for it. I know today has been a long day.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I…yes, whatever we need to do.” She cried.  “I need to make sure everything’s ok!” She breathed shakily before looking back to Jen as she sat up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Great! I’ll send in Elena to take the blood work and I’ll be back before long. Jen I’ll text you if I get held up but I should see you both again in about 45 mins.” she said then quickly headed out the door. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned forward, resting her elbows on her knees and hanging her head in her hands. “Jen! What the fuck?!” she groaned through her fingers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re telling me! Agatha! What the fuck?!” Jen sighed, exasperatedly, clearing away the last of her own tears. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I didn’t know! Jen! I didn’t know!” She shook her head raising it to find Jen’s disconcerting stare. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know.” Jen hummed reassuringly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What if there’s something wrong? What if I did something to hurt the baby because I didn’t know? For fuck’s sake, I drank nearly a whole bottle of wine earlier this week!” She let out a gasping sigh, “I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to forgive myself!” Her chest shuddered at the thought as her eyes once again misted with tears. Her breathing came in short quick bursts as panic pressed in on her chest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey! Hey!” Jen rushed forward, capturing her in a hug. “You heard her, everything looks alright so far. I’m sure it’ll be fine! Vicky’s amazing! She’s going to take great care of you both no matter what.” She leaned back brushing a few hairs away from her face. “You’d be surprised how resilient they can be. And this one? Stubborn, a fighter, knows how to make a dramatic appearance. Definitely your kid!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>At that she let out a small laugh, “You really think it’s going to be ok?” She sighed shakily. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So far so good. Besides, you have an awesome team. There's a whole group out there waiting to make sure you’re ok. This kid’s going to have so many people who love and adore them.” Jen reached over, grabbing a few more tissues for her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shit Rio, what am I going to do about Rio?” She gasped, realizing she was one of the people waiting for her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, what do you want to do about Rio?” Jen asked, crossing her arms and leaning against the counter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I have no clue! Trying to think about this and that right now is a little overwhelming.” she admitted, still trying to come to grips with her new reality. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Then don’t. Focus on this. If Rio really wants this like she claims she does, she’ll wait until you’re ready.” Jen advised.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded as she looked back down at her stomach, her hand lazily rubbing circles where the wand had been. She was petrified, intimidated by the future now before her, though a small part of her glowed at the thought, </span>
<em>
<span>it had worked. Somehow it had worked. </span>
</em>
<span>She closed her eyes and took a deep breath willing her body to ease into a calm it was struggling to find. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha?” Jen asked carefully. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hmm?” She hummed in reply as her eyes cracked open to look at Jen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why didn’t you tell me?” Jen muttered through a half apologetic smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha took a deep sigh before replying. “I…uh…didn’t want to worry you.” She laughed at that thought now. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?” Jen snickered, bemused.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, after everything with Wanda and the miscarriage, you really picked up the pieces. I was a mess, I know it wasn’t easy, and I took a lot out of you. I didn't think it would be fair to drag you through what was bound to be another disaster if I didn’t have to. Look how that turned out! I still managed to drown you in my bullshit.” Agatha looked at Jen with guilt ridden eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha, while I appreciate the sentiment, I know what I signed up for. Being your friend comes with disaster and drama around every corner. You are a mess and while it may be exhausting at times I wouldn’t trade it for anything. So thank you, but loop me in the next time you’re trying to have a kid!” She joked “It’s kind of my thing and I give great advice.” Jen smirked with a smug look on her face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh believe me I know! Don’t be surprised if I call you everyday with questions.” She let a smile crack at the corner of her lips. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You gonna let me in the delivery room at least? I think I’ve earned it at this point.” Jen added pointedly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You think I’m going to push a human out of my body and not have you there to talk me through it? Please, you’re putting together my birth plan.” Agatha managed a laugh at that, encouraging a chortle from Jen at the thought.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Damn, you’re really having a baby!” Jen exclaimed, still dumbfounded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I am really having a baby! Fuck me!” She collapsed back onto the table, laughing at the absurdity of the situation, just as Elena knocked and entered for the blood tests. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You ok if I go out and check on the others?” Jen asked as she headed toward the door. Agatha nodded as the nurse prepped her to take blood. “You cool if I tell them? They’re going to want an update.” Jen asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Saves me the trouble of having to do it.” Agatha sighed, feeling the weight of that burden dissipate from her shoulders.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You want anyone else back here?” She thought to check as her hand was on the doorknob.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head. “I’ll catch Ralph at home. Rio, I…I just...” She swallowed, feeling a lump in her throat. “I just need some time.” She choked out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I understand. I’ll be back in time for the scan.” She said as she headed out to the lobby. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>————————————————</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice sat in the waiting room, flipping through a Highlights magazine as Rio and Ralph skittered in with Agatha’s things in hand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey! Any news?” Rio asked, rushing to her with Agatha’s things in her hands.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, nothing yet. Jen’s been back there with her for a while. I was thinking about running to grab a snack. I didn’t get to eat much of the food we ordered.” Alice admitted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t worry I got everything to-go!” Ralph exclaimed as he swung the bag of food around to sit on a table nearby. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re kidding!” Alice snickered as Ralph sorted through their leftovers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Absolutely! There was no way I was going to let them just throw this away!” He opened a clamshell container and began stuffing his face with french fries.  “How much longer do you think it’s gonna be?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Depends,” Rio shrugged as she joined them at the table. “They’ll probably have to run a bunch of tests and stuff.” She hung her head, rubbing her eyes with the palms of her hands, before she stared up at the other two in awe. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How can you eat at a time like this?” Rio asked incredulously, seeing the other two tucking into the food. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sorry but I am starving!” Alice admitted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Eh, either she’s pregnant or not, nothing I can do about it now. I’ve already fulfilled my duties.” Ralph explained through a mouthful of chicken.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio laughed at their nonchalance “You gonna be this calm when she’s pushing the kid out?” she asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>If</span>
</em>
<span> she ends up pushing out a kid, I’ll be in the same spot I’m in right now. Patiently waiting in the waiting room, probably eating something then too.” he shrugged</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And what if she has it at the house?” Rio asked, curious.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Ralph wrinkled his nose in disgust. “Ew, why would she do that?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Things happen. Babies have their own timing. Some people prefer it actually.” She explained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh! Hopefully, I’ll be cruising somewhere tropical if that’s the case.” He groaned before taking another bite of chicken.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’d really miss the birth of your child?” Rio asked, stunned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know that kid has my DNA but it’s never been mine. I’m more of a gay uncle if anything. I'm happy to teach them how to misbehave, get on their mothers nerves, and take them on expensive vacations when they get their heart broken. Parenting, that’s all Agatha.” He swallowed the bite he was chewing and looked at Rio. “Maybe you too? Did you want kids?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled at the thought. “I considered it but never thought I’d meet the right person to have them with. When I found out she was pregnant I was scared, sure, but I thought about what it might look like with her. I’ve never wanted anything more in my life.” She gave him a half smile as her eyes misted with tears. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well looks like we’re about to find out if your dream is coming true. Here comes Jen.” Ralph nodded, prompting everyone to turn and find Jen walking towards them, arms and eyebrows raised as she shook her head in disbelief. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well?” Rio asked anxiously as they rose to meet Jen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh she’s pregnant alright! Congrats daddy!” She nudged Ralph on the shoulder</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ok we’re gonna squash that right now! Gunkle Ralph, if you please!” Ralph exclaimed </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How’s she doing? Is everything alright? Is the baby ok?” Rio questioned in a panic.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She’s clearly shaken up, definitely in shock, but so far everything looks alright. They're running some blood tests now and Vicky says she has time to do the anatomy scan so I’m going to stick around for that.” Jen explained as she nodded in apology to Alice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is she up to seeing anyone?” Rio asked timidly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen shook her head. “This has been a lot. I’m sure she just needs time to process everything.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, yeah of course.” Rio breathed, though her eyes shimmered with the weight of disappointment. “I…uh…I’m gonna get out of here then, I guess.” She sniffled as she started to gather her things. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Of course.” Jen murmured, as she watched Rio try to hold herself together. “I have your number so I’ll keep you updated.” she offered in solace. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I appreciate that!” Rio flashed her a teary smile. “Here’s Agatha’s stuff. Ralph, you staying here or am I taking you back to your car?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ooo, any chance you’d take me to the house? I don’t want to be here but I probably shouldn’t drive yet.” He grimaced in apology.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, can do.” Rio chuckled under her breath. “I’ll see you around I guess?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen nodded as she and Alice waved them off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I better get back there and see how things are going. You going to hang around here or head out?” Jen asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice shrugged, “I’ll hang out until you two are done. Someone’s gotta take you back.” She flashed Jen a sympathetic smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re the best!” Jen leaned in pressing a soft affectionate kiss to Alice’s lips. “You’d tell me if you found out I was pregnant right?” She asked jokingly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is there any chance of that?” Alice giggled, eyebrows raised.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Absolutely zero! This would only happen to Agatha!” She let out a small laugh before planting another quick kiss on her lips. “Alright, we’ll be out before long.” She said as she turned to head back to Agatha’s room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—————————————————-</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>A few hours later, after running all possible tests, Agatha, followed by Jen and Alice, crossed the threshold of her home. Ralph jumped up from the couch, switching off the reality show he was watching, to greet them. “So? How we feeling, mama?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes to glare at him. “Exhausted!” She said as she dropped her things and immediately collapsed onto the couch with a groan.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How’d everything go?” He asked, looking to Jen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Apparently, baby is happy and healthy! No issues or abnormalities. Agatha on the other hand, what’d they say?” She asked, half amused as she already knew the answer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Dehydrated, high blood pressure, low blood sugar. I’m slightly low on amniotic fluid but if I fix the dehydration that should help the rest.” She droned from the couch, resting a hand on her forehead.   </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“They gave her some fluids before we left for good measure.” Jen explained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So, when do we get to meet the little gremlin?” Ralph asked excitedly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Due date is June 2nd?” Jen said as she looked to Agatha who shot a thumbs up from the couch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Excellent! And do we know what we’re having?” Ralph was positively buzzing as he tapped his fingers along the countertop. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen looked to Agatha to let her take the lead as she sat up a bit on the couch to further join the conversation. “Not sure why you’re holding back now. Are we really keeping it a surprise after everything?” She scoffed at Jen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I wasn’t sure if you cared.” Jen shrugged.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“At this point no! I’m just glad he’s healthy.” Agatha sighed as she laid back down on the couch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“He? Him? It’s a boy?” Ralph cried giddily</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, it’s a boy.” Agatha confirmed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hell yeah! A little Ralph Jr!” He shouted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh absolutely not!” Agatha scoffed as she sat bolt upright on the couch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I thought you said you weren’t the father!” Jen smirked </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I mean no, but come on it just makes sense. He’s going to drive you just as crazy as I do!” He chuckled as he pointed to Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“He already has with all the drama he’s put me through! Gods, what a mess! I have to figure out how to tell work, I have half the time I should to get ready for him, and then of course I’m going to give birth in, what, 4 months?!” She slumped back down into the couch pressing her palms against her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Work will just have to deal with it, are you planning to go in tomorrow?” Jen asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I have to! We have this stupid dress rehearsal on Saturday that I’m still pulling together. They want to do a lunch beforehand for whatever reason.” She rolled her eyes in frustration. Of course all of this had to happen now. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Anyone you can delegate that to? Might want to take it easy this weekend.” Alice asked concernedly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll be fine. I’d rather try and stick to my regular schedule as much as possible. There’s a lot I have to start putting into place if I’m going to be on leave by summer. I’ll just have to make time to meet with HR tomorrow.” She sighed, dreading the several conversations and questions she was bound to face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ok, just make sure you don’t overdo it. As for baby stuff, we’ve got you covered. I started putting together a list when they hooked you up to the IV. I’ll send it to you now.” Jen offered as she pulled out her phone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know this means you’re being evicted.” Agatha chuckled at Ralph. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Listen, I’ll gladly relinquish my squatters rights to the little guy.” Ralph said gleefully</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Does that mean you’ll help me move all your shit out of the room before you leave for your contract?” Agatha questioned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I may even be persuaded to help paint if we get there in time!” He beamed at her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m gonna hold you to that!” She smirked, pointing at him warningly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m gonna head to the bathroom then you good to head out?” Jen asked, turning to Alice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, sounds good!” Alice hummed as she pressed a quick kiss to Jen’s lips before watching her walk away with heart filled eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha and Ralph exchanged knowing looks. “You two seem to have really hit it off!” Ralph commented once Jen was out of earshot. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Alice blushed before turning to him. “Yeah, I’ve actually been thinking about asking her to move in with me.” She admitted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The two gasped in unison, pleasantly surprised. “Oh my gosh! When?!” Shrieked Ralph</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well her birthday is coming up at the end of the month. I thought it could be part of her present?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Have you two talked about it?” Agatha asked, thrilled to have something to talk about besides her issues. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“A few times, but I think it would still be a surprise. Do you think it’s a bad idea?” Alice looked back with questioning eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No!” They shouted unanimously “She’s going to be thrilled to get out of that box she calls an apartment!” Agatha chuckled before Jen’s voice rang out from the hallway. “Agatha!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?!” She screeched back</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t tell me these were the tests you were using.” Jen stormed down the hallway, throwing the box in Agatha’s lap. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ouch! Yes, what of it?” she said as she picked up the box.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“They’re fucking expired!” Jen growled as she rolled her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, they expire?” She said, examining the package.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Unbelievable!” Jen huffed sardonically as she took Alice by the hand and headed for the door.  “I swear, if you weren’t pregnant right now I’d slap you for your stupidity!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Love you too Jen!” She called as she waved them both out. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as the door shut a heavy silence rested in the air. Agatha sat, contemplating the events of the day, still trying to settle herself in the reality she hadn’t woken up to this morning. Ralph, seeing her withdraw into herself, glided over to join her on the couch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey, wanna tell me what you’re thinking?” He said as she nudged her with his toes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She tore her eyes from the fuzzy haze of the coffee table she had been zoning out at to gaze at Ralph. “I’m still trying to put together how fucked up my life has become in the last, what, six hours?” She groaned as she pressed her face into her palms. “Why me?! Why does it feel like as soon as everything in my life is about to come together it all blows up in my face? How am I going to do this? Any of it?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Just take it one day at a time. You'll figure it out, most do, eventually.” He shrugged</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, very helpful! WOW! That really solved all my problems!” She bit back sarcastically “My mother sure didn’t figure it the fuck out.” she scoffed under her breath. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha, you're not your mother. Far from it!” Ralph scolded her</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That doesn’t mean I’m not going to fuck him up just as bad! I have no clue what I’m doing!” She let out a frustrated sigh.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He chuckled to himself. “You might be surprised by this but I don’t think anyone does. Everyone’s out here just kind of winging it.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She rolled her eyes at that thought. “You may be over-generalizing based on your own personal experiences.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ok, I’ll admit, winging it may be my specialty, but you should know better than anyone that life throws you curveballs.” He offered pointedly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’d say this is a bit more than a curveball.” She bit back</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So, the timing and circumstances aren’t </span>
<em>
<span>ideal</span>
</em>
<span> per-se, but I know you. I know how long you’ve wanted this.” he urged.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I did, I do! It’s just…” she struggled to explain.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Just what?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I never expected it to go like this! When we first talked about doing this…I don’t know…I think a large part of me was just trying to get back what I had when Wanda was here.” She felt an ache in her heart at the admission. “With her I felt like I finally had a family, I had someone I loved who truly loved me back. The child I lost then was just an expansion of that love.” She admitted, feeling the weight of that truth sink deep into her bones. “When we tried again and it didn’t work I was disappointed but not surprised. I don’t think my heart was really in it. I don’t know why I kept trying or why I even tried for so long? I think I was just holding onto that hope, maybe I could feel that way again one day.” Her eyes strained as they tried to shed tears that would no longer come. “And then, I never expected I’d find Rio. The way she made me feel…like life was worth living again. That I was worth loving.” She ghosted a smile before letting out a shuddering sigh. “After today, I don’t know…it feels broken. I don’t know how to trust her, or myself at this point. This is all so utterly fucked! I feel like I’ve lost the love I never thought could be possible over the child I’ve always wanted but had accepted I’d never have.” She looked back to Ralph as if pleading for some relief. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That doesn’t have to be the case, Agatha. You haven’t lost anything. Not unless you want to.” He shrugged seeing the conflict in her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I just keep thinking about how furious I am at her, at how everything was handled. She couldn’t just talk to me. She had to go hunt you three down to figure out how to tell me. It feels like she hid everything from me, she was practically lying to my face. And that’s not even mentioning HOW she found out. I don’t even know where to begin with that!” She slumped against the back of the couch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Completely fair, though, you have to admit this is a pretty unique situation you’ve found yourselves in.” He reminded her cautiously. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Exactly! Which makes everything more difficult. I’m mad at her but I can’t fault her completely, look at me! I’m fucking pregnant and had no idea. If she hadn’t said anything, who knows how long it would have taken me to realize? Clearly it wasn’t even on my radar even with all the symptoms I was experiencing. This is all my fault! I’m the one who put us in this position in the first place. Unknowingly, but still.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Come on, you can’t look at it like that!” He urged.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But it’s true! I fucked my life up bad enough that we both torpedoed this relationship. It was probably doomed from the start. Now the idea of being a single parent is crushingly real and I don’t know if I can do it. How can I? I’m already failing him!” She whimpered as her lip quivered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, honey! You’re not failing him! You didn’t know!” He reached over, taking her hands in his. “Do you remember what I said to you when I agreed to do this?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She let out a soft chuckle, “Do you?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He shrugged, “Most of it, no, but I remember this because I meant it. </span>
<em>
<span>You </span>
</em>
<span>are going to be an </span>
<em>
<span>amazing </span>
</em>
<span>mother!” He squeezed her hands in reassurance as a smile broke out across his face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You really think so?” she hummed doubtfully.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh I know so! You are brilliant, resilient, and you are going to love the shit out of that kid! And he has an uncle and a couple aunts that are going to spoil him silly. You’re not alone.” He moved closer, throwing his arms around her shoulders. “Give yourself time. Focus on yourself, and the little guy. If you decide Rio is important enough to include in that life then I’m sure you two will find a way to make things work.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She sighed, releasing the tension thinking about Rio had brought, even if it was only temporary. “Ugh, you’re right I have enough on my plate right now.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Speaking of plates, did you ever eat dinner?” Ralph asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, there was so much going on, I couldn’t even think about being hungry.” She admitted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright, then I’m fixing you something to eat. Anything you’re craving?”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Now that you mention it I could eat an Everest sized mountain of pasta.” She snorted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Done!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Ralph prepared the largest bowl of pasta he could as they sat and thought about all the change that was in store. There was no talk of the fear, drama, or uncertainty that still lay ahead. Instead they pondered which features the baby might inherit. Ralph threw out some potential names, all of which Agatha shot down immediately. They scanned the list Jen had sent, seeing a few items had already been marked off. By the time she was finished and ready to turn in for the night they had even figured out what color to paint Ralph’s room. As she wound down she even let herself dream, if just for tonight, of all the good things to come. Tiny hands wrapped around her fingers, first steps and first words, little laughs and big messes. Things she had waited years for and now were just below her fingertips as she settled her hand on the swell of her stomach and drifted off to sleep. </span>

<p>
<span>The next morning she awoke in a haze. The world around her moved in its ever familiar cycles, the sun still rose, its light peeking through the curtains. Scratchy still woke her with his insistent kneading demanding his breakfast. Yet, as consciousness washed over her, she was all too aware of the life altering shift of the day before. She pulled herself from beneath the cocoon of blankets and rested on the edge of her bed feeling exhaustion and an aching heaviness settle in her body. She glanced down at her stomach, the oversized t-shirt she slept in draped down, hiding any indication of the discovery the day before. She guided her hand beneath the hem to rest on the small swell she half expected not to be there. She felt a flutter dance beneath where she rested her hand. </span>
<em>
<span>It was real. </span>
</em>
<span>She could feel a cold rush of fear pour down her spine. She quickly rose from the bed, rushing into her bathroom and flipping on the light. She drew her shirt up, examining herself closely in the mirror. As she turned to the side her heart stuttered and she breathed out a soft whimper. Staring at her figure in the mirror she struggled to reconcile the image before her. She was looking at the same form she had always lived with but it was as if only now was she seeing the marks of her condition. The heaviness in her breast, the swell of her feet, the slight protrusion beneath her navel that only the day before had she thought might be a gluten intolerance. But now, as the flutter hummed just beneath her fingertips, it was a crushing reminder of the reality she now lived in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She looked up into her own eyes, catching worry and fear pooling at the corners. Before she could spiral further into self-loathing she dropped her shirt and brushed away the wetness from her eyes. She couldn’t afford to dwell on the pain and regret now tightening around her heart. She had to bury it deep before she was crushed under the weight of her grief of what was lost and what was yet to come. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As she removed her clothes and tied up her hair she turned on the shower as cold as it could get. Agatha thrust herself under the water hoping the shock would bring her back into this body that now felt so foreign. As the icy water cascaded down it began to settle the panic that had taken root in her chest, though it did nothing to help her feel at home in herself again. Instead she was awash with a dull numbness like the shell of the person she was the day before. Her body continued to move about getting ready as if on autopilot, motioning through the beats of her morning routine. She ran her fingers through her damp hair as she squeezed into a pair of maroon wide leg trousers and a black turtleneck top. She threw on a matching blazer, and took one final look at the stranger in the mirror before heading into the kitchen. As she rounded the corner she caught sight of Ralph, surprisingly awake, and cooking something on the stove as he danced around jovially, oblivious to her arrival. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She sidled up next to him, grabbing the loaf of bread and stuffing a piece in the toaster. Ralph leaned over with a smirk, immediately popping the bread right back out. “I don’t think coffee and a piece of toast is gonna cut it anymore. Go sit down.” He gestured to the island. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha scrunched her eyebrows as a smile tugged at the corner of her lips. She thought for a moment of defiantly resetting the toaster but couldn’t find the energy to summon her usual attitude and instead obliged the order. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So, how we feeling?” Ralph questioned as he fumbled with what looked like an omelette. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fine.” Agatha croaked not intending to engage in further conversation. She had no desire to sift through the maelstrom of emotions threatening to drown her before facing what would likely be a difficult day. Ralph abandoned the food on the stove to set a mug in front of her. She looked down into the nearly translucent contents and frowned, “This is not coffee, what is this?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ginger tea. It should help with your stomach.” He explained as he slid her a bowl of fruit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Where did this come from? I don’t remember having any of this.” She asked as she took a disappointed sip of the tea. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh…yeah…um, Rio and I stopped at the store on the way home. ” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha felt a jolt of fear rush through her at the mention of Rio, like lemon juice dripping into a fresh cut. “How thoughtful” she offered, doing her best to sound uninterested. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Honestly I’m glad she suggested it, we had like no food in the house. I was completely out of my protein bars. She helped me pick out a bunch of food and vitamins and shit for you and the baby.” Ralph prattled as if talking about the weather. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh really?” Agatha replied, fighting to bury the thoughts of Rio in the corners of her mind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, and she made sure I knew what things to avoid, obviously no more drinking, limit your caffeine intake, something about soft cheeses and deli meats. Oh she shut me down for tinned fish night! Said it probably wasn’t a good idea now with the baby.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh darn! Not the tinned fish night!” She let a breath of a laugh slip, amused at the small victory as she took a bite of the fruit.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Listen, you don’t know what you’re missing!” He said as he sat down the plate in front of her. “Bon appetit!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She glanced down at the reasonably edible looking omelette before glaring back at Ralph suspiciously “Why?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why what?” Ralph asked in complete confusion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why did you do this? Why are you even up right now?” She asked, irked by his convivial nature, as if oblivious to the fact that her life had shattered before her once again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>His face dropped but he didn’t release his amiable demeanor. “Honey, please, yesterday was…a lot, I wasn’t going to let you walk out of here and head to work without checking in. And I figured, since I knocked you up, I could start pulling my weight around here, make sure you and Clyde are taken care of.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She nearly choked on the bite of fruit she had taken. “First off, gross, don’t go around telling people you </span>
<em>
<span>knocked me up</span>
</em>
<span>! And Second, I’m not naming the baby Clyde!” She spat, bubbling with irritation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Damn, really? I thought I might have had something there.” He winked and gave her a sarcastic smile which managed to pull a laugh from her lungs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p><span>“Absolutely not!”</span> <span>She stared down at the meal for a moment before reluctantly taking a bite. Though she wasn’t hungry she knew Ralph was right, she didn’t really have a choice. </span></p><p> </p><p>
<span>Ralph stood at the end of the island, taking a few bites of his breakfast before asking, “So are you going to tell me how you’re really doing, or are you going to make me guess?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She let out a heavy sigh, annoyed at the question. “What do you want me to say? It feels like everything’s gone to shit but it’s not like I can do anything about it. I’m just going to try to get through today.” She groaned as she forced herself to eat another bite of the eggs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That great huh. You sure you want to go in today?” Ralph cringed, eyeing her concernedly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What? So I can sit around here wallowing in self pity at my own stupidity instead?” Agatha half shouted as she threw down her fork. “No thank you. I need to at least pretend like my life isn’t completely falling apart so I don’t launch myself over the nearest bridge. Besides, I need to figure out maternity leave, and who’s going to cover me, and decide how and when I’m going to tell people.” Her mind raced at the growing list of things she would have to deal with and figure out before the baby arrived. She felt a shiver run down her spine at that thought; the baby’s arrival, her baby’s arrival. “And it all just feels like I’m living in some weird nightmare that I can’t wake up from.” her voice broke as she uttered the last statement. She swallowed hard, forcing the flurry of emotions to settle deep within her as she returned to her food.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“None of that stuff has to happen today, if you’re not ready.” He reminded her, comfortingly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She shook her head as she speared another bite of egg. “What, and wait until I’m the size of a beached whale? I think they’re going to figure it out sooner rather than later. At the very least I need to set up a meeting with HR, get some semblance of a plan together so I don’t feel like I’m going at this blind.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I mean, go for it, if you think it’ll help. Just try not to stress yourself out about it. Rio mentioned stress is also bad for the baby.” He explained in earnest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She glared at him for being so insensible, “No shit, I’ll try to keep that in mind.” She stood from the stool having finished the last of her eggs, and straightened out her clothes. “Do I look as wrecked as I feel?” She asked, turning for him to get a glimpse of the full outfit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He hummed, contemplating his analysis. “It’s giving, I may be dead inside but I can still pull it together on the outside. You look fabulous.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thanks for the endorsement.” She huffed, rolling her eyes as she picked up her work bag. “Well, wish me luck I guess.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good luck, mama! You got this!” Ralph called after her as she headed out the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>————————————————</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As she walked through the doors of Music Hall her heart was nearly beating out of her chest with anxiety. She did her best to hide this distress with a mask of confidence and determination. It’s not that she was afraid to talk with HR, or for anyone at work to find out, but the moment they did it made everything that more real. She took a breath as she headed through the lobby, trying to calm herself as she felt a flutter just behind her belly button. As she crossed to the administrative corridor she caught Sharon flittering down the hallway in a panic.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jeeze! Mrs. Hart! What’s the rush?” Agatha asked as she stopped her in her path. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s Freddy, I haven’t had a chance to sit down since I got in. He’s got me running out to get the programs he had me reprint for tomorrow. He convinced the art department to redo the artwork on the front page, again.” She explained, clearly flustered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why? We got everything aligned yesterday. Besides, doesn’t he have an intern for that?” Agatha questioned dismissively. She had no patience for Freddy’s incompetence today. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Apparently she’s called in sick again so he asked me.” Sharon explained</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t bother, you’re not his assistant! If he wants it he can do it himself. Besides, I have something more important I need you to do.” She said as she started to lead her back down the hallway.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, right, you probably need a coffee before you head in there.” Sharon guessed as she turned to go fetch it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, actually, trying to cut back.” She said as she moved to block her exit. “Could you get me a copy of our company leave policies?” She asked as she turned Sharon around to lead her back towards her office. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Leave policies?” Sharon shouted back, to which a few heads turned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha flashed a dismissive half smile as she hurried them both down the hallway, “Yes, leave policies. Can you do that for me? Discreetly?” she asked in a hushed tone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well I’ll probably have to reach out to HR, I don’t have them on hand.” Sharon explained nervously, as Agatha guided them through the threshold of her office, closing the door behind them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s fine, while you’re at it can you set up a meeting for me to talk with them, as soon as possible?” Agatha requested, rounding her desk to sort through the papers strewn about there. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes.” Sharon replied, suspicious of the request but too intimidated to ask more about it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked over a few vendor contracts and the new program mockup Freddy had designed before glancing up to find Sharon still standing there, “Are you going to set up that meeting or is there something you need?” Agatha asked, as she sat down to check her email. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, yes actually, now that you mention it...” Sharon busseled out the door for a brief moment only to return carrying a handful of sticky notes. “The caterer asked to push back your meeting to 12, apparently they’re having issues with the oven?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Tell them we’ll keep it at the same time, we won’t be tasting anything today.” She answered, not looking up from her computer</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright, Dr. Jones wanted to see if there was any additional availability for tomorrow, he has some colleagues he would like to bring.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath caught in her throat at the request and her eyes launched to Sharon. “Did he specify how many? Or who they might be?” she asked, attempting to feign disinterest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I didn’t get any details.”  Sharon admitted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright, try and get a list of who he wants to bring and I’ll see what I can do.” She wasn’t sure if Rio would be on that list but she didn’t want to risk any further surprises at this point. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, and Herb asked to meet with you and Freddy this afternoon to start going over details for Mayfest.” she announced excitedly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck!</span>
</em>
<span> With everything else going on Agatha hadn’t even had Mayfest on her register. It was their month-long kick off to spring that drew in the largest crowds of their entire year. Though the key guests and performances had been agreed to months in advance they still had yet to secure several vendors and Herb was fixated on drawing in larger and larger crowds. It was already destined to be one of the most stressful times of her year, and now, she realized, it had the added benefit of being the month leading up to her due date. Agatha felt a fresh wave of nausea roll through her stomach, and swallowed hard. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What…what time is the meeting?” She asked as she fought to keep her breakfast. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m still trying to confirm with Freddy, but it looks like 3:00.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, this is the last thing she wanted to deal with today. “Is there any chance of convincing him to push it out?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well you know he’s leaving for Prague with Mr. Kaplan on Sunday, he’ll be there for about two weeks. Then he’s going out to visit his mother for a week. He was worried if you waited until he got back you all would be behind.” Sharon explained</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha closed her eyes, frowning in frustration, “And he couldn’t have figured this out sooner?” Sharon shrugged in apology. Agatha’s heart sank as she realized she would need to tell Herb the news before he left, whether or not she was ready to do so. Given his inconveniently timed hiatus and the demands of Mayfest, she also couldn’t afford to wait. “Fine, just see if you can get me some time with him too, either before or after.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Absolutely.” Sharon replied. “You sure I can’t get you a coffee or something?” She offered, seeing Agatha’s exhausted frustration.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha started to deny her offer but another wave of nausea rolled through her stomach. “Actually, can you find me some ginger tea? Or peppermint or something?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sure thing, you alright dear?” Sharon asked, seeing her discomfort. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m fine.” Agatha insisted curtly before returning to her work. Sharon nodded skeptically as she headed for the door, only to be pushed back into the room by Freddy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey Sharon! Glad I caught you! Did you get those programs yet?” He asked as he turned and winked at Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She grimaced as she drew back repulsed by the gesture. “Hey! She’s not your personal gopher.” Agatha barked at him. “What are you doing here Freddy?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well I thought I’d stop by to see if you’d had a chance to check out the new programs?” He asked with a gleeful grin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes as she waved Sharon off to complete her tasks. “New programs my ass, I’d take a second look at these if I were you. They appear to be missing information.” She scolded</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is that so?” Freddy laughed as he crossed his arms smugly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’d say omitting our key sponsors from the cover page is a pretty big miss for a donor preview don’t you think?” She scolded</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Come on! You know it looks so much better without all their horrendous logos on the front.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did you even mention them in the program?” She asked, flipping through the mockup.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, they’re right there on the back cover.” He grabbed the book from her and flipped to the back page. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“First off, you’ve put them at the bottom of the back inside cover like an afterthought. Second, even </span>
<em>
<span>I</span>
</em>
<span> would need a magnifying glass to decipher who they are. These people didn’t give us hundreds of thousands of dollars to be squeezed into the margins at the back. They want their names and businesses prominently displayed so they can give the impression they care about the arts. You want that full time social media manager? Get your head out of your ass and give them the recognition they paid for. Did you even attempt to get Herb’s approval?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m still waiting on his input.” He admitted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed a laugh at his thoughtlessness. “Yet you had </span>
<em>
<span>my</span>
</em>
<span> assistant running out like the building was on fire to get these disasters printed.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Disasters? We’ll see what Herb has to say.” He retorted defensively</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Even if you got these monstrosities approved, you’re not using Sharon to play fetch for you. You have an intern for that.” she goaded knowing the girl was out of commission.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Phoebe is out sick so I asked Sharon, I didn’t think it would be a big deal.” he reasoned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned back in her chair, pleased that he took the bait. “Out sick again?” She gave him a mocking pouty face. “That’s the third day this week. Wasn’t she out a few days last week as well? Is she really sick or are you two having a domestic dispute?” She leaned back in her chair with a wicked grin. If there was anything that was going to make her feel an ounce better it was torturing Freddy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Freddy’s face glowed bright red with anger and embarrassment. “She’s sick, she has the stomach flu or something.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“For two weeks in a row?” Agatha couldn’t help but laugh incredulously, “That seems…unlikely.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Listen, I don’t think it’s any of your business if my intern is out sick.” he spat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It is when you try and replace her with my assistant!” Agatha chided just as Sharon returned with her tea. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sorry, don’t mean to disturb” Sharon apologized as she handed the mug to Agatha. “I did want to let you know, Herb is able to meet with you after the Mayfest meeting and Janet from HR says she has some time at 2:30 today if that works.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, that’ll be fine.” Agatha replied as she took a sip of the tea and waved Sharon out again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“HR? Why are you meeting with HR?” Freddy asked as the door closed behind Sharon.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wouldn’t you like to know!” She replied with a devilish grin. “I’m sure you’ll find out soon enough. I have a meeting to get to.” She grabbed her mug and her computer and breezed past him as his eyes bulged in panic. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The unbridled joy she had at seeing the horror on his face had distracted her enough from her own situation that she was able to focus easier in her following meetings. She met with finance in a tedious review of the budget and anticipated expenditures before heading off to meet with building management. They walked through the space they planned to use for rehearsal the next day, reviewing set up and the anticipated changes needed for Dr. Jones’s additional guests. By the time they wrapped her feet and back had started to ache and she was glad to head off to her meeting with the caterer. She was hoping that since they had foregone the tasting it would be a quick discussion and she could head off to lunch as she was starting to grow hungry again. Unfortunately the issues with the oven turned out to be more of a hindrance than they had anticipated and they worked through the entire hour discussing alternatives should they not be able to make the repairs in time. As they neared the end of their time together she could feel her stomach beginning to grumble with hunger. This was soon joined by an excited flutter as the minutes ticked nearer and nearer to lunch. She checked the time on her phone, now regretting the fact that they didn’t have something to sample, and was greeted with a call from Sharon. </span>
</p><p>
<span> “Yes?” She answered, abruptly cutting off the caterer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Hello dear, your friend is here with lunch again. I have her waiting in your office. I thought I should let you know after last time.” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart was in her throat, </span>
<em>
<span>Rio</span>
</em>
<span> was here? After yesterday? After everything? She felt a flash of anxiety pulse throughout her body. She couldn’t tell if she was furious or relieved. “Tell her I’ll be up in a minute.” She decided as she quickly hung up the phone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Everything ok?” The caterer asked as Agatha began to collect her things.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes…we uh…we’re gonna have to wrap this up, unfortunately. Keep me updated on the repairs, but at this point I couldn’t care less as long as there’s something to eat.” She flashed an unconvincing smile as she rushed past them and out the doors before they could even respond.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She stormed through the entryway toward the elevator as her heart pounded in her ears. Her thoughts boomeranged wildly trying to speedrun the emotional obstacle course she had just been thrown into. </span>
<em>
<span>What the hell is she doing here? Who does she think she is? To just show up now, what could she possibly have to say? </span>
</em>
<span>She was furious at the audacity of this woman. At how she had known and not said anything. At how she had gone behind her back to talk to her friends. The pain she had caused her and all the worry and anxiety leading up to it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She pressed the button for the elevator, her chest tightening as her breathing came in shallow bursts, her mind recalling memories of the night before. Rio’s honey amber eyes heavy with sorrow and fear as she begged Agatha for understanding despite the earth shattering news she had shared. The numb hollowness that consumed her as Jen and Alice drove her to the hospital. The dread and horror and guilt she felt hearing the baby’s heartbeat echo throughout the room. She bit her lip, fighting to stave off the tears collecting in the corners of her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Soon the elevator doors dinged and she quickly stepped inside, pressing the button for her floor before leaning back against the wall. She struggled to stifle the eruption of emotion that was threatening to break free from the well deep within her. Yet she knew if she didn’t pull herself together soon she wouldn’t be able to contain the avalanche of devastation that riled below the surface. She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, trying to regain her composure. </span>
<em>
<span>Why? Why did she have to do this now? Why did she have to show up and press her fingers into such a fresh wound?</span>
</em>
<span> As Agatha continued to breathe slowly, attempting to calm the storm inside her, she felt a flutter dance just beneath her skin. She glanced down, eyes wide with trepidation, for the baby, for Rio, for her future and all that was yet to come. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As the elevator announced its arrival she straightened herself up and brushed away the few stray tears that had fallen. She rolled her shoulders back and fixed her face with determination: she would not let whatever lay ahead get the best of her. She sauntered out and down the hallway, breezing by Sharon’s desk as she blasted through her office door, hoping to catch Rio by surprise. Instead she scared the shit out of Jen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha! What the fuck?!” Jen shrieked as she jumped up from the couch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stumbled back a bit, surprised and confused. “Jen?! What are you doing here?” She screeched in shock.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I'm a good friend who brought you a burrito!” Jen shouted back defensively as she pointed to the food on Agatha’s desk. “What’s your problem?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes as she took a step out of her office. “Sharon!” She shouted as the woman bounced out of her seat to answer the call. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes dear? Is everything alright?” Sharon asked nervously, having heard the exchange. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sharon, this is Jen. Jen, Sharon.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nice to meet you dear.” Sharon smiled and waved</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh we’ve met, a few times actually.” Jen nodded, a little irritated. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good, now that we know each other, in the future can you specify which friend it is that’s dropped by?” Agatha requested pointedly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Who did you think I was?” Jen asked, eyebrows stitched in amusedly as a smirk tugged at the corner of her mouth. Agatha glared at Jen as she started to direct Sharon back out the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, sorry dear! Did you think it was that dark haired lady? What’s her name? Reba?” Sharon managed to ask on her way out. Jen chuckled as she rolled her eyes and plopped back onto the couch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thank you Sharon that will be all!” Agatha huffed as she closed the door in Sharon’s face and headed straight for the food on her desk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re welcome for lunch by the way!” Jen chided</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did you and Ralph sign up for shifts or something?” she asked, taking a bite of the burrito.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What are you talking about?” Jen asked, scowling at Agatha as she took a bite of her own food. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ralph made breakfast this morning, you brought lunch. Is Alice covering dinner?” Agatha half-joked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not that I’m aware of.” Jen rolled her eyes unamused. “Sorry if we’re a little worried about you.” she snapped facetiously</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m fine.” Agatha stated plainly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Riiiight…the way you came in here at a ten screams, </span>
<em>
<span>I’m handling all of this really well</span>
</em>
<span>.” Jen chided</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Obviously I was under the impression I was walking into a completely different situation.” Agatha bit back</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No shit! Did you really expected Rio to randomly show up with lunch after last night? You technically broke up with her.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha took another bite as she felt a twinge of regret prick at the back of her mind. She was angry at Rio, furious even, yet something in her soul still felt tied to this woman. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Have you heard from her?” Jen asked, eyebrows raised.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No. Though apparently she took Ralph to the store after they left the hospital to buy a bunch of food and shit. Not really sure what that means.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It was thoughtful at least.” Jen nodded approvingly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sure, it was literally the least they could do after…everything.” Agatha took another bite of the burrito and sat back in her chair, letting her hand rest on the slight swell of her stomach. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How are you feeling?” Jen asked, noticing the gesture. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why does everybody ask me that?” Agatha sighed, exasperated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well considering you </span>
<em>
<span>just </span>
</em>
<span>found out you’re well into growing a human I think it’s a logical question.” Jen reasoned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Physically, I feel as awful as I usually do, at least now I know why.” she grumbled</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Have you told anyone?” Jen inquired</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not yet, I’m meeting with HR this afternoon then I’m planning to tell Herb after our Mayfest meeting.” She explained</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mayfest? Is that the festival thing you do every year?” Jen asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What does it sound like?” Agatha replied condiscendingly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Really? You’re gonna be like that, after I brought you food?” Jen sassed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes and huffed, “Yes it’s that festival thing.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You sure you wanna do that this year?” Jen questioned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Please, they can’t afford for me not to! That would leave tweedle-dee and tweedle-dum in charge of running the most profitable month of our season. Absolutely not!” She chuckled </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You do know you’re going to be </span>
<em>
<span>exceedingly </span>
</em>
<span>pregnant by May, right?” Jen scolded</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That had occurred to me, yes.” She retorted matter-of-factly. Jen raised her eyebrows in judgement as she took another bite of food which helped her to hold her tongue. “Although it sounds miserable, I’ll just have to make it work.” Agatha reasoned seeing Jen’s restraint. </span>
</p><p> </p><p><span>“Girl, you might not have</span> <span>a choice! You’ve been lucky enough as it is considering everything. You have to be careful to not overdo it! You’re not the only one who’s gonna suffer now if you push yourself too hard.” Jen reprimanded. </span></p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha gritted her teeth as Jen’s words sunk in. It felt like a low blow but she felt the stink of the harsh truth. That didn’t make it any easier to take. “I’m well aware of that fact, Jennifer.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Just then Freddy burst through her door erratically. “Your meeting with HR.” He gasped, a little distressed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck, is everyone like this here?” Jen gasped as Agatha sat there calmly annoyed at the intrusion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What of it?” Agatha snapped.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is this about last week?” He asked, eyes a fury of panic and determination.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You mean when you touched me and I nearly broke your hand for doing so?” Agatha reminded him, eyebrows raised.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The fuck?” Jen huffed under her breath.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, that’s what I’m referring to! It was a pat on the back, I wasn’t being malicious and you know it! You know I can file a counter complaint for what you did to my hand! ” He warned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’ve really been stewing about that haven’t you!” She grumbled. “Believe it or not, it’s not about that.” She waved dismissively.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh” he breathed as his face fell. “It’s…it’s not…this isn’t about Phoebe is it? Agatha…I swear…it’s not…” He trailed off, only now noticing Jen’s presence.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“By all means don’t stop on her account! What were you saying about your relationship with the intern? I’ll need to add it to my notes.” She said, pulling out a notebook. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>His head snapped back to her in alarm. “You wouldn’t.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Try me!” She grinned maliciously </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Freddy swallowed hard as the color drained from his face. “I…uh…I have some work to catch up on. Excuse me.” He quickly retreated out of the room slamming the door behind him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha took another bite of the burrito Jen brought her smiling contentedly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What the hell was that about?” Jen asked in disgusted confusion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Freddy, he’s a thorn in my side but I love to make him sweat. He thinks I’m going to tell HR about the affair he’s been having with his intern. Which I will, at some point, because that’s what he gets for nosing in my business. He’s just lucky I have enough shit going on in my own life that his indiscretions are low on my list of priorities.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re gonna give that man a stroke.” Jen chuckled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Only if I’m lucky!” Agatha laughed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, I have to head into the hospital.” Jen said as she stood and gathered her things. “Please think about what I said, and let me know how everything goes this afternoon.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes. Goodbye Jen!” Agatha groaned like a petulant teenager as she waved Jen out.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Now alone in the thick silence of her office her mind buzzed. Despite her dismissiveness, Agatha was reeling from the warnings Jen had placed. It had brought everything into focus as she began to prepare for her meetings with Herb and HR. She spent time reviewing the dismal leave policy Sharon had delivered as well as scanning the upcoming calendar to get an idea of any further potential hurdles between now and her delivery. As she noted that upcoming deadline in her calendar a pit began to grow in her stomach. There really wasn’t that much time, even if she managed to make it all the way to her due date. Seeing it now on screen she bit the inside of her cheek, once again swallowing the fact that Jen had been right, Mayfest might not be on the table this year. At least, not at the capacity she was used to and the idea of Freddy and Herb managing on their own had her lunch threatening to crawl back up her throat. Which left the question of who would pick up the slack? For now she added it to the list of things to cover when she talked with Herb. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Not long before her meeting with HR Sharon knocked on her door, entering cautiously. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes?” Agatha asked, not looking away from her computer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I have that list of people from Dr. Jones for tomorrow.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes snapped to Sharon as she threw her hand out. Sharon rushed forward handing over the note. Agatha hurriedly threw on her glasses as her heart began to race. She scanned the list not seeing Rio’s name among the few and was surprised to find a pang of disappointment settle in her chest. She cleared her throat as she directed her attention back to Sharon, “Let him know we’ll be able to accommodate all of them.” She uttered monotonously. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Will do. Is there anything else you need, honey?” Sharon replied, visibly concerned. As she pondered the woman before her a thought sprang to mind, if there was anyone in the office equipped to help her manage through the chaos of what would be the next few months it would be Sharon. She was always there when Agatha needed her, brought her anything she asked for, and had heard her rant, more times than she could count, about the imbeciles surrounding them. Hell, she had been more motherly to her than her own mother. It would only make sense to clue her in to what was in store.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, actually. Sharon, please have a seat.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sharon froze, eyes wide with fear, “Uh oh, what’s wrong. You only call me Sharon when there’s something wrong.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha rolled her eyes, “There’s nothing wrong, just</span> <span>have a seat.” She offered calmly as she gestured to a chair in front of her. Sharon timidly inched forward and eased into the seat. </span></p><p>
<span>“There's something I should tell you. I just ask, that for right now, you keep it between us, alright?” Sharon nodded cautiously, unsure of what to expect. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m planning to take some time off this summer. A few months at least, hopefully not until June.” A rush of butterflies filled her stomach as she realized this would be the first time she would be telling anyone. She bit her lip as she built up the courage to reveal her condition. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m pregnant.” As the words fell they felt foreign on her lips and settled heavy over her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After a moment Sharon’s eyes grew wide in shock as the news settled. She looked her up and down with her mouth agape before gasping, “Oh my God! You’re kidding!” Her eyebrows raised in shock as her eyes misted with happiness. “You’re going to have a baby?!” She shrieked, more overjoyed than Agatha had expected. She closed her eyes and pursed her lips at the exuberance, almost regretting the admission. Why had she decided on a whim to make her the first person she told? </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, isn’t that what I just said.” Agatha grumbled harshly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh my goodness! Well, Congratulations! AHA-ha-ha! Isn’t this just the best news I’ve heard all year! Oh, honey, how exciting for you! A little baby!” she cooed as a tear leaked from her eye.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha wrinkled her nose in judgement, “Are you crying?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sorry dear, I’m just so happy for you!” Sharon sniffled, wiping the tear from her eye. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well that makes one of us.” Agatha huffed under her breath. “Look, I’m only telling you this because I may need your help getting everything in order between now and then, particularly with Mayfest preparation. I don’t know what Herb is planning nor what kind of condition I’ll be in at that point but you and I both know Herb and Freddy cannot manage this project on their own.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh no, that would be a disaster!  Of course, I’d be more than happy to help, whatever you need.” Sharon reassured.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Excellent. Why don’t you join us for Herb’s meeting at 3 so you’re on board from the beginning. I’ll make him aware of our agreement when I meet with him after. Alright? That’ll be all.” Agatha said, returning to her computer as she dismissed Sharon. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, how exciting! A little baby!” Sharon buzzed as she headed for the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Just remember, between us for now.” She called out warning Sharon as she opened the door to leave. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh of course, dear, your secret’s safe with me!” She promised as she left, closing the door behind her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Secret? I love a secret!” Freddy taunted as he turned around in Sharon’s chair peeling an orange. “Is it a good one?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s none of your beeswax Mr. Burton.” Sharon chided as she shooed him away from her chair. “Is there something I can help you with?” Sharon asked pleasantly enough, as Freddy moved to lean on her desk. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, I’m fine, thank you.” He said, eating a slice of the fruit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Perhaps you’d like to eat that elsewhere then.” Sharon suggested politely annoyed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh no I think I’ll stick around. Make myself available while she chats with HR. I’m not going to let her make baseless accusations about me and not stick up for myself.” her groused</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’d be wasting your time.” Sharon warned, in a sing-songy voice as she side eyed him while filing away paperwork. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Freddy frowned amusedly as he swallowed another piece of orange. “You seem quite sure about that.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The meeting has nothing to do with you.” She chuckled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh is that so? And I’m guessing you might know what it </span>
<em>
<span>is </span>
</em>
<span>about then?” He prodded intrusively.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sharon pursed her lips and turned away from him, deflecting the question. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“AH! You do!” He gasped as he leaned into her line of sight “Any chance it has something to do with this secret you’re keeping safe?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Sharon turned her chair away from him once again,  pretending to look into her purse as she avoided his inquiries. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Interesting” he smiled maliciously</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mr. Burton, if you have no further business here I’d ask that you please leave my desk, unlike you I have quite a bit of work to do.” She said, smiling condescendingly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>He scoffed as he threw his orange peel in her trash can. “Fine by me. My plans have changed as it is. See you soon.” He said with a smirk though it felt like a vague threat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>————————————————</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s meeting with Janet from HR went as well as to be expected. She outlined the information Agatha had already read in the policy but was able to give her some options should she need to extend past the meger ten week maternity leave. Janet handed over paperwork and was even able to give her a few insights about their insurance policy that she hadn’t been aware of. In the end it would all depend on what she could work out with Herb. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are there any other questions you have for me?” Janet asked as she gathered her things. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, this was very insightful. I appreciate your time.” Agatha replied as she rose to usher her out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just keep me in the loop if anything changes, before or after.” Janet asked as they headed into the hallway. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ah, Janet! So glad I caught you!” Freddy hollered as he barreled towards them down the hallway. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’ve got to be kidding me.” Agatha groaned under her breath. “What are you doing here?” She spat at him</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m here to see when Janet would have some time for her and I to have a discussion on the same topic you two were just discussing. Since I’m heavily involved, right?” He replied gleefully as Agatha glared at him in disgust</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, I didn’t realize you two were </span>
<em>
<span>involved</span>
</em>
<span> in that way.” Janet frowned, “We may need some additional disclosure forms. Are you the father?” Janet asked, oblivious to what she had just revealed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Absolutely NOT!” Agatha shouted just as Freddy, in utter shock, gasped “Father!?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rounded on him as he looked on in horror at her rage, “If you must know, I’m fucking pregnant you asshole! I was meeting with her to discuss my maternity leave. Not that it’s any of your fucking business!” She bellowed “I didn’t mention anything about your </span>
<em>
<span>relationship </span>
</em>
<span>with the intern but since you’re so fucking insistent I’m sure she’d love to hear all about it!” She snapped before turning to Sharon. “Come on, we’re going to be late for Herb’s meeting.” She stormed off down the hallway towards Herb’s office with Sharon closely in tow leaving Freddy and Janet alone in the aftermath. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After a brief moment of silence Janet piped up, as her head tilted to the side inquisitively. “What exactly did she mean by relationship with the intern?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>————————————————-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stormed into Herb’s office just as he was finishing a call. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thanks Garrett, I’ll catch up with you when I get back, I have to run to my next meeting.” He said as he immediately hung up the phone. “Agatha, Sharon, good to see you. Is everything alright?” He asked, seeing her dismay. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Everything’s fine!” Agatha grunted as she settled into her chair. “I’ve asked Sharon to sit in today, she’s going to be joining us for planning meetings this year. We’ll discuss the justification when we talk after this.” She explained as calmly as she could manage. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, alright, glad to have you!” Herb nodded in Sharon’s direction though his attention didn’t entirely leave Agatha. “Did you happen to see Freddy on your way over?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, unfortunately.” She replied just as Freddy burst through the doors. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sorry I’m late, Herb.” He gasped, nearly out of breath.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Surprised you made it at all.” Agatha grumbled under her breath as he settled into the seat next to her. “I thought you might have been held up with Janet.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh don’t worry, I have a meeting with her first thing Monday. No thanks to you.” He snapped</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No thanks to me?! You’re the one who couldn’t mind your own damn business!” She bit back</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You </span>
<em>
<span>implied</span>
</em>
<span> you were filing a complaint against me, as far as I knew it </span>
<em>
<span>was </span>
</em>
<span>my business!” He exclaimed, growing more irritated. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I didn’t imply shit, you assumed.” she responded, matching his energy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright, alright! Let’s get it together!” Herb demanded. “We have enough to get through today without you at each other's throats. Whatever is going on between you two you’ll have to sort through it later. And be sure that you do, we’re going to need all hands on deck if we’re going to pull off what I have in mind.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As they reluctantly settled, Herb laid out his plan for the upcoming festival. Along with the regular calendar of concerts and events he wanted to extend the festivities to outside the building. In collaboration with local artists, restaurants, and breweries, they would host a night market each weekend, Thursday through Saturday. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You do understand this is going to require an entire team to execute. We have nowhere near the amount of resources or people to manage something like this currently.” Agatha voiced sharply as her body hummed with tension at the thought of it all. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Which is why, thanks in large part to your efforts earlier this year, we are planning to hire a team of seasonal workers and contractors to help us manage.” Herb explained</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fantastic.” She muttered as a pit formed in her stomach thinking of the insurmountable task ahead. Why did she have to be so good at her job?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well I for one think this is absolutely brilliant! It’s exactly the kind of thing I can sink my marketing teeth into. Lots to showcase, if we can pull it off.” Freddy goaded, flashing a sideways glance at Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well good, there’s a lot to do!” Herb admitted. “I was pleasantly surprised to get the necessary permits and permissions from the city today, which is why I hurried to gather us before my trip. We are finally clear to move forward with our plans. I have a few companies I’ve been looking at working with. I’d like you two to review and select what’s needed while I’m out. I have a list of vendors to consider as well, Agatha I’d like you to review that. Freddy, I have the names of the artists we are looking to partner with if you’d get started on some promotional materials, keeping in mind the elemental theme we agreed upon.” Herb said as he handed each of them a folder. “I’d like to hit the ground running when I return so I’m counting on both of you.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No worries on my end! Agatha, you seem surprisingly quiet. Are you not excited about Herb’s plan?” Freddy asked tauntingly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thrilled.” She growled, glaring at him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Excellent! I know this is going to be an undertaking, it’s something we’ve talked about wanting to do for a few years, so now that we have the opportunity we can’t afford to take any half-measures, understand? Do either of you have any questions before we wrap this up?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, I’m good.” Freddy commented, “Agatha?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not at the moment, as long as you’re still good to chat after this?” She asked in a hushed tone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, of course! I have a few minutes. Freddy, I’ll catch you when I’m back. Sharon, good to see you, nice to have you for this project, it’s going to be a doozy but I think it’ll be a big hit!” Herb cheered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh definitely, sounds like a hoot! Aha-ha!” Sharon replied before turning to Agatha, “Is there anything else you need dear? Would you like me to stay until after your chat with Herb?” Sharon asked discreetly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, that’s alright, you head home. I’ll see you at 10 tomorrow.”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright honey!” She gave Agatha a caring smile and rested a hand on her shoulder as she leaned in, whispering “Good luck!” before following Freddy out the door.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bit her lip anxiously as Herb made his way to lean against his desk. “So, there’s something you wanted to talk about? Is everything alright? You and Freddy both seemed pretty upset when you got here.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She let out a nervous laugh, recalling their confrontation, “Yeah, Freddy doesn’t seem to know when to keep his mouth shut or mind his own business.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Though, I’m not surprised, it’s disappointing to hear. Is there anything I can do to help? You know we’ll be working closely together over the next few months, I want to make sure any issues are dealt with head on and resolved quickly.” Herb stated plainly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know I can’t stand that man.” Agatha grimaced.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I do. I also know how effective this team can be when you two are able to cooperate with each other.” Herb admitted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha glared at him, unamused. “It’s fine, I’ve already handled it.” She reliped as she started to pick at her fingers anxiously.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good, that’s what I like to hear. Is that what you were planning to talk with me about or is there something else?” Herb asked as he moved around to sit behind his desk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No…I um…there is something else we need to discuss.” She admitted as her body tingled with nervous energy and her stomach launched into her throat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Talk to me, what’s going on?” Herb asked calmly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well…” She laughed apprehensively “I have had some news recently, </span>
<em>
<span>very </span>
</em>
<span>recently.” She glanced down as a flutter hummed beneath her skin, as if aware of what she was about to reveal. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, is it something serious?” he asked, eyebrows stitched with concern. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You could say that.” She nodded while fidgeting in her seat, trying to find the right way to say it. “It may…well, it will likely impact my participation in Mayfest to some extent this year.” Herb’s face fell as he grew more distressed. “It looks like I’ll be about 8 months pregnant by the beginning of May.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Herb’s mouth gaped comically as his eyebrows raised further up his head, in shock, than she’d ever seen. “You’re pregnant?” He finally breathed, to which she nodded tentatively. Herb let out a surprised burst of laughter as a grin beamed across his face. “Seriously?” He asked, still stunned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Dead serious, unfortunately.” she cringed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I…wow…that’s…HA!...I wasn’t expecting that!” He admitted, still with a grin on his face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a chuckle at that. “You and me both!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wow! I mean, congratulations! That’s fantastic news!” Herb gushed, clearly excited for her. “You…uh…yeah I can see that making things a little more difficult this year. Huh.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She swallowed anxiously as she rushed to dissuade any concerns. “I, of course, am committed to doing all that I can, it’s just…I don’t know where I’m going to be at that point, with everything. Sharon is aware of the situation which is why I had her come today. She’s already agreed to help me manage my end, so between the two of us we should be able to handle what is required. I’m technically not due until June so I’m hoping not to be out until then. Though I do have a few appointments coming up. I’m already working to get everything organized in anticipation of my absence.” she rambled</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Herb raised his hand, quieting her explanations, before he commented calmly, “I have no doubts in your ability to accomplish what I’ve asked. I have kids, three of them. I am well aware of the position this puts you in. I am more than willing to accommodate whatever it is that you need to be successful in this. If that’s more time, more people, flexible work hours, we’ll make it happen. Thanks to you we can afford to!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She breathed a laugh of astonishment. She had expected Herb to be understanding, she had not expected him to bend over backwards to accommodate her. “Thank you Herb, I appreciate that.” was all she could manage to say as the relief of this support began to shift something inside her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Make no mistake, I know who actually gets things done around here. Freddy and I have the vision and the passion but you make it happen. You find the resources and people. You construct the plan of action and keep everyone in line, and always manage to go above and beyond what’s expected. We’re lucky to have you.” Herb praised.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sucked her upper lip between her teeth as she felt herself collapse from within at the recognition. Receiving compliments had always been difficult for her, as it was not something she experienced often, and an urgent rush of fear sparked within her. She gritted her teeth together in an awkward smile and abruptly stood, needing to escape. “Alrighty then! Well, this has been fun. I hope you have a nice trip. I guess I’ll see you in three weeks!”  She hurriedly gathered her things and started to head out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha.” Herb called as she neared the door. “Congratulations. Take care of yourself, ok?” She nodded to him as she closed the door behind her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She sped down the hallway, back to her office, and collapsed on the small couch. Only then did she let herself breathe a sigh of relief. It had gone well, remarkably well. The people she had told, save for Freddy, were supportive and genuinely happy for her. Work had fallen into place, yet where she craved relief from the security this provided, her heart only found the aching sorrow and guilt she had buried since that morning. A few tears quickly developed into a waterfall as she finally let herself feel the emotions she had been holding in. The disappointment and guilt she had for herself, the gratitude she had for Jen, and Sharon and Herb, the fury she had for Freddy, and the crushing grief and anger and aching longing she still had for Rio. All rushing in at once, consuming every fiber of her being. Her form shuddered as she worked through each wave of emotion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a while the sobs began to subside, leaving a hiccuping echo of grief, and she could feel her body finally settle around her. As she lay still in the silence of her office a gentle flutter danced beneath her skin. The child she had always wanted, had hoped for, had begged for, had grieved over, reminding her once again of his miraculous presence. She looked down and carefully placed a hand above the spot she had felt the motion. She rested there for a moment before the flutter echoed beneath her palm. She let out a heavy sigh as a small smile cracked the corners of her lips. In the empty aftermath of her sorrow this little flicker of light shone through the darkness. The spark of hope she had come so close to giving up on. She let her head fall back onto the couch savoring this peace, cradling the strumming life inside her. </span>

<p>
<span>Rio took a hard swallow as she opened the door to the restaurant, after all she was there to see Agatha. As she stepped through the threshold the vastness of the hall nearly swallowed her whole. She did her best to wade through the seemingly endless crowd of people filling the dusky space. Her gaze searched, table after table, person after person until she spotted her. Agatha, seated against the back wall, clad in a flowing navy blue dress, glowing ethereally as if a halo of light surrounded her. Her piercing blue eyes calling to Rio across the rows of people between them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lurched forward, heading directly toward her, though each step felt like moving through quicksand. As she drew closer Agatha’s crystal blue eyes grew ever more fierce, highlighted in a red tearyness, as if the wounds Rio had made were still fresh and raw. With each step closer she drew a new tear from Agatha’s eyes. Then, right when she was within striking distance of the table, Agatha rose, a storm of fury and grief, and moved to push past Rio, bumping into her along the way. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio spun around just in time to spot her moving quickly through the crowd. She rushed to follow, back through the sea of people, barely catching sight of Agatha as she sped to the door. Just as she was about to escape, Rio managed to reach out, catching her wrist. Agatha looked back sharply, gaze full of fear, and anger, and sorrow. Rio cried out, “</span>
<em>
<span>Agatha, please wait!” </span>
</em>
<span>Though the sound was muffled by the crowd. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared back at her, eyebrows stitched in confusion and pain but said nothing in response. Instead, she broke away from Rio’s grasp and rushed out the door and down the street. Rio felt a swell of pain and anguish and desperation as she pushed through the last of the crowd and out the door after Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the empty silent darkness of the world outside she saw Agatha rush across the street at the end of the block. Rio bolted, hurrying to catch up to her but it was as if Agatha was twice as fast. Rio stopped at the stairs that met her on the other side of the street as she saw Agatha slip through the front doors of what appeared to be Music Hall. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hurried up the steps after her and through the massive doors where she was met with a swarm of people milling about in evening wear. Some dancing, some chatting, some eating and drinking merrily as classical music lilted in the air around them. She eased into the multitude, once again searching for a glimpse of Agatha. As Rio reached the center of the entryway she caught sight of her in the threshold of the back hallway, face stitched in pain as she gripped the corner of the wall, her other arm wrapped protectively around her stomach. Rio surged forward as a new rush of fear pricked at her heart. As she worked to get through the partying horde she watched Agatha stumble down the hallway in distress. Despite her urgency, as she reached the corridor, Agatha was nowhere in sight. She stood for a moment staring down the dark passage before her, lit only by a single bulb of light at the far end. An eerie stillness settled in the space before her as the hallway seemed to stretch further and further away. The noise of the event behind her blurred into nothingness as she strained to listen for any sound of the woman she was searching for. </span>
</p><p>
<span>In the void a scream rang out, sharp, earth shattering. Rio sprinted down the hallway as wails continued to echo around her. Her legs moved as fast as they could but it still seemed like ages before she reached the end where she had to choose, left or right. She stood still, listening to the screams that had taken shape, calling out her name in desperation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Rio! Rio, please! Please, help!”</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>As she turned to the right towards the sound, a glow seemed to radiate from one of the doors down the dark hallway. She hurried forward to stand before the door, the cries growing ever more frantic as her hand shakily reached up to turn the knob. The handle clicked and she pushed the creaking door open to near silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There sprawled on the floor of an empty room was Agatha, sitting on her side with her knees curled around her, one hand splayed out on the floor in front of her, supporting her weight, the other wrapped around her swollen stomach. Her head had fallen forward as her body shook with sobs and labored breaths, her long hair draped down around her like a veil. Her dress was splayed out beneath her and appeared to be growing in size as Rio stepped forward into the room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha?” she called out, barely more than a whisper. Agatha didn’t say a word but all sounds she had been making immediately ceased. Rio continued to inch forward until her foot made contact with the hem of her dress. The sound it had made was wet and squelching. She glanced down to find instead of the dress, she was standing in an expanding pool of blood. In a rush of fear her gaze snapped back to lock with Agatha’s, her eyes now dark and sunken in, her skin pallid and waxy, making her blue irises ever more penetrating. With the last of the strength that she had, Agatha, through streaming bloody tears, begged, “</span>
<em>
<span>Rio, help me!</span>
</em>
<span>” before her body crumbled beneath her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio felt herself lurch forward as she screamed out “AGATHA!” her heart pounding in her chest. She looked into the darkness around her as sweat poured in cold droplets down her back. She shifted her legs under the covers to sit more comfortably as she dropped her head into her hands. She sat for a moment as she caught her breath, she couldn’t survive this much longer. It had been almost three weeks since the debacle in the Chili's parking lot and since then she had been plagued nightly by these worsening terrors.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>In the beginning her dreams were brief, just flashes in the few hours that she could find rest. It being her week off she couldn’t help but anxiously wait for any news about Agatha that she doubted would ever come. She had no idea where they stood. She had technically broken up with her, though it was because she was trying to beat Rio to the punch, she doubted if anything that had followed changed that fact. It left her with a crippling sense of guilt and fear that caused her to seclude herself in her apartment, lying awake into the early hours of the morning torturing herself for the great mistakes she had made and the pain she had caused. Her days were plagued with the awareness of what she had lost. It was suffocating and sharp, as if a piece of her soul had been ripped away. She spoke to no one except for the food delivery person, even blowing off messages from Nat and Yelena asking her if she was doing alright or needed anything. Instead she taunted herself with memories of their time together, thoughts of the child she likely would never meet, and the life they would never share. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The following week she had no choice but to gather herself enough to head back to work. Whenever she entered the hospital the smell of antiseptic and medical equipment helped ease her into a robotic numbness, going about her job devoid of emotion. Something she had honed in residency that made her the excellent surgeon she was, now her lifeline in the purgatory that had become her every day. Despite this rigid shell, fears continued to roam the corners of her mind, wondering how Agatha was, if she and the baby were alright. She hadn’t heard from Jen and didn’t dare reach out to Agatha in fear of causing more distress than she already had. At night she would return to her empty apartment, the quiet loneliness gnawing at her as she craved to reach out to her, but she knew she was in no place to sort through the mess between them. Repressing herself, though, had had terrible consequences as the dreams began to grow more intense and caused her to wake in the wee hours of the morning. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She had hoped that once her week at work was over and she had time to settle and refocus that the dreams would ease, but no such luck. If anything the dreams grew more vivid and more intense with each passing night and her waking hours were a battle to distract herself from the ever consuming thoughts of Agatha. She couldn’t remember ever being this distressed in any of her previous break ups. Even when she had broken off her engagement the pain had started to subside after the first week. With Agatha, even weeks later, she was still experiencing deep waves of grief that would seem to hit her out of nowhere and nearly crumble her to the point of hopelessness. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Now, it was Friday, she only had a few more days before she had to return to work again and she was reeling from the most horrific nightmare yet. As she sat there in the darkness her limbs tingled with the residual fear and panic of seeing Agatha’s limp, bloody form before her. As cold sweat streamed down her body she reached over to her nightstand and grabbed her phone to check the time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>4:44</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Later than she had been sleeping until but still horrendously early. With her heart still racing in her chest she knew, even if she tried, there was no way she would be able to fall back asleep. An ominous dread was settling in her body and would not let her rest further. She had been stuck with this worsening curse that was threatening to thrust her further into depression and now after nights of restless sleep she was starting to unravel at the seams. </span>
<em>
<span>Why was her mind doing this? Why was she there every time she closed her eyes? Was it not enough to deal with the real pain of losing her?  </span>
</em>
<span>She decided she needed to shake this panic loose from her body so she rolled out of bed, threw on a sweatshirt and sweatpants, and headed out for a run. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It was almost too cold for how few layers she had on, but the bite of the winter air filling her lungs burned in a way that felt like it was scratching an itch she hadn’t been able to reach. The emotional pain she had been dragging around night after night, day after day was finally matched by the sharp burning in her chest with each labored breath. The tingling fear was quickly replaced by a stinging numbness in her extremities. She ran listlessly for miles until she could barely feel her feet hitting the pavement beneath her and frozen tears pricked her eyes. Eventually she began to slow, finally taking in the world around her, and was disappointed to find herself in the middle of the park she and Agatha would take walks in. In the stunned absurdity of it all she found a laugh bubbling out of her mouth. Of course, even in her mindless distraction she had managed to drive herself to the center of many cherished memories. It seemed no matter what she did she was destined to be haunted by Agatha’s presence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She padded over to a patch of frosty grass and let herself collapse onto the earth, her lungs aching for oxygen. As her body stilled her shuddered breath broke into pieces as delirious tears began to flow like a river down the sides of her face. </span>
<em>
<span>Would she ever be free of this sorrow? </span>
</em>
<span>She brought her hands down to press into her eyes as she let out a frustrated scream. She was at her wits end. She pounded her fists into the ground beside her as she forced herself to breathe in deeply. She had to figure out how to make it stop before it broke her completely.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>In the past, when her world had felt like it was crumbling, she would escape to Lilia’s for guidance and respite but she hadn’t spoken to the woman since that very night. After the hospital, after she had dragged Ralph through the store gathering everything she could think Agatha might need in a last stitch effort to mend what seemed almost too broken to repair, she had sat in her car in Agatha’s driveway as the reality of what had happened fully hit her. Despondent in her grief and anger she had gone over out of reflex and unloaded all her pain onto Lilia who just sat and listened and held her when the weight of it all became too much to bear. Since then she had done her best to avoid her, ignoring the occasional call or text. She couldn’t help but feel resentment towards the woman for being the catalyst for her turmoil and was struggling to find a way to forgive her, though now her heart ached for her comfort. Once this wave of pain had settled she wiped away the last of the tears and hauled herself up from the ground. She took a centering breath, doing her best to release the last of her anxieties, and began the long journey back to her apartment, contemplating how to get out of this slump. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The sun was just starting to rise as she returned and she immediately headed inside and ran herself a scalding hot shower letting the steam seep into the aching pit inside her, soothing her frostbitten lungs. Once the water had drowned out the last of her worries she stepped out, wrapping herself in a plush towel and moved to look at herself in the mirror. After weeks of this anguish the image she was met with was a gaunt ghost of her former self. Eyes rimmed in dark circles, skin sallow and sickly, her collar bone protruding starkly from her chest. She had fallen further into despair than she had realized. She looked around, taking in the state of the bathroom. Towels strewn about, trash can full to the point of spilling over, clothes piled on nearly every surface but the sink. </span>
<em>
<span>How had she let it get this bad? </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She wandered out into her bedroom which was in a similar state, books thrown about, take out boxes on the floor, more dirty laundry in heaps about the room, several glasses and mugs hovering on the nightstand and shelves. She dug about, eventually finding jeans and a sweater clean enough to throw on, before pushing through to the kitchen and living room to take stock. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The coffee pot was half full though she hadn’t made any since her last day at work nearly five days ago, dishes were piled in the sink and about the counters, the fridge was empty save for 2 day old fries, a cup of coleslaw, and a series of condiments, take out bags were scattered about the living room, the couch was piled with a nest of blankets and pillows, and tissues clustered in the corners. </span>
<em>
<span>Perhaps if she cleansed her space it could help relieve the clutter in her mind.</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>She moved to pull the curtains open, letting the light of early morning break through the darkness she had secluded herself to. She grabbed her phone, hooking it up to her bluetooth speaker, and turned on a punk playlist as she began to reset the space. She moved about encouraging herself to dance and sing along to the music as she cleaned. A common remedy for the blues that she had picked up from Lilia. The act, though simple, did wonders to lift much of the sorrow that had settled in her body. With each space she resurrected a weight fell from her shoulders. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As she wrapped up the main living space she checked the clock, nearly 2:00, and she hadn’t had a bite to eat. Her stomach protested as she considered ordering in again so she decided now was as good of a time as any to finally go to the grocery. She climbed through the mess that was her room to search for her keys and wallet, finding them somehow hiding in her underwear drawer. She glanced around again at the state of her room, really smelling the musk she had created, and decided to start a load of laundry on her way out. She gathered up the nearest pile of clothes and threw them in her rolling hamper and headed out the door to the elevator. As she pulled the basket in behind her she noticed a ribbon of fabric trailing behind her. She quickly gathered it up as the doors began to close. </span>
</p><p><span>As she rode down she studied the fabric in her hand, silky, a dark purply blue with flashes of foliage. Her eyebrows scrunched as she searched her mind for the item this belonged to. She knew she recognized it but couldn’t quite place it. She brought the hand up to bite at her nails as she pondered and that’s when she smelled it, the faintest hint of lilac and honeysuckle. </span><em><span>Agatha</span></em><span>. She unraveled the item, letting the length drape off the sides of her hands as realization hit. </span><em><span>The belt to Agatha’s robe? How had that managed to snake its way into her things?</span></em> <em><span>She must have had it since Boston! </span></em><span>Naturally, not an item inconvenient enough to lose that you might reach out to your ex to get it back, but it was still her’s. As the elevator arrived in the basement she stuffed the item in her pocket, for whatever reason she couldn’t bring herself to wash it. She rushed down the hall, hurriedly threw her clothes in an open washer and headed back out, not wanting to ruminate on the discovery. </span></p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As she pulled into the grocery store parking lot, the bright winter sun beaming down, she was starkly aware of how isolated she had been keeping herself. Seeing the few other people milling about, doing their weekly shopping, just another Friday, it felt as if she was about to step out onto another planet. She eased the car door open and forced herself out and into the store. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The fluorescent lights flickered and hummed as canned oldies music crackled through the store speakers. The few people shopping and working were scattered about the store, each in their own little bubble. It was an eerie feeling, being around people somehow made her more aware of the loneliness that plagued her. She bit her lip in focus as she cycled through the produce, grabbing all of the staple items she could recall since she hadn’t bothered to write a list. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She meandered down aisles, hobbling together the ideas of meals, when her attention was caught by the song ringing out from the speaker above her. Silky strings flowed like a river as Etta James' velvety voice crooned out </span>
<em>
<span>At Last</span>
</em>
<span>. She was immediately transported back to their karaoke night when she had sung that very song to Agatha. She had felt it in her bones as the words poured from her lips. Agatha had been the piece of her heart she hadn’t known was missing and now, without her, she was left with this gnawing emptiness. Her heart fluttered with longing and she could feel her throat catch as she swallowed back the tears that were pressing at her eyes. Though she could feel another wave of grief approaching she only had a few more items to get, she needed to hold it together and not come apart in this store. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She quickly gathered the last of the things she could remember and headed to check out. She rolled up to the shortest line, finding a place behind a woman carrying a small infant. The child could only have been a few months old, and was transfixed by Rio as they gazed over their mother’s shoulder. With one hand in their mouth they gave her a toothless smile and began to kick their feet about happily. She chuckled softly at the attention and gave the child a small wave to which they replied with a series of squeals and coos gaining their mother’s attention. The woman looked at the child then back at Rio who had started making silly faces in response. She hurried to quiet her expressions and muttered a small apology. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman smiled back, unbothered, commenting, “Oh honey, you’re fine! Thanks for keeping him entertained. Normally by now he’d be screaming his head off but he seems to be taken by you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s pretty charming himself.” Rio offered with a half smile. The woman nuzzled her face into his plump baby cheek to which the child erupted in giggles as she started to unload her cart. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio felt her eyes growing misty as she observed the pair. She wanted this, her heart ached for it, a child, a family, love - in all its challenges and triumphs. And in that, more than anything, she wanted Agatha. She wanted to see her, </span>
<em>
<span>needed </span>
</em>
<span>to see her, to hold her in her arms once again and remind her how much she truly loves her. She could feel the wounds she had stitched together that morning once again pulling at the seams. She unloaded her own cart as her mind traced over a life she desperately wanted but feared she had already lost. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As she headed back to the car the weight of her longing grew heavier, nearly crushing her with grief. She hurried to put her groceries in her trunk before the wave of sorrow brought her to a halt. She had barely made it to the driver's seat before her vision was completely clouded by the waterfall of tears that had burst forth. She wanted more than anything to be able to move forward, past this unrelenting despondency, but it engulfed her mercilessly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She ached to reach out to Agatha but she knew that wasn’t wise in this disheveled state. Her next best instinct was to call someone, anyone, if for no other reason than to release some of the pain she was carrying. Her fingers navigated their way to calling Yelena, the first in her list of favorites. The phone rang out through the speakers a few times before clicking over to voicemail. She ended the call and immediately reached out to Nat, hoping she would be quick to answer. After the seventh ring she abandoned the call, dropping the phone in her lap as she collapsed forward onto the steering wheel. She sat there sobbing and alone as the grief overtook her, until she felt the buzzing of her phone in her lap. She sat up slowly and grabbed the phone to find Lilia was calling her. Her screen glowed with the photo of Lilia squeezing her as tightly as possible and planting a kiss on her cheek which drew her to answer. Despite her anger at the woman, despite the mess she had helped put her in, now more than ever she needed her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Lilia…” she croaked out as she wiped away the last of the tears. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh! Sweetheart! I wasn’t sure if you’d pick up. I’ve been thinking about you! Is everything alright?” Lilia’s voice cooed as she sensed the dismay on the other end of the phone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio bit her lip, trying to stave back another wave of tears.“It’s…I’m…I don’t…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What is it, doll? What’s going on? Talk to me!” Lilia’s directness at last shook loose the truth of her fears.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I…I can’t do it.” She choked out</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can’t do what?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I can’t let go of her. She’s all I can think about. I feel lost without her. How am I supposed to keep living like this?” The tears rushed forward once again as the words spilled out of her mouth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh honey! Where are you?” Lilia asked as concern flooded her voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I uh, I’m in my car at the grocery.” She managed to convey through streaming tears. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did you just get there?” She asked, calm but direct.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, I just finished up and barely made it out to the car before…” she trailed off as her breath began to stutter. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you ok to drive?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I just…I need to calm down.” she breathed shakily</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, good, take some deep breaths. Are you heading home?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Uh huh.” She grunted through a shaky breath as the tears began to ease. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright…you ok if I meet you there?” Lilia asked cautiously</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio bit her lip, weighing the anger she still harbored against the unrelenting agony, “Yes.” she finally relented.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ok, I’m on my way. Take your time, make sure you’re calm enough to drive and I’ll see you soon.” Rio could hear keys already moving in the background of the call.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, see you in a bit.” She murmured then hung up the phone. She laid her head against the headrest as she refocused herself. She had been doing so well and in an instant it had all come crashing down once again. Once she felt the steadiness return to her hands she turned on her car and headed home. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As she pulled into her apartment lot she caught sight of Lilia’s van taking up nearly two spaces at the end. She turned off her car and let out a heavy sigh before forcing herself out of the vehicle. Part of her was glad Lilia had come yet she still wrestled with a deep resentment for what she had done. Had it not been for her interference she likely wouldn’t have had to endure any of this, though now she would never know. Now the depth of her sorrow outweighed her stubbornness to keep everyone at a distance. She needed comfort and if that came in Lilia’s form then so be it. She moved to the trunk, and began grabbing what she could as Lilia made her way over to her. Lilia rubbed a soothing hand on her back, saying nothing as she helped her grab the last of her bags and followed Rio inside. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio settled the bags on the counter and began to silently unpack everything. Lilia cautiously watched her as she did the same, waiting for Rio to start the conversation, not pushing, just allowing her to speak in her own time. She hummed a nameless, almost haunting tune, being sure to give Rio the space she needed to settle. As she was putting away the last items in the pantry she walked in on Rio wiping away a few stray tears. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, Honey!” She exclaimed as she dropped the box of cereal she was holding and rushed to pull Rio into a hug. Rio stilted at first but quickly relaxed into the caring embrace, the pressure and warmth soothing her most tender parts. After a few moments Lilia released her and gathered Rio’s face in her hands. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s make some tea and chat, yes? Tell me everything that’s been going on.” Rio nodded meekly at the invitation. “Go on, have a seat, I’ll get it set up. Just point me to where you keep your tea.” Lilia offered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I might be out, but if I have any it’s in the cabinet by the stove.” Rio grumbled as she headed out to sit at the kitchen island. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Might be out?! How could you be out of tea? Didn’t I teach you better than that!” Lilia chided teasingly as she searched the cabinets. Rio glared at her silently, she was not in the mood to entertain sarcasm. “Ah, well no matter, you know I always keep some in my bag.” Lilia shuffled over to her purse and pulled out three tins of loose leaf tea. “Green, black, or Oolong?” she offered. Rio quickly looked at the selection and placed her index finger on the green tea, sliding it over to Lilia. “Excellent choice, doll!” she praised as she tucked the other two away. “So where do you want to start? You want to tell me what got you so upset at the store?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, I don’t know, could it be that my life feels meaningless now that I’ve lost the love of my life, no thanks to you.” Rio bit as she stared down at the counter.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Dear, I am truly sorry for that. I know it doesn’t change anything but I sincerely apologize for my actions. They were completely inappropriate.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You think?” Rio chuckled sardonically</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It was a horribly misguided attempt to protect you, both of you, one that I deeply regret.” Lilia offered in earnest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Protect us? How in the hell was that supposed to protect us?” Rio snapped growing enraged</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well by telling you I was hoping to avoid all of </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> but I should know better that some things are just unavoidable. Perhaps it’s part of the journey that you have some time apart to realize how much you actually need each other.” she explained cryptically.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What the fuck are you talking about?” Rio spat as her patience began to wear thin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Dear, I could see this brewing under the surface since you brought her over for lunch! The connection you two have, the pregnancy, the impending strife and… other difficulties. You both seemed oblivious.” She explained matter of factly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We were.” Rio grunted through gritted teeth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Exactly, which is why I brought it to light. Things like this cannot live under the surface.” She warned, wagging her finger.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But did </span>
<em>
<span>you </span>
</em>
<span>have to be the one to say something? You couldn’t just let it play out, let us discover in our own time, you had to get involved!?” Rio scolded</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It seemed like a time sensitive issue.” She reasoned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But it wasn’t your issue to resolve! That’s what you’re not getting! This was between us! What you did, was fucking psychotic and it ruined everything!” Rio shouted, unable to restrain herself further.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll admit I may have crossed a line with the pregnancy test, but would you have believed me otherwise?” Lilia asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t know! Is that really what’s important here? Me believing you? Because now I don’t fucking trust you! Look at the position you put me in! Why didn’t you just go to her in the first place. Instead you burdened me with the responsibility of telling her!” Rio raged.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You would have preferred I went up to your girlfriend and asked her about her pregnancy?” Lilia questioned, dumbfounded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No I would have preferred you not get involved at all!” Rio shouted with a sense of finality.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia stood silently letting the weight of that truth settle. “You’re right.” She finally breathed, “I shouldn’t have gotten involved. It’s caused you more pain than I could have imagined and that was the last thing I ever wanted for you.” The kettle on the stove had started to scream and Lilia moved to finish making their tea. “If I could go back and change it I would, but I can’t, the next best thing I can do is be here for you, anytime you need me.” She said, placing the mug of tea in front of Rio. “Do you want to tell me what else has been going on, like what got you so upset at the store and in the pantry?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio bit the inside of her cheek as she contemplated the contents of her mug. Lilia was right, she couldn’t change any of what happened, neither of them could. All she could do now is work through the aftermath of what was left. She let out a sigh as she resolved to explain. “It’s been weeks and I just can’t stop thinking about her. Nearly everything I do, everywhere I go, I’m reminded of her. I’ve never experienced anything like it. Even when I sleep I have these dreams, nightmares really, and I feel like I’m going crazy. I don’t know how much more I can take!” Rio’s voice faltered a bit as her nerves began to prickle with the dread she had woken up with.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lilia’s face was stitched in concern. “Oh, sweetheart” she moved to gather Rio in a hug.  “Maybe your heart is trying to tell you something? Tell me about the dreams.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“They’re awful! I’m usually chasing her and she’s just out of reach. Half the time when I catch up with her she explodes with rage and tries to kill me.” She sat up straighter anxiously, looking Lilia in the eyes, “The other half of the time…somethings wrong, she’s in pain but I can’t help her. The one last night was…gruesome. I thought I’d lost her completely.” Rio felt a shiver run down her spine as the image of Agatha’s lifeless body flashed in her mind. </span>
</p><p>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia bit her lip as a sense of foreboding pricked within her. “Have you two had a chance to talk?” She asked, brushing a piece of hair behind Rio’s ear.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No.” Rio muttered as she looked down despondent into her mug.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Have you tried to reach out to her?” Lilia asked cautiously</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Something tells me that wouldn’t be welcomed.” Rio grumbled as she took a sip of her tea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You don’t know that!” Lilia offered reassuringly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She broke up with me! She pushed me away, refused to see me! I reached out to her friend after a week and heard nothing. I’m just trying to take the hint.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m sure I’m the last person you want advice from right now…” Lilia started</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’d be right.” Rio bit back</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But reaching out, letting her know you’re thinking about her and how you’re feeling might be what’s needed to resolve some of this distress you’re feeling.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know, I just don’t want to cause any more damage than I already have.” Rio groaned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What damage? Showing her you still care? Worst thing that can happen is you don’t hear back, but at least you know you’ve laid all your cards on the table. Best case scenario you get to talk with her and have some sort of resolution one way or another.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio mulled over Lilia’s advice as she swirled her tea. “I can’t say it hasn’t crossed my mind. It’s just every time I think about it I’m reminded of just how terribly it all went that night and I don’t know if I can survive another disaster like that. I mean look at me now I’m barely holding on by a thread, I look like I’m half dead.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You look like you’re exhausted, like you’ve been carrying this alone for too long.” Lilia offered gently</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Maybe I have, but it’s my burden to carry.” Rio reasoned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ah!” Lilia sighed knowingly. “Could that be what’s holding you back? You feel like you deserve this pain as punishment?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio blinked back stunned at the insight. “Don’t I?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, sweetheart.” Lilia cooed as she took Rio’s face into her warm hands. “You’ve punished yourself enough for this mistake. It’s time to let go so you can move forward.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How can I? It was a disaster, I ruined everything.” Rio cried frustratedly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“A disaster it may have been but you have to find a way to forgive yourself for what happened.” Lilia’s words hung in the air between them, breaking something loose within her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio pressed her eyes closed as tears leaked from the corners and she turned her head away from Lilia’s grasp. “I don’t know how to do that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Start with a deep breath.” She held onto Rio’s shoulders as they breathed together. “You can’t change what has already happened…” she said blankly as she stared into Rio’s eyes. “but you are still able to shape what lies ahead. Your heart already knows what it wants, you just have to find the courage within yourself to go after it, even if it’s messy and painful.”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio bit her lip before taking a sip of her tea. “Perhaps you’re right.” she muttered reluctantly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry, dear, what was that?” Lilia asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Perhaps you’re right!” She shouted back at her. “I’ll… give it some thought.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s all I ask.” She leaned in, pressing a kiss to Rio’s forehead then holding her face between her hands. “I hate to see you this way dear, and I deeply regret all that I did to put you here. I just want to see you happy again, and Agatha, she makes you happy. If there’s anything else I can do to help…” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“NO!” Rio shouted, a little louder than she meant to. “You’ve…you’ve already done so much and actually I still have to tackle a shit load of laundry.” She admitted, hinting to Lilia that she had tired of their grief session. “But I promise I’ll let you know how I’m doing and what’s going on.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I appreciate that! Please take care of yourself and have some ice-cream before bed, it should help a bit with the night terrors.” She wrapped her arms around Rio, squeezing her tightly in a hug. “I love you so much dear! Call me on Sunday, we’ll have lunch!” she said as she gathered her things.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio grumbled, “Love you too” as she waved Lilia out the door. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as Lilia was out the door Rio headed to her bedroom and gathered up another pile of laundry in a bag to take down and wash. She mulled over their conversation as she switched over the load. Maybe she was the one holding herself back. It’s not like Agatha would be the one to reach out, she had enough going on. If this is something she wanted, as desperately as she knew she did, she would have to swallow her pride and make the first move, even if it ended in the rejection she had been so desperately trying to avoid. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She washed and sorted and folded load after load of laundry as she began to plan out reaching out to Agatha. Should she text her? That felt too informal, and especially after how long it had been, rather insincere. She thought about calling her or sending a voice message but worried she would stumble over her words or say the wrong thing in the moment. Just showing up was out of the question, she knew catching her off guard in person would only end in disaster and she didn’t think she would be able to handle the pressure. The safest option would be to send her a letter. Old fashioned as it was, it would give her the opportunity to plan out exactly what she wanted to say and give Agatha space and time to react, which could only work in her favor. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Having folded the last of the laundry she reached for her phone to check the time. 7:30, and she had two missed calls from Yelena. She tapped the notification returning the call. The phone rang twice before Yelena’s voice burst through the phone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Holy shit! She lives! Vidal, where are you?</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m at my apartment, where are you?” she chuckled back at the unexpected question.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Is it that one in the school?</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes…? Why?” Rio asked, growing suspicious as she could hear another voice mumbling in the background.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Is that on Sycamore or Main?</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yelena, where are you? Who are you with?” She asked as an amused smirk pulled at her lips.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>I’m driving around with Nat.” </span>
</em>
<span>she snorted as Nat shouted expletives in the background. </span>
<em>
<span>“We’re having trouble finding your apartment.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What do you mean? Don’t tell me you two drove all the way out here!” She exclaimed in disbelief.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Dude! We haven’t heard from you in weeks! You dropped that pregnant girlfriend bombshell when you visited and then fucking ghosted us! Honestly this is an overdue wellness check.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled in astonishment. “I’ll text you the address. Park anywhere in the faculty parking lot at the front, I’ll meet you out there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Hell yeah! See you soon!</span>
</em>
<span>” Yelena cheered as she hung up the call. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stared at her phone for a moment processing what was happening. Her friends drove four fucking hours to visit her. Until hearing Yelena’s voice on the phone she hadn’t realized how badly she needed their intervention. She hurriedly texted her the address and rushed to put away the last of her laundry before heading down to meet them. As she opened the front doors she could see their headlights pulling into the lot. Yelena leaned out the passenger side window waving to Rio as she called out, “We were like only two streets away but somebody kept taking the wrong turn!” She looked down into the car at Nat as the vehicle rolled to a stop in one of the parking spaces. Immediately she sat back down to throw the car door open and rushed to tackle Rio in a hug.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How are you guys here right now?” Rio managed to cough out once Yelena released her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It was Yelena’s idea. She said if we didn’t hear from you by this morning we were heading out. We’ve both been worried about you, with everything going on. How are you holding up?” Nat asked, as she locked the car behind her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ve been better.” she grunted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No shit! I don’t think I’ve seen you look this miserable since residency!” Yelena laughed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t think I’ve been this miserable since residency!” she chuckled back</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That bad huh?” Nat asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You have no idea!” Rio groaned as she rubbed her temples at the thought.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Then you’ll just have to tell us all about it! Have you eaten anything?” Yelena asked excitedly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, hadn’t even thought about it yet.” she admitted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sweet, we almost stopped like an hour out but we decided to wait and see if you’d like to join us. Figured you could probably use a night out.” Yelena explained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Honestly, that sounds amazing.” She breathed, as a glimmer of relief bloomed in her chest. “Let me go grab a jacket and my bag and we’ll head out. I know a great wing place!” she shouted as she headed for the doors.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh! Wings sound amazing right now!” She heard Yelena groan as she hurried back into her apartment. She quickly threw on a pair of sneakers, grabbed her bag, and hunted around for her leather jacket. With everything clean and put away she figured it would be where she always kept it, carefully hung in her closet, but it was nowhere to be found. After a few minutes she gave up the search and settled on her oversized black corduroy jacket and headed down to her friends. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Finally! Let’s go! If I don’t have wings and fries in my face in the next 30 minutes I might pass away!” Yelena roared as she settled into the back seat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You ok to drive since you probably know where we’re going?” Nat asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah that’s fine, it’s not far anyway.” Nat tossed her the keys and she quickly settled into the driver's seat. As they pulled away from the curb Nat turned on an obscure playlist and Yelena babbled about their journey to her. It felt like home, safety, and for the first time in weeks she could feel herself starting to relax. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Within the hour they were seated and digging into a feast of wings and appetizers as Rio regaled them on the calamity that had ensued. How Agatha had shown up when she was talking with her friends and broken things off. How she had chased her and blurted out that Agatha was pregnant in a desperate attempt to save their relationship by finally telling her the truth, the whole of it. Agatha’s initial disbelief and the work her friends did to help convince her which eventually sent her into a panicking spiral that had her running across the parking lot until she stopped to spew the contents of her stomach on the Chili’s sign. How she had pushed her back in disgust before they all headed to the hospital and confirmed what Rio had known for weeks at that point. How Ralph, her very gay best friend, was technically the father. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As she painted the picture for them she found herself more than once laughing at the absurdity of the situation. She sat back, amused when their jaws dropped in astonishment or their eyes flashed in shock at each new piece of information she revealed. They let her work her way through the entire series of events, barely touching their food as they were too engrossed in her story. Once Rio finished, Nat and Yelena stared at her blankly working to wrap their heads around all she had explained. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You two are awfully quiet.” Rio smirked as she stole one of Nat’s fries. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I…I just…I guess…where are </span>
<em>
<span>you </span>
</em>
<span>at with all of this?” Yelena asked earnestly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span> “I wish I could say I was over it, that it was just another fling like all the others and I’m moving on but…I’ve never felt this way about someone before. We’ve had some space and it’s only made me want her more. Everything reminds me of her, it’s like she’s haunting me or something. I’ve been hesitant about reaching out, I don’t really know where we stand and I don’t want to cause any more damage than I already have but, I think I’m at a point now where I have to at least see if there’s any chance for us to fix this, for my own peace of mind if nothing else.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wow, I never thought Rio Vidal would ever be this pussy whipped.” Nat chuckled teasingly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shut the fuck up!” Rio groaned as she threw a crumpled napkin in her direction.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Seriously though, the fact that you’re still this infatuated with the woman after </span>
<em>
<span>everything</span>
</em>
<span>? It’s either destiny or delusion! Regardless, we're here for you, any way we can be.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thanks.” She mumbled through a half smile “Just the fact that you guys came means everything. You have no idea how badly I needed this, just needed a break from it, from myself! This is the first time I haven’t felt depressed as shit since this happened.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, then I guess I’m glad we made the trip!” Yelena gleamed as she stood from the table. “I’m gonna run to the restroom, I’ll be back.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They sat in silence for a moment as Nat finished her food before Rio asked, “Am I crazy? For wanting to do this?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Most definitely but, if it’s what you want,” She shrugged, “You’ve gotta go for it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You think so?” she asked as she bit her lip.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re going to regret it more if you don’t.” Nat warned as she ate the last of her wings.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio fidgeted with her fingers as she wrestled with the doubt that had been plaguing her. “What if…what if she doesn’t want to talk?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nat breathed a sigh of understanding, “She may not! Though, I’d be surprised if she didn’t also have some unresolved feelings about how things ended up. All you can do is tell her how you feel and give her the space and opportunity to talk if or when she feels comfortable doing so.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio sat back in awe of the simple practicality of Nat’s advice. “Damn, why do I feel therapized by that?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nat chuckled, “My therapist said the same thing about reconnecting with my half-sister.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh yeah, how’s that going?” Rio asked excitedly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Really well actually! She’s coming to stay with me next month, I’m going to show her the city and I’m going to visit her in the fall at her ranch.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh that’s amazing! I’m so happy for you both!” Rio beamed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thanks! It’s been a long time coming but I’m glad we’re finally making the effort to see each other.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright, so I’ve been thinking…” Yelena said as she returned to the table.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Uh-oh, that’s never a good sign.” Nat groaned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ve been thinking…we should go out tonight.” She smiled with a wicked gleam in her eye</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We are out.” Rio replied flatly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, I mean </span>
<em>
<span>out </span>
</em>
<span>out. You need to blow off some steam and take a break from thinking about this clusterfuck you’ve found yourself in.” She said, pointing to Rio. “You just survived a week in hell with Dr. Dickhead and I know you need a drink.” She pointed at Nat “And I want to go to this drag show.” She pulled up a picture of a flyer that had been hanging in the bathroom stall. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Tonight?!” Rio asked trepidatiously </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes tonight! It starts at ten, I looked it up, if we leave now we’d get there about when it starts.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t know, what are you thinking Nat?” Rio asked, not entirely convinced.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Completely up to you, I’m fine either way.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Come on! We’re only here for the weekend! When is the last time we’ve gotten to do something like this together?” Yelena pleaded</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fine, just let me pay the bill.” Rio relented</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I already took care of it!” Yelena cheered gleefully “Come on, I want to make sure we get there before it’s standing room only!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio and Nat chuckled as they followed Yelena out of the restaurant and all piled into the car. Yelena insisted she drive since she already had the address up on her phone so Nat reluctantly squeezed into the back seat as Rio settled into shotgun. Having sifted through the mayhem of her life the conversation quickly settled into their usual banter. Yelena divulged the work gossip as she filled Rio in on what had happened since she left and Nat interspersed her commentary as she saw fit. Rio hummed along, half listening as she watched the world go by out the passenger window. She let herself revel in the comfort of it, the familiar cadences soothing the raw edges of her grief. That was until they pulled up to their destination. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As Yelena parked and she and Nat exited the vehicle, Rio sat eyes wide with dread, it was Alice’s bar. The bar where Agatha had run into her with the door. Where she had sat across the runway mesmerized by her presence. Where she had struggled to work up the courage to ask her to dance, and somehow she had agreed, and though it was brief it had been the best night of her life. Of course, of the several gay bars in this city, it had to be this one. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you coming?” Yelena called to her through the window. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She took a deep breath. It’s not like Agatha would be there, she didn’t really go out before and now it was even less likely. Though that didn’t mean she couldn’t end up running into one of her friends, it </span>
<em>
<span>was </span>
</em>
<span>Alice’s bar after all. The idea of seeing one of them was simultaneously terrifying and thrilling. She opened the door and slowly joined her friends, deciding to keep this nugget of information to herself, at least for now, not wanting to get ahead of herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You good?” Nat asked as they joined the end of the short line</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, fine, just a little tired.” Rio claimed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“OOO we should get some espresso martinis when we get in there.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Though that sounds delicious I think I’m going to struggle through it. If I drink coffee now I’m never going to get to sleep! Besides, one of us should plan to drive home.” Rio reasoned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You sure? I don’t want you to miss out on the fun!” Yelena asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I’ll have a good time regardless.” She replied, partially as encouragement to herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As they approached the door she could feel a nervous pit swell in her throat. This was the moment of truth. Part of her hoped at least one of them was there. Maybe she would have a chance to ask them how Agatha was. Another part was gripped with fear at possibly being spotted and not welcomed. She didn’t want to cause any more drama. Her mind did its best to quiet these voices, reasoning it was more likely that none of them were there and she could just enjoy a night with her friends. Though as she finally stepped through the doors and her eyes scanned the crowd her heart dropped and a cold chill ran down her spine. Fate couldn’t help but be cruel. There sat at a table against the far wall, clad in a dark flowing dress, her long hair cascading down her shoulders as the neon glow of the stage lights illuminated her in an ethereal radiance, was Agatha. </span>

<span>In the weeks that followed Agatha struggled to adjust to the demands of her new life. Work was practically drowning her. Not only did she have the tasks Herb had assigned to her, reviewing the companies he had selected to help manage operations and interviewing and organizing vendors for each of the four weekends, she had managed to absorb Freddy’s responsibilities as well, at least for the time being. After his meeting with HR that following monday he was put on administrative leave as they investigated his questionable conduct. This meant that every minute of her day was now booked solid. From the time she arrived until Sharon would force her to leave, she was in meetings, on calls, or holding interviews. It was beyond more than what she had bargained for and after three weeks she was looking forward to Herb's imminent return.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When she wasn’t working she was doing her best to come to terms with a body that still felt foreign as it continued to make room for the child growing quickly inside of her. It was as if it had been withholding this secret, waiting to reveal all once he had been discovered. In just these few weeks her son truly began to make his presence known, kicking, nudging, and squirming, expanding her from within to the point that more than once she dissolved into a teary rage trying to find clothes that still fit. The shock of it all had pressed into wounds she hadn’t realized were still tender. After all this time it brought up fears and worries that she had kept buried deep, hidden even from herself. </span>
<em>
<span>What if she couldn’t do it? What if her body couldn’t do it and failed her again? If something were to happen to her, what would happen to the baby? </span>
</em>
<span>She found that, despite the abundance of support around her, she still felt overwhelmingly alone and vulnerable. </span>
</p><p>
<span>With Sharon’s help she somehow made time for follow up visits with Dr. Allen who reaffirmed that all was well and relatively healthy for both of them. Jen, despite her demanding schedule, made herself readily available for all of Agatha’s concerns and questions whenever they arose. Ralph, true to his word, took over much of the housework. Many mornings he would wake up and make breakfast for them then spend his days organizing, cleaning, and removing most of his things from her house. He made time to take her shopping for a new wardrobe that actually fit. He even managed to rope Alice into helping him paint the room the particular shade of sage green that she had mentioned the night she came home from the hospital. It was all a relief and a much needed buoy in the storm surge that was her life, yet there was still an unrelenting ache that she couldn’t seem to shake. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Despite the pain she had caused her, Rio was an ever present thought hovering at the back of her mind. In the beginning these thoughts brought a rush of panic and anger to the surface. She felt betrayed, lied to, humiliated in front of everyone! She had opened her heart enough to let herself love again and had let herself believe that Rio truly loved her. That the bond they had quickly created was deep and unwavering, but after this…</span>
<em>
<span>How could she trust her? </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Over time, as the fear and anger began to release her from their grip, a sense of conflicting guilt crept in overtaking their place. This child, though a life shattering shock, was everything she had ever wanted. She barely knew him and already he had completely stolen her heart. She was grateful for every step that had brought him to her and yet she was devastated that he had come along when he did. It had cost her everything. The joy and love and safety she had found in Rio vanished. Yet now, as she faced the second half of her surprise pregnancy along with an overly demanding work life, she needed Rio’s comfort and stability more than ever. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As the weeks wore on and she heard nothing from Rio, she felt a bitter disappointment begin to take root. For all she had professed in her soliloquy about the love she had for her, this silence felt like a dagger to her heart. She had prepared herself for this eventuality, after all why would Rio want to stick around? Yet as it sunk in that they may indeed be over, it stung sharper than she had expected. </span>
<em>
<span>Had it all been a lie? Had she moved on, not wanting to deal with the mess that had become her life? Could she really blame her if she had?</span>
</em>
<span> After all, when it came down to it, she was the one who ultimately put them in this position. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She dissected things over and over with Ralph, the qualms and grief she still held, yet each time he suggested she be the one to reach out and talk things over with Rio she dismissed him claiming she didn’t have the time to deal with it on top of everything else. </span>
<em>
<span>Perhaps after everything settles</span>
</em>
<span>, she would tell him then hurriedly change the subject, not wanting to commit to when that might be. She held on to so many questions that were still left unanswered but for now she let the idea simmer in the back of her mind like a pot hovering on the stove, unsure of when it would boil over. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As the third week drew to a close she resigned herself to the fact that, though it had seemed like fate at the start, she and Rio were likely too broken to repair. She had to move on, focus on her impending single motherhood, and push through these hectic months until he arrived. Herb would be back the following Monday and she had managed, with Sharon’s help, to accomplish nearly all the tasks he had set forth, including Freddy’s responsibilities. She would be able to hand back a good portion of the work and settle into a steadier routine. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Though, just as Herb was set to return, she was also going to lose Ralph to his next cruise contract. She had come to depend on him, to an extent, filling in the gaps she was losing to her overly demanding work life. But as the week turned it would all be gone. She would be back to her regular schedule, coming home to a silent house. The impending void brought renewed fears of doubt and uncertainty. </span>
<em>
<span>How could she possibly survive this alone? </span>
</em>
<span>She wasn’t yet sure but for now could only take it one day at a time.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—-------------------------------------------------------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As Friday rolled around she felt a mixture of relief and anxiety. She had survived the trial of managing everything Herb had set yet she was another day closer to solitude. The day went by in a blur. She had a few final meetings in the morning, a quick lunch as she caught up on emails and meeting requests, and rounded out the day organizing contracts and documents to present to Herb on Monday. She was in the home stretch, packing up her things when her phone rang with an unexpected call from her lawyer. Her heart skipped a beat as she answered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Valentina! I’m surprised to hear from you, you usually just email me.” She greeted, doing her best to sound nonchalant.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha! Hey, yeah, I thought this might be better to talk over the phone.” Valentina was a sharp and direct woman. This was a boon when it came to handling legal matters but tended to make difficult conversations sting in their bluntness. At her tone Agatha prepared for the worst.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Everything alright?” She asked as her nerves pricked in anticipation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s your mother. She’s appealed the temporary restraining order and it was granted to her so it’s no longer in effect.” She stated casually as if reading an item off of a list, though the words landed like blows.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s stomach dropped. Evanora couldn’t possibly consider visiting her after everything that happened in Boston. “Oh.” she breathed through the lump in her throat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And I wish I could say that was the worst of it but she’s suing you for ownership of the house.” Another direct hit, one that nearly knocked Agatha off her feet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?! Can she do that?” She gasped in shock.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She can try. She’s claiming to have found an amended will leaving her the estate.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That doesn’t make any sense! </span>
<em>
<span>She </span>
</em>
<span>was the one who reached out to </span>
<em>
<span>me </span>
</em>
<span>about the will in the first place!” Agatha cried in frustration</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m inclined to believe this holds no water, authenticity remains to be seen, but regardless this will likely end up before a judge at some point.” Valentina wasn’t holding any punches.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck.” Agatha breathed exasperatedly as her hand braced her forehead.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“This also means you won’t be able to sell the house until this issue is resolved.” At this point Valentina had her on the ropes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re kidding me?!” She screeched into the phone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Believe me, I wish I was. Look, they're going to try and drag this out, I’m opting to handle it sooner rather than later but I need your input and availability.” Finally a breath in the onslaught of devastating news.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I mean… yes! I don’t want to be sitting on this house forever, let alone deal with her longer than I have to. When do you think we can get before a judge?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m hoping to work something out for early to mid April. Would that work for you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If we can get this dismissed I’ll make it work.” Agatha agreed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s kind of what I figured. I’ll go ahead and submit the paperwork and get back to you when I have a date.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sounds like a plan. Thanks Val!” Agatha groaned as she hung up the phone. This was the last thing she wanted to have to deal with. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>—---------------------------------------------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As she stumbled through her front door, furious about the call from her lawyer and exhausted at having survived the last week, she threw her things to the side and flung herself down onto the couch with a grunt.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Tough day at the office mama?” Ralph called from the kitchen as he rifled through the pantry. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The day was tolerable up until the end.” she sighed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Uh-oh, what happened? Did they let Freddy back in the office?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Gods no! I’m pretty sure they’re just waiting for Herb to get back to officially fire him.” She huffed in amusement. “No, I got a call from my lawyer.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh, that’s never a good thing. What did she have to say?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That my mother is </span>
<em>
<span>suing </span>
</em>
<span>me for the house.” She groaned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She what?!” Ralph shouted as he slammed the pantry door closed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah and I have to go to court if I want to get it dismissed.” she added, frustratedly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck, when is that happening?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t know yet, Val said early to mid April.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shit! Does this mean you’d have to see your mother?” He asked tentatively</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“More than likely yes, particularly since she also got the restraining order dismissed.” she added</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Damn you cannot catch a break with that woman!” He sighed as he sat in the armchair across from her. He looked her over for a moment before asking, “Do you think she knows?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Knows about what?” Agatha asked, confused.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What do you mean </span>
<em>
<span>knows about what</span>
</em>
<span>? The pregnancy obviously! She always seems to keep tabs on you one way or another!” He reasoned</span>
<span>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh fuck!” She groaned as she pressed her hands into her face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did you seriously not think about that?” He chuckled</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No! It wasn’t top of mind when she told me I was being sued! Hell, I don’t know! I’m sure she’s just doing this to get back at me for what happened in Boston.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What do you think she’s going to do when she finds out?” He asked, looking nervous.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Who fucking knows! It’s not something I have the time or energy to worry about now. I just want to take a bath, eat an ungodly amount of pizza and go to bed.” she sighed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So… are you not going to Jen’s birthday thing tonight then?” He asked judgingly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What? No, isn’t that tomorrow?” She asked as her eyebrows twitched in confusion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No mama, it’s tonight! Friday! It’s also my last show before my contract, remember?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She let out a pitiful whine. “Really? You two couldn’t have planned this for tomorrow and given me a day to rest at least?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sorry girl! You know how Jen is, this has been planned for months, before we knew about your little spawn. I’m sure she’d forgive you if you decided to stay home, all things considered.” He shrugged</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you joking?! She didn’t talk to me for a week after I didn’t wish her a happy nurse’s day and that’s not even a real day. If I missed her birthday she’d probably tell them I don’t want an epidural out of spite.” she scoffed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well they won’t be here until 7 to go to dinner so you have some time.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She looked at her phone, it was just after six. “Hardly! Don’t bother me until they get here.” She groused as she rolled into the couch, settling in for a nap. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fine by me! I’ve gotta go get ready anyway.” He rose and headed down the hallway to the bathroom.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As she curled in on herself scratchy hopped up to settle into the nest of space between her and the back of the couch. Satisfied with his position he nuzzled close and began to purr contentedly. She quickly began to slip into the twilight of near slumber but before she could tip over the edge she felt an insistent nudge just below her ribs. He’d been rather calm all day, but now as she was trying to rest her son had decided to stir. She pressed a hand to the spot, hoping to soothe him into rest, instead he pressed further outwards before shifting higher. Scratchy turned his head now looking at her stomach where he could sense a disturbance to his rest and purred heavily as he sniffed about. Seemingly in response her son rolled again within her. She let out a defeated groan before shooing Scratchy off the couch. She rested her hand on the crest of her stomach and rubbed slow circles with her thumb. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Come on kid, just give me 10 minutes, then you can party all you want.” she begged. There were a few more nudges until he finally settled again and she drifted off to sleep. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>

</p><p>
<span>Before she knew it she was being shaken awake by Ralph, now dressed as Lady Bohner in a sequined jumpsuit and a choppy, long blond wig. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jen?” She croaked groggily as she blinked herself awake. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She wishes!” Ralph laughed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are they here?” She asked as she looked around seeing no one else. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, we had a change of plans. She and Alice went ahead to dinner, I told them we’d meet up at the bar.” he explained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh. What time is it?” She asked as she searched around for her phone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Like 9:15? You were dead asleep, I tried to wake you earlier but you wouldn’t budge. We’ll leave in about 15 minutes. Come, have some pizza first.” He said with a smirk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You ordered pizza?” She asked, her voice breaking in relief as she peeled herself away from the couch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh absolutely! You mentioned pizza earlier and I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I got it from that one place you like that does the little squares. You two have your own veggie so eat as much as you want.” He offered as he slid the box towards her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She opened the lid and nearly cried at the sight, it was exactly what she had been craving. She picked up a slice, took a bite, and melted onto the stool at the island as a tear streaked down her cheek. After the day she had this pizza was stitching her back together piece by piece. “What the hell am I going to do when you’re gone?” She asked through a mouthful of sauce and dough. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Either make Jen’s life a living hell or,” He smirked at her with a glint in his eye, “if you get desperate enough, finally reach out to Rio.” He laughed, taunting her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She glared at him in annoyance. “Are we really going to have this conversation again?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha, come on! You like to pretend that you’re over it but I know you still think about her. Why not at least shoot her a text or something. See where she’s at?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t understand why I should be the one to reach out!” she exclaimed, bracing a hand to her chest. “I’m not the one who was keeping secrets from her! If she was so sorry and felt so bad about what happened then perhaps I should have gotten an apology by now, but no!” She snapped before taking a bite. “Besides, I’m sure she’s moved on at this point anyway and I see no reason to open that door.” she mumbled with her mouth full.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, technically, you </span>
<em>
<span>were </span>
</em>
<span>keeping a secret, it was just secret from the both of you.” He corrected. “I guarantee you that girl has been beating herself up about this since that night. You should have seen her on the ride home, she was distraught! Also, you were the one who broke up with her, aggressively I might add! For all she knows you’d kill her the next time you saw her. So, if anything, she’s probably just as scared as you are to hash this out.” he groaned frustratedly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m not scared!” she growled at him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Could have fooled me!” He chuckled </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why are you defending her anyway? Aren’t you supposed to be </span>
<em>
<span>my </span>
</em>
<span>friend?” She snapped at him</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I am your friend which is why I’m telling you you’re being a stubborn bitch about this!” He sassed. “After all you put her through you could at least give her the opportunity to explain herself. I’m not saying you two have to get back together, but I’d hate to see you lose out on someone I know makes you happy.” He insisted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’ve been hanging out with Alice too much.” She grumbled as she finished her pizza. “Come on, we better go before you’re late.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fine, we can drop it for now, just please think about it, for mine and Jen’s sanity if nothing else.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll </span>
<em>
<span>consider </span>
</em>
<span>thinking about reaching out to her, see if she’d be willing to talk. No promises!” She said, grabbing her keys.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh do the bare minimum, why don’t you!” He groaned as he followed her out the door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—————————————————</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood frozen in the entryway as her friends worked their way through the crowd searching for a seat. They hadn’t seen Agatha and knew nothing about the hurricane of panic building inside Rio. Seeing her now, enveloped in a halo of light, her navy dress flowing gracefully around her, Rio thought she was caught back in the nightmare she had woken up to that morning. But no, this was real, Agatha was just on the other side of the room and of course she was here. Rio had been avoiding facing her for so long that fate once again had chosen to intervene. She slowly began to back away towards the door. Agatha hadn’t seen her yet, there was still a chance she could escape before she inadvertently caused another scene. She turned and pushed through the doors and the line of people still waiting to enter into the brisk winter air. She rushed down the sidewalk towards the car until she heard a voice calling after her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio?! Rio, where are you going?” Yelena shouted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I need some air! I can’t be in there!” She shouted back, continuing her escape</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What the fuck? Why not?” Yelena asked as she rushed to catch up</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She’s in there.” Rio said, not breaking her stride</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?” Yelena shouted, unable to hear her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha, she’s in there!” She shouted more emphatically, still not turning to Yelena.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re joking!” Yelena giggled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Does it look like I’m laughing?!” she snapped rounding back on Yelena. “Sorry, I’m just…Fuck! Of course she’s here!” she breathed to herself as she began to pace. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh… shit!” Yelena breathed in shock. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah oh shit! What do I do? I can’t fuck this up!” She huffed as she paced, one hand on her hip, the other braced against her forehead. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well to start you should probably calm down and take a breath. It’s going to be fine!” Yelena replied reassuringly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You don’t know that!” Rio barked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, I do.” Yelena said calmly. “Nat and I are here with you. Whatever happens we’ve got your back! You’ll be alright, either way, I promise.” She gave Rio an encouraging smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re going to make me go back in there aren’t you.” Rio groaned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I do think you should come back inside with me.” Yelena urged</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio let out a laugh in defeat. “What do I even say to her?” she mumbled</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nothing if you don’t want to,” she shrugged, “but the opportunity is right here in front of you now to at least start the conversation. Will it be awkward and uncomfortable? Definitely! But if it’s what you want you’ll have to push past that and tell her how you feel.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio felt the sting in that truth. She was terrified to face Agatha and potentially ruin any hope of reconciliation by catching her off guard or saying the wrong thing. Yet, at the same time, she craved some relief from the inexorable guilt and despair she still clung to in her unresolved grief. As they stood there in the frigid blackness just outside the bar they heard the music blare and the crowd cheer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The show’s started. Are you coming?” Yelena asked, extending her hand “Nat found a table in the back. We’ll chill out, watch the show, and you can find her afterwards? OK?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Reluctantly Rio took her hand and let Yelena lead her back inside. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—------------------------------------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha and Ralph had arrived with barely fifteen minutes to spare before the show started, yet Jen and Alice were nowhere in sight. While Ralph went backstage to prepare, Agatha posted up at their regular table and waited impatiently for them to arrive. Her feet ached, her back was sore, her son was doing somersaults within her and she wanted nothing more than to go home and curl into bed, but after all Jen had done for her in these past weeks the least she could do was show up for her birthday. She sat, starkly sober, scanning through her phone while techno pop music blasted through the speakers and hordes of drunk gays mingled around her. It was less than five minutes until the show started before Jen and Alice finally wandered in bubbly and laughing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What are you two so giddy about? Did you have a nice dinner?” Agatha asked goadingly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, there’s some lesbian couple having a weird fight outside the bar!” Jen laughed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I could have sworn it looked like…” Alice started before Jen’s sharp gaze quickly cut her off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Dinner was very nice.” Jen said, looking only at Alice as she tried to hide a knowing smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Too bad you couldn’t join us, Ralph said you were dead to the world!” Alice sighed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Honestly I’m kind of glad that you two </span>
<em>
<span>weren’t</span>
</em>
<span> there! It’s been a hell of a week and it gave Alice and I a chance to…catch up.” At that Alice couldn’t help but giggle before she leaned in and kissed Jen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Gross.” Agatha huffed as she took a sip of her water. “Get a room!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Someone’s triggered!” Jen scoffed “I take it you still haven’t heard from Rio?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What do you think?” Agatha snipped as she shot her a sideways glare.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jeeze! Sorry I asked! Maybe you wouldn’t be so snippy if you just sacked up and texted her!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“OH! Am I being snippy? Maybe if you minded your own business I wouldn’t have to be snippy!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Maybe we should change the subject.” Alice offered in an attempt to make peace</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“At this point it is my business with how much I’ve heard you talk about her! You either need to get over yourself and text her or grow up and move on!” Jen chided</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“For your information I have moved on, which is why I’m not reaching out. I have nothing to say.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh please, you called me yesterday crying about how much you missed her!” Jen scoffed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I was hormonal! In case you haven’t noticed I’m six months pregnant!” Agatha spat</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Right, just hormonal!” Jen rolled her eyes, “It had </span>
<em>
<span>nothing</span>
</em>
<span> to do with the fact that you still have feelings for her.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Just then the lights dimmed and the music blasted as the emcee made her way to the stage.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Bite me!” Agatha grumbled</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“In your dreams!” Jen chuckled</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Please, guys, we’re here to have a good time alright!? Now both of you shut up and watch the show!” Alice scolded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—---------------------------------------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With the thick crowd all focused on the queen on stage Rio and Yelena were able to slip in without drawing any attention and made their way to Nat at a table in the back. Rio settled behind them both, doing her best to obscure any line of sight to her while she narrowed her focus on Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She was seated at the same table, right by the stage, as when Rio spotted her here that first night. The glow of the lights made her look impossibly radiant, her long hair cascading over her shoulder as she leaned back in her chair, legs crossed, one hand resting on the now evident swell of her stomach. Her face was stitched with an amused smile but her eyes gave away a quiet tiredness. Rio couldn’t help but wonder what her life had been like these past weeks. </span>
<em>
<span>Was everything alright with the baby? Was she alright? Had she thought about her? Was she still angry? Did she even care? </span>
</em>
<span>It was strange observing her in this state of unawareness, unbothered, not knowing the person who had devastated her weeks ago was mere feet away. She worked to squash that guilt and mentally prepare for what was destined to be another impossible conversation as the next queen took to the stage.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You all know her, you all love her, and if you’re not hard after this performance you’re probably dead. Please welcome to the stage our resident diva extraordinaire on her final night with us this season, Lady BOHNER!!!” shouted the emcee</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s attention snapped to the stage as Ralph strutted front and center and a loud blast from the speakers rang out, “It’s Britney Bitch!” and he began to work the crowd, dancing and lip singing to a Britney Spears medley. He immediately approached Agatha’s table, doing his best to embarrass her as he shook his ass in her face before turning to Jen and motorboating her in his silicon tits. She had been so focused on Agatha she hadn’t even realized Jen and Alice were seated with her. </span>
<em>
<span>Great!</span>
</em>
<span> Now they could all witness her pathetic attempt to win Agatha back, as if the pressure wasn’t already overwhelming enough. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She slunk further into her seat as he continued to make his way through the crowd, not leaving any table overlooked. It would only be a matter of time before he was at their table and all eyes would be looking in their direction, including Agatha’s. She could feel a panic rising in her chest again. She didn’t want to be discovered, not yet at least, but as she looked around she found herself trapped, they were in a back corner, she couldn’t even escape to the bathroom without drawing more attention to herself. The best she could do was hide from view as much as possible and hope that he didn’t notice her amongst the others. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The medley changed once again to Toxic as he narrowed in on their table. Nat and Yelena, unaware of who Lady Bohner really was, greeted him jovially and egged him on as he turned his attention to Rio. She did her best to brush off the focus, turning away from him shimmying in her direction, which he only took as a challenge to engage her further. He strutted around the table and plopped onto her lap, swinging an arm around her shoulder as she buried her face in her hands and he continued to lip sync. Eventually he stood and in her relief Rio dropped her hands from her face, just in time for him to turn around and smother her with his breastplate. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>It wasn’t until he stood back up that he finally saw that it was Rio. Had the music not been so loud everyone would have heard the shriek of shock that escaped his lips before he quickly gathered his composure and continued on with the show as if nothing had happened. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio could feel her heart racing as she dared to look back over at Agatha’s table. While the rest of the crowd had moved their attention with Ralph’s performance, everyone at Agatha’s table was now staring directly at her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As the table sat there in stunned shock Alice leaned over to Jen. “I knew it was her! You owe me $20.”Jen looked on, eyes wide in shock and mouth agape as she panned her gaze from Rio to Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was frozen, her icy stare fixated on Rio as her face cycled through a gamut of emotions. Shock, anger, and fear bubbled to the surface. Rio was here! After all this time, after weeks of silence, she was just across the room, staring hopelessly back at Agatha. </span>
<em>
<span>Could this really be happening?</span>
</em>
<span> Fate’s cruel sense of humor had pulled them together yet again. All the questions that still lingered swarmed her mind at once, drowning her in a sea of worry and doubt. It was too much, with her pain and exhaustion, her mother suing her, Ralph and Jen’s incessant taunting, and now this? She tried to blink away the tears that were quickly forming as she pushed herself away from the table.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Where are you going?” Jen shouted as the music blasted for another performer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m leaving! I can’t do this right now!” Agatha shouted back as she hurried through the crowd.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wait, I thought you were driving us home!” she screeched, but Agatha was already at the door.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As she looked on in horror, Rio could feel the desperation building inside of her. Based on that reaction this might be her only chance to talk with Agatha and she couldn’t let it slip by. She jumped from her seat and pushed her way through to the front door just as Agatha slipped out. She hurried out onto the sidewalk after her, finding her already halfway down the block and called to her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha! Agatha please wait!” Agatha continued on, pretending not to hear. Rio could feel the tears beginning to sting her own eyes as she rushed towards her, catching her before she turned the corner. “Agatha, please can we talk?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh really? After weeks of hearing nothing from you </span>
<em>
<span>now</span>
</em>
<span> you want to talk! Fat chance!” Agatha roared as she tried to walk away again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Please Agatha, I haven’t stopped thinking about you since that night! I just…I didn’t know where you were at with all of this! With me, with the baby, with everything that happened! I didn’t want to upset you any more than I already have!” Rio pleaded as she blocked Agatha’s escape.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well you’ve really done a bang up job of that haven’t you!” Agatha snapped as she pressed to keep moving.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha, I’m sorry! I’m so </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> sorry! I never meant to hurt you!” Rio cried as she followed closely behind.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How am I supposed to believe that?!” She rounded on Rio. “You lied to me! You went behind my back to gossip about me to my friends instead of just talking to me! How can I trust you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Please you have to believe me it wasn’t like that! I was so worried about you and the baby! I just wanted to make sure you had the support you needed when you did finally find out. I thought they could help! I never expected it all to happen like that! It was a disaster and I’ve regretted it ever since!” she admitted, hoping it would reach whatever soft spot Agatha may yet have reserved for her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha could feel the sting of her own grief rise to the surface “You knew! You knew for weeks and didn’t say anything!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What was I supposed to say?!” Rio asked exasperatedly “I didn’t know how it happened! I didn’t understand how you had no clue either!” she barked back pointedly. “I thought I was going insane! How could my girlfriend who’s not been with anyone in years be pregnant and </span>
<em>
<span>not even know</span>
</em>
<span>? You have to realize how impossible that felt!” She urged as Agatha looked on in silent guilt. “I’ve dealt with lying and cheating before but this was a completely different beast. I didn’t know how to handle it and it felt like I was going to lose you either way! I did what I thought was best at the time and it was a disaster nonetheless. All the pain it’s caused us both, I never meant for any of it!” The last words broke on Rio’s lips as tears were now streaming down her face. “I have been an absolute mess without you!” she sobbed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha struggled to keep her composure as Rio broke down before her. The kernel of resentment she had been feeding was shriveling within her at the truth laid bare. They were both to blame for how things had turned out, but were they really able to move forward past this? Agatha closed her eyes and took a deep breath before responding.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I…I can understand how that must have been difficult for you.” She uttered as her voice cracked, trying to keep her emotions at bay. “I’m…sorry…for putting you in that position. I should have realized what had happened sooner and ended things before they got so serious.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So that’s it then? That’s what you want? You really want to end this?” Rio hiccuped through drying tears, her honeyed eyes glowing gold in the street light.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Isn’t that what’s best?” Agatha choked out, trying to convince herself more than anything. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How could it be?” Rio gasped “Every second we have been apart has been utter agony. These past few weeks it’s felt like a part of me was missing, like someone ripped my heart out of my chest leaving a black hole in its place.” She felt a renewed string of tears trickle down her cheek “Agatha, please don’t do this…I love you!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The admission caught her off guard. “You can’t possibly mean that.” she muttered as she felt her eyes begin to prick with tears.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No?!” Rio asked as she took a step towards her. “Every moment I have spent with you has been richer, fuller, and more beautiful than I could have ever imagined my life being. You have brought a meaning to my life that I hadn’t even realized was missing. You are everything to me!” She took a cautious step closer, their breaths mingling in the cold air between them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You…you don’t mean that.” She uttered, barely more than a whisper, as the first tear fell.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I mean it more than you will ever know!” She breathed. “Agatha, I want you,” She reached out, taking Agatha’s hand in her’s, “I want this, all of it! Just…please…give me a chance…to prove it to you.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She looked up into Agatha’s stormy blue eyes, now cloudy with tears, glanced down at her trembling, pouting lips, then returned her gaze to those icy pools of blue. Seeing little hesitation she dared herself to lean in, closing the distance between them as she closed her eyes and softly pressed her lips to Agatha’s. At first it was hesitant, unsure, then Rio felt a hand caress her cheek as Agatha pulled her closer, drawing her further into the kiss. Rio responded with vigor, clutching at Agatha’s wrist as she consumed the woman before her as if she was the first sip of sweet water in a barren desert. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Their tongues and teeth clashed in a furious harmony as raw desire finally overcame the last of Agatha’s hesitation. One hand found its way to Rio’s hair weaving its way through her raven tendrils. The other arm wrapped around her shoulders, holding on to her as if she was the only thing keeping her afloat. Rio’s hands drifted down, clutching at Agatha’s waist before wrapping her arms around her completely so that there was barely air left between them. As Rio continued to chase the high of this requited love, the sweet taste of Agatha on her lips and the heady swirling scents of lilac, honeysuckle, and warm vanilla honey, they started to drift. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stumbled backward as they both began to lose their balance in the heat of passion. Rio swung an arm out as Agatha started to stumble off the curb and caught them both on the side of an SUV, inadvertently setting off its alarm. They jumped back onto the sidewalk in surprise, Rio still clinging closely to Agatha, one hand on her back, the other on her ever present bump as they dissolved into a fit of breathless laughter in the aftermath of it all. Rio looked down, catching where her hand was resting and quickly removed it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sorry about that! I didn’t mean to…” Rio started</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s alright.” Agatha gasped, still catching her breath “I think I can forgive you for that.” she shrugged.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There was an awkward pause before Rio dared to ask, eyes wide with pleading regret. “And what about the rest? Do you think you can find it in your heart to forgive me for being a spineless idiot?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, I don’t know about that.” Agatha said dryly with pursed lips as she straightened herself out. Rio could feel a sinking disappointment weigh in her chest. “I may need some more convincing.” Agatha smirked as she leaned back in for another kiss. This one was softer, more tender, as if writing an apology words alone could not fully express. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After a moment Rio reluctantly pulled away, resting her head against Agatha’s as she glanced down taking in the swell of her stomach. Agatha followed Rio’s gaze and ghosted a hand over the bump as she straightened herself out once again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How are you doing…with everything else?” Rio asked cautiously.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed heavily, “Exhausted but fine, all things considered.” She let a hand rest on her stomach. “Sometimes I wonder how much longer it would have taken me to realize had you not figured it out and said something.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m sure you would have noticed sooner rather than later.” Rio chuckled nervously, trying not to stare at the bump. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It has become a bit more obvious.” She admitted, “Particularly when he’s doing acrobatics as I’m trying to fall asleep. It’s like he knows I want to relax and decides it’s time to party.” she huffed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“He? You’re having a boy?” Rio asked, unable to hide a smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I figured at this point let’s not have any more surprises, you know?” Agatha chuckled</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fair enough!” Rio laughed, “When are you due?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Beginning of June.” She admitted. “With everything else going on, it hasn’t quite hit me yet.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wow, yeah, that’ll be here before you know it!” She chuckled nervously, chancing another quick glance down. “I’m…I’m glad you’re alright, I’ve been really worried about you, both of you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, we’re fine. A little restless, but fine.” She sighed as she pressed a hand to her side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is…is he…?” Rio asked, apprehensively looking between Agatha and the hand at her stomach.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Kickboxing my bladder? Unfortunately, yes!”  She groaned through a laugh. “Do you want to feel?” she asked, seeing Rio’s inquisitive gaze. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I mean, yeah, if that’s ok?” she stammered, still unsure. Agatha grabbed her hand and confidently placed it to where she was just holding. They stood there for a moment, Rio’s hand resting on the taught skin of Agatha’s stomach beneath her dress, but felt nothing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh come on! Don’t be shy now! You’ve been rolling around all night!” She groaned. Agatha held Rio’s hand there for another moment before she felt a slight nudge at her palm and her eyes shot up to Agatha’s as a smile broke on her lips.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“He’s really in there!” Rio gasped in awe</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh he’s definitely in there! I’m surprised he’s not showing off for you! He usually acts up when he knows somebody’s watching. It made the last obstetrics visit more difficult than it needed to be!” She huffed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh really?” Rio smirked “Did I hear that right? Have you been giving your mother grief, mister?” She asked as she rubbed her thumb gently over the spot. Almost immediately she was met with a firmer kick, startling her to where she drew her hand away in shock and let out a surprised laugh. “Perhaps we should head back in?” Rio suggested </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s face scrunched in disappointment. “Ugh, you’re probably right. Besides, I remember getting talked into driving everyone home at some point. If I left now Jen would never let me hear the end of it!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well we definitely don’t want to incur Jen’s wrath!” Rio laughed, “Shall we?” She offered up her hand which Agatha graciously took and they both headed back. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As they rounded the corner they saw all of their friends huddled together just outside the bar. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“There they are!” Nat shouted, prompting them all to turn and start shouting and cheering obnoxiously. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well it’s about damn time!” Jen huffed “I see Rio’s still breathing! I’m guessing you two have kissed and made up?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smiled guiltily, rubbing a hand against the back of her neck as Agatha rolled her eyes and threw her hair over her shoulder. “We may have settled our differences.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hell yeah!” Yelena cheered as she nudged Rio’s shoulder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fucking finally!” Jen roared “How many times do I have to be right before you start believing me?” She sassed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Eh…probably a few dozen more at least.” Agatha retorted. “Are we done here? Am I taking you home?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, we’re just waiting on Ralph. He should be out in a few.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We should probably head out. Yelena and I still have to check into our rental. Vidal, you coming?” Nat asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, go on ahead, I'll catch up in a minute!” She gestured for them to go and turned to Agatha. “If you’re up for it, I’d like to see you tomorrow. Maybe we can grab lunch or something?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’d like that.” She hummed through a smile. Rio settled her hands on Agatha’s waist and pulled her close, eagerly taking one final kiss. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“GET A ROOOM!” Jen shouted from the doorway of the bar. Agatha didn’t turn, she didn’t even break the kiss, she simply flipped Jen the bird over her shoulder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio reluctantly pulled away, taking in Agatha as if for the first time. Her crystal blue eyes, her fierce cutting cheekbones, the way her hair tumbled in waves down her back. How lucky she was to not only have found her and won her over, but to have lost her and gained her back once again. She knew in that moment, even if it took the rest of her life, she would prove her love to Agatha until the day she died. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Goodnight! I’ll call you tomorrow!” She promised as she stared into Agatha’s eyes. Before she left she glanced down and placed a gentle hand on the rise of her stomach. “Goodnight little man, take it easy on your mama! Let her get some rest, ok?” She felt a gentle nudge in response just below her fingertips. “That seems like a deal!” She chuckled</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll hold him to it!” Agatha laughed. “Goodnight!” She hummed as she hooked Rio by the chin and pulled her in for one last peck before watching her walk away into the night. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—--------------------------------------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Nearly an hour later, after she had dropped Jen and Alice off at Alice’s condo and regaled Ralph on the tea of running into Rio, she was settled into bed. Scratchy snuggled closely to her chest as she rubbed soothing circles across her belly, urging her son to settle. As she lay there, struggling to ignore the incessant movement just beneath her skin, she heard her phone buzz on the nightstand behind her. Unable to sleep she rolled over and checked the notification.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio Vidal - Hope you made it home safely my love! Counting down the minutes until I can see you. 🖤</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She smiled as Rio’s loving warmth spread through her chest, settling any final doubts she may have had remaining. For the first time in weeks she felt hope more than fear for her future. With Rio by her side the burden of pregnancy and impending motherhood lessened and she let the joy she had been holding at bay begin to seep into the vacant space. As she re-read the message she caught a quick speech bubble appear and disappear in the corner. Soon another message popped up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>If he’s keeping you up, remind your son of our deal! I love you, get some rest!</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<span>She typed a quick </span>
<em>
<span>I love you too</span>
</em>
<span> back and returned her phone to the nightstand. She rolled over, snuggling back into Scratchy, and resumed her soothing circles. “Alright kid, I know you made a deal with Rio! Now chill out, let me get some rest, and I promise I’ll get you ice cream tomorrow.” She felt him shift a few more times but he eventually settled and she drifted peacefully to sleep. </span>

<p>
<span>Agatha had awoken early that morning, her body tingling with anticipation for her lunch with Rio. The night before had felt like an odd dream. After weeks of separation Rio had appeared out of thin air, laden with grief and regret begging for Agatha not to end their relationship. To her own surprise she had let herself acknowledge her part in their destruction and in that vulnerability allowed Rio back into her heart. Now, in the harsh light of day she was questioning that decision. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It </span>
<em>
<span>had </span>
</em>
<span>been rash, spurred on by her undeniable desire for the woman, but was it really in her best interest and the interest of her child? She was timorous. Sure Rio claimed that this is what she wanted, but what did that entail? What could their life possibly look like going forward? And if she let Rio in and, down the line, Rio finally realized that this is not what she signed up for she wouldn’t be the only one to feel the impact of that loss. All these questions and more were buzzing around her head as she woke and it seemed the only way to dispel them was to follow through on her plans with Rio and ask her herself, though her stomach churned at the idea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She rolled over to the edge of her bed, hovering at the end as her body adjusted to the weight it now carried. She stretched, easing as best she could the ache in her back that had grown to become as familiar as the rolling shift of her son beneath her skin. This morning he was particularly active, as if embodying the nervous excitement of the day. She grunted as she pulled herself from the bed and hurried into the bathroom to relieve herself. Feeling lighter she rose and shuffled over to the mirror. It had become a daily ritual, observing the adjustments being made, the changes taking place as her body succumbed to the growing life inside of her. She had begun to start to see the ripples of his presence on the surface of her skin, and today they were as vibrant as ever. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A foot or an elbow pressed against the surface and she felt his head settle into her side. She rested a hand on the spot and greeted him warmly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good morning little bug! Big day today, huh?” He wiggled beneath her palm, kicking his feet about. “Don’t tell anyone but I’m a bit nervous myself. I can’t tell if I’m making a huge mistake here.” an urgent nudge pressed just below her belly button. “I know, I’m probably overthinking it, but there’s a lot to consider. You for instance!” He rolled about again, settling just below her ribs. “You might be safe now, all tucked away in there, but I’ve gotta make sure that’s the case when you get out here. That means not dating a crazy person!” She moved and began to search about for stretchy yoga pants and a sweatshirt. “She has to be crazy right?” she mumbled to herself as she tied her hair back. </span>
<em>
<span>Who in their right mind would sign up for this? </span>
</em>
<span>She slipped on her running shoes, grabbed her phone and headed out into the kitchen. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Ralph, per his new routine, was dancing away in the kitchen making breakfast. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What are you listening to this morning?” she asked as he slid her a bowl of fruit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Celine, mama! I’m adding </span>
<em>
<span>River Deep, Mountain High</span>
</em>
<span> to my set list for the cruise. Those geriatric bitches are going to eat it the fuck up!” He put his headphones away and let the music blare out through his phone speakers as he put on a show for her while he finished the pancakes he was making. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled at the performance. Ralph, in his ever effervescent nature, always had a way of lightening the atmosphere around him. She would miss this in just a couple days. He had made all of this not only possible but endurable and for that she owed him everything. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Someone’s had their coffee this morning!” she snorted as the song finished and he handed over a plate of pancakes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I did happen to run down to the coffee shop earlier and grabbed us each an iced latte!” He beamed, as he pulled the coffee from the fridge and placed her’s in front of her. “Figured you could use a treat before your big day! Don’t worry, it's baby safe!” He winked before grabbing his plate and sitting beside her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It better be, I don’t need him jumping around today any more than he already is!” Her lips twitched into a pleased smirk as she took the first sip.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, someone’s excited is he?” Ralph cooed as he patted her stomach. “Morning little man! Hope you like the pancakes,” he leaned down, placing a hand to the side of his mouth as if sharing a secret. “I added chocolate chips and sprinkles, but </span>
<em>
<span>shhhh</span>
</em>
<span> that’s just between us!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled at his antics. “Please, I don’t need you encouraging him, he’s already bouncing off my walls!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Gross.” He grimaced as he took a bite of pancakes. “Are </span>
<em>
<span>you </span>
</em>
<span>excited?” He asked, his voice syrupy with goading joy. Agatha groaned. “You get to see </span>
<em>
<span>Rio</span>
</em>
<span>!” he pressed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We’ll see.” She huffed, not taking her eyes off her plate. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What’s this, </span>
<em>
<span>we’ll see</span>
</em>
<span>? You were gushing last night about how you two were going to patch things up!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t know, I’m just…having second thoughts.” She mumbled as she took a bite of the pancakes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“About?” He questioned, his eyebrow raised in skepticism</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She can’t </span>
<em>
<span>really </span>
</em>
<span>want this, can she?” she admitted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha…” Ralph groaned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And if she does, what does that say about her?” she continued</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha…” He repeated, hoping to interrupt this spiral she seemed intent on diving down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Only an insane person would want to continue this relationship. I mean look at me, why would anyone in their right mind sign up for this?!” she rambled, growing exasperated</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha…” He repeated once again, though more emphatically</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“WHAT?!” She snapped at him</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t do this to yourself!” He pleaded</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ralph, I have to be realistic! Once she realizes what she’s agreed to there’s no way she’ll stick around!” she groaned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why are you talking yourself out of this again?” He asked, confused by her change in perspective. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha wrinkled her nose in frustration “I can’t bear to be disappointed again, and I don’t want to disappoint him!” She half shouted, rubbing her hand against her side as a rippling kick danced across it. “I just, I don’t know if it’s worth that risk, regardless of how I feel.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And how do you feel?” he asked bluntly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Somehow, the question caught her off guard. It shouldn’t matter, not when it came to her son and his well being. “I…I don’t know…” she mumbled as she turned back to her plate, barely letting the words fall from her lips. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“HA! I think you do!” He warned as he leaned back, crossing his arms as he gave her a once over. “You love her!” She could feel her cheeks flush at the observation. “and you’re afraid if you’re vulnerable and let your guard down you’re going to get hurt again.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I swear, I don’t know why I let you talk to Alice.” She waived her hand, dismissing his pointed truth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“However, maybe if you </span>
<em>
<span>are </span>
</em>
<span>vulnerable with her </span>
<em>
<span>and tell her how you feel </span>
</em>
<span>you can avoid that disappointment altogether! Don’t deny yourself this happiness just because of what might happen. And as for crazy…” He rolled his eyes, “I think you both check that box pretty evenly at this point so don’t go judging.”  He wagged his finger at her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh.” She snarled “Fine, I’ll go to lunch, but she’s still on thin ice.” She pushed herself away from the counter and stretched her back out again as best she could. “I need some air, I’m going for a walk.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—---------------------------------------</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As the sun rose high and light began to pour in through the slender window above the chalkboard Rio stirred to the sound of her phone buzzing beside her bed. She lifted her heavy, sleep drenched head, a string of drool hanging down still connected to the pillow, and blinked herself awake enough to grab her phone. She rolled over and through squinting eyes checked the messages that had just come through.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Yelena - Messages (4)</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>8:14 - Morning Sunshine! Let us know when you’re up and we can grab breakfast. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>9:37 - Wakey Wakey! Nat and I got tired of waiting so we’re going to grab something and head over. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>10:26 - Hope you’re up! We have the food secured and are headed your way!</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>10:41 - Ok, we’re like 5 mins out. Please tell me you’re up and can let us in. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio strained her eyes to check the time, 10:45. Shit! She couldn’t remember the last time she had slept this late. She rushed to throw the covers off and sit up, cross-legged at the edge of the bed, her knees resting on the surrounding platform as she stretched herself awake, falling back onto the bed. Just as she let out a heavy sigh her phone began to ring. She searched for it in the covers and quickly answered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hello?” Her voice croaked blearily</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Welcome back to the world of the living!” </span>
</em>
<span>Yelena chuckled at the other end of the phone. “</span>
<em>
<span>Did I wake you?</span>
</em>
<span>” She asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“More or less.” It came out as a barely audible grunt, “Are you guys here?” she yawned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Pulling in now.”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“</span>
</em>
<span>Sounds good, I’ll come get you. Just give me a second to put on some pants.” she grunted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>“You better hurry before I eat your breakfast!” </span>
</em>
<span>Yelena joked as Rio hung up the phone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio groaned as she lifted herself off the bed. Her whole body felt loose and heavy from the deep dreamless slumber she had fallen into as soon as her head hit the pillow. Having seen and talked to Agatha the night before, it was the first restful sleep she’d had in weeks. Her body ached pleasantly, having finally released the tension she had been holding throughout that time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She stumbled around her room gathering a pair of sweatpants and a hoodie and as quickly as she could slipped them on along with a pair of slides before heading down to collect her friends. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As she burst through the front doors the cold air and blaring sunlight shocked her awake. Though her eyes fought to adjust to the change in brightness she quickly caught sight of Nat and Yelena as they made their way up the stairs. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sleep alright?” Nat taunted as she passed by Rio into the lobby carrying a tray of coffees. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Dude, I was dead to the world! I don’t remember the last time I slept that hard.” She yawned as she closed the door behind Yelena. “What did you guys pick up?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We couldn’t decide. I wanted donuts, Nat wanted a breakfast burrito, so we went to a couple places.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well wherever you went it smells amazing!” she said as she grabbed one of the food bags from Yelena and led them up to her apartment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As soon as they were inside she threw her bag on the counter and hurriedly pulled out her phone. “You guys go ahead and get started, I just have to make a quick call.” She explained as she raised the phone up to her ear and moved to pace up and down the hallway as the phone rang. Nat and Yelena exchanged amused looks as they unpacked the bags.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t mind if I do!” Yelena chirped as she piled 3 donuts onto a plate. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Who are you calling?” Nat asked, noticing Rio’s strained expression as she began to bite at her nails. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stopped suddenly and held a finger up in pause to Nat as a smile grew across her face. “Hello, my love! I’m sorry to call so late, I slept in later than I meant to!” She lilted with a saccharinely sweet voice as she turned and headed down the hallway to continue the conversation in her room. “Are you still up for lunch today?” she asked before closing the door behind her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Dude!” Yelena exclaimed as soon as Rio was out of earshot</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know right?!” Nat emphasized as she tucked into her burrito. “How does she get herself into these situations?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No clue, but it’s like they get crazier every time she finds a new one!” Yelena exclaimed through a mouthful of pink sprinkle donut. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, I don’t know about that! Remember the one who tried to get her to join her family’s weird cult?” Nat snorted as she sipped her coffee.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, right! What was her name? Adelaide?” Yelena asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, I thought Adelaide was the one who we found out was already married to some guy.” Nat replied</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, you’re thinking of Margot!” Yelena corrected.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh shit! You’re right, I forgot about Margot! Well, and then of course there was Savannah.” Nat grimaced at the memory.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“God, I’m so glad that didn’t work out!” Yelena sighed, “I still can’t believe they were ever engaged! Remember when you caught Savannah fucking that buss boy at Hela’s christmas party?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh! Don’t remind me! I almost had that image wiped from my mind!” Nat gagged</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And I thought Rio was upset then! That was a mild inconvenience compared to this! I'm just glad it seems like they’re sorting things out. I mean, all things considered, at least she wasn’t cheating or secretly taken.” Yelena shrugged</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, just secretly pregnant!” Nat snorted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Exactly, it could be worse! When you really think about it, this is kind of what she’s been after all along.” Yelena reasoned as she finished her second donut.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“This…really?” Nat scoffed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well not this </span>
<em>
<span>exactly</span>
</em>
<span>, but a family. This one just happens to come with the baby already included. A two-fer if you will.” Yelena chuckled as they heard Rio’s footsteps patter back down the hallway.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ok! Crisis averted!” Rio huffed “I just have, shit, 30 minutes to get ready then I’ve gotta go pick her up. Fuck, I should have set an alarm. I really didn’t expect to sleep that late!” She pressed her hands to her face trying to relieve the residual tiredness.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is there anything we can help with?” Nat asked, seeing her getting flustered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No! I just gotta get moving. Thanks for bringing the food and coffee.” She grumbled as she rifled through one of the bags to find a hashbrown. “Sorry I can’t stay and hang with you today after you drove all the way up here! When are you headed out?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We’re not leaving until tomorrow morning so maybe we can catch you later tonight.” Yelena shrugged</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Tonight? Yeah that should be fine! If you want you can hang out here, feel free to check out the facilities, I’ll leave you my spare key.” She popped the hashbrown in her mouth and went and grabbed her keys off the hook by the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Cool, yeah we might hang around for a bit, though I think we might see a movie or something later.” Nat explained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Awesome! Yeah, text me later when you’re done and we can meet up! I’ve gotta go hop in the shower so make yourselves at home!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—------------------------</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Hours later, after a long thoughtful walk and a steaming hot shower, Agatha emerged from her room again dressed for her date with Rio. Her hair hung loosely down her back, still slightly damp from the shower. She had wedged herself into a pair of dark wash maternity jeans paired with black boots and threw on an oversized white dress shirt, leaving plenty of room for her son who was still squirming relentlessly inside her. The constant movement along with her trepidation at seeing Rio again was setting her nerves on edge. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“OW OW! Looking good mama!” Ralph cheered as she entered the living room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Please, I look like a marshmallow!” she scoffed “Have you seen my purse? I’ve looked everywhere for it!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Right here by the door, where you dropped it!” He said as he grabbed it and tossed it on the couch beside him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Of course it was! I swear I’d lose my head these days if it wasn’t attached. Fucking pregnancy brain.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“When are you headed out?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She should be here any minute. For a second I thought I got lucky and she forgot or came to her senses, but then she called me right when I got out of the shower.” She grumbled as she began to search through her bag.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh you thought you’d get off that easy, huh?” Ralph chuckled</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“One can dream!” She snorted as she pulled out the lipstick she had been searching for and headed to the bathroom to apply. “Where are you off to?” She hollered down the hallway after him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jen and I are going to start taking her stuff over to Alice’s. She’ll be here soon.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, did Alice end up asking her to move in?” She asked as she returned to the living room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, last night at dinner I guess. Jen was thrilled!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well she’s not wasting any time is she! Honestly, I don’t know how she’s lasted that long in that box she calls an apartment.” she scoffed just as a knock sounded at the door. She gave Ralph a dreadful look as she headed to answer it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She cautiously pulled the door open to reveal Rio, clad in black slacks a white dress shirt and a blazer. Her hair was loosely pulled into a low bun leaving a few strands falling around her face. Upon seeing Agatha her honey amber eyes gleamed with joy and relief and a bashful smile broke across her lips. Agatha felt her breath catch in her throat, seeing her again in the daylight, Rio was more captivating than ever. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hello, my love!” Rio cooed nervously. “You are looking…positively radiant! Here, I got these for you!” She handed over a modest bouquet of white tulips and yellow roses sprinkled with pink carnations and baby’s breath.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha took the flowers from Rio and gestured for her to come inside. “Thank you, these are…lovely.” She muttered nervously as she shot a look at Ralph and moved to find a vase to put them in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shuffled anxiously to stand at the back of the couch as she waited for Agatha. “Hey Ralph, good to see you again! Sorry if I startled you last night!” She chuckled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, honey, don’t worry about it!” He waved his hands dismissively as he rose from the couch to greet her. “Best surprise of the night by far!” He hummed as he swallowed her in a hug. “It’s great to see you again!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thanks!” She choked out, a little overwhelmed at the reception. “It’s good to see you too!” she beamed. As she pulled away her eyebrows quickly scrunched in surprised confusion. “Is…is that my jacket?” she asked, seeing the familiar worn leather and patches. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, shit, it might be!” He laughed “It’s been hanging up by the door, I thought it was Alice’s and figured she must have left it here at some point.” He explained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You wear it well!” She laughed astonished, only now remembering she had let Agatha borrow it on their first date, which now seemed like a lifetime ago. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ready?” Agatha chimed in abruptly as she grabbed her bag from the couch and headed for the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Indeed!” Rio flashed her eyes anxiously as the awkward tension swept by her along with Agatha. “Ralph, good seeing you again!” she flashed him a tight smile as she followed Agatha out the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Likewise! You two have fun now! Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do!” He shouted, tossing finger guns in their direction, causing Agatha to turn and glare as she closed the door behind them. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“So, are you driving or should I?” Agatha asked, more aggressively than she had intended, as she continued down the porch and out toward the cars parked in her driveway. Seeing Rio had already started to rattle her defenses and despite her best efforts she couldn’t help but find her annoyingly charming and endearing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I…I was planning on driving…unless you’d prefer to drive…It’s up to you.” Rio babbled, still cautious about saying the wrong thing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stood at the edge of the driveway, digging around in her purse once again, this time in search of her sunglasses, which conveniently gave her time to regain some sense of self-control which was slipping like sand through an hourglass. As she slid on the glasses she finally turned and deigned to answer Rio. “No, it’s fine, you can drive.” she replied dismissively with a wave of her hand as she continued on towards Rio’s car with her closely in tow. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As they approached the vehicle Rio rushed forward to grab the door for Agatha, who gave her a sideways look as she slowly settled into the car. Rio rushed around, trying to brush off the awkwardness as best she could before climbing into the driver's seat and quickly setting them off. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Minutes ticked by in silence as they drove. Rio kept her eyes focused on the road, merely glancing in Agatha’s direction every now and again. Agatha had herself pressed up against the side of the door, an elbow crooked against the arm rest as her fingers pressed against her lips. Her other arm draped protectively against the swell of her stomach, feeling her son hum beneath her fingers, as she stared out the passenger window. The tension was thick in the space between them, begging for one of them to carve their way through it to reach the other. Agatha, resolute in her aloofness as a means of control, was doing all that she could to deflect any attention that would spark a conversation. Offering a tight, but albeit nervous, smile anytime Rio looked in her direction. Rio, on the other hand, was summoning every ounce of courage she could to form a coherent enough sentence to hopefully relieve the building pressure between them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So…” Rio eventually stuttered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So…” Agatha echoed, though she kept her attention on the world moving around them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did you sleep well?” It was the most benign thing she could think of. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Reasonably well. And you?” she asked, yet still refused to turn and look at Rio directly. Too afraid of how her feelings for the woman might overshadow her better judgement. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Best night’s sleep I’ve had in a long while, actually.” She chuckled nervously as she chanced another glance at Agatha. “If Yelena hadn’t texted me I might have slept straight through our lunch!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That would have been…unfortunate.” Agatha muttered as she began to bite at her nails. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re telling me! I’ve been over the moon since I saw you last night. I still can’t believe this is real, that you’re really here with me again. I was afraid you’d never want to see me after what happened, which would have been totally understandable, but I can’t even begin to tell you how lost I felt without you.” Rio dared to reach her hand across the center console and pick up Agatha’s, weaving their fingers together. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s attention was finally broken from the window as she looked down at their clasped hands. Rio’s palm cradling hers, their fingers perfectly entwined as if they were roots that had grown together. She could feel her pulse quicken at the anchoring warmth that emanated from Rio. That ever soothing aura that had captivated her from the very beginning. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes…I…I’ve missed you too.” It came out shakier than she had expected. She fought to pull her attention back to the passing cars, but in her weakness her gaze flickered over to Rio and paused. A peaceful smile was settled on her lips, her golden eyes twinkled in the sunlight, her raven hair kissed the bow of her cheekbones as it danced across her face. She closed her eyes and forced herself to return to looking out the window. This was going to be more difficult than she had thought. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As they continued on, driving in silence once again, their hands remained intertwined. Rio’s steady heartbeat harmonizing with hers in a calming melody that pulsed between them. After a moment in this peaceful limbo she relaxed into the growing warmth that was spreading throughout her body. It was becoming difficult to deny the safety and comfort Rio’s presence brought her, yet the questions still ticked, </span>
<em>
<span>Is this enough? Will it be enough for him? </span>
</em>
<span>As the thoughts hovered in her mind her other hand drifted down to meet him. For the first time that day he was still and peaceful, as if he too had been soothed by Rio’s presence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was then that she felt it, a dull ache that started small and crept down into her back and around the curve of her stomach. She pressed her hand against the surface, finding it stiff and solid. The uncomfortable sensation along with the stillness of her son caused her heart to skip a beat. Her mind pricked with the memory of her miscarriage and she couldn’t help but feel a panic begin to rise in her chest. </span>
<em>
<span>Had all that movement earlier been a sign of distress? Was it happening again?</span>
</em>
<span> Feeling the pressure begin to soften she glided her hand over the surface until she found the spot he was pressed against. She dug her fingers into the spot attempting to spur some movement before she let fear overwhelm her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Everything alright, Cariño?” Rio asked, feeling her distress in the hand she was holding. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fine.” Agatha breathed as she waited for a sign that felt like it may never come. Then, just as the tears of doubt began to gather in the corners of her eyes, she felt a shift. A long rolling stretch that started small then spread across her abdomen, as if he was waking from a deep slumber only to quickly settle back under the covers. She let out a silent sigh of relief. He was alright, perfectly calm and content beneath her fingers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just as the final remnants of panic dissipated they pulled up to the restaurant. Rio drove the car around to the front and placed the vehicle in park. She got out and moved around to open Agatha’s door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know I’m perfectly capable of walking.” She snickered, trying to regain some of her poise after the startling incident. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Of course you are!” Rio brushed off the sarcasm with a smirk as she helped her out of the vehicle. “Go ahead, I’ll be in in a moment.” She rushed back around and moved to park the car. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha turned around and began to head inside, feeling more relieved with each step as  her son quickly resumed his jostling at her movements. As she sat and waited just inside the door for Rio she ghosted a hand over the swell, reveling in the life beneath it. “You scared me in there! Don’t do that!” she muttered, quietly as she could, “I thought I’d lost you!” she felt a twinge of grief in her chest at the admission and a rogue tear broke free from the corner of her eye. She hurried to wipe it away as she looked out the windows catching sight of Rio approaching. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright!” Rio beamed as she entered, “I don’t know about you two, but I am starving!” she said, pulling open the second set of doors for Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As they stepped into the restaurant they were greeted with a host of delectable smells wafting from the kitchen, a mix of grilled meats and roasted vegetables hung in the air. The space held an ambient amber glow that bounced off the wooden surfaces surrounding them. They were immediately handed menus and directed to join the line of people weaving up to the counter to order. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Have you been here before?” Rio asked excitedly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can’t say that I have.” Agatha replied curtly as she perused the menu</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I wound up here after a lengthy shift with a group of nurses when I first moved here. It’s been some of the best food I’ve had! I’ve been meaning to come back but hadn’t really thought of it until now. They have a little bit of everything so I figured they’d be able to accommodate whatever you might be craving.” Rio babbled nervously</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That was thoughtful.” Agatha hummed, not taking her eyes off the menu. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio could sense the unease that had followed them into the restaurant and wasn’t quite sure how to resolve it. After the night before she had been hopeful that all this awkwardness was behind them, but as she tried to engage Agatha further she continued to meet the resistance of walls that had seemingly reappeared overnight. Perhaps she was just hungry? Or hormonal? Either way, she was determined not to let Agatha’s prickliness dissuade her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“They…uh…they have a really good veggie burger, though last time I was here I got their Thai rice bowl. The peanut sauce is amazing!” Agatha hummed in acknowledgement but continued to scan the menu, flipping it over to peruse the drinks. “They do a lot of fresh juices and handcrafted sodas too. I’m for sure getting their ginger ale. It’s amazing!” Rio gushed hoping her excitement would damper the tension. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is that so?” Agatha lilted, her eyebrow hitched in amusement as a smirk tugged at the corner of her lips, her resolve waning further. Rio’s exuberance, the way she babbled nervously and enthusiastically, she couldn’t help but find her adorably endearing. As they reached the front of the line she felt Rio’s hand press against the small of her back, guiding her to the cashier. The touch was electric and grounding, a loving reassurance that Rio was again by her side, her mere existence somehow soothing the doubt she was struggling to reignite. Distracted by the touch she hadn’t noticed they were waiting on her to order until she heard Rio calling her name. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha? Do you still need a minute?” Rio asked gently</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No.” she breathed as she shook herself back into the present moment. “I’ll have whatever she ordered.” She decided abruptly as she slapped the menu on the counter. “I’m going to go find us a table.”  She sauntered off into the belly of the restaurant in search of a booth in the furthest back corner she could find to regroup.  </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“That’ll be $32.95” The cashier repeated, waiting for Rio’s acknowledgement.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“OH…yeah…right” She finally tore her eyes away from Agatha and fumbled around with her wallet. She quickly paid and gathered their drinks as she went in search of Agatha. Perhaps the night before had just been an appetizer for the deeper conversation they still needed to have? She knew it had only been the beginning as there was much to sort through and discuss, but she had hoped that the fiercest barriers had been crossed. Instead she was met with a dismissive coldness and lingering tension that was beginning to worry her. Not one to be discouraged, she pressed on and moved to join Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Here you are!” she hummed as she set the glass down in front of Agatha</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What is this?” she asked, observing the golden liquid adorned with mint and lime.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s the ginger ale.” Rio giggled as she took a sip of her drink. “Try it, I promise it’s delicious!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha at this point hated ginger, she had consumed so much of it over the last couple of months the smell of it alone made her gut wrench. Though not one to admit when she’d made a mistake, she leaned forward and took a confident gulp. She was immediately hit with a burst of ginger followed by a punch of the sour lime that caught in the back of her throat and she began to aspirate. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh my gosh, are you ok?” Rio jumped in alarm. “Shit, I should have grabbed some water too!” She leapt from the booth to remedy the mistake as Agatha continued to sputter. In desperation she took another sip of the ginger ale and grimaced, still sputtering. Luckily Rio returned speedily and she was able to clear the rest with a few gulps of water. Agatha wiped away the wetness from her eyes that had gathered in the coughing fit before finally turning her attention completely to Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Better?” Rio cooed, face still stitched with concern.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded silently and took another sip of water. As she set the glass down she felt her son shift dramatically in her stomach, kicking and pressing emphatically against the underside of her ribs. She winced at the uncomfortable sensation and guided a hand down to soothe the movements. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha?” Rio hummed nervously, she couldn’t let the tension simmer any longer</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hmmm?” Agatha breathed in reply</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed hard as she stared down into her drink. “How are you feeling about everything?” her voice sounded small as the words escaped her lips. She knew she was stepping into tender territory and it had taken all of her courage to do so.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha had known her bravado would only carry her so far, but she was still taken aback by Rio’s directness. Her lips opened and closed a few times, as if struggling to catch the words she wanted to say. In the end all that tumbled out was, “Conflicted.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I see.” Rio bit her lip nervously as she let the next question form, “Are you still upset with me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sat with the question for a moment, searching for the anger she had expected to still be simmering deep within her. Instead all that came to the surface were remnants of doubt and fear, wrapped around a knot of desire. She chewed on the question for a bit before finally responding. “No…I don’t think so.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio let out a small sigh of relief before bracing herself to dig further. After all, something was clearly still brewing between them. “I’m glad to hear that.” She breathed through a soft smile. “Is…is there something else the matter? I feel like I’m making you uncomfortable. I just…I know there's still a lot we should probably discuss. I’m sure you have questions, I certainly do! I just thought…maybe after last night…it’d be easier for us to talk about everything…but it kind of feels like you are trying to keep me at a distance.” Rio let out a nervous chuckle. “I…I know this isn’t going to be easy…for either of us…but I hope you can trust me enough to at least let me know what you’re thinking. I promise, unless you tell me to fuck off, I’m not going anywhere.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sat silently for a moment as she held Rio’s gaze, her burning amber irises chipping away at the cracks in her defenses. She swallowed her pride and through pursed lips dared to ask the question that was causing her so much hesitation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio blinked back in confusion. “Why?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, why? Why do you want any of this? You could have just as easily walked away. We haven’t even known each other a year!” she scoffed incredulously.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha, I love you. Why is that so hard for you to believe?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sure, you love me now! What about six months from now? Or a year from now, when things are far more complicated? ”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“More complicated than now?” Rio prodded with a smirk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know what I mean!” Agatha groaned exasperatedly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright I’ve got two veggie burgers!” The waiter interrupted in a disillusioned monotone as he set the plates down in front of them. “Anything else I can get you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m good, do you need anything?” Rio asked gleefully as she immediately took a bite of the sandwich. Agatha shook her head in reply, not taking her eyes off Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright, enjoy” The waiter muttered as he left them to finish their conversation. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sat silently, watching Rio eat as if they hadn’t just been in the middle of dissecting the very core of their relationship. Rio didn’t seem scared or put off by her questions, if anything she was relaxing further with each bite, more than comfortable to let the tension dangle between them for the time being. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have got to try this! I think this might be better than the Thai bowl!” Rio gushed through a mouthful of burger. Agatha couldn’t help but laugh at the adorable enthusiasm with which Rio ate as she resigned herself to the fact that this was going no further until they’d eaten. The first bite was hesitant as her mind was still focused on the conversation at hand, but that quickly changed as she began to devour the sandwich. She wasn’t sure if the burger was actually that good or if she was hungrier than she thought but she managed to finish everything before Rio was halfway through her meal. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I take it you enjoyed it?” Rio snickered as she took another bite. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned back in her seat, letting her hands rest on her stomach where her son was once again kicking happily within her. “Ok, I’ll admit that was pretty good.” she replied with a satisfied burp. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good! I’m glad you liked it!” Rio beamed, taking a sip of her drink before at last continuing with the conversation they had started. “I do know what you mean by the way.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, You do?” Agatha sighed, somewhat disappointed that the discussion had resumed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re afraid that I’m not in it for the long haul. That this is just some honeymoon phase and I’m going to dip when the baby comes? Is that it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“More or less.” She mumbled in agreement as she rubbed her hand against the swell. “I just…I don’t have the luxury of uncertainty anymore when it comes to us. If this continues you’re not just a part of my life, you’re a part of his. I have to be practical about this!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I can understand that, it’s just…I know you have feelings for me. You wouldn’t have kissed me the way you did last night if you didn’t. We wouldn’t be here right now if we both didn’t want this.” she smiled guiltily “You admitted it yourself, you love me! Are you really going to discount that?” Rio asked, her gaze unwavering as she peered deeply into Agatha’s eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha twisted her face in frustration. She had been so weak the night before and now it was coming back to bite her. “Ok, yes! I have feelings for you that could be described as love…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But…” Rio anticipated before the word left Agatha’s lips</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is it enough? I mean, there’s still so much we don’t even know about each other. Like, did you even want kids?” she chuckled exasperatedly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Always.” Rio breathed, setting down her food, “I just never dreamed I’d actually be in a position where that would be possible. Not to say that he’s mine, but to be a part of his life in any capacity would be a gift beyond my wildest dreams.” Rio reached her hand across the table, palm open in a pleading offering. “Agatha, I was serious when I said I wanted this, all of it. I want to be there for you, both of you, every step of the way, however you need me. I love you and if you feel the way I know you do about me we would be fools to not at least try to figure this out, right?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closed her eyes for a brief moment and searched for any reason left to deny what was all too clear at this point, but all she found was peace. Even her son had once again stilled his movements within her. They had been drawn together by fate, by destiny, perfectly formed to meet in this moment, two halves of a whole, finally finding each other again. She looked back into Rio’s searching gaze, her amber eyes filled with love and hope. Cautiously, Agatha raised a hand to the table and let her fingers settle in Rio’s palm. Rio’s words, her lingering touch as she held her hand atop the table dissolved the last of the fear Agatha had been holding onto. All that was left was the radiating warmth that Rio was pouring into her. A full, consuming love that she could no longer resist. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re right” she breathed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I am?” Rio gleamed with a cautious smile</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If this is really what you want?” Agatha emphasized</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“More than anything! Is…is this what you want?” Rio held her breath awaiting the final confirmation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha looked down as she felt a nudge in the stillness. “I think we both do.” she chuckled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is that so?” Rio asked as her smile broke free, relieved that she had at last overcome Agatha’s self-induced hurdles. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“He was being a menace all morning but has settled quite a bit since we’ve been talking. He did this earlier in the car too and it scared the shit out of me! For a second I thought something was wrong.” she chuckled</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why didn’t you say anything?” Rio asked, eyebrows stitched with concern.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It happened so quickly, just a flash of panic. It wasn’t </span>
<em>
<span>really </span>
</em>
<span>anything to worry about, I was…overthinking.” She waved her hand dismissively. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m glad, just try and clue me in in the future, even if you think it’s nothing to worry about. That’s part of my job now, to help make sure everything is ok.” Rio chuckled as she rubbed soothing circles on the back of Agatha’s hand with her thumb. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll try to keep that in mind.” Agatha snickered as she took a sip of her drink then grimaced, remembering it contained ginger as soon as the liquid hit her tongue. “Would this job of yours happen to include going to doctor's appointments?” she half-joked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Seriously?” Rio’s eyes grew wide in disbelief</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If you’re up for it, that is. It would be nice to have some company that isn’t Jen.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I… I would be honored!” Rio gasped dramatically, throwing a hand to her chest. “When?! When’s your next appointment? I’ll make sure to be there!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I think…” Agatha began to dig around in her purse for her phone. “Ugh! I can never find anything in this damn purse!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What are you looking for?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“My phone, I can’t remember if it’s next Wednesday or Thursday.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“This phone?” Rio asked, picking up the device that had been just beside her glass. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned in frustration as she took the phone from Rio. “Yes, thank you. Thursday, this coming Thursday at one.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll be there! Would you want to grab a bite beforehand?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t know if I’ll have time. I have a planning meeting until 12:30 and was going to head out after that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What if I pick you up? Bring you something to eat?” Rio offered</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh, that would be amazing! I was trying to figure out how to eat lunch at some point during that day!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Anything for you, my love!” She raised Agatha’s hand to her lips and pressed a kiss to her knuckles. “I know we both just devoured those burgers, but I could really go for some ice cream right about now and I may or may not have spotted a shop on the corner. You up for it?” Rio asked enticingly </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ice cream?” Agatha huffed a laugh as she felt an insistent nudge flutter under her ribs. “I think I could find some room for ice cream.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—----------------------------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The week had started rough, as Agatha had anticipated. Early Monday morning she said a teary goodbye to Ralph as he finally set off for his next contract. To show her appreciation she had sent him on his way with a new set of luggage and a pair of noise canceling headphones for the journey. It couldn’t begin to cover all he had done for her but it was something, a small token of her appreciation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she arrived at work she had been greeted with a hushed intensity as people hovered in groups sharing ominous whispers. She quickly learned, after interrogating Sharon, that Freddy had returned early that morning only to clean out his desk. Upon learning the sordid details of the affair, Herb along with HR had found his indiscretions irredeemable, and terminated his employment. When she had blurted out their secret relationship in anger she hadn’t expected it would lead to this. On one hand she was glad to be rid of the irritating pestilence of Freddy’s presence, on the other she and Herb were now stuck with the tasks he had been assigned for Mayfest, at least until they could figure out another solution. This meant another long week laden with meetings that all carried an undertone of anger and frustration. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With all this going on she was growing more grateful by the day that Rio was back in her life. Though she had been hesitant at first to rekindle their relationship, Rio was already showing just how devoted she was to making this work, despite her own hectic schedule. Rio had returned to work that Sunday but made sure to check in throughout each day. Knowing Monday would be stressful, she planned her break to meet Agatha for dinner after work and let her rant about the seemingly insurmountable tasks she was now undertaking. They quickly fell into a familiar routine. Though Agatha was usually stuck in one meeting or another, Rio would stop by, schmooze with Sharon and deliver some sort of treat for Agatha on her way to work. She returned to leaving Agatha voice memos when she got off in the wee hours of the morning telling her about her day, how much she couldn’t wait to see her, and how much she couldn’t wait for Thursday. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When the day finally arrived Agatha found herself cautiously optimistic about the appointment at hand. Though Jen had been kind enough to accompany her previously it had done nothing to quell the anticipatory anxiety of the check ups. In truth she dreaded these days. They always brought back memories of her miscarriage and she would hold her breath each time they dimmed the lights and turned on the ultrasound. She couldn’t help the fears that would hover in the back of her mind. </span>
<em>
<span>Would this be the time it would all fall apart? Would they tell her he's gone? Or that something was horribly wrong? </span>
</em>
<span>Then the sound of his heartbeat would echo out into the room, strong, steady, full of life. Only then would she allow herself to glance at the screen and finally breathe a sigh of relief at the impossible miracle growing inside her. The emotional rollercoaster this set her on was exhausting and given the week she was enduring she was relieved that Rio would be there. Her warm, grounding presence and abundant joy at having been asked to join was catching and Agatha couldn’t help but feel a bit excited as she headed into work that day. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The morning had been tedious. She and Herb had interviewed several potential replacements for Freddy, yet none seemed to quite fit the bill, especially with the relatively limited time frame they had. After the fifth objectively unfit candidate Agatha had had enough. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I swear if I have to sit and listen to one more person walk me through their TikTok strategies I’m going to scream! Herb, this is not what I signed up for!” She leaned back in the uncomfortably stiff armchair she had been sitting in for nearly two hours at this point and brought her hands up to rub at her temples. Her head was beginning to ache, her back twinged in discomfort, and her son was inconveniently perched on top of her bladder. She was at the end of her rope.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know! I’m sorry!” Herb groaned as he returned to the seat next to her. “I figured this might be difficult but not damn near impossible. I wouldn’t trust most of these people to run a dishwasher let alone our marketing campaign.” He slammed the folder of resumes he was holding down on the coffee table in front of them, and tossed his head against the back of the chair letting out a heavy sigh. “You know, I seriously considered waiting until after Mayfest to fire him.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why didn’t you?” Agatha groaned through gritted teeth.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, after HR sent me the footage I really had no choice.” He dropped his hands to his lap as he sat up further. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Footage?” She turned her head, eyebrow hitched in disgusted curiosity.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh yeah!” Herb chuckled “Not sure that I should really be sharing this but I know you can be discreet.” She sat up slowly, the air growing thick with suspense. “There were </span>
<em>
<span>several </span>
</em>
<span>incidents captured on our security cameras. If they had just been able to keep it off the premises he likely would have kept his job, but that was” His eyes flashed wide as he remembered the disturbing footage “fireable…to say the least.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mouth hung open as her nose scrunched in revulsion. “UGH! They were doing it here?!” she screeched</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know right? I don’t think I’ve ever been more appalled at someone’s behavior. I had to have a hazmat cleaning crew come in this past weekend to sanitize everything.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is that why this place has been reeking of lemons and bleach?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh yes! I had them clean top to bottom. I couldn’t bring myself to come in until that happened.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She stared off in horror for a moment before a disturbing thought entered her mind. “Where?” She murmured, unsure if she really wanted the answer to that question.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Herb’s eyebrows sprung in surprise as he bit his lip, seemingly considering how to answer. “Um…several…several locations.” He replied, his eyes darting around, avoiding her stare. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Herb, where?!” She insisted as a sinking feeling began to fill her chest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know…maybe it’s best if I don’t share all the details.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The conference room?” She couldn’t help but pry</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Trust me, you’ll appreciate the peace of mind!” he urged, hoping she would drop the line of questioning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not in the theatres?!” She insisted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Herb let out a resigned sigh “It would be easier to ask where it didn’t happen.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well not in here obviously!” she let out a chuckle which quickly dissipated as she caught Herb’s lack of amusement. Her eyes scanned the room gleaning with horror as she quickly sat up, removing as much of herself from the surfaces around her as she could. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t worry, they did the upholstery too.”  He huffed in amusement, seeing her disgust. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re right, maybe I don’t want to know! I knew they’d been having an affair, I didn’t realize…” she trailed off as she tried to block the images that were coming to mind.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, how did you know they were together?” Herb hunched over, leaning further in her direction.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How did you not?!” She scoffed “They were far too familiar to not be exploring each other's bodies! I figured it was inappropriate given their relative…positions. I had no idea any of </span>
<em>
<span>that </span>
</em>
<span>was happening!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I wish it hadn’t been happening! Then I wouldn’t have to be interviewing marketing managers while we should be planning for the biggest event we’ve ever hosted!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, do we have to hire someone now?” She whined in exhaustion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t know that we have another option!” Herb threw up his hand in surrender</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We could outsource it? Hire an agency for this event, then hire someone on a more permanent basis after this is all over.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Our budget may be larger this year but I don’t know that it could accommodate an agency.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Let me talk with finance, see where we’re netting out so far, we may have more wiggle room than we think, particularly since we won’t be paying a marketing manager for the next couple of months. If there is a gap I can reach out to some of my contacts, see who needs an early break on their taxes. I’d rather spend my time figuring that out than interviewing dozens more people.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Eh, you’re probably right. We still have a couple interviews scheduled for this afternoon. I’m happy to take them just in case one of them is a good fit. Why don’t you focus on sorting that out versus sitting in.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good plan! I bet I could have this figured out by tomorrow.” She bragged as she pulled herself from the chair. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I wouldn’t put it past you.” Herb beamed “You headed out?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I have my appointment at one, I should be back by 2:30 at the latest.” She assured as she made her way to the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do what you need to do. I’ll see you whenever you get back.” he said as he waved her off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—-------------------------------------------------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio had been giddy for the day since she had woken up early that morning. The whole week had led up to this. Agatha had granted her the opportunity to go with her to the obstetrics appointment and it felt like Christmas. She was going to get to see the child she had been worrying about for the better part of the last month and a half and the day couldn’t go by fast enough. So, she took herself on a long run, worked out vigorously in the school gym, got ready, did her laundry, cleaned her room and the kitchen all in an effort to make the time go by faster. </span>
</p><p>
<span>In the end she had planned it out perfectly, walking through the administrative doors at exactly 12:30. She strode down the long hallway, a bounce in her step as she rounded the corner and sidled up to Sharon’s desk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“There she is! How’s it going Sharon?” She greeted jovially, unwilling and unable to hide her enthusiasm. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh hi honey! Well don’t you look spiffy today!” Sharon praised as she stood to greet Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Big day Sharon! I had to look my best!” She turned in place modeling the outfit she had picked out. High waisted bell bottom jeans with a fitted black top tucked away under a cropped green blazer. Sleek, but casual enough to be comfortable. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well you certainly do! Are you excited?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You have no idea! You’d think I was the one having the baby!” That got a chuckle out of Sharon. “How’s she doing today?’</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“To be honest I haven’t seen much of her. She’s been in interviews with Herb all morning. I don’t think it’s going well.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is that for Freddy’s role?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh yes.” Sharon sang as she tried to hide a salacious grin at the mention of Freddy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ooo what’s that look for? You got some hot goss for me, Sharon?” She perched herself on the edge of Sharon’s desk as she anticipated the tea.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, you didn’t hear it from me, but apparently…” She looked around making sure no one was listening in, “the intern is pregnant.” she revealed in a not so hushed whisper.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“NO! You’re kidding!” Rio gasped, amused by the third party drama. “Where’d you hear that?!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Through the grapevine, of course! Aha-ha” Sharon chuckled. “Ah Ms. Harkness! I was just about to come grab you. How’d the interviews go?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“About as well as the last batch. I think I’ve finally convinced him it’ll be easier to hire an agency. At least for this project. Can you reach out to finance and find a time for me to talk with them this afternoon?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sure thing dear!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hi” she breathed with a tired smile, at last turning her attention to Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hello, Cariño!” Rio beamed as she took Agatha’s hand and placed a kiss to her knuckles. “Are you ready?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Almost, I just have to drop my stuff off in my office and grab my purse.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Excellent! I’ll go pull the car around and meet you out front.” Rio hopped up from Sharon’s desk and placed another soft kiss to Agatha’s cheek before she hurried out the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh she is a keeper!” Sharon gushed as soon as Rio was out of ear shot. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Charming, isn’t she!” Agatha agreed as she glanced back to where Rio had sauntered off before returning her things and grabbing her bag. “I should be back around 2:30. If anything comes up before then call me.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m sure we’ll manage until then. You two have fun now!” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>—————————————————-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As soon as the car door closed behind her Agatha let out a heavy sigh. She was relieved to finally be away from the stress of work but now she had to prepare herself to endure this appointment. A familiar panic was already pressing into her chest as she sorted through the bag of food Rio had brought her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hope I got the right thing. I went to that sandwich place you like. Made sure to grab an extra pickle.” Rio flashed her a caring smile as she turned onto the next street. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As she unfurled the sandwich her mouth began to water. It had been exactly what she was craving and she didn’t waste any time devouring it. “This is perfect! Thank you!” She mumbled through a mouthful as she rested her head against the headrest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You doing alright?” Rio asked, seeing her clear exhaustion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Eh? I’ll be fine. It’ll be so much easier once we figure out all this marketing shit. It’s taken so much more time and energy than I would have liked.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It sounds like you might have figured out a solution. Will you get to catch a break once this is resolved?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not a break but at least this weight will be off my shoulders. There’s a list a mile long that keeps getting longer as we waste time sorting through this mess that I’ll have to push through first until I can carve out some time.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That sounds stressful! Is there anyone besides Herb helping you?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sharon’s been a lifesaver but until we decide on a management company it’s all kind of on my plate. That of course has taken a back seat while we sort through this disaster. Oh! You are not going to believe what Herb told me today about </span>
<em>
<span>why</span>
</em>
<span> he had to fire Freddy!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is it because he got the intern pregnant?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?! No! Where did you hear that?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sharon was telling me when I was waiting for you. Yeah, apparently he knocked her up!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“At this point that doesn’t surprise me! I guess HR found footage of them hooking up at the office!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ew! What the fuck?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s what I said! If I didn’t like that man before I fucking despise him now! What kind of disgusting pervert does that?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sounds like his time to go was long overdue.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re telling me!” She scoffed as she bit into the extra pickle. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How’s the little man doing today? You excited to see him again?” Rio asked as she reached over to rest her hand on Agatha’s thigh. Her warm touch soothing the anxiety that was simmering inside her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“He seems to be taking a break from his usual antics and has parked himself on my bladder. I’m guessing he’s just tired after keeping me up half the night swimming around in there. I’m looking forward to checking in on him but I’ll be excited when this is over. I hate doctors' offices.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I can’t blame you, most of the time they’re dismal places, but this should be fun.” she moved her hand to take Agatha’s “Thanks for inviting me, I’ve been looking forward to it all week!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha melted into the connection, letting Rio’s joy and exuberance squash the fears she kept at bay and replaced them with peace and safety. “I’m glad you’re here.” she hummed as Rio’s thumb rubbed calming circles on the back of her hand. Finally full and at ease, she let her head drift back to settle on the headrest as her eyes fluttered closed for what she told herself would only be a moment. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As they pulled up to the clinic twenty minutes later Rio looked over to find Agatha still sound asleep. She grabbed a parking spot up near the door and quietly turned off the car. She paused for a moment, taking in the sleeping form beside her. If it was possible she was somehow even more beautiful now, wrapped in slumber. Her eyes pressed closed so her lashes danced along her flushed cheeks. Her rosy lips were curled in a dreamy bliss as her chest rose and fell with each languid breath. She seemed so at peace Rio hated to wake her from this rest she so clearly needed. She waited as long as she could before finally reaching a hand over, tucking a piece of hair behind her ear before cupping her face in her hand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“My love…” she cooed, easing Agatha from her nap “We’re here, it’s time to go in.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha breathed in a sharp inhale as her eyes sprung open. “We’re here?” she groaned as she stretched, trying to bring herself to consciousness as quickly as possible. “Sorry about that, I didn’t mean to fall asleep.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No worries! I’m glad you had a chance to rest. You ready?” Agatha nodded. Rio grinned then hurled herself out of the car and ran around to collect Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you going to do this everywhere we go?” Agatha smirked as Rio helped her from the vehicle. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Of course! I always strive to provide elite service. It’s why I'm rated five stars in the app.” Rio replied with the utmost sincerity.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What app?” Agatha couldn’t help but laugh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Let me see your phone.” Agatha handed over the phone and watched Rio suspiciously as she tapped away.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Here!” She turned the device around to reveal she had added five green stars after her name in Agatha’s contacts. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>This tickled Agatha to the point that she was snorting laughing. “That is so stupid! I love it!” She leaned over and pressed a quick kiss to Rio’s lips. “Come on rockstar, we better head inside.” She couldn’t help but grin as she closed the door behind her. For the first time since she had discovered him she headed inside to her appointment, Rio’s hand in her’s, her heart filled with joy and excitement for what was coming next. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>—--------------------------------------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Once she had checked in they were quickly settled into a room. One of the nurses drew some blood and took her vitals before leaving them to wait for Dr. Allen. Agatha sat at the edge of the exam table, more relaxed than she had been in the past, but being in the room now, even with Rio, still made her uneasy. Rio, on the other hand, was pacing in the corner, her body unable to contain the nervous excitement she held. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re going to wear a hole in the floor if you keep pacing like that.” Agatha huffed as she picked at her nail beds. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stopped her pacing abruptly. “Sorry, just a bit nervous.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>You’re</span>
</em>
<span> nervous? What for?” Agatha scoffed</span>
<span>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know. This kind of feels like a big moment, like I’m meeting him for the first time, ya know.” Rio shrugged</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha cracked a smile at the admission as she reached out her hand, beckoning Rio close to take it. “No need to worry, I’m sure you’ll make a good impression.” She tilted her head to meet Rio’s lips in a kiss just as a knock sounded at the door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha, how are we doing today?” Dr. Allen greeted as she entered, her attention focused on the papers in her hand as she closed the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Doing alright, he’s still not letting me sleep through the night. Dr. Allen this is…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh! Dr. Vidal! What a pleasant surprise!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Dr. Allen! Good to see you again.” Rio greeted with a tentative wave.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Of course you two know each other! I should have figured.” Agatha rolled her eyes</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh yes! Fortunately I don’t have to rely on her expertise too often. Glad to have you with us. So, you ready to take a look at your little one?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha felt a cold rush of nerves fall down her spine “Sure, yeah. Let’s do this.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ok, go ahead and get comfortable.” Dr. Allen instructed as she flipped off the lights. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned back, the paper crinkling beneath her as she adjusted. She pulled up the hem of her shirt exposing the swollen mound of her child to the frigid clinical air causing goosebumps to prickle down her limbs. She shivered at the sensation as her arms dropped to her sides, her hands clenching into bracing fists, holding back the anxiety that simmered just below the surface as Dr. Allen readied the machine and applied the ultrasound jelly. She chewed at the corner of her mouth as her mind ping ponged between </span>
<em>
<span>what if something’s wrong</span>
</em>
<span> and </span>
<em>
<span>no, everything’s fine</span>
</em>
<span> while trying desperately to just focus on taking calm breaths. As her feet began to rock in worry she felt a warm hand brush against her clenched fist, coaxing it open, allowing enough room for Rio’s fingers to be held. A point of grounding, calling her to stillness with that ever radiating warmth. This was soon echoed by a touch at her shoulder along with the soothing sounds of Rio’s steady breath at her ear. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned to take in Rio who had pulled up a chair and was resting her chin on her arm at the edge of the table. Her honey amber eyes met Agatha’s with glowing adoration, as if she was taking in the whole world before her in this moment. Her lips held a restrained smirk, as if trying and failing to mask the excitement that was electrifying every cell in her body. It was infectious, Rio’s joy, her unmitigated elation at being here in this moment with her. She could feel her heart begin to flutter, not in fear, not in worry, but in gleeful anticipation at seeing her son.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Lost in Rio’s gaze and caring touch, she’d hardly noticed Dr. Allen had started until Rio’s eyes darted past her. Illuminated by the glowing light of the screen she could see Rio’s face shift from adoration to awe at the sight before her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“There he is!” it was spoken like she had discovered a holy relic, with reverence and wonder as she lifted her head to get a better view. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha broke her gaze and turned to see the miracle that was her son. His little profile was on full display giving view to the tiniest button nose above what was unmistakably Agatha’s puckered lips. His precious hand hovered by his chin as it opened and closed, almost as if he was waving at them. Then, at last, the strong whooshing sound of his heartbeat rang out into the room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Look at him! He’s perfect!” Rio breathed shakily, unable to contain her veneration. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha felt Rio’s grip tighten around her hand and turned back to see silent glistening tears had started to stream down her face. She was biting at her lip in a weakening attempt to hold herself together and as she glanced back down at Agatha her composure broke as an incredulous chuckle burst forth. Rio leaned forward and pressed a kiss to Agatha’s cheek, which was now drenched in her own tears, before pulling away to grab them both tissues. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I will say, everything seems to be progressing nicely. He’s measuring to be right where we want him as we enter into the third trimester. Strong heartbeat, lots of movement and overall seems happy and content. Let me just grab a few shots here while he’s cooperating for us…” Dr. Allen clicked about for a few more moments before turning off the device and cleaning the goo from Agatha’s stomach as Rio helped her to sit up. “So, little one is in the clear, now tell me about how you’re doing. I know you mentioned you were having trouble sleeping, anything else you’re experiencing?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, really I’m just sore and tired all the time. I have had some occasional, I guess you could call it cramping?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hmmm…ok, are you experiencing any bleeding or spotting with it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, nothing like that. It’s just uncomfortable for a bit then goes away pretty quickly.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s likely Braxton Hicks, you’ll probably feel them more frequently as you settle into the third trimester and we get closer to the due date. Though if anything changes or you do experience any bleeding, don’t be afraid to reach out.” She gave Agatha a reassuring smile before glancing over her chart as she continued her questioning, “How are you managing stress these days? I know when we first met there was a lot going on and this had come as a bit of a shock. Last time you mentioned work has become a little more demanding but it would be somewhat temporary. Have things settled at all?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha breathed a laugh, “Not exactly, though the shock has worn off a bit.” She flashed a nervous glance to Rio who was standing holding her hand and leaning against the table beside her. “For the most part things in my personal life are beginning to come together a bit more.” She felt Rio squeeze her hand and she responded in kind. “Work, on the other hand, is another story. I had hoped things would calm down earlier this week but due to some recent changes that hasn’t been the case. If anything it’s gotten more complicated.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good! I’m glad to hear some things have settled. I’m sorry to hear work hasn’t eased up yet. Other than work and difficulty sleeping, is there anything else you would say contributes to stress in your life currently?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, not that I can th…oh, well I wouldn’t say I’m stressed about it, more moderately annoyed, but technically, I guess my mother </span>
<em>
<span>is </span>
</em>
<span>suing me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?!” Rio shouted, her eyes bulging in shocked fury as she glared at Agatha.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did I forget to mention that?” She asked as an amused smirk crept across her face</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Uh, yeah! I feel like I would have remembered that!” Rio laughed, dispersing the anger that sparked inside her at the mention of Evanora. “We can talk about it later.” she snickered as they turned their attention back to Dr. Allen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wow, yeah, that’s definitely not going to help anything!” Dr. Allen let out a sympathetic laugh. “With everything that you’re managing it’s important that, as things progress, you continue to rest and relax as much as possible. Make sure you’re eating enough, drinking enough water, and not over exerting yourself. Overall you’re in good shape, the only thing I’m currently concerned about is that your blood pressure is still higher than I’d like it to be. We’re going to continue to monitor it closely for now, though if it hasn’t decreased by your next visit we may look at prescribing something.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is this something we should be monitoring at home?” Rio jumped in, growing worried at the concern.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Dr. Allen cracked a smile, “Great minds! I was just about to suggest checking a few times throughout the day. It will also help us see if you are experiencing any spikes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How concerned should I be about this?” Agatha asked, seeing the growing worry from the two professionals in the room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Right now it's just something to be aware of, in the sense that you should do what you can to eliminate as much stress as possible. That, to me, seems to be the likely contributing factor as you appear pretty healthy otherwise and baby is doing great.” She gave Agatha an encouraging smile. “Do you have any other questions for me?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No I don’t think so.” She took another glance back at Rio whose caring smile had grown to hold a twinge of concern. “Do you?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio gleamed at the question “No, I’m good.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright, I’ll have the photos up at the front for you when you make your next appointment. You’re all set here, y’all enjoy the rest of your day.” Dr. Allen left with a wave and a kind smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio helped Agatha down from the table and grabbed her purse as Agatha straightened herself and led them out to the front desk. Rio followed in a haze, the last few minutes had been life changing. Though she had seen several ultrasounds throughout her career, it was a completely different experience being on this side of the table. The amazement she held at seeing the child that had turned her world upside down was indescribable, and yet fear bloomed at the back of her mind. She couldn’t let anything happen to Agatha and she would do everything in her power to ensure it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—------------------------------------------------</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as she settled back into the car Agatha let out the breath she didn’t realize she had been holding, her body relaxing into the plush seats of Rio’s SUV. “I’m so glad that’s over!” she groaned as she buckled herself in. “Thanks again for coming with me.” she said, turning to Rio as she reached her hand to rest on her thigh.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thank you for inviting me, Cariño.” she smiled, leaning over the center console, taking in Agatha’s lips for a kiss. “This has been the second best day of my life.” she leaned in for another kiss. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Second best?” Agatha asked, grinning through pressed lips</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The best was when I met you, of course!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, breaking the kiss. “You really can’t help it can you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can’t help what?” Rio asked innocently</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Being this obscenely charming!” Agatha exclaimed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio gasped in mock astonishment “You think I’m charming? And I thought this day couldn’t get any better!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes and chuckled as she opened the envelope containing her photos. She could feel her heart swell at the sight of her son as she began to sort through the pictures. Rio hovered at her side reviewing the images as she flipped through one by one. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“He’s going to look just like you.” Rio chuckled as they got to the image of him waving</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How do you know?” Agatha asked, eyebrow raised </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well he’s got your mouth for sure, and I’m pretty sure he’s making that face in the photo.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span> “You can’t tell that!” She laughed, eyebrow arching further in skepticism</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“There! Right there! I swear, it’s the same exact face!” Rio insisted as she giggled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I guess we’ll have to wait and see!” Agatha laughed as she flipped through the rest of the photos. “It looks like some of these are the same, doesn’t it?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio looked closer over Agatha’s shoulder. “Yeah, those are definitely the same. These too.” she said pointing out the duplicates.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh…well…then, do you want to take some?” Agatha offered, her eyes darting questioningly to Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I…uh…well…yeah” Rio sputtered as her face began to flush. “I mean if there are extras…and you don’t mind. Yeah I… I’d love to take some.” She beamed as Agatha handed over the second set. “Wow! This is…this is really happening!” Rio breathed in awe as she looked through the photos Agatha had handed her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sat, observing the elated reverence Rio held looking at her son. It was the kind of love and adoration she could have only dreamed of growing up with Evanora. As she thought of the life she wished for her son she couldn’t imagine depriving him of someone who already loved him more than her own mother ever did. It pulled at something deep within her, a phantom of guilt and fear at how close she had been to throwing this all away. It washed over her in a wave of cold panic causing her to reach her hand across the console, cupping Rio’s cheek as she pulled her lips into hers as her fingers wound through her hair. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio moaned into the kiss with delighted surprise. She pressed forward as her hand came up to clutch at Agatha’s wrist. The smell of lilac and honeysuckle invaded her airways, deepening her hunger, causing her to press her tongue into Agatha’s mouth, chasing the heavenly taste she had craved for so long. As Agatha whimpered into her mouth Rio moved her hands to cup her face, feeling a wetness on her fingertips as a saltiness began to mix with the sweetness of Agatha’s flavor. Worried, Rio leaned back, abruptly breaking their connection. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you ok? What’s wrong?” She panted as she scanned Agatha’s tear stained face. Her ocean blue eyes almost teal in contrast to the redness surrounding them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded as she caught her breath. “I’m fine. I promise.” She huffed as a weak smile broke through the tears. “I think…I think it’s just the hormones. It’s also been a hell of a day.” She leaned back in her seat brushing the wetness from her eyes. “Come on, I should probably get back to work anyway.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“About that…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Given what Dr. Allen said, maybe it’s a good idea for you to take the afternoon off.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“HA!” Agatha burst out a laugh “You’re joking!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha, you just said it yourself, it’s already been a rough day. You’ve been working like crazy for weeks, on your own. I think you’ve earned it.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I can’t just take the afternoon off, I have to save vacation days for when the baby comes. Besides, I’m supposed to meet with finance to figure out a plan for this marketing thing!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“First, it’s barely half a day, they probably wouldn’t even count it against you. You and I both know Herb wouldn’t question it. Second, does the finance thing really need to happen </span>
<em>
<span>today</span>
</em>
<span>? Maybe Sharon could push it to tomorrow? Knowing you I bet you’d still have it resolved before noon.” Agatha narrowed her eyes at her in consideration but said nothing. Rio picked up the sonogram of the baby waving and held it up next to her face, “He says </span>
<em>
<span>Please mommy! Please blow off work this afternoon and hang out with Rio instead</span>
</em>
<span>!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha raised her eyebrows in amusement, “Are you seriously using my son to guilt me into skipping work?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Only if it’s working.” She glanced at the photo then back at Agatha. “Is it working?” She laughed nervously. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked as she pulled out her phone. “I’ll call Sharon, if she can find a time tomorrow morning for me to meet with them then I’ll take the afternoon off.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Excellent! Let me talk to her!” Rio demanded as Agatha called Sharon. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha asked as the phone rang. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Here, put it on speaker!” She held out her hand as Agatha handed over the phone and Rio adjusted just in time for Sharon to answer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Hello dear! How did it go?” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Everything was fine!” Agatha replied </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Everything was not fine Sharon!” Rio shouted towards the phone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Is that Rio? Hi honey!”</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hi, yes it’s Rio! Agatha’s not coming back to work today, doctor's orders, she needs to reschedule her money meeting for tomorrow morning.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Oh, ok! I hope it’s not too serious! You know, that might work out better actually. I was only able to grab 30 minutes right at 2:30 today and I wasn’t sure if that was going to be enough time.” </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“See! Tomorrow’s better!” Rio taunted as Agatha rolled her eyes. “She’ll be fine, just needs to rest a bit. Thanks Sharon! You’re the best!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, thank you Sharon. I’ll see you tomorrow.” Agatha said as she hung up the phone. “So, now what?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Now, we chill.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And what does chilling involve?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Anything you want! We could head back to your place, hang out with Scratchy and relax on the couch. Or we can head to my place. See what they have playing in the theatre, maybe go for a swim? Though, at some point, we should stop at a store and try and get a blood pressure monitor.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“A swim?” Agatha chuckled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah why not? It’d probably feel good if you're sore. Besides, no one ever uses the pool, especially on a Thursday afternoon. I’m sure we’d have the place to ourselves.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Now that you mention it, that does sound nice, though, I don’t know if I have anything to wear that still fits at this point.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How about this, we run to your house, you can grab what you need, I’m sure we can find something that’ll work, then we can stop at the store on the way to my place?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, that sounds like a plan.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hell yeah! This is going to be great!” Rio cheered as she turned the car on. “Much better than stressing out over work stuff! Bleh!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re a terrible influence!” Agatha chuckled</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, but I’m your terrible influence.” Rio smirked as she pulled out of the lot and headed to Agatha’s house. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—————————————————</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Hours later Agatha emerged from the pool locker room in a sports bra and a pair of swimsuit bottoms that she managed to squeeze into with her hair twisted up into a large bun on the top of her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I look like a beach ball!” She called out to Rio who was already swimming around gleefully. “I can’t believe you talked me into this!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re the cutest beach ball I’ve ever seen!” Rio lilted as she swam to meet her at the shallow end of the pool. “Come on, the water feels great!” Rio stood at the edge of the stairs and reached a hand out for Agatha to join her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha hovered at the edge of the pool, chewing at the side of her lip, bracing herself for the cold shock of the water. She eased onto the first step and was surprised to find it was warmer than she expected, almost tepid like a bath, immediately soothing the swollen aching in her feet. Her eyes fluttered closed sighing at the relief. As she lowered herself further she felt the tension she had accumulated throughout the day begin to lessen, melting into the water around her. As she neared the final steps she took Rio’s hand and let her guide them deeper into the pool. As the water crested their hips Rio sank down, pulling Agatha into her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Let go, I’ve got you.” She murmured as her arms tucked under her shoulders. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha let out another deep sigh as the weight and pressure she had been feeling in her back and hips lifted. She wrapped her arms around Rio’s shoulders as she rested her forehead against hers, collapsing the rest of her weight into Rio as she let herself be dragged through the water. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Feeling better, my love?” Rio hummed as Agatha’s head sank further onto her shoulder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mmhmmm” Agatha sighed as she felt her spine begin to decompress. “This feels amazing! I feel like I can breathe again.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio pressed a kiss to Agatha’s temple as she continued walking them around the pool. After a while they drifted over to the edge and Rio propped herself against the wall. Agatha stirred as their motion came to a stop, her feet catching on the bottom of the pool as she moved to stand, arms still wrapped loosely around Rio’s neck. Her eyes, now heavy in relaxed bliss, slowly blinked Rio back into focus. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You still with me, Cariño?” Rio chuckled, seeing the tiredness in her crystal blue eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Just barely.” Agatha yawned “I don’t remember the last time I felt this relaxed. This is exactly what I needed.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, “I had a feeling this might do the trick.” She let her gaze fall down to the bump pressed between them as her hands rose to rest on either side. “And how about you pequeño bichito? Are you relaxed? Happy?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I think he’s asleep! He’s just kind of sitting right here.” Agatha moved Rio’s right hand just below her belly button. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“AH! I see, sleep all day and keep mama up at night! We can’t have that now can we!” Rio leaned forward, pressed her lips firmly to where her hand had just been and blew a raspberry against the taught flesh vibrating Agatha’s entire stomach. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha yelped and jumped back in surprise, before devolving into a fit of laughter. “What was that for?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio gleamed at the sound of Agatha’s joy, “Just trying to wake him up. Did it work?”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped forward, resuming her position between Rio’s legs and placed her hand back at the spot. “You tell me” she chuckled as the waves of laughter faded.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As soon as Rio’s hand made contact she could feel the strumming of life she had awakened beneath Agatha’s skin. “Ha!” An astonished laugh burst forth from Rio’s throat as her eyes jumped up take in Agatha’s surprised amusement. “Well,” she shrugged “Maybe now he’ll let you sleep through the night!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“One can only hope!” Agatha sighed as she moved to lean against the wall next to Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As soon as she was settled Rio turned her head abruptly with a mischievous glint in her eye. “Hey, you want to see a cool trick?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled as her eyebrows stitched in amusement. “A cool trick?” Rio nodded excitedly “Sure, as long as I don’t have to move.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not at all! You’re perfect right where you are!” Rio replied, planting a kiss on Agatha’s cheek as she pushed herself away from the wall, easing through the water, grinning like a crocodile. She swam to the other side of the pool and pushed herself out onto the ground. Dripping as she walked she headed towards the set of diving boards at the far end. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Please don’t hurt yourself! I’m in no condition to try and save you!” Agatha called across the room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I promise I’ll be safe!” Rio shouted back as she ascended one of the ladders. She walked halfway down the board, gave Agatha a wave, then zeroed in her focus to the task at hand. With the grace of a champion athlete she stepped out, sprang once, twice then leapt off the board clearing two and a half rotations before her hands hit the water in a near perfect dive. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sat, mouth hung ajar, gobsmacked at what she had just witnessed. As the water bubbled just below where Rio had disappeared her eyes searched for her to resurface. A moment passed, then another, then finally Rio’s head breached the water just a few feet away from where she was standing. “What the hell was that?” Agatha shrieked in outraged amazement. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Just a 2.5. Cool trick right?” Rio beamed as she came to float in front of Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Where did that come from?” Agatha half shouted, still in shock</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I was on the diving team through undergrad. I wasn’t very good but I had a good time.” Rio shrugged as she waded back and forth in the water. “What can I say? I’m full of surprises!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll say! What else don’t I know about you?” She asked, narrowing her eyes in delighted suspicion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, lots! But I can’t go giving away all my secrets at once, now can I?! Where would be the fun in that?” Rio cackled, delighted in her obstinance. “Come on, now it’s your turn.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“My turn? I’m not jumping off that thing!” Agatha scowled at the suggestion</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, not for the diving board. What’s something I don’t know about you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I think you know the most interesting bits about me. I don’t have any cool tricks up my sleeve.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright, then tell me what’s going on with your mother.” Rio challenged with the tilt of her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s face dropped in annoyance. “Seriously?” Rio nodded, “Man, you really know how to kill a mood!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Unless there’s another interesting tidbit you’d like to share with the class?” Rio shrugged</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fine! She’s suing me.” Agatha replied abruptly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, you mentioned that.” Rio snickered,  “For what? When?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She’s trying to get the house. Allegedly she has some sort of amended will and she’s going to drag me into court to try and prove it and I can’t sell the house until this gets dismissed. As to when, not sure yet, I’m still waiting to hear back from my lawyer about a date, but she’s hoping to get it set for early to mid April.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you two even allowed to be in the same room? I thought you had that restraining order against her!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned and rolled her eyes. “Well, she got that appealed. Claimed there wasn’t enough evidence to prove any abuse or stalking.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck! I knew we should have pressed charges!”  Rio growled as she smacked the water around her. “Are you sure you’ll be up for it? You don’t need any more aggravation or stress.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh I’m fine, this is just another in a long series of stunts she likes to pull to try and get my attention. My lawyer’s convinced we’ll get it dismissed quickly and then I can move on and finally sell the damn house. I’m just ready for it to all be over.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, let me know when it’s set for and I’ll make sure I’m available.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You don’t have to do that. I can handle my mother.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, I have no doubt about that! But, given the circumstances and my own personal grievances, I’m willing to make the sacrifice of my time to face that </span>
<em>
<span>cunt</span>
</em>
<span>!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio!” Agatha scolded</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sorry, but I fucking despise that woman!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Believe me I understand! Just promise me you won’t give her the satisfaction of rattling you.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t worry, I’ll keep my composure! I’m just not going to let her get away with pulling any shit! If she so much as raises a finger in your direction, you better believe I’m going to handle it!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Despite my better judgment, it </span>
<em>
<span>would</span>
</em>
<span> be nice to have you there.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, I’ll be there!” Rio waded forward to stand in front of Agatha, her hands coming to rest on either side of her. “I’m not going to risk anything happening to you!” She leaned forward pressing a kiss to Agatha’s waiting lips. It was brief but burned with desire. She pulled back, her darkening eyes darting between Agatha’s before sinking back into the water, “to either of you” she murmured as she pressed a kiss to the swell of Agatha’s belly, eyes still gazing up at her, heated and longing. </span>

<span>Agatha could feel her heart stutter in her chest as she gazed down at Rio. Even here, damp in the cool ambient light of the natatorium, Rio was undeniably stunning. Her honey amber eyes glowing up at Agatha like gas lamps flickering in pitch darkness, her raven hair hovering in the water around her. As Rio rose back up out of the water, she could feel her breath catch in her throat at the sight. The way droplets were streaming down the fit rippling curves of her body, it sparked something insatiable deep within her bringing a flush to her cheeks. She shook her head, attempting to dispel the lustful thoughts now invading her mind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are…are you getting hungry?” Agatha choked out through a surprisingly dry mouth as Rio stepped closer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The corner of Rio’s lips twitched in desire. “</span>
<em>
<span>Ravenous</span>
</em>
<span>!” She growled as she surged forward, wasting no time, consuming Agatha’s lips as if they were her last meal. Her hands wandered down, finding purchase on Agatha’s hips as her fingers dug into the pillowy flesh eliciting a moan. Spurred on by the sound, her hands descended further cupping the underside of Agatha’s ass, inviting a leg to rise and wrap around her as her own pressed into the space between. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha whimpered as Rio’s teeth bit enticingly at her bottom lip, her eyebrows stitching together in release and surrender at the pressure between her legs. She chased the taste of Rio’s lips, raising her arms to wrap around her neck and pressing further into her causing them to drift away from the wall. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stepped back clumsily as her arms flew out to the sides attempting to catch them both. This worked for a moment but as they floated deeper into the water Rio’s foot lost contact with the bottom of the pool and they quickly dipped below the surface, only breaking apart once they were fully submerged. They resurfaced quickly, sputtering and coughing as they each regained their composure, eventually devolving into a fit of laughter as they caught each other's gaze. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sorry, lost my balance!” Rio coughed as the remaining liquid left her lungs</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, please! I practically pushed you under!” Agatha snorted as she wiped the water away from her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You can push me under anytime!” Rio lilted as she swam to stand behind Agatha, her hands resuming their position on her hips as she peppered kisses down her neck. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed into the touch, feeling desire reignite within her almost instantly. “</span>
<em>
<span>Rio…</span>
</em>
<span>” she moaned, struggling to regain her focus.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, my love?” Rio murmured as she nibbled the lobe of her ear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Shouldn’t we…</span>
</em>
<span>” She breathed as she felt Rio’s hand roam down around her thigh, fingers toying with the hem of her swimsuit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Yes, my love?</span>
</em>
<span>” She hummed against the shell of her ear as her fingers pressed against fabric at the heat of Agatha’s core. Her other hand rose to clutch her breast, releasing a fountain of water that had been trapped in the bra. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As Agatha let out a delicious moan they heard the locker doors slam shut behind them. They both abruptly turned to find a portly elderly man with a large hairy gut waddling out of the men’s locker room, unaware of the moment he had so rudely interrupted. Rio immediately released her grip on Agatha who gasped at the sudden loss. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t know about you, but I’m beginning to feel a little pruny. You wanna get out of here?” Rio called to Agatha as she swam backwards towards the stairs. Flustered by the heat that was somehow still building within her, Agatha could only nod vigorously at the suggestion and began to follow Rio out of the pool. They grabbed their towels and moved silently into the locker room. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, seemingly unfazed by the abrupt end to their rendezvous, calmly gathered her clothes and stripped out of her wet suit to change. Agatha stood, wrapped in a towel, gaze transfixed on Rio, her perky nipples pebbling in the cool air as she slid on a tank top that hung close to her damp skin. Her mouth hung open, drool pooling in the corner as Rio bent over to slip on her thong, her pussy peeking through the gap at the intersection of her ass and thighs. If her desire for the woman had been burning before it was now raging like a wildfire, melting her from the inside out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As she slipped on her pants Rio turned to find Agatha frozen, a look of dumbfounded lust etched across her face. She smirked as she sauntered up to her, “You going to change? Or are you going to </span>
<em>
<span>drip </span>
</em>
<span>all the way back up to the apartment?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The question broke Agatha from her hypnosis. “I…uh…yes…yeah.” She stuttered as she stumbled to gather her things to change. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So, what’s the plan?” Rio asked as she slid onto the sink counter to wait for Agatha. “Do you want to hang out here for a bit or do you need to head back?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That depends,” Agatha replied as she struggled to pull the wet top up and over her head. “What time is it?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Just after 6:30.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh,” she felt her stomach drop at the realization of how late it already was. “Then I should probably head back, I’ll need to shower and feed Scratchy.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You should probably eat something too.” Rio encouraged</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes that too.” she replied as she slipped into the pair of sweatpants she brought. “Are you…what are you…do you have plans?” she stammered, trying to find a way to suss out Rio’s intentions without assuming. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m yours for as long as you’ll have me.” Rio snickered</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh…good!” Agatha sighed, relieved, before realizing how desperate it may have sounded. “I mean, if you’d like to come over…that would be nice.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wouldn’t it though!” Rio beamed as she jumped from the counter. “We’ll still need to run upstairs to grab my keys and the rest of your things. Should I…plan to grab anything else?” She asked, raising her brows suggestively as she looked Agatha over. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What…whatever you think you’ll need.” Agatha stuttered as Rio approached her once again, a predatory grin stretched across her face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright, then we better get going, don’t want to keep Scratchy waiting.” Rio stated as she breezed by Agatha, smacking her ass on her way to grab the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—-------------------------------------------</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They moved as quickly as Agatha’s pregnant body would allow back up to the apartment. In a flurry Rio ran around and grabbed her keys, Agatha’s things, and threw together a bag of her own items before ushering them hurriedly back out the door. As they made their way out to the car Agatha stopped suddenly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Shit! My car is still downtown!” she gasped in frustration.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you need it?” Rio chuckled as she opened Agatha’s door</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I…I guess not. If you don’t mind…” Agatha mumbled as she settled into the vehicle.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Of course not!” Rio interjected, leaning in to press a kiss to Agatha’s lips before enclosing her in the vehicle. Rio moved around, throwing their items in the back seat before hopping in and setting off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As they drove Rio turned on a jazz playlist and began humming along to Ella Fitzgerald’s silky melodies. Her right hand wandered across the console and settled on Agatha’s thigh as her fingers tapped along to the music. Each delicate press was like blowing on the embers of Agatha’s desire, sending sparks of electricity throughout her. It was unbearable, having Rio so close but not quite where her body craved her most and they still had a ways to go before they made it to her house. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She crossed her legs, taking Rio’s hand in her’s to ease her suffering. Without looking Rio brought Agatha’s hand up to her mouth and pressed her lips to the knuckles. Agatha sucked in sharply at the sensation of Rio’s warm breath on her fingers. At the sound Rio turned to grin seductively at Agatha, her lips never parting from her hand, as her glowing eyes flickered in the light of the setting sun. Agatha could feel her face flush as her heartbeat pulsed down to her core. She was </span>
<em>
<span>not </span>
</em>
<span>going to make it if she didn’t find some way to distract herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She brought their hands back down to rest on the console as she directed her attention out the window. She took in deep calming breaths as she tried to think of something they could talk about, anything that could distract her from the aching desire that was growing deeper with every passing minute. As her mind struggled to settle on a topic Rio piped up,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So, I’ve been meaning to ask.” she started</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes?” Agatha replied, still half distracted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Have you thought of what you’re going to call him?” she asked </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Huh…?” Her gaze flitted back to Rio before falling down to the swell containing her son. “Oh, him! Yes…well no…not exactly.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio laughed at her flustered reply, “What does that mean?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, Ralph threw out a few disastrous suggestions but…I hadn’t given it much thought, yet.” she admitted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh really? What were his ideas?” Rio inquired curiously</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Richard, only so he could call him dick for short. Ralph junior, of course, another terrible suggestion. I think Clint was another one but none of these were serious. Why?” she asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Just curious. Wasn’t sure if there was something specific I should be calling him. Anything you’re leaning towards?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, nothing that’s stuck out. Do you have any suggestions?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not off the top of my head, but I’m not opposed to noodling on it.” Rio grinned as another question popped into her mind. “Do you know what </span>
<em>
<span>your </span>
</em>
<span>name would have been if you were a boy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha breathed a laugh, “What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If you had been born a boy, what would your name have been?” Rio repeated.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m not entirely sure. I probably would have been named after my grandfather.” Agatha figured.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And what was his name?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha scrunched her nose at the thought, “Ebenezer Aloysius Harkness the Third.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did you just sneeze?!” Rio cackled</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s a family name.” Agatha groaned, rolling her eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I gathered that.” Rio chuckled, “Wow, yeah, that would have been a rough childhood! You planning to carry on that tradition?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, not in the slightest! Like you said, I don’t want to give him a rough childhood. He already has enough going against him with me for a mother.” Agatha scoffed </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s lightheartedness quickly dissipated at the comment. “He’s lucky to have you for a mother, you know that right?” Her voice was calm and genuine as she glanced over worryingly at Agatha.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If you say so…” Agatha mumbled as she ran a hand over her bump.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha, you're going to be an amazing mother. Why would you think otherwise?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I wouldn’t exactly say I have the greatest blueprint for this.” she reasoned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That may be true, but you are nothing like your mother!” Rio said as she squeezed Agatha’s hand in reassurance. “If anything it shows you exactly what not to do!” Rio snorted before glancing back to catch Agatha’s doubtful expression. “Agatha, you love him, you wanted him so much you did whatever it took to create him. Sure he came as a bit of a shock to everyone but I see how much you already care for him and he’s not even here yet. The limited interaction I’ve had with your mother, I don’t even know if she’s even capable of that kind of love. Please, don’t compare yourself to her.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled meekly as a tear crept into the corner of her eye. She didn’t think she could love the woman before her more than in that moment. “So…” She huffed brushing the tear away as she redirected the subject. “What would your name have been? If you were born a boy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Honestly not much different than it is now.” Rio shrugged</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Seriously?” Agatha chuckled</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio Juan Luis Vidal, after my father.” Rio explained</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And what is your full name now?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio Florencia Vidal” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And where did that come from?” Agatha asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“My abuelita. I have vague memories of her from living in Puerto Rico, helping her in her kitchen making quesitos and mallorcas. The smell of cinnamon always reminds me of her.” she added with a wistfully nostalgic smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Have you ever gone back to see her?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, she… she passed away before we moved to the states, just after my brother was born. Lilia really is the only family I have left.” she admitted, flashing an aching smile in Agatha’s direction.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed at the harsh realization of how lonely and devastating Rio’s life had truly been. Nearly everyone she had cared for was gone by the time she was a teenager. No wonder she had been so determined not to lose this love that had quickly blossomed between them. “I’m…I’m so sorry.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I appreciate that, cariño, but you don’t need to be. Death is just…part of the natural order of the universe, we all have our time. It’s shown me how important it is to make meaning out of the time that we do have,” She raised their hands back to her lips, “and to cherish the ones who are closest to us.” She placed a kiss to the back of Agatha’s hand as they turned into her driveway. “Come on, love. Let’s go make the most of our evening.” She urged as she turned off the car and stepped out of the vehicle. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat silently in the car for a moment while Rio shuffled around gathering their things. She was trying not to dwell on the grief she had shared but it was now clearer why they had been so drawn to each other. They had each found a home in the other, a safe harbor in which to dock the sorrow and pain they had survived and see it transformed into the love and care they both deserved. </span>
</p><p>
<span>At last, bags in hand, Rio opened her door, halting her train of thought with a warm smile. “Ready? I think Scratchy might murder us if we don’t head in and feed him soon.” She chuckled as she nodded to the large front window where Agatha’s cat sat, swishing his fluffy tail as he stared daggers at them. Agatha smiled faintly before exiting the vehicle and leading them both inside. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as she opened the door they were greeted by incessant mewling as Scratchy rushed to press himself against her feet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know! I know you’re hungry, mister, but you have to let us in to feed you. I can’t do anything if you trip me.” she grumbled as she shuffled in the doorway. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio swooped in behind her, quickly dropping the items she was carrying and scooping up Scratchy in her arms. “Sorry man, I kept her out too late, but you have to be careful! Can’t have her falling!” Scratchy protested with a loud yelp as he jumped from her arms and rushed to his bowl. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If you wouldn’t mind feeding him I’ll go ahead and get dinner started.” Agatha asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re going to cook?” Rio looked at her with trepidation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, is that a problem?” Agatha questioned, eyebrow raised in challenge</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, not at all, I just…I didn’t think you cooked.” she explained</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I can cook!” Agatha protested</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m sure you can.” Rio chuckled</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m a good cook, great in fact!” She insisted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t doubt that for one second! I’m excited to see what you whip up.” Rio chuckled as she moved to grab Scratchy’s food bowl. “So, what’s on the menu?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’ll just have to wait and see when it’s ready!” Agatha huffed as she searched through her fridge. Rio watched cautiously as she filled Scratchy’s bowl, seeing Agatha collect an assortment of unlikely ingredients. “If you’re done feeding the cat I’ll ask you to go and have a seat. I don’t need you hovering while I’m trying to work.” she said as she shooed Rio away from the kitchen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes ma'am!” Rio snorted as she went and made herself comfortable on the couch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha fumbled around for nearly two hours, only setting off the fire alarms once, before calling Rio over for dinner. As she sat, Rio looked down at the plate trying to make sense of the pile of green, brown, tan, and purple that Agatha had served her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“This looks…delicious.” She commented as Agatha stood, waiting for her to take a bite. “What…um…does…does this dish have a name?” she asked as she speared a forkful of the mystery mush, bringing it to her nose to smell which was not helpful.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, not that I’m aware of. Go ahead, eat.” Agatha insisted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh…ok then.” Rio’s eyes grew wide in trepidation as she flashed a nervous smile before bringing the bite to her lips. She took a deep breath before sliding the food into her mouth. Somehow the food was both mushy and chewy with bits of burnt crunch here and there. There was a strong flavor of vinegar only matched by what must have been a whole head of garlic yet there wasn’t a grain of salt in sight. As she continued to chew she picked around on the plate, assembling another bite as she tried to determine what was actually in her mouth at the moment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So?” Agatha ask, still watching her closely</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mmmmm! MMMhhhmmmmm!” Rio replied, still trying to choke down the first bite as she nodded and gave a thumbs up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good right?” Agatha affirmed as she made herself a plate.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I…I don’t think I’ve ever had anything quite like this!” Rio admitted, “What…uh…what exactly is in this?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s something my grandfather used to make, though I couldn’t </span>
<em>
<span>quite </span>
</em>
<span>remember the recipe. It’s pork and purple cabbage with brussel sprouts and spaetzle.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Brussel sprouts and what?” Rio asked as she forced herself to take another bite. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Spaetzle. It’s like a German noodle dumpling.” Agatha explained as she went to take a bite. As soon as the food hit her tongue she made a disgusted face and forced herself to swallow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How is it?” Rio asked “Like your grandfather used to make?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It…um…it’s a bit different.” she reasoned as she tried to take another bite. Once she started chewing she felt her throat fighting to reject the food and she brought her fist up to her mouth in an attempt to keep it in. She felt herself gag as she went to swallow and rushed to grab a napkin. “Ugh, oh no. That…that is…awful!” she finally admitted as she rushed to grab a glass of water. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I mean, it’s…it’s not </span>
<em>
<span>that </span>
</em>
<span>bad.” Rio tried to reassure.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Please don’t try to spare my feelings, that is terrible!” Agatha insisted as she moved to throw away the rest of what was on her and Rio’s plates.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ok, yeah, not going to lie, that’s probably the worst thing I’ve ever eaten.” Rio finally admitted as she pushed away from the table.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t understand what I missed! I was pretty sure I had everything right, for the most part. I only made a couple substitutions. I didn’t think it would be that bad!” She said as she scraped the rest of the contents of the dinner she had made into the trash. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s alright, don’t worry about it! It happens to the best of us.” Rio reassured as she walked over to help Agatha.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes to glare at Rio. “None of your food ever tasted that bad.” she grumbled “Besides, what are we going to eat now? That took two hours and now I’m starving!” She could feel her chest tightening in disappointment as tears clung to the corners of her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey, it’s ok!” Rio breathed soothingly, seeing the storm brewing behind Agatha’s eyes. “I know a pizza place that’ll deliver in under 30 minutes. Why don’t you go take your shower and by the time you’re done it’ll be here.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah?” Agatha replied weepily </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“For sure! No big deal.” Rio shrugged with a smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No big deal?” Agatha repeated, sniffling as the few tears quickly turned into full on sobs.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“OH! Oh no!” Rio gasped as she gathered Agatha in a hug. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean…it’s ok, we don’t have to get pizza. I’ll go get whatever you want! I can go right now if you’d like.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No! No it’s not that it’s…” Agatha wept, head buried in Rio’s shoulder. “Why are you so nice to me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What do you mean?” Rio chuckled, feeling Agatha breathe shakily in her arms.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re just…you’re so thoughtful and understanding. You dropped everything to come to the appointment today and insisted I take time for myself. Not to mention you’re overlooking that disaster of a meal I just made you eat. This can’t possibly be worth it for you.” Agatha whined</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha, you’re everything to me!” She breathed as she pulled Agatha from her shoulder to stare into her reddened eyes, cradling her face in her hands. “I would go to the ends of the Earth if it would make you happy. I love you!”    </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha bit her lip as her gaze danced between Rio’s eyes before flitting down to her pillowy soft lips. The burning desire that had been sparked in the pool was now raging again within her. She surged forward, face drenched in tears, and pressed her lips to Rio’s. A soft moan escaped between them at the touch. Rio’s hands slid from Agatha’s face as her fingers snaked their way through into the roots of her messy bun. Agatha pulled at Rio’s waist, gathering her in as close as her stomach would allow. She pressed her tongue through Rio’s teeth, tasting her sweetness along with the remaining morsels of the dinner she had forced upon her. Rio responded in kind, sucking at Agatha’s bottom lip until it released with a gentle pop. Agatha leaned back in, searching for the connection but Rio pulled back, forcing their eyes to meet once again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I…I still need to order that pizza.” she huffed, trying to catch her breath.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyebrows stitched in disappointment as she rested her forehead against Rio’s, her chest heaving in breathlessness. “Do you?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I do. You need to eat something.” she breathed through a smirk as she pulled her face away. “Go shower, we’ll pick this up after dinner.” She pressed a quick kiss to Agatha’s lips before turning her away and giving her a push toward the hallway. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>😉~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~😜</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shuffled down the hallway, through her bedroom and into the bathroom, stripping her clothes off along the way. She turned on the shower and moved to gather a towel as she untangled her hair from the half damp bun on top of her head while it heated up. As she stepped in and submerged herself under the steaming water she felt her son stretch and shift in response, settling comfortably at her side as the water poured over the swell. She guided a hand to where he had settled, rubbing gentle circles along the surface. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey little bug.” She hummed “How are you doing in there? Did you have a good day? Did you enjoy the pool? Mama certainly did!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Glad to hear it!” Rio’s voice rang out unexpectedly. Agatha jumped as she moved to open the frosted glass door of the shower, finding Rio stripped bare before her. “Mind if I join you?” She asked, eyebrow hitched suggestively as a smirk pulled at the corner of her lips. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sh…sure” Agatha nodded as her heart skipped a beat. If her face hadn’t already been flushed from the heat of the water it would have glowed bright red at the ask. Agatha stood, eyes wide, arms clutched closely around her chest, as Rio stepped in and closed the door behind her. Rio confidently moved to stand before her, dipping her head under the flowing water, letting it cascade down her body. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t help but let her eyes wander along the taught curves. The way her slight perky breasts moved as her hands guided the water through her raven hair. She turned, pressing her face into the water, exposing the perfectly round, tender flesh of her ass. It looked so delicious Agatha could practically take a bite out of it. Rio turned again, reaching for the shampoo. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Turn around.” She instructed, nodding to Agatha. Agatha turned slowly, reluctantly giving up the view. After a moment she felt Rio’s nimble fingers massaging the soap into her scalp. She melted into the touch, letting out a deep sigh as her body released tension she didn’t even realize she was holding. Too soon she felt Rio’s fingers slip from her head to rest on her shoulders. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rinse” she murmured into her ear before pressing a kiss to her cheek. Rio guided her back under the water then turned to wash her own hair. As the water ran clean of suds Agatha moved to grab the conditioner but Rio’s hand snatched it out from under her as she wagged a soapy finger, </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Allow me, my love.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You don’t…” Agatha started </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Please.” Rio grinned as she traded spaces with Agatha to stand under the water. As Rio rinsed her own hair she combed conditioner through Agatha’s with her fingers. Once thoroughly coated, she braided the long tresses and tossed it over Agatha’s shoulder. As Agatha examined her handiwork she felt the crisp brush of the loofa graze across her shoulders followed by Rio’s warm hand helping to spread the soap along her arms. As Rio continued to work her way down, Agatha could feel her skin prickling under the touch, the desire within her reignighting once more like a breath on smouldering embers. Her hands caressed the soft, pillowy flesh of Agatha’s ass before sliding down the length of her legs, her fingers grazing dangerously close to her now throbbing core yet too distant to provide any relief. </span>
</p><p>
<span>In her hazy, lust-filled stupor Agatha turned, catching Rio kneeling on the tile floor before her. As their darkening eyes met Rio rose, her hands bracing the sides of Agatha’s swollen stomach, rubbing gentle, cleansing circles along the swell, feeling the strum of life beneath her fingertips. Rio tucked her bottom lip between her teeth as her hands continued upwards grasping at her swollen tender breasts, eliciting a sharp inhale from Agatha before continuing on to her collar bone. She leaned in close so their lips were nearly touching, and murmured, “Rinse.” before shifting aside to let Agatha step under the water. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Practically vibrating with desire, Agatha moved to wash off the suds, her eyes still locked on Rio as she cleansed her own body. She didn’t know how much longer she could wait, dinner be damned. This woman, this unbelievably astonishing, maddening woman was surely going to be the death of her. Her breath heaved as Rio shifted closer once more, edging into the water, and as the foamy bubbles dripped down her body into the drain she felt something break loose within her. Her hands grasped at Rio’s hips as she pushed her back against the tiled wall. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you have any idea what you’re doing to me?” She growled as her nails dug crescent shaped indents into the flesh below. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio grinned with salacious delight, “I have an inkling.” She tilted her chin upward in challenge as her tongue poked into the hollow of her cheek. “Too bad the food will be here any moment.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t give a shit about the fucking pizza! I need you, NOW!” She surged forward, sucking Rio’s bottom lip into her mouth before biting down on the plump muscle. Rio moaned as Agatha released her from between her teeth and began sucking her way down her jaw and neck. Her hands slid under the crest of her ass, fingertips toying with the sensitive flesh between her thighs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s head flung back to rest against the wall as her hands took purchase on Agatha’s shoulders. As she hitched up her left leg Agatha’s hand wound back around to dip between the soaked folds. She felt the touch of Agatha’s fingertips circling her soft, pulsating bud before two of her digits slipped easily inside of her. She let out a gasp as they curled, pressing at the spongy tissue within her. Her breath became labored as Agatha began pumping her wrist, drawing soft whimpering moans from Rio’s lips. She could feel her core begin to tighten, being pulled taught with every stroke, her walls fluttering around the nimble digits. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Fuck</span>
</em>
<span>…</span>
<em>
<span>Agatha</span>
</em>
<span>” she whimpered as she felt herself drawing nearer to release. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha lifted her head from where she had been suckling at the crook of Rio’s neck, locking her eyes onto Rio’s as she rested her forehead against her’s. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I can feel how close you are already. Let me hear it. </span>
<em>
<span>Let me hear you come apart for me.</span>
</em>
<span>” Agatha breathed into the shell of her ear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio cried out as Agatha pressed another finger inside of her, stretching her deliciously. Her other hand moved to pinch and pull a pebbled nipple between her fingers, accelerating her climb towards ecstasy. Her whimpering grew frantic as her hips thrust in rhythm with Agatha’s fingers.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Yes…yes…fuck! Right there…don’t stop!</span>
</em>
<span>” She screamed as Agatha thrust deeper into her. She could feel her legs beginning to quake as the pressure inside her grew, sharpening in intensity. Then, like a white hot flash of lightning, her orgasm crashed through her and she groaned in delight. She threw her arm out, bracing against the wall for balance as her body shook in pleasure. Agatha’s fingers slowed, coaxing her through the waves crashing over and over within her. Then, as her body stilled, slumping against the wall, Agatha withdrew, popping her fingers into her mouth, one at a time, savoring Rio’s sweet release. With a satisfied grin Agatha turned off the water and moved to step out of the shower. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Where…where are you going?” Rio huffed, still trying to gather herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m pretty sure I heard the doorbell ring.” she explained as she wrapped herself in her robe. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I thought you didn’t care about the pizza.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t.” She winked as she threw her hair up into a towel and turned to leave the bathroom. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stood, frozen on the spot as she tried to compose herself. Once she felt steady enough she moved as quickly as her shaky legs would allow to gather a towel and drip her way along in Agatha’s wake to the living room. There she found Agatha robe hanging loosely around her, perched on a stool half-way through a slice of pizza. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“YOU!” Rio growled</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Moi?” Agatha gasped in mocked surprise</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You have no idea what you’ve started!” Rio warned as she walked over to grab her bag. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, </span>
<em>
<span>I </span>
</em>
<span>started it, did I?” Agatha teased.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If you weren’t eating right now I’d have you spread open on that counter screaming my name.” Rio scoffed as she snatched up a slice of pizza and quickly devoured it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is that all that’s stopping you?” She chuckled as Rio grabbed another slice and headed back down the hallway towards the bedroom. “I wouldn’t bother getting dressed if I were you!” she called after her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh don’t worry I’m not! You have ten minutes, eat up!” Rio shouted before closing the bedroom door behind her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>After consuming about half the pizza Agatha worked up the nerve to wander down the hallway and see what Rio had been up to in the bedroom. As she pushed the door open she found the room illuminated in candlelight, fires flickering on nearly every surface. The air was awash with the scent of amber and oud, warm and inviting. She threw the towel off of her hair as she searched around for Rio. As she peeked into the empty, dark bathroom she heard her sultry voice call out from behind her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Took you long enough.” Rio chuckled as she stepped out from the closet. Agatha turned, catching the woman bathed in the glowing light of the flickering flames, illuminating every divot and curve of her slender figure. Her eyes locked in on the leather strap hanging securely at her hips, an electric green dildo protruding suggestively from the center. Rio walked forward, swinging her hips at every step. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Missing something?” She asked, holding up the belt to Agatha’s robe that was draped open around her figure. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Where did you find that? I’ve been looking everywhere for it!” Agatha exclaimed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Somehow it made its way into my things. I stumbled upon it the other day, figured you might want it back.” Rio shrugged as she held the strip aloft. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Indeed!” Agatha replied as she reached out to grab the fabric, but Rio pulled it away just out of reach. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, no, not yet, I have a few other ideas in mind first.” She nodded her head, gesturing for Agatha to settle on the bed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha took a step past Rio and felt a finger tug at the back of her robe, sliding the garment from her body. As she turned her head to glance back she felt a sharp smack ring across the crest of her ass cheek. She jumped at the sensation, letting out a surprised gasp as arousal pooled in her core. She eased herself onto the edge of the bed crossing her legs, her arms bracing her weight as she leaned back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio moved to kneel once again before Agatha, her hands gliding up the length of her legs sending sparks of electricity throughout her body. She leaned forward pressing a kiss to the top of her knee as her hands continued to wander along Agatha’s thighs and around to the curve of her ass. She sat up slightly placing a tender kiss along the swell of her stomach as her eyes locked onto Agatha’s </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Lie back” she instructed as she continued to rise, pulling the ribbon of fabric taught between her hands before sliding it between her teeth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha could feel a flush returning to her cheeks as she slid herself further onto the bed and leaned back, her damp wavy hair falling loosely around her. Rio moved to straddle her hips, the green protuberance hovering ominously between them. She leaned forward gathering both of Agatha’s arms, holding them together in one hand before her. With the other she snatched the fabric from her mouth and began wrapping it snuggly around her wrists. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Comfortable my love?” She asked as she knotted the ribbon. Agatha nodded as her chest heaved with bated breath. “Don’t be shy, use your words.” Rio smirked as her eyes gleamed with desire. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes…quite comfortable.” She breathed as her body tingled in anticipation. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good. Let me know if that changes.” Rio hummed. Then she leaned forward pushing Agatha’s hands above her head into the mattress as her knee shifted to press at her throbbing core. Agatha keened at the sudden pressure, her chest rising as she arched off the bed, brushing against Rio as she leaned in further, taking Agatha’s lips into her’s, swallowing her moan. Their tongues and teeth clashed in a voracious duel to consume the other. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As her hands braced Agatha’s arms, holding her in place, Rio began to work her way down her body, sucking and nipping love bites into the supple ivory flesh of her neck and chest. As Rio continued her journey her hands followed, cupping the ample swell of Agatha’s breasts as her mouth latched onto the erect nipple, her fingers grasping at the pillowy flesh. Agatha sucked in sharply, pulling her bottom lip between her teeth as pleasure began to radiate throughout her whole body. Her eyes fluttered closed, surrendering to the moment. Rio licked a trail along her chest as she moved her attention to the other breast, pulling at the sensitive bud with her teeth before soothing the skin with her tongue. This caused Agatha to lurch upward, her pool blue eyes blown wide with desire as she stared down at Rio who was now making her way further down her body. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hands rested on either side of the swell as she trailed delicate kisses down along the bump, her warm breath sending sparks down to Agatha’s core. Then, just as her face was about to disappear behind the mound she sat up abruptly, her hair flying in a dramatic arc around her. She slid off the end of the bed then leaned over, scooping her arms under each of Agatha’s thighs, anchoring her hands at the crest of each hip. In one strong motion she pulled Agatha to the edge then knelt down, guiding each foot to rest on the footboard as her hands drew her legs to spread wide. Rio froze, her breath catching as she stared at the sight before her, Agatha’s dark folds already drenched, practically dripping on the surface below her. She could feel drool pooling in her mouth as she marveled at the wonder between her legs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After she sat there for a moment, feeling nothing, Agatha sat up as best she could with her hands still tied.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Everything alright?” she asked, a twinge of self consciousness pricking at the back of her mind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio popped her head up from between Agatha’s thighs. “More than alright, my love. You’re positively perfect!” She pressed another kiss to the swell before gliding to the right to repeat the nipping and biting down Agatha’s thigh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha could feel the pressure building as Rio drew closer to her core. The careful touches drew out whimpering moans as she threw her head back onto the bed. She bit her lip as she felt Rio’s hot breath dance across her folds, taunting, teasing the pleasure that her body was truly seeking. Then, just as she thought she couldn’t take the waiting any longer, she felt Rio’s tongue press along the length of her slit. She keened in delight as her eyes rolled back into her head. Rio’s lips latched on to the sensitive bud as she suckled, drawing desperate pleas from Agatha’s lips. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>OHGODSYES!” </span>
</em>
<span>she screamed as her hands came down, reaching over the bump, to anchor themselves in Rio’s hair. “</span>
<em>
<span>Fuck…you feel so good!</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Spurred on by the noises, Rio slid her tongue down, gliding it in between the folds before dipping into Agatha’s entrance, earning another gasping scream from her. She pressed further in, her nose grazing her clit as she lapped up the dripping mess that was pouring out of her. As she felt Agatha’s legs begin to tremble she tightened her grip on her thighs spreading them wider. She felt a sting at the root of her crown as Agatha’s grasp tightened in her hair pulling her upward to her clit. Rio responded generously, taking the bud between her lips and circling her tongue as she sucked fervently. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha arched off the bed at the stimulation, her breath coming in frantic pants as her building climax rose higher and higher. Her mind went blank, save for the crescendoing waves of pleasure that were drawing her closer and closer to the edge. She soared past the precipice into the stratosphere as Rio relentlessly suckled on the nub, drawing her to heights she didn’t think possible. Just as she thought the pressure would consume her, with her walls fluttering and her legs quaking, Rio reached a hand up to palm at her breast, and then</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>SNAP</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span> The floodgates opened. Wave after wave of white hot seering pleasure crashed over her. She screamed in ecstasy, her body shaking violently, arching off the bed as her legs sandwiched Rio’s head between them, her breath coming in ragged bursts. Minutes passed before she returned to her body, limp and pulsing in the aftermath of her orgasm. She had never felt that kind of raw pleasure ever before and now that she had a taste she was ravenous for more. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s head lifted from between her thighs, grinning in self-satisfaction. Her tongue poked out, lapping up the glistening remnants Agatha had left on her chin and cheeks before wiping herself clean with the back of her hand. She leaned forward, bracing herself on either side of Agatha’s flushed and glowing form. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Satisfied, my love?” she panted, trying to catch her breath.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded breathlessly as her bound hands reached up, clasping Rio’s jaw, pulling her down to meet her in a kiss. The taste of herself on Rio’s plump, sticky lips, the press of the strap against her core, it immediately reignited the spark within her. She shifted quicker than either of them expected, toppling Rio onto her back as she straddled her hips, the green member pressing between them as her hands latched around Rio’s neck.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Untie me!” she commanded as Rio nodded under the pressure, grinning from ear to ear. Her hands drifted up to release Agatha from her bonds. As she went to throw the ribbon to the side Agatha grabbed her by the wrist.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, don’t think for one second you’re getting off that easily.” she scoffed, grabbing the fabric from Rio’s hand. She looped the string in half and tucked it behind Rio’s head, pulling the tail through the loop she had created at the other end and fastening it closely around her neck. “Too tight?” she asked, raising her eyebrows.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span> Rio smirked, flashing her eyes as she grabbed Agatha’s wrist and yanked it away from her, pulling the hold tighter. Agatha breathed a laugh of astonishment before leaning down, taking Rio in a passionate kiss. As she pulled away from Rio with a pop she slipped her fingers between her folds, gathering the fluids Rio had summoned then slowly coated the strap, tip to base. She raised herself onto her knees, one hand holding tightly to the ribbon around Rio’s neck, the other aligned the tip of the strap with her entrance. As she sank down, taking the length within her, Rio’s hands wandered to rest on her hips. She gasped, throwing her head back as she bottomed out, her free hand pressing into Rio’s chest as she sat adjusting to the stretch. After a moment she brought her head up to gaze lustfully at Rio. She grinned weakly as she adjusted slightly, raising up a few inches before sitting back down. As she moved to lift again Rio held her in place. She gazed down in confusion as Rio chuckled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wait a second…” she urged as she reached her hand between them. Agatha watched Rio fumble with the toy beneath her for a moment before she felt vibrations echo within her. Her eyes jumped to catch Rio’s in shock.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It vibrates?” she gasped, a look of dumbfounded pleasure growing across her face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, “I can make it go faster if you’d like.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“NO! No, this…this is…</span>
<em>
<span>perfect.</span>
</em>
<span>” she whined as she began to thrust against Rio. The vibrations were stimulating the delicious sweet spot within her, quickly rebuilding the taught anticipation. She leaned forward, her head dipping down as she moaned in delight. She began to raise herself up, pulling the toy from within her, feeling the tremors rub across her spongy nerves before sinking back down. She repeated this motion, gathering a rhythm that was quickly drawing moans from both her and Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s thumbs pressed into the edges of Agatha’s thighs as she guided her up and down on the strap. Each landing blow intensifying the vibrating against her clit. Seeing the glowing green member repeatedly disappearing inside of her was sending shockwaves of pleasure throughout her body, driving her mad with pleasure. All of this along with the pressure at her neck was drawing her quickly to the edge. As Agatha’s thrusts intensified she could feel her wetness dripping down the strap coating her lap. With this added sensation she wouldn’t be able to last much longer and she could feel and hear Agatha growing closer along with her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As their panting became more erratic Agatha could feel the pressure intensifying once again. The coil within her tightened to the point where she felt like her whole body might shatter before she came. Her hips began to stutter to where she could barely raise herself from Rio so she let herself sink and began to grind once again into her pelvis. She looked up through sweat dripping locks taking in Rio’s flushed, lust filled gaze. She wrapped the tail of the fabric she was still holding around her palm and gave it a sharp tug. Rio’s eyes flew to the back of her head as her mouth dropped open, keening at the pressure as her body seized beneath her, her orgasm washing over her. The sight of this stunning woman falling to pieces below her broke something within her and her body exploded in pleasure. As her body shook in another earth shattering orgasm she felt a gush of liquid release from her entrance. She looked down gasping in shock as she quickly rolled herself off of Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It broke!” she screeched in panic clutching at her crotch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?” Rio panted, turning to Agatha with a dazed look of confusion as she pulled the ribbon from around her neck. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“My water, it broke!” she cried, her crystal blue eyes sharp with fear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, no way it’s too early.” she heaved as she rested a hand along the swell. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I felt it, did you not feel it? Where’s my phone, I need to call Jen.” she began to jostle, looking around for her phone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Stop, take a breath.” She urged as her hand cupped Agatha’s face, drawing her gaze in. “I mean, I definitely felt </span>
<em>
<span>something</span>
</em>
<span>, but I don’t think it was your water.” she chuckled then quickly stilled, seeing the concern still etched on Agatha’s face. “But if it will make you feel better I’ll find your phone and we can call Jen.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded furiously before collapsing back onto the bed with a troubled sigh. Rio rolled herself off the bed and relieved herself of the strap before glancing around the room for Agatha’s phone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you remember where you had it last?” she asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I think it was in the kitchen.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ok, stay there, I’ll be right back.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sat as still as possible, her chest shuddering as her lip quivered in fear. </span>
<em>
<span>This couldn’t be happening. He couldn’t come this early, he wouldn’t survive! How could she have been so stupid? Risking everything for one night of passion.</span>
</em>
<span> Just as tears were collecting in the corners of her eyes Rio returned with her phone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Here you are. Do you want to talk to Jen or do you want me to chat with her?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll put it on speaker.” she croaked as the tears began to fall. She quickly pulled up Jen’s contact page and pressed the call button. The phone rang a few times before Jen’s voice rang out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey Agatha, what’s up?” she asked, unamused and seemingly unsurprised by the call. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jen…it broke!” Agatha cried “My water broke.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wait, are you sure?” Jen asked in confusion</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No! That’s why I’m calling you. What should I do?” Agatha’s voice was shaky with panic</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How far along are you?” Jen asked calmly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Almost 30 weeks.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ok, are you having any contractions?” she continued</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, no I don’t think so.” Agatha replied as her eyes darted nervously to Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Trust me you would know. When did this happen?” Jen asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Just now.” Agatha panted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you alone?” Jen asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, Rio is here.” Agatha admitted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>There was silence on the line before Jen let out an exasperated sigh. “Oh really? Put her on.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey Jen!” Rio called out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey, I know I’m going to regret asking but what happened exactly?” Jen asked her</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well…we…we were…enjoying each other’s company…” Rio started</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span> “Oh god.” Jen groaned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And Agatha felt a…how would you describe it, love?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It like gushed out of me.” Agatha shouted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ok, </span>
<em>
<span>definitely </span>
</em>
<span>regret asking and I hate that I have to ask more questions. At what point in your lovemaking did this happen?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio cleared her throat before responding. “It…uh…it was right at the end.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright…well, given you’re not having contractions and considering the context…pretty sure that wasn’t your water.” Jen scoffed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Really? How can we be sure?” Agatha breathed, still not totally convinced. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What are you doing right now?” Jen asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She’s laying still on the bed.” Rio answered</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ok, I want you to get up.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio held out her hand to help Agatha up off the bed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright, I’m up.” Agatha shouted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Any fluids?” Jen asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Though she felt nothing she looked down to double check.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, nothing.” she admitted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah…not your water. Now that </span>
<em>
<span>that </span>
</em>
<span>mystery has been solved I’m going to go before you scar me even further.” Jen abruptly hung up the phone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha dropped the phone on the bed then stared dumbfoundedly at Rio. “What happened then?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You seriously don’t know?” Rio snickered</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you understand what happened?” she asked, still nervous and confused.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah” Rio chuckled “Agatha, you squirted.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh…</span>
<em>
<span>oh</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah. See? Nothing to worry about.” Rio reassured as she gathered Agatha in a hug.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I can’t believe I just called Jen to ask about that.” she groaned into Rio’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s fine! Better to make sure, right? Come on, go rise off again, I’ll clean up the mess and we can settle in for the night.” she said, releasing Agatha from her embrace. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha brought her hands up to press against her face. “I’m such an idiot.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s ok, you didn’t know!” Rio encouraged as she pressed a kiss to her forehead. “Go on.” She urged as she pushed her towards the bathroom.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>A few minutes later, Rio had changed over the sheets and Agatha had returned from the shower once again to snuggle closely together under the covers. Rio leaned against the headboard as Agatha rested against her chest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Feeling better, my love?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hmmmm…much. I’m so relaxed, my body feels heavy.” she sighed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How’s the little man doing?” She asked, brushing a hand over the bump.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fine, he seems perfectly relaxed as well.” Agatha replied</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good.” she breathed as she bent down to press a kiss to Agatha’s forehead. She shimmied down further to rest on the pillows, pulling Agatha in tight to her chest as she let her eyes flutter closed. Moments passed as they sat together, breathing in harmony, before Agatha spoke.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What was she like?” Agatha breathed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Who?” Rio hummed sleepily</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Your mother?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A wistful smile tugged at the corners of Rio’s sleepy lips. “Mmmm…she…she was kind, and strong. Probably the one of the strongest women I’ve ever known. But, she knew how to find the joy in nearly everything.” Rio chuckled softly to herself, “She would always drag my brother and I to mass on Sundays, even though she knew we hated it, so to make it up to us we would always stop for ice cream or some sort of treat afterwards. It…it was a struggle…to make that happen for us but she managed it…every week, one way or another.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She sounds like a wonderful mother.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She was magnificent. She never let us see her sweat, always made time for us when she could. She was…what I believe…a mother should be.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha felt a twinge of pain pull at her chest. Sadness for Rio and her loss, jealousy and grief that she had never experienced a love like that from her own mother, and somewhere at the heart of it all a yearning for her child to experience the same kind of devotion. She breathed in deeply as she felt her son shift languidly beneath their fingers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And your brother, what was he like?” she asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio immediately let out a chuckle, “Stubborn! No, but really, he was endlessly curious and amazingly creative. He was always crafting something. Whether it was a pillow fort or an entirely made up town, complete with fire station, mayor, and police chief. His mind was always coming up with something. We did everything together. He…he was my best friend.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What was his name?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nicolas. Nicolas Juan Luis Vidal. Nico for short.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mmmm, Nicholas.” Agatha breathed as she snuggled deeper into Rio’s chest. “Rio?” she called, tilting her head to gather her attention.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, my love?” Rio blinked her eyes open once again as she gazed down at Agatha.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stared deeply into Rio’s heavy amber eyes, “I love you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I love you too, cariño.” She leaned down pressing a delicate kiss to her lips. Then as she rested her head atop Agatha’s they drifted together quickly into slumber. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>—--------------------------------------------</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span> The next morning, as light filtered through the curtains, Agatha sturred. As she lay there still half asleep she could feel something warm and heavy wrapped around her side. A pleasant ache hummed throughout her body and as she breathed in she was greeted with the scent of cool rain and moss mixed with a warm oud and a hint of musk. Her head was resting against a warm rising and falling surface and as she blinked herself awake she found herself snuggled into the crook of Rio’s arms. She lifted her head from resting on Rio’s chest and she rolled slowly to grab her phone from the nightstand to check the time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>7:27</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her alarm was minutes away from ringing. She turned it off, laid her phone down then shifted to snuggle further into Rio’s sleeping form. She was welcomed with a reflexive squeeze and a soft groggy moan that escaped Rio’s lips as she too began to stur.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good morning, my love.” Agatha hummed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A sleepy smile grew across Rio’s face as she stretched into consciousness. “Good morning, cariño. Did you sleep well?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Very! This is the first night in a while that I slept completely through without </span>
<em>
<span>someone </span>
</em>
<span>waking me up.” She moved to drape her leg further over Rio but felt an urgency tug at her bladder. “Ugh!” she groaned as she shifted to sit at the edge of the bed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Where are you going?” Rio chuckled dazedly as her arms lingered on Agatha’s touch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Bathroom, before I pee the bed.” She pushed herself to stand and wobbled, finding her legs heavy and sore. She stumbled to the bathroom hurriedly to relieve herself and returned quickly to join Rio back under the covers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So, what’s the plan?” Rio asked through a yawn.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I need to be in the office by 9 so we should probably leave by 8:30.” Agatha explained</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How long will it take you to get ready?” Rio asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“These days? Like 45 minutes if I’m quick about it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What time is it now?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“7:30. I know I should get up but I want to stay here, just a few more minutes.” Agatha grumbled as she snuggled deeper into Rio’s side.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio squeezed her in close. “Stay here as long as you like, cariño.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I enjoyed yesterday…and last night.” she hummed as she stared up into Rio’s tired, heavy amber eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Me too. Best day I’ve had in a long time, by far!” She pressed a kiss to the top of Agatha’s head. “What do you two want for breakfast?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh, I don’t know that I have much here. I was supposed to run to the store yesterday but…well, we kind of got…distracted.” She smiled up at Rio bashfully.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not to worry! I’ll run out and grab us something. Anything in particular tickle your fancy?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“A smoothie would be great with like a blueberry muffin, but I’m also kind of craving a southwest bagel sandwich, with like avocado and those pickled peppers. OOO and crispy potatoes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled at the enthusiasm. “Ok then, sounds like I better get moving!” She pulled herself from underneath Agatha and slipped out of bed, quickly throwing on some clothes she had packed in her bag. As she zipped up her pants she turned to find Agatha still lazing in bed, the blankets tucked loosely around her, her long hair spread out around her in flowing tangled waves as her icy blue eyes stared up at Rio in wonder. She was a vision, like a statue of a roman goddess carved out of marble, round and smooth and perfect. Rio padded over to the side of the bed and leaned in to press a kiss to the swell of her stomach before moving higher to Agatha’s lips. Before she could make contact Agatha’s hand came up between them to block the connection. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Please, I haven’t even brushed my teeth yet.” Agatha insisted</span>
<span>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked as she grabbed Agatha’s hand, lowering it, “And you think I care? Shut up and kiss me!” She leaned over, pressing a quick kiss to Agatha’s lips before heading for the door. “Go ahead and get ready, I’ll be back in time to take you to work.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>  </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>At exactly 8:30 on the dot Rio returned to collect Agatha, feast safely tucked away in the warm car waiting for her. They journeyed together in a quiet comfortability, the only sounds were the shuffling of takeout bags and the lilt of indie music that Rio had set for the ride. It was peaceful, blissful, the kind of morning Agatha had only dreamed of before. As they pulled up outside of her building Agatha sighed, not wanting to part from the woman who had brought her so much ease and safety, and wander into the mayhem that was in store once she walked through those doors. She leaned over and grabbed her bag then moved to exit the vehicle but was stopped by Rio’s hand grabbing her arm suddenly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey! Don’t I get a kiss goodbye?” She begged, eyes large and pleading as her lower lip bent forward in a pout. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled as she sat back down, dropping her bag on the floor, and leaned over the console. Her hands came up to cradle Rio’s face as she pulled her into a kiss. Rio hummed in delight as her hand came up, grabbing Agatha’s wrist holding her in place. Too quickly Agatha parted, pushing herself back out the door and closing it behind her. She turned to lean into the window Rio had rolled down. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What are your plans today?” she asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I have some cleaning to do and I was going to go to the library at some point. Other than that not much” Rio explained</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Will I see you later?” she asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I would love that! Text me when you’re home and we can figure something out.” Rio replied.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Will do! Love you!” Agatha called out as she headed up the steps of her building.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Love you too, both of you!” Rio shouted after her, rolling up the window and waving as she drove off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha turned and reluctantly headed inside to face the task of finding not only a marketing agency but the funding to afford one for their dauntingly demanding event, though now it all seemed more manageable. Knowing Rio was there by her side made everything less intimidating, less overwhelming. As she sauntered down the hallway towards her office she greeted Sharon warmly who responded pleasantly shocked and surprised. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh! Yes! Well, good morning to you too dear! Are you feeling any better?” Sharon asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Much, thank you Sharon. What time is my meeting with finance?” Agatha questioned as she sorted through the various pieces of mail waiting for her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not until 10:30 and you’ll have the full hour.” Sharon explained</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wonderful! That should give me enough time to get everything in order. I’ll be in my office, shout if you need anything.” Agatha replied as she tossed most of the mail in the garbage beside Sharon’s desk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Of course dear!” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She stepped into her office and as she went to throw her bag on her desk she stopped. Atop her desk sat a soft yellow gift bag. It was patterned with various baby animals, clearly intended to be a gift for her child. She set her work bag down in her chair and moved to open the gift. Underneath the tissue paper laid a stuffed animal. As she pulled it out of the bag it revealed itself to be a tan toy rabbit with long droopy ears. She turned the item over in her hands, confusedly examining it before searching the bag further for any kind of note or card revealing who it was from but found nothing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She wandered back out to Sharon’s desk holding the toy and asked, “Is this from you?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, no dear. Is that what was in that gift bag?” Sharon asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes. If it’s not from you then where did it come from?” Agatha questioned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“A courier dropped it off this morning so I placed it on your desk.” Sharon explained</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Was there any note or message with it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, dear, just the bag.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Huh” she huffed as she turned to head back into her office. Just as she crossed the threshold she heard her phone ringing in her bag. She dropped the toy back on her desk and grabbed her phone. It was her lawyer, Valentina. She took a breath then answered the call.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good morning, Val. Do you have an update for me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes! Good morning. We’ve finally been assigned a court date. I was able to get us on the docket the first Wednesday in April. That’s in a couple of weeks, will that work for you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, I’ll make it work. What time?”</span>
<span>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>“8:30. I’m not sure how long it will take but I’d plan to take off the whole day just in case.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed in annoyance. “If it will put an end to this whole thing I’ll do what I need to. Did you have any more insight on the will?’</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I finally got a hold of a copy of their document yesterday. It took your mother’s lawyer way longer than it should have to send it over. I haven’t had a chance to dig into it yet but on first look the document seems authentic.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart dropped at that discovery. “What would that mean?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nothing for the time being. There are a few red flags I’m having my assistant dig into. We’ll plan to meet up soon to go over everything. I’m happy to schedule something for after your work hours.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thank you, I appreciate that.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Of course. Until then try not to dwell on things. I’ll reach out soon about scheduling a time. For now, enjoy your weekend, I’ll see you sometime next week.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“See you.” She hung up the phone and flung it onto her desk. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>In her bliss with Rio she had pushed off the idea of dealing with her mother but now, with the date set it was inevitable. She would have to face her once again and the thought sent a cold chill of dread down her spine. She closed her eyes, rubbing her temples to relieve the stress that had built during the conversation. As she did so she felt her son shift dramatically within her, as if finally waking up for the day at the anxiety that was now thrumming through her. </span>
</p><p><br/><span>“Morning little bug.” She hummed as she brought a hand down to the swell. “Don’t worry, you’ll never have to deal with that woman if I can help it.” She let out a sigh as her hand continued to rub soothing circles along the surface, and then her eye caught sight of the toy and a fear pricked up her spine. </span><em><span>No, surely she wouldn’t!</span></em> <em><span>How could she possibly know? </span></em><span>Her heart skipped a beat as she picked up the toy and the bag once again. No name, no note anywhere in sight. Then, quickly, as if the items had caught fire in her hands, she threw them in the trash. Whatever game Evanora thought she was playing Agatha was not going to be a part of it. </span></p>

<span>“So, she’s stalking you?” Jen grumbled as she sipped wine on Agatha’s couch while she and Rio prepared dinner in the kitchen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, I don’t think it’s </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span> specifically. More likely someone from her congregation. There’s this women’s group that she leads and the seven of them hang on her every word. I swear they’d kill for her if she asked them to.” Agatha explained</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s a fucking cult.” Rio noted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I guess you could call it that.” Agatha shrugged as she chopped vegetables.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I mean, why else would these people be keeping tabs on you?” Rio reasoned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Morbid curiosity, entertainment, sheer nosiness? I don’t know, I don’t really care, I just want it to stop! I want her out of my life once and for all but I don’t know what to do. The restraining order clearly didn’t work!” Agatha groaned, exasperatedly throwing the chopped vegetables onto a baking tray.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What all has she sent you?” Alice asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It started with this stupid toy rabbit that showed up at my office last Friday. I immediately threw it in the trash. Then she followed up with a childrens bible on Monday, I told the courier to return to sender but the fucking thing showed up at my house later that day. That also went straight in the trash. Then this morning as I’m trying to leave for work I almost trip over that fucking box.” she gestured to a gift box tossed by the side of the door. “I didn’t have time to deal with it so I just threw it there. I swear if another garbage item shows up at my house tomorrow I’m going to fucking lose it!” Agatha groaned frustratedly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Soooo fucking weird!” Jen chuckled as she moved to grab the box, eyeing it curiously. “Are you going to open it?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why would I?” Agatha snorted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Aren’t you curious?” Jen asked, turning the box over in her hands.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not in the slightest! I really should just throw it out.” Agatha reasoned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If that’s the case you won’t mind if I open it.” Jen inquired</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Knock yourself out! It’s going in the trash either way.” Agatha waived dismissively as she handed the tray to Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen peeled back the silver wrapping paper revealing a department store clothing box. As she lifted the lid she discovered a tiny, lacy white gown. “What the fuck is this?” she asked as she held the garment up between her fingers. “Why did she send you a baby dress?” Jen’s voice dripped with disgust.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh…it’s a christening gown.” Agatha scoffed as she looked over at what Jen was holding.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The fuck?” Jen grumbled, scrunching her face in confusion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s a church thing.” Agatha clarified</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Have you reached out to the post office about blocking what she tries to send you?” Alice asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well Sharon knows not to accept any other packages at the office. But I don’t know that the ones that are showing up here are even going through the mail.” Agatha shrugged</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Woah, wait, you think she’s dropping them here herself?” Jen asked in astonishment.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, again I’m pretty sure it’s just one of her minions. Like I said, that box showed up before I even left for work.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t quite understand her thought process here.” Alice said, brows etched in contemplation. “She’s suing you </span>
<em>
<span>and </span>
</em>
<span>sending you gifts.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, technically they’re not </span>
<em>
<span>for</span>
</em>
<span> me.” Agatha explained</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio slammed the oven door shut causing everyone to jump. “I fucking hate this! It’s psychotic and manipulative!” Rio shouted, slamming a tray back on the stove. “All this weird passive aggressive evangelical bullshit! There’s no way she’s ever going anywhere near this child, not if I can help it!” Rio growled</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“When do you have to see her?” Alice asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“A week from tomorrow. I am not looking forward to it.” Agatha groaned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No shit!” Jen chuckled</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We’re supposed to meet with my lawyer tomorrow to prep. I’ll be interested to hear what she has to say.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re telling her about the gifts right?” Jen insisted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, absolutely! I don’t know that it will make a difference but I’m hoping it might help prove stalking and maybe we can refile the restraining order. I picked up some security cameras so if anything else does show up we’ll at least have some sort of documentation of what’s been happening.” Rio explained. “I know I’ve said this before but I really wish we had filed charges when she attacked Agatha in Boston. I feel like that would have been the nail in her coffin, she wouldn’t have been able to appeal the original restraining order, and we wouldn’t be dealing with this now. This is the last thing she needs!” Rio grumbled, gesturing to Agatha as she put another tray in the oven. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll be fine! I’ve been dealing with her pulling stunts like this my entire life. They’re definitely getting old but at this point there isn’t much else I can do other than face it. I just feel bad that you’ve been dragged into this.” She sighed as she leaned her head onto Rio’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, no, no. I’m more than happy to be the person to tell her to go fuck herself on your behalf.” Rio replied, wrapping her arm around Agatha’s shoulders.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oof, I am right there with you! I’ve been there for some of the other crap she’s pulled and it’s way past time for her to learn her lesson! As a principle, I don’t condone elder abuse but </span>
<em>
<span>that </span>
</em>
<span>woman needs to get her fucking shit rocked.” Jen scoffed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh don’t worry, I’m more than prepared to handle her!” Rio insisted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Rio…</span>
</em>
<span>” Agatha warned, rising to glare scoldingly at Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, I know dear! I won’t do anything that’ll get me fired, or thrown in jail.” Rio confirmed before walking over and pouring Alice a glass of wine. “Unless she starts throwing hands again then all bets are off.” She mumbled to Alice and Jen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She’s not going to get violent in a courtroom.” Agatha called from the kitchen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t know, she didn’t seem to have a problem slapping you in front of like 12 strangers.” Rio barked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m convinced that was a fluke. We were in our house, on familiar territory and she wasn’t expecting me to stand up to her so when I called her a bitch I think her reflexes just kicked in.” Agatha reasoned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I mean you weren’t wrong. She’s a grade A bitch if I’ve ever seen one.” Jen snorted </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright, dinner’s almost ready, can we please stop talking about my mother? I don’t want to think about her any more than I already have to.” Agatha groaned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Of course, cariño.” Rio cooed as she placed a kiss on Agatha’s cheek. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How’s the new living situation been working out?” Agatha asked Jen and Alice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ve been pretty happy with it.” Alice smiled coyly, “How about you?” she asked, gazing lovingly at Jen who was already beaming.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh my gosh! I can’t begin to tell you the difference it’s made! There’s so much space, I have access to a full kitchen with a dishwasher, it’s like ten minutes closer to the hospital, and on top of that I get to see Alice everyday now! Honestly, better than I could have imagined! What about you two?” She asked as she took a sip of wine.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What about us?” Agatha snorted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Come on, have you two spent a day apart since you got back together?” Jen chuckled</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fair enough.” Rio shrugged. “I mean, why would we want to spend another day apart?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Gross!” Jen groaned “How have you been feeling? Everything go alright at your last check in with Vicky?” she asked, shifting the conversation as quickly as she could.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fine, all things considered. She said he seems healthy and happy, growing appropriately so that makes me feel better.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>But…</span>
</em>
<span>” Rio pressed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But, she did say my blood pressure was </span>
<em>
<span>slightly </span>
</em>
<span>high so we’ve been monitoring that more frequently.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, and how’s that been going?” Jen inquired</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Still higher than it should be, which makes sense given everything she’s dealing with, so definitely a concern. I think the next visit is after the court date next week. She said if it hasn’t gone down by then she’ll prescribe something.” Rio explained. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span> “Yeah, that’s definitely something you want to stay on top of. We don’t need any complications.” Jen insisted, raising her eyebrows in concern. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She said it’s probably stress related so that doesn’t help. There are quite a few factors contributing to that at the moment.” Agatha added, eyes widened in emphasis. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Which is why I’ve been telling you to take it easy. In fact, go sit down while I finish up.” Agatha rolled her eyes as she padded over to collapse in the armchair across from Jen and Alice on the couch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, that reminds me! I brought you something!” Jen jumped up to grab her bag. “After you called me last week I figured this might give you some peace of mind </span>
<em>
<span>without </span>
</em>
<span>having to call and divulge more details that I </span>
<em>
<span>do not</span>
</em>
<span> want to know.” Jen dug around in her bag for a moment until she pulled out a small handheld machine which she handed to Agatha. “It’s a fetal heart rate monitor so you can check in on him between visits.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jen! You did not have to do this!” She gasped in awe. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Please! It was only like $50, and if it keeps me out of your sex life it was worth every penny.” Jen scoffed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright, dinner’s ready, come and get it!” Rio called from the kitchen. “You, park it! I’ll bring you a plate.” She insisted, pointing to Agatha who slumped back down in the armchair. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Now I know Agatha had nothing to do with this food, it looks and smells amazing!” Jen complimented, practically drooling at the selection.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey!” Agatha bit in protest</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s alright, my love, you can’t be good at everything!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“HEY!” She shouted, shocked at Rio’s honesty</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh you let her cook for you?” Jen snickered as she plated her food.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We both agreed it was a mistake and ended up ordering pizza.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Smart move! Hey, I’ve been meaning to ask, when are we doing your baby shower?” Jen pried as she returned to the couch.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We’re not!” Agatha snapped</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh come on, don’t you still need like…a ton of shit?” Jen asked, shaking her head in astonishment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I have no problem collecting things myself. I don’t need some pastel hellscape party populated by people I consider acquaintances at best oohing and awing over how big I’ve gotten or guesstimating when I’m going to squeeze him out. Even if they are bringing free shit I’d still have to sit there and pretend to fawn over whatever crap they decided to buy.” Agatha grumbled as she took the plate of food from Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It doesn’t have to be like that if you don’t want it to be, and I think it would be more helpful than you realize to not have to worry about finding half the stuff you still need.” Jen retorted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She has a point, cariño.” Rio said as she handed Agatha her plate earning her a glare. “One less thing to stress about, like the doctor suggested.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Right, but if the party itself stresses me out then it’s a moot point.” Agatha challenged</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why would it stress you out? I thought you loved being the center of attention!” Jen snickered</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not like this, it’s very…performative.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But isn’t that what you do best?” Jen chuckled to which Agatha scowled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Only when it comes to money. Me? My personal life? No thank you!” Agatha explained through a mouthful of food. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What if I were to throw you the party, my love? I plan the whole thing, you just have to show up and look cute, easy right? You won’t have to talk with anyone if you don’t want to.” Rio suggested trying to sound as harmless as possible.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re all so insistent about this.” Agatha sighed facetiously </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah because it’s a good idea!” Jen snapped annoyedly </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t even know when we would have this, I have so much going on with this court date and preparing for Mayfest.” Agatha countered, hoping there was still a chance to talk them out of it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, right, how’s that going?” Alice inquired.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s been driving me insane, but thankfully we’re finally over the marketing hurdle. We found a company that will be able to work aggressively within our budget, given we really only have a month to promote it. We’ve been cycling social media ads for the time being with the few items Freddy did create but, given the scale this year, we really need to make sure there’s a good turnout. Now we just have to hire a management company by the end of the week so we can submit updated festival plans to the city for road closures and shit by the first of the month. It’s a nightmare, but if we pull this off it’ll change everything.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The high blood pressure is making sense now.” Jen nodded as she cleared her plate. “Again I think this is just more of a reason to have a shower. When are you going to have time to get all this shit before the baby comes?” Jen continued prodding. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Online ordering is a marvel, Jen. I’ll have to show you!” Agatha brushed off sarcastically. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen flashed Agatha an unamused look, “Ok then, when are you going to have time to </span>
<em>
<span>order </span>
</em>
<span>all this shit?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re really not going to drop this are you?” Agatha groaned as she dropped her fork to her plate with a clank. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If it comes to it I’ll make it a surprise party and you’re not going to know when it happens.” Jen threatened</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t you dare!” Agatha gasped</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Or you can decide on a date and let the three of us plan something.” Jen offered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“FINE! No stupid games, I’m talking to </span>
<em>
<span>no one</span>
</em>
<span>, and I’m not opening one damn present!” Agatha spat, resigning herself at last. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ok, Agatha, we’ll figure something out! Maybe close to the end of April, before the festival but after the court date.” Rio suggested.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Whatever, I am not acknowledging my part in this until the day of.” Agatha insisted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fair enough, cariño.” Rio chuckled nervously as she glanced back at Jen and Alice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can you hold this for me?” she held out her plate to Rio “I have to go to the bathroom again, he’s dancing on my bladder.” She pressed a hand to her side as she slid to the edge of the chair. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Of course, do you need help up?” Rio asked as she grabbed the plate and stood to help.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, no I’ve got it! I’m not useless yet.” She waved Rio off as she heaved herself from the chair and waddled down the hallway.  </span>
<span>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as she disappeared through the door Rio leaned over to whisper to Jen and Alice. “So I’m thinking maybe we do something small, a lunch or dinner or something. Keep it short. I really don’t want to overwhelm her. I mean, she seems less keen on the idea than I thought she would be.” She explained worriedly </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, Agatha is not a party person, especially if it’s for her. I didn’t know when her birthday was the first five years I knew her because she never celebrated it and refused to tell me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I was also thinking, considering her stance on presents, maybe we can try and collect things ahead of time and I can set up the baby’s room for her, show it to her afterwards or something?” Rio suggested desperately.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How exactly would you do that if you’re at the party?” Jen frowned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Right…It would probably have to be before the party.” Rio bit her lip concernedly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are we doing this while she’s at work or something?” Alice asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oooo bad idea. She is not going to want to do this after work.” Jen warned </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Then we’ll need a distraction.” At that suggestion Rio and Alice zeroed in on Jen.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Me? Why do I have to be the distraction?” Jen whined.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s either that or put together a bunch of baby shit.” Rio shrugged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen rolled her eyes as she bit under her breath, “Fine I’ll be the distraction.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Take her out for a girls day or something before the party. Get her as relaxed and amiable as possible.” Alice proposed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Right, and why don’t I just end world hunger while I’m at it!” Jen scoffed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Making big plans there Jen! Don’t hurt yourself.” Agatha taunted as she reappeared in the hallway, a hand braced against the crest of her stomach. “What were you three talking about?” She asked as she eased back down into the chair.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Just sorting out details for the party. You ok?” Rio asked, seeing her grimace and groan as she sat back down.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fine, just braxton hicks, my stomach feels as hard as a rock.” She took a slow breath in and out while she waited for the pressure to pass.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Getting more of those these days?” Jen asked </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Eh, they happen here and there and usually aren’t too bad but every once in a while I’ll get one that’s kind of…intense.” Agatha sighed, still catching her breath. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sounds about right. They’ll likely get more frequent as you get closer. Have you thought anymore about your birth plan?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What’s there to think about? When I go into labor I’ll head to the hospital, you’ll drug me up and I’ll push him out.” Agatha rambled disdainfully</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’ve not looked at a single thing I’ve sent you have you?” Jen scolded, disappointed but not surprised.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, not yet.” Agatha admitted as she took another bite of her food. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why do I even bother?” Jen huffed as she rolled her eyes annoyed, “You’re about to be in for a rude awakening. This shit is not a walk in the park, even if there aren’t any complications. I’m not trying to scare you but, especially with your age and your blood pressure being high, it puts you both at risk. You have to be mentally prepared for whatever may happen!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha pursed her lips in annoyance before shooting a look at Rio who quickly diverted her attention back to her plate, not wanting to get caught in the impending blowback. Then, just as Agatha was about to retort, Alice piped up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know, Jen, maybe you two could get together and talk through things. Help Agatha come up with a plan?” Alice suggested earning her a side eye from Jen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What an excellent idea, Alice! What do you think about that, my love? You and Jen have a girls day, maybe get a few things for the baby, get a better idea of what to expect and plan for?” Agatha stared daggers at Rio before turning to glare at Jen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen sighed as she turned back to face Agatha “What do you say, Harkness?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha raised her eyebrows in suspicion. “You </span>
<em>
<span>want</span>
</em>
<span> to do this?” She asked skeptically</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen grinned through clenched teeth. “Yes.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why does this feel like a trap?” She asked, looking around at all of them watching her intently. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes darted to Jen and Alice before returning to Agatha, “No! No trap. We just want to make sure you’re as ready as you can be.” she insisted reassuringly </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ah! So you </span>
<em>
<span>are </span>
</em>
<span>all in on this together!” Agatha jumped in sleuthing pride.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No you stubborn bitch! We’re not </span>
<em>
<span>in </span>
</em>
<span>on anything! We just want what’s best for you and the baby.” Jen snapped. “Are you in or out?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fine Jen! Don’t get your panties in a wad! I’m in.” Agatha relented</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck! It’s like pulling teeth just to do something nice for you!” Jen huffed, annoyed at her own tolerance for the lack of gratitude.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I said I’m in, what more do you want?” Agatha spat</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t know, a thank you would be fucking nice!” Jen half-shouted back</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha grumbled as she took another bite of food. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Agatha!” </span>
</em>
<span>Rio scolded under her breath</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes back to Jen. “Thank you, Jennifer. Now can we please talk about anything else?” There was a moment of silence as everyone sat there, feeling the tension in the air as they waited for someone to be brave enough to speak. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Alice started, clearing her throat, “How…how’s your aunt doing?” Alice asked, heroically obliging the request. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Lilia? Oh she’s… she’s doing alright.” Rio chuckled nervously. “Up to her usual shenanigans I’m sure.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Have you talked with her much since everything happened?” Alice continued</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“A bit. She knows Agatha and I have worked things out and is happy for us. To be honest I haven’t really seen her since then. Just trying to focus on us and this guy for the time being.” Rio explained as she rubbed a hand against Agatha’s belly. Agatha smiled lovingly as she placed her hand atop Rio’s. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That must be hard given she’s your only family in the area.” Alice commented. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, she’s my only family.” Rio clarified.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?” Jen and Alice asked in unison</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She’s my only living relative.” Rio explained, “Sorry, I thought we had talked about this?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No we did not!” Jen gasped</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, wow, I didn’t realize! I’m so sorry.” Alice sighed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled. “It’s alright. It’s been that way for a while.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Still, I would imagine that makes it even harder, if things are unresolved between you two.” Alice pressed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s not that they’re unresolved necessarily, at least between us. We’ve had a chance to talk through things and she’s admitted her actions, though well intentioned, were </span>
<em>
<span>misguided </span>
</em>
<span>at best. I would hope, given how serious we’ve become, eventually she and Agatha could sit down and talk things over, but I’m not going to force anything. It’ll happen in its own time.” Rio insisted as she rubbed her thumb reassuringly against the taught surface.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Would you talk with her?” Jen asked, directing her attention to Agatha.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I…I don’t really know. We hadn’t really discussed it before now and I haven’t given it much thought. Honestly, I kind of forgot with everything else going on.” Agatha frowned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Really, it’s not something you need to worry about right now anyway.” Rio assured</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But if she’s like literally your only relative…” Jen started, chuckling in disbelief that Rio would be so calm about such an important issue.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s fine, really! We’re still settling things and that’s what I need to focus on. She understands that.” Rio insisted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you opposed to talking with her?” Jen persisted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha gazed over at Rio. Though she did her best to hold an air of nonchalance, Agatha could see the pain buried behind her eyes. “No, I guess not, assuming she’s remorseful for her actions. It’s not like she could do it again at this point.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you sure?” Rio asked, eyebrows raised in caution. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I mean, I’d love to get an apology but yeah, I’d be open to talking with her. She is your only family after all, even if she makes wildly impulsive decisions and is a bit… eccentric.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sounds like someone else I know.” Jen mumbled under her breath earning a glare from Agatha before she continued. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Honestly, I think she might be the most sane family member between the two of us, which is…well…a low bar, really, but she does clear it, </span>
<em>
<span>barely</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio beamed “That…that would be amazing. I’ll talk with her and see if we can all go out to lunch or something soon. Not until after next week of course!” She assured, squeezing Agatha’s hand in excitement. “She’s going to be thrilled! She’s been asking about you, if everything’s ok and how the baby is doing. I know it didn’t really seem like it but she does care and genuinely wants what’s best for us.” Rio urged, hoping to gain some favor for Lilia in the meantime.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s more than I can say for my mother!” Agatha laughed, surprisingly unbothered by the idea. In truth she liked the idea of having some sort of elder maternal figure in their lives for her son.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know that’s right!” Jen snorted as she finished off her glass of wine before turning to Alice. “You about ready?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You guys headed out?” Rio asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I’ve got an early start and I’ve got to try and hit the gym beforehand. Let us know how things go with your lawyer tomorrow and how things go with your mother next week. I don’t know that I’ll see you again before then!” Jen said as she gathered her things</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh don’t worry, I'm sure I’ll have a saga to tell you.” Agatha grunted as she pulled herself from the chair once again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Please at least read over what I sent you, I promise it’s helpful! And take it easy, as much as you can. You’re in the home stretch here, we want to make it to the finish line.” Jen warned as she leaned in to give Agatha a hug goodbye. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stiffened in the embrace, feeling a cold chill run down her spine at the caution. She knew Jen was only trying to help, but the warning left an ominous pit in her stomach. She flashed Jen an awkward and annoyed half-smile, attempting to keep her composure but couldn’t bring herself to say a thing as they parted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Keep an eye on her, she has a terrible habit of not taking good advice.” Jen gleaned as she moved to say goodbye to Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, don’t worry, I’m all over it!” Rio reassured, giving Jen a quick hug goodbye. “You still down for the game on Monday?” she asked, turning her attention to Alice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What game?” Jen and Agatha asked in unison, side eyeing each other.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio invited me to play in her pick up game on Monday. I wouldn’t say it’s my best sport, but I’m pretty quick and can keep them on their toes.” Alice preened.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She’s going to be my secret weapon.” Rio chuckled as she and Alice high fived.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen snickered, astonished as she side eyed Agatha who shook her head and shrugged in response. “Well, ok then. Hope you two have fun. Have a good night!” and with that they stepped into the night.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As Rio closed the door behind them she could feel Agatha’s eyes on her. She slowly turned, “What?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You and Alice? Seriously?” Agatha snorted in sheer disbelief. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What, she's cool! I thought it’d be fun to hang out.” Rio shrugged innocently. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“When did this happen?” Agatha scrunched her brows in an attempt to understand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We talked a bit about it at karaoke night. We text every so often. She just seems like a nice person.” Rio said matter of factly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You text?” Agatha raised her eyebrows as she smirked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We mostly send each other memes but yeah, she’s become a good friend. She’s your best friend’s girlfriend, it makes sense for us to be friends too.” Rio threw her hands up in honest surrender. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It does…I guess I just wasn’t expecting it. I’m glad you two have hit it off.” Agatha said as she gathered plates and headed towards the kitchen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What are you doing?” Rio asked as she quickly followed her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What does it look like? I’m cleaning up!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No! You don’t need to be doing that, go sit down. I’ll take care of it.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes narrowed at Rio as she took the plates from her hands and nodded her head towards the couch. She let out a defeated sigh, knowing this was a battle she wasn’t likely to win, and resigned herself to the sofa where she was quickly joined by scratchy. She laid down on her side, allowing him to find a comfortable nook at the top of her swollen belly and settle in, purring loudly. As if on cue her son wiggled towards the familiar sound, pressing up towards her ribs. She met his movements with the palm of her hand as another kick pressed firmly against her side. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How’s he doing?” Rio asked as she came to collect the empty wine glasses. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“He seems perfectly happy. I think he likes Scratchy’s purring. He always stirs when it happens.” She smiled down lovingly at the fluffy beast curled in her arms.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Of course! It’s like you attached a motorboat to your belly, I’m sure it’s very interesting. How are you feeling, really?” Rio inquired, unconvinced she had divulged her true state of being. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Bloated, swollen, and very tired.” Agatha admitted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I bet! You’ve had a long day! I was surprised you were still up for dinner with them.” Rio said as she loaded the dishwasher.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well I’d have to eat anyway. I figured they wouldn’t be here long as it is. It was good to see them and catch up, though I wasn’t expecting you all to team up against me!” she groaned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Against you?! Cariño, we were just trying to help. Are you really that upset about having a baby shower?” Rio snorted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The idea makes me nauseated. Who would even come besides you three?” Agatha spat, still not fully convinced of the idea. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, given you’re open to working things out with Lilia I know she'd be delighted to join. Nat and Yelena would definitely make the trip up for it, I bet Hela would tag along with them. Then, of course, your friends from work.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What friends from work? I don’t have any friends at work.” Agatha insisted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Herb I think would probably come. Your friends on the board. We can’t forget Sharon!” Rio began listing</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Absolutely not! I don’t need my colleagues </span>
<em>
<span>that </span>
</em>
<span>involved in my personal life.” Agatha wrinkled her nose in disgust. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fair enough, though I know Sharon is going to be disappointed, she’s been asking about it.” Rio shook her head in disappointment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re joking!” Agatha gasped in disbelief. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not at all! She’s very excited for you! She asked if she should be planning something, I told her to hold off until we’ve talked about it, but I wouldn’t be surprised if they already had something set for you at the office.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh no!” Agatha groaned, pressing her hands against her face in frustration. “We’re going to have to have a talk tomorrow, she must be stopped.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You can’t blame them for being excited and wanting to celebrate with you. You’re having a baby, people want to help and be there to support you, they care about you.” She said as she made her way over to join Agatha on the couch. “Aren’t you excited?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m getting there.” Agatha groaned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What’s holding you back?” Agatha bit the inside of her cheek nervously as fearful thoughts tugged at the back of her mind. “Does it have anything to do with what Jen brought up? Are you nervous?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Of course I’m nervous! A human is going to come out of my body in like three months! I know she thinks I’m just avoiding it but I’m well aware of the potential outcomes, for him and for me, I can’t really control it.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know it’s intimidating but I’m sure talking things over with Jen will set your nerves at ease, she is an expert after all. She’ll get you as prepared as anybody can be.” Rio suggested, guiding a hand soothingly along Agatha’s leg. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If you say so.” Agatha groaned, not quite ready to accept the idea. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We all just want you and the baby to be happy and healthy. Which reminds me, it’s time to take your blood pressure.” Rio patted her leg with a smirk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh, if we must!” Agatha grumbled</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio pried herself from the couch and went to grab the blood pressure monitor. Agatha pushed herself to sit and felt her son roll within her. She inhaled sharply as his foot found a tender spot in her side just as Rio re-entered the room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright, Cariño?” Rio asked, seeing the twinge of pain on her face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m fine, though it feels like he’s running out of room. He always manages to wedge himself into the worst spot these days. I’m pretty sure he’s standing on a kidney.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is that right?” She asked as she sat down next to Agatha. “Are you wreaking havoc in there little one?” Rio hummed against the surface.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I can already tell it’s going to be another long uncomfortable night.” Agatha sighed exhaustedly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not if I can help it!” Rio leaned closer, pressing her hands to either side of the swell. “Knock, knock mister! Can I have your attention please?”She called, rapping her fingers against the surface. At the request she could feel the child shifting and moving under Agatha’s skin. Rio’s eyes grew wide in awe at the sensation as she glanced back at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I think he’s listening for you. It felt like he turned his whole body to hear you better.” Agatha informed her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Wild!” Rio breathed amazed as she continued. “Listen here you little squirt, your mama’s got a big day tomorrow and needs her rest. If you can behave I’ll buy some more of those spicy pickles you like. Deal?” She asked, rubbing her hands gently across the swell. Before long she felt a confident nudge against her palm. “He’s really listening?” She gasped astonished. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not sure that he understands but he definitely recognizes your voice.” Agatha’s heart skipped a beat at the wonder Rio held in this moment. She could see the deep love she already had for this child she barely knew, it was precious and deep, radiating through every cell in her body. She could see days where she would read and share all the knowledge she had acquired. Nights where Rio would hold him close and soothe him back to sleep after a frightening dream. Summers at the beach covered in sand searching for sea shells. Winters warm at home by the fire huddled together on the couch reading late into the night. Their quiet, adoring perfect little family. The kind of family she hadn’t ever dared to dream of now knelt before her, cradling the growing life inside her. She wanted to share every detail of this journey with her.  “</span>
</p><p>
<span>Do you want to try and hear him?” She offered. Rio's eyes widened in excitement as she nodded ecstatically. “The monitor thing Jen brought is over by the chair.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As Rio moved to stand the blood pressure cuff fell to the floor from her lap. “Oh, right. Sorry, I got a little distracted.” She quickly retrieved it and slipped the device onto Agatha’s wrist, turning it on before running over to grab the monitor. “Where are we at?” She asked as she fumbled with the device.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“122/80” Agatha replied as she tore the cuff from her wrist.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Amazing! That’s the best read yet today. Crazy what some rest will do!” Rio applauded as she turned the heart monitor on. “Alright, lift her up!” Rio instructed as she knelt down again in front of Agatha. As Agatha peeled back the hem of her shirt Rio leaned in, pressing a kiss to the swell before squirting a small, heart shaped glob of gel onto the surface. Once the wand made contact with her stomach the screen lit up, clearly reading the rapid beats within but no sound resonated. “Huh, well, that’s a little underwhelming.” Rio scrunched her face in disappointment as she started pressing buttons at random.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned as she reached for the device. “Here, let me see.” She turned the device over in her hands until she found a small wheel on the side that she began to scroll. As the wheel turned under her finger tip the rhythmic sounds of her son’s heartbeat began to grow louder through the small speaker. “There, we just needed to turn the volume up.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Jeeze! And I’m the one who went to medical school.” Rio scoffed as she slapped a hand to her forehead. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, we can’t be good at everything, right dear?” Agatha snickered</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Touché!” Rio chuckled as she took the device back from Agatha. “140, nice and steady.” As she looked down she saw a ripple dance across Agatha’s taught skin. “Woah, and strong! Just like his mama!” She beamed, “Did… did that hurt?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No!” Agatha laughed “it definitely feels weird though.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright little man, that’s enough showing off, time to settle in for the night.” Rio said as she set the monitor down and wiped the residue from Agatha’s stomach with her sleeve before pressing another kiss to the surface. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart swelled with an overwhelming warmth. How could she have been so lucky, so fortunate to have found this indescribably wonderful person exactly when she needed her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thank you.” She uttered as she lowered her shirt. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“For what?” Rio chuckled as she helped Agatha up from the couch. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“For everything. I…I couldn’t imagine doing any of this without you.” she admitted in a rare moment of vulnerability.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Of course! Anything for you, my love.” She leaned in, drawing Agatha’s lips into hers. She filled the touch with every drop of tenderness and love her body could summon. As she pulled away gently she caught Agatha’s swimming, crystal blue irises and wiped away the single tear that had fallen. “I am forever grateful that fate brought you to me!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>————————————————</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The next day as Agatha left for work she was pleasantly surprised to not be greeted by another terrible gift from Evanora. She had enough to occupy her mind between all the urgent work still needed for the festival and their impending meeting with Victoria to sort through their plan for dealing with her lawsuit that afternoon. And, thanks to whatever magic Rio had worked, she had been able to have a restful night cradled in her arms as her son rested peacefully within her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The day passed by quickly as she was pulled from meeting to meeting, reviewing companies, interviewing vendors, and revising plans to submit to the city. Thanks to Sharon she had been able to manage it all and somehow find time for lunch in the midst of all the chaos. As her final meeting drew to a close she was practically counting down the seconds until Rio would come to pick her up to head to meet the lawyer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We’ve accounted for a second stage at the rear of the building and the west side entrance will host the murals and interactive light display. Food and craft vendors will be located along the street leading up to the main entrance and on either side of the East corridor. The fire marshal has aligned to stationing performers along the main entrance so long as they’re not blocking any of the exits. Then, of course we’ll have the fire department and paramedics stationed at both the front and rear of the building. I think we have all our bases covered. Am I forgetting anything?” Herb asked as he ran through the final plans. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are we still keeping the entry hall open to the public throughout all of this?” Agatha questioned, raising an eyebrow in concern.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s the plan.” Herb replied as his focus remained on the map in front of him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How exactly are we going to accommodate for the sound during the performances in the main theatre, let alone account for anyone who has or hasn’t purchased a ticket?” She glared, annoyed at having to point out the obvious flaws in this plan. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I have some ideas but that is still something we’ll have to work out with the management company. We’ll definitely have to get creative. Speaking of, have you had a chance to read over the final proposals?” Herb asked eagerly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I skimmed through them during lunch. I think there’s only one that’s going to be able to pull together what we need in time but it’s not going to be cheap. It’s nearly $25,000 over what we were planning to spend, which wouldn’t be an issue if we hadn’t had to hire that marketing company.” Agatha sassed, reminding him of their not so unfortunate loss.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is there anything we can afford to cut?” Herb pried, hoping to find some leeway. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“A few things here and there but the largest cost is going to be staffing and with all that we have planned we can’t afford to skimp on workers. This proposal at least includes the additional security we will absolutely need given how open this whole thing is. The last thing we want is for any sort of disturbance to break out and ruin the whole series of events we’ve painstakingly planned.” Agatha explained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What does finance say?” Herb asked, undeterred.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s really a choice of do we invest everything now in this event and likely forgo a guest artist in the winter season or take several steps back, pair down the vendors to the one street and take out the second stage to come in under the currently allotted budget.” Agatha proposed, though she could see the hesitancy in Herb’s expression.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know me, I’m going to say risk it because I think we’ll get more return on this investment. If we lose a guest artist in the winter, so be it.” He threw his hands up in surrender. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re really willing to lose a guest artist we’ve already had sign a contract?” She pressed, reminding him of their current obligation.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If it comes to it I’ll talk with legal and see what our options are there. We’ve come too far not to do this properly.” Herb insisted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Just then there was a small knock at the door before Sharon appeared in the doorway. “Ms. Harkness, your ride is here for your next appointment.” she whispered cheerily. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thank you Sharon. Tell her I’ll be out in a minute.” She replied as she waved her out. Sharon nodded before quietly closing the door behind her. “If you’re comfortable taking that risk send the agreement over to legal for one final read through before we lock in. I’ll have Sharon take the plans over to the city this afternoon so hopefully we’ll get the approval by the end of the week. I’ll let finance know our decision once everything is signed.” She said as she began gathering her things.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It will be worth it in the end, I promise! I know it’s been no small feat on your part to get to this point so thank you for everything you’ve done to get us here.” Herb praised, hoping to get some excitement out of her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, it is my job. You know this is only the beginning right? Once everything is settled is when the real work starts, actually making it all happen and hoping it comes together in time.” Her eyebrows raised in caution as she heaved herself from the chair.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I do and I understand the pressure that puts on you so please don’t hesitate to delegate. Let me know what’s needed to make this as easy on you as possible.” Herb insisted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“As long as everyone has their shit together it should all fall into place. I don’t want to be chasing people down to do what they’re supposed to do. That goes double for the artists and musicians.” She warned as she made her way to the door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You have my word, I’ll stay on top of them. Take care, I’ll see you tomorrow with a signed agreement.” Herb said as he closed the door behind her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a deep sigh as she headed down the hallway towards her office. She was glad to have aligned on a management company and have the finalized festival plans in hand but now her mind was swimming with the ever growing list of tasks that were now laid before her. It was like battling a hydra, for every feat she accomplished 3 or 4 more popped up in its place. Though the end was in sight it was clear that the demands would only increase as the festival grew closer. As she neared Sharon’s desk she could hear Rio’s effervescent laugh echoing down the hallway, the light, bubbling joy already setting her swirling mind at ease. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What’s got you so giddy?” She asked with a smirk as she rounded the corner, finding Rio perched atop Sharon’s desk. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“There you are, my love!” Rio shouted as her face lit up with joy at seeing Agatha. “Sharon was just telling me about her grandson’s first soccer game.” she explained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“He got too excited when he finally got the ball and ended up scoring into his own team’s  goal.” Sharon elaborated. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Cute.” Agatha snorted as she made her way to her office, breezing past them both.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you ready to go?” Rio asked as she hopped up from Sharon’s desk to follow her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nearly, just putting away some things and then I’ll need to run to the restroom on our way out.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why don’t I go grab the car and meet you out front?” Rio suggested</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That works, I still have to go over some stuff with Sharon anyway.” Agatha shrugged in agreement.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright, I’ll see you downstairs in a few!” Rio snuck a kiss onto Agatha’s cheek before bounding out the door. Agatha couldn’t help but smile after her as she headed back out to Sharon’s desk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Here are the final plans we need to submit to the city. Can you drop them off on your way home today? Their office closes at five so you’ll want to head out soon. I also need to set up another meeting with finance for tomorrow. We’ve made our final selection and I’ll need to give them a heads up that we will indeed be going over budget so we’ll need to review some of our plans for the rest of the year.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Of course, dear! Is there anything else you need?” Sharon asked as she took the file from Agatha.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, actually. Rio had mentioned you were asking about a baby shower?” Agatha’s eyes narrowed with warning suspicion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I…yes, well…I hadn’t heard anything” Sharon babbled, feeling the weight of Agatha’s stare. “and…I know at least a few people here have expressed interest in throwing something together for you…” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Really?” Agatha frowned in skeptical disbelief. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I warned them that it might not be something you’re up for with everything else going on so the suggestion was to see if you had a registry or anything else in place that people could contribute to instead.” she rushed to explain. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And you didn’t think to ask me directly?” Agatha asked, pursing her lips in annoyed disappointment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I…I just happened to catch Rio when she brought you lunch the other day. It was top of mind. I’m so sorry if I overstepped.” Sharon’s eyes began to well with fear and regret. The poor woman was quickly crumbling under her interrogation and for once Agatha chose to take pity on her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, it's…it's alright. I appreciate the thought, but that is the last thing I want. I don’t need these people involved in my personal life any more than they already are. Just let them know the best gift they can give me is to buckle down and make sure this festival goes off without a hitch. I don’t need to be putting out any unnecessary fires.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes…yes, of course! I completely understand. I’ll make sure that’s clearly communicated.” Sharon sighed in relief that she hadn’t just been chewed out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good. I’ll see you bright and early tomorrow then.” Agatha slid on her sunglasses and turned to leave.    </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>—----------------------------------------</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“How was your day, my love?” Rio asked as they set off for their meeting.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Exhausting as usual but I think we’re in a good place with everything. How about you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Relatively uneventful which I’ll take any day of the week. I did get to talk with Lilia, she’s looking forward to talking with you. I suggested we meet up next weekend, depending on how you’re feeling of course.” Agatha could hear the excitement in her voice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That should be fine as long as she’s not going to pull any stunts this time.” She smirked knowingly at Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I warned her to be on her best behavior and she seemed amiable to the idea so I think we’re in the clear.” Rio smiled, “How are you feeling about this meeting?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a deep sigh as she shifted her mental gears to the task ahead. “I’m interested to hear what Val has to say. None of this makes sense, why would she go through all that trouble to get me to sign the documents and take possession of the house if she was just going to sue me for it?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Exactly! And where did she even get this new document? The whole thing is suspicious to say the least. Between that and the presents I can’t understand what her end goal is.” Rio shook her head in irritated confusion.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“To torture me one way or another. That’s always been her goal. For whatever reason she can never just leave me be.” Agatha rolled her eyes in annoyance.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We’re going to figure that out one way or another, I promise.” Rio reassured, grabbing Agatha’s hand and bringing it to her lips for a kiss. “Having her hovering over you like this is only adding more stress for you and the baby. Speaking of, when was the last time you checked your blood pressure?” Rio glanced over at Agatha with a sly smile across her lips. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, “Ugh, not since this morning before I left. I accidentally left the cuff on the counter.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know, I thought this looked familiar.” Rio smirked as she pulled the cuff out of the center console. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh…seriously?” Agatha whined at seeing the device. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, seriously.” Rio chuckled, “Go ahead, let's see where we’re at.” she insisted as she handed the device over to Agatha.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She reluctantly secured it around her wrist before turning it on then laid her head back against the headrest and closed her eyes. She took a few calming breaths before the monitor beeped. “125/80” she announced as she ripped the cuff from her wrist and threw it on the floor before laying back once again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head in consideration. “Ok, not great but also not the worst it’s been. I wouldn’t say it’s unexpected, given the day, but we’ve got to work on getting you to relax.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I am relaxed.” She grumbled, opening one eye to glare at Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Maybe like meditation or something?” Rio continued, ignoring the side eye.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mediation my ass” she mumbled under her breath</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Have you ever tried it?” Rio asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Once and I did not enjoy it!” Agatha groused</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Then it’s definitely worth another shot. We can do it together to start out.” Rio suggested encouragingly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I can think of a few other things we could do together that would be far more stress relieving than sitting still and listening to endless ambient music.” Agatha proposed as her hand wandered down to Rio’s leg. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh that is definitely on the table, but I was thinking more of what you might be able to incorporate throughout the day when you have stressful moments that pop up. Like having to meet with your lawyer over what I’m sure is a frivolous lawsuit.” She elaborated as they pulled into a parking space outside the law office. “You ready for this?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I can’t tell if it’s going to make me feel better or worse but I’m ready to get this over with.” Agatha sighed as she started to get out of the car.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As they entered the brick business complex Agatha could already feel anger and frustration bubbling within her. On the way up in the elevator she bit her cheek in annoyance, stewing over the fact that her mother had gone to such lengths that she had to take time out of her day to deal with her bullshit. Sensing her irritation Rio placed a hand against her back and began rubbing calming circles in an attempt to soothe her nerves. Agatha sighed leaning into the touch as she rested her head against Rio’s shoulder for comfort. Rio smiled as she glanced over at Agatha, her eyes closed as she let herself succumb to the embrace. Despite the pressure of the situation, they were each grateful for this brief moment of peace. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>When at last they stepped through the glass doors to Valentina’s office they were greeted by a bubbly young 20-something who dropped her phone and whatever app she was doomscrolling on to pop up from her desk and acknowledge them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey! You must be Ms. Harkness! I’m Ali, so nice to meet you. Val’s wrapping up another meeting but I’ll let her know you’re here. Can I get either of you something to drink while you're waiting? Tea, coffee, Bubbly?” She prattled, clearly having had one to many energy drinks for how late it was in the day.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No thank you, I’m fine.” Agatha grumbled, taken aback by her youthful exuberance. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, I’m good. Thanks!” Rio replied with a smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Cool! Then I’ll be right back, feel free to have a seat and get comfortable. She’ll be out to get you in a few minutes.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha flashed Rio a cringing smile as they moved to the plush array of waiting chairs. She collapsed into the nearest chair with a grunt, before crossing her arms around her bump where her son was practically swimming laps within her, the movement aligning with the nervous energy she was doing her best to contain. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio settled into the chair next to her, her eyes carefully observing the building tension hovering around her. The way her foot bounced in rhythm to soundless music, the tapping of her fingers on her arms, the way she was practically chewing a hole into her own lips. She hated the distress this whole situation caused her. She stretched a hand across to rest on Agatha’s knee, pouring calm and stillness into the limb. </span>
</p><p>
<span>At the touch, Agatha released an arm and clutched at Rio's hand, aching for her steady grounding presence to keep her tethered to the moment instead of lost in the chaos that her mind was spinning. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Before long the office door opened once again revealing Valentina. A shorter woman with wavy shoulder length dark brown hair that featured her signature streak of silver at the front which swooped down framing her sharp features. Her well fitted navy pantsuit gave the air of the no-nonsense lawyer she was but the smile she gave Agatha and Rio was warm and reassuring, providing Agatha with a sense of calming confidence as they stood to meet her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha! So good to see you again, though I wish it was under different circumstances.” Valentina leaned in to give Agatha a quick hug. “And look at you! I had no idea! Congratulations!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, thank you.” Agatha replied bashfully as she ghosted a hand along the swell.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And who have you brought with you?” Valentina asked, glancing at Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“This is my girlfriend, Rio.” She turned introducing her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nice to meet you!” Rio said as she took Val’s hand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, if you’ll follow me we’ll head to my office and sort through some things.” Valentina turned abruptly, setting a brisk pace. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Val led them through the doors and down a long hallway until they reached her office at the end. The room was spacious with floor to ceiling windows on the right hand side overlooking a park just below. The paneled walls held an array of degrees and artwork tastefully arranged around the room. In the center sat a large mahogany desk with a few papers strewn about near the computer. Behind the desk on either side were immense matching wooden bookshelves filled to the brim with volumes of law books. In between them, bathed in the light of a single wall sconce was an enormous painting of Lady Justice carrying scales and brandishing a sword. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Please, make yourselves comfortable!” Val insisted as she closed the door behind them and rounded her desk to sit across from them. “So I’ve had a chance to review the documents your mother’s lawyer sent over but I want to hear from you first about the situation. Can you tell me a bit about what has led up to this moment?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, you remember a few months back when I sent you those documents my mother and her lawyer had given me?” Val nodded politely, encouraging her to continue. “I did sign them and eventually took possession of the home. Rio and I traveled to Boston to sort through the stuff that was in the house and sold most everything in an estate sale. Well she showed up to that and ended up causing a scene and we had to remove her from the premises. She wasn’t happy that I was selling everything, including the house, so that’s why, I assume, she’s trying to pull this stunt now.” Agatha explained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The scene she caused was attacking Agatha, by the way.” Rio clarified</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Excuse me?” Val asked, eyes bulging in stunned confusion as she looked between the two of them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “It wasn’t like that. She just slapped me.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Were there any witnesses and did you file a police report?” Val asked as she furiously began scribbling notes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I along with about 10-15 other people witnessed it. The police were called so there may be an incident report but she didn’t want to press charges.” Rio clarified</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s…unfortunate but I understand. How recent was this?” Val continued in her questioning though her hand never moved from the paper. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“A few months ago? I didn’t really think anything of it until you called. I should have figured she would retaliate eventually one way or another. She’s relentless.” Agatha groaned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m so sorry you’re having to deal with this. While it won’t be easy I do believe we have a strong chance of getting this dismissed next week. With that said, there are a few things I do want to go over with you.” Val shuffled a few folders around on her desk until she found what she was looking for and handed a file over to Agatha. “This is a copy of the document they submitted with the suit. I want to bring your attention to a few things. For one, this looks like a revised document. While that can still be completely legitimate, the date of the revisions has raised some suspicions. This seems to have been aligned to barely a week before your grandfather’s passing.” Val noted, circling the date for her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha could feel her throat dry and tighten as she attempted to swallow away the lump that had formed in her throat. She hadn’t thought much of her grandfather's passing but seeing the date had stirred a host of complicated feelings within her. “I see,” she choked out, “and…what would that mean for our defense, exactly?” she asked as her eyes carefully scanned the document.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Given that timing it definitely brings into question his testamentary capacity.” Val said, matter of factly, as if the case had already been won.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Meaning?” Rio asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Was he even competent enough to know what he was agreeing to at the time? I’ve looked into it a bit and he was under hospice care for his last few months. I’m not entirely sure what mental state he was in but I don’t know many 95 year olds on their deathbed that retain their full cognitive capabilities. That, along with the fact that she and her lawyer were the ones who presented you with the original documents weakens their claims.” She elaborated</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thats been my question. Why did they even involve Agatha in the first place if they had this document?” Rio asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’d been wondering the same thing myself. My best guess is someone had misplaced or misfiled this document and they had to comply with what was on file at the time of his death. Now having recovered it she wants to pursue her claim.” Val reasoned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“But you do think this is a real document, not something she forged?” Rio questioned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That was my initial thought but the signature, to a reasonable extent, matches that of your grandfather. He did sign this.” Val confirmed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced over the document in her hand again and again as she recalled the original conversation with her mother. “</span>
<em>
<span>There are a few items I would like to collect...</span>
</em>
<span>” She mumbled to herself</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What was that, my love?” Rio asked, placing a hand on her arm to draw her attention back into the room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She had been so insistent about me signing the documents and going to the house. This must have been what she was after!” Agatha exclaimed as the dots finally clicked into place.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ah, that very well may have been the case! With you listed as the beneficiary she would not have been able to gain access to the property without your permission.” Val explained</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What a conniving little cunt!” Rio scoffed in disbelief</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Now, beyond getting this dismissed,” Val continued, ignoring the brash remark, “Are you wanting to pursue a counter suit? I will let you know, based on what you’ve told me, you would likely have a solid case.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t know that I want to give her the satisfaction of that attention.” Agatha grumbled as she slammed the folder back down on the desk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I can’t blame you; however, I would really like you to consider it. We’d have until Friday to file and it would likely get resolved the same day so it’s not like you would have to return to court and see her again.” Val urged.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s more of the fact that I don’t want anything from her other than for her to leave me alone. I’m so tired of dealing with her incessant prodding and poking into my life!” she whimpered in growing frustration.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That can be built into the request. It would be more difficult for her to appeal that type of order as well and it would likely come with heavy penalties, up to and including jail time.” Val clarified</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I think that’s more what we’re looking for.” Rio replied as she reached for Agatha’s hand in comfort. “Her constant harassment of Agatha is adding additional stress at a time when she needs rest and peace for her and the baby’s health.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How constant are we talking?” Val asked, her eyebrows raised with piqued interest as she drew her pen into her hand again, ready to take notes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha and Rio exchanged glances. “She’s been sending </span>
<em>
<span>gifts</span>
</em>
<span>.” Agatha admitted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ok, interesting. Can you elaborate?” she asked, once again scribbling furiously</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The last few days I’ve received a series of…</span>
<em>
<span>gifts, </span>
</em>
<span>for the baby. A stuffed animal, a bible, a christening gown. All of which have found their way into the trash.” Agatha explained</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Huh, interesting. How exactly is she going about this?” Val questioned without ceasing her notetaking. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The first one showed up at my office. The second one tried to and I refused the delivery so she sent it to my house along with a third one the next day.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And when did this start?” Val continued in her questioning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Last Friday. They’ve been showing up almost daily. So far nothing's appeared today but there’s still time.” Agatha replied</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s… </span>
<em>
<span>convenient</span>
</em>
<span>.” Val commented, flashing her eyes in knowing concern.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How do you mean?” Rio asked, her face scrunched in curious concern.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, that’s the day after we had received our court date. Not that it means anything but the timing is…interesting.” Val reasoned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It does feel like an ominous threat. It’s like her way of intimidating Agatha, letting her know she’s still keeping my tabs on her.” Rio explained, watching Agatha sitting in silent contemplation, clearly working through all this new information.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Had you told her about the pregnancy when she came to you in Boston?” Val asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, actually, at the time </span>
<em>
<span>I </span>
</em>
<span>didn’t even know I was pregnant.” Agatha whispered, her mind still transfixed on the lengths Evanora was going through to torture her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She would have had no way of knowing if she wasn’t stalking her.” Rio insisted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I see.” Val said as she continued to write. “I hate to be insistent upon this but I would be remiss if I didn’t bring up the counter suit again. Given your concerns I feel it would be the best way to resolve these issues with your mother. With all of this information we’ll get her suit dismissed and likely be able to institute a protective order.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What do you say, cariño?” Rio asked, rubbing her hand along Agatha’s arm.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced back at Rio, seeing caring encouragement in her eyes. “If it gets her out of my life once and for all then let’s do it.” she agreed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fantastic! I’ll get the paperwork submitted to the court tomorrow. Do you have any other questions for me?” Val asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, I don’t believe so.” Agatha shook her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright! Then I’ll see you bright and early at 8:00 at the courthouse a week from today. If there’s anything that pops up in the meantime don’t be afraid to reach out.” Val offered as she rose from her desk to see them out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thank you as always for your help. Hopefully this will be the end of it.” Agatha replied as she and Rio headed for the door.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll do my best to ensure it is. You two have a good night!” Val said as she closed the door behind them.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>They walked in silence back down the hallway and through to reception. Ali chipperly waved them out to which Agatha didn’t respond and Rio merely smiled. As they stepped back into the elevator Rio reached out, catching Agatha’s hand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s going to be alright, my love.” She murmured, hoping to soften the anxieties she could see written across her face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, letting a weak smile dance across her lips. “It will be…eventually.” she replied as she turned to take in Rio’s glowing amber eyes. “I have you after all.” she hummed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart fluttered at that. The smile that radiated from her was impossible to contain. “Always, my love.” She leaned in, taking Agatha’s lips tenderly into hers, savoring the sweet moment between them in the midst of this debacle. As the elevator dinged their arrival she pulled away, taking Agatha once again by the hand and led them both out of the building. Once they approached the car Agatha could sense something amiss in the air around them. As Agatha moved to enter the vehicle she froze suddenly, her heart pounding as fury began to quickly build within her. Blinded by rage she let out a curdling shriek, </span>
</p><p>
<span>“AHHHHhhhhhhAAHHHHHAAAH!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>In a panic Rio rushed to her side. “Agatha, what is it!? Are you ok? Is it the baby?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She fucking knew I was here!” Agatha shouted as she began to pace.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What!?” Rio panted, her nerves still set on edge by the reaction.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“My mother, she knew I would be here!” She elaborated as she pointed to what had sparked her anger. Rio turned, eyes following the direction of Agatha’s finger to land on another carefully wrapped present sitting on the ground just beside the passenger door. </span>

<p>
<span>The day broke too early that morning. It had been a restless night of tossing and turning and Agatha’s mind was awash with anxious anticipation about the day ahead in court. Seeing her mother again after all she had been putting her through, and the now nightly routine of getting up every few hours to relieve herself as her son continued to take up every available space within her left her depleted and overwhelmed. When the alarm sounded she whimpered with exhaustion as she quickly silenced it then rolled back over to snuggle into Rio’s side. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Morning, cariño.” Rio grumbled sleepily as she wrapped her arms around her. “Did you get any sleep last night?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh, barely. My mind was working a million miles a minute then every time I finally got comfortable I had to get up to pee. I don’t know how I’m going to do two more months of this!” She groaned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well hopefully after we kick your mothers ass in court today it’ll help quiet your mind.” She leaned down, kissing the crown of Agatha’s head. “As for this little guy…All the trouble you’re causing!” she brushed her hand against the swell, feeling him stretch and move as if waking for the day with them. “It won’t be much longer, my love, then we’ll get to hold him in our arms.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It can’t come soon enough!” She grumbled as she buried herself deeper into Rio’s side. Rio squeezed her in close, peppering kisses on her head before she began shifting to rise. “No! Just ten more minutes please!” Agatha whined as her grip tightened around Rio’s waist. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ten more minutes? I don’t know, I can already hear Scratchy trying to break down the door.” Rio chuckled </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“He can wait, I just need you for a little while longer.” Agatha batted her icy blue eyes up at Rio, her lip bending down into a pitiful pout. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh really? You’re going to use that face on me?” Rio snorted, well aware that this was a battle she was quickly losing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is it working?” Agatha’s pout broke at the corners into a smirk. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How about this, we can snuggle for a few more minutes if you meditate with me.” Rio offered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s face fell into a blank, annoyed stare. “Really?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We’ll be laying here anyway, we have a tough day ahead. Now’s the perfect time to calm the mind and focus our energies.” Rio smiled, closing her eyes as if blissfully at peace. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes “If it buys me ten more minutes in bed with you I’ll do it.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio reached for her phone and scrolled to find a guided meditation. Soon the sounds of crashing waves poured out through the speakers as a deep soothing voice called for them to close their eyes and breathe deeply. Always one to be defiant, Agatha’s eyes remained open and drifted up to observe Rio. Her sleep tossed hair curled and tangled around her face, the rosy flushness of her cheeks which still bore the slight imprint of where the pillow had been pressed against her face, the subtle flair of her nostrils and the rise and fall of her chest as she breathed in time with the instructor. She was a vision of warm serenity and to be wrapped in her arms, sheer bliss. As her gaze drifted down to Rio’s plump, delicate lips she caught a smile breaking through. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can feel you staring.” Rio mumbled. “Close your eyes, Agatha.” she drew her hand up and slid her fingers down Agatha’s face, forcing her eyes closed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha at last accepted her fate, resting her head on Rio’s chest as she took a deep breath in time with her. As the waves continued to crash and Rio’s heartbeat sounded in her ear, she could feel a sense of calm begin to creep over her. As she continued to breathe slowly, deeply, inhaling Rio’s warm, earthy fragrance, the knot of anxiety in her own chest started to loosen. She felt safe and at home cradled against her and she couldn’t imagine ever leaving this moment. Slowly, the waves began to fade and a hushed quiet filled the room, the only sounds remaining were the soft pulses of their breathing and Scratchy's urgent pawing at the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How do you feel, my love?” Rio’s voice washed over her in a whisper as she felt her lips brush against her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Like I could fall asleep. Do we have to get up? I don’t want to go!” Agatha whined </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know, cariño,” Rio hitched a finger under Agatha’s chin, drawing her face upward as she pressed a kiss to her lips. “But we must! Don’t want to keep your mother waiting.” She chuckled as she pried herself from Agatha’s grip and rolled out of bed.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh I still can’t fucking believe she’s doing this! Why did I have to be cursed with such a horrible mother?” Agatha groused as she pounded her fists into the bed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well hopefully after today the curse will be broken. I’m going to hop in the shower really quick then whip up breakfast. Anything specific sound good?” Rio asked as she padded over to sit beside Agatha at the edge of the bed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do we have any more of that bread we got at the market on Sunday?” Agatha asked, biting the tip of her finger as she pondered what she wanted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If you didn’t have a midnight snack then I believe we have a couple slices left.” Rio replied</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ok then” Agatha smiled deliciously as she began to rattle off her request, “toast with some of the guacamole you made last night with two eggs, some of those spicy pickled peppers and onions and top it with maple syrup and chocolate chips.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio snickered to herself, “Alright, anything else?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If we have any of those frozen cherries will you make us a smoothie?” She added, biting her lip and batting her eyes in playful pleading. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Us, huh?” Rio snorted as she rested a hand on Agatha’s belly. “Does he want it with the chocolate almond milk like last time?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ooo! Yes and cinnamon!” Agatha gleamed with delight.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Of course!” Rio smiled as she pressed a kiss to the swell. “Hungry this morning, are we?” She murmured as she guided her hands along the surface, feeling his morning stretches just beneath Agatha’s skin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Starving, actually.” Agatha grunted as she tried to sit up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, then I’d better get moving!” Rio chuckled as she helped Agatha sit at the edge of the bed. “You good?” She asked, seeing her twinge in discomfort. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, just letting things settle. Go on, I’ll be in in a minute, I’m going to feed Scratchy.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I can go feed him now if that’s easier.” Rio offered</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, I’ve got this!” She insisted as she rose to stand, wobbling a bit as she adjusted to her center of gravity. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Careful!” Rio urged as she reached to hold Agatha steady. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio, I’m fine! Go take a shower!” Agatha insisted as she brushed her away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright, alright! I’ll be out in a flash.” She winked before sneaking a kiss onto Agatha’s cheek and then scurried away. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha waddled down the hallway wincing a bit as her joints creaked and popped, waking with each step. Scratchy followed closely behind, mewling loudly as he waited impatiently for his breakfast. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know mister! I’m working on it, if you hadn’t noticed I’m moving a little slower these days.” Scratchy replied with an insistent rippling screech as he butted his head against her legs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Here!” she groaned as she squatted down, placing the bowl in front of him. “You’re going to have to learn some patience here sir! You’re not going to be the center of attention for much longer.” She warned him as she stroked her hand through his fur, wrapping his fluffy tail around her finger. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She moved to stand, having to grip the edge of the counter to pull herself up. She groaned as she straightened, feeling the familiar ache in her back as her son rolled to press at her side. Her hand met his movement as the other worked to relieve the tension in her back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning, little bug. You have enough room in there?” She hummed, rubbing circles against the surface. “Are you as ready for this day to be over as I am?” She felt a resounding nudge press against her palm. “I know, your grandmother is a piece of work isn’t she!” She shuddered as the word left her mouth. “Don’t worry, this should be the only time you ever have to deal with her. We just have to get through today.” She said more to herself than him as she waddled back down the hallway. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>A shower and three outfit changes later Agatha burst from the bedroom in a flowy, long-sleeved lilac dress, unzipped and hovering on the edge of her shoulders. Her cascading hair was still damp in places and half pinned up on the left side as if she had started to fix it and gave up halfway through. She had one shoe on and was hobbling down the hallway towards Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Need help, cariño?” Rio chuckled seeing her disheveled state. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes! I can’t find the other shoe, I can’t get this fucking dress zipped, and my hair just isn’t cooperating today! If this is any sign of how the rest of the day is going to go I’m going to call it now and crawl back into bed.” Agatha sighed shakily, on the verge of tears. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mi amor! Come here!” Rio urged soothingly with outstretched arms. Agatha stumbled forward and let herself be wrapped into Rio’s embrace. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t think I can do this!” She shuddered into her shoulder. “It’s all too much right now!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Take a deep breath.” Rio urged. They breathed in synchronicity as Rio held her close. “We just have to get through today and it will all be over.” She released Agatha, pulling her away so she could cradle her face in her hands. “And I’ll be right there with you.” She drew her thumb across her cheek wiping away a few stray tears. “You’ve got this!” Agatha cracked a smile as she nodded, wiping away the last of the tears. “Turn around, let me help you with the dress.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha turned slowly, pulling her fallen locs to the side to give Rio better access. She felt her warm hands brace her shoulders and the back of her neck tickled as she felt Rio’s lips kiss along her hairline before she tugged the zipper closed. Rio’s hands then returned to her shoulders as she invited her to turn back around. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“There’s one problem solved and you look absolutely stunning!” Agatha blushed at the compliment as she rolled her eyes in disbelief. “Now I will admit, I have no talent when it comes to hair so I’m not even going to attempt to put it up for you, but I will say it drives me absolutely wild in its natural state.” She reached up, unpinning the few strands Agatha had managed to conquer. “Fuck that’s hot! Your mother will be lucky if I don’t take you right there in the courtroom!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio!” Agatha chided, though her bashful smirk betrayed her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“As for the shoes, why don’t you take a seat and have some breakfast and I’ll look for the missing one.” She nodded over to the counter where Agatha’s earlier order was waiting for her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What did I ever do to deserve you?” Agatha sighed as she headed for her seat, mouth practically drooling at the sight.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You put up with this clingy dork!” Rio chuckled as she kissed Agatha’s cheek on her way to search the bedroom. “Eat! We have to leave in like 10 minutes!” Rio warned as she disappeared through the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha quickly devoured the meal and before long Rio reemerged with the missing shoe. “Where did you find it?” She gasped as she took her empty plate to the sink. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It was hiding!” Rio smirked, scrunching her nose. “I had looked through everything and couldn’t find it, then I decided to think like a shoe.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Think like a shoe?” Agatha snorted, her eyebrows raised in astonished amusement.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I got down on the floor, you know, shoe height, crawled around to some of the obvious corners and then I spotted it right under the bed.” She tossed the shoe to Agatha. “Hate to say you never would have found it.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Only you would know to think like a shoe and actually find it!” Agatha laughed as she dropped the shoe to the floor and wedged her foot into it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You ready?” Rio asked as she grabbed the keys</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“As I’ll ever be.” Agatha groaned as she headed for the door. Rio caught her along the way, taking her hand in hers as she moved to open the door for them both. As it swung wide Agatha’s face began to contort in anger as yet another “gift” had miraculously appeared overnight, blocking their exit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I swear I’m going to kill her!” Agatha grunted through gritted teeth. Rio peered around the door to find an ornate wooden cradle placed against the threshold with a sign tented in the center that read, </span>
<em>
<span>See you later, dear</span>
</em>
<span>, scrawled in scripted writing. “This is the last straw!” She roared as she tried to push it away unsuccessfully to which Rio waved her out of the way.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Damn this thing is heavy as fuck!” Rio groaned as she lifted it just enough for them to pass. “What the hell is it even made of, lead?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s kingwood.” Agatha corrected as she stared, disgusted at the sight.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How do you know that?” Rio turned to her in shock</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Because I sold it at the estate sale. It had been in the family for generations.” Agatha explained flippantly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re kidding! She tracked it down and dumped it at your doorstep?!” Rio exclaimed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“More than likely she paid someone to buy it for her. She’s surprisingly sentimental, though not about me.” Agatha replied as she brushed past the object. “Come on, we can deal with it when we get back.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The drive to the courthouse was silent as they each pondered the day ahead. Agatha sat, arms crossed above her stomach, stewing over her mother’s latest stunt. Rio drove with both hands gripping the wheel, eyes narrowed on the road as she contemplated the many ways she would enjoy watching Evanora suffer. As Rio rounded the corner to the courthouse she pulled up in front of the monumental staircase, unlocking the doors and moved to open her door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What are you doing?” Agatha spat in a panic, grabbing Rio by the arm. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I thought I’d let you out here so you don’t have to walk as far.” Rio explained</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No! No way, I am not going in there without you.” Agatha’s voice trembled with trepidation. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, ok, no problem. I’ll try and find a spot nearby.” She settled back into her seat and pulled away from the curb. They cycled the block until they found a parking garage and descended 3 floors before they found a spot. As Rio turned off the car she glanced over at Agatha who was busy gnawing at the corner of her lip as she stared off into nothing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Rio cooed as she gathered Agatha’s hand in hers. “It’s going to be ok, we’re going to get through this.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha let a smile creep into the corner of her lips as she broke her stare to catch Rio’s reassuring gaze. “Of course we will, together.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio beamed as Agatha kissed the edge of her knuckles. “Come on, let’s get this over with.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed as she moved to exit the vehicle. Rio hurried out of the car to catch her at the back so they could walk hand in hand to the elevator. They waited for a brief moment before the doors opened and they stepped inside. They pressed the button for the street and just as the doors were about to close a hand shot through the opening and forced them back open. Agatha recoiled in disgust, stepping to the back of the elevator as her mother’s lawyer, Christian, stepped inside. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ah! Agatha! I thought that was you. Long time no see.” He said cheerily with a smarmy grin as the doors closed behind him. His oversized grey suit hung loosely on his portly frame though the shirt he had chosen looked ready to bust at the buttons. Agatha said nothing as she glared at him and gripped Rio’s hand tighter. “Well alrighty then.” He rolled his eyes before narrowing in on Rio. “And who might you be?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised an eyebrow to Agatha as she replied confidently, “Dr. Rio Vidal, Agatha’s girlfriend.” She shot her hand forward to shake his, eyeing him directly as she squeezed his hand aggressively enough to cause him to wince. “And you are?” She posed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Christian Atwood, opposing counsel.” He replied, shaking his hand loose from her grip. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ah! I see. Are you the same Christian who accosted my girlfriend on her porch not too long ago?” She asked, shifting herself to stand slightly in front of Agatha as her hands dipped into her pockets. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Accosted?” He scoffed, “I think between the two of us she was the aggressor. You’re lucky I didn’t press charges!” He added pointing at Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t think luck had anything to do with it.” Rio shrugged. “Would have been an impossible case to win, given she was acting in self defense.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, yeah.” He waived his hand dismissively. “I’ve made a full recovery by the way, if you were wondering.” He spat back at Agatha over Rio’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I wasn’t” Agatha finally grumbled to him.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, she speaks!?” He chuckled mirthlessly, “I hear congratulations are in order,” he said as he eyed her round figure, “though can you really be happy about being an unwed, single mother?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Man! You really want to lose that other ball don’t you?” Rio growled as she cracked her knuckles.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio…” Agatha cautioned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“All I’m saying is you’re setting that kid up for failure from the start. Fatherless and a psycho for a mother. It’ll be a miracle if it doesn’t off itself the moment it realizes the fucked up life you’re forcing it to live.” Christian snorted with laughter sending Rio over the edge.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha caught her just as she was launching at him which caused him to stumble back through the now open elevator doors and fall flat on his ass. After a moment of shocked silence they both broke into a fit of laughter as he struggled to right himself, face red as a beet with embarrassment, and scurry off down the street. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Gods, I love instant karma!” Agatha cried as they stepped out of the elevator and started down the street. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Right?! That guy was more of an asshole than I could have imagined. He’s lucky you were there to stop me, I was ready to beat him to a pulp for talking to you like that! Fuck, I still might.” Rio bounced as she walked, attempting to shake off the adrenaline.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio, you promised you wouldn’t.” Agatha warned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know, I know, but damn that shit made my blood boil!” Rio admitted as she tried to refocus herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“This is only the beginning. We’re in for this shit all day and the best thing you can do is ignore it and not respond. That’s all these people want is for us to react and give them a justification for playing the victim. You can’t let them get to you.” Agatha reminded her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ugh, you’re right, I’ll try and reel it in. But best believe if anyone starts anything I </span>
<em>
<span>will </span>
</em>
<span>be the one to finish it.” Rio confirmed, matter-of-factly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“By walking away right?” Agatha insisted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, dear, by walking away.” Rio rolled her eyes as she reluctantly agreed. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As they ascended the marble stairs and pushed through the ornate wooden doors of the courthouse, joining the line for the security checkpoint, Agatha’s gaze darted around the hall, her heart raced as she kept an eye out for Evanora. She knew, of course, they would cross paths sooner rather than later yet she didn’t want to be caught off guard by her presence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Any sign of her?” Rio asked, removing her belt and wallet to pass through the metal detector. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not yet, but it’s only a matter of time.” Agatha huffed as she waited for Rio to be further inspected by security.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha! There you are!” They each turned abruptly to see Valentina walking towards them. “Glad to see you made it in alright. Any trouble with parking?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, not at all. But we did have the unfortunate displeasure of running into my mothers lawyer on the way in.” Agatha groaned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That dude was way out of fucking line!” Rio bit, still on edge from the earlier confrontation. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh I am all too aware! I’ve run into him in one other case of mine, a civil dispute, and he made the process as long and difficult as he possibly could. It got pretty nasty but we won out in the end.” Agatha and Rio exchanged an anxious look. “Not to worry, we’ve been blessed with Judge Horowitz today and she has zero tolerance for his kind of bullshit.” Agatha sighed a breath of relief at that. “Well, shall we?” Val asked as she beckoned them towards the elevator. Agatha reached for Rio’s hand, hoping her grounding presence would help to reassure the waves of anxiety that were swelling within her as each step drew them nearer to her mother. As the doors closed behind them she could feel a lump beginning to form in her throat as her son danced circles just beneath her skin.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you have any fun plans for this weekend?” Val asked, as if today was just another day and not the panic inducing nightmare she had been dreading for weeks. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Luckily Rio wasn’t as burdened by this travesty and was happy to lead the conversation for them both. “We’re supposed to have lunch with my aunt on Sunday and we might try and go shopping for some things for the baby.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh that should be fun! Do you know what you’re having?” Val asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It’s a boy. She’s due at the beginning of June and we’re a little behind on preparation so it may be more of a shopping spree.” Rio explained. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I remember with my oldest I tried to buy everything I thought I might possibly need and ended up not using half of it. As long as you have the basics to start, clothes, diapers, a place for him to sleep, you’ll figure out the rest as you go!” She gave them a reassuring smile as she led them out of the elevator and down the hallway. “We’re in room 333 and have about 15 minutes before we have to head in. If you need a snack or something to drink there are a few vending machines at the end of that hallway to the right.” Val indicated as they hurried down the corridor. “We’re coming up on our room, if either of you need to use the restroom just continue on and it’s down at the end.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As they reached the alcove that led to their room Agatha searched but saw no sign of her mother. All she could see was her mother’s lawyer pacing back and forth impatiently, sending a wave of nauseating disgust throughout her body. “I…I think I’m going to head to the restroom.” She announced as she continued down the hall. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you want me to go with you?” Rio offered, seeing the unease in her face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No…no, I’ll be alright. I’ll be back in a minute.” She continued down the hallway, darting a furious glare at Christian as she passed him along the way. She had warned Rio to contain herself but seeing him again brought a fresh wave of fury to the surface. If she could have squashed his pigheaded face with her mind she would have done so in that very moment. She needed a few minutes alone to refocus herself and cool down before this impending shitstorm began. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She pushed through the restroom doors and darted straight for the sink, hoping the cool water would help relieve the furious tension. As she padded her chest and neck she heard one of the stall doors swing open. She glanced up into the mirror and her heart dropped in horror. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, well, well! There she is! Mother of miraculous conception!” echoed the sinister voice of Evanora against the tiled bathroom walls as she sidled up next to Agatha at the sinks. “My, aren’t we looking fruitful!” Agatha swallowed hard, gaze pointed downward as she clenched her teeth in an effort to contain the rage that was threatening to lash out at the woman standing far too close for comfort. “When I had heard the news I expected this had been a more recent development but you, my dear, look practically ready to bust!” Evanora cackled. Agatha turned away to dry her hands and immediately headed into a stall slamming the door behind her. “Oh! Seems I may have struck a nerve! You’ll need to learn to control that temper of yours before my grandchild arrives. You don’t have the luxury of resorting to tantrums and obscene behaviour like I know you are inclined to.” Agatha remained silent as she sat, refusing to engage in the obvious inflammatory sentiments her mother was spewing, though the words cut deep. “Not speaking are we? Shocking! Very well then, I’ll leave you with this; </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> may be comfortable living a life of self-serving indulgence and sexual sin but I refuse to allow </span>
<em>
<span>my </span>
</em>
<span>grandchild to be corrupted by your moral impropriety. Enjoy motherhood, dear…while you still can. I’ll see you in court.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She held her breath as she heard her mother’s footsteps retreat and the door swing closed behind her. Her heartbeat rushed furiously throughout her body, pounding in her ears as a tingling numbness began to prickle at the tips of her limbs, creeping quickly as her mind began to swirl in a heady dread. She blinked listlessly at the floor in front of her as her breath drew quick and shallow. Evanora’s words hung forebodingly in her mind. </span>
<em>
<span>Enjoy motherhood while you still can? What did she mean by that? </span>
</em>
<span>It was clearly a threat but </span>
<em>
<span>what was she threatening? </span>
</em>
<span>She braced her arms against her pregnant belly, allowing the swimming hum of her son to soothe her anxieties as best they could. He was there, he was alive, he was safe tucked within her…for the time being. There was nothing her mother could do to change that…</span>
<em>
<span>could she?</span>
</em>
<span> As her mind continued to buzz she heard the door swing open vigorously and the panicked shuffling of feet soon after.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha! Are you still in here?” Rio’s voice shouted as she searched the room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha slowly pressed the stall door open and stepped out. “Rio…” she called out with a wavering quiver in her voice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio turned and rushed to gather her in her arms. “Are you ok? I saw her walk out of here with a smug look on her face and was so worried for you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I…I think so...it’s just…she…she said something…” Agatha started, trying to clear her thoughts. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What did she say to you?” Rio pressed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I think…I don’t know. It didn’t make much sense.” Agatha frowned as she struggled to recall the exact words. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What did she say!?” Rio commanded, drawing Agatha’s eyes to hers in urgency. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She told me to enjoy motherhood…while I still can.” Agatha mumbled, still trying to make sense of those words. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes blazed with fury “What the fuck is that supposed to mean?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s what I’m trying to figure out. It made no sense!” Agatha shook her head frustratedly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It sounds like she was trying to intimidate you, throw you off before we see the judge.” Rio offered as she tumbled the idea over in her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You're probably right. It…It just makes me nervous, like she might be up to something.” Agatha bit her lip anxiously. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Something other than suing you for the house?” Rio scrunched her face in confusion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t know, it was just so odd, even for her, which is saying something.”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Just then Val pushed through into the room. “Everything alright in here? It’s time to head in.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sucked a breath in, readying herself for further mind games. “Yeah…yeah, right of course. We… we should go.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you sure you’re ok?” Rio asked, stopping her as she turned away.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I’ll be fine once this is all put to rest.” Agatha insisted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes darted between Agatha’s ocean blue orbs, worried but determined. “Alright, Agatha. I’m right behind you.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As they stepped into the courtroom Agatha could feel all eyes turn on them. There were a smattering of people in the pews, none of whom she recognized save for the row of seven women who sat directly behind Evanora, all clad in black as if they were crows hovering on a telephone line. Each of their eyes bore judgement and fury as she and Rio made their way to the desk at the front. Her mother’s lawyer was bumbling about, shuffling along papers as he tried to sort himself out. A grey dusty stain still present on the seat of his pants from his earlier fall. Her mother sat stoic and unyielding, her modest grey dress pressed to perfection, hair pulled tightly into a bun, and her eyes fixed on the judges bench before them, as if Agatha’s appearance were merely happenstance and beneath her acknowledgement. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Just as they were settling in, the bailiff called them all to attention, “All rise for the honorable Judge Horowitz.” They each stood as an older woman, who couldn’t have been more than five feet tall, shuffled into the room. Her short, curly auburn hair a cloud around her face. She wore large black spectacles which made her eyes the size of golf balls and she practically disappeared in the black judges cloak she was wearing.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thank you, you may be seated.” She mumbled into the microphone. There was a moment of silence as she re-read over the case before her before speaking again. “Alright, I see we have here Harkness v Harkness. That’s going to make things quite confusing. Who is representing the plaintiff?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That would be me, your honor.” Christian replied, standing to address the judge.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hmm, I see.” She mumbled, seemingly annoyed as she scribbled something down. “That must mean you are representing the defendant, Ms. Fontaine?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That is correct, your honor.” Val replied</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And you are bringing a counter claim as well?” The judge confirmed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Indeed your honor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well let’s sort this matter first and then we can get to your counter suit.” She offered as she adjusted the papers in front of her. “I see this is an issue of inheritance and you are disputing the contents of the will?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“More or less, your honor” Christian started as he began to gather his papers. “It appears that the will that was executed in this case was invalid as there had been another agreement made after the fact.” Christian explained. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I see, and do you have the document you’re referring to?” Judge Horowitz asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, your honor. May I approach the bench?” Christian grabbed the paper and began to head towards her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No you may not!” Spat the judge, stopping him in his tracks. “My bailiff will collect the document from you.” Judge Horowitz replied sharply as she motioned for the bailiff to retrieve the item from him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alrighty then.” Christian huffed under his breath as he made his way back to his chair.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What was that Mr. Atwood?” The judge snapped</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, um, as you wish, your honor!” he corrected bashfully</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s what I thought!” she replied as the bailiff handed her the document. She quickly reviewed it and brought her attention back to Christian. “Do you have a copy of the will you are contesting?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Christian rifled through the mess of papers in front of him before pulling out a particularly crumpled one. “Yes! Right here, your honor.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I can see you’ve prepared diligently for court today Mr. Atwood.” She grumbled as she motioned for the bailiff, “Karl, if you would.” She reread the document in hand as she waited for the bailiff to return. Once he handed her the copy of the will her face scrunched in revulsion. “Where have you been keeping this? On the floor of your car? It’s hardly legible in this current state!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If I may, your honor!” Val piped up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ms. Fontaine?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I happen to have a copy that might better suit your needs.” She held the forms aloft for the bailiff to take. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Indeed, Karl” she waved for him to collect the papers. As soon as he returned she handed back Christian’s documents. “Be sure this finds the trash.” She grumbled as she looked over the will. They waited in silence as she reviewed them slowly, her enormous glasses slipping down her nose as she read. She moved back and forth between the documents a few times before speaking again. “I already have several questions about what has been presented but I would like to hear from the defendant before we get into that. Ms. Fontaine…” She called to which Valentina rose. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is your client currently in possession of the property?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, your honor.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What about the contents within, mentioned in each of the documents?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She had taken it upon herself to sell the contents of the home, given the understanding it was her property, according to the plaintiff’s own lawyer.” Val explained with a side eye to Christian. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I see, and how much did she make from the sale of those items?” Val looked down to Agatha who scribbled a figure onto the available notepad.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Approximately $250,000.00, your honor. Though we can get a more accurate figure from the estate sale company, should you wish.” As soon as the number was read aloud Agatha could feel her mother’s eyes boring into her, no doubt infuriated that she had earned such a sum for many of the priceless antiques her family had collected over the years. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m fine to accept that for the time being, we’ll dig into it further if I deem necessary.” She scribbled her own notes before continuing. “Mr. Atwood!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Christian shot up from his seat, nearly knocking the chair over. “Yes, your honor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Time for my questions! It appears, you yourself were the one to execute the will you are contesting. Where was this document at that time?” she asked, holding up the new will. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It…it had been misplaced, your honor.” He explained bashfully. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is that a common practice in your law firm, Mr. Atwood?” Judge Horowitz asked, peering over her glasses.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, not at all your honor. There were…extenuating circumstances.” He babbled nervously. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Enlighten me.” The judge replied, unamused. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“At the time Mr. Harkness was on bedrest. Therefore this document was agreed to at the family home mentioned in the will and filed away there by his assistant per the request of the now deceased. At the time of his death I was unable to uncover the whereabouts of this will and my firm was required to comply with what </span>
<em>
<span>was </span>
</em>
<span>on file. My client had some theories as to where it may have been placed but, being restricted from the property, she was unable to assist in locating it”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I see. And why was your client restricted from the property?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“There was a </span>
<em>
<span>minor </span>
</em>
<span>familial dispute between Mr. Harkness and my client a few years back and she was henceforth restricted from entering the property as long as it was considered a part of his estate.” Christian explained</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is there a record of this dispute?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I do have a copy of the no-trespassing order, your honor, if you would like to see.” He shuffled through some more papers before pulling out a file.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, as long as it’s still legible.” She motioned, once again, for the bailiff to collect the document. She quickly reviewed it and turned her attention back to Christian. “I see, yet, despite this dispute, in the end he decided to award her the property and assets?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, your honor.” Christian insisted</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So who eventually uncovered the document?” The judge asked with a frown</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“My client, your honor.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And how exactly did she gain access to the property?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Access was eventually granted.” Christian claimed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Granted by whom?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The defendant.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned over and whispered to Val, “I did not grant access, she just showed up at the estate sale. I didn’t even know she had been banned.” Val nodded in acknowledgment as she scribbled the note down. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do you have anything else you would like to share with me Mr. Atwood?” The judge asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not at this time your honor.” Christian said as he returned to his seat.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Very well, Ms. Fontaine, you may plead your case.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thank you, your honor. I have two pieces of evidence I would like to submit. The first being the death certificate of Mr. Ebenezer Aloicous Harkness.The other is an affidavit signed by the hospice nurse caring for him during the last three months of his life outlining the various conditions he was suffering from.” The bailiff secured the documents and handed  them to the judge. “I would like to note that the date of the contesting will is merely a week before the passing of Mr. Harkness and, as you’ll see in the affidavit, amongst his many ailments, Mr. Harkness was suffering from dementia which would render him incapable of being of sound mind or body at the time of signing.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Judge Horowitz scowled as she reviewed everything carefully. “Well, Mr. Atwood… anything to say for yourself?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span> Christian cleared his throat as he stood. “He was lucid at the time of signing your honor.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The 95 year old dementia patient was lucid at the time of signing?” The judge stared him down above the rim of her heavy glasses. “I find that hard to believe, Mr. Atwood.” Judge Horowitz said as she began stacking the papers before her. “Given the evidence presented by the defendant I am dismissing this suit. Mr. Atwood, I would get your ducks in a row as you should plan to expect a thorough review from the state board in your near future. We will take a brief 30 minute recess and return to settle the counterclaim. You are dismissed.” With a bang of the gavel the judge stood and began to exit.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“All rise!” Shouted the bailiff as the judge made her way back to her chambers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That worked out well!” Sighed Rio as she plopped back into the chair. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Right? I knew that man was an incompetent buffoon but he really outdid himself here!” Val chuckled</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah…” Agatha whispered in reply though her attention lingered on her mother and the coven of women gathered around her engaged in casual conversation as if they were at brunch, not in court trying to rip her life apart. Evanora seemed relatively unphased, disappointed clearly, but she held none of the rage Agatha had expected at losing the suit. Her calmness stoked the fear she had sparked in Agatha earlier in the bathroom, sending a panicked chill down her spine. “Something’s off” she murmured.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What was that, cariño?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She’s not nearly as furious as I would have expected her to be after losing.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She probably knew they had no case!” Rio shrugged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Then why did she even bother?” Agatha grunted in frustration. She stared for another moment as they conversed conspiratorially, taking in the prattle amongst them. Her eyes and ears searching for the conversation just out of reach. She caught a word here, a sentence there, but nothing she could entirely piece together. Still, she couldn’t shake the feeling like they were plotting something, undeterred by their loss. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, just as she was about to return to her seat her mother caught her gaze, eyes glinting with smug, self-satisfaction and something darker, something ominous and alarming. A viscous grin crept along her face causing Agatha’s heart to stutter in her chest, her stomach to lurch and her knees to nearly give out beneath her. “I…I need some air.” She gasped as she stumbled out from behind the desk and hurried down the aisle through the wooden doors. She rushed down the hallway, unsure of where she was headed, only knowing she had to get as far away from Evanora as she could. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Agatha! Agatha, wait!” Rio called after her as she chased her down the corridor. She caught up with her just as she rounded the corner and found Agatha, back pressed against the wall, her breath coming in shattered bursts as her face froze in panic. “Mi amor! What’s the matter? What’s wrong?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“She's up to something!” Agatha huffed as she began to pace “I…I just know it!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What do you mean?” Rio frowned in confusion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You should have seen the way she looked at me, it’s the kind of looks she has when she’s plotting my demise. I just…I know this isn’t the end of it.” Agatha huffed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How so? She lost, now we’re going to get to banish her from our lives for good. What else could she possibly do?” Rio chuckled nervously</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I DON'T KNOW!” Agatha shouted, still pacing “Ugh, I feel like I’m going to be sick.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Here, my love, have a seat, catch your breath. You need to calm down.” Rio encouraged as she began to guide Agatha to a nearby bench. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t tell me to calm down!” Agatha shouted, pushing Rio off of her. “You have no idea the kind of shit she’s pulled! She will do anything to tear my life apart. She tried to get me kicked out of college multiple times, I was suspended twice. She tried to drive Wanda away when she found out about us and it nearly worked. I was fired from my first two jobs because of her. She hates to see me happy and she’s relentless!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry, I wasn’t trying to dismiss your feelings, I just…I was trying to help. It’s…it’s not good for your health, all this stress.” Rio’s eyes gleamed with care and worry. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know! That’s what terrifies me. All the shit she’s been pulling lately, sending those horrendous gifts, what she said in the bathroom, this fucking lawsuit and whatever else she has up her sleeve…I just…I don’t know how much more of this I can take!” Agatha began to crumble as she collapsed into Rio’s arms. “I’m just so ready for this day to be over! I just want to crawl into bed with you and forget any of this happened.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Soon, mi amor, I promise!” Rio held Agatha close as she kissed her forehead. “You know what might help?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I swear if the word meditate comes out of your mouth I’ll throttle you!” Agatha hissed over Rio’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Cariño! Save that energy for the bedroom!” Rio snorted in laughter. “No, I was going to say a snack, though some deep breathing wouldn’t be bad either.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What kind of snack?” Agatha whimpered</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged, “I bet I can find some cookies in the vending machine!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oooo, I would kill for an Oreo right now.” Agatha gushed as she righted herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Then Oreos you shall have! Do you want to head back in with Val or wait here for me?” Rio asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m not ready to go back in there. I want to spend as little time in my mother’s presence as possible!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Completely understandable! This spot’s kind of tucked away, why don’t you have a seat, do try and take some deep breaths, relax as best you can, and I’ll be back before you know it!” She gave Agatha a quick peck on the cheek then rushed off down the hallway. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As soon as Rio disappeared around the corner Agatha sunk into the bench against the wall with a groan. The weight of everything, the aches and pains of pregnancy, having to be here in court, having to deal with her Mother, it was crushing her. She could feel her heart pounding throughout her body as her son rolled and pressed against her causing her to twinge in discomfort. She took a deep calming breath as she guided her hands along the surface. “I know, I know little bug! I got you all worked up. Let’s take a minute together, like Rio suggested, and try to calm down.” She closed her eyes and leaned her head back against the wall as she breathed in through her nose. “She can’t hurt us...not anymore.” she sighed just as much to herself as to her son. As she sat there, silently breathing, settling her nerves and waiting for Rio to return, her ears picked up on chattering whispers from a couple familiar voices just around the corner.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I still can’t believe she tracked down that nurse!” Said the first woman, who Agatha recognized as Florence, one of her mother’s close congregants.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know, I was sure this was going to go in her favor! Clearly the Lord works in mysterious ways.” Replied Bernice, another congregant. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Indeed he does! Though, I don’t know that she cares much at this point so long as the visitation goes through.” Florence explained</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So she did end up filing?” Bernice asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I think Christian is drafting the paperwork while we’re waiting to continue. She’s much further along than we thought.” Florence exclaimed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I know! When I found out I prayed, hoping the Lord would spare this child like her last one, but it appears it may be doomed to suffer her obscene parentage.” Bernice growled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Not if Evanora can help it! She was going to file for full custody but was advised against it considering the slim margin for success. But, given Agatha is unmarried, there seems to be a chance they would grant her some sort of visitation. It is her grandchild after all!” Florence reasoned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Too true! Then again, there is always the chance she doesn’t survive the birth. Evanora would undoubtedly be granted custody then. We both know that child has no father and that horrid woman she’s cavorting with would have no claim.” Bernice replied.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“From your lips to God’s ears. We can only pray that He sees fit to make it come to pass.” Florence said as their voices drifted further. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sat, silently as she could, shaking with fear and rage at the conversation being had as the women continued down the hallway. So this was her plan. This is why she had flashed that shit-eating grin in Agatha’s direction even after she had lost the suit. This is what she had meant when she had told her to </span>
<em>
<span>enjoy motherhood </span>
</em>
<span>while she still can. She was coming after her child! Of all the things she had done to her this was the most diabolical, but how could she stop it?!</span>
</p><p>
<span>She could hear her heart racing as the color drained from her face and a cold sweat gathered on her brow. She felt saliva filling her mouth as her stomach lurched and turned threatening to spill its contents. Her eyes searched for a receptacle as the nausea continued to build. With nothing in sight she hurried as best she could to her feet and stumbled out into the hallway, at last finding a trash can a few feet away. She rushed forward and ripped off the metal lid just in time for the contents of her stomach to make their appearance. As the final heaves convulsed throughout her body Rio returned to the alcove. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“They didn’t have any Oreos in the machine up here but I went down a floor and found…Agatha?” She stepped back from the entrance and searched for her, quickly finding her doubled over the trash can. “Agatha!” She shouted as she rushed to her side, dropping the cookies as she gathered her sweat drenched hair away from her face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha rested her face on her arm as she caught her breath, urging her body to relax as she felt Rio’s hand rubbing soothing circles on her back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio…” she cried as she lifted her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m right here, Cariño.” She cooed as Agatha righted herself, face streaming with tears. “Oh! Mi vida! Are you ok?” Agatha shook her head as she stumbled back from the trash can and reached to steady herself on the bannister overlooking the entryway. “Do you feel like you’re going to be sick again?” Agatha shook her head again as she worked to calm her breathing. “Maybe you should sit back down.” Rio suggested, bracing Agatha’s back as she took her hand to lead her back over to the bench. As she sat Rio kneeled in front of her, her hands brushing away the tear soaked curls clinging to her face. “If you’re comfortable here I’m going to go get a towel from the bathroom and grab your bag, we need to check your blood pressure, you do not look good!” She pressed her lips to Agatha’s forehead as she rose and turned to leave but was stopped by Agatha whose hand clung to her wrist. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“NO! Please…don’t go!” She begged, her gaze awash with fear and panic. “She’s…coming for him! I…I heard them!” She gasped through hiccups that had taken the place of her sobs. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What are you talking about?” Rio turned back in confusion</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“My mother…she’s filing for visitation.” Rio’s eyes flashed with a fury that startled Agatha as her ears and cheeks began to grow flush with rage.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Over my dead body!” She growled as she stepped back to pull Agatha protectively against her. “I swear that woman is begging to be carried out on a stretcher!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio, please!” Agatha scolded as she clung to her. “We have to do something! She…she can’t have him!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We will, my love, we’ll figure this out!” Rio assured as she ran her fingers through Agatha’s hair. “Do you have your phone on you?” Agatha nodded silently as she released Rio from her grip and wiped away a fresh tear. “We need to talk to Val, now!” Rio urged. Agatha reached into her dress pocket, pulled out her phone and immediately dialed Val. “Here, cariño, let me talk to her.” Rio motioned for Agatha to hand her the phone. “You relax as best you can.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio brought the phone to her ear and began pacing as Agatha rested her head against the wall and braced her arms securely around the swollen mound in her lap, currently vibrating with the swimming motions of her son. She moved a hand over a ripple as she closed her eyes, soaking in the feeling of him tucked inside her, safe and close. She had been wary of his birth before, the pain, the risks, but now, with this added threat, she was utterly terrified. </span>
<em>
<span>How would she protect him once he was born? How could she ever ensure his safety in a world that was so cruel? Then of course, if worse came to worst and something happened to her…?</span>
</em>
<span> She shuddered at the thought. There were so many things she hadn’t considered before now and it was deepening the pit of fear inside her, threatening to swallow her whole.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Hey, where are you guys? We’re going to get started again in about 10 minutes!</span>
</em>
<span>” Val asked as she answered the call.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hey it’s Rio! We’re out in the hallway around the corner. Is there any way we could get more time? We need to talk with you, now, somewhere private.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>I can ask the bailiff. Is everything alright?</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, not really. There’s been…a development.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Oh! Ok. I can probably get us another 30 minutes.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That should be fine. Where can we meet you?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Are you down near the elevators?</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, not too far.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Room 303 is nearby, it’s a conference room and should be free. I’ll meet you there shortly.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Amazing! Thank you! Would you mind bringing Agatha’s bag with you?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>The black one?</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah that’s it. And maybe a bottle of water?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>You got it!</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’re the best. We’ll see you in a minute.” She hung up the phone and turned to Agatha. “You ok to get up and walk?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I’ll be fine as long as we’re not going far.” Agatha replied, still looking a bit pale. Rio stuck her head out from the alcove and peered around the corner, spotting the room nearby.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We’re just going around this corner so take your time.” Rio reassured as she moved to sit next to Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha breathed slowly, gathering her energy to move as her thoughts continued to spiral around this new threat. “Why?” she whispered as her chest heaved. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why what, mi amor?” Rio asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why does she have to be this way?” She opened her eyes and turned to look at Rio. “Why does she hate me?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m so sorry, cariño.” Rio brought a hand up to cradle Agatha’s face, pulling it close to allow their foreheads to rest against each other. “You don’t deserve this, any of it.” She wrapped her arms around Agatha, holding her close in a comforting embrace.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I love you.” Agatha hummed as she prepared herself to stand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I love you too, mi vida!” Rio placed a kiss on her cheek as she moved to help Agatha. “You ready?” she asked, offering her hand. Agatha nodded as she placed her hand in Rio’s, allowing her to help her to her feet before she led them to the room. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As they stepped into the fluorescently lit room Val was already seated and waiting. She jumped up from her chair as soon as she spotted them, seeing the state Agatha was recovering from. “Oh my gosh!” she gasped as she pulled out a chair for Agatha to quickly collapse into. “Are you ok?” she asked as she went to grab the bottle of water she had brought with her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’ll be fine.” Agatha brushed her off</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You sure? You look like you’ve seen a ghost! Should I call a medic?” Val asked, turning to Rio.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We’ll see, I do need to check her blood pressure.” Rio b-lined for Agatha’s purse to dig out the cuff. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What happened?” Val asked, looking confusedly between the two of them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“My mother!” Agatha groaned as Rio slipped the device onto her forearm. “She’s planning to file for visitation with my son.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“WHAT?!” Val shouted, shocked and even more confused than before.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s what I overheard at least.” Agatha huffed breathlessly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That doesn’t make any sense!” Val chuckled in disbelief.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is that even possible? Can she do that?” Rio asked as she started the reading.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t know! I’d have to dig into what exactly they’re filing.” Val explained</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The fact that she’s even trying is what scares me! Well that and…” Agatha started. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And what?” Rio asked, frowning in concern.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“They had also mentioned that, if anything were to happen to me, she would try and take custody of him.” Agatha revealed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Absolutely not!” Rio shouted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Who’s they?” Val asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I heard a couple of her friends talking in the hallway when Rio went to find cookies.” Agatha explained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“They were so fucking lucky I wasn’t there with you!” Rio mumbled as she removed the cuff.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What was it?” Agatha asked, seeing Rio’s concerned look.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t worry about it right now.” Rio replied, attempting to brush her off.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio…” she urged</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Higher than it should be but…”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio!” she demanded</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“145/90” Rio replied starkly. “I’m not calling emergency services yet but you need to take a minute and actually calm down. We’ll check it again later. I’m sure it’s just the stress of the situation.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No shit!” Agatha scoffed, as her body rang numb in shock. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Drink some more water, take some deep breaths.” Rio instructed, “Well, what can we do?” Rio asked, turning to Val.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“For right now, the best thing to do is stay our course. I’m feeling quite confident in our countersuit after our earlier hearing. If it goes the way I think it will I can easily get whatever else she’s planning to file thrown out immediately in conjunction with the ruling. So, try not to worry as best you can.” Val looked on encouragingly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They each sighed a breath of relief but a question still pricked at the back of Agatha’s mind. “That does make me feel a bit better…but then again…if something were to happen to me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Nothing’s going to happen to you, my love.” Rio rested her hands on Agatha’s shoulders and kissed the crown of her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha closed her eyes and gritted her teeth “But if something were, even if it were far in the future, how can I ensure she never claims him?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The best thing to do would be to write up a living will. Have it clearly laid out what the chain of custody would be in a worst case scenario.” Val suggested.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is that something you could help us with?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Certainly! With regards to that I do have a few questions, which may seem personal but it’s important to know as it can impact what’s even possible.” Val explained</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Of course.” Agatha whispered, voice weak and shaky with fear.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I take it you intend for Rio to assume custody in the unlikely case of your passing?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I…well…we hadn’t really…” Agatha stuttered as she fidgeted nervously</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Of course!” Rio answered assuredly. “I mean, if that’s what you want.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you sure?” Agatha asked, tilting her head to face Rio. “I don’t want you to feel obligated.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I promise, I don’t. I love him so much already, and if something were to ever happen to you, I just… I’d be a wreck! But…I couldn’t imagine him not being a part of my life.” Agatha gave Rio a teary smile as she reached for her hand on her shoulder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So yes then, I would want Rio listed as the legal guardian.” Agatha replied.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright, well that’s certainly possible but there are just a few other things we need to be aware of. I don’t want to assume but was this child donor conceived or what kind of relationship do you have with the other biological parent?” Val asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I guess it would be considered a known donor situation, though I don’t know that he would seek custody. He’s not really the parenting type.” Agatha explained</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Has he signed over parental rights?” Val questioned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, not directly.” Agatha muttered</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Then, currently, he would be entitled to custody over Rio or your mother. However, if you believe he would not be willing or able to take custody then it would fall back to your intentions outlined for the child in your will. Nine times out of ten the court will align with what is in the will as long as it’s in the best interest of the child.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“He’s somewhere cruising in the south of France at the moment, though I’m sure if I sent him the documents he’d be able to fill them out and send them back.” Agatha explained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s perfectly fine! I can get you the documents to send him by the end of the week and have something fleshed out by end of next. I wouldn’t stress too much but it would be good to have things solidified before the baby arrives so the sooner you can get him to sign the better since you are getting close. Also, just to make sure we cover all the bases, I would suggest adding an additional chain of custody, in the unlikely off chance that something happened to Rio as well, as in…if the both of you were to…simultaneously perish, so to speak.” Val offered delicately.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced back at Rio before replying, “I would have to talk with them but my friend Jennifer and her partner would be my next preference as guardians.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Great, confirm with them, get me their info, and we could have all this buttoned up within the month.” Val assured.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That would be incredible! Really! She needs some peace of mind at this point and to focus on getting ready for the baby. All of this nonsense is getting in the way of that and, as you can see, it’s been really detrimental to her health.” Rio explained as she ran her fingers soothingly through Agatha’s hair. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Don’t worry, this is on my list of things to bring up in the countersuit. Not only impacting your health but the health of your child. Oh, I meant to ask, has she sent you any other gifts?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio and Agatha shared a knowing glance. “Practically one a day since we’ve seen you. A blanket with a cross stitched into it, too many stuffed animals to count, dozens of religious children’s books, it’s all been inconvenient to say the least.” Rio groaned</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The latest one was a family heirloom cradle she managed to track down from the estate sale that she shoved in front of my door this morning. That one at least came with a note.” Agatha snorted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“And these have all been delivered to your house?” Val confirmed</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“There’s something sitting out there nearly every morning.” Rio explained</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Did you happen to catch any footage?” Val asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, yeah I have it on my phone!” Rio whipped her phone out of her pocket. “It’s never her leaving it, but some of the faces I recognize in the courtroom.” She said as she scrolled through the app. “Oooo, today it looks like she hired actual movers to deliver at like 4 in the morning?” She turned the phone around to show Val and Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can you send me those, I’ll plan to include them as evidence of the harassment.” Val asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, absolutely!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, I recognize them, they’re brothers and deacons at her church.” Agatha pointed out as she watched the video.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“See! It’s all of them, it’s her whole cult. That’s the only thing that worries me, even if we do get this protection order in place she still has hoards of people that will harass Agatha on her behalf.” Rio grumbled, exasperatedly.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If it can be proven that they are contacting Agatha on her behalf that would constitute a violation of the order.” Val explained.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That sounds difficult to prove.” Agatha groaned skeptically</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“It may be easier than you think. If it can be shown they have no relationship with Agatha outside of Evanora and are continuing established behavior, such as leaving the gifts, it would give us grounds to exercise the consequences of the order. At the very least we would have it investigated.” Val shrugged.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That makes me feel a lot better! How about you, Carino?" Rio asked, turning to Agatha.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“As long as everything works out I’ll feel a lot better. Right now I’m just anxious for it to all be over. For her to be out of my life for good!” she sighed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m quite confident that after today, if she tries to contact you it’ll be a one way ticket to jail.” Val assured.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, wouldn’t that be nice!” Rio grinned as her eyes flashed with delight at the thought. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If neither of you have any further questions it would be a good idea to head back in, they’ll be planning to start soon.” Val rose and headed to the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I might need a minute to pull myself together. I’m sure I look like a disaster and I don’t want to give any of them the satisfaction.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do what you need to do and I’ll review the footage you sent me and meet you both in there shortly.” Val said as she exited into the hallway. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Can you hand me my bag?” Agatha asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Of course, my love.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thank you.” Agatha immediately began digging for gum and a makeup wipe. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Are you sure you’re alright to go back in there?” Rio questioned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Why wouldn’t I be?” Agatha dismissed non-chalantly </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, I don’t know, with everything that just happened. Your blood pressure skyrocketing. I’m worried about you, both of you!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m fine, really, and he’s currently swimming laps inside of me. That was a lot but we’re both ok, I promise.” She said, patting Rio’s cheek as she passed to inspect herself in a mirror. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You would tell me if you weren’t right?” Rio asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Uhuh.” Agatha hummed as she started to braid her hair. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Because I don’t know what I would do if anything happened to you.” Rio muttered as she glided to stand behind Agatha, resting her chin on her shoulder as her hands moved to wrap around her pregnant belly, feeling the motion within. Agatha leaned into the hold as she let her hands fall atop Rio’s. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You’d really take him? If anything did happen?” Agatha asked as she rested her head against Rio’s cheek, her gaze fixed on their intertwined fingers holding the tiny life inside her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“In a heartbeat! But let’s hope it never comes to that!” Rio placed a soft kiss on Agatha's cheek before stepping back and holding out her hand. “You ready to go banish this bitch for good?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked as she took Rio’s hand “Ugh, more than you know!” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As they re-entered the courtroom Agatha held her head high. All of her mothers antagonistic harassment was about to come to an end. Rio was locked in step with her, their hands held together in a magnetic pull as they sauntered down the aisle way back to their table. They looked confident, formidable, and ready to squash this annoyance once and for all. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha could feel her mother’s eyes on her, urging her to look and break once again, but she held fast, reassured by Rio’s grounding presence and the confidence she had in Val’s plan. All her bases were covered and she found an almost giddy joy growing inside her at the thought of her mothers demise. Her heart fluttered as the bailiff stepped out and asked them once again to rise as Judge Horowitz resumed her seat at the bench. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You may be seated. Ms. Fontain are you prepared to present your countersuit?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Indeed your honor.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The floor is yours, you may proceed” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thank you, your honor. Family disputes are never easy but my client and the defendant have a particularly tumultuous relationship. There is a long history of childhood abuse and trauma perpetrated by the defendant which caused my client to establish no contact when she was 18. I don’t want to waste any more of this court’s time digging that far back, for now we will simply cite the most recent events. The previous suit, for example, was one incident in a long series of incidents where the defendant has harassed and badgered my client. The elder Ms. Harkness and her lawyer sought my client out months ago and pestered her repeatedly urging her to sign an agreement to overtake the property, so she did in an effort to end their communication. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Once signed; however, they campaigned for her to visit the property without disclosing the reason they were so adamant. She was reluctant, given her own personal history with the family and the property as well as her availability, but harassment only increased to the point where </span>
<em>
<span>opposing counsel</span>
</em>
<span> accosted her on her own doorstep. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After that incident she made plans to visit the property and manage her inheritance in the way she saw fit. Part of which was to sell the contents of the home in the estate sale and eventually sell the property itself. The defendant took it upon herself to visit the property at the time of the estate sale, which we now know was only in an effort to recover the invalid will, where she too accosted my client and caused physical damage to her person before once again being banned from the premises. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Even after this incident there has been continued threatening contact from the defendant leading up to our court date today. This is but a small glimpse into the many reasons we are seeking a harassment and protection order from the elder Ms. Harkness for my client.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What evidence have you brought with you regarding these incidents and threats?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I have an incident report from the encounter at the property in Boston. There wasn’t a report made when Mr. Atwood attacked my client but I’m sure he’d be happy to share his medical records showing the aftercare he required when she defended herself against him.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thank you Ms. Fontaine, but I am only interested in the police report.” She handed over the report to the bailiff as she continued. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I do have video evidence of the many people she has instructed to trespass on my client’s property on her behalf.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I would be interested in that as well. Karl, would you turn on the screen?” The judge requested as she reviewed the report. “If you would, Ms. Fontaine, share the video evidence you’ve procured.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Val connected her phone to the screen and played the first video. “You’ll see this dated a week ago when my client first installed the surveillance. You’ll see a woman leave an item on the porch then return to a black Cadillac Escalade waiting on the street. I’ve confirmed the license plate and the vehicle does in fact belong to the defendant.” They all sat in silence as the video played. “You’ll find that woman in the video sitting directly behind the defendant in court today.” All heads turned to pick out which of the seven had been featured. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The next video is the following morning. Another item left by another woman sitting in court here and returning to the same black Escalade.” Hushed murmuring began to break out amongst the viewership. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“These continue on each day, including this very morning where two gentlemen placed a large item directly in front of my client’s door before returning to the same parked Escalade at four in the morning. This had been going on for a week before my client installed the surveillance. At one point before this they even sought her out at an appointment she had with me.” Val clicked to another video that showed security footage from her building where they saw Evanora herself placing an item outside Rio’s car.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Couldn’t find a stooge for that one I guess.” Rio muttered to Agatha as they watched.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“These actions, though seemingly benign, have been a great source of stress for my client to the point that it’s put not only her health at risk but also the health of her unborn child. The defendant knows these actions are unwarranted and unwanted yet she pursues them in an attempt to intimidate my client and without a protection order in place this kind of behavior will continue and cause further damage.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Thank you Ms. Fontaine. Is there anything else you would like to submit to the court at this time?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No, your honor.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Very well, Mr. Atwood, you have the floor.” With no immediate response from Christian, Agatha chanced a look in his direction. He was huddled with Evanora as the two of them exchanged harsh whispers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Mr. Atwood?!” Judge Horowitz called again, growing impatient as another few minutes passed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“One moment, your honor.” He eventually responded, holding up a finger to the judge in pause as he continued his conversation with her mother. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If you need some time with your client to review your arguments I’d prefer to postpone this until the end of my docket today as you have, so far, wasted enough of this court's time in your unpreparedness!” Agatha’s heart sank at the thought of prolonging this any further. She bit her lip as she waited for him to respond. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That won’t be necessary, your honor. We are prepared to move forward now.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“See that you do.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Your honor, my client is being vilified as some horrendous monster for wanting to ensure her grandchild is well provided for. All of these items that Ms. Harkness and her community have gifted the plaintiff are for the child to ensure a healthy and stable home that my client strongly believes her daughter is incapable of providing. Yes, she is aware that her presence is a disturbance but the wellbeing of the child outweighs the plaintiff’s own discomfort.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could feel her face radiating with anger at the statements. Of course she would feel Agatha was incapable of providing for her own child. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“With regard to the property my client shared the information she felt was necessary and her pursuit of ownership was only to keep the home and its contents within the family, as it had been for over a century, instead of being sold off to the highest bidder. We don’t disagree that their relationship is strained but a protection order is an unnecessary reactionary measure.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What leads your client to believe the child will not be provided for to cause her to take such actions?” Judge Horowitz asked</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Her daughter has a history of emotional instability causing her to make irrational and irrevocable decisions that my client believes may put the child in danger. Along with the fact that her </span>
<em>
<span>lifestyle</span>
</em>
<span> doesn’t lend itself to child rearing.” Christian sneered</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Objection! Your honor this hearing is not to determine my client’s ability to parent her child. If anything it aims to highlight the defendant’s inability to emotionally regulate herself to the point that she assaulted her own daughter.” Val snapped back</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Indeed. Objection sustained. Mr. Atwood, do you or your client have any comment regarding the incident cited in the police report?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“There was…” Christian started as he glanced back down at a scowling Evanora. “An unfortunate disagreement that did elicit a physical action from my client but that was paled in comparison to the violence the plaintiff’s </span>
<em>
<span>friend </span>
</em>
<span>took against her in retaliation.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m not seeing that mentioned in the police report.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“My client left immediately after the confrontation and was unable to give her statement of events.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That is unfortunate. Ms. Fontaine, do you have any additional statements at this time?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“The defendant claims her actions are in the best interest of the child, a child she would have no knowledge of if she and her cohorts hadn’t been stalking my client in the first place. My client along with her </span>
<em>
<span>partner</span>
</em>
<span>, who is a medical professional, are more than capable of caring for this child on their own. Therefore the defendant’s actions are manipulative and harmful, both physically and emotionally and if this court is interested in protecting the interest of the child they will see this protection order is justified and well overdue.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Your honor, if I may?” Christian piped up</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes, Mr. Atwood?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“They tried this once before and it was already struck down in a court of law.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Citing insufficient evidence!” Val retorted “There has been more than enough evidence collected since to justify this request. That was before the incident in Boston and before any of this additional “gift giving” harassment.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Your honor, my client knows there is no hope in salvaging the relationship she has with her daughter and she does not want to pursue it. What this order really intends to do is sever any possible relationship with her grandchild before it’s even begun.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Be that as it may, Mr. Atwood, I’m finding little reason to deny this request. Your client’s actions, however well intended they may have been, do constitute harassment and stalking at the very least. I have further concerns given that there are documented violent tendencies and given the delicate nature of the plaintiff’s state I fear I’m not willing to risk any further actions. Therefore I’m ruling a judgment in favor of the plaintiff. A five year protection order will be put into place with the option to renew for an additional five years at that time. The defendant will not be permitted to contact, pursue, or be within 100 yards of the plaintiff or the child during that time. You have the right to appeal this ruling; however, you must abide by this order until such a judgement is made. Any violation of this order will result in a $1,000.00 fine and a six month jail sentence. My clerk will have the appropriate documents available within the hour, any questions please direct to him. Court Adjourned.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>With a bang of the gavel the stillness was broken. Feet shuffled, voices murmured in shock and confusion, and a wave of relief washed over Agatha. It was over, she had won and her child was safe. She sat still and stunned as a smile grew across her face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We fucking did it!” Rio gasped as she turned to beam at Agatha. “You fucking did it!” She jumped up and gathered Val in a hug. “Holy shit! I can’t thank you enough!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Val chuckled nervously as she pried herself from Rio’s grasp, “My pleasure, as always!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Really, Val, thank you for everything!” Agatha sighed as she stood from the table. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m just glad it all worked out! You two should head out, I’ll wait around for the documentation and send it over with the forms for your donor. Until then, try and get some rest. I know today has been a lot.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, as soon as we get home I am crawling into bed and not leaving until work tomorrow!” Agatha snorted. “Really I could probably sleep the rest of the week!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, I don’t doubt that! You take care of yourself and that baby. Keep me in the loop if you can and let me know when he arrives. I’m excited for you, both of you! Especially now, you’ll really get to enjoy it!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, we certainly will! Thanks again!” Rio called as they quickly shuffled down the aisleway, bypassing the crowd of distraught and perplexed women hovering around Evanora. They hurried down the corridor and quickly jumped into an elevator that was just about to close. They stood like sardines squished into a can with the many other passengers along for the ride, pressed face to face so that the bump was squished between them. Rio looked down and laughed silently to herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha whispered, her crystal blue eyes gleaming curiously at her amusement.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I felt that.” Rio chuckled</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Seriously?” Agatha snorted in bemused bewilderment</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, kid’s got a helluva kick. Who knows, he might end up being a soccer pro!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh wouldn’t that be something!” Agatha chuckled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You better get ready for some early Saturday practices. Games in the afternoon. We could set up some goals in the back yard to practice!” Rio babbled animatedly</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s face scrunched with laughter, “I’m glad you’re excited but let’s give him a chance to get here before you redesign my backyard.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fine! I’ll be patient, but as soon as he’s walking I’m teaching him some drills! Can’t let that talent go to waste!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If you say so dear.” Agatha said, patting Rio’s cheek before stepping out of the elevator. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They rushed down the hallway hand in hand towards the entrance. As they neared the doors Rio stopped suddenly. “Really quick, I have to grab something from security.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha frowned as she watched Rio walk up to one of the guards and strike up a conversation. They spoke amicably for a moment before he handed something back to her which she stuffed into her pocket before jogging back over to Agatha. “What was that?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“They confiscated something on the way in. I was just getting it back.” She shrugged as she started to usher Agatha towards the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What exactly did they confiscate?” Agatha hitched an eyebrow as a smirk tugged at the corner of her lips. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“My father’s switchblade.” Rio quickly mumbled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio!” Agatha gasped as they pushed through the first set of doors. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I forgot it was in my pocket. I’m just glad they gave it back.” Rio shrugged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Is that something you normally carry around?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Eh, depends on the day. Today it seemed appropriate.” She smiled back at Agatha who just rolled her eyes and pushed through the final door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As they stepped out into the crisp spring air Agatha breathed in the sweet scents of the daffodils and hyacinth in the nearby garden. Birds were calling to each other and the sun was just beginning to peek behind some passing clouds. It was as if nature itself was rejoicing in their win. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio guided her down the first few steps before glancing back with a smile to ensure she was alright. Then, just as she was about to turn back, her face fell. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whatever happens, keep walking.” She warned Agatha as she pulled her in front of her. She pressed a hand to her back and hurried her down the stairs as a voice rang out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“AGATHA!” Shouted Evanora as the heavy doors slammed shut behind her. Agatha’s heart sank but she refused to turn around. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“AGATHA MARIE HARKNESS! YOU LOOK AT ME WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU! THIS IS NOT OVER!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Keep going, I'll meet you at the car.” Rio whispered to her before stepping away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio don’t…” she cried as she turned and reached out to stop her but Rio was already half way up the stairs and almost toe to toe with her mother. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I don’t know, it seems pretty over to me! I’d go back inside if I were you before you end up behind bars.” Rio informed coolly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’m not talking to you you insolent little faggot. This is between me and my daughter.” Evanora spat viciously. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh it’s going to be like that is it? Well, you’re going to have to get through me first.” Rio postured confidently in front of her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Evanora tried to side step Rio but she swerved and blocked her path. “Out of my way before I do something we’ll both regret.” Evanora warned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Do it.” Rio inched closer, hands in her pockets and eyes glowing with antagonistic fury. “I dare you.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Evanora growled with rage as she brought up her hands to push Rio down the stairs. Rio quickly stepped to the side, dodging the attack and grabed one of Evanora’s arms to twist it around her back as she pulled out her switchblade with the other hand and pressed the tip of it firmly against her lower spine. Evanora’s breath hitched in shock as she winced at the way her arm was being held. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Rio! Please! You promised!” Agatha cried in horror from the bottom of the stairs. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I’d listen to her if I were you.” Evanora snarled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“No you listen to me!” Rio grunted as she tightened her grip on Evanora. “You feel this blade pressing at your back? You wouldn’t believe how easy it would be for me to slide this in between your vertebrae and paralyze you right here on these steps.” Her voice was calm but menacing. “Now, because I love your daughter more than you ever possibly could, I’m not going to do that. Not today at least. But if I </span>
<em>
<span>ever </span>
</em>
<span>catch you or any of your fucking cult members sniffing around either of us again, a fine and a jail sentence is going to be the least of your worries. Got it?” She said as she pressed the blade just far enough in to slice a hole into the back of Evanora’s dress. Evanora nodded reluctantly. “I’m sorry, I didn’t quite catch that.” Rio said, twisting her arm further. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yes…I understand.” Evanora grunted in pain. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good. I’m glad we could come to an agreement on that. Now I’m going to let you go and you’re going to turn around, say nothing, and head back inside. Do I make myself clear?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Crystal.” Evanora grimaced. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio tucked the blade back into her pocket and released Evanora who scurried in embarrassment to the crowd of people gathering at the doors to watch the confrontation. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Satisfied that she had avoided a catastrophe, Rio shuffled down the stairs to Agatha who greeted her with a slap. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ouch! Hey! What was that for?!” She exclaimed as she rubbed her cheek. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You promised me Rio!” Agatha groaned in frustration. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I didn’t hurt her! I could have done a lot worse!” Rio explained as she stretched out her jaw. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What did you say to her?” Agatha demanded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I told her to back off, that whatever it was she was after wasn’t worth going to jail over.” Rio insisted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“That’s it?” Agatha asked, eyeing her skeptically. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I may have been a little more persuasive with my word choices but that’s the gist.” Rio shrugged innocently. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha pursed her lips, trying not to be amused by Rio’s antics as she started to walk towards the car. “You’re lucky you’re cute otherwise I’d make you walk home.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ah! You think I’m cute?!” Rio giggled as she rushed to catch up with Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Sometimes.” Agatha smirked as Rio caught her hand. “When you’re being naughty.” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Ooo, I should be naughty more often!” Rio smirked. “Would you slap me again if I was?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You want me to slap you again?” Agatha snorted </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Um…yeah. It was kind of hot.” Rio admitted bashfully</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Hmm, I’ll have to keep that in mind.” She winked playfully as they continued to the car. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Despite the manner in which it had happened she was grateful that Rio had handled her mother and they were free to finally move on. Free to be excited about her future, their future together, and the new life that was going to be joining them before they knew it. </span>

<p><span>It had been a long and busy shift and Rio was pouring over case files when the call came in. A mother and child had just been admitted by ambulance through to the emergency bay. The child had been breathing on his own but was now having difficulties, chance of a collapsed lung, also signs of cardiac issues. She would find out more when the team transferred to surgery. </span></p><p><span>She wasted no time and rushed out into the darkened hallways, eerily silent, void of any other signs of life. She ran for what seemed like forever before she made it to surgery prep to scrub in. Still not a soul in sight but she could hear a flurry of voices and movements bustling just behind the door. She suited up, head to toe in hospital teal and pushed her way through the doors to join the rabble already working. </span></p><p><span>She was hit with a wash of antiseptic, iodine, and the iron-y sweet smell of blood. The bodies around her moved in a furious focus as machines blared their songs in a steady blaring rhythm around them. She tried to push her way through to the table but found it too crowded to gain access. She called out for an update but was met with silence and dismissal. Growing frustrated she tried to shout. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“STATUS UPDATE!?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Her throat ached with the fury of her shouting but it was as if her voice was moving through water, nearly soundless and indistinguishable from the cacophony of chaos around her. Bodies continued to shuffle and move as if she was invisible, merely a ghost observing the scene. She looked around in a panicked confusion trying to find someone that would acknowledge her but even as she cornered a nurse the man refused to respond and only rushed past her to care for the patients.  </span></p><p><span>She stepped back for a moment and watched everyone buzz around her like a swarm of wasps until the alarms began to blare their unyielding drone. Slowly, one by one, people began to step away from the scene, their efforts now in vain. The lights around her dimmed as they left until a single bulb flickered on the tiny form on the table and the woman now shrouded in hospital blankets beside them, her arm dangling loosely off the side of the bed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio let out a shuddering breath as she stood in this tomb, trying to make sense of the chaos and aftermath. </span><em><span>What had even happened? Why didn’t they let her in?</span></em> <em><span>Why did no one let her help? </span></em><span>She slowly crept forward to hover over the bodies, her eyes first drawn to the infant. This frail and feeble creature freshly torn from his mother’s womb. He was so small, he couldn’t have been more than five pounds if that. It had been too soon, his body unable to sustain itself outside his mother’s protection. The evidence of their recent separation still adorned his body, the cord that gave him life still tethered to the organ that had grown alongside him. </span><em><span>Couldn’t she have given him a chance to survive? If only they had allowed her the chance to try! </span></em></p><p><span>She drew her mask down as she reached out a finger to press into his minuscule palm. It was so tiny it would have barely wrapped around her finger. She let her other hand drift to rest atop his head as her thumb combed back the few soft brown curls that clung to his peaceful face. His eyes settled closed, his mouth curled into a pout as if at any moment a cry could burst forth. But no sound came, no movements made, just a cold stillness beneath her fingertips. She could feel the tears beginning to well in her eyes, the grief she held for him, for his mother whose last moments brought him into this world only to perish. </span></p><p><span>She turned slowly to face her, the woman who had sacrificed everything, her body, her soul, for the life that now lay still beside her. Her arm that hung loose from the table never having a chance to hold him close and whisper to him of the love she must have held. Rio’s heart broke at the thought, each of them so close yet so far. </span><em><span>How could she let it remain? </span></em></p><p><span>She turned back to the child and gathered him up in blankets, at last separating him from his bind, and cradled him close. She ducked down and gathered the mother’s arm so that it rested at her side under the cover. It too was cold to the touch but stiffness had not yet reached her. She settled the baby on her chest and brought her hands up to rest around him. </span></p><p><span>As she did so the blankets slid down revealing a halo of untamed dark brown curls and waves that seemed to go on forever. Her heart stuttered in her chest as she gathered a strand between her fingers and pulled the length towards her. The faintest hint of lilac and honeysuckle drifted up towards her and she could feel her body go numb with terror. </span><em><span>It couldn’t be! </span></em><span>She stood, hand hovering just above the edge of the sheet, her fingers shaking in fear as they dared to inch closer and reveal what her heart already knew. She slowly slid the fabric down to reveal a familiar pair of icy blue eyes glazed over and staring back at her. Rio wailed in horror at the image of Agatha’s lifeless body before her. She flung herself atop her as she screamed out,</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“NO! NO THIS CAN’T… THIS CAN'T BE HAPPENING! PLEASE, MY LOVE! COME BACK TO ME!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>As she lay there heaving with sorrow at her loss she heard a voice calling her name. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Rio? Rio…</span></em><span>”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Then she felt her body being shaken and opened her eyes to see who was disturbing her grief. As she blinked into focus she saw Agatha, perched on the edge of the bed, a look of worried concern strewn across her face. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sweetheart are you alright?” Agatha asked as she brushed Rio’s sweat drenched hair back away from her face. Rio’s heart flooded with relief at the sight of her. It was just a bad dream, a nightmare that had seemed all too real. She let out a heaving sigh in solace as she sat up and quickly gathered Agatha in her arms. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That bad huh?” Agatha chuckled as Rio squeezed her tight, unwilling to let her go. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You have no idea!” She buried her head in her cascading locs, breathing in the fresh, sweet, floral scent. “I thought I’d lost you!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t worry! I’m right here.” She cooed as she rubbed soothing circles along Rio’s back. “What time did you end up getting in last night?” She asked as Rio finally released her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Not until like 3:00. What time is it?” Rio asked as she searched for her phone.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Almost 11. I came in to wake you to get ready for lunch and you were whimpering and smothering that pillow.” She nodded towards a crumpled pillow that featured an unmistakable drool mark. “Did you have a rough night?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Definitely more intense than I had anticipated.” Rio yawned as she stretched. “Someone went into labor a week before their scheduled c-section so it was all hands on deck. Nothing like open heart surgery at one in the morning.” Rio sighed as she flopped back down onto the bed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I figured when I didn’t see you during our midnight snack something had come up. Did everything go well?” Agatha asked</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, everyone made it out alright but it was touch and go for a while.” Rio admitted as flashes work the night before blended with the remnants of her dream. “Do you…feel alright?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes!” Agatha laughed. “Perfect fine! In fact we went down to that donut shop you like and picked out a few. I tried to save you some of the hot pepper jelly donut but he had other plans.” Agatha shrugged in apology as she stroked a hand along the surface of her swollen belly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio sighed in relief as a smile rested on her lips “Oh! I see how it is! You’re gonna talk mama into eating all the good ones.” Rio chuckled and propped herself up to nuzzle her face against the bump. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“He’s very convincing, you know!” Agatha insisted as she smiled down at Rio’s affection. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don’t doubt that for a second.” Rio scoffed as she pressed a kiss to the surface. “What </span><em><span>did </span></em><span>you manage to save for me?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha nodded towards a box on the nightstand. “They’re in there. There’s a coffee one, something with cinnamon and salted caramel, and a strawberry one. Eat as much as you like, I’m going to finish getting ready.” She said as she struggled to pull herself from the bed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Finish what? You look fine! It’s just lunch with Lilia!” Rio called after her as she shuffled to sit at the edge of the bed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio, this shirt barely covers my stomach and these pants aren’t going to fit if I’m planning to eat anything.” She explained as she breezed over to the closet. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ok I get the pants thing but that shirt’s fine. So what if your stomach shows a bit, you are like 8 months pregnant!” Rio shrugged as she reached for the box of donuts.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No! Not yet! Seven and a half! I don’t need you rushing this any more than it already has been.” Agatha chided.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sorry. Seven and a half.” Rio rolled her eyes as she opened the box. “Hey! There’s a bite out of every one of these!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha wandered out of the closet, half undressed with a new outfit in hand, sporting a less than apologetic smile as she headed to the bathroom. “What can I say? I needed to know which one he preferred.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Likely story! I guess I should be glad I’m getting any at this point.” She grabbed the salted caramel donut and threw the box on the bed before wandering into the bathroom to sit on the counter and watch as Agatha got ready. “You sure you’re up for this today?” She asked, eyebrows raised skeptically as she took a bite of the donut.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Why wouldn’t I be?” Agatha frowned as she placed a few bobby pins into her mouth to hold while she put up her hair. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I wasn’t sure if you’d rather rest today, I know you have a crazy week coming up and you heard what Dr. Allen said.” Rio reminded her, treading cautiously as to not spark an argument. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And I’m following those guidelines. Not doing anything too strenuous, reducing stress where I can, resting as much as possible.” Agatha replied snidely.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Except for today.” Rio scoffed under her breath. Agatha turned to glare at her as she took a large bite of the donut. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Like you said, it’s just lunch with Lilia, I think I can manage.” Agatha replied with an irritated smirk. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ok, so maybe it’s a little more than </span><em><span>just </span></em><span>lunch. Do you really want to hash everything out right now? We could always wait until after the baby is born, she’ll understand.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Why? I'd rather get it over with and move on.” Agatha waved her hand dismissively as she continued getting ready. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I get that, I do, I’m just worried it might be a bit stressful right at this moment.” Rio posited</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Stressful for who, hon? Between the two of us you’re the one who's been a nervous wreck lately.” Agatha scoffed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“For good reason! Last week with your mother was intense to say the least. Then Dr. Allen only reaffirmed my concerns about your health and the risks that it poses as we get closer to delivery. And of course you refuse to slow down or take a step back at work, despite what she told you!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are we really doing this again?” Agatha groaned as she rolled her eyes.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, at this point I know there’s no changing your mind about it, even though it drives me crazy!” Rio sighed heavily as she finished her donut. “I love you, and I love her, and I want everyone to be happy and get along but I’m also well aware of the potential this has to turn into a </span><em><span>thing </span></em><span>which you don’t need right now.” Rio stressed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio, I’ll be fine! After dealing with my mother this is going to be a breeze. There’s definitely a few things we’ll need to discuss, but your aunt seems…reasonable. Coo coo for sure, but at least we can have a conversation without her spewing some bigoted nonsense. And as long as she doesn’t pull any stunts…” Agatha narrowed her gaze to Rio as she brought up a warning finger. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh believe, me she is on thin ice and she knows it! She promised me she would be on her best behavior.” Rio groaned as she leaned back against the mirror. “I guess you’re right. She </span><em><span>was </span></em><span>really excited when I called and asked if she wanted to meet us for lunch. Despite what she did, she does really like you.” Rio let a shy smirk play on her lips.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh? That’s news to me!” Agatha snorted a little doubtfully as she began brushing her teeth. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Really though. I don’t think she would have gone to those lengths with any of my other girlfriends. She probably would have sat back and waited for it to blow up on its own. Not to say that that would have happened in our case but…she does have a sense about these things.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh really?” Agatha mumbled through a mouthful of toothpaste.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I think she saw how happy you made me and wanted to make sure I didn’t fuck it up.” Rio chuckled to herself, her gaze drifting to fixate at a point on the floor as her mind pondered a familiar question. “I do sometimes wonder what would have happened if she never told me.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh yeah? And how does that usually play out?” Agatha asked as she dried her face. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Honestly it could have gone any number of ways. I figure, you would have probably realized eventually, definitely before me.” Rio reasoned</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t be so sure!” Agatha scoffed as she started to dig through her makeup bag. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“But then I wonder…would you have even told me or just ghosted me?” Rio smirked as she raised an eyebrow in Agatha’s direction.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hmm, hard to say…” Agatha replied only half engaged in the conversation as she applied a lip stain. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Come on, if you had to guess…” Rio urged as she turned to gather Agatha’s attention in the mirror. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I mean…I don’t know </span><em><span>how </span></em><span>I would have told you!” Agatha sighed exasperatedly as she threw the lipstain back in the bag. “I probably would have assumed this would scare you away and called the whole thing off without ever saying anything about it.” She shrugged as she picked up her eyeliner.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You know I wouldn’t have gone quietly. Once I have my mind set it’s pretty hard to dissuade me.” Rio insisted as she laid herself down in front of where Agatha was trying to ready herself.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well I know that now!” Agatha gruffed as she threw down the pencil in her hand. “And what if I had told you? Huh? Do you think if I had come to you and told you I was pregnant you would have been as adamant about making this work?” Agatha asked, eyebrows hitched in challenge. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio mulled the question over for a moment. “I want to say yes…but really… I don’t know. I’ve been burned in so many other relationships I could definitely see myself taking it as a hint to move on.” Rio replied as she blinked up at the ceiling. Agatha could feel a lump form in her throat at that admission. “But then again,” Rio smiled, turning to Agatha, “for that brief moment you did ghost me, I thought I was going to go insane without you. Having that heads up really did give me time to think about what I really wanted.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh? And what was that?” Agatha asked as she crossed her arms above her bump.</span></p><p> </p><p><span> Rio hopped down off the counter and moved to stand behind Agatha, resting her head on her shoulder as she watched them both in the mirror. “You!” That simple word elicited a spark that drew a flush to Agatha’s cheeks. “And him, of course” She guided her hands down around the swell, feeling him move along the surface. “And this life we are building together.” </span></p><p><span>She pressed a kiss to Agatha’s cheek, who turned her head in response, her ocean blue eyes reflecting the love Rio held for her. She turned further, bringing a hand up to guide Rio’s lips to hers in a tender but all consuming kiss. Their mouths moved in sync, a perfect rhythm of exploration and discovery as they vied to show and receive the love between them. </span></p><p><span>Agatha, at last, smiled, parting their lips. “I guess I should be thanking your aunt then.” </span></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><span>—-------------------------------------------------------</span></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><span>An hour later they were seated at the restaurant, Agatha was on her phone sorting through work emails, her knee bouncing in irritated anticipation as they waited for Lilia to arrive. Rio was resting her head against the back of the booth, her gaze fixed on Agatha as she soaked in every detail of the woman beside her. How her long hair was swirled in a loose bun on top of her head that had already surrendered a few strands to fall and frame her sharp features. How her lips puckered as her eyes darted over one diatribe after another as she sorted through her inbox. The way her nose would scrunch when she read something that particularly displeased her. Every feature, every mannerism she studied carefully as if it might disappear right before her eyes. For, even though it had been hours since she woke from her horrid dream, she couldn’t shake the nagging worry it had stirred in her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Cariño, did you remember to take your medication this morning?” She asked as her worrying became insurmountable. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes, dear.” Agatha rolled her eyes dismissively as she continued tapping away on her phone. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Just making sure.” Rio breathed nervously. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re always so worried about me!” Agatha snorted as a smirk tugged at her lips. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Who me? No! Never!” Rio snorted as she tried to play off her concern. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You can relax. I told you I’m doing everything Dr. Allen said.” Agatha set her phone down as she turned her attention fully to Rio. “In fact, you’d be proud of me, I even meditated after my walk this morning.” She said as she preened, tucking a loose piece of hair behind her ear.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh really?” Rio replied with a look of amused suspicion. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So maybe it was only five minutes, and I may have been eating a donut at the same time but I’m counting it.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span> “Hey, I’ll give you an A for effort.” She leaned over and gave Agatha a peck on the cheek before resting her head on her shoulder. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You did tell your aunt we were meeting here at noon right?” Agatha grumbled as she looked at her watch.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I actually told her 11:45.” Rio snorted</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You know she’s nearly 20 minutes late!” Agatha gruffed, growing ever more impatient by the minute. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She’s usually running late but I’ll admit, this is a record even for her.” Rio sat up and quickly checked her phone and saw it void of notifications. “I’ll give her a few more minutes and then give her a call. We can order something to snack on if you’re hungry.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, I’m sure as soon as we order something she’ll show up so we might as well wait.” Agatha sighed disappointedly</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You sure? She won’t mind. Besides you do seem… a little…”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“A little what?!” Agatha snapped</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio bit her lip, debating with herself before she finally responded “Hangry.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I am not hangry, I just find it irritating when people are inconsiderate of other people’s time.” Agatha replied, doing a poor job of hiding her frustration.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Where else do you have to be?” Rio snickered </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Nowhere, but if you say we’re eating at noon and we don’t even order until 12:30, that means the food isn’t even going to get to our table until almost one. I feel like I’m allowed to be a little…”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hangry?” Rio snorted</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fine! Yes! I’m hangry.” Agatha groaned. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Then let’s get an appetizer at least.” Rio chuckled to herself as she reached for the menu. “Look, they have shishito peppers, he’ll love those. Marinated cucumber salad, basically pickles. Roasted artichoke? Anything sound good?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ugh, all of it! I’m so hungry I could eat my face.” Agatha groaned as she collapsed forward resting her forehead on the table.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Then all of it you shall have, my love! Just help me flag down our waiter if you see him.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Honestly I’ve not seen him since we sat down.” Agatha pouted as she sat up and scouted the restaurant. “That’s it! I’m going to go track him down.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are you sure? I can go find him.” Rio offered</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio, I’m fine, I need to stretch my legs anyway. You figure out where your aunt is.” Agatha pointed at Rio as she pried herself from the booth with a grunt.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’ll give her a call and make sure she knows today is Sunday. Sometimes she gets her wires crossed.”  </span></p><p><span>As Agatha shuffled off Rio quickly dialed Lilia and brought the phone up to her ear. It rang a few times before going to voicemail. Rio groaned as she hung up and immediately redialed. Just as the phone began to ring again she caught sight of Lilia’s ancient conversion van rolling into the parking lot. She hung up the phone and sat back as she watched her struggle to park, in the end taking up a space and a half. After a few minutes Lilia stumbled out of the vehicle, flung a mammoth sized tote bag over her shoulder, fumbled with her keys for a bit, then scurried into the restaurant to meet them. Rio rolled her eyes as she rose to wave her over to the table. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So sorry I’m late, doll! I was gardening and lost track of time then I couldn’t find my damn keys!” Lilia huffed as she swallowed Rio in a hug. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Or a matching pair of shoes apparently.” Rio snorted</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Lilia glanced down only now realizing her mistake. “Ah, well, it’s a fashion statement. How are you? How’s your lady love? Is she here?” Lilia looked around expectantly</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, she went to find our waiter, she’ll be right back. Remember, when she gets here, no funny stuff. Ignore whatever your intuition is telling you to do. At least for today alright?” Rio pleaded.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I know, I know, best behavior! Are you alright dear? You’re looking a little knackered.” Lilia asked as they settled into the booth.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m alright, just tired.” Rio yawned</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Late night?” Lilia asked as she shoved her enormous bag into the corner. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah but I slept pretty much until we had to leave. I shouldn't be this tired!” Rio frowned. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Bad dreams then?” Lilia pried, her eyes twinkling knowingly.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“We’re not doing this.” Rio warned</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Doing what?” Lilia shrugged innocently</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Reading into things! I don’t need you overanalyzing my nightmares right now.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What’s there to overanalyze? You’ve told me practically nothing!” Lilia threw her hands up in surrender as Rio glared daggers at her. “Though…”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t.” Rio grumbled through gritted teeth</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“If you’re having nightmares again…” Lilia continued</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Lilia I said don’t!” Rio’s tone was severe and final.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright! Alright! I’ll drop it, for now at least.” She agreed, at last resigning herself.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What did I tell you! As soon as I order this food she’s going to show up!” Agatha scoffed as she sidled up to the table. “Hello Lilia, glad you could finally join us.” she huffed as she scooted into the booth. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I was honored by the invitation!” She beamed back at Agatha, seemingly ignorant of her irritation. “It’s so good to see you again, dear! How’s everything? How have you been feeling? How’s the little one? It’s been a while since we’ve all seen each other!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It certainly has! I think the last time I saw you you managed to run a pregnancy test on me </span><em><span>without </span></em><span>my knowledge.” Agatha leaned back in her seat as she crossed her arms over her stomach and glared annoyedly at Lilia.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ah! Right to it I see. Well, I guess there is no point in beating around the bush then.” Lilia shrugged apologetically “A terribly regrettable decision on my part. Truly. I’m so sorry for overstepping and pulling that stunt. I should have known better.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s the understatement of the century.” Rio mumbled</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Why though? You didn’t have to do all of that, you could have just come and talked to me.” Agatha insisted</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’d be a little rude wouldn’t it? You’re not really supposed to ask people if they’re pregnant.” Lilia snorted as she took a drink of her water. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha let out a breath of laughter in disbelief. “So, let me get this straight. You knew it would be rude to ask me if I was pregnant but not rude to rig up a pregnancy test in the bathroom and go to Rio with it?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It seemed like the right idea at the time, but then again so did the mushrooms.” Lilia winced in regret.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Wait, you had taken mushrooms?” Rio glared at her</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I was microdosing, but may have gotten carried away with it. That’s beside the point.” Lilia waved her hands as she redirected the conversation. “I can’t tell you the number of times I’ve tried to warn or inform people directly of what lies ahead only for it to completely backfire and cause more damage than I could ever imagine. I suspected you might not have known, but then again I couldn’t be sure. I knew if I’d talked to you I would’ve inevitably said the wrong thing or you wouldn’t have believed me and it would likely have destroyed this beautiful relationship you two were building.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Um…it nearly did!” Rio grumbled.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And yet here you two are, closer than ever!” Lilia smiled tightly before turning her attention back to Agatha. “This one barely believed me and I had the tests to prove it! People don’t tend to listen to warnings, especially if there’s no evidence to back it up, so I’ve learned to either bite my tongue or find the proof. I chose the latter. Which was selfish of me and I’m so incredibly sorry for that. As for choosing to tell Rio, we’re family and she’s used to my eccentricities. I knew I wouldn’t be blamed for ruining everything if I talked with her first. Besides, she needed to know, especially if you didn’t.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Why exactly?” Agatha asked through pursed lips, eyebrows hitched in doubtful skepticism. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I know my niece quite well, better than she knows herself half the time,” Lilia glanced pointedly at Rio, “after all these years of disastrous relationships she was just within reach of having the life she always wanted and deserved so long as she kept her head about her. Telling her gave her the chance to put things into perspective and be there for you in the ways you needed, especially if you didn’t know.” Lilia elaborated, explaining casually as if this was all reasonable justification for what she had done. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha’s face twisted in contemplation as she considered what Lilia was saying just as a more personal question rose to the surface. “How did you know I was pregnant, before the test?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh honey, I saw it the moment I met you!” Lilia laughed as if she had asked the most obvious question.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How could you? I didn’t even know!” Agatha half shouted, exasperatedly</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Lilia bit her lip as she glanced at Rio who rolled her eyes and motioned for her to continue. “Call it a blessing, call it a curse, but I’ve always seen things for what they truly are. You had that glow about you for sure but more than that, this little one already had quite an aura about himself. Then, of course, your cards only reconfirmed my suspicions.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha shook her head laughing at the incredulity, “Unbelievable! So sheer dumb luck and obscene nosiness! Got it!” She barked back at Lilia. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Insight darling! If you’re open minded enough and willing to receive it the universe will tell you all you need to know!” She explained with another pointed glance to Rio. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I have an order of the peppers, a cucumber salad, and a roasted artichoke. Have you all had a chance to decide on your entree?” The waiter interrupted as he plopped down the plates between them.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Um…I think we may need another minute.”  Rio replied as she watched the simmering tension threatening to burst forth from Agatha. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t go far, it will only be a minute!” Agatha snapped as he started to walk away.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Uh, yeah, no worries, I’m just going to check on a couple other tables and I’ll be right back to get your order.” He replied nervously before bolting from their table.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Why don’t we take a break, figure out what we want, and eat a bit before we dive back in?” Rio suggested trying to de-escalate the situation.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fine by me!” Agatha huffed as she slid the plate of peppers towards her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>They sat in an awkward silence as Lilia perused the menu and Agatha proceeded to devour the food in front of her. Rio sat cautiously on the edge of her seat, her body practically vibrating with anxiety at how the conversation was devolving. She held her breath, hoping that with some sustenance in her, Agatha would be more open to resolving things before they escalated any further. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>With the plates cleared and their order having been taken, Rio cautiously checked in with Agatha. “Feeling better, cariño?” Rio asked gently as a small smile tugged at the corner of her lips. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don’t feel like I’m about to murder someone anymore, if that’s what you’re asking.” Agatha replied snarkily as she shot a glare to Lilia.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Good, now as we continue, let’s all try and stay calm, there’s no need to get worked up at this point. What’s done is done. We’re all just trying to figure out how to move forward, ok?” Rio posited as her worried eyes bore into Agatha. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha rolled her eyes and let out a deep sigh. “I guess at this point my only question is how am I expected to trust you, given everything?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fair enough. I haven’t really given you any reason to trust me, even though I was right about my suspicions from the start.” Lilia grumbled. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Lilia!” Rio scolded </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s beside the point.” She waved her hands, brushing off Rio’s scathing glare. “All I can say is I’m sorry for how I acted, and I regret it deeply. Overall I just want the best for you, all of you, and though it may take time to earn your trust back I’m willing to do what it takes for us to be on good terms, even if that means giving you two space.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha gave a sideways glance to Rio as she considered Lilia’s apology. She seemed genuine in her remorse and though she was a bit kooky, Agatha couldn’t deny her authenticity and the care she had for them both. Somehow, despite all Lilia had done, she had found this soft and tender place inside Agatha’s heart where she could only assume her mothers love would have existed, if Evanora had had the capacity to show it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Thank you Lilia, I appreciate your transparency and effort. You are an important part of Rio’s life and she is an important part of mine now. Given that, I’m willing to move forward and put the past behind us, so long as you feel comfortable coming to me with any questions or concerns rather than plotting behind my back going forward.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Lilia shot a quick glance at Rio before replying, “Seems reasonable enough.” She flashed Agatha a tight but agreeable smile. “Oh, before I forget, I did bring you something!” Lilia gasped as she began to dig around in her purse. “I found it the other day when I was cleaning out one of my closets, right before you called me about this lunch actually, and it struck me as something you might like.” Agatha threw an anxious glance at Rio as she waited nervously for Lilia to find whatever she was looking for. “Ah! Here it is!” She pulled out a small purple satin pouch and handed it to Agatha. “It was something I had saved for Rio but it never really seemed to suit her taste and I figured she wouldn’t mind if I gave it to you.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha cautiously undid the ribbon holding it closed and shook the item out of the bag into her palm. As she turned it over in her hand she realized it was a small golden locket, the face of which held a purple stone with three white, statue-like figures inlaid in the center. She glanced over at Rio whose eyes were growing glassy with tears.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It was my mother’s.” Rio breathed as her voice cracked. “I didn’t realize you still had it.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Of course I did! I figured one day you’d find someone worthy of gifting it to, so I held onto it. It’s good luck, you know! A family heirloom, one of the few we still have.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are you sure you want me to have this?” Agatha asked as she looked back and forth between the two. Rio nodded as she wiped a tear from the corner of her eye.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Consider it a peace offering and a welcome to the family.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha examined the small token in her hand. The weight of it felt more significant than any of the numerous items her family had ever owned. She slid the locket around her neck and leaned over to press a soft kiss to Rio’s lips. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Thank you, that…that means a lot. More than you realize after the week we just survived with my mother.” Agatha groaned</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh dear, Rio mentioned that whole ordeal was hellacious!” Lilia exclaimed just as the rest of their food arrived.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hellacious doesn’t even begin to cover it.” Rio grumbled “That woman is the spawn of Satan himself! You wouldn’t believe the shit she tried to pull!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m sorry to hear that.” Lilia cooed sympathetically.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s fine, really. It all worked out in our favor and now she’s legally bound from interfering in our lives.” Agatha sighed, relieved.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s always baffling to me how parents can turn on their own children. And now, she’s missing out on what I’m sure would have been the highlight of her life because of it.” Lilia reasoned</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, she never wanted me. I’m more than convinced of that and I’ve made my peace with it. But, for some reason, she had it in her head that grandmother was the role she was really meant to play.” Agatha groaned as she dug into her salad.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ha! As if! Even the judge saw how terrible she was and set that shit in stone for 10 years.” Rio scoffed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well five but we can renew it.” Agatha clarified. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m glad you have some peace of mind at least and can focus on more important things. Speaking of, how much longer until we get to meet the little bambino?” Lilia asked</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m due in about six weeks, ugh which feels horrifying to say!” She turned to Rio half shocked. “Is it really only six weeks?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, just about.” Rio chuckled. “I told you we really have to start moving with getting things ready now that the lawsuit is settled.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck! It’s all happening so fast. I have no idea how we’re going to get everything together in time, especially since I’m in crunch time now with the festival.” Rio flashed a sideways half annoyed half concerned look in Agatha’s direction.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What festival?” Lilia asked as the waiter delivered their food. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha is in charge of organizing the May Festival for music hall.” Rio explained</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh! That’s always been one of my favorites. I’ve heard you’re expanding it a bit this year.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Expanding is an understatement! Not only will we have our regular festivities inside, we’ll be taking over the block and hosting a night market with artists and performances stationed around the building and a second stage in the back. This is set for every weekend in May and each weekend is a different theme. It’s been an undertaking to say the least. Only this week and next to try and pull everything together, hopefully.” Agatha let out a deep sigh of frustration. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Knowing you it will all come together perfectly in the end.” Rio beamed as she gathered Agatha’s hand to press a kiss to her knuckles. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well if you need help getting anything together for the baby I’m more than happy to assist. I have too much time on my hands as it is.” Lilia offered</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Honestly I’ll probably take you up on that. I don’t think we’ll have a choice at this point, we’ll need all the help we can get. Ooo, which reminds me, what are you doing next Saturday?” Rio asked excitedly.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Same as yesterday, same as everyday, whatever the fuck I want. Why? You got something in mind?” Lilia replied, eyes gleaming in anticipation.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio shot Agatha a devious look to which she just rolled her eyes. “I’m throwing Agatha a baby shower, would you like to come?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Lilia’s face couldn’t hide her initial displeasure but she quickly put on a brave face, “You know if it were anyone else I would say absolutely not, those things usually make me want to pull my hair out, but for you two of course I’ll come.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha snorted in laughter at the bluntness of her reply. “Honestly I feel the exact same way! I tried to convince her it wasn’t worth the effort but she insisted.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“The two of you are party poopers! I promise it’s going to be a good time!” Rio exclaimed as she scowled at them both. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s going to be nauseating but I fear I don’t have a choice at this point.” Agatha groaned.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You really don’t trust me to pull this off do you?” Rio challenged</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh I trust you completely, it’s the rest of those people I’m not too sure about!” Agatha sneered, her nose wrinkling in disgust. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Our friends?” Rio laughed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Please! They’re going to make a bigger deal out of this than it needs to be. You know Jen won't be able to help herself!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised, in fact I bet you’ll even enjoy yourself!” Rio goaded with a taunting smile. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh really? Is that so? And what exactly are the stakes?” Agatha replied, narrowing her eyes in challenge. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“If you enjoy yourself like I know you will, smiling, laughing, having an overall good time, you get to be the one to write the thank you notes.” Rio said decisively.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And if it’s the moderately enjoyable afternoon of forced pleasantries that I expect it will be you’ll write them?” Agatha reasoned</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Seems fair.” Rio shrugged, unbothered by the challenge. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright, deal.” Agatha agreed as she returned to her salad. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Haha! Bet! You’re going to have so much fun you’re not going to know what to do with yourself.” Rio replied giddily, nearly overcome with excitement. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re setting that bar pretty high. I hope you know that.” Agatha warned</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh baby I’m the high jump champ! Better get that writing hand ready. You don’t want to get a cramp!” Rio taunted</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You two really are made for each other!” Lilia chuckled as she observed the two bickering. “Is there a registry or anything specific I should bring?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha’s friend Jen, you remember her from karaoke, she put together a registry, I’ll send it to you.” Rio replied</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That would be lovely!” Lilia smiled as she pushed her empty plate away from her. “Well ladies, I hate to eat and run but I have hot yoga at two and Bob, who’s running the session today, won’t let you in if you’re more than five minutes late!” Lilia groaned as she scooted herself from the bench. As she stood she sifted through her bag to pull out a crumpled wad of cash that she threw on the table to cover the bill. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You don’t have to do that! I’ve got it!” Rio chuckled as she and Agatha stood to say their goodbyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Please, it’s the least I can do!” Lilia replied with a dismissive wave. “It was so good to see you, sweetheart!” She leaned in, smothering Rio in a hug before turning to Agatha. “You two take it easy, don’t let this one give you any trouble!” She said, pointing a thumb in Rio’s direction before she wrapped an arm around Agatha’s side and let the other rest on the swell. Just as her fingers grazed the surface her breath caught. She glanced down at the bump before her eyes locked with Rio’s, flashing her a brief but undeniable look of worry and alarm with Agatha none the wiser. She quickly hid her concern with a smile as she turned back to Agatha, “Take care of each other.” she muttered with a slight unease in her voice as her gaze flashed back to Rio, “Get some good sleep while you can and I’ll see you both on Saturday.” With a wave of her fingers she scurried out the door and sped away in her van.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She is absolutely bonkers, but I have to say I’m fond of her…” Agatha babbled as she settled back in to finish her meal. Rio stood silently for a moment, eyes fixed on the door, as she tried to decipher the warning look Lilia had given her, the concern in her eyes reigniting the pang of worry she had woken up with.  </span><em><span>What did she know? What had she seen? </span></em><span>The questions were making her sick. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio!” Agatha’s voice shook her from her daze</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes, my love?” Rio replied reflexively </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are you going to sit back down or just stand there staring at nothing?” Agatha scoffed as she looked her up and down. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sorry, I was… I was just thinking.” Rio mumbled as she moved to join Agatha. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“About what?” Agatha asked, more engaged in finishing her salad than Rio’s answer. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio stuttered as she tried to piece together a thought that wouldn’t raise alarm bells. “That….um…that went well, don’t you think?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes, dear, that’s what I was just saying. I’m glad we did this.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah me too.” Rio said softly, staring at Agatha as if at any moment she could disintegrate before her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha frowned with an amused smile as she took in Rio’s concerned expression. “Why are you looking at me like that?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Like what?” Rio shook her head as she’d eyes grew wide with caution. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You look like a sad puppy.” Agatha chortled</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, I’m… just tired.” She tried to pry a reassuring smile from her lips. “Agatha…I love you.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I love you too, weirdo.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>————————————————</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Over the next few days Rio did all she could to distract her nagging thoughts. She poured herself into her work as Agatha returned to her hectic schedule of festival planning. She cleaned relentlessly, organizing each room of Agatha’s house, putting all of her energy towards preparing for the baby and the baby shower. Every moment they were together she hovered over Agatha, attending to her every whim, ensuring she was calm, relaxed and comfortable and wanted for nothing. All this in an effort to quell the anxieties that grew as the nightmares continued night after night. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>By the time Thursday rolled around, Agatha couldn’t help but notice this renewed effort as she stumbled upon Rio in the kitchen early that morning, elbow deep in the freezer, the contents of her pantry and fridge spread across every available surface.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Have you gotten </span><em><span>any </span></em><span>rest this week?” She asked, startling Rio who knocked her head on the shelf above her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“OUCH! Jeez you scared the shit out of me!” Rio groaned as she rubbed the sore spot at the back of her head. “Yeah, I’ve had a few hours here and there. I made breakfast. Have a seat, I’ll make you a plate.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s alright I can get it myself. You’ve been going non-stop the last few days. I’m worried if you keep this up you’re going to burn yourself out!” Agatha chided as she grabbed some food and settled into the stool at the counter. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re one to talk, not getting home until nearly 9 last night! Besides, I’m just trying to get things ready and make sure you both have what you need before he gets here.” Rio said as she resumed cleaning out the freezer.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I told you, this week and next are going to be demanding getting the final details to fall into place but as soon as we get through the first weekend things will ease up.” Agatha reiterated. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And you’ll take some time off?” Rio pressed as she furiously scrubbed the inside of the fridge. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I didn’t say that, but I will be back to a more normal schedule, I promise.” Agatha assured.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Uh-huh.” Rio grumbled, not quite buying that pledge</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio, take a break, come sit with me.” Agatha asked, beckoning her over.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m just finishing wiping everything down and then I have to put all this stuff back in before it spoils. You go ahead and eat.” Rio replied as she continued to rush around the kitchen.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio, sit.” Agatha demanded as she shot her a non-negotiable glare. Rio threw down her rag and reluctantly closed the freezer then padded over to sink into the chair next to Agatha. “What’s going on? You’ve been a little tightly wound this week.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What do you mean?” Rio asked as she grabbed herself a plate of food.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sweetheart, you’ve been working your crazy shifts at the hospital then you come home and you won’t let me lift a finger, even to grab a snack. You barely sleep, you’re up at all hours of the night cleaning this place from top to bottom. While I appreciate your doting nature you’ve taken it to another level. And don’t think I haven’t noticed the way you look at me, like I might fall apart at any minute. So again, I ask, what’s going on?” Agatha pressed as Rio avoided her gaze. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio let out a heavy breath as she stared down at her plate, thinking of how to respond to Agatha. She didn’t want to add any worries or concerns that would cause Agatha any stress, yet she knew Agatha would only continue to pry without some sort of explanation.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don’t know, I think it just hit me how little time there is left and there’s so much to get done. You have enough on your plate, too much in my opinion and I can’t deny, it bothers me. I know you don’t really have a choice so anything that I can take off your plate I will, to make sure you’re ok, both of you.” She explained as she picked at some breakfast potatoes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I appreciate that, my love, I really do, but seeing you like this, it is worrying. Yes, there’s a lot to get done and I admire that you’re willing to pick up the slack, but we have time, it doesn’t all need to happen right now. It’s more important to me that you take care of yourself too.” Agatha urged as she dug into her own meal.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio bit her lip as she shifted the food on her plate. “You’re right. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to worry you.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Of course I’m right! And you have nothing to be sorry about. It’s a selfish request on my part. I’ll need you at your best, well rested with a clear head when he arrives. If you keep this up you’ll be running on fumes and no good to either of us.” She reached over and hooked a finger under Rio’s chin and turned her face towards her. “I can’t do this without you.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio let out a nervous breath as her lips twitched into a smile. She wished she could just refocus and relax the way Agatha was urging her to, but every time she took a break or closed her eyes, the horrid visions and thoughts of Agatha in distress flooded her mind. And how could she tell her? How could she begin to explain the depth of the fear that was holding her hostage in her own mind? Doing so would only inspire panic and if she truly wanted to avoid these visions coming to fruition she had to do all she could to reassure her and set her mind at ease.</span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>“I know. You won’t have to, I promise. I’ll…take it easy.” Rio agreed, relenting to Agatha’s request. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You could always meditate.” Agatha quipped with a cheeky grin as she booped Rio on the nose.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Using my own advice against me I see!” Rio snorted as she took a bite of her food at last. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“If I have to do it, so do you! I’m told it can help with stress, and you, my dear, seem very stressed. Are you working today?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, I’m off through Saturday though I do have to start getting ready for your party.” Rio reminded with a smirk.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ugh, we’re still doing that?” Agatha groaned as she rolled her eyes.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes, my love, it’s happening.” Rio insisted</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well, if nothing else you should find something to do that has nothing to do with me or the baby, just for today. You’ll have plenty of time tomorrow to prepare.” Agatha instructed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“But…Agatha” Rio began in protest.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“But nothing! In fact, I’m banning you from the house, at least for the day. You can come home for dinner. Give me your key.” Agatha turned and held out her hand.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You can’t be serious!” Rio chuckled as she gave Agatha an disapproving glare.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Deadly serious, my love.” Agatha’s eyes flickered with a kind of warning certainty that let Rio know this was not up for debate. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She slid off the stool and went in search of her keys. “When is this supposed to start? I at least have to finish putting the kitchen back together before I leave.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You can stay until I have to leave for work, then go find something to do.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Like what?!” Rio groaned as she rifled through her bag.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don’t know! Go see a movie, go to a bookstore. Hell, see if Alice is up for one of your little games or something. Just give your mind a rest with all the baby stuff while you still can. You'll have plenty of time to worry about all of that when he’s here!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fine!” Rio grunted as she dropped the key into Agatha’s hand. “I guess I’ll see if Alice wants to join a pick up game later or something. I’ve been meaning to catch up with her anyway.” Rio sighed begrudgingly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Perfect! Now, I’m going to finish getting ready, you work on putting this place back together, I’m leaving in about 30 minutes.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes, dear.” Rio grumbled as she moved their plates to the sink. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Before she wandered down the hallway Agatha moved to stand behind Rio, her arms wrapping around her waist as best she could with her swollen belly squished between them and rested her chin on her shoulder. “You know that I love you, deeply, otherwise I wouldn’t be doing this.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I do.” Rio sighed as she let her head rest against Agatha’s. “I know if it were you I’d probably be telling you the same thing.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Good!” Agatha said as she pressed a kiss to Rio’s cheek, “I’m glad you understand.” She pried herself away and began to head down the hall just as Rio’s voice called out to her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha…”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes, my love?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio appeared around the corner holding a glass of water with a pill in the other hand, “Forget something?” she smirked as she raised a scolding eyebrow at her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ah…right. How could I forget?” Agatha grimaced as she quickly swallowed the pill and handed the glass back to Rio. “See! What would I do without you?” She said as she patted her cheek before waddling back down the hallway. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>—-------------------------------------------</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Half an hour later Rio was seated in Agatha’s driveway, utterly nauseated at the dismal thoughts running through her mind in the quiet stillness. Now, alone, in the silence of her car her fears screamed their persistent worries. </span><em><span>What if something happened to Agatha? To the baby? What if she wasn’t there when she needed her? What if she couldn’t save them? How could she live with herself if she lost either of them, or worse, both? </span></em><span>She shook her head and pressed her hands against her face. Even if there was something to be concerned about there was nothing she could do about it at the moment and there was no use wallowing in this self pity at something that was likely not to pass. She let out a frustrated growl as she released what tension she could before reaching for her phone. She quickly pulled up Alice’s contact and called her, putting the receiver on speaker. It rang a few times before Alice picked up.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Hey dude! What’s up?! I wasn’t sure if I was going to hear from you before Saturday or not.”</span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, it’s been pretty crazy around here. Any chance you’re free for a game today? I think I need to let off some steam.”</span></p><p> </p><p><em><span>“Yeah, I’m down. Jen’s at work and I don’t have anything until 4. I can meet you at your place in an hour?”</span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sounds like a plan, I’ll see you there.” Rio hung up the phone and flung it into the passenger’s seat beside her. She took a deep breath and started the car before finally peeling out of Agatha’s driveway. </span></p><p><br/><br/><br/></p><p><span>As she pulled into the parking lot she felt this odd sense of deja vu settle over her. This was her home that she was still paying rent for, but after the last few weeks of living with Agatha it felt more like she was a visitor returning to see an old friend. She pried herself from the car, slamming the door behind her and made her way into the vast entryway of the former school building. The sunlight gleamed through the opulent stained glass as she ascended the grand staircase, opting for the scenic route to her apartment. The colorful prisms gleamed along the walls and floors breaking her out of the cloud of grey that had been hovering over her these past few days. </span></p><p><span>The quiet, empty halls echoed with her footsteps as she continued down the hallway to her door. The familiar smells of antique wood and something sweet and cinnamony wafting out from a neighboring apartment welcomed her back. As she stood before her door, sunlight illuminating the frosted glass, she searched her bag for the ancient key to unlock it. She dug through a few pockets, shifted some contents to the floor and eventually located it, magnetized to the band of her smart watch that hadn’t been charged since she last stayed at her place. Just as she bent down and gathered the things she had thrown on the floor she heard footsteps approaching.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Vidal! Hey Vidal! What’s up?” called a husky, gruff voice from the other end of the hall.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey Marco! How’s it going man?” Rio replied to the towering, meat head in a cut off shirt and basketball shorts barreling towards her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Tell me you’re playing today! We got our asses handed to us on Monday!” He groaned as he greeted her with a high-five and a pat on the back. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, that’s the plan. Alice is coming back too.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That little speed demon? Awe hell yeah! She’s a ball of fire! Chad is going to lose his shit!” He snorted. “So what’s been going on with you? Haven’t seen you around the halls lately, they workin you too much at the hospital?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah work’s been busy. I’ve also been staying over at my girlfriend’s place.” Rio explained</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oooh, your </span><em><span>girlfriend’s </span></em><span>place.” His voice lilted in that singsongy taunting tone. “Things are getting pretty serious then?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Heh, I’d say so.” Rio replied as she brought up a hand to rub at the back of her neck as a flutter of nerves washed over her. “We’re…uh…we’re actually having a baby in a little over a month.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh shit!” Marco’s eyes nearly flew out of his head in shock. “Yeah that’s..uh…that’s about as serious as you can get. Damn, does that mean you’re moving out on us?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I mean, yeah, eventually. I guess sooner rather than later. My lease is up at the end of June so we’ll probably make it official then.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Man, I hate to see you go! But, hey, congratulations! That's super exciting!” He cheered before a concerned realization struck him. “You’ll still play with us though right?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I think I’ve got a few more games in me before I’m out for the season.” Rio reasoned</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And you’ll come back next year? Once things settle?” he half begged.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“If I can make it happen I will.” She chuckled at his enthusiasm. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Excellent!” He cheered as he pumped his fist. “Don’t want to lose our best player!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Please I’m hardly your best.” Rio scoffed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t sell yourself short! You got most of these guys dripping sweating up and down the court trying to keep up with you. Well, glad you’re back today at least. I’m gonna head down and get warmed up before Chad gets his sweaty hands on all the balls. See you down there!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah man, see you down there!” Rio waved him off as she slid her key into the lock and pushed her way through into her apartment. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>At this point it had been over a month since she had slept here and it was </span><em><span>apparent</span></em><span>. The earthy amber fragrance she had cultivated was hidden under a layer of musty staleness. Her plants had been regretfully neglected, many of which long since withered and died though a few were still holding on for dear life. She plopped her bag on the counter and went to inspect the fridge. As soon as she cracked the door she was met with several pungent odors competing to make her gag. She quickly closed it and moved to grab the trash can and drag it close. She inhaled deeply and held her breath as she reopened the door and scraped the minimal contents of her fridge into the trash. She quickly tied the bag shut and hauled it over her shoulder to immediately take down to the dumpster outside. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The journey down was longer than she remembered, particularly so with the stench that lingered behind every step. With a grunt and a heave she disposed of the trash then made her way back to the main entryway to head down the hall and check her mail. As she approached the locker she could see bits of paper sticking out of the slats and she kicked herself for not thinking to check sooner. She twisted the knob until the lock clicked and cautiously cracked the door. All at once a waterfall of envelopes and fliers poured out onto the floor around her. She closed her eyes and let out a deep irritated sigh before bending down to gather what was essentially a pile of trash. As she struggled to collect everything she heard a pair of feet rushing towards her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Need any help?” Offered a kind and somewhat familiar voice </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No…I think I got it, thanks though.” Rio replied as she dropped a handful of letters, not really looking at the person standing right in front of her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You sure about that?” The person giggled as they bent down to help. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>As Rio grabbed the pile of mailers the person had picked up she gasped in shock. “Yelena! What the hell are you doing here?” She shrieked, immediately dropping everything she had collected to tackle her in a hug. “I didn’t think you would get here until tomorrow! Is Nat with you? ” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey! It’s good to see you too!” Yelena laughed. “No, Nat’s still coming tomorrow night with Hela. My schedule got switched around so I was free and figured I’d head up early, see if you needed any help before the party on Saturday. I was hoping to surprise you!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re sure fucking did! How’d you know I was here?” She asked as her forehead wrinkled in confusion.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“To be fair, I had no idea where you were. I did try and check at the hospital first, obviously you weren’t there so I came to check here and caught you swimming in mail. What happened?” She asked as she started picking up envelopes again. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hate to say it’s been a minute since I checked the mail.” Rio explained</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You don’t say.” Yelena scoffed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey! I’ve been busy and I’m not really here too often these days.” Rio retorted</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Why am I not surprised? Sounds like things are going well.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio didn’t reply immediately, caught up in the memory of the previous days. “Yeah…yeah for sure! Really well.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Uh-oh”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That sounded less than convincing.” Yelena replied skeptically.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, really everything’s fine, it’s great…it’s just…”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“RIO!” Alice belted from the entryway.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey Alice! You made it!” Rio called back as she stood to greet her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What the hell? Did you rob the mailman or something?” Alice chortled as she got closer and could see the mayhem that had ensued.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, it’s just been a few days.” Alice exchanged a doubtful glance with Yelena. “Ok, maybe a few weeks.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Need any help?” Alice offered</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I think there are a couple packages in the locker, if you wouldn’t mind grabbing those and we can all head up. Alice, this is Yelena by the way, one of my friends from Boston, she’s come up for the party. Yelena, this is Alice, one of Agatha’s friends.” Rio explained as she scooped up the last of the papers from the floor.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh yeah! You were at the bar that night we came to visit. You were with that woman in the pink suit, right? Nice to finally meet you.” Yelena said as she reached out a hand to Alice.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That was Jen, Agatha’s friend from college. Alice actually owns the bar that we were at.” Rio explained as she led them back up to her apartment. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No kidding! Well we had a great time, would definitely go back!” Yelena insisted. “What are you two up to this morning?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio had invited me over for a pick up game in the gym. You’ll be joining us right? They need all the help they can get!” Alice chuckled</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“OOO, I don’t know about that!” Yelena cringed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Come on, it’ll be fun! No one really takes it seriously, just friendly competition.” Rio insisted</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Eh, you know basketball isn’t really my sport. I wouldn’t say I have an advantage.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’d be surprised. The guys might have us on height but most of them could barely run a mile. I run circles around them. And then of course they never expect anyone to pass you the ball so I scored half the points last time.” Alice explained</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’ll consider it. I wasn’t really planning on chasing any balls today.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio snorted in laughter as they approached her door. “Sorry if my place is a bit messy. Like I said, it’s been a minute since I’ve been back.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It can’t be that bad! You’ve been to my place.” Yelena scoffed.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fair enough, just know I warned you.” Rio cautioned as she opened the door letting the musty amber smell greet them. “You can just throw the mail and boxes on the counter, I’ll sort through it later.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“When you said your place was a mess I was expecting it to be a lot worse.” Alice chuckled as she set the packages down. “Is there a bit of a smell? Sure, but nothing a few cracked windows and some air circulation can’t fix.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You really haven’t been here!” Yelena gasped as she inspected a particularly shriveled plant. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen you kill a plant.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I know, I’ve only been by a few times to quickly grab clothes and things and that was still weeks ago. What can I say, my priorities have shifted a bit.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I would hope so! What is it? You have like a month left?” Yelena asked</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hopefully…at least a month.” Rio grumbled as she put a new bag in the trashcan. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She’s not due until June right? You have plenty of time!” Alice reassured</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How far along are you on baby prepping?” Yelena asked</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“To be honest I’ve been stress cleaning all week. It feels like we have nothing together. Agatha is swamped with getting ready for the festival and is already doing more than she should, which is driving me crazy, so I’m trying to fill in the gaps. The baby’s room is stuffed with shipping boxes and shopping bags, I haven’t had a chance to touch anything in there.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You still want to set that up on Saturday morning before the party?” Alice asked</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s the plan, if you’re still up for it.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Of course!” Alice exclaimed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Is Jen still good to take her out and keep her occupied?” Rio asked</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh yes, she’s got a whole plan now. I think she’s actually excited about it.” Alice said as she opened a few windows.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sweet, that’s going to make this all so much easier!” Rio sighed in relief.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I know you had asked Nat and I to pick up the food, but if you need any other help I’m here.” Yelena offered</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh I’m definitely going to need your help! There’s a lot more to pull together than I initially thought, and of course we’ll still have to set up for the actual party. We’ll just have Nat and Hela pick up the food.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Jeez! I’m glad I came early. Were you really going to try and set everything up just the two of you?” Yelena exclaimed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well, Lilia agreed to help with the party set up but yeah, I’m going to need more hands.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh nice! Your aunt’s coming? I take it you three had a chance to chat and work things out?” Alice asked</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Work things out? What happened with Lilia?” Yelena asked</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I told you she was the one who figured out Agatha was pregnant in the first place. The pregnancy tests and everything.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, right.” Yelena replied, her eyes flashing as she remembered the details.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Things have been understandably awkward since then but Agatha, surprisingly, agreed to sit down and talk things over with her. Try and start fresh, ya know.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And it went well?” Alice asked</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Better than I expected! Agatha even admitted she liked her, so she’s coming to the party.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Good! I’m glad it went well! You two deserve to have </span><em><span>some </span></em><span>sort of stable family in your lives.” Alice said as she plopped down on the couch. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, I wouldn’t consider Lilia stable by any means but she does care about us. I know she’ll be there for whatever we need, and she’s certainly going to spoil the shit out of this kid!” Rio cracked a smile at the thought but her mind quickly returned to the look Lilia had given her right before she had left. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You doing ok otherwise?” Yelena asked, seeing the flash of concern dance across her face. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, I’m fine. Totally fine, just a little overwhelmed with it all.” Rio hurried to explain, brushing off Yelena’s worry.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’d be concerned if you weren’t!” Alice shouted from the couch “You know what might help with that?” She said, popping up to look over the back of the sofa.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What?” Rio chuckled</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Kicking some ass on the court!” Alice insisted, pointing a determined finger in her direction.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio let out a breathy laugh, “You are too right. Let me go get changed. Yelena, you playing?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Not in this!” She gestured to her outfit of a grey sweater and jeans with a pair of doc martins. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Obviously. Come on, I’ll find you something to wear.” Rio insisted as she turned Yelena around and pushed her down the hall towards her bedroom.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>As soon as the door closed behind them Yelena flopped back onto the bed while Rio rifled through the doors. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So, what’s really going on?” Yelena probed as she tucked her arms beneath her head and stared pointedly at Rio. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio didn’t glance back but could feel her gaze boring into her. “Nothing, I’m fine. Like I said, I’m just tired and a little overwhelmed.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Eh, I’m not buying it.” Yelena retorted</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Not buying what?” Rio feigned ignorance and continued to dig about her room, doing her best to dismiss Yelena’s concern. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Please, we survived medical school together. I’ve seen you exhausted and way more overwhelmed than this! This is different. You look worried.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Worried?” The bluntness with which Yelena had seen her sent a bolt of panic down Rio’s spine. “Why…why would I be worried?” She stuttered, trying and failing to uphold her nonchalance. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don’t know, you tell me.” Yelena sat up, her gaze now burning a hold through Rio’s soul as she leaned forward onto her elbows in full interrogation mode. “Out with it Vidal!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio chewed at the side of her mouth as she considered what was actually bothering her. She and Agatha were in a good place. They had overcome so much and were finally in a position to enjoy this exciting new life on the horizon, but something was gnawing at her. Though she had tried to brush it off and occupy her mind with preparing for the baby, she couldn’t help but acknowledge the real fear that was plaguing her and growing by the night. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m…afraid.” She closed her eyes, letting the weight of her admission settle.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>They sat for a moment in silence before Yelena asked, “Afraid of what?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha’s been having trouble with high blood pressure. She’s dealing with a lot, too much really. The doctor finally put her on some medication to help manage it and I thought things would calm down after we dealt with the whole court thing, but she still has spikes here and there. We’re getting closer and she’s just doing way too much.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It makes sense why you would be concerned. That’s not something you really want to take lightly. Have you two talked about it?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Not exactly. After the appointment I suggested maybe she take a step back at work, do what she can from home, give herself a break before the baby is born. But she wouldn’t hear of it, not with the festival coming up. She’s putting a lot of pressure on herself and I’m afraid it might make things worse.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ugh, that’s not good! No wonder you’re spiraling about it. It sounds like you might want to try and have another conversation.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’ve tried but I’m afraid if I push it too much more she’s just going to work harder out of spite, to prove that she can do it. She’s tough and determined to see this festival through to the end but I’m worried it’s going to break her! I…I don’t know what I’d do if she…If something happened…” Rio was practically chewing a hole through her cheek trying to keep from crying as her eyes quickly flooded with tears. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Yelena pushed herself from the bed and moved to pull Rio into a hug. “Hey! It’s going to be ok! I’m sure she’ll be perfectly fine, they both will, they’re in great hands! Besides, you know they’ll just put her on bedrest if the medication really isn’t working. It’s too much of a risk not to.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I know, and I’m afraid she’s going to lose it if they do that before the festival!” Rio groaned</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Maybe, but she wouldn’t really have a choice, that shit can be life or death.” Yelena reminded her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, believe me, I’m well aware. For now I’m just trying to hold everything together, make sure she has what she needs, get the house together, try and get her to relax as much as possible. It’s been exhausting!” Rio sighed as she flopped onto the bed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You need to be careful or you’re going to wear yourself down before this baby comes!” Yelena warned as she settled down next to her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha was saying something similar this morning.” Rio laughed as she began to wipe away the few tears that had managed to fall. “She actually kicked me out of the house for the day because she wanted me to chill. She said </span><em><span>I</span></em><span> was too wound up because I’d been cleaning her house within an inch of its life trying to manage my stress about everything.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“See! It sounds like both of you need a break! Really you guys should do like a baby moon or something.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“A what?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“A baby moon. You know, like a honeymoon? Take a trip or a few days off at least before the baby is born. Enjoy the last bit of freedom you have before your life is nothing but sleepless nights and diaper changes.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Heh, that’s going to take some convincing, but it’s not a bad idea. Maybe for a day or two once the festival is underway, then she’ll have no choice but to relax!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Just then Alice burst through the door. “Oh come on! You guys haven’t even changed yet! What have you been doing this whole time?” Alice looked quickly back and forth between them. “You two weren’t hooking up in here were you?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ugh! Absolutely not!” “Ha! Hell no!” They protested in unison.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Phew! Not going to lie, I was worried for a second. That would have been a </span><em><span>disaster!</span></em><span> So we still doing this or have plans changed? I’m down for whatever.” Alice shrugged.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, no, we’re still doing this! I can’t wait to see the look on Chad’s face when the three of us walk in at the last minute.” Rio chuckled</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Then you two better get it together, we’ve only got like 5 minutes.” Alice warned as she turned to head back into the kitchen.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Thanks.” Rio muttered as she threw Yelena an outfit.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“For what?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“For coming up to help out. For helping me talk things over. I really appreciate it.” Rio explained as she slipped on a pair of gym shoes.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You know I’m here for you any time man! It’s all going to work out. She’s going to be fine. The baby is going to be fine. Just try and give yourself a break, ok? Let yourself be excited.” Yelena urged</span></p><p> </p><p><span> “You’re right. I’ve just got to get out of my own head about it. This should help.” She smirked as she helped Yelena to her feet.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What’s that?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Kicking Chad’s ass.” Rio chortled</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Who’s Chad?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“He’s a douche. Don’t worry, you’ll know him when you see him.” Rio scoffed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“He sounds delightful. You think we can make him cry?” Yelena chuckled</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Gods that would just make my day! If we can make him cry I’m buying everyone lunch!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I think I just got excited about this game.” Yelena snorted</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alice!” Rio called as she and Yelena made it out to the kitchen. “New goal, we’re gonna try and make Chad cry.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And it will be music to my ears! Damn, I fucking hate that guy!” Alice laughed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t we all! You ready to do this?” Rio asked as she grabbed each of them a water bottle.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Let’s go!!!” Alice shouted as she ushered them out the door.</span></p><p><br/><br/><br/></p><p><span>As the three of them entered the school gym Marco made his way over to greet them. “Damn dude! Cutting it close! You had me worried for a minute that you were going to flake!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, no, just had to get the whole team assembled. You remember Alice,”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sup Marco!” Alice beamed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And this is my friend Yelena from Boston.” Rio said, nodding her head in Yelena’s direction.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey, nice to meet you!” Yelena smiled and waved. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Likewise! I’m glad you brought reinforcements. Brian is out with “knee pain” so we’ll need all the help we can get. Chad is on one today, he’s already driving me up a wall.” The four of them looked over to spot an average height balding man with a sizable gut peeking out of his cut off t-shirt. He wore a handlebar mustache and sported sweatbands on his head and wrists, knee braces on both knees, and sports goggles strapped to his head. He was over at the other end of the court loudly criticizing his teammates' form as they threw some practice shots. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh I see what you mean. He looks like a total douche.” Yelena grumbled, getting a chuckle out of Marco. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, I think I’m gonna like her! If you guys wanna get some practice shots in, I'd shoot a few now, we’re gonna get started here in a couple minutes.” He said as he handed over the ball he had been carrying. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>They made their way to the nearest hoop and began taking turns throwing shots and warming up. Almost instantly their practice was interrupted by a nauseating drone as Chad slid down to their side of the court. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well, well, well! Look who decided to show up today! I figured after last week you would have realized that you’re out of your league.” He said in a smarmy tone</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Bro, it’s a pick up game, there are no leagues.” Alice scoffed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That may be, but still, the win just isn’t as satisfying when you’re playing against a bunch of girls. I mean, come on, it’s inevitable.” He chortled</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Girls? Bitch, I’m 35!” Yelena snarled</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Buzz off Chad! You know as well as I do that we can beat you with our eyes closed. Last week was a fluke, I had a lot going on.” Rio growled as she sunk another practice shot.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“A fluke?” He snorted “</span><em><span>Right</span></em><span>, blame your period or whatever, just know you have no chance and might as well go braid each other's hair or something.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio narrowed her eyes and marched up to stand toe to toe with Chad. “Believe what you want to, just don’t act shocked when you’re sweating bullets and barely able to breathe because we’re running circles around you again.” She finished with a smirk. “See you on the court, </span><em><span>Chad</span></em><span>.”  She said as she shoved the ball she was holding into his gut and led the other two to the benches where Marco was waiting. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ugh, you were right, he is particularly insufferable today!” Rio groaned as she stuck out her tongue in disgust. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I know! After last week and Monday his ego has fucking ballooned.” Marco said, rolling his eyes in annoyance. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m surprised he can walk with how big his head is!” Alice chuckled</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“We doing this thing or are y’all just going to stand there with your thumbs up your asses? Let’s go!” Chad hollered from the other end of the court. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Dude, chill! We’re waiting for Darren to get back from the bathroom then we’re ready to go!” Marco shouted back. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck, I can’t wait to wipe that stupid smirk off his face!” Yelena growled. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Glad to see you’re getting into it!” Alice chuckled as she patted Yelena on the shoulder. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Nothing gets me fired up quite like putting an asshole in his place!” Yelena huffed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Damn man, took you long enough!” Marco chided as Darren, a tall slender man with dark curly hair, a shirt that was almost too big and shorts that were almost too small, jogged over from the locker room. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sorry man! I had business to take care of! We ready to do this? Whose tipping off?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m happy to start. Maybe it’ll lull him into a false sense of security.” Marco offered</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Heh, one can only hope!” Rio snickered as they all made their way onto the court. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Finally! I thought we were gonna have to take the win on default since y’all can’t seem to get your shit together.” Chad guffawed as he sidled up to center court to face Marco. “What? We’re none of you ladies brave enough to tip off against me?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Shut the fuck up and let’s play!” Marco said as he bounced the ball to Chad which he returned to start the game. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Marco dribbled the ball down the court with Rio and Alice flanking him on either side. Yelena and Darren followed closely behind while Chad did his best to block and steal the ball. As they neared the basket Marco faked veering left and snuck around Chad to pass the ball to Alice who immediately passed to Yelena to sink the first basket. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Just a bunch of girls huh?” Rio taunted as she passed Chad on the way to guard one of his teammates. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Lucky shot!” He growled as he chucked the ball at an open teammate. They all barreled down to the other end of the court, all the while Chad was dictating the moves his teammates should throw. As they neared the other basket they made an attempt to throw the ball to Chad who fumbled it, giving Darren a chance to steal. As they husseled to the other end of the court Chad berated them for the terrible throw and he positioned himself in front of Darren who managed to sneak a pass to Rio who took the shot. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Better get your team together Chad they’re looking a little slow!” Alice shouted as she backed up to defend. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Chad’s face grew red with embarrassment and rage, “Enjoy it now, girlypop, that’s the last one y’all are gonna get!” He shouted back as he launched the ball viciously at another teammate. Now, more determined than ever, Chad rushed to the other end of the court and begged to be passed the ball. Reluctantly his teammate passed him the ball and he was able to score the first shot for his team. “Haha! Suck on that” he gloated as me moved to guard Darren. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Marco stepped out and threw the ball to Alice who bolted to the other end of the court with Chad’s teammate struggling to keep up. Just as she positioned herself to take the shot Chad appeared before the hoop with a furious determination in his eye. “Not this time princess!” he growled as he blocked nearly every vantage point with his massive form. Suddenly out of the corner of her eye, Alice caught a glimpse of Yelena open. She charged forward as if she was ready to shoot and as she jumped she threw the ball to Yelena instead who made the shot. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s what I’m talking about!” Marco shouted, clapping with joy as he jogged over to give each of them a high five. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Chad shook with rage as he stormed over to berate his teammate about his poor defense. “Where the hell were you? She’s like 5 feet tall, you should have had that! Get it the fuck together Mark!” He shouted before storming off to grab the ball. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Gotta get your head in the game man! You’re four points behind!” Rio chuckled as she moved to guard Mike. Chad shot her a scathing glare as he launched the ball to his teammate and hustled down the court. They passed the ball back and forth between them, narrowly missing a steal from Darren before making a 2 point shot. “Good shot Tom, good shot!” Chad called as he positioned himself in front of Rio. “Only two points now bitch! Enjoy your lead while it lasts.” </span></p><p><span>Rio scoffed but said nothing as she raced down the court. Darren had the ball and shot it to Yelena who passed it over to Marco. He tried his best to shuffle around Tom who eventually stole the ball and bolted for the other end of the court though Alice was right on his heals. He tried to dodge around her to make the basket but she was relentless and held him off until the rest of the team had made it to their end of the court. Eventually he managed to pass around her to Chad who quickly sunk another 2 points. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Good hustle Alice, we’ll get ‘em next time!” Darren called out as he grabbed the ball.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fat chance!” Chad snickered as he highfived Tom. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright, last round then we’re taking a break!” Marco called as he grabbed the ball.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ohhh, y’all getting tired already? We’re just getting started!” Chad pouted tauntingly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Marco rolled his eyes then launched the ball to Alice who rushed it to the other end of the court. She quickly passed it to Darren who was caught up by Tom so he threw it to Rio who was wide open. She positioned herself for a clear 2 point shot and just as she jumped to launch the ball she was pummeled by Chad who threw her off balance on the landing and she crumpled to the floor. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Not cool man!” Marco yelled as he pushed Chad out of the way. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Woah, Rio! Are you ok?” Yelena shouted as she and Alice rushed to her side. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio sat up slowly. She could feel her elbow throbbing where it had hit the gym floor, but that was nothing compared to the pain in her knee. She stretched it out slowly but could already feel it starting to swell. “Yeah, I think I’m fine” She replied, not wanting to let on how much pain she was in. She reached a hand up to let Yelena pull her to her feet but just as she put weight on her right leg she yelped in pain as her knee gave way beneath her and Yelena and Marco quickly grabbed her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That doesn’t sound fine!” Alice chided as they guided her to a nearby bench. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You really couldn’t help yourself could you!” Darren scolded Chad as the rest of them followed to see how she was.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I told her she had no business playing! This is the kind of shit that happens so if you can’t handle it then stay off the court.” Chad replied defensively</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Asshole, you fouled her! The same thing would have happened to me if your fat body had slammed into me like that!”  Darren yelled back. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How’s it looking?” Chad asked as Yelena inspected the injury. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“There’s already some swelling and she can’t walk. It’s not looking good.” She replied as she pressed on Rio’s knee. “Does that hurt?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio bit her lip as she winced in pain. “NO, no, not at all.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Yelena glared at her skeptically. “We need to take you to the hospital.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Come on! I’m sure it’ll be fine if we get some ice on it. It’s nothing.” Rio brushed it off and slowly moved her foot to the ground before trying and failing to stand again.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio! You probably tore something. We need to go get it checked out!” Yelena scolded </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ugh, you’re not going to let this go are you?” Rio groaned</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Heh, absolutely not!” She confirmed as she tucked herself under Rio’s arm and helped her to her good leg. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’ll go pull my car around and meet you at this side door.” Alice said as she rushed out of the gym.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well I guess that’s game then!” Marco sighed as he slid around to support Rio’s other side. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Seriously! You guys are forfeiting?” Chad groaned</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Forfeit what? We won, she made the shot.” Darren chuckled.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No fucking way! You can’t claim that as a win!” Chad shouted, his face turning redder than a beet. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Face it, we won fair and square. Maybe if you hadn’t body checked her you would’ve had a chance at a comeback but too late for that now.” Darren chuckled</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“NO! Y’all are just making up excuses now! That’s a forfeit! We still have the winning streak!” Chad protested</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You can tell yourself that if it’ll make you feel better but we all know the truth. You lost to a bunch of girls, again.” Rio sneered as they passed by Chad on their way out the door.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I didn’t lose! We didn’t lose!” She could hear him shouting frantically as the door closed behind them.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>With Alice already waiting for them, Yelena and Marco helped Rio into the back of her car before Yelena joined them in the front passenger seat. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You gonna be alright Vidal?” Marco asked as she adjusted to get comfortable.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh yeah, I’ll be fine. I’m sure it’s nothing and you’ll see me back next week.” She reassured as Yelena and Alice turned to glare at her disapprovingly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright! If you get the all clear I’m holding you to it!” He chuckled as he shut the door. “Mind if I give you my number so you can let me know how she’s really doing?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, of course!” Alice said as she handed her phone out the window. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Do you want me to call Agatha and have her meet us there?” Yelena offered</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No!” Rio shouted “Absolutely not! This is the last thing she needs to be thinking about! We’ll figure out what’s going on and I’ll tell her this evening when I get home.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright! Just thought I’d ask.” Yelena said as she threw up her hands in surrender. </span></p><p><br/><span>As they pulled away Rio sank further into the back seat and pressed her hands to her face. The pain in her knee was beginning to throb and grow hot with inflammation. She was furious with herself. </span><em><span>How could she have let this happen? </span></em><span>Agatha, when she did find out, would likely be irate and this was only going to cause more stress. For now all she could do was hope that it wasn’t as bad as it felt. </span></p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p><span>Agatha burst into her office again after another long and grueling day of festival planning. They were coming down to the wire with barely a week left and it felt like they had nothing together. The sets and art installations were still in pieces. Vendors had been calling and emailing her all day with stupid questions she had answered numerous times. The management company had been a huge help but they still needed her signature and approval every time they had to make an adjustment or add on to their existing plans. </span></p><p><span>If that wasn’t enough her body was protesting the strenuous activity more and more each day. Her feet had swollen nearly beyond recognition to where she was only able to squeeze them into a certain pair of uncomfortable shoes. Her back and hips ached constantly with the added pressures of her growing son who stretched and pressed relentlessly on his ever more constricting enclosure. And then of course there were the false contractions which, just like Jen had warned, became more and more frequent. Sometimes they were a nuisance and other times they were down right debilitating. It all felt like too much and not enough and it was beginning to take a toll. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>As she closed the door behind her she strode over to collapse into her desk chair just as a particularly nasty false contraction washed over her. She rested her head against the back of the chair and closed her eyes as she breathed slowly and waited for it to pass. As the muscles began to release she guided her hand along the surface of her swollen belly, feeling her son shift under the release in pressure. </span></p><p><span>“Sorry little bug! That was a rough one. You doing ok in there?” As she shifted her hand she felt a resounding kick just above her naval. “I know, but I’m afraid it’s only going to get worse before it gets better. You still have another month in there at least!” </span><em><span>Gods, how could she survive another month of this? </span></em></p><p><span>The only way this could possibly be bearable was Rio. The care she had shown, taking on everything around the house, keeping her fed, helping with her medication, and easing her discomforts as much as she possibly could. She was perfect and exactly what Agatha had needed, what they both needed, and she couldn’t help but wonder how her day had progressed since getting kicked out of the house that morning. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She sat up slowly and reached for her phone for the first time since lunch, expecting to see a barrage of texts and missed phone calls, but as the screen illuminated it showed nothing but a few emails and random app notifications. </span><em><span>Odd. </span></em><span>Sure she had said to focus on anything but her and the baby for the day but she didn’t really expect radio silence. She frowned as she shot her a text. </span></p><p> </p><p><em><span>I’m wrapping up for the day my love. You’re free to return home whenever. I’m excited to hear how your day went. </span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>With that sent she gathered her things as quickly as she could and headed for the door clutching a few contracts she intended to pass off to Sharon on her way out. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, are you headed home, dear?” Sharon said with that ever present sweetness to her voice. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes. Can you get these to the management company before you go? They’ll need to enter them into their system before tomorrow so I want to make sure they have what they need.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Of course dear. Anything else I can help you with?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She quickly checked her phone, expecting the usual immediate response from Rio but again there was nothing. “Actually yes. Did Rio happen to stop by or call you today?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No dear, I haven't heard from her. Why is everything ok?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh yes, I’m sure everything’s fine. She’s been tightly wound lately and I told her to take a day for herself. I just, I hadn’t heard anything from her so it must have been a good day I guess.” She shrugged though her face betrayed the concern she really had. “I’m sure she’s just out and about. She’s always up to something!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m sure you’re right, dear!” Sharon replied with a comforting smile. “I’ll get the contracts taken care of, you head home and get some rest, you’ll need it before the walkthrough tomorrow.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Tomorrow? I thought Herb had planned that for Monday.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh yes dear. It’s tomorrow and Monday. Tomorrow is for everything inside the hall, Monday is for the art installations, rear stage set up, and mural planning.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, lovely!” Agatha bit sarcastically “And what time does it start tomorrow? I’m supposed to have an appointment in the morning.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh I let him know, he was able to plan around it. It’s not scheduled until 10:30.” Sharon explained gleefully. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well, thank you for that. I should be in by 10 at the latest but I’ll let you know if that changes.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sounds good, dear! Say hi to Rio for me!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ok, see you tomorrow!” She waved to Sharon and then headed down to her car in the garage. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>After struggling to get situated, she checked her phone one last time for any sort of response from Rio but was met yet again with silence. She considered for a moment giving her a call but she was so exhausted she figured she could wait the 20 minutes it took to get home before ringing her. Besides, surely by then she’d have sent a reply. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>On the silent journey home she normally would have been running through her day in her mind, making a mental checklist of all she still had to follow up on. But as each minute passed she grew more and more concerned for Rio. This really wasn’t like her. Even when she worked at the hospital she was quick to respond. Or if she was going to be unavailable and in surgery she would send her a message and let her know ahead of time. </span><em><span>Why hadn’t she called or at least let her know where she was? Was she in trouble? Had something happened? </span></em><span>She quickly shook that thought from her mind. No, no, surely everything was fine. More than likely she had found a way to sneak back into the house and just didn’t want Agatha to know. She’d probably open the door and Rio would be there with dinner ready as a surprise. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>As she turned into her driveway these reassuring thoughts quickly vanished when Rio’s car was nowhere in sight. As she turned off her vehicle she could feel a cold pang of worry prickle down her spine. She reached for her phone again and, seeing it void of notifications, at last called Rio. The phone rang about five times before the voicemail picked up. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Hey, its Rio. You know how this works.”</span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>BEEP</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey hon! I…uh…I just got home. Haven’t heard from you. Hope everything’s ok. Let me know where you’re at and when you’re planning to get back. Love you, see you soon.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She hung up the phone and stared at the blank screen as she sat in a nervous silence. </span><em><span>She’s fine. Everything’s fine. Right?</span></em><span> She bit her lip as she gathered her things and struggled to keep her mind from spiraling. </span><em><span>What if something did happen? How would she know? Who would even call her? NO! </span></em><span>She shook her head hard as she opened the door to her car. She wasn’t going to go there. Rio was probably out somewhere seeing a movie or more than likely shopping for the baby. She wasn’t going to worry herself just yet. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She hoisted herself out of the vehicle and wandered up to her door. As she fumbled with the keys her mind couldn’t help but ponder on what Rio could be up to. </span><em><span>Had she gone swimming and just wasn’t near her phone? Was she at the movies or rock climbing or something? </span></em><span>She pushed her way into the empty dimly lit house. There was no music playing, no delicious smells wafting from the kitchen. Clearly Rio hadn’t snuck back in. </span><em><span>Where was she?!</span></em><span> As she stepped inside Scratchy chirped and ran to greet her, clearly relieved to have her home, and probably more so relieved that he wouldn’t have to go hunting for his next meal. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She closed the door behind her and threw her bag down on the kitchen table. She waddled over to a stool and struggled to remove her shoes, barely able to bend over far enough to do so. She really wished Rio had been here to help her with this and was seriously regretting having thrown her out this morning. With her aching feet now somewhat relieved having been sprung from their prison, she eased her way over to inspect the fridge. Rio had done too good of a job cleaning up. There were hardly any leftovers and most of the ingredients needed to be made into something and she was in no mood to attempt to cook. She grabbed a box of dates and fished out a package of nuts and set them on the counter to nibble on as she fetched food for Scratchy. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>With the beast satiated she grabbed what was left of her snack and headed to the bedroom to change into more comfortable clothes. As she began to strip she removed her phone from her pocket and threw it onto the bed. She held her breath as the Home Screen illuminated but there was still no sign of Rio. She slipped as quickly as she could into joggers and a large T-shirt and picked up the phone to call Rio again. </span></p><p><span>The phone rang, and rang, and </span><em><span>rang. </span></em></p><p> </p><p><em><span>“Hey it’s Rio. You know how this works.” </span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>BEEP</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio, sweetheart, it’s nearing dinner time. I’d love for you to come home! I’m thinking of ordering in, maybe Indian food? You certainly don’t want me cooking again. I’m going to place the order when I hang up and it should be here within 45 mins. I better see you or hear from you before then. Love you!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She hung up and stared at her phone again, begging for it to ring with a call from Rio. Nothing. Silence. She let out a huff of frustration and disappointment and marched out to the kitchen to snatch the menu to the local Indian restaurant off the fridge. She angrily and hungrily chose an assortment of items and called and placed an order for delivery. She had given herself 45 minutes before she could rightfully begin to lose her mind. In the meantime she did what she could to distract herself. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She decided to take a page out of Ralph’s book and flipped on Real Housewives of Salt Lake City, figuring watching someone else’s drama might distract her from her own. She grabbed her phone and set it on the coffee table just in case Rio did call, and then slid onto the floor as best she could to stretch out a bit. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>One episode bled into another and before long there was a knock at the door. She quickly paused the show and heaved herself from the floor as she hurried to the door. She took a breath as her hand gripped the door handle and she swung the door open. Immediately her heart sank. She had half expected Rio but instead was met by a 20 something stoner whose arms were filled with the three bags of food she had managed to order. She took the food from him, slamming the door closed behind her and rushed to set the food on the counter. She immediately abandoned the meal and hurried to check her phone. </span></p><p> </p><p><em><span>Nothing. </span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>Something was up. Something was clearly up. She had to figure out something to do. Maybe if she rang Lilia she would have an idea of where Rio was. She searched her phone for Lilia’s number and gave her a call. After the third ring she heard the phone pick up. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>You’ve called Calderu! If you’re trying to buy my home or calling about some sort of insurance you can hang up now.”</span></em></p><p> </p><p><em><span>“</span></em><span>Hey, Lilia, it’s Agatha.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Agatha! Doll! How’s it going hon?</span></em><span>”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Um…alright. Have…have you seen or heard from Rio today?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>No, dear, can’t say I have. Is everything alright?” </span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m sure it is. It’s just, I haven’t heard from her since this morning.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh no, did something happen? Did you two get into a tiff?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, not that at all. I told her she needed to take a break. Take a day for herself. I did, technically, kick her out of the house but I told her to come back for dinner. She hasn’t tried to call you or anything?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>No, not today. She’s probably off getting things for the party or somewhere watching a game. I…uh…I wouldn’t worry too much. Though do give me a call back if you don’t hear from her soon!</span></em><span>” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“A game! Right. Thanks Lilia, I'll let you know when I talk to her.” Agatha quickly hung up as the comment had sparked something in her memory. Maybe she had met up with Alice for a game! She searched her phone for Alice’s contact info and found nothing. She growled begrudgingly at herself for not getting Alice’s number at any point in their acquaintanceship and shifted to call Jen. </span></p><p><span>She began to pace in and out of rooms as the phone rang twice before she heard Jen on the other end. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>If you’re calling to ask me a gross question just know 1) you have 5 minutes and 2) if you’re not in labor we can talk about it on Saturday.</span></em><span>”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s not about any of that, Jennifer!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Well, my break’s almost over so you still only have 5 minutes.</span></em><span>” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Whatever! Did Alice meet up with Rio today?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>How should I know?</span></em><span>”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Isn’t she your girlfriend?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Yeah but it’s not like I have her on a leash… most of the time.</span></em><span>” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I did not need to know that! Look, I’m trying to find Rio, I haven’t heard from her all day and I need to see if Alice ended up with her at any point or might know where she’s at.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>And you called me, why?</span></em><span>” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don’t have her number, obviously!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>How?! We’ve been together for like almost a year! We all hang out all the time! How do you not have her number by now?</span></em><span>”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don’t know! It’s never come up before! Will you call her for me?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>No! I’ll send you her number. I do not have the time or the patience to be playing operator!</span></em> <em><span>Good luck tracking Rio down. Next time just get her chipped or something.”</span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>Jen ended the call abruptly leaving Agatha pacing around her room until her phone buzzed with Alice’s number. She immediately pressed it to dial and put the phone on speaker while she breathed deeply trying to stay calm. As the phone rang and rang and rang she could feel her son moving about, almost as if he was growing just as nervous as she was. </span><em><span>Ring, Ring, Ring</span></em><span>. She closed her eyes and started rubbing circles on her swollen belly urging him to relax. </span><em><span>Ring, Ring</span></em><span>. And just as she was about to hang up she heard the front door click and some voices shuffle into her living room. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She rushed down the hall already shouting. “RIO VIDAL! That better be you! And you better have a damn good excuse as to …where…you’ve been.” She stopped suddenly as she rounded the corner to find Alice and Yelena helping a hobbling, braced, crutch stricken Rio to the couch. “Rio! What the fuck?!” She asked, mouth agape and eyes wide with confusion and horror. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Look! Look! There she is! I told you guys! Isn’t she the most beautiful, wonderful person you’ve ever seen?” Rio babbled, her eyes wide and heart shaped as Agatha walked closer. Then her face turned serious and she gasped, “It’s like she’s not even real! Like she’s an alien or something!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“One of you two tell me what the fuck is going on! With a quickness!” Agatha snapped and pointed to Alice. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Heyyy, Agatha!” Alice breathed nervously </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, don't hey Agatha me! What the hell happened to my girlfriend?!” Agatha snapped</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh no! You have a girlfriend?” Rio sighed pitifully from the couch. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes, my love, you’re my girlfriend!” She huffed as she eased onto the couch next to the clearly inebriated Rio to get a better look at the damage. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Me?! You like me?” Rio blushed as she gathered Agatha’s hands in hers and held them close to her chest. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Most of the time. Right now I’m not so sure!” She chuckled as she pried a hand free to stroke a piece of Rio’s hair back away from her face. She had to admit it was hard to be too cross when she was this loopy. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright out with it!” Agatha commanded, once again turning her attention to Alice and Yelena. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So during the pick up game today…” Alice started </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ugh! What did she do?” Agatha breathed heavily as her eyes fluttered closed, trying with all her might to hold onto her last bit of patience. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well it wasn’t really her exactly…” Yelena cut in. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, really it was this asshole Chad’s fault.” Alice expounded. “He kind of body slammed her when she jumped to make this shot and I guess she landed weird and then kind of crumpled to the ground.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She fought us on it but we took her to the emergency room. Her knee was wicked swollen. I was worried she had ripped it to shreds. She couldn’t even stand!” Yelena explained</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Woah your hair is like the silkiest waterfall! It’s so soft and long and it’s everywhere!” Rio giggled in delight as she ran her fingers through Agatha’s hair. Agatha glanced down and with a tight smile removed Rio’s hands from her hair. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What did the doctors say?” She asked, picking up right where they left off as if she wasn’t dealing with an adult sized toddler. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She got lucky! It’s a pretty bad sprain, some mild tearing but they said they shouldn’t have to do surgery. She’ll just have to take it slow. Keep the brace on it. Ice it every few hours. Pain meds as needed. She’ll probably need the crutches for at least the next few days but she can walk on it again once all the swelling is down. Overall she’ll heal on her own. Could be 8-12 weeks though.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“8-12 weeks?!” Agatha gasped. “Oh perfect! Just what we needed! And why exactly is she like…this?” They all looked down to find Rio stroking her hands along Agatha’s stomach. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“There’s someone in there!” Rio whispered as she stared intently at the bump. “Helloooo! How are you? What are you doing in there?” She half sung with somewhat of a French accent. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha sighed deeply as she rolled her eyes and chose to ignore whatever was happening to stare questioningly at Yelena and Alice. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So about that, bit of a funny story actually.” Yelena started. “At one point they did have to give her a mild sedative.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“For what?” Agatha groaned</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well they needed to get a CT scan of the knee to see how bad the tear was and she has a </span><em><span>thing</span></em><span> about tight spaces and loud noises.” Yelena explained</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She does?” Agatha’s eyebrows arched in disbelief</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh yeah! She…uh…kind of started to have a panic attack so they offered her a mild sedative. Which helped but as you can see she’s very much a light weight when it comes to drugs. On top of that they gave her a couple oxy for the pain before we left so yeah, she’s on cloud 9 right now.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio began tapping at Agatha’s arm trying to get her attention. “Hey! Hey!!! Hey you!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes, dear?” Agatha replied, appeasing the request.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re my girlfriend right?” Rio asked with a frown.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes, my love.” Agatha sighed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Then whose baby is this?” Rio asked, her face scrunched in confusion as she poked the bump.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s our baby sweetheart.” Agatha explained as she rolled her eyes and brushed Rio’s hands off of her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“WOAH! I did that?” Rio’s eyes bulged and she gasped in amazement as she stared in awe at her own hands. “I’m like a super lesbian! I’m too powerful!” She moved to try and sit up. “I must be stopped!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, my love, just relax. You’re perfectly mortal I’m afraid.” Agatha said as she guided her gently to lie back down. “And why didn’t I hear from any of you?! </span><em><span>I</span></em><span> was panicking and this close to heading out to look for her!” She scolded Alice and Yelena.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I know! I know! I’m sorry! Rio begged us not to.” Alice explained. “She didn’t want us to worry you, said you were busy enough and didn’t need the added stress. Also she said she had texted you at some point.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She did not!” Agatha growled through gritted teeth. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, well, super sorry about that! Really, I should have texted you!” Alice grimaced</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’d be hard to do considering you don’t have my number.” Agatha snapped</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes I do.” Alice chuckled</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How? When did that happen?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Jen gave it to me like a month after we started dating as like an emergency contact to call.” Alice shrugged</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well then yes! You should have definitely called me as soon as they sedated her!! I was worried fucking sick!” Agatha groaned</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well, she’s all in one piece and it could have been a lot worse.” Yelena shrugged. “She just has some pretty horrendous swelling right now which we should probably try and ice soon. Got any?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, there’s a dispenser in the freezer and plastic bags in the drawer by the sink.” She instructed Yelena. “There should be some towels in the bottom drawer if you need it.” She added then turned back to Rio. “What am I going to do with you?!” She grumbled frustratedly as she squished her face between her hands. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“A kisth…perhapths?” Rio managed to squeak out through squished cheeks as she closed her eyes and puckered her lips.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha rolled her eyes and placed a peck on Rio’s forehead before moving to join Alice and Yelena in the kitchen. “I guess I should be thanking you both. I have to say I am a bit relieved she’s not dead in a ditch somewhere.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No! She’s alive and well, just high off her ass.” Yelena snorted as she fixed a bag of ice. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are either of you hungry? I may have ordered way too much food in the midst of my panicking.” Agatha offered as she began to unpack the brown bags on the counter. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Starving actually! Thanks!” Alice said as she helped Agatha unpack the food. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright Vidal, I’m taking off this brace so we can ice your knee. It’s going to be cold but I need you to leave it on there for a bit, ok?” Yelena instructed </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Aye aye, </span><em><span>Mon Capitaine</span></em><span>!” Rio saluted before gasping in shock at the cold. “AHHHH! I don’t like it!” Rio shook her head with a serious frown.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, it might be uncomfortable for a bit but it’s not forever so try and tough it out.” Yelena chuckled</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ok.” She grimaced. “Hey! Hey!” She whispered urgently to Yelena.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What’s up?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Any chance you can convince that pretty lady to come back and sit with me?” Rio giggled</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha?” Yelena snorted “Yeah, I think I can do that. You want me to see if she’ll bring you some food too?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“AH! She has food? Fuck yeah!” Rio squeaked in delight</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, dude she’s got food. We’ll make you a plate.” Yelena replied as she returned to the kitchen. “She’s not going to remember shit tomorrow!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I had no idea she was so sensitive!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh yeah, in med school she had to have her appendix taken out and she was so high on pain meds she thought she could read minds. Really she was just listening to Nat and me studying for finals.” Yelena chuckled </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And where did the claustrophobia come from?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That…well…she’s had that since the accident I think.” Yelena explained. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What accident?” Agatha asked, frowning in confusion. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh…I… I thought she told you about her mom and brother.” Yelena cringed in panic. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well, yeah, kind of. She said they died in a car accident.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, she was in the car too. I guess she was trapped with them for a couple hours before help came.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck!” Alice gasped </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Not sure if I was supposed to tell you that but yeah.”Yelena shrugged</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I…I had no idea!” Agatha gasped as she stared at Rio who was on the couch whistling and playing with her fingers. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She’s a tough cookie! If it were me they would have had to knock me all the way the fuck out. I honestly don’t know how she did it!” Yelena scoffed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hello? Who is this? Your voice is </span><em><span>really </span></em><span>tiny, I can’t see you!” They heard Rio’s voice shout from the couch.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, shit!” Agatha gasped as she dropped her plates on the counter to go take her phone from Rio. “Sweetheart, here, give me the phone!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes please, I have no idea what they’re saying!” She replied as she handed her the phone upside down.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hello?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>I take it you found her?” </span></em><span>Lilia’s voice laughed on the other end of the line.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, hey Lilia. Yeah, she stumbled in with Yelena and Alice about half an hour ago.”</span></p><p> </p><p><em><span>“Is she drunk?”</span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, actually, she was in the emergency room.”</span></p><p> </p><p><em><span>“What?! Is everything ok?”</span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, she’s fine, just a bad sprain apparently. They have her pretty drugged up.” </span></p><p> </p><p><em><span>“Oh boy! It doesn’t take much with that one. Do you need any help?”</span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>“Maybe tomorrow. I don’t know how she’s going to feel in the morning. Right now I still have Alice and Yelena here. I’m gonna see if they can help me put her to bed in a bit.” </span></p><p> </p><p><em><span>“Alright, doll! Well, you let me know! I’m just a phone call away!”</span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>“Thanks, Lilia, I appreciate that. I’ll talk to you tomorrow at some point.” She hung up the phone and went back to plating dinner. “You guys don’t mind, do you? After we eat we can try and put her to bed.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, of course! Wouldn’t want you to have to try and manage her while she’s in this state! Who knows what would happen!” Yelena laughed as she took her food over to sit in the living room.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I can’t even begin to imagine! Ugh! Lilia just made me realize I don’t know what I’m going to do with her tomorrow! Clearly she’s not going anywhere, but I have an appointment in the morning and another gloriously packed schedule at work. I don’t know that I’d have time to come check on her.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t worry about it! I’m happy to manage the invalid for you!” Yelena beamed through a mouthful of food.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Really? You don’t mind?” Agatha asked as she settled back on the couch next to Rio.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Of course not! I was planning on hanging with her anyway, that’s why I came up a day early. Also, to help with the party.” Yelena shrugged  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, shit! I forgot about the party! There’s no way that’s happening now!” Agatha gleamed with excitement.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“We’re having a party?” Rio asked as Agatha handed her a plate of food.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, sweetheart, we’re canceling the party.” Agatha explained</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What? No party? But why?” Rio’s eyes grew wide as her lower lip jutted out in a pout.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You injured yourself, hon, you shouldn’t be dealing with a party!” Agatha replied, trying to sound more disappointed than she actually was. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, but I love parties! Please! Please, can we still have the party?” She begged as her eyes grew glassy with tears.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m going to say yes because you probably won’t remember this and I don’t want to deal with you being upset right now.” Agatha huffed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes to the party?” Rio sniffled to which Agatha nodded and waved her hand as she took a bite of food. “YAY! We’re having a party! Are you guys gonna come?” she asked, turning to Alice and Yelena.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh absolutely dude! It’s gonna be a blast!” Yelena snickered</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Wouldn’t miss it!” Alice chuckled</span></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><span>Nearly an hour later, once their plates had been cleared and Rio was half passed out, leaning against Agatha, Alice and Yelena helped her to bed and said their goodbyes. As Agatha put away the leftovers and cleaned off the counters she could feel her son also settling in for the night as he turned and stretched inside her. “Not quite the night we had planned, huh little bug?” she cooed as she turned off the lights. She took a few steps down the hallway toward the bedroom and then she felt it, a quiet pressure that rippled from the top of her stomach down and settled into her lower back as it grew in intensity. She latched on to the door frame of the hall bathroom and breathed in deeply through her nose and out through her mouth until the pain passed. As she felt the grip of the contraction begin to lessen she pushed herself free from the doorway and stood, cradling her belly. “Oooo, that was a doozy! I did not like that! How about you bug?” She felt a small shift as she continued down the hallway. “We don’t need any more of that just yet! You still have a few weeks of cooking left to do.” She chuckled to herself though the pang of worry hung in her heart. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She tried her best to shake it off as she pushed her way into the bedroom and slid into bed with a completely passed out Rio. She curled onto her side, snuggling her head into the crook of Rio’s neck and shoulder as she breathed in her intoxicating earthy fragrance. Almost immediately her worries were soothed and she quickly drifted off into a dreamless slumber.</span></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><span>—-----------------------------------------------------------</span></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><span>It was a light rustling and shuffling that first brought Rio into the waking world. She could hear someone moving about around her as her eyes became aware of the lightness in the room behind her eyelids. As she slowly cracked an eye open she began to feel a dull radiating pain that emanated from her right leg. She groaned as she stretched herself awake, feeling the stiffness pop and crack at her movements.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, good! You’re awake.” Agatha huffed as she crossed over to her while she affixed a pair of earrings. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What time is it?” Rio’s voice crackled with morning weariness</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Nearly 7:45. How are you feeling, my love?” Agatha asked as she slid on her watch. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Like I got hit by a bus. Wait, what day is it?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Friday, and I’m afraid I’m running late so we’ll have to make this quick. Yelena will be over by 8:30 to help with whatever you need. I’ll call you on my way to work and let you know how the appointment went. There’s a bottle of Ibuprofen and a glass of water on the nightstand, is there anything I can get you before I head out?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hold on, give me a couple minutes, I’m going with you.” Rio insisted as she moved to sit at the edge of the bed. As soon as her leg swung out from under the blanket she hissed in pain.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Absolutely not! You are taking some medicine and lying back down in that bed until Yelena gets here.” Agatha scolded as she grabbed the bottle of pills to hand Rio two. “Do you even realize what condition you’re in?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I vaguely remember getting pummeled by some dickwad and going to the hospital. After that not so much. What’s the prognosis?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Bedrest, ice, and anti-inflamitories. So no, you’re not coming with me. You can’t walk, let alone drive, and I don’t have time to bring you back afterward. Which reminds me, you need to call everyone and cancel the party. Sooner rather than later.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Woah, wait! Why exactly are we canceling the party?” Rio asked as she wobbled to stand on her one good leg and hop over to grab her crutches.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I think it’s pretty obvious, there’s no way you can manage throwing a party in your current condition.” Agatha huffed as she waddled into the closet.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha, it’s not like I lost a limb! I just twisted my knee.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sprained your knee, dear. Tore a ligament. You’re in no position to throw a party!” She scolded as she returned with her one pair of shoes.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh you’re just looking for any excuse not to have this!” Rio spat.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“True, I may not be as upset about that outcome as you are but you have to admit it’s for the best.” Agatha said as she struggled to put the shoes on. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I do not! I have plenty of people to help me! Nat and Hela are driving in tonight for it! We’re not canceling the party!” Rio protested</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Look I don’t really have time to fight you on this like I probably should so if you’re this adamant about still having it then fine, you do what you want.” Agatha snapped as she bolted out of the bedroom.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha! Wait! What’s wrong? Why are you so upset?” Rio called out as she hobbled after her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Heh, you can’t seriously be asking me that!” Agatha scoffed as she grabbed a yogurt and a banana from the kitchen.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Look I’m sorry, it was an accident. I really didn’t mean to get hurt!” Rio groaned</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha laughed mirthlessly as she glared at Rio. “You think I’m mad because you hurt yourself?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well, yeah, I know it just made things 10x more stressful at the worst possible time.”  Rio replied as she diverted her gaze.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re right, this is probably the worst possible timing for you to hurt yourself but that is not why I’m upset with you.” Agatha spat sternly</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s not?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“NO! Do you have any idea how worried I was about you?!” Agatha shouted, leaving a silent void in her wake. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio stood frozen on the spot as Agatha’s words hit her like a freight train. “I…I didn’t realize...” she dared herself to whisper in response.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No shit! I didn’t hear from you all day! I texted you and called you and there was no response. I waited as patiently as I could but I knew something was up. And then of course my thought was where did she even go? Where would I try and go look for her? Who would even think to call me if…” She stalled her rant as tears of rage began to fill her eyes. “And clearly my fears were not unfounded. You </span><em><span>were </span></em><span>in the hospital and I’m told, instructed those around you </span><em><span>not </span></em><span>to contact me.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I didn’t want to…” Rio began sheepishly</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Save it!” Agatha growled. “If you don’t want to worry me, or stress me out, you have to tell me what’s going on, even if it’s something you know I’m not going to like.” They stood in silence for a moment as Rio let the words sink in. “Did you really have a panic attack?” Agatha asked softly though her fury didn’t waver.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What?” Rio’s eyes flashed in shock. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yelena said you had a panic attack when they tried to do a CT scan and they had to sedate you.” Rio swallowed hard looking petrified. “Something about tight spaces and loud noises?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I…um…” she cleared her throat. “I don’t really remember but it…it sounds about right.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha sighed, her blue eyes stormy with empathy and worry. “I wish you would have let me be there for you, the way you’ve been there for me.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio hung her head ashamed. “I’m sorry. I should have told you.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes! You should have. Look, I’m not going to hold it over you. I’m glad you’re ok and it wasn’t anything more serious. Now please, do me a favor and rest, for the both of us! I’m hoping to be home by 6 but we’ll see how that goes.” Agatha grumbled as she gathered her keys. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I promise, I’ll take it easy. You try and do the same as much as you can.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’ll do my best.” She pressed a quick kiss to Rio’s cheek before heading to the door. “Let me know how you’re doing throughout the day. Love you!” she said as the door closed quickly behind her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Love you too.” Rio muttered into the silence of the empty house. </span></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><span>—-------------------------------------------</span></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><span>By 8:45 Agatha was seated on the stiff exam room table with her foot bouncing as she picked at her nail beds. The room felt hollow and ominous without Rio pacing about in excitement next to her. She chewed at the inside of her mouth as the many concerns she usually kept at bay were swarming her mind in the silence. </span><em><span>Was everything alright? Was he still ok? Was the medication working? Were the Braxton hicks supposed to be that painful? </span></em><span>She could feel her heart beginning to race as the minutes ticked by. Then, just as her thoughts were about to spiral further she heard a knock at the door. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey Agatha! Good to see you! How are you feeling?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“A bit tired but alright otherwise.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Not too surprising. No Rio today? Did she get called in?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Um, no, she somehow managed to injure herself playing basketball yesterday so she’s home healing and resting.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh no! I hope it’s not anything too serious!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, just a bad sprain. Hopefully she’ll bounce back quickly.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“For your sake I hope that’s the case! We’re getting down to the wire here aren’t we!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s beginning to feel that way!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So how’s everything else going? Any changes in movement? Any new aches or pains?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, he's as active as ever, though definitely running out of room! I think just the usual aches and pains. Back, hips, feet, everything that moves really.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s to be expected at this stage. What about Braxton hicks? Any changes there?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well Jen had warned me they’d be more frequent as I got closer but the last couple of days they’ve been pretty intense.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“When you say intense, what does that look like? Are you able to go about what you’re doing and it’s more of a moderate pain or is it stopping you in your tracks?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“More so the latter. There was one last night that nearly knocked the wind out of me, it was so nasty.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ok, good to know. Well we’ll take a look today and see where everything is.” She flashed Agatha a tight but reassuring smile. “Go ahead and lie back and I’ll get you measured.” Agatha laid back onto the table and exposed her swollen belly to the frigid exam room air as Dr. Allen stretched a tape measure along the surface. “Well I have you measuring a little behind at 32 but I can feel baby’s head right where my thumb is down here.” She pressed in slightly causing him to kick just behind her ribs eliciting a sharp breath in. “Oh! I felt that! He is feisty!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re telling me!” Agatha groaned. “What does that mean exactly?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It could be any number of things. There are a few more things I’d like to check first, that way I can narrow it down and let you know if there’s anything we should be concerned about.” She took a brief glance at her chart before she continued. “Your blood pressure is looking good, it looks like the medication is working. Are you still monitoring that throughout the day?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And how’s that been looking for you? Any spikes or has it been trending down?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s gone down for the most part but there are spikes here and there.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Good to know. That’s not uncommon, as you’ve just started taking this medication. Just make sure to continue monitoring. It’s important to be aware of if it’s spiking during a specific time or in a specific situation, to see if something may be triggering it that we can mitigate. Other than that, keep doing what you’re doing there. If you’re ready we’ll go ahead and take a look at the little guy.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha nodded as she braced herself for the gel. Before long she felt the familiar pressure of the ultrasound wand as her son’s steady heartbeat filled the room. She glanced over at the screen and saw bright and clear the details of his tiny face. He had his little hand tucked under his nose and was contentedly sucking his thumb. It was strange to see how much he’d grown and changed. He’d gone so quickly from this tiny, spindly, roughly human shaped form to now a fully formed, chubby little baby with her pointy dimpled chin. She could almost hear the comments Rio would be making. </span><em><span>I swear he gets cuter every time we see him! Hey little guy! Not much longer and it’ll be my turn to hold you!</span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>Dr. Allen clicked about for a moment, as Agatha admired him, taking different measurements and pictures, before she spoke again. </span></p><p><span>“Alright, fluid is looking good, baby is measuring to be just about 4.5lbs which is on the low end but still within range of where we want him to be at this stage. We are definitely head down which, as long as he stays that way, should hopefully mean a pretty smooth delivery. I do want to go ahead and check your cervix, given you’ve had some changes in intensity with the contractions and then I can let you know where we’re at overall. Ok?” Dr. Allen explained as she helped Agatha sit up. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, of course, whatever you think is best.” Agatha agreed though she was not thrilled by the idea, particularly without Rio by her side.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m gonna step out and grab another box of gloves, it looks like this room is out. If you wouldn't mind getting undressed the rest of the way. I’ll be back in just a few minutes.” And with the soft click of the door Agatha was alone again in the exam room. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She let out a grunt as she slipped off the table. A large part of her was relieved at everything Dr. Allen had shared but she couldn’t help the flutter of nerves that had ignited at the realization of how quickly everything was progressing. Not long ago it had felt like she would never become a mother, that that chapter of her life had passed, and now she was weeks away from meeting the little life inside her and it was more terrifying than she could have anticipated. Even after all this time she didn’t feel ready, for contractions, for labor, for him. She hadn’t even decided on a name, didn’t have anything in his room ready, and yet time was racing by. </span></p><p><span>As she slid off the pants she now regretted choosing that morning, her heart ached for Rio. Her calming yet exuberant presence was exactly what she craved to squash the fears and doubts looming in her mind. She would have known exactly what to say, exactly how to comfort and reassure her that everything would work out, that she was strong enough to face what would undoubtedly be the most difficult trial she had yet to encounter. As she settled back onto the table she considered for a brief moment calling her to sit in on the rest of the appointment, even just to hear her voice, but just as she was about to hop down again and grab her phone Dr. Allen returned with a knock at the door. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“All set?” She greeted cheerily as she closed the door behind her. Agatha nodded briefly with silent anxiety. “Alright, you can go ahead and lie back down.” Dr. Allen instructed as she resumed her seat on the rolling stool. “You have any plans for this weekend?” She asked nonchalantly as she readied herself, catching Agatha a bit off guard. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I…um…yes actually, we’re…uh… supposed to have a baby shower tomorrow.” She replied as her gaze fixed on the ceiling tiles above her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh how nice! That should be fun!” She said excitedly as she placed a hand on Agatha’s knee. “Ok, you’ll just feel a slight bit of pressure, just try and relax. Do you have a lot of friends and family coming?” </span></p><p> </p><p><em><span>Why was she trying to have a casual conversation right now?! </span></em><span>“I…um…not sure.” Agatha’s mind warred as she struggled to hold her focus while Dr. Allen was exploring the depths of her nether regions. Gods, she wished Rio were here. “Rio planned the whole thing.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh how sweet! So kind of a surprise party?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I guess…you could say that.” Agatha let out a breath as she felt Dr. Allen remove her hand. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Very good. Well I’m all set if you want to get comfortable and we can go over the results.” She snapped off her gloves and threw them in the trash as she rolled over to wash her hands. Agatha pried her legs from the stirrups and pushed herself to sit up. “So you are fully effaced and about 2 centimeters dilated.” Agatha could feel her stomach launch into her throat. “That’s likely due to those contractions you felt.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So those were real?” Agatha muttered in shock</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It appears so.” Dr. Allen replied with unnerving ease.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sh…should I be concerned?” Agatha stuttered</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’d be more cautious than concerned just yet. Given you’re somewhat of a high risk there is always a chance it could progress into preterm labor so we do want to avoid that if at all possible. This means limiting any strenuous activity, definitely no heavy lifting, staying off your feet as much as possible. Gravity isn’t really our friend right now. However, given the contractions aren’t consistent, you haven't quite dropped yet, and we’ve seen a decrease in your blood pressure I’m not terribly worried at this point. I’m not going to commit you to bedrest or anything but we do want to continue to monitor closely and make sure things don’t progress too quickly, and make sure those lungs have a chance to fully develop. That being said, I think we might meet the little guy before the end of May.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha’s heart dropped. “May is next week.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes.” Dr. Allen nodded with an amused smile.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Isn’t that… wouldn’t that be too soon? I’m not due until June!” Agatha scoffed in disbelief.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“The due date is a rough estimate. Really there’s about a four week window, two weeks before, two weeks after that would be considered within the normal range. The goal is always to get to 37 weeks, which would put you about mid May. Really you’re getting that baby shower in just in time!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha’s face drained of color as she let out a breath of a laugh. If she had thought her time was running out before, now it was as if the final grains of sand were circling the drain in the hour glass. She wasn’t ready! How could she be? There was still so much to do and of course she had her obligations to the festival. </span><em><span>UGH! The fucking festival!</span></em><span> She couldn’t afford to tap out early as the only person really holding the whole thing together. Sure Herb was there with the management company overseeing the big picture and Sharon had been a huge help in keeping things organized, but everything hinged on her plan, on her attention to detail as the weeks shifted from theme to theme. This was the last news she wanted to hear. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Is…is there anything I can do to make sure he holds off on his grand entrance until June? I’ve been working on this festival and May is just </span><em><span>really </span></em><span>not a good time for me!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ha! I don’t know that I’ve ever had a patient ask me that before! Usually they’re like, </span><em><span>get this baby out of me</span></em><span>!” Dr. Allen laughed as Agatha stared back at her in a panicked unease. “Oh, forgive me! Unfortunately, no, babies have their own timing, when he’s ready he’s ready. Now, I’m not saying you won’t make it to June, that’s still possible, but looking at where you’re at now it’s best to be prepared for sooner rather than later.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha let her eyes flutter closed as she tried to make peace with this news. “Great! That’s…that’s just fantastic!” she groaned sardonically as she brought up a hand to rub at her temple.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m sorry if that wasn’t quite the answer you were looking for, it can be difficult to manage work responsibilities at this stage when the timing is a little uncertain. Would it be helpful for me to write a recommendation that you take some time off?” Dr. Allen offered</span></p><p> </p><p><span>”NO! No, I can’t really afford to miss a day! Our entire future as an organization hinges on this next month being a success and that falls to me.” Agatha replied a little more harshly than she intended to.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Dr. Allen gazed at her with sympathetic concern. “That sounds like a lot of pressure.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“A bit. I can handle it, just as long as no one makes any surprise appearances.” Agatha huffed, trying in vain to bring some levity to the topic.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well, I’m not here to tell you not to work but I do want to emphasize that unfortunately, much of this is out of your control and I would hope your work would understand that. Your health and your baby’s health has to take priority over anything happening there.” Dr. Allen insisted.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>The directness of those statements cut her right to the core. It all was out of her control and that knowledge, that fear alone was almost more than she could bear so her mind fixated on the one thing she could control. “Right, of course. In the meantime…I’m fine to continue working, correct?” After all, what else could she do?</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Dr. Allen cracked a concerned smile. “Yes, I don’t have a problem with you working, if you can appropriately manage the stress of it.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Understood.” Agatha replied rather curtly, her nerves growing sharper by the minute.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Do you have any other questions for me before I let you go?” Dr. Allen asked gently, seeing how all this had rattled her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Had Rio been here, there would have been a whole host of questions she’d ask. But here alone, under the weight of all she had been told, Agatha’s mind drew a blank. “No.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Very well! Then I’ll leave you to get dressed and I’ll see you back in a couple weeks.” Dr. Allen said on her way out the door. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha sat in the vacuum of silence, heavy in the wake of what could be. Excitement and hope lingered in the back of her mind but fear and doubt overshadowed them completely. Her gaze lingered on her bump as she watched his foot graze against the surface. “Please little bug, not too soon!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>—----------------------------------------------------</span></p><p> </p><p><span>After a precarious and somewhat treacherous shower, Rio had made herself comfortable on the couch playing Zelda as she waited for Yelena to arrive. It was all she could do for the time being to distract herself from her uncomfortable conversation with Agatha that morning, her injury, and the fact that she was missing out on her appointment because of it. She had just been squashed flat by a Goron yet again when she heard a knock at the door. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s open!” She hollered towards the door as she reset herself in the game only to immediately be pummeled by the same Goron as she waited for the person to enter. “I SAID IT’S OPEN!” She shouted again.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Dude, chill! I got my hands full!” Yelena snickered as she closed the door behind her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“FUCK!” Rio screamed in frustration as the beast squashed her yet again. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Not your day is it?” Yelena laughed as she put the bags she was carrying down on the kitchen table.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You have no idea!” Rio grumbled as she reset herself once again.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Why don’t we take a break?” Yelena suggested as she picked up the remote and turned off the TV.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey! What the fuck? I almost had him that time!” Rio groaned in protest</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No you didn’t!” Yelena scoffed, “Sit up, I brought breakfast.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m not hungry.” she grumbled, refusing to move from her reclined position.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don’t believe that for one second! Have you eaten anything?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Then you’re hungry, and pouting, which is pathetic by the way. Here” She tossed a burrito into Rio’s lap. “Eat!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio rolled her eyes as she moved to sit and slowly unwrap the burrito. She let out a heavy sigh and begrudgingly took a bite. Her eyes fluttered closed and she let out a moan as soon as the food hit her tongue, the warm, spicy, cheesy morsel hit her with a wave of comfort she hadn’t realized she needed. She immediately dove back in for a larger bite, and then another in a ravenous hunger.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Good huh?” Yelena nodded with an </span><em><span>I told you so </span></em><span>kind of smirk on her face. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ok, maybe I was hungrier than I thought.” She managed to spit out between bites.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I knew you would be! How's the knee feeling?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Like Chad’s gonna wish he was dead the next time I get ahold of him! Dude, it’s fucked! It’s like 3x its normal size.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Show me to me.” Yelena instructed as she set her food down on the coffee table.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio huffed as she finished off the first half of her burrito and adjusted herself to stand on her good leg. She tucked her thumbs into the waistband of her sweatpants and pushed them to the ground, practically falling on Yelena as she did so.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Jeez! Thanks for the warning before you put your ass in my face!” Yelena exclaimed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh grow up! Don’t act like it’s the first time you’ve seen it!” She growled as she turned her leg to face Yelena. “See!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Damn, you really got your ass beat! Have you been icing it?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>hAvE yOu BeEn IcInG iT?” </span></em><span>Rio mocked “What do you think?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Dude!” Yelena snapped at her. “Just doing my fucking job here man! I’m gonna need you to chill!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sorry.” Rio mumbled as she tugged her pants back up and threw herself back onto the couch. “UGH! I’m just so fucking pissed at myself right now! I fucked up everything!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, I’m getting that, you’re pouting like a teenager, but you didn’t fuck anything up.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Bro, I’m hobbling around like a weeble wobble, I have so much shit to get together for Agatha’s party that she doesn’t even fucking want for some reason, she’s pissed at me because I didn’t say anything to her yesterday and though she won’t admit it I’m sure she’s pissed that I’m injured too, I was supposed to go to this fucking appointment with her this morning but instead I get to stay home worried sick about her and be a fucking couch warmer instead, and Chad can lick my sweaty, hairy, ballsack!” She sped through it all without hardly taking a breath. By the time she reached the end her body was nearly shaking with rage as her chest heaved, sucking in air. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Feel better?” Yelena asked calmly</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“A bit yeah.” Rio huffed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Good. Now it’s my turn.” Yelena said before taking a bite of food. “So you’re injured. It happens, nothing you can do about it now so sorry but get the fuck over it.” Rio stared at her blankly. “As for this party that Agatha doesn’t want.” Rio’s face scrunched into a frown. “Why the fuck are you having it then?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I wanted to do something nice for her and the baby. She’s been through so much, is constantly stressed, and I just wanted one day where she could be excited and feel supported. So she wasn’t going into this feeling like she’s alone, that she has to do everything on her own.” </span></p><p><span>“As admirable as that may be…if she doesn’t want the party she’s not going to feel the things you want her to feel and it’s probably going to be overwhelming and stressful instead.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio scrunched her face in consideration, “I guess I hadn’t really thought about it like that.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Yelena snickered, “Of course you hadn’t. You love parties!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I do love parties. Ugh!” Rio slapped her hands to her face “Then what the hell am I going to do? I can’t cancel it at this point!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You don’t have to. If you wanna throw a party for the baby fucking do it, just don’t involve Agatha. It sounds like that would not go over well. Maybe everyone can help you get the room ready instead. I took a look in there last night and that’s definitely going to take longer than you think. Especially with that bum leg of yours.” Yelena chuckled</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio considered the proposal, realizing just how many of her problems that would actually solve. “You know, that idea's not half bad! Maybe I can tell her it got postponed, have Jen keep her occupied a little bit longer, have people come a little bit earlier. By the time she gets home everyone will be gone and everything’s ready for the baby.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I have a feeling she’d love that more than coming home to a bunch of people in her house.” Yelena shrugged</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, yeah that’s fucking brilliant! I knew we were friends for a reason!” She said, patting Yelena on the back.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Haha, glad I could help. Now, with regards to her being pissed at you. I can’t say I blame her. She thought you got into a car wreck or something.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I know! I should have just texted her when it happened. I was trying to avoid making her worry and stressing her out but it did just the opposite.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, that tends to happen when you don’t communicate. Did you learn your lesson?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>”Yes.” Rio grumbled</span></p><p> </p><p><span>”Did you apologize?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>”Yes.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>”Then there’s not much else to do but do better next time. And I doubt she’s mad that you’re hurt. If anything she’s just glad you’re alive.” Yelena replied with a caring smile.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You know it’s really annoying how you seem to know exactly what to say to simultaneously make me feel like an asshole but also make me feel better.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>”What can I say? It’s a gift.” Yelena chuckled as she ate the last of her burrito. “What time was her appointment this morning?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She had to be there by 8:30. Should be wrapping up soon. She did say she’d give me a call on her way to work to let me know how it went.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“See! All that griping for nothing! It’s all going to work out! If you’re finished with breakfast maybe I can grab you some ice and we can head in and get a start on unboxing all the shit in the baby’s room.” Yelena offered as she stood from the couch and headed into the kitchen.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah it’d be a good idea to get a headstart while I have you.” Rio pushed herself to standing and reached for her crutches. As soon as she had herself situated her phone began to ring on the coffee table. “Shit! It’s Agatha!” She threw the crutches to the floor and practically dove to answer the phone.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>”Hey baby! How’d it go? How’s our little guy?” She cooed into the phone</span></p><p> </p><p><span>”</span><em><span>Hey, hon. It…uh…it went well. He’s…he’s as perfect as ever. How are you feeling? Did Yelena get there alright?</span></em><span>”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>”Yeah Yelena’s here, she's grabbing me some more ice. What did she say about your blood pressure? And the spikes? Any concern there?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>”</span><em><span>She said it’s looking good, the spikes aren’t a concern because I just started taking the medicine but to still keep an eye on it. See if there’s anything triggering it that I can avoid if possible.</span></em><span>”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>”I can think of a couple things that should be on that list.” Rio mumbled into the phone.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>”</span><em><span>Oh don’t worry, dear, you’re right at the top</span></em><span>!” Agatha snickered</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Haha, fair point but you know that’s not what I’m referring to.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>”</span><em><span>I can only assume it’s festival related.</span></em><span>” She could hear the unamused tension in Agatha’s voice.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>”You said it, not me!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>”</span><em><span>But you were thinking it and unfortunately sweetheart, like we’ve talked about before, it’s completely unavoidable! Especially now, I really can’t afford to miss any of the planning or execution otherwise this whole thing will fall apart.</span></em><span>”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>”Somehow I doubt that! I’m sure Herb can manage just fine without you!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>”</span><em><span>You would think so. Fortunately they won’t have to worry, I’ll be there for it all!”</span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh really? She cleared you to work?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>”</span><em><span>Yes.</span></em><span>”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>”The entire festival?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>”</span><em><span>As long as he stays put, yes.”</span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>“Even though that’s like your primary stressor.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Hardly!</span></em><span>”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>”Agatha! Were you completely honest with her? She knows how demanding this all is, right?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>”</span><em><span>Sorry, my love, I’m having trouble hearing you, I just pulled into the garage.”</span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>“Crazy, I can hear you just fine.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>It’s getting a little dicey! I’ll talk with you more when I get home!”</span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright, have a good day! Try to take it easy! Love you!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>”</span><em><span>Love you too!”</span></em><span> And with a quick click Agatha hung up. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio stared at the screen shaking her head in frustration before she threw her phone on the couch. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That sounded…reassuring.” Yelena smirked </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hardly! I swear she’s going to put me into an early grave.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Eh, tit for tat with that one!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What’s that supposed to mean?”</span></p><p><span>“Dude you practically gave her a heart attack yesterday!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fair enough.” Rio rolled her eyes as she grabbed her crutches from the floor. “Alright, let’s go get this room sorted before I start to spiral again.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ha! Alright, right behind you man.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>—---------------------------------------------</span></p><p><span>It was nearly 8 by the time Rio heard Agatha’s car pull into the driveway. Two hours past the time she said she would be home and for the first time since Yelena had left earlier that afternoon she felt like she could breathe. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>They had managed to make a large dent in unboxing and organizing stuff in the baby’s room which had kept her mind occupied for most of the day but as soon as she was alone all her anxieties came rushing back. She had whittled away the first hour preparing dinner for when Agatha came home, hoping to ease her into relaxing after what surely must have been a draining and demanding day. But then the minutes ticked by. After about 30 minutes past she shot her a text. </span></p><p> </p><p><em><span>Miss you! Hope you’re doing alright! Scratchy and I can’t wait for you to come home. </span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>She paired it with a selfie of her on the couch and Scratchy snuggled tightly in the crook of her neck and shoulder. She threw on a show and waited, her hand never drifting far from her phone hoping for a response from Agatha to say she was on her way home. One episode passed and then another with no reply. </span><em><span>Was she ok or was this just payback from the night before? </span></em><span>Knowing Agatha it was likely petty retribution or worse she was indeed overworking herself and unable to reply. She decided to shoot her another text hoping it would spark some sort of response. </span></p><p> </p><p><em><span>Let me know when you’re headed home and I can heat up your dinner! </span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>Send. She waited and waited, growing more anxious by the second. Then just as she was about to call the headlights glared through the front window. Rio leapt up to turn off the tv and grab her crutches as she rushed to meet Agatha. </span></p><p><span>As the door swung open Agatha stumbled in looking as if she might collapse from exhaustion and threw her bag to the ground beside the door. She padded over to Rio who was standing, leaning against the side of the couch and let herself be swallowed in Rio’s embrace. </span></p><p><span>Rio cradled her close, burying her face in  a mess of waves and curls as she breathed in her intoxicatingly sweet fragrance. She could feel the weight of her fatigue as Agatha leaned into her completely, nearly knocking them both over onto the couch. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Cariño! Beloved! What do you need? What can I do for you?” She cooed as she stroked her fingers through Agatha’s hair and rubbed a hand along her back. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Put me into a coma until Monday morning when I have to go back.” Agatha groaned into her shoulder. “I don’t think I’ve ever been this exhausted before in my life!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I would imagine not! It’s not like you’re doing anything terribly important like growing an entire human for instance!” Rio snickered</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ha! Exactly! And if that weren’t enough I swear I work with a bunch of incompetent morons and I’m including Herb in that statement! That asshole can never just stick to a decision! I finally had to put my foot down and say we’re a week out, we’ve been debating these fucking displays for weeks as this point they’re going to be what they’re going to be we just need to agree where we want them and install them otherwise this is never going to come together in time!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Is that what had you there so late?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Partly. That meeting ran over and then we still had to connect with the management team on staff headcount and figure out how to add four additional vendor booths so they can start assembling everything this weekend. Sorry I didn’t text you back, I didn’t see them until I got home.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s alright, I’m just glad you’re here now. Are you hungry?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Starving! They ordered pizza but it looked so greasy I knew it would just give me heartburn.” She mumbled, still clinging to Rio. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I made that lemon herbed chicken you like. With roasted potatoes and broccoli. You want some of that?” Rio offered as she squeezed her tight. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck it’s like you’ve read my mind! I’ve been craving that all day!” Agatha gasped as she straightened herself and headed towards the kitchen. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No no! You sit down, I’ll get it for you!” Rio insisted as she rushed past her, hobbling with one crutch. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio, please, you don’t have to do that! I don’t want you to hurt yourself trying to do more than you should!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha sit! I’ve got this, you need to get off your feet.” Rio commanded, leaving no room for argument. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha slowly moved to the stool to slide off her shoes with a sigh of relief as she did so. She let her eyes flutter closed as she started to release the tension she had been holding through the day and let herself bask in the stillness, the peace, the soft shuffling and clattering as Rio heated up her food. She had managed to survive the week but just barely. After a moment she stood back up, her joints creaking in protest as she wandered over to lie on the couch. As soon as she sunk into the soft cushions she felt the last of the tension dissipate as her body for the first time that day felt at ease. The pressure and weight of her son released a bit as her weight shifted to her side and she could feel him roll to settle with the new positioning. Scratchy quickly joined her, finding his favorite spot above her bump and curling into her as he purred loudly, grateful for her return. She felt calm and tired, so tired as she breathed slowly, deeply. She fought to keep her eyes open as she stroked Scratchy's fur but it was a battle she was losing. She quickly slipped into that light semiconsciousness, still aware of the movements around her but they felt distant, like a TV was on in another room. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Before she could drift too much further Rio hobbled over and placed her food onto the coffee table as she sat next to Agatha on the couch. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“My love,” she cooed as she stroked a hand along her cheek to wake her. “Your food’s ready.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha hummed as a smile grew across her lips but her eyes didn’t quite open. “Thank you sweetheart.” She lay there for another moment before she pried her bleary eyes open and pushed herself to sit. “This looks delicious!” She croaked wearily. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Is there anything else I can get you?” Rio asked with a worried furrow to her brow as she tucked a piece of hair behind Agatha’s ear. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Maybe a glass of water? Other than that this is perfect! Exactly what I needed!” She leaned over and pressed a kiss to Rio’s lips. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Right away, my love!” Rio hopped up onto her good leg and hobbled back to the kitchen to grab a water bottle. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How’s your knee feeling?” Agatha asked as she took a bite of food. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Much better than this morning! I’ve been staying on top of the anti inflammatories and icing off and on. The swelling’s gone down a lot!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Good! Now don’t push yourself too hard just because you’re feeling better!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh really? I shouldn’t push myself too hard?” Rio scoffed as she settled back onto the couch earning a side eye from Agatha. “Now where have I heard that before?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m pushing myself just far enough.” Agatha grumbled, taking another bite</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Cariño, you were practically dead on your feet when you walked through that door!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So today may have been a little much but I’m managing. There’s no need for you to worry!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You forgot to take your meds this morning.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Did I?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I checked after you called.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Why?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Because I’m worried about you! About what this job is doing to you right now! Pushing yourself this far, it has a cost!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh don’t worry I’m paying the price! My back and feet are killing me!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m interested to hear what Jen has to say tomorrow. I know Dr. Allen gave you the all clear but Jen knows better than she does what you’re really up to.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So I take it the party is still on for tomorrow then?” Agatha groaned, attempting to change the subject. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes. Plans have changed a bit. I’ve pushed it back to give us some more time to set up but the party is happening.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And what if I told you I’m too exhausted for a party?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’d tell you it’ll be worth it and you’ll get to have a whole spa day with Jen beforehand so I’m sure you’ll be well rested by the time you get back.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“When I tell you the bar you are setting for this party is in the stratosphere!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Then call me Neil Armstrong because I’m clearing that thing! I can promise you that!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ok Neil, can you get my bag for me?” Agatha chuckled. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You mean this bag?” She stretched herself over the arm of the couch to grab the bag by the door. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes, dear, thank you.” She dug around in her purse as Rio watched on curiously. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What are you looking for?” Rio asked after a few moments of searching. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Damn it! I swear I put them in here!” Agatha groaned as she started to take things out. “Ah! Here they are!” She pulled out a small envelope “Pictures from today. I figured you’d want to see them.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio could hardly contain her excitement. “Of him?” Agatha nodded as she finished her food. “Wait right here I’m gonna get the heart monitor!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Believe me, I’m going nowhere anytime soon!” Agatha groaned as she laid back onto the couch. After a few minutes of limping up and down the hallway Rio returned with the heart monitor and sat back down beside Agatha. “Up!” She insisted, pointing to Agatha’s shirt as she turned on the device. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I already did this once today, you know!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah and I missed it so please, for me!” Rio batted her big brown eyes and stuck out a pouty lip, looking as pitiful as she possibly could. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fine!” Agatha rolled her eyes as she lifted up her shirt. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yay!” Rio cheered as she opened the envelope and put the photos on the coffee table before her. She leaned over and kissed Agatha’s bump before pressing the device to the surface. Almost immediately the steady rhythm of the baby’s heartbeat echoed through the little speakers. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“There he is! Hey little guy! Sorry I missed you earlier. Luckily Mama was kind enough to bring me your pictures. Did you behave today or were you squirming around?” She asked as she leaned forward to look at the images. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“He stayed pretty still. I think he was trying to sleep and we were annoying him.” Agatha chuckled. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh my gosh he gets cuter every time! Look at his chubby little cheeks! I just wanna squish them!” She growled in delight. “Ah! Oh my gosh stop it!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What?” Agatha gasped</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Tell me he’s not sucking his little thumb in this one!” Rio exclaimed as she shoved the picture in Agatha’s face. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha smiled tiredly “Oh, yes. He was definitely sucking his thumb there.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I can’t believe I missed it! It’s the cutest thing I’ve ever seen!” Rio whispered in awe. “Thank you for bringing these back for me.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Of course, my love! I knew you were disappointed you had to miss it and really, I was quite sad that you weren’t there even if it was for the best. It’s a lot more overwhelming going to those things alone.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I know! I’m so sorry, Carino! I promise I’ll make it to the next one!” Rio assured</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha wagged her finger at Rio “No more injuring yourself please!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh absolutely not! This was pretty terrible and I feel like I missed out on so much!” She sighed before she returned her attention back to the photos. “Wow! He really looks like a real baby now! Like he could just pop out at any second!” Agatha’s gaze jumped to Rio as her heart skipped a beat. “I’m just so ready to see him up close, to actually meet him! Ugh! I’d just wish he’d hurry up and get here already!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“NO!” Agatha snapped, louder than either of them had anticipated. “Don’t say that!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio cowered in shock at the fierceness in her voice. “Agatha…I didn’t mean…”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m sure you were just trying to be funny but it’s not!” She continued as she pried herself  from the couch. “He’s staying right where he is until June!” and with that she stormed down the hallway and off to bed. Leaving Rio sitting in a stunned flurry of confusion and disquiet. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>—-------------------------------------------------</span></p><p> </p><p><span>The next morning, after a long and uncomfortable night, Agatha awoke to the smell of something sweet and cinnamony wafting in from the kitchen. She cracked a bleary eye open to find Scratchy sitting in the empty cavern of sheets on Rio’s side of the bed watching her intently, the blaring light of the sun glowing around him as if he was some sort of magnificent holy deity. Seeing she was finally awake he chirped at her as he moved to walk across her body, pressing his tiny pointy cat feet into her stomach, as he leapt off the bed and headed out of the room, fluffy tail swishing high and proud as he did so. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha rolled slowly to sit at the edge of the bed and stretch herself awake. She could already feel the hum of her son rolling within her as she moved to stand. She waddled over to grab her robe, feeling the stiff tightness in her hips, and knees, and feet, as she made her way down the hall. Rio, despite her injury, was hopping about the kitchen with latin jazz fusion playing softly in the background. The counters were covered with an array of breakfast foods and she was pulling another pan out of the oven. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How long have you been awake?” Agatha croaked as she settled onto a stool at the counter.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“AH! Good morning my beloved!” Rio lilted as she set down the pan and shuffled over to kiss Agatha on the cheek. “I think I got up around 6? How did you sleep?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Terribly! I don’t think either one of us could get comfortable last night.” She groaned as she rubbed circles along her stomach. “Why are you so chipper? Your leg feeling better?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Eh, it was pretty stiff this morning when I got up but it’s been feeling better since I put the brace on it. Also, it’s baby shower day, how could I not be excited!” She smiled brightly</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Eh, so it is. At least that’ll be over after today.” She groaned as she rolled her eyes. “Wait, is that clock right, or is that a timer?” She gasped as she looked at the stove.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, my love, it is indeed 10:00. You might want to think about getting dressed, Jen and Alice will be here any minute. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Why didn’t you wake me sooner!?” Agatha growled as she stormed off down the hallway.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You looked so peaceful!” Rio shouted after her. “Unlike right now.” She mumbled under her breath. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha hurried into her bathroom, stripping her clothes off along the way and jumped into the shower before the water even had the chance to warm up. She scrubbed head to toe as best she could, leaving her hair untouched in the messy bun that she had slept in. As soon as she stepped out, still dripping, she could hear Jen’s voice radiating from her kitchen. Quick as she could she slipped on some stretchy pants and an oversized button down that just fit over her belly before whipping her hair into a long braid down her back. Satisfied with the look she turned in a flash to head back down the hallway to the kitchen.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Finally! How good of you to grace us with your presence!” Jen scoffed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What can I say, perfection takes time, Jenny Kale!” Agatha sneered with a smirk</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And clearly you were on a time crunch!” Jen snickered to which Agatha glared at her. “You ready to do this, Harkness?” she asked as she grabbed her bag off the table.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, are you guys not eating with us?” Rio asked, clearly disappointed.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Our nail appointment is at 11 and I am going to need some caffeine in me if I’m going to be dealing with this one all day.” Jen huffed, pointing her thumb to Agatha.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m happy to make you some coffee! Pour over? French press?” Rio offered</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Latte?” Jen asked, raising her eyebrows in doubt.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It might not be coffee shop quality but I have a moka pot that’ll get you pretty close.” Rio insisted</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Come on Jen! Look at this feast! She went through all this trouble and you’re not even going to eat a bite?” Agatha asked, laying on the guilt thick as she plated herself a piece of french toast. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fine! Make it an iced moka whatever and you’ve got yourself a deal.” She agreed as she begrudgingly began filling a plate. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So what will you two be up to today?” Alice asked, grabbing some toast and eggs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Nails, massage, hair. The holy trinity.” Rio and Alice looked skeptically at each other. “Obviously the hair appointment is for her! Though I might try and find a wig for your opening gala.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So you are able to come?” Agatha asked, somewhat surprised.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, Alice and I will be there. I’ve been seeing the ads, hate to say it but it looks like it’ll be a good time.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It better be for how much work has gone into this shit!” Agatha snorted</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I keep hearing that there’s different themes, am I supposed to wear something specific?” Alice asked.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s entirely up to you! Each weekend is modeled after one of the four elements. Fire, Water, Earth, and Air. The musical selections align with the theme. The art, performers, and displays will change with the themes. It’s been an undertaking to say the least.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And you’re managing all of this?” Jen asked with a skeptical glance. “All four weekends?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s what they’re paying me for!” Agatha snapped back</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Huh…interesting.” Jen frowned amusedly.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What?” Agatha growled</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Nothing, it's just, it sounds interesting.” Jen shrugged though the way her eyes rolled hinted that it was more than just that. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“One iced caramel latte for the lady!” Rio chimed in, breaking the awkward tension. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You really lucked out with this one didn’t you, Harkness! I mean, for someone who can’t cook an egg, this is really ideal.” Jen snickered, gesturing to the feast before them as she took a sip of her coffee.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I can cook an egg just fine! Though I will admit, Rio has a talent for it.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I hear that’s not the only thing she has a talent for!” Jen cackled</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha’s face contorted into a fit of rage. “I call you one time in a moment of weakness thinking my water broke and you’re going to hold it over me!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“For the rest of your life, Harkness! That shit was funny as hell! Alice and I still laugh about it!” Agatha whipped around to glare at Alice as she diverted her attention to her plate. “Oh come on, even I can admit that was funny despite how scarring it was at the time!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio!” Agatha growled, seeing her snicker.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What do you want me to say? It was pretty funny if you think about it.” Rio shrugged</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don’t know why I put up with any of you people!” Agatha growled as she stormed off into her room. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>‘Because you love me!” Rio called after her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Because who else would tolerate any of your bullshit.” Jen huffed under her breath as she took a sip of coffee. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Almost as soon as she had left Agatha returned, shoes on and carrying her bag. “Alright Jennifer, let’s do this before I change my mind.” She grumbled as she sauntered through the living room and out the front door. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Jen turned to Rio as she went to grab her purse. “Can I get this in a to-go up. This was actually really good!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh yeah! No worries. Glad you liked it.” Rio took the glass and poured the contents into a green thermos covered in dinosaur images. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I am not even going to ask.” Jen huffed as she grabbed the mug and started to head out after Agatha. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Jen wait!” Rio called just as her hand touched the door. “Can you make sure she takes this? She keeps forgetting.” Rio asked as she tossed Jen the bottle of pills. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Jeez it like taking care of a toddler!” Jen mumbled as she caught the bottle. “Yeah I got it!” She hollered before heading out. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>As soon as the door shut behind her Alice turned to Rio, “Are you ready to do this?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Abso-fucking-lutely! Grab the streamers!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>—--------------------------------------------</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Any day now Jennifer!” Agatha huffed as she stood impatiently beside the car. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Cool it! I’m getting there! The door’s unlocked by the way.” Jen grumbled as she made her way down the porch steps. Agatha quickly settled into the car with Jen sliding in just after her. “Forget something?” Jen teased as she shook the bottle of pills Rio had given her. Agatha snatched the bottle of pills and poured one into her hand before grabbing Jen’s coffee just as she was about to take a sip. “Hey!” Jen protested as Agatha chugged a good bit of the coffee before handing it back to her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright, Kale, let’s get this show on the road!” She grumbled. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You drank like half of it! You’re buying me another one after this!” Jen said as she turned on the car and pulled out of the driveway. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Whatever you say Jennifer!” Agatha huffed as she rolled her eyes. As they drove, Agatha sat, silently annoyed, scrolling on her phone. About ten minutes into their journey, after having finished what was left of her iced Dino latte, Jen tempted to get the conversation started. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So…” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Did you ever read over that shit I sent you?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I may have perused it.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And what?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Any thoughts?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“On what?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Bitch! On your fucking birth plan?!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Again I ask, what’s there to plan?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fine! I’ll start with the easy one. Do you want pain meds?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Obviously! Do you really think I wanna feel this kid split my vagina in half?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Some people do it naturally, that’s why I asked.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And they’re insane for that!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright, do you want anyone in the room?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Just Rio…and you I guess.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio cutting the cord?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“If she wants to.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh I bet she does! You open to visitors after?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck no!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fair enough. Are you fine with getting pitocin if the labor stalls?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“If it what?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“If you’ve been in labor for over 24 hours and it’s not going anywhere do you want drugs to help or just wait it out? To be clear, this is assuming everything’s fine with the baby, otherwise you’re getting a c-section.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Please, if I’m in labor for more than 10 hours just take the kid out the sunroof.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Girl, 10 hours is nothing! Especially for your first child. We had a woman last week that went 36 hours unmedicated before she gave birth.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck! Is she still alive?!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And happy with her 10 pound baby!” Agatha glared at her horrified. “I’m trying to tell you girl, this shit is wild!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Can she fucking walk?” Agatha gasped</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh yeah! She was up and moving about a couple hours later.” Jen chuckled as she pulled into a parking space. She turned off the car and went to grab her bag then stopped suddenly, turning to Agatha with a wicked grin. “Have you ever seen anyone give birth?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No.” Agatha replied cautiously</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“OOOOO, we’re about to change that!” Jen cackled.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>—---------------------------------------</span></p><p> </p><p><span>It was just about 11 at the Harkness abode when the doorbell rang.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Come in!” Alice and Rio shouted in unison. The door cracked open and Nat, Yelena, and Hela stumbled in, hands full of food and things for the baby, looking as if they barely survived the night before. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What the hell happened to you three?” Rio chuckled</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Somebody thought it was a good idea to order a pitcher of margaritas last night.” Hela groaned as she set her stuff down on the table and pushed her sunglasses to the top of her head.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And then another once that one was cleared.” Nat grumbled, setting the food down on the counter as she slumped into the stool.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Not my fault these two can’t keep up anymore.” Yelena snickered as she set down her bags.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How do you not feel like garbage right now?!” Nat asked as her head sunk to the counter.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I took some advil and drank two bottles of water before bed like you’re supposed to.” she shrugged</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“There’s some advil in the bathroom cabinet above the sink if you want some.” Rio offered. “I also have some left over breakfast if you need food to cure the hangover.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes! All of it! I need bacon in my mouth right now, and toast!” Nat groaned, unable to raise her head.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’ll get the advil.” Hela sighed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m liking the streamers! You want me to start blowing up balloons?” Yelena asked</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah! That’d be great! And anything you brought for the baby just pop in the room.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You got it!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“When are other people showing up?” Nat grumbled, slowly raising her head from the counter as Rio handed her a plate of food.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“We have about an hour to get things together. Lilia might be here before then though and she’s bringing her cookies.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh hell yeah! The ones with the frosting? Those are the shit!” Yelena cheered</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So what exactly are we doing now? You said Agatha’s not coming?” Hela asked, returning with the bottle of advil.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, this isn’t really her thing so instead, we’re gonna party, play some games, and put the baby’s room together before she gets home.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Odd, but to each their own!” Hela shrugged. “What do you need from me?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m going to put you in charge of setting up the food.” Rio instructed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Should I be doing something?” Nat asked as she choked down a piece of toast. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Just focus on not throwing up for now. I’ll find something for you later.” Rio chuckled</span></p><p> </p><p><span>—---------------------------------------------</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“AH! AHHH! What the fuck Jen!” Agatha screamed out in the nail salon, slamming the phone down on the table between them as Jen cackled in the pedicure chair beside her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That was a third degree tear. She almost needed an episiotomy. You can see how his shoulder kind of got stuck there for a second.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Do I even want to know about the episiotomy?” Agatha asked, face as white as a sheet</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Not unless you need one so you better pray you don’t!” Jen snickered as she grabbed her phone to pull up another video.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“NO! Please! I need a fucking break! That…that was…”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Not what you expected, I take it.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“SOOooo much worse than I expected. Did she feel all of that?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She had an epidural so no, not really. At least, not in the moment. Later for sure! People tend to tear more when they get an epidural because they can’t gauge what’s going on down there. Another reason some people prefer natural.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha sat in silence, staring aimlessly at the wall in front of her as images of the video replayed in her mind. If she had been nervous about giving birth before now she was absolutely dreading it. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Remind me why I decided to do this again.” She mumbled, still in a horrified daze</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Girl! I have no fucking clue! Something about wanting to be somebody’s mama. Here, watch this.” Jen said, handing the phone back to Agatha. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh no! What the hell is this going to be?” Agatha groaned as she reluctantly took the phone. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“This one’s a c-section. Enjoy!” Jen giggled maniacally </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh FUCK! Jen why?!!” Agatha groaned. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>—----------------------------------------------------</span></p><p> </p><p><span>At 11:45 the doorbell rang.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Come in!” Shouted Alice, Hela, and Nat who were spread out amongst the living room preparing different games. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Buongiorno, belle signore!” greeted Lilia as she pushed her way into the house. “Any chance I could trouble one of you to help me grab the rest of the things from my van?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“For sure!” Hela said hopping up and grabbing the platter Lilia was carrying before she followed her outside. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Do you think those are the cookies?” Alice whispered to Nat, eyeing the covered platter. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Only one way to find out!” Nat smirked as they put down the games and tip-toed over to the table. Nat placed a hand on the cover of the tray and slowly lifted it up to reveal the ornately decorated cookies. “Do you think she’ll notice if we take one now?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“There’s like 40 of them, I doubt it!” Alice shrugged as she reached for one. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well if you’re taking one then I’m definitely taking one!” Nat said as she snuck one off the plate. “Cheers!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>They tapped their cookies together and just as they were about to take a bite, “Hold it right there!” Lilia shouted from the doorway. Nat and Alice froze, mouths still open as they turned to face her. “Put the cookies down!” They both tucked their heads and reluctantly returned the cookies before shuffling off back to their games. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Is Lilia here?” Rio called out as she hobbled down the hallway on a crutch.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Indeed I am! AH! Just look at you!” She said, clicking her tongue in disapproval. “This is what you get for fooling around!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I wasn’t fooling around! Some guy clobbered me!” Rio protested as she shuffled over to hug Lilia. “Thanks for coming!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Anything for you, doll! So, where’s the guest of honor?” Lilia asked as she started unpacking the boxes Hela had carried in.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, she won’t be here.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I texted you last night! She really doesn’t want to do this so I’m not going to force her into anything.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Good for you! Are you still planning to um…” she asked cautiously as she glanced around the room.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, later after I show her the room. Did you bring it?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Of course, dear! It’s in my bag!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“AH! You’re the best! What all did you bring?” She asked, seeing the array of containers now spread about the table. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“In Italy it’s considered bad luck to buy any gifts for the baby before it’s born so instead I cooked a bunch of food to throw in your freezer. I also have a few things for Agatha.”  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh my gosh! That’s perfect!” Rio gasped</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Do you have a moment to help me put it away?” Lilia asked, with a mischievous glimmer in her eye.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, can do!” Rio replied with a questioning frown.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So how’s Agatha doing?” Lilia asked as she followed Rio further into the kitchen with the food containers. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She’s been doing alright. Working a lot, kind of grumpy, but you have to expect that at this point. I’m trying not to take it personally.” Rio explained as she rearranged a few things in the freezer to make room</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Good! I’m glad you have a level head about it. How’s she feeling otherwise? Everything alright with the baby?” Lilia asked as she handed over the first of the dishes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“According to Agatha everything’s going alright. She had an appointment yesterday that I had to miss, unfortunately, but apparently the doctor says everything looks alright and her blood pressure is under control.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s good to hear.” Lilia said as she handed over another dish. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“But she has forgotten or has almost forgotten to take her medication the last couple of days. It’s driving me crazy so I’m trying to stay on top of her about it.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She’s lucky to have you dear!” Lilia replied with a caring smile. “What about you?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What about me?” Rio asked as she shoved a dish to the back of the freezer</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How have you been feeling dear? Outside of your injury that is.” Lilia asked, her eyes probing Rio carefully. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio sighed as she considered. “A bit nervous to be honest. We’re nearly in the home stretch and I just hope that we’re ready.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ah, that’s to be expected. Tell me, have you been able to rest much since I saw you on Sunday?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“A bit.” Rio replied tentatively “More so these last couple of nights with the pain meds.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And before that?” Lilia continued, treading lightly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I had a few rough nights there.” Rio said though she eyed Lilia skeptically</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Any more nightmares?” She asked, still trying to sound casual as she handed her the last of the dishes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Really?” Rio droned, her face falling flat, unamused. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes, really!” Lilia urged as she crossed her arms and leaned against the counter. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ugh! Fine!” Rio huffed as she slammed the freezer door shut behind her. “Nearly every night after I saw you until I fucked up my knee.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“About Agatha and the baby?” Lilia asked, raising her eyebrows as if it was a question she already knew the answer to. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Why am I not surprised?” Rio breathed exasperatedly “Yes about Agatha and the baby, so what?” She threw her hands up in surrender before slapping them against her legs. “It doesn’t mean anything! It’s just my subconscious overreacting to my anxieties about the baby coming. It’s nothing.” She shrugged as Lilia stared at her pointedly. “It’s nothing!” She growled a little more forcefully. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m sure you’re right dear!” Lilia replied with a tight smile as she patted Rio on the cheek and continued moving about the kitchen not saying a word.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What?” Rio groaned</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Nothing dear, I didn’t say a thing!” Lilia smiled though the twinkle in her eye glimmered brightly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“But you’re clearly thinking something! What is it?” Rio pressed, inching closer to her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s nothing! I’m sure, like you said.” She shrugged as she started out of the kitchen. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Lilia!” Rio growled as she caught her elbow. “I know you know something! You’re doing that thing!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What thing?” Lilia replied, her hand clasped to her chest as if she was shocked by the question. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh don’t give me that! You know exactly what I’m talking about. Asking questions you clearly already know some answer to. And don’t think I didn’t see that look you gave me at lunch the other day! Spill it!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Lilia chewed on her lip as she chose her words carefully. “In truth dear I don’t quite know. It’s all very fuzzy at the moment. Almost as if the universe is at a crossroads, too many paths to choose from.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ok? And what does that have to do with anything?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’ve tried to follow them, the ones I can make out and…”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And what?” Rio probed, growing irritated and anxious. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’ve seen it, I know you have. It’s not what I would hope for you, any of you to say the least.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ok? Let’s pretend for one second that I’m buying any of this, what the hell am I supposed to do with that ominous warning?” Rio scoffed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“All I can say is stay close to her, stay prepared and when you lose her in the red sea look for the silver lining.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Lilia, what the absolute fuck are you talking about?!” Rio spat, “How high are you right now? Are you microdosing again?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No! Dear I…” just as she started the doorbell rang. She smiled softly as she continued. “Better get that dear, don’t want to keep your guest waiting. It is a party after all.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio started towards the door but her gaze never left Lilia. “Don’t for one second think this conversation is over!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>————————————————-</span></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><span>“So you know when to go into the hospital right?” Jen grilled Agatha as they drove to their next appointment. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes! When my water breaks.” Agatha spat back at her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well yes, if your water breaks then definitely head in, even if you aren’t having contractions, but it might not break on its own. Otherwise you want to head in when your contractions are consistently 3-5 minutes apart.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That feels like cutting it a little close.” Agatha frowned</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh you’ll have more time than you think. I keep trying to tell you this is not a quick process! But who knows, you may get lucky and only suffer for like 5 hours and then he’s here. Everybody’s different and every pregnancy is different.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ugh! If only! Something tells me he isn’t going to make this too easy.” Agatha said as she rubbed her hand against the surface of her stomach trying to ease his pressing and kicking at her side. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You think?” Jen scoffed “He is your son, I guarantee you whatever happens it’s going to be as dramatic as possible.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I wouldn’t expect anything less!” Agatha chuckled as they pulled into a space. Jen turned off the car and grabbed her purse, and as Agatha leaned forward to grab her bag she felt the familiar aching tightening begin to coil in her lower back. She breathed in sharply as she leaned back into the seat to let the wave of pressure roll through her, her hand gripping tightly to the side of the door. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You coming?” Jen yelled as she stood on the sidewalk, arms crossed in front of the car. Agatha glared at her as she breathed slowly in and out through her nose, the claws of the contraction beginning to release. As the last of the pressure finally eased she slowly began to move and ease out of the car, still feeling the shadow of the pain that had been there just a moment before. “You good?” Jen snickered as Agatha shut the door behind her and waddled over, still feeling a tightness in her hips. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Perfectly fine.” She grunted, pretending to brush off the contraction that had just stopped her in her tracks as she breezed past Jen. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You just had a contraction didn’t you?” Jen asked, not fooled by her nonchalance. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Just Braxton Hicks, it’s fine.” She huffed as she threw her braid over her shoulder. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’ve been getting a lot of those lately?” Jen queried, her eyebrows stitched in skeptical amusement. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“On and off throughout the day.” Agatha sighed as she opened the door to the spa. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are they always that intense?” Jen asked as she followed her in. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Jeez Jen! What are you, my doctor?” Agatha scoffed as she approached the desk. “Harkness, I have an appointment at 1.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Um yeah, bitch, I’m technically on your birth team.” Jen scoffed </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Jen, please! We’re in a place of business! Be professional for once!” Agatha scolded teasingly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Girl! Miss me with that bullshit! What did Vicky say at your appointment yesterday?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That everything looks fine.” Agatha shrugged. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Jen’s face fell into deadpan judgement. “That’s all she said, everything’s fine?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ms. Harkness?” Called the masseuse</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ooo, Jen, sorry! Wish I could elaborate but I have to go!” Agatha shrugged with a wry smirk as she followed the technician down the hallway. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t think I won’t find out!” Jen called after her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>————————————————</span></p><p> </p><p><span>As the doorbell rang again Rio hobbled over to receive the last of her guests. “Sharon!” She shouted gleefully. “Oh my gosh! I’m so glad you made it! Come on in!” She insisted as she shuffled out of the way to let Sharon by. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh of course dear! I was so thrilled that you invited me. There was no way I was going to miss it! Oh goodness! What happened?” She asked eyeing the crutch and brace.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>”Oh it’s nothing! Just a sprain, you should see the other guy!” Rio laughed. “Don’t be shy, go grab yourself a plate. Anything you brought feel free to throw in the baby’s room down the hall. We’re going to play a few games here in a bit.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh how wonderful! Do you mind if I just set this down here for now? I have a few more things to grab from the car.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>”Yeah, no worries, do you need any help?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>”Oh, don’t worry about it dear, I’m not going to make you wander all the way out to my car! I’ll be back in a jiffy.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>”Nonsense! Alice! Yelena!” Rio called as she beckoned them from across the room. “Alice you know Sharon.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sharon this is my friend Yelena. Sharon is Agatha’s assistant, she also helps me keep an eye on her when she’s at work. Makes sure she isn’t pushing herself too far.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>”Nice to meet you” Yelena beamed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Would you mind helping her bring some things in from her car? Then we’ll plan to get started.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah of course!” Alice chimed.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>As they shuffled back out the door Rio took a moment and glanced around the room observing the clusters of gathered friends eating and engaged in conversation. Her heart was full with the warmth and love that filled the room but even she had to admit, Yelena had been right. This party was for her, her joy, her excitement about the new life she was eagerly awaiting. She had needed this more than she realized as she counted down the days until she could hold him in her arms. It was a welcomed relief from the anxieties that had plagued her and despite Lilia’s warning she was determined to push it from her mind for the time being and enjoy herself. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Minutes later Sharon returned with Alice and Yelena in tow, both their arms full of bags and boxes, and Sharon gleefully carrying a small wooden rocking horse. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh my gosh! Sharon you didn’t have to do all this!” Rio insisted as she held the door for them. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh I know, but I couldn’t help myself! I’m just so excited for you both! I may have gotten a little carried away. Where did you say you’d like me to put things?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh we’re setting everything up in the baby’s room down the hall. Alice and Yelena will show you and help you get everything set up.” Rio beamed before turning to the rest of her guests. “Alright folks! As you finish your food make sure you write something in the baby book for Agatha and don’t forget to place your baby bets with Lilia! We’ll have winners for birthdate, height and weight, and if you have any guesses on the name feel free to throw it down! Your guess is as good as mine at this point! In about ten minutes we’ll start the games and I challenge any one of you to change a better diaper than me!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>—————————————————</span></p><p> </p><p><span>After a particularly silent post massage car ride Jen and Agatha finally made it to the hairdresser. As Agatha gathered her things to head inside Jen sat stoically typing on her phone. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Something the matter Jen?” Agatha snipped as she slid out of the vehicle. “You’ve been unusually quiet.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Jen shook her head “No, no, everything’s fine!” She said dryly as she continued to text away on her phone. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well are you coming in then?” Agatha grumbled as she leaned against the car door. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You go on ahead, I’ll be in in a minute. I’ve got to make a call.” Jen muttered, refusing to look at Agatha. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha narrowed her gaze suspiciously, “If you say so.” She huffed and closed the door, not blinking twice as she headed inside. </span></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><span>Nearly 20 minutes later Jen sauntered in with a smug look on her face as she settled into a chair near to Agatha. Agatha glanced in her direction but spoke no word of acknowledgment as the hairdresser, unaware of the tension babbled on. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“…And then with my second kid I worked until he practically walked out of me. My water broke over near the color station and luckily my husband doesn’t work far from here so Gloria gave him a call and he rushed over. But then he typed the wrong hospital into the map so it routed us like an hour away instead of the one 20 minutes down the road and I ended up giving birth in the hospital parking lot. I just remember a bunch of nurses rushing out and I’m laying there in the passenger seat with the kid on my chest like what the fuck just happened. The whole thing was so wild! This is your first kid though right?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“First and only at this point. There’s no way I’m ever doing this again!” Agatha chuckled though her gaze was fixed on Jen who was eying her suspiciously in the corner. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, has it been a rough pregnancy? I remember with my first I was so horribly nauseous pretty much the whole time and I told myself I was never going to do it again but here I am now three kids later. You forget the worst of it honestly and they’re so sweet, for the most part. I swear once they start talking it makes you miss the baby phase and you start thinking about having another.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’ll see. It took a bit to get to this point and I don’t know that I’d go through all of that again.” Agatha sighed to which Jen snickered in the corner. “Something funny Jennifer?” Agatha snipped</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What, you don’t want to surprise yourself again?” Jen chuckled </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s not what I’m talking about and you know it!” Agatha bit back. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Surprise? Was it unexpected?” Asked the hairdresser. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You could say that.” Agatha sighed as she glowered at Jen. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Please! You’d been trying for what was it, three years, and when it finally worked it took you what five months to realize? And not even that your girlfriend had to tell you!” Jen cackled. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha clenched her teeth in frustration, “It was a unique situation but yes I don’t want to repeat that either!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh wow! So you like didn’t have any symptoms or anything?” The hairdresser asked in awe</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh she had symptoms, she just didn’t put two and two together.” Jen snickered </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I took two pregnancy tests and they both came back negative, what was I supposed to think?” Agatha sighed as she threw her hands out to the side in exasperation. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh shit! That happened to my cousin but she didn’t figure it out until she went in for appendicitis and came out with a baby!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“See! It happens! At least I figured it out before I gave birth!” Agatha snorted as she pointed a finger at Jen. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“At least Rio figured it out you mean.” Jen said with a wry smirk. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How much longer until you’re on maternity leave?” Asked the hairdresser. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’ve just got to make it through May. That festival I was telling you about goes through the end of the month then I should be in the clear.” Agatha explained </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Cutting it a little close don’t you think?” Jen snickered from her seat.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well I’m not due until June so that shouldn’t be a problem!” Agatha spat back</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh really? Is that what your doctor said?” Jen pressed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes, Jennifer!” Agatha growled. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You sure about that?” Jen narrowed her gaze pointedly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes, Jennifer!” Agatha huffed sharply, growing more irritated by the minute. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ok, Agatha.” Jen relented as she rolled her eyes and pursed her lips dubiously. </span></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><span>———————————————-</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright guys!” Rio shouted over the clamoring of her guests. “Jen just text me and said she and Agatha are headed home, so unfortunately our fun has come to an end!” She announced receiving a series of disappointed groans. “Really, truly, I cannot thank you all enough for coming and indulging me in my silly games and for all the wonderful gifts you brought. It means so much to me and though she might not admit it herself I know how much this is going to mean to Agatha! Please make sure to take food and cookies on your way out!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>In a flurry everyone shuffled to gather their things and clean up what mess they had made in the various games as they began to make their way towards the door. Sharon, in her flustered urgency nearly knocked Rio over as she b-lined for the exit. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Woah Sharon! Damn, were you a linebacker in a previous life? What a hit!” Rio chuckled as she steadied herself on the table. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh dear! I’m so sorry! Just trying to make sure I’m out of the way. Ah-ha-ha! Thanks again for inviting me! I love parties and I haven’t been to one this fun in ages!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well don’t worry! You’re at the top of my guest list for the next one! Oh don’t forget your trophy!” Rio said as she quickly grabbed a small golden statue. “I thought I had it clenched but you really pulled it out with those diaper changes. Mind if I put you on the roster for babysitting?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh that would be just lovely! Yes please anytime day or night! I just love babies!” Sharon grinned. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You got it! Take care! I’m sure I’ll see you at the festival next week!” Rio said as she waved her out the door. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright I think we’ve got everything!” Hela grumbled as she, Nat, and Yelena made their way to the door. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Thank you guys so much for driving all the way out here for this! Really I couldn’t have done all of this without you!” Rio sighed with a grateful smile. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Of course man! We wouldn’t have missed it for anything!” Nat said as she leaned in for a hug. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You guys still up to meet for brunch tomorrow? I’m sure Agatha would like to see you while you’re still in town.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh absolutely! 10 still work?” Yelena asked</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, it sounds like a plan!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Cool then we’ll see you then! Good luck!” Yelena winked as she closed the door behind them. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Lilia…” Rio groaned as she let the woman pull her into a hug. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh don’t give me that! Good job today sweetheart! The room looks lovely, I’m sure she’s going to be thrilled when she gets home.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Thank you.” Rio muttered as Lilia stepped back, her arms still braced on Rio’s shoulders as she looked her over. “What now?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Nothing dear! Just admiring the woman you’ve become. So strong, brilliant, and caring. I’m so proud of you!” She cracked a smile as her eyes began to mist and she brought her hands up to cup Rio’s cheeks. “You’ve got this! Whatever lies ahead, just trust yourself, ok?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio frowned in confused unamusement “Ok…? Promise me you’ll lay off the mushrooms.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I swear I’ve sworn off the things!” She groaned, giving a playful slap to Rio’s shoulder as she picked up her bag. “I put your box on the dresser in the baby’s room so you should be all set. Just remember what I said and I’ll see you both before long.” She said as she pointed her finger and was out the door with a wink. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio let out a deep sigh as the door closed behind her. She was relieved for how the party had gone, the joy and camaraderie soothing the noxious anxieties that had been weighing on her these past days, but as the excitement quickly dissipated she could feel her nerves begin to prickle at the thought of Agatha’s return. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How you feeling?” Alice called out to her from the kitchen. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Like I’m going to be sick, or maybe my heart is going to explode.” Rio groaned as she pressed her palms into her face. “I hate this part, the waiting. My mind likes to think of every horrible outcome when it has nothing to do.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well then come help me put away the leftovers. I’m sure by the time everything’s packed away they’ll be pulling up.” Alice said as she beckoned her over. “Are we taking down the streamers and balloons and stuff?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No those can stay. It’ll still be a celebration, hopefully.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t sweat it! I’m sure it will!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>———————————————-</span></p><p> </p><p><span>At 4:00 on the dot Jen’s car pulled into Agatha’s driveway. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So…does Rio know?” Jen asked as she turned off the vehicle.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Does Rio know what?” Agatha replied, pretending to be aloof.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha…I know what Vicky told you. He’s going to be here before the end of May. Don’t you think Rio deserves to know?” Jen prodded</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“We don’t know that for sure! She only said he might!” Agatha sneered</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You can’t be serious!” Jen scoffed, “The chances of you making it to June, especially with you working like this are like 20% at most. You need to get it together!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I am together! I have everything together! I’ve been planning for months for it all to fall together perfectly and it will! I have just enough time to do what I need to do and then he’ll be here!” Agatha shrugged as she aggressively grabbed her things from the car. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha it doesn’t fucking work like that! It’s not really up to you!” Jen scolded</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t you think I know that!” Agatha snapped, “I don’t need a lecture from you Jen! Now, if you don’t mind, I have to go pretend to be excited about this stupid party my lovely girlfriend planned.” With that she slammed the car door and stormed off towards the house. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>As she ascended the steps she took a deep breath in and did her best to shake off the argument with Jen. She didn’t need that kind of negativity! Not now, when she was struggling so hard to be excited about whatever Rio had conjured behind the door. She took another calming breath in through her nose and out through her mouth before plastering a strained smile across her face. Then, as her hand reached for the door, it suddenly shot open.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh hey Agatha!” Alice lilted cheerily. “Jen still in the car?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I assume so, she’s not here is she?” Agatha droned as she glanced over her shoulder. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No she is not! Well, I’ll just go and check on her then, if you’ll excuse me.” Alice said as she snuck around her, grinning awkwardly at the tension hovering in the air. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>As soon as she was past Agatha pushed open the door and stepped inside. The house, though adorned with streamers and balloons and confetti, was eerily silent and empty, save for Rio leaning nervously against the counter dressed in a clean white button down and black slacks. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hello, my love. Did you have a good day?” Rio hummed though her voice was shaky with nerves. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It was pleasant…” Agatha started as she looked around cautiously. “Rio, I swear, if a bunch of people try to pop out and surprise me I’m going to strangle you!” She grumbled.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No.” Rio giggled “No one is here, it’s just us.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha frowned in confusion. “I thought you said the party was pushed back to 4?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That may have been a fib.” Rio cringed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“A fib?” Agatha’s eyebrows raised in surprise.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“A little white lie. The truth is everyone has already come and gone.” Rio explained sheepishly.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ok…then what’s happening?” Agatha asked, still unsure of what Rio was up to.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Follow me.” She said as she took Agatha’s hand and began to hobble down the hallway.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You sure you’re ok to walk without the crutches?” Agatha asked skeptically</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m fine, I’ve got the brace on and it’s just a few feet.” She said as she stopped in front of the baby’s room. “You ready?” She asked, almost unable to contain her excitement. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“For what?” Agatha huffed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio grasped the doorknob and slowly creaked the door open to reveal the room. Everything was bathed in the warm glow of the afternoon sun as light trickled in through the windows on the far end. The dark wooden floor was covered in a plush ornate rug, its gold and coffee colored patterns blending nicely with the sage green walls. A mobile displaying different bugs and insects hung delicately above the crib along the left side of the wall, with a matching quilt hung along the rail. Beside that was a tiny wooden rocking horse and matching wooden toy chest filled to the brim with various books and toys. On the walls hung various colorful illustrations of bugs and insects like those out of a vintage entomology book. In the corner sat a cream colored gliding recliner and ottoman with a soft sage crochet blanket draped along the arm and a cozy standing lamp hovering behind. Along the other wall was an old hoosier cabinet that had been transformed into a changing table and in the corner near the closet was a tall wooden dresser, above which hung framed ultrasound photos. Agatha hovered at the doorway, her mouth agape in awe as she took in every detail.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So? What do you think?” Rio asked as she stepped into the room, pulling Agatha in behind her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio, it’s…it’s…I don’t even know what to say!” Agatha gasped as her eyes darted around the room. She stepped carefully, her hand hovering along the edge of the crib as she passed, too afraid to touch anything as if it might all disappear the moment she did. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Go ahead, check it out!” Rio insisted as Agatha approached the chair. Agatha let out a soft chuckle then eased her way into the recliner. The plush cushions welcomed her aching body and she felt herself melt as the chair rocked gently back and forth. She could imagine herself here in the wee hours of the morning holding him close, soothing him back to sleep. “Comfy huh?” Rio smiled “Not going to lie, I totally took a nap in that yesterday when I was getting everything together. I knew you’d love it!” she beamed as she reached out a hand. “I hate to make you get up but there are a few other things I want to show you.” She pulled Agatha out of the chair and walked her over to the changing table. “This thing is awesome! Yelena helped me put it together, everything you need just within reach!” She said as she pulled out drawers and opened the cabinet doors revealing the carefully organized diapers and wipes and other baby accoutrement. “And then over here I have all of his little outfits organized!” She said as she pulled out drawer after drawer of the dresser. “And we should be good on diapers for at least a month!” Rio chuckled as she opened the closet to reveal it stuffed to the brim with cases of diapers in different sizes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha had followed her silently, too stunned to speak seeing the care an effort Rio had gone through to pull the whole room together. It was more than she could have ever asked for or expected and Rio had gifted it to her willingly. The relief she felt that it was done his room was ready, the joy she felt at seeing all the tiny pieces in their place, the gratitude she had for the magnificent woman standing before her, it was all too much in the best possible way and she could feel the tears welling in her eyes.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio…this is…it's perfect!” She choked out just as the first tears began to fall. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m so glad you love it, carino!” Rio beamed. “But you haven’t even seen the best part!” Rio hobbled over to close the blackout curtains and turn off the lamp before scurrying back to Agatha’s side. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What are you up to now?” Agatha chuckled as she wiped the tears from her eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Really it’s the best part in my opinion.” Rio grinned. “Look up!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes fluttered as she tilted her head to look at the ceiling. Glowing back at her were little hand painted stars and constellations shimmering in the darkness as if she were staring at the night sky. Immediately a stream of tears trickled from her eyes. “When? How?” She sobbed as she walked around looking at every detail.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I have to admit, this took a few weeks but I think it was worth it.” Rio admitted as she crept around the room.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“This…this is unbelievable! It’s beautiful! Rio, I…” As she glanced down her train of thought was immediately broken. There sitting somewhat awkwardly on the ottoman was Rio with a small satin box in her hand. “What are you doing?” She breathed though the air got stuck in her throat. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I was really hoping to get on my knee for this but the brace is making it a little difficult so I hope you’ll forgive me.” Rio started</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, Rio no, you don’t have to do this!” Agatha mumbled in a panic.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I know!” Rio chuckled nervously, “Agatha, from the moment I ran into you in that bookstore I knew my life had changed forever. I mean, what are the chances the most beautiful, perfect, brilliant, enchanting woman would literally fall into my arms? But there you were and I knew this was something different. In more ways than I realized at the time, but each and every day I’ve only grown to love you more and more. Being near you it’s as if I’ve captured pure sunlight, your glow, your radiance, it warms parts of me that I hadn’t even realized were cold. And this life that we’re building, that you’re creating, is so precious to me, I can’t imagine a moment passing without it. So, if you’ll let me, I want to do all that I can, for the rest of my days, to make you the happiest woman in the universe. Agatha Harkness, will you marry me?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>From the moment Rio had started a stream of steady tears was pouring down Agatha’s cheeks. She could feel herself shaking, biting her lip as she did her best to hold it together until the end of Rio’s speech and when the words finally came she could feel her heart nearly explode under the weight of Rio’s love. She wanted to shout but in the heat of the moment, as the tears rushed out, her voice escaped her. So instead with a vigorous nod she pulled Rio into her arms. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m guessing this is a yes then?” Rio chuckled over her shoulder.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>With that laugh the weight of the moment lifted off of her and she pulled Rio back to cup her face in her hands. “Yes! Yes! It’s definitely a yes!” She cried as she pulled Rio’s lips into hers, consuming her with every fiber of her being. They stood there, locked at the lips, both crying tears of joy until the sound of the doorbell broke the spell. “I thought you said the party was over.” Agatha panted as she rested her forehead against Rio’s.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It is…” Rio huffed, “But I have one last surprise I think you’ll enjoy.” She smirked as she pulled away from Agatha and hobbled back down the hallway to the door with Agatha closely behind. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“If this is Jen and Alice, tell them to come back tomorrow!” Agatha huffed as she approached the door.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Trust me! I know better!” Rio laughed as she swung the door open. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Heyyy mama!” Ralph lilted in the doorway</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“RALPH! What the hell?! I thought you were in the Virgin Islands until August!” Agatha shouted as she pulled him into a hug.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I renegotiated my contract. I’ll be staying with them until October in exchange for a couple of months off now while we wait for this little guy to get here. You didn’t really think I’d miss it did you?” He laughed as he pushed his way into the house. “Besides I hear there’s a killer festival coming up next week, you know how I love a festival!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I…I just can’t believe you’re really here! How did you do this?” Agatha gasped as she shoved Rio playfully</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Surprise! I asked him about it when we sent over the documents from Valentina.” Rio shrugged</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Which I have for you by the way!” He chimed in as he plopped himself on the couch.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ah! Amazing! Thank you!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck I love you so much!” Agatha moaned as she launched herself at Rio.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey! Hey! I’m still here!” Ralph groaned as Agatha pressed her up against the back of the couch. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sorry, Ralph, got a little carried away!” Rio chuckled. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I take it you popped the question?” He grinned as Scratchy joined him on the couch.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, yeah I did.” Rio beamed as she pulled Agatha in tight.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha grinned “I said yes!” </span></p>

<p><span>The next week flew by in a whirl of highs and lows. While the demands and expectations of preparing for the festival increased day by day, and the aches and pains of late pregnancy only seemed to worsen, in the spare moments Agatha hovered in a surreal cloud of joy and bliss in the aftermath of her engagement to Rio. They celebrated with an utterly shocked and surprised Nat, Hela, and Yelena at brunch the next day. Hosted a congratulatory and welcome back dinner with Jen, Alice, and Ralph that Wednesday. And though she had tried to keep it under wraps as much as she could at work with everything else going on, by Thursday someone had let the news slip to Sharon who was practically beside herself with excitement. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re engaged?!” She shouted as she burst into her office that morning, breakfast in hand. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha groaned and rolled her eyes. “Who told you that?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Your dear friend with the blonde hair. I think his name is Randy? I was down at the cafe picking up your smoothie and we were talking about the party on Saturday and he asked if I was there for the engagement. And I said what engagement and he told me sweet Rio proposed!” Sharon squealed in delight. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ugh! I knew I shouldn’t have asked him to come and help!” Agatha grumbled as she continued sorting through emails. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So? Where’s the ring?” Sharon asked, too delighted by the news to be intimidated by Agatha’s sullen demeanor </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Shouldn’t you be meeting with the management team to go over the staff list instead of here prying into my personal life?” Agatha droned as she reviewed her nearly endless list of tasks for the day. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, right, of course! I didn’t mean to overstep. I’m just so excited for you both! Rio is such a delight and I see how happy you two are and with the baby on the way you’re just going to make the sweetest little family!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Focus, Heart! Management team, staff list! I’ll need that before lunch today!” Agatha scolded</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes! Yes, I’m on it!” Sharon muttered as she headed to the door. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sharon!” Agatha called after her just before she disappeared. “Not a word of this to anyone! I need these people focused on the task at hand, not flittering about gossiping about this nonsense.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh absolutely!” Sharon twittered. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And if you see Ralph tell him I need to see him asap!” Agatha barked </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Will do, dear!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And…thank you.” Agatha muttered</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“For what?” Sharon turned, a bit confused. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“For the gifts. The quilt, and blanket, and stuff. That was…kind of you.” She said without lifting her gaze from her work. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh of course dear! It was a wonderful excuse to craft again. I haven’t made anything like that since my grandson was born and it…”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don’t need the details!” Agatha snipped, cutting her off. “Just go get the staff list.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes! Right away.” Sharon said as she shuffled out and with a click of the door behind her Agatha was alone in her office. </span></p><p><span>She leaned back in her chair with a sigh as her hand glided around the swollen orb of her belly. Over the last few days, as she trapsed nearly every corner inside and out of Music hall, and in doing so the weight of her son had sunk low pressing into her hips and as he shifted within her it sparked an urgent pain in her lower back. She closed her eyes and breathed through the worst of it with a hum. </span></p><p><span>“Alright little bug, enough of that now!” She warned as the pain subsided. “I know this week hasn’t been easy but there’s no need to rush these things! There’s still too much to do!” She groaned as she looked back over her list. She added a few more items before her gaze caught the time. </span><em><span>Shit! </span></em><span>She was going to be late for her meeting with Herb on the opening ceremony. She gathered her things as quickly as she could and heaved herself from the chair. The first few steps were strained as her hips and feet protested the movement but she eased into a tolerable pace just as she reached the door which miraculously swung open before her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey mama!” Ralph gleamed practically bouncing on the balls of his feet. His light and buoyant energy striking a jealous nerve within her. “Sharon said you wanted to see me?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes.” She groaned, shoving past him. “Walk with me.” She commanded as she waddled down the hallway toward the elevator. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Girl! You look like you’re having a rough time today!” Ralph snickered</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, what gave it away?” She glowered </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re breathing heavily and walking like a penguin. Can I carry something for you?” He offered</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“If you insist, I’m not going to argue.” She grunted as she turned and handed him her things. “Did you tell Sharon about the engagement?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She was at the party! I thought she already knew!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well she didn’t, and no one else here needs to know especially right now. I didn’t bring you here to gossip about me to my coworkers, I need you and them focused on getting everything in its place before tomorrow.” She scolded as she pressed the button for the elevator. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Which is exactly what I was doing before you called me up here!” He scoffed. “Don’t worry, I’ll keep my mouth shut. Even though it’s not as big of a deal as you’re making it out to be. So what if they know you and Rio are getting married?!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Shhh! Keep your voice down!” She spat. “I am nothing more than an employee and acquaintance to these people and I like to keep it that way. I don’t need them to know any more about my personal life than they already do.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What, you don’t want people to be happy for you?” He huffed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Honestly no, I’d prefer them to be wary and a little intimidated, makes it easier to get things done and there’s too much left to do. This pregnancy has already broken more of that illusion than I would like.” She scoffed as she glided a hand against the surface. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don’t know about that! I think at this point everyone’s just scared if they set you off you might go into spontaneous labor.” He chuckled earning a vicious glare from Agatha</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Not funny!” She growled as she stepped into the elevator. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh come on! It was just a joke! Though I have to say it doesn’t seem too far-fetched, you are looking pretty </span><em><span>rotund </span></em><span>these days.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ralph!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Could you imagine! You’ve done all this work and the kid decides now’s the perfect time to pop out?” He cackled. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“RALPH!”</span><span><br/><br/></span></p><p><span>“Sounds like something I would do! HAHA! Hate to miss a good party you know!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ralph! I swear if you don’t shut the </span><em><span>fuck</span></em><span> up right now…” She started just as the elevator opened to Herb standing before her on the ground floor. “Heyyyy Herb! I was just coming to meet you!” She lilted, plastering a grin across her face. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha! Good morning! I was just about to check and see if we needed to move this to your office. I know you’ve been on your feet a lot this week so I don’t want to force you into anything unnecessarily.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No need! I’m here now, just moving a little slowly today.” She grimaced</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Understandibly so!” He grinned as he eyed Ralph beside her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I, uh, I’m just gonna go back to setting up the vendor booths, I’ll catch you at lunch.” Ralph said as he handed her things back and scurried off. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Friend of yours?” Herb asked with a frown</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Unfortunately so. Shall we?” She huffed as she headed into the lobby with Herb in tow.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>—------------------------------------</span></p><p> </p><p><span>The rest of the morning did nothing to ease her aches and pains. After running through the set up, timing, and Herb’s speech a few dozen times for the initial kickoff she had to rush to help manage a sound system issue with the rear stage. Just as she had quelled that fire she was called to the front of the building where she had to walk the lighting and special effects crew through their set up plans for the umpteenth time. By the time lunch rolled around she was barely able to make it back to her office before collapsing onto the couch in the corner. She quickly kicked her shoes off of her aching feet and slumped onto her side. Just as she got relatively comfortable there was a knock at her door. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ugh! Whoever it is, go away and come back in 10!” She wined </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Even me?” Rio’s voice lilted from the other side of the door as it began to creek open. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You, my love, are the only exception!” She sighed as a hint of a smile flashed across her lips. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh Cariño! You look positively exhausted!” Rio cried as she hobbled over with her cane to sit near Agatha’s feet. “You’ve been doing too much again haven’t you!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s been a bit of a hectic morning running from one end of the building to the other, but nothing I can’t handle.” Agatha chuckled though her eyes betrayed the true strain of the day. “I’ll have enough of a break now that I’ll be able to finish out the day.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I thought when you hired Ralph to help he’d be doing more of the running around for you! Wasn’t that the whole point?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh he is, and it's taken a lot off my plate but things keep popping up and it’s easier if I just handle it myself.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Easier for who, exactly?” Rio asked, eyebrows hitched in skepticism. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Me mostly, that way I know things are being done correctly!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Mhmmm.” Rio rolled her eyes and hummed doubtfully. “Tell me you’re not staying late again at least!” Rio urged as she gathered one of Agatha’s feet and began to rub. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, no! I should be home by six. There’s just a few more things we have to set for today and then I’m done.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And you have to be here for all of it?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ugh! I shudder to think what would happen if I wasn’t! Do you know, they tried to set up the flame launchers along the main stairway out front!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh how could they!” Rio gasped as if she had any idea what Agatha was talking about. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Luckily I intervened in time to move them to the proper location along the pedestals, away from passing patrons! The last thing we need is to set someone on fire with some stupid pyrotechnics trick.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Good thing you were there to save the day!” Rio chuckled </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And our asses!” Agatha snorted “Ahhh, I’m so glad you’re here, and you’re rubbing my feet, and you brought food, maybe?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You know I did! A sandwich from your favorite place!” Rio beamed as she pulled the food out of her bag</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ugh! I knew I said yes for a reason! You are the absolute best!” Agatha sighed as she struggled to sit, wincing in pain at every movement. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You sure you’re going to make it the rest of the day?” Rio chuckled skeptically </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“As long as this kid stops kicking me in the kidneys I’ll be fine.” She groaned as she pressed a hand to her back, trying to ease another growing ache.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sweetheart, you look so uncomfortable!” Rio sighed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What gave you that idea?” Agatha scoffed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You really should go home and rest. Especially if you’re going to try and make it through opening night tomorrow.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’ll be fine!” Agatha grumbled as the pain crested and began to release. “As long as nothing else goes awry, this afternoon will mostly be registration prep and printing out credentials for the people working tomorrow. Nothing strenuous.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“If you say so…” Rio frowned. “I do worry about you.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m well aware, dear.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You missed your medication again this morning!” She scolded as she pulled the pill bottle out of her bag. “You really need to stay on top of this!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I know! I know, it just slipped my mind as I was rushing out the door. Thank you for bringing it.” She said with a half smile as she pressed a kiss to Rio’s cheek before heaving herself up from the couch. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How’s your blood pressure been?” Rio questioned. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fine! Perfectly fine.” Agatha replied dismissively as she dug into the sandwich. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“When was the last time you checked?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“This morning, I think.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You think?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Or maybe it was last night. I can’t quite remember.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sorry, the days just all blend together at this point.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Which is exactly why you need to slow down and rest before you end up in the hospital before this baby’s even born! Please! I couldn’t bear it if anything happened to you! Either of you!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha stood frozen and silent in the wake of Rio’s pleading, her gaze avoidant and fixed on the mess of paperwork on her desk. She felt a pang of guilt for the worry and stress she was causing her but what could she do? The success of this event that she had already poured so much of herself into was riding squarely on her shoulders, not to mention her reputation and obligation to the donors. Failure in this moment was unconscionable. </span></p><p><span>As she struggled to find words of reassurance she felt Rio’s warm and comforting presence ease into the space behind her. Her cautious, delicate fingers entwining themselves in the tresses of her long hair, pulling a heavy sigh from Agatha’s lips as she leaned into the touch. Carefully Rio inched closer, her hands wrapping around the underside of Agatha’s swollen belly, lifting and easing some of the weight she was carrying, eliciting a soft moan of relief as she rested her chin on her shoulder. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s ok to rest. To take a step back.” She whispered, her lips grazing along the shell of Agatha’s ear. “Come home with me.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Her mind ached in protest, as her body softened at the relief of Rio’s hands fully supporting the weight of their child. It felt like she could finally breathe as the pressure, the strain that had been plaguing her was lifted if only for a moment. She could almost feel tears of relief begin to well in her eyes as her will slowly started to crack. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio, I…” she began, but just as the words left her mouth the door to her office swung open. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sorry it took longer than I thought but here is the finalized version of the staff list and then Jerry from the management team wanted…OH! Oh I’m so sorry I didn’t realize you were…that you two were…oh dear I should have knocked.” Sharon blabbered in a flustered panic. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey Sharon!” Rio smirked as she slowly removed her support from Agatha’s bump and took a step back. “No worries, we weren’t doing anything too indecent.” She chuckled with a wink. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh I… um…well, aha-ha, how…uh…how’s your leg doing, dear?” Sharon stumbled trying to recover her composure. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Doing much better! Still taking it easy. Wish I could say the same for this one.” She pointed a thumb in Agatha’s direction who was standing at the edge of her desk, one arm bracing her weight as the other curled under her bump trying to ease the pressure and aching that had returned all too quickly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What…um…what were you saying about Jerry?” Agatha managed to croak out through her unsteady breaths. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“He wanted me to let you know they’re having an issue wiring some of the vendor booths and he needs to go over some options with you.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ok, tell him I’ll be down in a bit. You can put the staff list on my desk for now.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Sharon dropped the papers on her desk and started to bolt for the door. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Wait! Can’t Herb handle it?” Rio called out to Sharon. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Sharon’s eyes darted to Agatha nervously as she replied. “Unfortunately he’s rehearsing with the orchestra at the moment.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Then what about Ralph?” She asked turning to Agatha. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“He’s a temporary worker; he can't sign off on any changes.” Agatha explained. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well then you do it.” Rio half yelled towards Sharon. “I don’t see why it always has to be her!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Because I’m in charge, my love.” Agatha sighed as she slid on her shoes and walked past Rio, giving her a peck on her cheek along the way. “It should only take a few minutes, wait here, I’ll be right back!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio let out a huff in disappointment as soon as Agatha was out the door. “Sorry for getting loud with you Sharon. I didn’t mean anything by it.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh honey it’s alright. I wish I could have been of more help. Is there anything I can get you while you’re waiting?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, I’m alright. Thank you though. I’ll…uh…I’ll just make myself at home until she gets back.”  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright. If you need anything I’ll be over at my desk.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Thanks Sharon.” Rio mumbled as she shuffled over to plop on the couch and wait. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>20 minutes passed, then another, then just as she reached almost an hour she heard the door handle click.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Finally! I thought I was going to have to come look…Ralph?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey Mami!” He gleamed as he snuck into the room. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re not Agatha!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Thankfully no! I would not want to be her right now!” Ralph laughed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Where is she?” Rio glowered </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She’s still dealing with the electrical stuff, it’s a bit of a shit show down there. She sent me up here to let you know, she didn’t want you waiting forever.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How thoughtful.” Rio grumbled dryly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She wanted me to tell you she’s sorry, if she could leave right now she absolutely would but, and I quote, </span><em><span>These fucking idiots wouldn’t know their ass from a hole in the ground let alone how to properly set up these fucking booths.</span></em><span>”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ah! That bad huh?” Rio huffed “Well… I guess I’ll head out then. Can you keep an eye on her? She really shouldn’t be up and about this place like she is, it’s practically killing her.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh don’t worry, once she started storming about downstairs I grabbed her a chair and made her take a seat.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Thanks, and make sure she eats the rest of this, she can’t be running on fumes either.” Rio said as she handed Ralph Agatha’s lunch. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That was the other thing she sent me for that and…”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Her pills?” Rio finished, shaking the bottle as she handed it to him. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Exactly! Thanks. Are you good?” Ralph asked, seeing her dismay. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I will be once this fucking weekend is over! I’m hoping that once things get started she’ll actually chill out a bit.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’ve met her right?” Ralph chuckled, “I don’t think that woman has chilled out a day in her life!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I know, it’s like pulling teeth to get her to relax, but I’m worried what all this is doing to her and the baby. All this stress, it can’t end well.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I get it, I even told her this morning she’s looking a little worse for the wear, and I think she is starting to feel it. Oh that was the other thing, she did say even though she can’t leave just yet she will try and sneak out early.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Heh! I’ll believe it when I see it!” Rio scoffed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I told her I’d hold her to it. If anything pops up I’ll try and keep her out of the loop and make sure she’s out of here at a reasonable time.” Ralph assured</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Thanks man! It's really good to have you back!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And I am so glad to be back! The drama on this last ship was getting to be too much even for me! It’s been nice taking a step back.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ha! Can you tell that to Agatha?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’ll try. And thanks for letting me crash at your place! First time I’ve had that much space to myself in a long time.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Of course! I’m just glad it’s getting some use while I still have the lease! Alright, well I’ll catch you later!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>—————————————————-</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Early in the evening, as Rio was working through her physical therapy exercises on the floor with cartoons blaring as background noise, she heard the soft click of the door handle before Agatha stumbled across the threshold and she jumped up to greet her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“My love! You’re home!” she cried excitedly as she took Agatha’s bag from her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I told you I’d try to get out early!” She replied with a slight, tired smile. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s just after 5:00.” Rio chuckled, unimpressed.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Exactly! I made it home before six.” Agatha sighed as she sunk into the couch. “Help, please!” She pouted as she stuck her feet out for Rio to help her with her shoes. Rio perched herself on the edge of the coffee table, willingly obliging the request. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How’d the rest of the day go? You all set for tomorrow?” Rio asked as she slid off the shoes</span><span><br/><br/></span></p><p><span>“As set as we can be.” Agatha sighed in relief as Rio began to rub the sore appendages. “It took me another hour with that guy after you left to find a reasonable solution to our power problem but thankfully that’s sorted. Sharon was able to get all the badges made for me while I oversaw the set up of the entryway. Now all that’s left is to hope people actually show up tomorrow.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m sure it’ll be a hit. I’ve seen it all over social media and even heard them talking about it on the news this week when I was at the hospital. People seem excited.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ugh! I hope so! I can’t afford for this to be a flop after all the work and money we’ve put into it.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And all that effort shows! The place looked incredible when I left! I can’t wait to see it all come together tomorrow night!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m so glad you’re going to be there! I don’t think I’d be able to survive the night without you.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Of course! I wouldn’t miss it for the world!” Rio smiled back though her joy quickly turned to concern as she watched Agatha hiss sharply as her brow furrowed in discomfort. “You ok? What’s going on?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Nothing…it’s fine. Just sore, my back’s been aching off and on all day.” She said with a wince</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Contractions?” Rio questioned, a bit concerned.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, no, I’m sure it’s just inflammation, a pinched nerve or something from being on my feet too long.” Agatha brushed off with a wave. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Why don’t I draw you a bath and while you’re soaking I can make us some dinner?” Rio offered</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ugh! That sounds amazing! Why are you so good to me?” Agatha sighed as she reached out a hand, brushing her fingers lovingly along the curve of Rio’s cheek. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Because you deserve it! You’ve been working too hard and you need to relax.” Rio leaned forward and pressed a kiss to Agatha’s lips, and then to the bump before she stood and shuffled towards the hallway. “Don’t move! I’ll be back in a bit when it’s ready.” she called before disappearing down the hallway. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>As she waited, Agatha settled further into the couch, allowing her eyes to flutter closed as she eased into the stillness. Her body was heavy and sore with all she had been putting it through, her feet swollen and pulsing with the rhythm of her heartbeat. Her hips throbbed with the weight and pressure of her son bearing down into the joints. Every movement either of them made now resulted in pain and discomfort. She was tired, tired of the heartburn, tired of being swollen, tired of peeing every hour, tired of being pregnant. </span></p><p><span>Yet in her heart the fears still loomed. Though her body was at its limits she wasn’t mentally prepared for what was coming; the labor, the birth, motherhood. It all still seemed too daunting, even with Rio’s attentiveness and support. It was a reality she knew she had to come to terms with but the more she thought about it the further she tried to push it away. </span><em><span>She still had time</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>still had weeks left to go</span></em><span>. She could get through these last few hurdles at work and then focus on reconciling the imminent future. Yet even as these thoughts crossed her mind a part of her hummed with anxiety at the shadow of pain that had been visiting her throughout the day and still clung to her now after appearing again moments before. </span><em><span>It was nothing…right? </span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>As she washed these concerns from her mind once again she heard Rio’s voice ring out as her footsteps drew close once more. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright, my love! I have everything set, you ready?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“My heart says yes but I don’t know how I’m going to move at this point!” She cried </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t worry, I got you!” Rio smirked as she hobbled towards Agatha and reached out a hand. She helped her to sit at the edge of the couch then with some effort pulled her to her feet. “You ok?” She asked, seeing the pain in her face as she stood grasping Rio at the shoulders. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha bit her lip as she breathed through her nose, the pain and pressure in just moving to stand was nearly unbearable. “I’m fine…” she grunted as she forced her feet to move. “I shouldn’t have sat down, my whole body is stiff now.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s ok! Take your time. I’ve got you!” Rio encouraged as she guided Agatha away from the couch. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh yeah?” Agatha huffed as she cracked a smile. “You and that bum knee of yours?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“My knee’s fine! I’ve got the brace on and the therapist says I’m good to walk around the house at least.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“If you say so.” Agatha sighed as she waddled down the hallway, holding onto Rio as she winced with each step. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>As they made it to the bedroom Agatha began peeling off her clothes. She quickly slid off her shirt and braced herself against the wall as she struggled to rid herself of her pants. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Here sweetheart, let me help you.” Rio cooed as she guided Agatha to the bed to help her tug them the rest of the way down. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck! I’m so tired of struggling to do every little thing. I can’t even get undressed by myself!” Agatha groaned as she flopped back, allowing Rio to help undress her the rest of the way. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I know, Cariño, but it’s to be expected at this point.” She reassured as she pulled Agatha to her feet. “You’ve been so strong, only a few more weeks, my love.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ugh! I don’t know how I’m going to make it a few more weeks. I am so not ready to give birth but I am beyond over being pregnant at this point.” Agatha groaned as Rio eased her towards the bathroom. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hopefully this will take your mind off of it, and ease some of those aches and pains, if just for a bit.” Rio smiled softly as she opened the door. </span></p><p><span>The room glowed in a warm halo of vanilla and amber, as candles flickered across every surface of the bathroom. Steam curled from the tub along the window as rose petals floated delicately on the surface and soft soothing music lilted from a small speaker across the room. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You really don’t do anything half way do you?” Agatha chuckled as she stepped into the oasis. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Not when it comes to you, my love.” Rio cooed as she pressed a kiss to Agatha’s cheek. She led her over to the tub and held her steady as she helped her into the warm water. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>As soon as her foot broke the surface Agatha let out a sigh of relief. Slowly, with Rio’s careful assistance, she eased herself into the water, letting out a soft moan as soon as she was submerged. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Too hot? Too cold?” Rio asked as she laid back. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s perfect, sweetheart, thank you!” She sighed, puckering her lips to invite Rio in for a kiss. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright, I’m gonna go get dinner ready. I have the baby monitor set over there on the counter so holler if you need anything.” Rio said as she swiped a piece of hair from Agatha’s face and placed a kiss on her forehead before heading out. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>As she soothed her sore muscles and joints in the warm water Agatha closed her eyes and sank down, submerging herself just above her shoulders. As the pain started to ease she could feel her son begin to shift and move within her. She cracked her eyes open and watched as the crest of her stomach bobbed about in the water. She drew a hand to the surface and danced her fingertips across her belly, circling his movements. </span></p><p><span>“Long day huh bug?” She hummed as he continued to stretch. “You’ve been just as busy as I have! Mama felt you movin about all day. I’m sure you’re tired, I certainly am.” She said with a yawn. “You’re getting heavy in there, not sure how much more room I can give you. You just gotta hold tight. Only a few more weeks and then you can join us out here. Mami’s got your room all ready. We’re all very excited to meet you, just don’t listen to uncle Ralph! No surprise appearances ok?” She felt a long rolling shift as her belly button bounced up and down. “I’m gonna take that as a yes.” She chuckled to herself. She closed her eyes as she set her hand to rest on her stomach, letting his little motions soothe her further. It was the most relaxed and calm she had felt in weeks and she nearly drifted to sleep, but as the heat of the water got to her she reluctantly decided to get out. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She slowly sat up out of the water and just as she managed to shift to her knees she felt another tight curling pain begin in her back. It was the same pressure she had experienced throughout that day but it grew stronger and wrapped around the whole of her belly. She gripped tightly at the edge of the tub as the pain intensified and let out a sharp gasp just as it reached its peak. She held on, breathing as calmly as she could until the wave passed and she felt like she could move again. Just as she began to shift, Rio burst through the door. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha? Is everything ok? I thought I heard you on the monitor.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha breathed calmly as she smiled up at Rio. “It’s fine! I’m fine. Just having a little difficulty getting out. My back was bothering me again.” She said, not wanting to raise any alarm bells. Surely she had just overdone it for the day and her body was reacting in protest</span><em><span>. It was nothing.</span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>“I told you to call for me if you needed anything!” Rio scolded. “Here, let me help you out.” She let Rio hoist her out of the tub and wrap her in a soft warm towel. “I’ve set out some clothes for you on the bed, do you want some help getting dressed?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, no I should be fine. The bath helped a lot, I think I can manage now.” Agatha assured, hoping to dissuade any concerns. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright, I’m gonna go finish up dinner. If you do need help just let me know.” Rio replied on her way back out. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>As soon as she was out of sight Agatha turned off the monitor and stared at herself in the mirror. </span><em><span>She was fine! Everything was fine! </span></em><span>Her gaze darted down to her bump as she smoothed a hand over the surface, staring at her profile in the mirror. </span><em><span>It was just a fluke, surely! Just a spasm, nothing to worry about. </span></em><span>She laughed it off as she ghosted a hand over the surface. </span></p><p><span>“Not funny, little bug!” She muttered in a hushed whisper.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>She hurriedly dried herself off and quick as she could, changed into the large t-shirt and shorts Rio had set out. Once dressed she headed for the door but stopped short, catching her reflection again in the full length mirror. </span><em><span>Ralph was right, she was quite round.</span></em><span> She analyzed her reflection for a moment longer before brushing the whole thing off and heading for the kitchen. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ah! Perfect! Just in time! I made some chicken enchiladas with rice and beans. Go have a seat, I'll bring you a plate.” Too tired to argue Agatha waddled over to the recliner and settled in. Rio buzzed about in the kitchen for a few minutes more then brought her a plate before settling into the couch beside her. “So what’s the plan for tomorrow?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Huh? Oh, tomorrow, right, the festival.” Agatha laughed, the question having pulled her back to the present moment. “Well, good news is I don’t have to be in until 11.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh that’s fantastic! Hopefully you’ll be able to sleep in.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hopefully, we’ll see if he lets me.” She said with a nervous laugh. “Bad news is I don’t think I’ll have time to come home and get ready or pick you up.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh no! I was hoping we could all ride together!” Rio pouted </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I know, hon! Are Jen and Alice still planning to carpool?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“As far as I know. But if you want me to come early and help you get ready I’m sure they’ll understand.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh no! Don’t worry about it, Ralph will be there to help me. You ride with them.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright, sounds like a plan. Are you nervous?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“About what?” Agatha replied, with a waiver to her voice as her mind still prickled over the earlier incident. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“About the festival?” Rio laughed, “What else?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh right! Yes, yeah…a bit…a bit nervous.” Agatha stuttered </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are you sure you’re ok? You’re being weird.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What? Yes! Perfectly fine! Just tired, yes, very tired.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Heh, if you say so, weirdo.” Rio scoffed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Their evening quickly settled into casual conversation, a few episodes of a show they’d both seen a dozen times but found comfort in repeating, and Rio snuggling up to Agatha’s bump on the couch, her head resting on the side as her hand spread across the surface, feeling every shift and turn. Before long they were both struggling to keep their eyes open and Rio finally admitted it was time to head to bed. She helped peel Agatha from the couch and they headed down the hallway. They each slowly and sleepily moved about in their nightly rhythm, dancing around each other as they readied for sleep. Unencumbered by the struggles of pregnancy Rio quickly settled into bed with a novel while Agatha continued to shift about the bathroom. </span></p><p><span>She was stood at the sink, half asleep brushing her teeth when she felt another ache creep into the small of her back. It started softly but quickly bloomed, crawling up her spine as it began to wrap around her core, an incessant squeezing pressure that grew and grew as it bore down through to her hips. She dropped her toothbrush into the sink with a clatter as her body curled around the pain, her hips swaying back and forth searching for any release in the tension as she tried to silently breathe her way through the worst of it. Then, just as she thought her legs might give out under the weight of it all, the wave began to recede, drawing its claws back once more. </span></p><p><span>She hovered at the sink, pulse racing as she righted herself, one hand cradling the underside of her belly. She spit what was left of the toothpaste in her mouth into the sink and patted herself dry with a towel before she chanced a glance at her reflection. She could see the ghost of fear and a spark of uncertainty in her eyes as she tried to reason the experience. </span><em><span>She was tired. She had pushed herself way too hard and was on her feet way too long. She just needed to lie down and rest, give herself a break and relax. Yes, just too much stress! </span></em></p><p><span>She took a deep calming breath before she flipped off the lights and headed to join Rio in bed. She peeled back the sheets and slipped in beside her before turning off her bedside lamp and settling onto her side with Rio at her back. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Not going to read your book tonight?” Rio cooed as she turned a page. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, too tired. Big day tomorrow.” Agatha mumbled as she shut her eyes tightly, hoping to erase the event from her mind. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well then, I won’t keep you up.” Rio sighed as she placed her book on the nightstand and turned off her own light. Agatha felt her shuffle further under the covers before her warm body pressed against her back. Rio slung her arm around Agatha’s waist, intertwining their fingers together to rest along the surface of her stomach as her face nuzzled into the crook of her neck amongst her hair, her soft breath pulsating down along her collarbone. Here, cradled in Rio’s arms, her fears began to subside. “Goodnight, cariño.” Rio hummed as she pressed a kiss to Agatha’s shoulder, the gesture easing the last of her worries.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Goodnight, my love.” She whispered back as she let out a sigh and drifted off to sleep. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>————————————————</span></p><p> </p><p><span>By now she was used to nightly disturbances, being awoken with an urgency to pee throughout the night was routine at this point, yet earlier than she expected she was awoken first by another sensation. The aching pressure had returned once again and pulled her from a deep slumber in its presence. Her skin prickled as her heart began to race. She squeezed her eyes shut as she lay still waiting for it to pass, taking shallow breaths through her nose until the pain began to ebb. </span></p><p><span>Finally released from its clutches she dared to crack an eye open. She turned slightly, checking that Rio was sound asleep, before she reached over to her nightstand and checked the time. Just after midnight. She had been asleep for an hour and a half, maybe two at most. She set the phone back down on the nightstand and slowly pried herself from under Rio’s limbs, figuring now was as good a time as any to relieve herself. She made quick work of the task and shuffled back into bed, snuggling in so her head now rested on Rio’s chest. She listened closely to the sound of her heart beat, slow and steady as she slept, the rise and fall of her chest soothing her quickly back to slumber. </span></p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p><span>She had just started to dream when the pain returned, slow and steady, breaking through the visions that her mind was conjuring. She could hear a whimpering moan escape her lips as she was pulled back to consciousness. Her body began to rock as she tried to soothe the ache but the motion was not enough. In an exhausted stupor she rolled herself to the edge of the bed where her fingers clutched at the mattress and sheets just as the wave reached its peak and she let out a soft gasp just as it all began to fall away. She lingered there for a moment, still dazed in a half sleep as her body released the last remnants of tension before she reached out again to check the time. Just after 1:30. As she set the phone back down she felt a hand press against her back. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Everything ok?” Rio’s voice croaked behind her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, just a bad dream. Go back to sleep.” She murmured. She heard Rio mumble something in agreement as her hand slipped from her back. </span><em><span>It was just a bad dream. </span></em><span>She repeated to herself as her eyes slammed shut and she rolled back into bed. </span></p><p><br/><br/><br/></p><p><span>At just past 2:30 the need to pee drew her once again from slumber. She let out a deep tired sigh as she heaved herself from under the covers and into the bathroom. As she sat in the darkness, her eyes still closed, arm propped against the wall holding her head aloft in her hand, the ache snuck upon her once more. She braced herself as she drew breaths in through her nose and out through her mouth, her face contorted in discomfort as yet another wave crashed through her. Her heartbeat pulsed throughout her body, quick and angry as her body curved around the pain, the intensity bringing her fully out of her tired stupor. She held fast, not making a sound until every drop of discomfort had dissipated. Now fully alert she could feel a cool panic begin to creep into the edges of her mind. She rose from her seat and, quiet as she could, made her way through the bedroom and out down the hallway to the kitchen. </span></p><p><span>She bustled about for a bit, fixing herself a cup of tea as her mind warred over the night so far. </span><em><span>False labor. </span></em><span>It had to be, it was too early for it to be anything else. Her body training itself for the real thing. </span><em><span>Jen had said they would get more frequent didn’t she? More intense as well?</span></em><span> That was the only thing that could explain it. That and the fact that she had indeed seemed to have overextended herself and her body was making her pay. </span></p><p><span>As she held the warm cup up to her lips she breathed in the herbal tincture letting the earthy, floral brew relax her fears. She sipped carefully as her hand pressed against the underside of her belly, feeling the soft movements of her son stirring. He was there, he was safe, and that’s where he would stay. She quickly finished the honied liquid and set the mug back on the counter before returning to bed once again. </span></p><p><br/><br/><br/></p><p><span>The rest of the night continued in suit, nearly every hour she would be yanked from sleep as her body succumbed to pressure and pain. Each time she fought the wary thoughts that arose as she clung as best she could to slumber. Yet as daylight began to break the pattern ceased, the waves subsided and she at last had some reprieve from the agony. With her body at ease she finally enjoyed a few hours of peaceful slumber. </span></p><p><br/><br/><br/></p><p><span>At 9:30 her alarm rang and with a groan she shut it off and rolled back over in bed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Good morning, Cariño!” Rio yawned as she stretched herself awake. “Today’s the day! Aren’t you excited?” She asked cheerfully as she tucked her arms around Agatha, pulling her in close to her side. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Eh! Hardly!” Agatha groaned, burying her face in Rio’s chest. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh no! Did you have a rough night?” Rio cooed as she stroked her hair comfortingly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I was up and down half the night. I finally got some good sleep around seven until my alarm went off just now.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh sweetheart! I’m so sorry! Do I need to have a talk with our son about his late night partying?” Rio chuckled </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, he behaved himself for the most part. I just couldn’t get comfortable.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Did you say you had a bad dream at some point or did I make that up?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh…yeah. Bit of a nightmare actually.” Agatha groaned. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How awful! What happened?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I…uh…don’t quite remember the details now.” Agatha frowned, recalling the pains that had plagued her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well, you take your time getting up and about, I’m gonna go get breakfast started. You want me to take you in today?” Rio asked as she crawled out from under the sheets. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No that’s alright. If you’re carpooling later we’ll be able to leave when we need to if I have my car.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Good thinking!” Rio applauded as she leaned in to kiss Agatha’s forehead. “Any special requests from either of you for breakfast?”  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Do we have any of that cinnamon toast left?” She smiled coyly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I believe so.” Rio smirked </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Can you do that thing with the peanut butter and sugar and melt it like a crème brûlée?” She grinned deliciously. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“As you wish, beloved!” She said with a bow and started to head out. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh and some scrambled eggs!” Agatha called after her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You got it!” Rio shouted back. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha pressed her hands to her face as she yawned herself awake. As she lay there her mind filtered through memories of that night, restless and painful and a bit terrifying. She checked her phone again. 9:45. She had about 45 minutes to get ready, gather her things for that day and later that evening, eat breakfast and head out the door to begin what was due to be another demanding and nerve wracking day. </span></p><p><span>She threw the covers off her body, exposing the bare bulge of her stomach poking out from below the hem of her shirt which had ridden up in the night. She yawned and stretched out her whole self, earning a nudge of greeting from her son. </span></p><p><span>“Good morning little bug!” She yawned, “What a night huh? Let’s make sure that’s the last of that for a while, ok? Today’s a big day and we want everything to go smoothly.” She insisted before pushing herself to sit at the edge of the bed. Immediately she felt a shift, her breath felt easier, lighter, yet there was an urgent pressure low in her hips making it more uncomfortable than usual to sit. She slid off the bed to stand and felt the pressure worsen so she moved as quickly as she could with a heavy waddle to the bathroom to relieve herself. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>As she went about her morning routine she kept sneaking quick glances at her profile in the mirror. There was a distinct change in positioning, a heavy sagging that was more present than ever before. </span><em><span>Just a coincidence, </span></em><span>she told herself. She hadn’t had any of the pains in hours. Surely this was just part of the joys of late pregnancy. She brushed it off and continued getting dressed and gathering her things before she headed out to Rio’s breakfast in the kitchen. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Looking good, mama!” Rio cheered as she rounded the corner. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Thank you, baby!” Agatha sighed tiredly as she gave Rio a peck on the cheek before she settled onto the stool with a wince. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I have your peanut butter toast, and eggs, and most importantly, your meds!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Can’t forget those!” Agatha scoffed as she quickly swallowed the pill. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So I guess Jen’s off at four today then they’ll come over and get ready. The kick off is at 6:00 right?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Exactly. Herb will give his little speech, there’ll be this performance thing in the center of the entryway and then it officially starts.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ah! I’m so excited! It’s going to be amazing! I can’t wait!” Rio cheered as she settled onto the stool next to Agatha. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“If turnout ends up being what we expected that place is going to be a madhouse!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh I’m sure it will be! Where should we plan to meet you?” Rio asked. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’ll be with Herb when he gives his speech on the balcony and there should be space up there for you all but if Jen doesn’t get off until four you’ll be cutting it pretty close and it may already be full.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Eh, you’re probably right. Ground floor then, might be a better view anyway.” Rio smirked with a wink. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ralph will be stationed by the bar down there which may be easier to get to if we want to meet up there afterwards.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Where is that?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’ll be over on the left side, should give you a good view of everything.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Then we’ll plan to find Ralph.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh don’t worry, you won’t be able to miss him. He’ll be about six and a half feet tall with his headdress on, bright red and orange and he mentioned something about it all glowing.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Perfect! Then we’ll keep an eye out for the giant flaming queen.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright, my love! This was delicious but I have to head out. I’ll see you later at the festival.” She gave Rio another peck on the cheek then slid off the stool to gather her things. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Do you want some help out to the car?” Rio offered</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, no. I’ve got it.” Agatha insisted with a grunt. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ok then. Have a good day, try and take it easy. I love you!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Love you too, hon!” Agatha smiled softly as she shuffled out the door. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>—————————————————-</span></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><span>She had barely made it to the stop sign at the end of the street when she felt the stirring of another ache begin to wrap around her center. “</span><em><span>FUCK!” </span></em><span>she gasped as her hand gripped the steering wheel. She breathed deeply through her nose as her eyes clenched shut waiting for the pain to pass. Though it wasn’t as intense as they had been last night the wave took its time to release her. As she felt the tension start to give she heard a honk from the car waiting behind her. Her gaze quickly flashed to her rearview mirror as she slowly pulled away from the sign. </span></p><p><span>She considered for a moment turning around, heading back home to alert Rio, but then again, it had been hours since the last one. Surely this was just an echo of what she had experienced in the night and maybe she would experience another one or two throughout the day. It wasn’t an emergency and today was too important to falter so she continued on to work. </span></p><p><br/><br/><br/></p><p><span>Nearly 20 minutes later she was ascending the stairs of Music Hall where everything seemed to finally be falling into place. All the booths were aligned in neat little rows with strings of Edison lights bridging above the walkways between them. Flashes of fire and sparks popped along the pedestals as they ran their final inspections with the fire marshals. The set and art pieces had finally been assembled and were being wired for special effects. It was all going according to plan. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She pushed her way into the lobby where she was greeted by an overenthusiastic Herb. who jumped up from behind the registration booth.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha! So glad you finally made it! It’s shaping up to be a wonderful evening, the performers are all set and going through their final rehearsals. We should start seeing some vendors come through any minute, you’re still planning to help get them situated, correct?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I am indeed, I just need to go drop my stuff off and I’ll be back down.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fantastic! Well I won’t hold you then. Hurry back!” He said with a wave.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>She rushed off towards the elevator and quick as she could headed down the administrative hallway towards her office. With everyone busy getting the final touches in place, the administrative side of the building was eerily quiet. She shuffled down the hallway, footsteps echoing on the hardwood as her garment bag with her dress for later swished loudly beside her. As she rounded the corner she was surprised to find that even Sharon was absent from her usual post, likely rushing about for some last minute badges for Herb. With her hands full she wrestled with the door handle and eventually shoved her way into her office where she threw everything she had onto the couch. She fished her phone out of her bag and sent a quick text to Ralph to have him meet her down in the lobby whenever he arrived and then started to turn and leave, but then it hit her, strong and sudden. </span></p><p><span>The gnawing ache had returned with force this time. She could feel the pressure building, low and steady as it threatened to knock her off her feet. She stumbled a few paces over to brace herself against the side of the desk to help ground her until it passed. She swung her hips side to side and tried to stay silent and breathe through the agony but as it crested a gasping moan left her lips and from there she couldn’t help but cry out again as it dissipated. This time the pain didn’t fully escape her, it left behind a strumming coiled tension that hovered at the base of her spine. As she stood there clutching at the desk, still swaying, the door to her office creaked open.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Good morning, dear! Herb had said you were stopping by your office first so I thought I’d try to…catch you…” Sharon stopped suddenly in the doorway as her eyes adjusted to the scene. “OH! Agatha, are you alright?” she cried as she rushed to her side.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m fine!” Agatha snapped as she pushed Sharon back and forced herself to stand. “It’s nothing.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are…are you sure?” Sharon stuttered, gaze skeptical and full of concern. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I said I’m fine! Now what is it?” Agatha groused. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“They want you to take a look at the rear stage before you get set for the day. They need to know if they should move the dragon again.”  Sharon replied timidly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fucking morons! As if we haven’t gone over this a dozen times by now!” She spat </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well they’re worried the tail is going to block some of the seating and they’re having trouble connecting the flame thingy.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fine! Go get set up with Herb, I’ll handle it and be with you all in a bit.” She hissed dismissively with a wave of her hand. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Will do. You sure you’re ok?” Sharon asked as she headed for the door. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Do I have to spell it out for you? Yes! Now go help Herb!” She growled as she practically chased Sharon out of her office, slamming the door behind her. </span></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><span>She stood in the silence, head and hand pressed to the door as her other hand cradled her stomach. Was she ok? No, not in the slightest. Her heart clenched with fear as her mind rushed to squash what she suspected to be true. </span><em><span>It wasn’t time! This wasn’t happening! It couldn’t be! It was too soon! </span></em><span>Yet the now persistent ache in her back suggested otherwise. She took a breath and walked back over to grab her phone. She thought for a moment about texting Rio, but she knew what she would say. Knew that she would be down to the Hall before she could hang up the phone and force her to come home. She couldn’t afford that. Not now, not when everything was so close, mere hours away! And who knows, it could just be a flair up and stop again like it had that morning. All in all she convinced herself it was too soon to tell and wasn’t worth alerting anyone until she was certain, until it was undeniable, and even then there would still be plenty of time, right? Instead she quickly checked the time before tucking her phone into her pocket and headed down to manage the dragon issue. </span></p><p><br/><br/><br/></p><p><span>Though it was a difficult walk down she was able to keep it together long enough to sort through the challenges of making a life sized metal dragon wrap around the stage and breathe fire with only a twinge or two here and there in the couple of hours it took to resolve. With that settled she began to make her way back to the front of the building to meet Herb, and Sharon, and Ralph and help them finish assigning the vendors to their booths. She snuck in through the back entrance and hurried down the hall but just as she was steps away from entering the foyer another wave of pain claimed her. She stopped suddenly at the threshold, pressing a hand against the wall for support as she tried to breathe and remain calm. She could see them only a few yards away chatting about with the line of people gathering their credentials and she didn’t want to draw anyone’s attention. She grit her teeth, straining to push through to the other side of this suffering and just as the pain peaked she caught Ralph’s eye. He cheerily waved, none the wiser, as he beckoned her over. She quickly straightened herself as she flashed him a strained smile and forced herself to move forward through the last of the aching towards the table. Each step sent a shockwave through her system but as she continued the movement helped to ease the last of the tension. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey mama! How’s it going? Big day huh?” Ralph prattled as he met her halfway and gathered her in a hug.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Get off me!” she grumbled as she pried herself from his grasp. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sorry! Old habits! I forget, you have an </span><em><span>aura</span></em><span> to uphold here.” He said as he rolled his eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s not that, I’m just incredibly uncomfortable today and don’t need the added attention.” She scoffed as she straightened herself out.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Heard!” He shrugged. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How’s it been going so far?” She asked as they neared the table</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Going good, I think we’ve checked in about a third of the people expected. Herb said we’ll take a break in a few hours to grab a bite to eat. Need me to get you anything in the meantime?” He offered</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, I’m fine.” She grumbled, still strumming with an echo of pain as they joined the other two. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ah, Agatha! Did we get everything sorted with the dragon?” Herb asked as she settled into the chair next to him with a huff.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes, everything is set and in working order now. Sharon, can you hand me those folders?” She asked, pointing to a basket just as the next person in line stepped up to be helped. Though she didn’t respond, Sharon carefully slid the box to her as she eyed her concernedly. Agatha did her best to ignore the stare and continued on with her work. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Over the next few of hours Agatha did all she could to plaster a facade of calm, cool, and collected across her face, while her body continued to plague her with intermittent throbbing and aching. For the most part the distraction of work and staying seated managed to help with the worst of it though there were a couple of times when she thought she might shatter. Once when she was going over paperwork with a vendor she bit her lip so hard it drew blood just as she snapped the pen she was trying to hand him in two. Then later when she had to move from her chair to gather a set of lanyards she got caught in another wave and gripped onto Ralph’s shoulder to pull her through it, nearly breaking his collar bone in the process as he crumpled under her grip. Nearly the entire time Sharon’s eyes never left her, watching carefully at every sign of distress. When they did finally break to eat she found herself too exhausted to move so she had Ralph go and collect her some food. In the absence of an audience, Sharon hung back and dared once again to voice her concerns.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha, honey, can I talk to you for a moment?” She squeeked, in a voice small and timid.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Does it involve me moving at all?” Agatha groaned as she leaned against the table, one hand rubbing her temple, the other soothing the soft motions of her son.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, no, not at all.” Sharon chirped</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fine. Then out with it Heart.” She groaned, though she refused to look directly at her. Sharon settled in the chair beside her and much to Agatha’s surprise, gathered a hand in hers and looked deeply into her eyes. “What is happening?” Agatha asked as her eyes shifted cautiously.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Honey, is everything alright? Are you feeling ok?” Sharon asked, her gaze intensifying</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha scoffed in disbelief “I am perfectly fine! Just a little sore here at the end of the week is all.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are you sure? You seem to be having a particularly difficult time today, is there anything else going on?” She probed, almost begging Agatha to admit to the pain that had been ravaging her. She considered for a moment, seeing the concern in Sharon’s eyes, spilling all and confessing the fears that were growing with every twinge, but just as she was about to utter the truth she caught sight of Ralph returning with her food. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m fine, Heart. Quit trying to mother me!” She spat as she yanked her hand away at last. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Sharon’s face sank with worry and disappointment as she stood from the table. “If you say so, dear.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I do! Now go get yourself something to eat!” She barked just as Ralph arrived.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What was that about?” He glowered as he watched Sharon walk away.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She’s just being nosy again.” Agatha scoffed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You need to be nicer to her! That woman puts up with way more of your bullshit than any of us and she’s a delight. If you keep yelling at her like that she’s going to quit.” Ralph warned.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She’s not going to quit!” Agatha scoffed.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t be so sure, everyone has their limits. What’s got you in such a bad mood anyway? I figured you’d be ecstatic that it’s opening night.” He asked as he dropped the plate in front of her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m reaching </span><em><span>my </span></em><span>fucking limit with this pregnancy. It’s been unbearable today.” She groaned.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Is that why you almost cracked my shoulder in half earlier?” He chuckled as he began to eat. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“More or less.” She grunted as she felt another ache building. She braced a hand to the side of her stomach and forced herself to continue eating as she tried to push through. She scooped a bite of food onto her spoon and shoved it into her mouth, squeezing her eyes shut as she tried to put all of her focus into chewing instead of the agonizing pain ravaging her body. She managed to choke it down just as the wave subsided but the lingering echo it left was stronger than ever. “I…uh…I think I'm going to lie down for a bit before we have to get ready.” she said as she forced herself to stand. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, girl, get it in while you can!” Ralph insisted through a mouthful of food. “You wanna take this with you?” He asked, holding her plate aloft.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, I’m not hungry. I’ll get something at the festival later.” She insisted. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Suit yourself!” He shrugged. </span></p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p><span>As she waddled over to the elevator each step was more painful than the last, her back and hips protesting every movement. She could feel the weight of her son pressing down further adding to the lingering pressure that was now a constant drone behind the steady rhythm of agonizing pain that no longer seemed to sneak but barrel over her. She pressed the button and was immediately greeted by the opening of the elevator doors. She stepped inside and pressed the button for the next floor and just before the doors closed Sharon managed to join her. </span></p><p><span>Sharon gave her a quick glance with a tight reserved smile then did her best to avoid Agatha’s attention. As she watched the woman Agatha couldn’t help but consider what Ralph had said. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“The food was nice.” Agatha muttered as the elevator slowly moved. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, it looks good.” Sharon replied curtly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Did you pull that together?” Agatha asked </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes, I did.” Sharon said with a quick and somewhat surprised glance to Agatha. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well, good choice then.” She complimented </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Thank you.” Sharon replied with a soft smile. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The elevator doors opened once again to a barren administrative hallway. Agatha courteously allowed Sharon to exit first and followed quickly behind her, wincing with every step. They walked in silence down the corridor until they arrived at Sharon's desk and her office. Agatha watched as Sharon moved to sit behind the desk without a word as she headed for her door, a pang of guilt now ringing in her chest and she stopped just before opening it and turned. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sharon, I… I hope I didn’t upset you earlier.” She muttered</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What do you mean?” Sharon replied, completely puzzled. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I know I can be harsh at times but I do appreciate having you around. I don’t think that any of this would have come together without you. I hope you know that.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Th…thank you that means a lot.” Sharon stuttered in shock. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha flashed her a tight, uncomfortable smile. “Don’t mention it!” She breathed as she turned back around and stepped towards the door. As her hand gripped the handle she was overcome by a freightrain of searing pain. She collapsed forward with her head against the door as her free hand came up to grip the doorframe beside her. The force with which it overtook her seized any control she had and she cried out with an agonizing moan that bloomed as it wracked her entire body. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Sharon immediately launched up from her desk, rushed to Agatha’s side and began rubbing circles on her back. “It’s ok, let it out. You got this! Just breathe through it, it’ll pass.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Slowly the claws began to release and Agatha pried herself away from the door to look at Sharon with a mix of appreciation and horror. “Sharon…” she breathed shakily, “this…this isn’t happening. It can’t be!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Sharon smiled back with love and pity as she brushed the hair away from Agatha’s face. “Let’s get you off your feet, honey, and we’ll figure it, ok?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha nodded weakly as she slowly stepped away from the door and let Sharon lead her in. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Sharon quickly cleared the things from her couch just in time for her to sink into it. She helped get her feet up from the ground and lay back onto the cushioned surface. “Alright dear, you rest here I’m going to go grab my phone.” She said as she started to head out. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, wait! What for?” Agatha barked from the couch. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Honey, I’m pretty sure you’re in labor. We should get you to the hospital.” Sharon insisted as sweetly as she could. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“NO!” Agatha shouted, the very thought of abandoning everything now was crushing and terrifying. Besides, it probably wasn’t labor, right? How could it be? It was too soon! </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Dear, I’m quite sure you just had a pretty serious contraction, I think it might be time…”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“NO! It’s NOT! …Not yet! ” Agatha gasped in panic as Sharon’s words shattered the facade she had built for herself. Sharon stared back at her worryingly as she pondered what to say. Agatha’s eyes darted around, searching, calculating, “I…I still have time. I can make it.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m sorry, dear?” Sharon asked, confused. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What time is it?” Agatha huffed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Just after four I believe.” Sharon replied cautiously. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I can make it! I can definitely make it. ” Agatha repeated more to herself than to Sharon as she adjusted to sit up as much as she could. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Make what dear?” Sharon asked, her confusion growing quickly to concern </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s only a couple hours? Right?” She laughed in a hysterical panic. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“A couple hours?” Sharon repeated, eyes wide with trepidation. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ralph will be up here soon, he can help me get ready. I’ll go out for the kick off and then…” she trailed off as her mind finally came to terms with the truth, the reality of what this day was becoming. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And then?” Sharon repeated. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Not a word of this to anyone!” Agatha snapped. “I don’t need anything to go awry before this festival starts.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Sharon shook her head in horror. “Oh…honey, I wouldn’t…you don’t have to…” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“NOT. A. WORD. HART!” Agatha cut in forcefully. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“O…ok, dear... If that’s really what you want.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha stared at her, still in disbelief “It is.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright…I guess…I guess I’ll just be out here if you need me in the meantime. I’m going to leave the door open.” Sharon slunk out, hardly taking her eyes from Agatha as she did so until the wall itself blocked her view. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>As soon as she was out of sight Agatha slumped back down onto the couch, her head dangling back as she stared at the ceiling contemplating the reality of her situation. </span><em><span>How was this happening? It couldn’t be happening! Surely it would stop again soon and she wouldn’t have to leave!</span></em><span> But even as those thoughts crossed her mind she knew it was wishful thinking. The pains had only grown stronger and more frequent as the day wore on and that could only mean one thing, </span><em><span>she was having this baby soon! </span></em><span>Sooner than she ever could have been prepared for. She wasn’t ready, </span><em><span>he </span></em><span>wasn’t ready! </span><em><span>How could either of them be?</span></em><span> </span></p><p><span>She thought about calling Rio who was currently with Jen and Alice getting ready to head over but, by her logic, by the time she told her and they made their way to the Hall the kick off would be underway as it is so why not hold out just a little longer? She just needed to make it to the kick off then they could figure this whole thing out. She knew where to find her and they could leave as soon as it was over. </span><em><span>Jen said it took hours anyway, didn’t she? She had time. She had to have time! </span></em><span>Just enough to see the tiniest fruits of success for all she had worked for. </span></p><p><span>As these last thoughts trickled through her mind a contraction began to take her. It dug its claws into her back and squeezed the very air from her lungs as her muscles constricted and bore down. She managed to roll onto her side and bury her face in the pillow before letting out another uncontrollable moan of agony. With every wave the pressure worsened, sinking further and further down. After a minute the tension eased just enough for her to catch her breath. </span><em><span>Perhaps…perhaps it was time? </span></em><span>She felt her heart cry, in fear, in disappointment, in pain. After all, how much more of this could she take? </span></p><p><span>She lay there for a moment, panting, contemplating, and urging herself to move. She summoned as much strength as she could and pushed herself to sit. She could feel the space between her hips full and heavy with where her son had already been pushed to. With a count of three and a grunt she hauled herself up from the couch and started for the door, one hand on her aching back, the other cradling the swell of her stomach. She eased out into the hallway where she found Herb and Ralph chatting with Sharon. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She’s really not feeling well, and I don’t know if it’s a good idea that she go out with you this evening. I think she really needs to rest. In fact I should probably try and give Rio a call.” Sharon was explaining. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Nonsense!” Agatha lilted as casually as she could, startling everyone with her presence. “Rio will be here later, there’s no need to rush her. I’m perfectly fine to see this through.” Agatha tried to convince not only them but herself, for in the face of doubt she couldn’t help but try to prove everyone wrong. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“See! I knew she wouldn’t let me take all the credit!” Herb chuckled. “Everything’s set downstairs, I’d expect people should start arriving within the next half an hour or so. I’ve already seen quite a few people mingling about the booths outside so I gave them the go ahead to start on their end. Take your time getting ready, I’ll be back to collect you at 5:45!” Herb flashed her an exuberant smile before heading out and down the hallway. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You sure you’re good girl?” Ralph asked as he exchanged a concerned glance with Sharon. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah! Yeah, perfectly fine, just needed to rest a bit.” She sighed, trying to smile reassuringly. “Come on, we should start getting ready. It takes twice as long as it used to.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“If you say so.” Ralph scoffed as he followed her into the office. </span></p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p><span>She shuffled over and grabbed her garment bag off the back of the couch and threw it towards Ralph as she started to peel off the button down she had put on that morning. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck that looks so uncomfortable!” Ralph gasped as she exposed her swollen belly to the room. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You have no idea!” She scoffed as she unbuttoned her pants and let them fall to the ground. “You gonna just stand there staring or are you going to help me into the dress?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Ralph shook his head, pulling him back into focus. “Right, yeah the dress.” He mumbled as he unzipped the bag revealing the bright red, flowing, floor length, chiffon dress she had managed to find. “This is cute!” He commented as he pulled it off the hanger. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And it fits, just barely.” She snorted. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright, over or under?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Over, I think.” She sighed as she waddled closer to him. He gathered up the fabric and helped slip it over her head as she slid her arms into the short flowy sleeves. He gathered her long hair out from the back of the dress and threw it over her shoulder as he started for the zipper. “Wait!” She breathed sharply as a pain started to swell again in her lower back. “Give me a second.” She begged as she began to pace breathing deeply in through her nose and out through her mouth. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah no worries! I’m just gonna start getting my stuff ready.” Ralph said as he turned to dig in his bag. </span></p><p><span>The pain was growing more intense every second and she couldn’t afford to lose her composure now, not in front of Ralph. She had to distract herself somehow, find some way to divert her focus from the pain. She bit down on the inside of her cheek as hard as she could tolerate, drawing a rush of salty iron into her mouth. It wasn’t a solution but worked for the time being to stifle the moan that was threatening to break loose. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You nervous?” He called out to her as he began throwing things onto the couch. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ah…a bit” she managed to choke out just as the wave began to settle. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ah! Don’t be nervous! Everything looks amazing, everyone showed up and they know where they’re supposed to be, which is half the battle. People are itching to get in and see it all. You really outdid yourself!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Thanks” she mumbled as a tear began to well in her eye. It was too much. It was all too much and unless she found something better than chewing on her cheek she wasn’t going to make it without falling apart at some point soon. “Alright, I…I think I’m ready, zip me up?” She asked as she quickly wiped the tear from her eye. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You got it mama!” Ralph said as he hopped up to help her. “You sure you’re ok?” He asked as he pulled her dress closed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, yeah, just tired. It’s…it’s been a long week.” She lied as her hands circled her stomach. She couldn’t tell him what was really happening for the same reason she had stopped Sharon from calling Rio. She knew as soon as any of them figured out what was going on it would all be over and she couldn’t take that chance. Not when she was so far from being ready to face this. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It certainly has! </span><em><span>Shit</span></em><span>!” He exclaimed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What? What’s wrong?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“The button just came off.” He groaned, “Well, you can take the dress off and I can sew it back on or I can safety pin it.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“There’s no way I’m getting out of this now, just pin it.” She sighed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Ralph scrambled over to his bag and withdrew a pin. He shuffled back over and started to pin her dress in place. He nearly had it before the needle popped out and jabbed her in the back of the neck. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ah! Fuck that hurt!” She winced</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sorry! Sorry! It slipped out at the last minute.” He said then chuckled to himself. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What’s so funny?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s what she said.” He snickered </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I swear you’re a fucking child!” She huffed though a smirk snuck onto her lips. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“There! All set! Turn around, let’s see! GORGEOUS!!!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’ll do.” She grunted. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Now, go sit your tired ass down while I pull my shit together.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Too exhausted to argue she waddled over and plopped back down on the couch. She let her head fall back as her eyes fluttered closed, trying to rest, relax, and prepare as much as possible before the next pain overtook her. She guided her hands along the surface of her stomach feeling the slight, soft strum of her son just beneath the surface. The barrier between them had never felt so thin. She thought of his tiny hands, how they soon would wrap around her fingers, of his little feet that had kicked and prodded her for months soon to be free flailing about in the open, of his button nose and lips that Rio swore were hers nestled comfortably into her chest. For all the fear and suffering that lay ahead she longed dearly for the other side when she could hold him in her arms. </span><em><span>But not yet, little bug! Please not yet!</span></em><span> She thought to herself. </span></p><p><span>As she sat there, dreaming about the seemingly imminent future, she felt the coil of another contraction begin to stir. She braced herself, biting her lip as the pain began to swell and bloom around her once more. As the pressure continued to build she could feel her control slipping. Her eyes popped open looking, searching for anything that might help distract her mind before it all became too much and she crumpled beneath it. Then out of the corner of her eye she spotted something shiny lingering on the surface of the sofa. </span><em><span>Another pin.</span></em><span> In this moment she would rather be stabbed by a thousand pins than suffer through what was proving to be the worst pain yet. Her hand launched out and grabbed it just as a small whimper slipped past her lips and she jabbed the pointed end hard into the palm of her hand. Though sharp and searing, it was a brief respite from the agony that was strumming through her and carried her through to the other side without a further sound. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Girl, what the fuck are you doing over there?” Ralph asked, whipping around to face her with half his makeup done. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I was trying to adjust myself and got stuck with another one of your fucking pins!” She groaned as she threw it at him.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well, keep your eyes peeled then, I’m sure they're all over the place at this point!” He scoffed as he turned back to finish getting ready. </span></p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p><span>By some miracle, as the time quickly drew nearer to the kick off, she was granted a small reprieve from the contractions. A brief window of light where her body sought fit to rest just as Ralph was set to leave her. </span></p><p><span>“You’re planning to meet us down there right? After Herb’s speech or whatever?” he asked as he headed for the door.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes! I’ll be there, now go! I can already hear people in the hall.” She urged as her heart began to race with anxiety.</span></p><p> </p><p><span> It was drawing closer now. Less than an hour and she would be downstairs pushing her way through the crowd towards Rio. Telling her that they had to leave and figure out what was going on, see why the contractions were so strong so early. It seemed like a daunting task and she worried about the kind of reaction it might receive. Yet a small spark inside her finally lit with excitement. </span><em><span>It was almost over. </span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>As she watched Ralph disappear down the hallway she caught sight of Herb sauntering towards her, proud and alight with joy. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ms. Harkness! I think we’ve done it! The hall is practically booming with excitement. I don’t think I’ve ever seen so many people here before.” He gleamed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Thank goodness for that!” Was all she could muster in reply.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You sure you’re up for this?” He checked seeing the fraying edges of exhaustion in her eyes.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Of course! I just need to grab a couple things before we head out.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sure, take your time!” Herb said as he settled into Sharon’s chair to wait. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She darted back into her office and scrambled to find her bag where she quickly fished out her keys and phone and snuck them into her dress pocket. There was no use in stalling their escape once she met up with Rio, everything else would be fine to wait in her office until she eventually returned. Armed with the items she returned to Herb.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ok, all set.” she huffed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fantastic! Then shall we?” he asked, offering her his arm in escort. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>—-----------------------------------------------</span></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><span>As they pushed through the administrative doors onto the balcony she was overwhelmed by the sounds of all the people milling about. The second floor was packed tight to where they practically had to shove their way over to the curved lip at the center that would serve as their stage. Once settled there she looked out onto the sea of red below. Every inch of the checkered marble floor was covered by the crowd of people that had gathered, save for the small roped off area in the center where the opening performance would take place. Her eyes searched the rabble for the woman who had stolen her heart and just as Herb had secured his microphone she spotted her off in the corner. An emerald in satin green shining through the throngs of fiery carmine and vermilion, her glimmering white smile beaming up at her. Her heart skipped a beat at the thought of rushing into her arms in mere minutes, letting her ease the discomfort that had plagued her throughout the day. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Then the noise of the room dulled to a whisper as the sounds of strings and horns washed over the crowd. The brief fanfare gathered their attention before Herb sidled up to the microphone to at last welcome everyone in. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and neighbors! It is my distinguished honor to welcome you all to what I am sure will become a notable tradition in our community…”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>As Herb’s words echoed into the room the brief respite she had been granted suddenly came to a screeching halt. In a breath her body surged with a desperate ache that threatened to pull her from her feet. Here, now, at the very center of the city’s attention she called on every ounce of strength within her to remain standing, silent, and smiling next to him. As discretely as she could she pressed her hand to the bannister before her, gripping it with all her might to keep from collapsing. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Through months of trial and careful preparation we have endeavored to deliver a most unique sensory experience, encouraging you to explore the depth of culture our great city has to offer…”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>As Herb droned on in his soliloquy her body was becoming a host of torture as the strain and pressure continued to build far beyond what she had experienced yet that day. She could feel her legs begin to shake and a bead of sweat drip down the side of her face as she struggled to maintain her composure. </span><em><span>A distraction, she needed a distraction. </span></em><span>Her free hand quickly dove into her dress pocket and clung to the mess of keys inside. She pressed the teeth as hard as she could into her palm as she breathed as calmly and controlled as she could manage until at last the pain evaporated and she let out a breath of relief. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“...and so, dear friends, it is without further ado that I invite you to join in the visual delights of the Ignis Nocturne accompanied by members of our very own symphony!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The crowd cheered with resounding applause as the fire performers made their way to the stage. As soon as they were set the lights dimmed and the dancers ignited their props to a resounding wave of ooos and aaahs. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>With the lights low and the audiences attention pulled elsewhere, Agatha leaned close to Herb and whispered, “I’m so sorry, I have to go. I have to find Rio.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh but my dear, the festivities are just getting started!” He protested</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I know, I’m sorry, but I must.” She pleaded with him through pain wearied eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ok then, enjoy your evening.” He replied with a sad smile. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She quickly turned, still holding on for life to the banner as she made her way back through the crowd toward the elevator. She was mere steps away when her journey was halted by the rising tide of not only another debilitating contraction but also the presence of wholly unwelcomed guests. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She stood frozen on the spot, resisting with every urge to lose her composure as three of her mothers friends strode up, blocking her means of escape. Sarah, Mary, and Winifred, devout sisters whose judgement was only matched by their cruelty. Through the blinding pain Agatha managed to gasp. “You’re…you’re not supposed to be here!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh I think you’ll find we have every right to be here.” Scoffed Mary</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“This is a public event after all.” Taunted Sarah</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And unlike your poor mother, we’ve not been banished from your presence.” Sneered Winifred. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha let out a gasping laugh of astonishment as her body continued to constrict, bearing down on her son. “What exactly are you doing here?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Enjoying the show!” Sarah cheered</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Reveling in the culture as your friend said.” Mary cackled </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And seeing what you’re up to, of course dear!” Winifred admitted with a devilish smile. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Mighty fine display of debauchery you’ve managed to conjure up.” Mary taunted. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s practically Hell, what with all the fire and brimstone about.” Winifred scoffed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And to think how ashamed your dear mother will be when we tell her all you’ve been up to.” Sarah pouted mockingly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Tell…tell her what you want. It…it doesn’t change anything.” Agatha gasped</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“For now dear girl.” Winifred glowered. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t for one second think she’s abandoned her cause!” Mary barked. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Not when there’s a poor, innocent child at stake!” Sarah warned. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>If the agonizing pain wasn’t enough in that moment, the very thought of her mother’s relentless pursuit of her son was enough to shatter the last of her equanimity. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You tell her to stay the fuck away from my son!” Agatha cried as she gasped at last in pain, a shaky hand splayed across her stomach. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh my!” Sarah gasped </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“A son she says?” Winifred lilted in glee</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Won’t Evanora be delighted by the news.” Mary chittered</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And just in time as well.” Sarah sighed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It appears his arrival is quite imminent.” Mary snickered</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Here, dear, let me help you!” Winifred said as she reached out her hand to rest on Agatha’s shoulder. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Get the fuck off of me!” She shouted. “You vultures need to leave before I call security!” She gasped as the contraction at last receded. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No need, dear!” Winifred said as she withdrew. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“We’ll go!” Mary insisted. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Just know we’re always nearby.” Sarah warned. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Should you need us.” Winifred smirked with a wink. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha scowled as she watched them recoil into the elevator. The fury that now burned inside her at their presence was just enough to send her over the edge. She couldn’t wait for the elevator. She couldn’t risk running into them again before finding Rio. She had to escape. She turned quickly, just as the lights flickered back on and the horde around her erupted in thunderous applause, and headed through the doors towards her office. </span></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><span>—————————————————</span></p><p> </p><p><span>She stumbled down the vacant hallway, tears streaming from her eyes as pain and anger radiated with every step. Of course her mother was keeping tabs on her despite the court order. She was foolish to think that would stop her? </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She pushed her way back into her office and flung her phone out onto her desk as she doubled over grasping the edges in support. Another contraction was quickly approaching and she had to reach Rio, she needed her now more than ever. Fast as she could she pulled up her contact page and pressed call. </span></p><p><span>The phone rang, and rang, and rang as her heart pleaded for her to answer. Then she heard the voicemail click over. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Hey, it’s Rio. You know how this works.”</span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>BEEP </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio…my love…I…I need you to…ahhh…AAAHHHAAGHHH…” the pain washed over her with a force so unyielding she couldn’t help but cry out in utter agony. She felt her legs begin to shake as they threatened to give out beneath her and she clung to the side of the desk with every muscle she could muster. As the torment began to falter she felt a small pop and then a rush of liquid poured down her legs. “No…no not yet…please no…I…I need more time.” She began to cry as a shaky hand lifted her skirt to see the evidence of what she expected to be true. Over the roundness of her bump she found it too difficult to see but when she pulled back her hand she was shocked to find it tinged with scarlet. She could feel her body begin to shake in shock, her breath coming in ragged bursts as her knees at last gave out beneath her. Her head began to spin as her vision blurred and she struggled to inch her way to her phone which had been launched across the room in the mayhem of her collapse. She crawled just a few feet as her arm clutched her swollen, throbbing belly before her sight narrowed until it was complete darkness and she collapsed on the floor unconscious. </span></p>

<p><span>“Come on guys! Let’s go! You can make out later!” Rio hollered from the living room. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“We weren’t making out!” Jen spat as she rounded the corner from the hallway in a hot pink pantsuit. “Sorry it took a fucking minute to wash the hospital stink off but after the day I’ve had and the fluids I’ve encountered there was no way I was going to this thing without a damn shower!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What’s your excuse?” Rio snickered as Alice trapsed out after Jen. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Jen was taking a shower, obviously I needed to be there…for moral support!” She shrugged as she straightened out her burgundy blazer. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Why am I not surprised?” Rio laughed. “Well, you look ready now, let’s fucking go before we have to park a million miles away and show up late!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Doesn’t this thing go until like midnight? Who cares if we’re late?” Jen scoffed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I do! I told Agatha we’d be there for the kick off so if you don’t mind let’s get our asses in the car and go!” Rio urged exasperatedly</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright! Alright! Don’t get your panties in a wad! I just need to put my shoes on and grab my bag then we’re set!” Jen said. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio slapped her hands to her face and slowly let them slide down to keep from losing her shit. “I’m…I’m gonna go get in the car. Just make sure the doors are locked on your way out.” Rio said in a huff as she turned and hobbled out. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Jeez, what’s her problem?!” Jen scoffed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Eh, she’s been on edge ever since the knee thing. Then of course she’s also stressed out about Agatha and the baby with this whole festival.” Alice explained</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oooo I bet she is what with Agatha’s due date being pushed up a bit.” Jen snickered</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Wait what? I thought that was just a maybe kind of thing.” Alice frowned in shock</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh no, Vicky’s pretty confident she’s probably gonna pop in the next couple of weeks, not June like they had originally estimated.” Jen chuckled as she slipped on her shoes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No shit! …Huh.” Alice huffed looking puzzled. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What huh?!” Jen scoffed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That was not the impression I got at dinner the other night!” Alice snorted</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What do you mean?” Jen frowned </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You might have been in the bathroom when we were talking about this but they were telling us about some babymoon thing they were going to do at the end of the month. I guess Rio had finally convinced her to take a few days off. Though Agatha did say they made it a point to stay in town because there was a slight chance he could show up early.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“HA! More than slight! I’m betting she’ll make it to the end of next week, tops!” Jen scoffed “Man, I knew she was in denial but damn! I swear, sometimes that woman can be thicker than a bag of rocks.” Jen tisked as she shook her head. “Well come on, we better go before lover boy out there has a conniption!” She said as she headed out the door. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Right behind you, dear!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>————————————————</span></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><span>By 5:50 they were ascending the immaculately decorated and surprisingly lively monumental staircase of Music Hall. An LED light display set the building awash in digital flames, jets of fire were bursting intermittently from the tops of pedestals and performers, clad in ornate orange and red costumes, trapsed up and down the stairway gathering everyone in for the ceremony. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She really pulled out all the fucking stops for this didn’t she?” Jen mumbled under her breath as they reached the doorway which was draped in flowing satin fabric. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She said they spared no expense!” Rio shrugged. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I cannot begin to imagine how much all of this cost!” Alice gasped as they entered the foyer. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The three stood in awe as they marveled at the transformed space. From the ceiling three floors above draped down a series of thin shimmering fabrics in reds and golds that were hung along the bannisters as they fell all the way to the ground floor and pooled in the corners of the atrium. Hung along the railing of the balcony above were tiny metal dragons that shot sparks from their mouths every so often. In the center of the floor was a small roped off area with pillars in each corner that hosted large bowls with flickering flames swirling about atop them. As they looked about at the throngs of people before them, dressed to theme in shades of red and splashes of gold, they began to mingle their way through the crowd in search of Ralph. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She should definitely be thrilled about the turnout! I don’t know that I’ve ever seen this many people here before!” Jen shouted to Rio up ahead. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I told her it was going to be a hit! She was nervous that no one would show up.” Rio called back </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That is definitely not the case tonight!” Jen chuckled. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Where did she say he was going to be?” Alice hollered from the back. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Over here on the left. He should be right by the bar!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Figures!” Jen scoffed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>They quickly found the bar where bartenders were mixing cocktails with a flourish of tricks, sending cinnamon sparks atop one drink, lighting shots on fire, and one that came in a particularly unique mug with a lip that held a small blue flame.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh shit! They’ve got feuerzangenbowle!” Alice shouted as they passed.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Did you just fucking sneeze?” Jen snorted</span></p><p> </p><p><span> “Gezundheit!” Rio chuckled</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No! It’s this German drink where they soak a sugar cube in basically moonshine then light it on fire and it melts into the drink. They usually have them at Christmas markets and stuff. They’re amazing and I’ve been wanting to try them out at the bar but the permits to do it are fucking insane!” Alice babbled to which Jen and Rio shared a confusedly amused look. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m gonna go get one! You’ll get it if you try it!” She insisted as she stormed off towards the bar. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“If you say so honey!” Jen shouted after her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“There! I think I see him!” Rio cheered at last as she pointed to Ralph on the other side of the bar, who indeed stood about six and a half feet tall with an enormous gold and ruby headdress on. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You go ahead, I’m going to wait for Alice. We’ll meet you there in a sec!” Jen said as Rio started towards him. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well, well! Hello Mami! You made it just in time!” He beamed as she pushed her way up to him. “They just made it to the podium!” He said as he pointed to the second floor balcony. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio whipped around to where he was pointing just in time for Agatha to spot her in the crowd and smile. Immediately her heart fluttered at the sight. She couldn’t ever remember her being more beautiful, radiant in her flowing Venetian red dress, the particular shade illuminating her ocean blue eyes that were so piercing they sparkled all the way down to the ground floor. Her long hair was carefully tucked behind her ear as the length cascaded down her shoulders, and being perched so high above in the balcony, glowing in the halo of the spotlight, it was as if she was a goddess that had descended from the heavens. If Rio could have sprouted wings she would have flown to her in that moment. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>All of a sudden a brief pageantry of strings and horns sounded from above and silenced the surrounding crowd. Once the music stilled Herb stepped up to the mic and began his welcome speech. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ladies and Gentlemen, friends and neighbors! It is my distinguished honor to welcome you all to what I am sure will become a notable tradition in our community…”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>She could feel the hum of excitement hovering throughout the room, among the people around her, all enchanted by the atmosphere and the eloquent tale Herb was weaving, though she herself heard none of it. Her focus was solely on Agatha, her mere presence locking her in a hypnotic trance. She watched as Agatha’s eyes zeroed in on Herb, seemingly focused intently on every word he was saying, though she likely had heard this speech dozens of times at this point. The way her smile seemed to widen almost into a grimace before she bit down somewhat nervously on her lip. She then shifted uneasily from foot to foot, inching her way to the bannister where her hand lifted surreptitiously to rest as she leaned slightly towards it. </span><em><span>Odd</span></em><span>, Rio thought. </span><em><span>Perhaps she’s tired after another long day?</span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>“Through months of trial and careful preparation we have endeavored to deliver a most unique sensory experience, encouraging you to explore the depth of culture our great city has to offer…”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>As Herb droned on she continued to study her. Beyond her beauty and radiance Rio began to notice the signs of wearied fatigue that were beginning to poke through her polished facade. Her glimmering, crystal blue eyes held a heavy exhaustion, her chest seemed to heave as if standing there required nearly all of her energy, and the gleaming smile she had arrived with had now sunken into a tight, pursed almost sneer. Then, if that wasn’t enough, she noticed her grip on the bannister had tightened to the point that her knuckles were as white as bone and her free hand had seemingly disappeared into the folds of her dress as if soothing the tempestuous motions of their son. She was more than tired, that much was clear. In fact, she seemed on the brink of collapse. Rio felt a worried tightness curl in the depths of her chest. This was too much, she was pushing herself too far and she needed to rest. She wasn’t sure how but she knew as soon as Agatha descended to greet them she would find a way to convince her to go home, at least for tonight.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“...and so, dear friends, it is without further ado that I invite you to join in the visual delights of the Ignis Nocturne accompanied by members of our very own symphony!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>As soon as Herb’s speech ceased the lights throughout the hall cast them into darkness save for the glowing bowls of fire atop the pedestals surrounding the stage. For a brief moment Rio’s attention was caught by the troupe of dancers making their way to the stage as the fifth movement of Stravinsky’s Firebird Suite rained down from the balcony above. The dancers lit their instruments in the flaming bowls about the columns and began an enchanting and spellbinding performance. They twirled and threw batons that licked at the edges of the audience. A few of them expertly extinguished flames in their mouths before carefully reigniting them. After that they began a series of acrobatic tricks where they were standing atop one another juggling flames and even tossed each other up into the air. Then as their performance neared its end additional performers rushed forwards with the edges of the draping fabric and launched themselves into acrobatic feats that carried them nearly to the ceiling three floors above. And just as the music crescendoed to its peak they unwound themselves in a dramatic plunge that landed mere inches away from the checkered marble floor just as all the fires were extinguished leaving the hall in stunned pitch black. As the lights began to rise revealing all performers unscathed in a circle facing out towards the crowd they were met with thunderous applause and cheers. Yet, in this renewed visibility, Rio’s gaze diverged from the performers to find Herb standing alone applauding on the balcony. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio looked around the balcony and saw no sign of Agatha. </span><em><span>She must be on her way down, trying to beat the crowd. </span></em><span>She told herself. She let her attention fall back to the performers who were bowing once again and she joined in the seemingly endless applause until at last they dispersed to a flurry of chatter, awe, and excitement. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So that was fucking wild!” Jen gasped as the group turned their attention inward. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, I was not expecting that! When she said there’d be performances and music and stuff I was thinking like oh, scenes on a stage or something, not fucking Cirque du Soleil!” Alice chuckled. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“They’re local?” Jen asked Ralph</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, if you consider New York local.” He scoffed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You pulling anything unexpected out of your ass later?” Jen snorted</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m not bending myself in half if that’s what you're asking, but I will have some fun costume quick changes, though after that it might be a little underwhelming.” He admitted with a grimace. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You good?” Alice asked Rio who was too busy searching the crowd for Agatha to participate in the conversation. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah…yeah, just trying to keep an eye out for her.” Rio replied as she shifted anxiously trying to see around heads and bodies for any sign of her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m sure she’ll be here in a bit. She probably just got caught up talking to donors or something.” Jen insisted</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, you’re probably right. We still cool to hang out here for a bit until she makes it over?” Rio asked</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fine by me.” Jen shrugged</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, of course!” Alice added</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don’t really have anything until my set at 10:30 so works for me.” Ralph said.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>As they waited they talked over the different events that were happening throughout the night, Ralph told them about the different vendors they would need to stop by and Alice made each of them try the flaming German drink which was met with varying degrees of disappointment. All the while Rio kept a close eye on the crowd, looking for any sign of Agatha moving about towards them. After ten minutes she grew concerned, </span><em><span>but she was probably just caught up in conversation right? </span></em><span>So she continued to wait. By fifteen minutes in, she had completely stopped participating in the conversation and was solely searching the crowd. She tried to find Herb and Sharon in the rabble but they were nowhere to be found either. </span><em><span>Perhaps they were caught up in some administrative bullshit? </span></em><span>She tried to remain calm but every passing second grew heavy with worry. Then, when the grand clock in the hall announced that twenty minutes had passed with the chime of its bells she couldn’t wait any longer and decided to search for her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m going to make a round and see if I can find her.” Rio said decisively as she began to hobble away.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’ll go with you, and maybe we can stop by the bathroom, those drinks went right through me!” Alice said as she started to follow Rio. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“We’ll wait here in case she decides to show up!” Jen shouted after them. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>They scoured the packed crowd of people that were still bustling about the hall. A few times Rio thought she had caught her out of the corner of her eye but when she would turn to try and catch her it would end up being someone else entirely. She wracked her mind trying to think of where she would have gone, </span><em><span>she had been the one to decide where to meet.</span></em><span> By the time they reached the other end of the hall and the bathrooms Rio was starting to work up a panic.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Maybe she’s in the bathroom” Alice shrugged as she pushed her way in and rushed to a stall. Rio took a deep breath, trying to calm herself enough to keep her head straight, and walked through the door in search of Agatha. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha?” She called out as she limped down the first aisle of stalls. “Agatha!?” She hollered as she rounded the corner with no response and began looking at the feet under the occupied stalls. “AGATHA!” She shouted as she circled back to the entrance</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don’t think she’s here!” Alice shouted back as she exited the stall. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well where the fuck is she then?” Rio sighed exasperatedly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don’t know man, try not to panic just yet, I’m sure we’ll find her. Maybe she’s already back by the group now.” Alice said, trying to be as reassuring as she could with wet hands. Just then, Sharon pushed her way into the restroom breezing past Rio on her way to a stall. “Sharon! Sharon, hey!” She shouted as she barreled up behind her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh…oh, hello dear!” She said a bit shaky and surprised. “What…um…what are you still doing here?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What do you mean? I came to see Agatha for her opening night. I’m actually having trouble finding her and was wondering if you might know where she went.” Rio asked as calmly as she could muster by that point.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Sharon’s eyes bulged in horror and her face turned white as a sheet. “Oh, honey! Did she not come find you after the kick off?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No?!” Rio replied as her heart started to race again at seeing Sharon’s concern. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, dear. Have you tried calling her?” She asked rather urgently. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, not yet. What’s going on Sharon?” Rio pressed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well…um…she said she was going to come find you. She’s…well…” Sharon babbled nervously </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Out with it Heart!” Rio half shouted. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She was having some contractions earlier.” Sharon admitted meekly</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She WHAT?!” Rio roared in fury and fear. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She said she would be able to get through the speech and come find you.” Sharon cowered.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“FUCK!” Rio hollered in a panic as she whipped out her phone and froze. There was a missed call from Agatha and a voice message. She could hear her heart pounding in her chest, and a cold trickle of fear drip down her spine as she clicked on the notification and began to play the message aloud. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio…my love…I…I need you to…ahhh…AAAHHHAAGHHH…” as she continued to grunt in pain, the sound of hands slapping onto a hard surface could be heard along with the crumpling of papers. Then there was a gasping breath before a sharp inhale of shock.“No…no not yet…please no…I…I need more time…I need…I nee…” the words lost their shape and fell into heavy panting breaths before there was a loud crashing clatter and then a soft muddled thud…then…nothing.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio felt a new wave of disquiet rattle her as her spine prickled with fear and her hand that held the phone began to shake. Her breath then began to fracture coming in short shallow bursts. Agatha was in pain, she was in labor, and from the sounds of the clattering at the end, in crisis. She had to find her immediately, but where? Music Hall was a sprawling campus and with the festivities about, she could be anywhere. “Fuck…FUCK!” She shouted as she began to pace. “We have to find her. We have to find HER!” She shouted as she burst out of the bathroom with Sharon and Alice closely behind. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Her eyes searched frantically as she tried to think of where to start. </span><em><span>She was up on the balcony, had she even made it down to the main floor? Could she be in the stairway? Or stuck in the elevator? </span></em><span>She started to charge towards that corner of the room and immediately saw a group exiting the elevators. </span><em><span>Not in the elevator.</span></em><span> She continued on towards the stairwell and yanked open the door as she started calling her name which echoed into the nearly empty tower. She hobbled all the way up to the second floor with Alice and Sharon closely in tow and thrust her way through the door out to the second floor balcony. Her eyes quickly scanned the sparse clusters of people mingling on this level and still saw no sign of her. She stumbled over to the balcony and collapsed against the bannister, head in her hands, as she tried to wrack her brain of where to look. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“For an injured person you are quite fast.” Huffed Alice as she and Sharon caught up to her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She has to be somewhere close, she can’t have gotten far in her condition.” Sharon insisted, causing Rio to lift her head from her hands to glare in her direction. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“WHY DIDN’T YOU CALL ME?!” She shouted as she stormed towards the woman and she cowered back.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey, Rio, chill!” Alice urged as she stepped forward to hold her back.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It was only a few hours by the time we noticed, she said you’d be here and she wanted to wait until after the kick off to tell you. I’m…I’m sorry.” Sharon whimpered shakily</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio, it’s not her fault, she didn’t know, she just did what Agatha asked her to.” Alice insisted </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“But why? Why did she ask her to do that?” Rio gasped as her rage fell to fear and teary eyed worry and turned into Alice. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I…I don’t know man. It’s ok, it’s going to be ok. We’ll find her.” Alice reassured as she held Rio for a moment. Rio quickly peeled herself away and wiped the few tears that had fallen away from her eyes as she turned away to glance at the crowd below as she gathered herself. There as she stood above the rabble it dawned on her. </span><em><span>Red</span></em><span>. All the people milling about below, clad in every shade of red one could imagine. The drapery, the decorations, the fire itself burning red. </span><em><span>What was it Lilia had said? </span></em><span>She tried to rack her brain to remember the exact phrasing. </span><em><span>When you lose her in the red sea…look for the silver lining</span></em><span>. Silver! But what silver? Her eyes darted around the room searching for anything that could remotely be considered silver, but the only other color she could see against the red was gold, not silver. She turned to Alice and Sharon as she began muttering to herself. “Silver…silver…”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Silverrr…what?” Alice asked as she exchanged a confused glance with Sharon.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Something silver, silver lining…” Rio muttered in explanation</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re making no sense.” Alice said as she stared at her dumbfounded. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio continued to search, bringing her gaze up to the second floor where they were standing. She turned slowly scanning the room, and that’s when she saw it. The back hallway to the administrative offices. Nearly the only area in the entire hall that wasn’t decked out in a fiery motif. Instead it glowed with a single silver blue light that radiated off the silver metal frame of the doorway that closed it off to the rest of the building. </span><em><span>Of course! </span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>“Her office!” Rio gasped as she stumbled in that direction</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What?” Sharon asked as she and Alice began to follow</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Her office! She’s in her office!” Rio shouted as she made it to the doorway. She pushed in on the bar, hoping to release the lock but found it unwilling to budge. “Fuck why is this locked? It’s never locked!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s because of the festival. We didn’t want just anybody wandering back there.” Sharon shrugged.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sharon, please, please tell me you have a key!” She gasped urgently</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I do! I have my key card!” She yelped excitedly as she dug through her hand bag to pull it out and grant them entry. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>They rushed in as soon as the door gave way and Rio ran down the hallway, as fast as her knee would allow her with Alice and Sharon even struggling to catch up. In the blink of an eye she made it down the hallway and around the corner and up to Agatha’s office door which was held ajar. As she reached a trembling hand for the handle her heart was racing so fast she thought it might explode from her chest. She burst through the door with Agatha’s name on her lips and was halted in shock as her gaze caught her unconscious body lying in a heap on the floor in front of her desk. Her long hair splayed wildly around her, the bottom of her dress dark and stained with what she hoped wasn’t blood though the room was tinged with the smell of iron. As quick as she had stopped she lurched forward collapsing onto the floor beside her, her hands grasping at pulse points and eyes searching for any signs of life. She quieted, barely letting out a breath until she felt a faint thrumming pulse at her wrist and saw the slow shallow movements of her chest as she breathed. She closed her eyes and let out a small sigh of relief, </span><em><span>she’s alive! She’s still alive! </span></em></p><p><span>It wasn’t until she heard a sharp gasp and an “</span><em><span>Oh shit!”</span></em><span> behind her that she realized Alice and Sharon had made their way into the room. She turned sharply towards them with a shuddering breath.</span></p><p><span>“Sharon…Sharon!” She shouted, pulling her attention from Agatha’s limp body. “Go call 911! Then go outside and wait for them to arrive!” She commanded to a stunned Sharon. “Go! Now!” she yelled, spurring her into action.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alice! Go…go get Jen!” She urged, trying to hold in the gravity of her panic.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Y…Yeah, you got it!” Alice replied as she bolted from the room. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio turned back to Agatha’s unconscious body and rolled her over to her back before gathering her face between her hands. She could still feel her faint pulse thrumming through her arteries though her skin was cold and clammy. She brushed her hair away from her face as she called at her to return to consciousness. </span></p><p><span>“Agatha, Agatha baby please! Come on, don't do this to me. Come back! Wake up! Wake up please!” She pleaded with tears stinging her eyes as she patted her hand against her cheek. After a moment that seemed to stretch on forever Agatha’s eyes rolled back into focus as she took in a deep gulp of air. </span></p><p><span>“R…Rio?” She croaked out, barely more than a whisper. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio let out a heavy sigh of relief as she fell forward pressing her face into the crook of Agatha’s neck. “Oh thank the gods!” She gasped as she held her as close as she could. “You’re ok, you’re ok!” She began to repeat as she sat back up and took in more of the scene, her free hand darting around unsure of what to do or where to check next. “You’re going to be ok!” Agatha reached out, stilling Rio’s anxious hand as she pulled it in close to her chest. “Agatha, what happened? Are you in pain? Sharon said you were having contractions.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes.” Agatha gasped as tears quickly drew to her eyes and began pouring down her face. “Rio…I’m sorry! I’m so so sorry! I…I thought I had more time!” She sobbed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s ok, don’t worry about that right now! We’re getting you help. Sharon called the paramedics and Alice went to go find Jen.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio, the baby! There’s something wrong! Ahhh…AGHHHH…AHHHHH.” She gasped just as another contraction took her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Come on baby, breathe! You got this!” Rio coached as Agatha struggled through the pain before gasping for air as it passed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio…it hurts!” She cried “it hurts so much!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I know! I know Cariño, you have to fight through it and stay with me! Ok?” She begged as she pulled Agatha’s head into her lap and began stroking her hair comfortingly. They sat in silence for a moment as Agatha breathed heavily with tears still streaming down her face, coming down from the gut wrenching agony. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It broke!” She sighed through sobs </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What did?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“My water, it broke and there…ahhh…and there was….AAAGGHHHHH” Almost immediately another contraction gripped her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Shit! That was fast!” Rio gasped in shock. “I…I should probably be timing this!” She said as she searched for her phone, eventually pulling it out of her jacket pocket and immediately started a timer. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Just as the second contraction crested Jen and Alice burst through the door before quickly skittering to a stop at the scene. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fucking Hell!” Jen shouted</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh good she’s awake!” Alice sighed in relief </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes but she’s in fucking labor! Jen do something!” Rio pleaded</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Shit! Right!” Jen said as she shook her head and jumped into action, settling herself at Agatha’s feet. “How close are the contractions?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I just started timing but not very far apart. She said her water broke.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck…ok…ughhhh…yeah it definitely did.” Jen groaned as she noticed the fluids on Agatha’s dress and legs. “Alright…Agatha, I have to check you.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What?!” Agatha gasped in exhausted shock. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I need to see what’s going on. Just trust me alright?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha gave a reluctant nod before Jen dove under the layers of her skirt and pulled off the blood soaked remnants of her underwear. “Fuck!” She gasped as she threw them to the side, out of Agatha’s view, as she and Rio exchanged a quick concerned glance. “Gods, I hate that I’m not wearing gloves right now! Is there like hand sanitizer or anything in this fucking room?” Jen shouted as she sat back on her heels. Rio and Alice began to search frantically just as Agatha screamed out again in pain. Rio immediately turned back to hold and comfort her through it as Alice threw Jen a bottle of hand sanitizer she found in one of Agatha’s desk drawers. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright what’s our timing look like?” Jen asked as she slathered herself in sanitizer. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>As Agatha settled again on the other side of the contraction Rio frantically searched for her phone and found it sitting beside her. “It’s…shit, just over a minute.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck! Ok…ok…” Jen breathed as she psyched herself up. “I’m going in, just try to keep breathing, ok?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What the fuck do you think I’m doing?!” Agatha whimpered, clutching at Rio as Jen pressed forward and she winced in pain. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh…OH…ok then.” Jen muttered before she withdrew her hand tinged with blood. “Can I get a towel or a cloth or something?” Jen asked, holding her hand aloft. Alice rushed around to dig through Ralph’s bag and pulled out a hand towel. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Jen, how we looking?” Rio asked urgently as Jen toweled herself off. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Exactly how you’d expect with the contractions that close. He’s knocking on the fucking door.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What do you mean?” Agatha gasped in panic as her focus bounced between Jen and Rio who were exchanging knowing glances. “What does she mean?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Jen rested her hands on Agatha’s knees as she turned her worried yet insistent gaze towards her. “Agatha, on the next contraction, I'm gonna need you to push.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha’s heart sank as her body began to shake in the throws of shock, exhaustion, and adrenalyne. “WHAT?! No…NO! I…I can’t…it’s…it’s not time…it can’t be…I’m…I’m not ready.” she began to cry.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha, you don’t really have a choice.” Jen insisted with a sorrowful lilt to her voice</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Can’t…can’t we wait for the paramedics?” She begged as she felt the tendrils of another contraction begin to tighten. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Jen shot a quick look to Rio before turning back to Agatha, “Agatha, I’m not trying to alarm you, but you’re bleeding, quite a bit. I don’t know where it’s coming from but there’s a chance your baby could be losing oxygen and we need to get him out, now! He’s right there, he’s ready, so when you feel the next contraction you have to push, ok?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha gave a shaky, defeated nod as she reached back for Rio who moved to have Agatha rest against her chest, arms around her sides, their hands entwining into fists as the contraction deepened and she began to push. She bore down with all her might as the pressure continued to build, constricting every muscle in her body as the pain tore through every cell in her body. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Come on, baby, you got this! That’s it!” Rio cheered her on as she pushed through the last of the contraction and collapsed back in a fit of gulping, heaving breaths. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio…I…I can't, it's too much!” Agatha whimpered as her head fell back onto Rio’s shoulder</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes you can! You’ve got this! I’ve got you, now just breathe.” She urged as she rested her head against Agatha’s cheek. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha lay there for a moment, chest heaving as Rio held her, before rising her head as another contraction came barreling towards her. She took a deep breath and held it as she curled forward and started to push. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s it girl! Just like that!” Jen coached as Agatha grunted furiously, pushing with every ounce of energy she could muster. The pain was searing as it continued to build and she could feel the pressure growing more and more intense as her son made his way further and further down. Just when she thought she might collapse in exhaustion the contraction released and she cried out with a whimpering breath. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“AH! It burns…Rio it hurts… it hurts so fucking much!” She cried as Rio cradled her in her arms and wiped the sweat away from her forehead. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I know, I know, Carino! You’re doing so well! You’ve just got to keep going, you’re so close!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha, you’re doing great! You’re beginning to crown, just a few more pushes like that and he’ll be here!” Jen encouraged. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You hear that, baby? He’s almost here! Just a few more, you can do it!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“This…this isn’t what I wanted! It wasn’t supposed to happen like this!” Agatha sobbed through heaving breaths.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I know, baby, I know, but we’re here now and you’ve gotta push through! I’m right here with you! You can do this!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She gave a few more heaving breaths before she righted herself and began pushing once again. The pain was white and blazing hot as if it was burning her from the inside out. The pressure between her legs became nearly unbearable as it threatened to split her in half and she cried out in a guttural, primal fury as her legs began to shake. She paused for a moment, catching her breath and gathering every bit of might and power she could as she dug into the depths of her soul to begin pushing again. She fought, pushing hard through to the end of the contraction and as it eased she could, for the first time feel a slight release from the pressure that had only been building up until that point. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re doing so good, girl! You are so close, his head is out. Take your time, catch your breath, when you’re ready you give me everything you’ve got and we’ll get this baby out of there!” Jen cheered encouragingly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>In the wake of the last contraction Agatha lay slumped in Rio’s arms as her chest heaved for air. She could feel a tingling lightheaded sensation as her vision began to grow spotty. She let her eyes flutter closed as her body succumbed to the brief bit of rest she was being granted and she began to drift towards the edges of unconsciousness once more. </span></p><p><span>Seeing her begin to slip, Rio gathered her face in her hands and urged her to wake, “No…no, come on baby! Hold on, please! You’re almost there! I can see him! I can see our son!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio…I…I can’t…I don’t have anything left. I can’t do any more! ” She whimpered breathlessly as she struggled to keep her eyes open.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes you can! Just one more! One more and he’s here! You can do this, baby! You are so strong! Jen’s got him, all you have to do is give one more push.” Rio coached</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“One more?” she huffed as she glanced down at Jen</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“One more, girl! You can do it! Dig deep! Don’t quit on me now!” Jen prodded lovingly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“OK…” she breathed as she readied herself with the next contraction.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Let’s go! You got this, Agatha!” Alice cheered from her seat on the couch beside them. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha centered herself as much as she could then took a deep breath in before she began pushing once more. In that moment it was as if her soul left her body and she was nothing but a pure, raw primal force pulling on the very fibers of humanity to deliver her son into the world. As Jen eased him out the scream that tore through her shattered what remained of the person she was before, but on the other side, bloodied and bare, exhausted and drained and limp in Rio’s arms, she was born anew. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“He’s here! Agatha, you did it!” Rio cheered as she held Agatha close and tears began to well in her eyes.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha breathed out a soft, relieved laugh as she slowly lifted her heavy head to look at Jen, who had her son stretched over her lap. </span></p><p><span>“He’s here…is…is he ok? I…I don’t hear anything.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The room stilled as if all the air had been sucked out and they looked intently at Jen who was patting urgently on his back trying to get him to breathe. </span></p><p><span>“Come on buddy, you’re on the other side, take a breath!” she muttered as she continued her ministrations.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Jen, what’s going on?” Rio finally asked with a nervous waiver to her voice. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I…I don’t know! He’s…he’s not breathing.” She admitted as she tried to remain calm.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Jen…please!” Agatha sobbed as she watched her urgent actions take no effect. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m trying! It’s not working!” She replied, her voice raising slightly. “I need suction, I think his airway is blocked but we don’t have anything here! We aren’t exactly in a hospital!” She groaned, growing fearful and frustrated.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Here, give him to me!” Rio urged as she reached across Agatha to take him from Jen. His little head fit perfectly in the palm of her hand as his body draped against the length of her forearm. She placed her mouth around his tiny nose and mouth and sucked out the blockage, spitting it on the floor beside her before placing him on Agatha’s chest. Agatha held him close as tears began to stream down her face.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Come on! Come on, just take a breath!” Rio pleaded in a muttering beg as she stroked the back of his head with her thumb.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Please, little bug! Please just breathe!” Agatha sobbed as he lay still in her arms. </span></p><p><br/><br/><br/></p><p><span>The room fell silent and somber as the seconds passed until a soft mewling whimper broke through the haze. At the noise they all sighed as the fear and tension vanished. Agatha gasped in relieved shock as she felt his hands and feet start to move against her skin. </span><em><span>He was alive!</span></em><span> Tears of relief and joy burst forth, streaming down her face before spreading to everyone about as they listened to his growing cry. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“He’s ok! Rio, he’s ok!” She sobbed as she looked up into Rio’s waterlogged eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“He’s more than ok, my love!” She said as she pressed a kiss to Agatha’s forehead. “He’s perfect!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Jen! You did it!” Agatha gasped through her crying.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That was all you two! I just caught him. Fuckin, House over here saved his life!” she scoffed.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You did! Rio, you really did!” She sighed through shaky tearstained breaths. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I just did the only thing I could think of. I’m just glad it worked.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re a fucking hero man!” Alice cheered as she gave Rio a hardy pat on the back. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I…I feel cold.” Agatha breathed as she began to shiver. She could feel her limbs growing weaker as the faint fuzzy feeling quickly returned. She fought to keep her eyes open but the edges of her vision were starting to fade.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck! I need more towels or cloth or anything!” Jen shouted “She’s still bleeding!” Alice rushed to hand her every fabric within reach which Jen pressed up against the wound. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha? AGATHA!?” Rio shouted as she watched Agatha’s eyes roll into the back of her head and her body begin to shake. She carefully slid out from behind her and grabbed the baby, wrapping him in her jacket, before Agatha succumbed to a full blown seizure. Just as they were able to roll her onto her side the door burst open and the paramedics rushed in taking over.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sorry, it took forever for them to get up here through the crowd!” Sharon gasped in the doorway, clearly having run the entirety of the hall to get there. “There’s more coming up the elevator with a stretcher!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Thank you Sharon! You might have just saved her!” Rio sobbed with the baby in her arms. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“M’am, we’re gonna need to cut the cord so we can move her.” said one of the paramedics as they dug through their bag. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, of course, I can get it!” Rio sniffled as she rifled through a pocket, pulling out her switch blade and severing the cord as the baby wriggled, crying in her arms. Jen rushed over and tied the loose end in a knot as the paramedics turned their full attention to Agatha. Moments later a stretcher was brought in which they moved her onto.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Do you want to go with us or do you want me to take the baby?” Asked another paramedic as they began to wheel her unconscious body out.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’ll go! I’ve got him, I’ll go with you!” Rio insisted as she started to follow them.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“We’ll be right behind you guys! We’ll see you at the hospital!” Jen called after them as she started to gather their things. “Fuck, I am never going to get to wear this pantsuit again after this!” Jen groaned, seeing the damage that had been done.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s a shame! It looks really good on you!” Alice sighed, “Maybe you can convince Agatha to buy you a new one after all that!” she shrugged</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“If she makes it out of this a new pantsuit is definitely on the table.” Jen chuckled though her laugh was hollow. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You think she will? Make it out of this?” Alice asked, seeing her worry.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I really hope so.” </span></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><span>—--------------------------------------</span></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><span>Rio hovered in the back of the elevator, clutching the baby now settled into her chest as she watched the team work to stabilize Agatha. They’d strapped an oxygen mask to her face as they collected vitals all the while her head hung to the side with her hair dangling over the side of the stretcher and her eyes remained closed. She was angry, furious that it had gotten that far. That Agatha had pushed herself over the edge to where she gave birth to their son on the floor of her office and now…now it seemed as though she was slipping away. She didn’t get to do that to her! Make her love her so deeply and then leave, nearly destroying them all. How could she live? How could she survive without her? How could she care for their child without her? It wasn’t fair! She needed her! They both needed her! She had to pull through, but would she? </span></p><p><span>As they exited the elevator into the surprised crowd she heard a faint whimpering sound at her chest. </span></p><p><span>“It’s ok, little bug!” She hummed as she followed the stretcher. “Mami’s got you, you’re ok. Mama…mama’s going to be ok…I hope.” </span></p>

<p><span>When they arrived in the emergency room that night Rio found herself caught in the maelstrom of doctors and nurses jumping into action as they raced her off towards surgery to try and stop the bleeding. Almost as soon as she had been wheeled out through the doors there was a nurse at Rio’s side prying the baby away from her arms as she stood in shock and worry. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Tiny little thing isn’t he?” The nurse had said as Rio stared numbly at his fragile body, afraid that if she looked away he might stop breathing. “Just 5lbs and 16.25 inches.” the nurse announced.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, he’s a bit early. He…uh…I believe he’s starting to show signs of RDS. He’s been having trouble breathing.” Rio mumbled to the nurses who were getting their initial checks.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You are, aren’t you buddy? Poor thing! Don’t worry, Delaney’s getting your oxygen ready then we’ll take you up to the NICU.” The nurse said gently as his little chest heaved and he began to make little grunting noises. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are you mom’s friend, sister?” Asked the woman who was seemingly in charge. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No! I’m her fiancee! This is my son!” Rio growled rather sharply</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh…oh I’m so sorry! I didn’t mean to assume. We’re going to take him up to finish getting checked out. I’d like to send you out to the information desk so we can keep you updated about your fiancee. We should be able to get him settled in the next hour or so and can have them let you know where to come check on him when he’s ready.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“NICU…third floor.” Rio mumbled, still in shock, still staring.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Y…yes actually…how did you…?” The nurse frowned in confusion</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I work here. Very familiar with that wing actually.” Rio answered flatly</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, good! Well…not good…but you know where he’s headed at least.” The woman babbled, seemingly incapable of keeping her foot out of her mouth. “And I’m sure you know the team here is gonna take great care of him!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No doubt.” Rio grunted dryly as they started to wheel him away. She followed along behind him until they passed through to a restricted area where they had to part ways. Though her heart ached at the separation she knew, even if she had had her credentials, it was best to give the team space to stabilize him. Besides, she did need to head to reception and give them her information so they could keep her updated on Agatha, when she was out of surgery and what room she would be taken to. Eventually she pulled herself away from staring at the closed doors and headed for reception. As soon as she pushed through to the other side she heard Jen and Ralph’s voices hurry towards her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio! Rio! Hey! How are they? How is she?” They asked as they rushed to her side, Jen still in her ruined hot pink pantsuit and Ralph still decked out in his drag best, though he had removed the headdress. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“They…uh…they just took him up to the NICU, he was having trouble breathing. Agatha…Agatha was being prepped for surgery. They couldn’t stop the bleeding on the way in and…and her blood pressure was starting to drop.” She managed to choke out through the lump in her throat.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Shit!” Jen gasped as she clasped a hand to her mouth </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I…I uh, I have to go…” she cleared her throat “go check in at the desk…so they can give me updates.” Rio muttered as reality was starting to set in. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Do you want us to go with you?” Alice offered. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Would…would you come with me?” Rio asked Alice directly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah for sure! If you guys wanna have a seat we’ll come find you.” Alice instructed as she guided Rio away. They took a few steps across the room and lined up behind an irritated looking woman. “How are you doing?” Alice asked gently to a particularly stunned Rio, still covered in the remnants of what now felt like a living nightmare as she stared blankly at the head in front of her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I…I don’t really know right now.” She mumbled, not breaking her stare as her mind continued to race over everything that had happened and everything else that might, trying not to let the despair seep too far into her consciousness. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fair enough. I’m sure you know this but we’re here for you too, just as much as we are for Agatha.” Alice muttered caringly.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Thanks, Alice.” Rio replied a little teary eyed before they fell into a patient silence as they waited for their turn at the reception desk. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>After what felt like hours but was closer to 30 minutes they had confirmed Agatha was actively in surgery and redirected the group to the surgery waiting area down the hall and around the corner. There they took Rio’s phone number and gave her a patient ID to track her progress on the large TVs on either side of the room, as if they were in a macabre airport. They all quickly settled into a nervous quiet, Jen and Rio pacing back and forth, narrowly missing each other each time they crossed paths. Alice had curled herself into a ball in a chair beside Ralph who was leaning forward onto his knees as his legs bounced restlessly in his red and gold sequined dress. After nearly an hour with no update Rio circled back to the surgery desk.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How can I help you?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I…uh…just wanted to see if there was any news on this patient.” she asked as she slipped them the paper they had given her. “I have a baby that was admitted to the NICU but I don’t want to leave and miss something.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Let me check with the nurse and see if I can get you any info.” The man said as he walked back to call the nurse’s station.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“If you want to go check on him we’ll stay here and wait for any updates.” Alice offered as she walked up to stand beside Rio. “I can send Jen up if we hear anything.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Thanks. I’ll see what the nurse says and we can go from there.” Rio sighed nervously as the man returned.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She’s still in surgery, they said they can send someone out in a couple hours to give you an update.” </span><em><span>A couple hours? </span></em><span>It felt like an excruciating eternity, the thought of not knowing, not being able to do anything to help. She felt the tightness in her chest clench further with this news.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Great. Thank you.” Rio replied solemnly as she and Alice returned to the others.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Any update?” Jen asked, her eyes wide with concern.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“They said it’ll be a couple hours before we hear anything.” Alice replied, seeing Rio begin to retreat into herself again in worry. “I think we might go and check on the baby. You two ok to hang out here for the time being?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah! Yeah, of course! I’ll come get you if we hear anything!” Jen replied reassuringly as she resumed her pacing. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Come on, let’s go check in on the little guy.” Alice suggested as she draped an arm around Rio and led her out into the hallway. They wandered into the main entrance as Alice looked around, trying to get her bearings.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Third floor.” Rio mumbled as she started to lead them to the elevators. They shuffled in along with a host of medical staff, a patient in a wheel chair, and a dad with two small children clinging to his legs. As they rose Rio could feel her stomach start to sink. She had been in this elevator countless times and thought nothing of it, but now with Agatha in an indefinite surgery and on her way to see her own son in the ward she had sent many of her own patients to, the box felt hollow and crushing all at once. As the elevator announced their arrival on the third floor she and Alice squeezed their way through the small crowd and headed down the hallway towards the NICU. As they approached the reception desk Rio caught sight of a friendly familiar face. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Dr. Vidal! I didn’t know you were working tonight! I thought Dr. Jones was on duty.” chirped Gloria, the nurse receptionist she had passed by a hundred times before.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey Gloria.” Rio mumbled as she tried to force a smile but it only made her look more weary and dismayed. “I…I’m actually here as family. Patient’s name is Harkness.” She could feel her stomach drop like a stone in water as the words left her mouth. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, dear! I had no idea! Let me see if they’re ready for you.” Gloria said as she bustled about back into the wing.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Of course, take your time.” Rio sighed as she turned to Alice with a panic now rising in her chest. “Alice I…I don’t know if I can do this.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Do what?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I feel sick, and dizzy.” She groaned as she leaned against the wall. “I know what I’m about to walk into and I…I just don’t know if I can see him like that. It breaks my heart just thinking about it.” She groaned as tears began to prick her eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio, I’m…I’m so sorry! I can’t begin to imagine what you must be feeling right now! We can come back later if you’re not ready to do this yet. I just thought it might put your mind at ease to see that he’s alright at least.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I thought so too. But now I…” Rio was cut short as Gloria returned.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“He’s all set back there, sweet little thing! Are you ready to head back?” Rio gave a quick glance to Alice before taking a hard swallow, gathering whatever courage she could muster, and nodded to Gloria. “He’s in bay 3.” she noted as she opened the doors for them. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio walked cautiously forward as the familiar cacophony of beeps and whirring called her in. She knew every corner of this facility but in the grip of fear and anxiety it all had a haze of unease that further unsettled her. It felt like stepping into the twilight zone. The frigid glow of the overhead lights sent a shiver down her spine and prickled her arms with goosebumps as she eased closer and closer to bay 3. As her eyes landed on the incubator she felt the lump return to her throat and tears return to sting at her eyes. Just beyond the glass she could see his tiny body splayed on the striped hospital blanket awash in the glow of the incubator lights. A series of wires and pads were stuck to his little chest as it rose and fell in a calmer rhythm than she had last seen. They had fashioned a little blue cap to his head and a tiny cpap machine was attached to his face. His eyes were closed and he seemed at ease in a peaceful slumber. Though it was indeed jarring at first, Rio felt a wave of relief at seeing him safe and sound, which surprisingly released the floodgate of tears she had been holding in from the moment they had arrived. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Look at him!” She sobbed to Alice as her hands rested on the glass. “He…he looks good, better than I expected. He’s already got his color back!” She breathed through a teary smile.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“He looks great! Handsome little guy!” Alice chuckled as she rubbed a comforting hand along Rio’s back. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ugh! He looks so peaceful. Miles better than when we got here.” she sniffled.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey! Dr. Vidal!” called another familiar voice. “Gloria said you were in here. Is this one really your’s?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey Holly. Yeah, this is our guy.” Rio sighed as she dried her eyes.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh my gosh! Congratulations! I knew you guys were getting down to the wire but I didn’t realize how close!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, closer than we realized I guess. He…uh…he seems to be doing well. Already breathing better.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh yeah! Carly and I got him hooked up as soon as he got here and started the surfactant therapy about an hour ago, he’s already doing much better.” Rio’s chest eased further at that news.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Did everything else check out alright? Any other issues?” She asked as her gaze drifted back down to the sleeping child.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, he’s perfectly fine otherwise. As long as he continues to improve I’d say he may only need a day or so of therapy before he’s breathing on his own. How’s your girlfriend doing?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She…uh…she’s in surgery now, so we’re…we’re still waiting to see.” Rio admitted solemnly </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh my gosh! I’m so sorry! I…I didn’t realize” Holly gasped in worry</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s ok. I know she’s in good hands, it’s just very nerve wracking with him here and her…”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh of course! I can’t even imagine! If you need anything please let us know!” she insisted</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Thanks Holly, I appreciate it. Is…is it alright if I touch him?” She asked cautiously as her gaze bounced back to the incubator. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, of course! You know where the sanitizer is, I’ll go grab you a chair.” She said as she rushed off to the other side of the room. Rio shifted past Alice and took a dollop of hand sanitizer from the dispenser mounted on the wall before squeezing back next to the box. “Here you go!” Holly said as she rolled up a chair behind her. “Take as much time as you need.” she said with a comforting smile before stepping away to manage another patient. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio tucked her good leg underneath her as she sat and brought a hand up to open the porthole by his feet. She carefully slid a hand in, brushing the edge of his tiny foot with the back of her fingers causing him to flex his toes and pull his leg back. She let out a small laughing gasp in astonishment. She was reminded of all those times she had snuggled against Agatha’s bump, feeling him twist and squirm beneath her skin, and now here he was, still somewhat of a barrier between them, but she could touch him, feel the softness of his skin and see his legs kick about at her touch. She delicately unlatched the other porthole by his head and snuck her other hand inside, grazing his plump little baby cheek with the tips of her fingers. </span></p><p><span>“Hey there little bug!” She hummed tearily as her finger wandered down to press at the palm of his tiny hand which quickly curled around it. “You made it! They’re gonna take good care of you here. Holly’s the best. And I’ll be here, Mami’s got you.” She said as she rested her head against the box and let her eyes flutter closed as the tears began to stream down once again. She was so grateful, he was indeed safe and sound and well taken care of, yet her heart ached at being unable to hold him, only able to graze her fingers along bits and pieces of his fragile body. She longed to swaddle him close, feel his tiny breath against her skin, the only piece of Agatha she could touch in this purgatory of agonizing waiting. The not knowing, the waiting, not being able to do anything for either of them was creating a burning ache in her chest that she didn’t know how to extinguish. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She sat there for another hour or so, not breaking contact as she studied every detail about him. Meanwhile, Alice had drifted off to sleep in a chair nearby, her head resting against the wall. A string of drool began to drip out of the corner of her mouth just before she was startled awake by a hand gently shaking her knee. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Shit! Jen! You scared the crap out of me!” She gasped as she stretched herself awake. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How’s he doing?” Jen asked as the commotion caught Rio’s attention. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“He’s doing alright.” Rio hummed as she cupped a hand around his tiny head. “Any news?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“They said they’re going to send someone out to give us an update. I thought I’d come grab you if you’re ready.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah…yeah. Just…uh…just give me a minute I’ll meet you out in the hallway.” Rio sniffled, turning back to the baby as Jen gathered Alice and they headed out into the hall to wait. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright, little bug. I have to go see how Mama’s doing. I promise I’ll come back as soon as I can, ok? You be good for them while I’m gone.” She sniffled as she withdrew her hands and pressed a kiss to the glass. “Mami loves you sweet boy.” She muttered as she stepped away at last, tears once again pricking at the corners of her eyes. </span></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><span>As she walked out into the hallway, teary-eyed, Alice and Jen flanked her, wrapping an arm around her shoulders and waist in a hug as they guided her over to the elevators. None of them said a word as the car descended back to the first floor, the air was too thick with worried anticipation and Rio could sense the sinking feeling return as she stepped out and headed back down the hall to the surgery waiting area with Jen and Alice in tow. As soon as they entered the receptionist popped up from behind the desk and led them into another room off to the side where Ralph was already waiting. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“They should be in shortly to speak with you.” The man said as he closed the door behind them. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Did they say who was coming to talk with us?” Rio asked as she began to pace the length of the small room.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, but I’m guessing it’s the surgeon.” Jen replied, her leg bouncing anxiously</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Do you know who was on duty tonight?” Rio asked as she began to pick at her nailbeds</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No clue.” Jen muttered as she interlocked her fingers with Alice’s, who sleepily leaned her head against Jen’s shoulder. The room fell into a hushed anticipation, each of them too anxious to breathe properly as the time stretched on and on. Then, at last, there was a soft knock at the door. Their heads snapped up at the noise and Rio stepped forward to answer. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Woah! Full house!” said the surgeon as he stepped into the room. “I’m Dr. Stark, just to make sure I’m in the right place, you’re the family of Agatha Harkness, correct?” he asked as he looked at his chart.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes, I’m her fiancee, how is she?” Rio practically barked at him</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It was touch and go there for a while but we’ve finally got her stabilized. Are…are you all family? I only ask because of HIPPA…”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes, that’s her sister and her wife” she said pointing to Jen and Alice, “and he’s the father of the baby!” Rio spat, “Now, tell us what happened!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh…ok, alright! Just needed to be sure. It appears she had a placental abruption that was causing her to hemorrhage. It was a struggle to remove the rest of the placenta so we could find the source of the bleeding but in the end we were able to locate the source and cauterize it. In the meantime she required several transfusions before the issue was finally resolved. Given the amount of blood loss and the seizures…”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Seizures? She had more seizures?” Jen gasped</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“One as we were prepping her for surgery and another right before we found the source of the bleeding. Given that, we’ve elected to put her into a medically induced coma and she’ll be transferred to the ICU for the time being so we can closely monitor her recovery. These next few days are going to be critical so we want to make sure we can provide the care she needs. She’s very lucky she got here when she did, if it had been even a few minutes later we might be having a very different conversation.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio stood there stunned and numb as the reality of what he was saying slowly seeped into her. Agatha was stable, but just barely by the sound of it. She had come within a breath of losing her forever and that truth was crushing. She felt the slightest trickle of relief that Agatha had survived but the river of fear at the fragility of the next few days was nearly drowning her dry. </span></p><p><span>“When…when can I see her?” Rio choked out as tears leaked once again from the corners of her eyes. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“The anesthesiologist and the rest of the surgery team are getting her ready to transfer now, as soon as we have her set in the ICU we’ll let you know what room she’s in and you can see her, though they may only let a couple of you up at a time since it’s after visiting hours.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Right, of course.” Rio mumbled as she wiped her raw, tear stained cheeks dry once more. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Do you have any other questions for me?” He asked. Rio shook her head along with the others. “Alright, hang tight. We should have her settled within the hour.” He said before making a quick exit. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fuck!” Jen gasped as her head flopped into her hands. </span></p><p><span>“Holy shit!” Alice snorted in disbelief as she banged her head back against the wall.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“At least she’s alive.” Ralph mumbled hopefully</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“At least? Dude she’s in a fuckin coma!” Jen spat</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I get that! I’m just trying to stay positive. It could be worse!” He groaned back at her</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Not by much!” Jen growled</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Guys! Shut up!” Alice scolded them as her gaze fell to Rio who was silent, still staring blankly at the closed door. “Rio? How are you feeling?” Alice asked cautiously as she rose to stand behind her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She’s ok…” Rio whispered to herself as she squeezed her soggy eyes closed. “She’s ok, she’s going to be ok, she has to, she has to be ok…” she continued to repeat quietly under her breath, hoping if she said it enough it would dispel the very real fears that loomed in the back of her mind. She could feel her spine prickle with dread as Alice placed a comforting hand on her shoulder, breaking her from her meditative focus and pulling her back into the horror of what was actually happening. Her chest clenched in panic and she could feel her limbs start to tingle as her breath became trapped in her lungs. As her eyes shot open they darted around the small room catching the stares of everyone watching her begin to come apart. It was suffocating, the room, the attention, the knowledge that Agatha had only just survived. It all seemed to close in on her at once. She turned quickly, fumbled with the door handle as her hands began to shake, then swung it open wildly as she stormed out through the waiting room and out into the hallway with the other three following closely behind. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>She rushed through the lobby, narrowly avoiding several other patients and hospital staff as she barreled through the exit doors out onto the sidewalk of the receiving bay, all the while struggling to catch her breath as the panic seemed to seep further. She continued down the sidewalk and around the corner where she could feel her legs begin to wobble as her mind began to swim in a dizzy lightheadedness. She stumbled sideways, catching herself just barely on the side of the building as her body succumbed to the hysteric fear that was growing inside her and sank to the floor. Her head fell back against the cement structure as she tucked her knees in close to her chest feeling it heave as her heart pounded furiously throughout her body. She closed her eyes once again as the tears streamed out from the far corners of her eyes and she exhaled deeply, trying at last to calm herself as best she could. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio?...RIO?” She could hear them calling for her as their hurried footsteps grew closer. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She’s over here!” Jen shouted as she rounded the corner. “Hey, Rio, you ok?” she asked, crouching down as the other two rushed up behind her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, I’m not fucking ok!” She heaved, glaring at Jen. “I….I…I almost lost her…I..I still might!” she sobbed. “I knew…I knew this would happen!” she wailed as she tucked her head against her knees. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You did?” Ralph asked, confused.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I told her! I told her to take it easy…she was pushing herself too hard… and now look! Look where we’re at! She nearly killed herself!” Rio screamed as she collapsed back against the wall. “I…I should have done something! I shouldn’t have let her do this stupid festival! I should have taken her away when I had the chance! Then maybe none of this would have happened!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No! No, don’t do that to yourself! There’s nothing you could have done!” Alice cooed, settling beside her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I could have insisted! I could have taken better care of her!” Rio cried</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio this isn’t your fault!” Jen insisted as she shifted to sit in front of her. “Should she have taken a step back? Probably, but knowing Agatha that was never going to happen. And even if by some miracle it did this still could have been a possibility. Even under the best of circumstances shit can go sideways quickly. Don’t blame yourself. If anything you saved them both!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah that shit you pulled in her office to get him to breathe? Fucking heroic dude!” Alice lauded</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And the way you took control and had Sharon call the paramedics when she did, it clearly saved her life!” Jen praised. “I know this is a horrific nightmare right now but you will get through it, both of you. You know how excellent the staff is here, they’re going to take great care of her and help her make a full recovery.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And that baby of yours is strong as hell and will be breathing on his own in no time.” Alice added</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And we’ll be there for you, both of you, whatever you need, every step of the way.” Jen insisted with a comforting smile.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Y..yeah?” Rio shuddered, coming down from the peak of her wailing. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Of course dude! We’re family after all!” Alice chuckled</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, her sister? Really?” Jen snorted</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I mean…practically. It was the first thing that came to mind.” Rio shrugged as her mouth twitched in the shadow of an amused smirk.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“We’re just lucky he didn’t give it a second thought!” Alice scoffed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“He was probably too afraid to question it with the crazy eyes Rio was giving him!” Ralph snorted. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, you looked like you were about to rip him apart!” Alice chuckled</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I almost did.” Rio huffed. “I’d waited long enough at that point.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Touchè!” Jen chuckled. “Well, I don’t know about you but I for one have had enough of sitting on what may be the most disgusting surface I’ve come into contact with today, and considering earlier, that’s saying something.” Jen groaned as she moved to stand. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And since I didn’t get a chance to try any of the food trucks and all I had was that feuerzangenbowle, I am absolutely starving!” Alice grumbled as she rose and helped Rio up from the ground. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And I refuse to walk around a hospital barefoot but if I don’t change out of these shoes soon I might combust.” Ralph groaned.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How about this, now that she’s relatively in the clear, Ralph, you and I can run back to their place and clean up a bit. You can get out of whatever that sequined monstrosity is and I can stop wearing this biohazard of a pantsuit. Rio, we’ll bring you back some fresh clothes and toiletries and shit since, let’s face it, you’re not leaving this place any time soon, and you and Alice can hunker down in the cafeteria until she gets assigned a room.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That sounds like a plan. Thanks, Jen. I guess I probably should try to eat something, I haven’t touched anything since lunch earlier today.” Rio admitted</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, we should definitely get something in you, it might help you feel a bit better, relatively speaking.” Alice shrugged</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh and while you’re there can you make sure to feed Scratchy? I’m sure he’s climbing the walls right now.” Rio added as she and Alice started to make their way inside. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, absolutely! Pretty sure he’d kill us if we didn’t” Ralph snickered as he and Jen started heading towards the cars. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“We’ll let you know when we’re headed back. Just send us an update when she has a room!” Jen hollered after them to which Alice gave her a thumbs up.  </span></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><span>Still in somewhat of a delirious haze Alice and Rio wandered up to the hospital cafeteria where they scrounged to find the most edible looking items from the remnants that were left. Alice built herself a smorgasbord of snack foods while Rio settled on a soup that had been sitting in the warmer for way longer than it should have, the warmth of which soothed a bit of the aching nausea that was still plaguing her. Neither of them spoke as they tucked into their meal, opting to let the tension breathe as they ate. Then, as Alice finished her fourth bag of chips, Rio got an automated text from the hospital.</span></p><p> </p><p><em><span>Patient 016931031 has been transferred to ICU bed 333</span></em></p><p> </p><p><span>As her eyes flitted across the glowing screen Rio could feel her heart skip a beat as a fresh wave of anxiety washed over her. </span></p><p><span>“She has a room.” Rio muttered as Alice tilted the bag over her head, dumping the crumbs into her mouth. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Nice! You ready to go see her?” Alice asked as she crumpled the bag in her hands</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes…and no.” Rio replied as she stirred the spoon in her half eaten soup. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Understandable.” Alice sighed. “There’s no rush. We can go whenever you’re ready.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio stirred her soup silently a few more times before she responded. “I don’t know that I’ll ever be ready. It was hard enough seeing him in the NICU when I knew what to expect. With her…I…I don’t even know how to prepare myself.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don’t think you can. Which, I know, isn’t particularly helpful, but it’s the truth. It’s probably going to be overwhelming, let it. Don’t try to avoid it. You’ll be no good to either of them if you bottle this up.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Putting that psychology degree to good use I see.” Rio smirked</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey, it’s gotta come in handy sometimes doesn’t it?” Alice snorted</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fair enough. I guess there’s no point in delaying it any further then.” Rio mumbled as she grabbed her soup container and pushed herself up from the table. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Right behind you man.” </span></p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p><span>They walked silently into the elevators and pressed the button back up to the third floor. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“At least they’re close together.” Alice muttered.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio quirked a solemn smile. “Silver linings, huh?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Silver linings.” Alice repeated</span></p><p> </p><p><span>They stepped out into the now barren hallway and walked through the ICU waiting area, up to the reception desk there. After a brief security check they were granted entry and the large mechanical doors clicked to unlock and swung open. With it being after midnight the lights in the ward were dimmed, a smattering of nurses hovered at the station in the center as the rooms splayed out in a circle around them. They passed by a few rooms where the curtains were drawn, the mumbling of a TV could be heard behind one, behind another was the moaning and crying of a tired and confused man. Then they arrived at 333. Rio stilled before the curtain, the sounds of monitors beeping and the wooshing of a ventilator seeped through the thin divide. She drew up a shaky hand, clutching the rough fabric and took a deep breath as she pulled it to the side. </span></p><p><span>There, splayed in the middle of the hospital bed, highlighted by the empty glow of the under lights with dozens of wires strung off every limb and a breathing tube strapped to her face was Agatha. Her color was pale and sallow, her cheeks hollow and her eyes closed, heavy and dark. Her long hair was woven like a dark shroud around her, half matted and dripping off the edges of the bed. </span></p><p><span>Rio’s heart dropped and her breath stuttered at the sight. She slowly crept into the room and up to the side of the bed. Her hand reached out as she neared the edge and grazed the tips of Agatha’s fingers. They were cold, clammy and felt almost lifeless. Rio startled at the touch, then her gaze lifted, fixating on her pallid expression. She raised her hand drawing it to Agatha’s cheek as she grazed her thumb against the surface. It too was disturbingly cool to the touch. She bit her lip back as she felt the tears begin to swell once again. She leaned forward and pressed a kiss to the crown of her head before resting her forehead against Agatha’s. </span></p><p><span>“Oh, my love.” she whispered against her temple. “I…I thought I’d lost you!” she gasped as the emotions that had been building through the night finally overcame her. “You’re…you’re going to be ok…You’re going to make it through this…you have to.” she whimpered as she drew her fingers through her hair. “I need you…our son needs you.” she sobbed as the words sent a dagger through her heart. “I saw him, I saw our boy…He’s beautiful…Agatha, he’s perfect… I wish…I wish you could see him too.” she could feel the pain in her chest tightening with every word. “You will, you will see him. You’ll get through this, baby. And I’ll be right here...” she sobbed as she collapsed into a pool of tears around her, holding her as close as she could manage. </span></p><p><span>Cautiously Alice walked up beside her, laying a caring hand on her back as she grieved Agatha’s condition. Slowly Rio rose, drying her raw face as she turned to Alice. </span></p><p><span>“It’s…it’s worse than I expected.” She shuttered “Seeing her like this, and I can’t do anything. It’s torture.” Rio groaned </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m so sorry, Rio. I wish there was anything else I could say to make this easier for you. But truely, I am so, so sorry.” Alice said as she gathered Rio in a hug just in time for her to dissolve into a puddle of tears. They stood there for a moment as Rio finally released all of the pain she had been holding in since they arrived. Eventually the storm of grief passed and she pried herself from Alice’s embrace. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“This fucking sucks.” Rio huffed as she dragged the back of her hand across her face. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It does, but it’s not forever. She will get through this.” Alice offered reassuringly</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Gods I hope so. I… I don’t know what I’d do if I lost her after all of this. I don’t think I could survive.” Rio shuddered</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t even think of it! She’s going to be fine. I’m sure she’s through the worst of it.” Just then Rio felt her phone buzz in her pocket. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, Jen and Ralph are back.” She sniffled.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You rest here.” Alice insisted as she started to head out. “I’ll go down and grab them.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Th…thanks Alice. For everything.” Rio sighed as Alice gave her a comforting smile and dipped out behind the curtain. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Now alone, Rio turned back to face Agatha’s battered, vacant form. Though the sounds of the machines told her that she still clung to life it was clear by her appearance that it was only by the skin of her teeth that she did so. It felt as if at any moment she could slip beyond the vale leaving Rio forever. With that fear in mind Rio returned to her side and eased her way onto the bed next to her, careful not to disturb any of the equipment as she did so. She rolled onto her side, cradling Agatha’s body as best she could. Rio rested her head in the crook of her neck as her fingers threaded themselves with Agatha’s, mindful of the IV line as she did so. If this indeed was their final night together Rio would cling to her until her last breath. </span></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><span>—----------------------------------------</span></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><span>She didn’t remember falling asleep, nor anyone returning, but as her eyes blinked open with the morning light streaming in through the blinds she caught sight of Jen and Alice snuggled tightly into a recliner in the corner. And as her mind adjusted to consciousness she heard the steady beeping of the medical devices around her, signaling that Agatha had at least survived the night. She slowly raised her head and examined her in the fresh light. Though she still appeared pale and fragile, Rio could feel a warmth that had begun to return as she grazed a thumb along her cheek. She let out a small sigh of relief as her eyes fluttered closed and she rested her head against her cheek. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Suddenly her stillness was broken as the curtains scraped to the side and a nurse walked in. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh! Sorry, hope I didn’t wake you! Just need to do my final rounds before shift change.” she whispered, creeping around Jen and Alice as they slept to get a read on the machines. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, no, not at all. I was already up.” Rio yawned. “How is she?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Doing well so far. Her vitals stayed steady throughout the night. No major issues. The doctor’s making his rounds now so he should be in shortly. He’ll be able to give you a better update on where she’s at and the timeline moving forward.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Amazing, thank you! What time is it, exactly?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Just about 7. Is there anything I can get you before I head out?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, no I should be fine. Thank you.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Of course! I know this is the last place you want to be right now so if there’s anything we can do just let us know.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I appreciate that! Will do.” Rio sighed as the nurse left and she snuggled back into Agatha’s side. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Morning.” She heard Jen hum from the recliner beside her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Morning.” Rio sighed with a smile</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How’s she doing?” Jen yawned</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She’s still alive. The nurse just said the doctor would be by in a bit to give us a better update. You guys didn’t have to stay.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It was like 1:30 by the time we got back up here. There was no way I was driving home at that point only to wake my ass up and come check on you two in the morning. How are you doing?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Better after some sleep.” Rio yawned</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Glad to hear it.” Jen groaned as she stretched her way out of the chair. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Knock knock!” Called a voice before the curtain swiftly swung open, startling Alice to wake. “Oh wow! We’ve got the whole crew here!” Admired the doctor as he sauntered into the room. “Hope your stay wasn’t too unpleasant!” He chuckled to which they all glared at him. “I’m Dr. Banner, the attending. I understand we had a rather eventful evening?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Jen and Rio side-eyed each other. “You could say that.” Rio groaned, irritated by the chipper casualty he addressed them with. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It looks like things have calmed down a bit post surgery, though. Our vitals have remained stable, organ function looks good. Looks like the seizures have stopped as well. All good signs!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Glad to hear it.” Jen scoffed, unamused by his demeanor. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m going to take a quick look at the incisions and make sure there isn’t any additional bleeding.” He said as he snapped on a pair of gloves. Rio slid off the edge of the bed and made her way over to stand by Jen with her arms crossed as they skeptically watched his examination. “There’s definitely a bit of swelling but I don’t see any additional or continued bleeding which tells me we’re on the right track.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No shit!” Jen snickered under her breath as she rolled her eyes.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So with that in mind, here's kind of our plan moving forward. Dr. Stark wants to keep her under for 24-48 hours, depending on how things go, to limit as much stress as possible so her body can focus on healing. We do have her scheduled for a CT scan later to reconfirm that everything internally is still in good shape. After that we’ll likely reduce the sedation a bit to check her general responsiveness and overall progress.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What kind of complications are we looking out for?” Jen asked</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Any sign of infection or sepsis, blood clotting with the transfusions, then of course organ damage. So far she’s not showing any signs, but it is a little early to say we’re completely in the clear. ” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“When do they have her scheduled for the CT scan?” Rio asked </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Looks like 1:00. And the sedation vacation should be around 2:30.” They all stared at him stunned and unamused. “Any other questions?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, I think we’re good.” Jen replied dryly</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright! Well you folks have a good day!” He said rather cheerily as he scooted out of the room. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What the fuck was wrong with that fucking guy? Sedation vacation? Read the room dude!” Jen groused </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“He’s young. Hasn’t honed his bedside manor yet.” Rio replied flatly</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No shit! I was so close to wiping that fucking smile off his face. Does he think this is some kind of joke or something?” Jen spat</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“He was probably just trying to lighten the mood.” Alice suggested. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It didn’t lighten shit! If anything it pissed me the fuck off!” Jen barked </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sounds like someone needs her morning coffee!” Ralph chuckled as he pushed his way through the curtains carrying a tray of coffees and a bag of food. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“More than you know!” Alice snickered as she grabbed the drinks from him and handed them out. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How’s our girl?” Ralph asked, unpacking the bag of food. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Not completely in the clear but improving according to Dr. Smiley.” Jen grumbled before chugging her iced latte. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Dr. Smiley?” Ralph frowned amused</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Don’t ask.” Rio and Alice groaned in unison as they tucked into their breakfast. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“How’s the kid doing?” Ralph asked through a mouthful of breakfast burrito. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Shit! I meant to go back and check on him last night but I passed out. I…I need to go.” Rio said as she set down her food and started to head out before Jen stopped her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Girl, chill. He’s fine. Eat while you can. We can go and check on him in a bit. Besides, you should probably change out of those nasty ass festival clothes at some point.” Rio glanced down, only now realizing she was still in her dress pants and button up from the night before. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“A shower probably wouldn’t be a bad idea either.” Ralph added. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Last night was a lot. Agatha and the baby are taken care of and safe, you gotta take care of yourself for a bit.” Alice reminded her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio said nothing but a soft smile tugged at her lips. Slowly she made her way over to grab her breakfast and sit at the edge of the bed as the others settled into comfortable conversation around her. </span></p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p><span>After a satisfying breakfast, a quick shower in the staff locker rooms, and a fresh change of clothes thanks to Jen, Rio was beginning to feel like a person again. She swung back by Agatha’s room to check on her before heading to see the baby. Alice and Jen, having found their favorite murder doc series on the TV, were more than happy to keep Agatha company while she popped out for a couple hours. Ralph, on the other hand, practically jumped at the chance to go with her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m like the only one who hasn’t met him yet! Which I think is rude considering he has like half my dna or whatever.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s not our fault you were busy shaking your plastic tits while Agatha was squeezing him out.” Jen scoffed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I was with Sharon flagging down the ambulance! There was no way they were gonna find her in that crowd! I, on the other hand, could have been spotted from space and cleared their path on the way in.” He bragged, defending himself.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You do know how to clear a room, I’ll give you that!” Jen snorted. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Whatever. So can I go? Pretty please?” Ralph begged</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah of course.” Rio laughed, shaking her head at their antics before leaning down to give Agatha a kiss goodbye. “I’ll be back in time for your CT scan, my love.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Can she hear you?” Ralph asked, perplexed. To which Rio shrugged as she headed out of the room. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Later bitches! I’m going to meet the baby!” He said as he started to follow her out. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“By daddy!” Jen teased </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ew! I hated that!” </span></p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p><span>As they approached the reception desk Rio found herself filled with more excited anticipation than the dread she had carried with her the night before. With the reassurance that Agatha and the baby were both healing and on their way to recovery she had a renewed sense of calm about their situation. As the doors to the NICU swung open and she stepped inside she could feel a spark of joy ignite in her chest at returning to her son, this was only heightened by Ralph’s buzzing anxious excitement as he followed her in. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You nervous?” She asked as they rounded the corner. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“A little bit.” He admitted “I want to make a good first impression!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m sure you will.” She chuckled, “though I doubt he’ll remember it.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“He probably won’t, but I will.” He laughed nervously. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>With a beaming smile on her face Rio approached the incubator. “Hey little bug!” She cooed down at him through the glass. “How you doing? I missed you!” She hummed as her eyes grew misty watching him squirm as she spoke. He seemed more lively than the night before. “I brought a friend to come meet you.” She glanced over her shoulder to Ralph who was standing cautiously several feet back. “What are you doing?” She laughed. “Get over here!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sorry! It seemed like you two were having a moment!” He said as he crept forward. He craned his neck as he approached and his eyes grew wide in shock as they landed on the baby. “Woah!” He gasped </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What?” Rio snickered</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I…I don’t think I’ve ever seen a baby that fresh before! Granted this probably the third baby I’ve </span><em><span>ever</span></em><span> seen but damn! It’s wild! He’s so tiny!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, he’s pretty small. That’ll change quickly. It’s hard to believe seeing him now but in a year he’ll be running circles around all of us.” Rio chuckled as she imagined chasing the tiny being around in the back yard. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fucking wild! Do they ever let him out of this box?” Ralph asked, his eyebrows scrunched in concern. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio chuckled, “Eventually, yeah. Until he’s breathing on his own they keep him on lockdown.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So you can’t like hold him or anything?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, not yet.” She sighed wistfully. “But you can touch him. Give him a little handshake.” Ralph looked at her skeptically “if you want.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You sure?” He asked as Rio moved to get some sanitizer. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, it’s fine, I promise.” She assured as she opened the porthole. Ralph slathered himself in sanitizer then eased his hand towards the opening but stopped just before entering. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m nervous, I don’t want to break him.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You won’t break him!” Rio laughed. “Just be gentle, you’ll be good.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Ralph took a deep breath then slowly pressed his hand inside. He gently snuck a finger into the palm of his tiny hand causing the little digits to clasp around it. “Woah!” He gasped as his eyes grew wide once more. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Pretty crazy huh!” Rio chuckled </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“This is insane!” He huffed, in awe</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You did that, man! For Agatha…and for me.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It was nothing…” he replied half in a daze of amazement. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It was everything. Really Ralph, I can’t even begin to thank you for what you’ve given us.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You don’t have to. Just take care of them, like I know you will. If the last, what, 36 hours have shown me anything it’s that you are going to be a bomb ass parent and Agatha is so fucking lucky to have you!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Thanks Ralph.” Rio replied as a soft smile danced across her lips.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey buddy! Nice to meet you.” Ralph murmured as he wiggled his finger in the baby’s hand. “I’m your uncle Ralph. Despite what your moms may think, I’m here to tell you, you got your good looks from me!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don’t know about that!” Rio scoffed. “If anything he inherited your instinct for dramatic flair.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You certainly did make quite an entrance didn’t you?” He chuckled. “What’s his name?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I…uh…we…well we hadn’t really settled on one.” Rio stammered, somewhat nervously.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Seriously?” He scoffed as he whipped his head around to glare at her in shock. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha said she was narrowing it down but she didn’t tell me to what.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So he just doesn’t have a name?” He asked, arching his eyebrow, not hiding his judgement. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I mean technically no, not yet. Agatha can decide when she wakes up.” Rio insisted</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So what have you been calling him? Baby?” Ralph laughed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I mean according to the hospital he’s baby boy Harkness until she names him. But, he’s…he’s just little bug. That’s what we’ve been calling him at least.” Rio explained</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Little bug?” He repeated, eyebrows raised in skepticism as he turned back to look at the baby. “Eh. I can see it. He is kind of squirmy. Well, nice to meet you LB!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey Dr. Vidal! Holly said you’d probably be stopping by.” Called a friendly voice, drawing their attention. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey Summer! Yeah, had to come check on the little guy. How’s he doing?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Dr. Jones was in here about an hour ago. Said his lung function has significantly improved. They’re taking him down to just nasal cannula and looking to try some formula later this afternoon.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Seriously? What time?” Rio gasped in shocked excitement.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Probably around like 4:00 if you wanna stop by and help.” Summer offered</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh absolutely!” Rio practically shouted at her in joy. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“After everything we’re gonna take it slow and see how he does throughout the night with the feedings but you should be in the clear to hold him tomorrow.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Really?” Rio asked, starting to get choked up. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah really! He may have been early but he was ready!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What…ah…what time tomorrow?” Rio asked, trying to clear the frog from her throat. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’d say if you want to stop by after shift change in the morning I can get you two set up.” She smiled excitedly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“8:00?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“8:00 is perfect!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio dove forward gathering her in a hug. “Thank you! Thank you so much!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Of course!” Summer laughed. “Anything for you Dr. V!” She said as Rio finally released her. “I’ll see you this afternoon?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“See you then!” Rio called as she left to tend to a patient. “Ah! Did you hear that?!” Rio yelped with glee as she turned back to Ralph. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“He’s a champ! Fucking miracle baby!” Ralph cheered as he brushed a finger along the baby’s cheek.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Feeding tonight then I’ll hold you in my arms tomorrow! AH! Mami’s so proud of you little guy!” She cheered before she quieted and a painful thought tugged at her heartstrings. “I wish Agatha could be here for this.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I know.” Ralph sighed. “She will be, soon enough.”</span></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><span>After another hour or so of ooing and awing over every movement and sound the baby made, Rio and Ralph reluctantly left to grab a bite to eat before heading back to Agatha. Jen and Alice dipped with Ralph to get some rest at home while Rio remained with her as they took her for the scan. The CT scan went off without a hitch and confirmed the doctors findings from earlier, the bleeding was stopped and hadn’t resumed. As soon as they settled her back into the room the anesthesiologist and Dr. Stark arrived and began weaning her sedatives. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She should start to wake within the next hour. If you want to go grab some coffee or a snack we can come get you when the check is complete.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Thank you, but I’d prefer to stay.” Rio said as she shuffled to Agatha’s side. “I need to be here when she wakes up.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“While I understand the inclination, I really must insist. Though I’m sure the results will be positive, the process can be quite distressing.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“As a medical professional myself, I understand that and am prepared for that potential outcome.” He started to protest before Rio cut him off. “Don’t fight me on this. You will not win.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fine.” He groaned. “All I ask is that regardless of what happens you don’t try to interfere.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You have my word.” Rio said as she resigned herself to the recliner next to the bed. </span></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><span>Rio sat and watched carefully as the minutes ticked by. For a good while Agatha remained still and silent, the only sounds in the room being the wooshing of the ventilator, the beeping of the machinery, and the heavy drumbeat of Rio’s heart in her ears as she waited for any sign of consciousness. After what felt like ages she saw the tips of her fingers begin to twitch and she heard the nurse call Dr. Stark to attention. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She’s beginning to wake.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Very good. Ms. Harkness, can you open your eyes for me?” he asked as he leaned over the head of her bed. Rio watched with bated breath as her eyebrows scrunched slightly and her eyelids began to flutter. She seemed to struggle for a moment before finally her eyes cracked open revealing her hazy blue orbs. As they began to search the room a look of fear and confusion overtook her face. Rio stood at the periphery, hoping her presence might bring her some comfort. “Good. You’re safe. You’re here in the hospital and you have a breathing tube in. Try to remain calm as best you can, ok?” She blinked back at him as her face scrunched further in discomfort. “Can you squeeze my hand?” He asked, to which she responded weakly with the action. “Very good…”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Her heart rate is climbing.” signaled the nurse.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are you feeling any pain?” she nodded slightly as a tear crept out the corner of her eye. “Let's give her 2 milligrams of morphine IV push.” He indicated to the nurse. “You should start to feel better in just a moment. Now, I want you to try and take a deep breath for me.” Her eyes began to widen in panic as her hand came up to grasp at the tube. “No, no, that’s going to stay in place for now. Just breathe around it.” She took a gasping breath in as her chest began to heave. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Respiratory rate 18, tidal volumes good, she’s triggering the vent well.” said the nurse as she monitored.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Very good. I just want you to keep breathing for me.” Dr. Stark continued his checks as Agatha’s eyes began to dart around the room, taking in her surroundings but never quite landing on Rio. As she did so Rio could see a sense of panic begging to rise within her. Her hands began to wander to the wires and lines attached to her then she tried to pull at the covers around her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ms. Harkness try to remain calm, just focus on breathing.” Dr. Stark urged to no avail. Rio held her tongue and her position as she watched Agatha struggle to come to terms with what was happening. She had promised the doctor she wouldn’t intervene but every fiber of her being was aching to comfort her.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Her blood pressure is rising.” The nurse warned. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Let’s go ahead and resedate, I don’t want her going into cardiac arrest.” He ordered. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>The nurse moved to administer the medication and just as Agatha’s panicking eyes finally caught sight of Rio they fluttered closed again. Rio bit the inside of her cheek as she fought to hold back the tears that were threatening to spill. It was harder than she thought, but in the end she was glad she had stayed, Agatha at least knew she was there. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ms. Vidal…”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Dr.” Rio corrected. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Dr. Vidal, as you can see she’s not quite ready to come out from under sedation. Her body is still weak from the blood loss and she’s in quite a bit of pain, though breathing wise I’m happy with where she’s at. For the time being she’ll remain intubated with partial support to relieve stress on her cardiovascular system, though if we’re able to keep her relaxed enough tomorrow during our check I'm inclined to extubate.”  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She might be more relaxed if she knew I was here with her.” Rio grumbled</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“We can see during tomorrow’s check, but this type of agitation is common when waking up from that level of sedation. For now we’ll just try to keep her comfortable.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What time?” Rio murmured as her gaze fixated on Agatha.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“As long as I’m not roped into a surgery I should be by around 1:00.” He said on his way out. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright. Thank you doctor.” Rio mumbled as she wandered back over to Agatha’s now limp form. She eased onto the bed beside her, brushing her fingers along her hairline as her other hand grasped at her palm. She leaned forward and pressed a teary eyed kiss to her forehead and as she did so she felt a soft squeeze at her finger tips. “Oh, my love.” Rio sighed solemnly “ I’m right here with you. You’ll get through this.” </span></p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p><span>As the time drew nearer to 4, Ralph returned to keep watch over Agatha while Rio left to go feed the baby. Her heart was still heavy at leaving her beloved after the traumatic awakening earlier that day but she couldn’t bear the thought of missing out on their child’s first milestone. </span></p><p><span>For the first time since their arrival she slunk into the NICU alone with a spark of joy that was just beginning to shine. As she wandered up to his incubator which was now open exposing him to the room. She immediately noticed his little face beaming back up at her. The CPAP had indeed been replaced and she could at last see the details that had been hidden by it. His plump little cheeks and tiny button nose which held the cannula supporting his breathing. His mouth was scrunched in a cute little pout that instantly reminded her of a face Agatha would make when she was being bashful or begrudgingly amused. </span></p><p><span>“There you are, little bug! Miami’s so happy to finally see you!” She cooed as she reached a hand down to cup around the top of his head. At the touch and sound of her voice he turned, opening his eyes to blink up at her. Though they still had the misty sheen of a newborn she could see a shimmer of Agatha’s icy blues staring up at her and her heart clenched in bitter sweet joy. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey Dr. V! You got here just in time!” Summer lilted. “I just got his formula ready.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ah! Amazing! Where do you want me?” Rio practically squealed </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’ll have you come around to the side here.” She instructed. “And if you want to put a hand under his head there we’re going to prop him up just a bit.” Rio flexed her fingers nervously then gently scooped her left hand under his head as she lifted it up. The size of it barely matched that of a softball in the palm of her hand. He squirmed a bit as his arms flung out in reflex before he quickly settled.”Perfect! Just like that. Now, here’s the formula.” She handed over a bottle the size of a large syringe. “Just go slow, we’ll see how he takes it.” Rio eased the bottle towards his face and as she brushed the nipple against his lips he opened wide and immediately began to suckle. “Look at that! He’s a natural! You both are!” Summer praised.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You are! Aren’t you, little bug!” Rio cheered as her eyes grew misty. “Mami’s so proud of you!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’ve gotta run and check on another patient. Holler if you need anything.” Summer lilted as she crept away.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio blinked away the wetness from her eyes as she watched him drink. She couldn’t help but be in awe of the tiny creature blinking back up at her. After all they’d been through he had recovered well and was progressing quickly. She ached for Agatha to reach the same fate, to have her by her side soaking in these life changing moments. She hadn’t thought of it before but seeing him now she wondered, </span><em><span>what would happen when he was released?</span></em><span> It seemed like sooner rather than later he would be freed from the NICU, but Agatha, after her brief bout of consciousness earlier, seemed further behind and likely to linger in the hospital at least for a while. </span><em><span>What would she do?</span></em><span> She couldn’t leave Agatha but the idea of managing a newborn through her recovery in the hospital seemed daunting and ill advised. She pushed the thought to the back of her mind for the time being, determined not to let her fears spoil the joy of the moment, but she knew as soon as she left she would have to come up with a plan. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Just as he finished the last of the bottle Summer returned to help relieve her. “I told you! He may have been early but clearly he was ready.” She said as she gathered the bottle and handed over a blanket. “If you want to roll him over we can try and burp him a bit before he lays back down.” Rio rolled him onto his side with the blanket in front of him to catch any dribble and began to pat his back. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“He’s so quiet!” She noted as she watched him start to fall back to sleep. “Has he been like this the whole time?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“For the most part, yes. He got a little fussy when we were putting the tubes in but he settled back down pretty quickly. He’s just been taking everything in.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Is that right? You being a good boy? Not giving them any trouble?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“He’s pretty perfect! Just gotta hope it lasts.” Summer chuckled just as he let out a tiny burp. “There, that should be good if you want to lay him back down.” Reluctantly Rio eased him back down onto the bed and pulled her hand away. “You’re welcome to stay as long as you like. I’m out of here at 7 and I think Holly will be back in for the night shift.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’ll probably dip out once he’s asleep but I’ll be back bright and early tomorrow morning.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Awesome! I’ll see you then!” Summer smiled and waved as she stepped away once again. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio turned and looked back down as she grazed her fingers along his forehead. She watched as his eyes blinked back at her, growing heavy as sleep quickly tugged at him. Her mind swirled with a mix of pride, and hope, and fear at the coming days but that was drowned out by the love that swelled in her heart as he drifted off to sleep. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>————————————————</span></p><p> </p><p><span>The next morning she woke with the dawn as she peeled her face from the side of Agatha’s bed. Though her body ached from sleeping in a seated position, her mind pricked with excitement as the moment she had been waiting for quickly drew nearer. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Today’s the day, carino.” She hummed as she placed a kiss on Agatha’s cheek. “I get to hold our boy! He’s doing so well, I wish you could see him. He’ll be out of here before we know it.” She murmured as she brushed her fingers through Agatha’s hair. “And you will too, my love. I hate to leave you, but I have to go get ready. I’ll be back, though. I’ll be here when you wake. For now, Ralph is here.” She said, glancing over at the snoring pile of clothes in the recliner on the other side of the room. She crept past his sleeping form and readied herself for the moment she had been anxiously awaiting.</span></p><p><br/><br/><br/></p><p><span>At 8:00 on the dot she was through the doors of the NICU, practically vibrating with excitement. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Morning Dr. V!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Morning Summer! How’s my boy?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Holly said he did great last night, the other feedings went well. I just got him changed so he’s all ready for you! If you wanna grab a seat I’ll bring him over.” As quickly as she could Rio settled into the nearest recliner and readied herself as Summer gingerly lifted him from the incubator. She could feel her heart begin to race with excitement as she drew nearer and nearer. She leaned down and carefully placed his tiny body against her chest and quickly wrapped a blanket around them both. She could feel his hands and feet squirm against her body as she struggled to adjust and he started to let out a soft whimper. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Shhh, shhh, it’s ok, little bug. Mami’s got you.” She hummed as her hands moved to wrap around him. She soon felt his head relax onto her chest and she leaned down to kiss him with tears pooling in her eyes. “Oh, little one! You have no idea how long I’ve waited to hold you in my arms.” She sighed as a stray tear broke free. “Te amo mucho, mi pequeño bichito.” She rocked gently as she savored the moment, feeling at last like a small piece of her was healing through this ongoing trauma. She closed her eyes and hummed a soft lullaby she pulled from the depths of her childhood memories, a small piece of her mother that until then had been lost to time. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>An hour quickly passed before Summer was back to check on them. “How we doing?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I don’t think I can ever move again.” She sighed as she brushed a thumb along the back of his head. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I can’t blame you, you two look pretty comfy!” She chuckled. “It is getting close to feeding time though. I’m happy to bring the bottle over if you want to feed him again.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh, absolutely!” Rio nodded vigorously. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You got it. I’ll be right back.” Summer chuckled as she stepped away. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You hear that, little bug? Feeding time!” She hummed as she pulled him away from her chest to cradle him in her hands. His little arms wiggled in shock but quickly settled as he blinked back up at her. It was then that she noticed he had no breathing assistance. There were still a few cords attached tracking his vitals but he was breathing free and clear on his own. “No oxygen?” She gasped as Summer returned</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, we took him off just before you got here.” She smiled as she handed her a blanket and the bottle.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“And he’s doing alright?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Everything’s stable. As long as he keeps this up he’ll be transferred to the nursery tomorrow morning.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Tomorrow?!” Rio gasped, half excited, half terrified. “You hear that bug? You might be graduating tomorrow! When do you think he’ll be cleared to leave?” she asked as she began to feed him.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well, technically he’d be cleared to go home but they’ll need to finalize the paperwork before they can let him leave. They’ll need his name for the birth certificate and social security.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh right.” Rio sighed, dismayed at this hiccup. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“But we’re not going to rush you. I know mom is still recovering. How’s she doing?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She’s…she’s doing alright. They’re going to wake her again this afternoon so we’ll see how that goes.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well, I’ll keep my fingers crossed for you.” She said with a caring smile. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Thanks, Summer.” Rio sighed</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Of course. I’ll be back to check on you two in a bit.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>As she and the baby were left alone once again Rio began to feel a nervous tension start to creep in. She knew it would be a while before Agatha would be well enough to go home and the idea of having him cooped up in the nursery, nameless for the time being, set her on edge. Yet there was nothing she could do but wait. Wait until she was awake. Wait until she gave him a name. Wait until they could finally go home as a family. And when would that even be? Given her condition just that morning it seemed like an eternity away. For the time being all she could do was revel in the joys of a healthy baby and hope that Agatha would come around soon. </span></p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p><span>Rio stayed as long as she could, holding the baby close, feeding him, changing him, telling him of the love both she and Agatha held for him, until at last it was time to leave. She managed to settle the sleeping child back in the incubator with little help and sneak out just in time to grab a bite to eat before heading back to Agatha. Just as she was leaving the cafeteria with a sandwich in hand her phone began to ring. She fished it out of her pocket only to find Lilia calling her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey! Lilia! I’m so sorry I’ve been meaning to call you!” She said as she answered. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Oh, not a worry at all dear, something tells me you’ve had your hands full! How is she?</span></em><span>” Lilia lilted back</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Agatha?…well, she’s alive. They have her sedated in the ICU.” Rio could hear a heavy sigh radiate through the phone. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>I was afraid of that. How are you? How’s the baby?</span></em><span>” She asked rather melancholicly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m doing alright. Just trying to hold everything together while she heals. The baby, he’s doing great actually. They’ve had him in the NICU but it looks like they might release him to the nursery tomorrow morning.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>That’s wonderful news, dear! Have you been eating? Getting any sleep?</span></em><span>” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sleep has come. I wouldn’t say it’s been restful but I’ve managed to get a few hours in. You actually caught me grabbing lunch, I just left the baby and am on my way back to see her. They’re supposed to be waking her up here again soon.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Well then I won’t keep you. Just wanted to see how you were doing since I hadn’t heard anything in a few days. My intuition was tingling.</span></em><span>” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well, per usual, your intuition was spot on. Thanks for checking in.” Rio chuckled mirthlessly.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Of course, sweetheart! Feel free to say no, but I cooked up a big pot of my stew, any chance I could bring you some for dinner?</span></em><span>” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That would be amazing, actually.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Wonderful, then I’ll plan to bring some by. Does 6:00 work?</span></em><span>” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, that sounds great.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Alright, dear. I’ll see you then.</span></em><span>”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“See you then. Love you Lilia.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“</span><em><span>Love you too sweetheart.</span></em><span>” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>As she hung up the phone she could feel a warmth fill her chest. Having been caught up in the malaise of the last few days it was comforting to hear from Lilia. She hadn’t realized how isolated she felt, despite their friends being there, but the realization that Lilia would be coming gave her a sense of solace she hadn’t realized she had been missing. And now in particular, as she walked in for what was bound to be another stress inducing ordeal, she was grateful for that support to look forward to. </span></p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p><span>As she entered Agatha’s room Dr. Stark and the nurse were already at her side and Ralph was now hovering anxiously in the corner. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hey, sorry, Lilia called me on my way back. Everything ok?” She asked him. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah, they got here like 10 minutes ago. You mind if I head out and grab some food. I don’t really wanna be here for this.” He sighed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yeah of course. I’ll let you know when they’re done.” Rio assured as she waved him out. “How’s she doing?” She asked, turning to Dr. Stark. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“So far so good. Blood pressure’s a little low but that’s common at this level of sedation, it should level out when she wakes up. We just stopped the propofol so it should be about 20 to 30 minutes. We went ahead and administered some pain medication to avoid agitation this time. The plan today is to extubate and see how she does.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Then…will she stay awake?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Possibly. It depends on her comfort level when we wake her. If she’s not handling it well we may put her back under but it would only be a fraction of where she was before.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That sounds like good news.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Her body’s responding well, the swelling has already gone down significantly and she’s had virtually no complications. It's more about pain management at this point. The more comfortable she is, the faster she’ll heal.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Naturally.” This time as they waited Rio situated herself on the edge of the bed next to Agatha, holding her hand as she brushed her fingers through her hair. She couldn’t help but notice that her color was nearly back to normal, the sunkenness of her eyes had lessened and there was a rosyness about her cheeks. She let a small piece of herself hope that maybe once she awakened she would be well enough to remain that way. Before long she felt Agatha begin to stir as her fingers closed around her hand. “I think she’s waking up.” She announced to the doctor and nurse. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Good. Ms. Harkness, can you open your eyes for me?” This time her eyes blinked open easily and quickly found Rio. “Alright, I’m Dr. Stark, do you remember me from yesterday?” She nodded as her hand reached up to try and pull at the tube. “Careful! Careful! We are going to try and remove that today but first you need to relax and breathe.” She took a struggled, gulping breath at first as she remembered how, then quickly eased into a steady rhythm. “Very good. We have your partner with us today. She and your friends have hardly left your side since you’ve been here.” He nodded towards Rio who looked lovingly down at her. A tear immediately drew to Agatha’s eye as she blinked back up at her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You’re doing so good, carino.” Rio hummed as she stroked her fingers through her hair. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Are you in any pain?” Dr. Stark asked to which Agatha nodded. “Can you show me with your fingers on a scale from 1-10, 10 being the worst?” Agatha slowly lifted her hands, drawing one away from Rio, to hold up 6 fingers. “Alright, we’re going to adjust your pain medication a bit so you should be feeling better soon.” He said as he nodded towards the nurse. They continued to monitor her as she eased further into consciousness. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>After a while Rio could feel Agatha begin to relax at her side as the medication began to take effect. About 30 minutes in, Agatha reached over to gather Rio’s attention. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes, my love? Are you still in pain?” Agatha shook her head as she attempted to mumble around the tube. “No, no, don’t try to talk, not yet.” Agatha let her eyes flutter closed as tears once again began to well in them. When she opened them again they held a sense of fear and urgency, then she brought Rio’s hand down to rest on her stomach. “The baby?” Rio asked to which Agatha nodded and cried. “He’s fine! He’s perfectly healthy.” At that Agatha began to sob further. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Please try and relax Ms. Harkness, you’re doing great, we’re nearly ready to take the tube out.” Dr. Stark urged. “How’s her blood pressure?” He asked the nurse.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Slightly elevated but steady.” she replied</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Good. I’m not going to prolong this any further. Ready the respiratory therapy.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes, doctor.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright, Ms. Harkness, this may be a little uncomfortable but it’ll be over quickly. I’ll have you take a deep breath then I’m going to need you to cough for me, ok?” Agatha nodded and took a deep breath in as Dr. Stark readied himself. “Alright, and cough.” She let out a horrendous hacking sound as he pulled the tube free then the nurse quickly stepped in and placed a breathing tube at her nose as she continued to cough for a bit. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You did so well, sweetheart.” Rio cheered as she leaned down to press a kiss to her forehead. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio…” Agatha rasped shakily.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Yes, my love?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What…what day is it? How long have I been out?” she croaked</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s Sunday afternoon. You’ve been out for almost two days.” Rio replied</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Two… two days?!” She gasped. “Where..” she started but coughed again. “Where is he? Where’s my baby?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“They sent him to the NICU when we first got here but he’s already doing so well, they’re going to transfer him out tomorrow.” Rio said, trying to ease her worry.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Please! I want to see him!” she begged through ragged breaths as tears streamed down her face. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You will, Ms. Harkness, but for now you need to rest. You’ve been through quite a lot and your body still needs some time to heal.” Dr. Stark insisted</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“When…when can I see him?” she panted</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Let’s see how you’re feeling over the next few hours. This is not something we want to rush, it could cause further harm and delay the healing process.” he warned</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I promise, as soon as I can I will bring him to you.” Rio said as she cradled Agatha’s face in her hands, urging her to look at her. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Rio…Rio what happened? I don’t remember anything after…” She trailed off as her face scrunched, searching for the memories. “I remember the festival…and Herb…and I…I was having contractions. I was going to find you but someone stopped me…I…I don’t quite remember what happened but I ran to my office and then…it’s all kind of fuzzy after that. Rio…I…I’m so sorry…I didn’t mean…this…this is all my fault!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“It’s ok, it’s alright. Don’t worry about that right now. You’re safe, you’re both ok. That’s all that matters.” Rio hummed as she pressed her forehead to Agatha’s</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Dr. Vidal.” Dr. Stark called Rio over to where he was standing near the curtain. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’ll be right back, my love.” Rio cooed as she pressed a kiss to Agatha’s cheek and hurried over. “Yes?”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Despite her being understandably upset, I’m satisfied with where she’s at. Her heart rate and blood pressure are stable so we aren’t going to sedate her any further at this time, though we may revisit that later this evening to make sure she rests through the night.” Rio let out a sigh of relief. “We’ll see how she does over the next few hours but I’m inclined to let her see the child sooner rather than later.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Seriously?” Rio gasped “That…that would be amazing.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Though I would like to keep the visit short, I think it would bring her some peace of mind and help her relax.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I completely agree!”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“In the meantime, I know you’ve had a host of visitors but she needs rest, I’d hold off on having anyone come by for the time being.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Understood.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Very good. A nurse will be in around four to see where we’re at. In the meantime I’ll try and arrange for them to bring him after.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Wonderful! Thank you doctor!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Of course.” He muttered as he exited into the ward. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Rio turned back ablaze with relief and excitement as she wandered over to Agatha.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“What did he say?” She groaned sleepily</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That you’re doing great. He’s happy with where you’re at, but you need rest so no visitors.” She explained as she snuggled in beside her on the bed.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Visitors?” Agatha grumbled</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“All your friends. We’ve been worried sick about you! Ralphs downstairs now in the cafeteria. Jen and Alice have been in and out. I talked to Lilia a little bit ago and she was going to stop by later but I’m going to have her hold off until tomorrow.” Rio babbled as she texted everyone the update. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Mmmm, but you’re staying right?” Agatha hummed as her eyes drifted closed again.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Of course, my love, I’m not going anywhere!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span> —------------------------------</span></p><p> </p><p><span>The hours passed quickly and before long a nurse was drawing back the curtain once more, waking them both from sleep. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Hello Ms. Harkness! How are we feeling?” He asked. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha blinked herself awake again as she grumbled her response. “Sore, and somehow tired.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That’s to be expected, the sedative is still working its way out of your system. You’ll likely feel groggy and a bit out of it the rest of today at the very least. How’s your pain on a scale from 1-10?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“About a four. My back actually hurts more than anything.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m not surprised. You’ve been in roughly the same position since you arrived. Though you’re not quite ready to move around just yet, we can adjust the bed so you’re a bit more comfortable.” He offered as he began to prod at her abdomen, checking the wounds. “Any change in pain?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No but that’s definitely uncomfortable.” She groaned. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Very good. Well, I’m not going to poke at you any more today. We are planning to give you another dose of pain meds in about 2 hours. Is there anything else I can get you in the meantime?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Some water? My throat is so dry!” She croaked. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Unfortunately I can’t give you any liquids just yet but I’m happy to grab you some ice chips.” He explained. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Whatever you got, I’ll take anything at this point.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You got it! I’ll be right back! Oh, Dr. Vidal, would you mind helping me for a minute?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Sure!” Rio yawned as she stretched out of the bed. “I’ll be right back, Cariño.” She said, placing a kiss on Agatha’s cheek before she shuffled out of the room behind him. </span></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><span>Agatha lay there for a moment, slowly coming to terms with everything that had happened while she waited for them to return. She was still so tired and in truth her body ached from head to toe. The room around her still didn’t feel quite real. </span><em><span>What exactly had happened? </span></em><span>She slowly peeled back the blankets and lifted up the hem of her hospital gown only to find a bandaged wound on her somewhat deflated stomach. The memories of that night were slowly coming together in pieces. She now remembered waking up in Rio’s arms. She heard vague echoes of Jen coaching her to push. Then there was the brief feeling of holding her baby on her chest, his tiny warm body squirming against her as he let out a soft cry. The mere thought of him drew tears to her eyes. She wished now more than anything she could hold him in her arms. As she wiped a few stray tears away the nurse wandered back in. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Here you go hon! Anything else I can get you?” He asked as he handed her the small cup. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“No, I should be fine. Do you know where Rio went?” She asked </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“She just stepped out for a bit. She should be back any minute.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright. Thank you.” She mumbled. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Of course! And I’m just a button push away if you need anything!” He said pointing to the call button before stepping back out. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>Agatha leaned back and slipped an ice chip into her mouth. The cool cube was soothing as it melted and trickled down her sore throat. She let her eyes flutter closed for a moment as she reveled in the sensation. As she opened her eyes to grab another piece she saw the curtains of her room begin to flutter then Rio popped her head through sporting a delighted smile.  </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Where did you run off to?” Agatha chuckled weakly. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Just down the hall and around the corner.” She shrugged. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well are you going to come back in or just hover in the doorway?” Agatha sighed </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“That depends, are you up for a visitor?” Rio asked, cheekily arching an eyebrow. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I thought the doctor said no visitors.” She frowned, unclear what Rio was getting at. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well, he did make one exception.” Rio beamed. “Close your eyes.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Haven’t they been closed enough?” Agatha scoffed. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Come on! Close them!” Rio urged</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright, alright.” Agatha agreed as she leaned back and did as she was told. She listened closely as she heard the curtain scrape and then Rio’s footsteps shuffle in and up by her side then pause. “Can I open them?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Just one second!” Rio replied and she heard her shuffle around. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“You better make it a quick second before I fall back asleep.” Agatha quipped. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Alright, you can open them.” Rio said at last. Agatha cracked an eye open in the direction of Rio’s voice then her eyes suddenly shot open. Rio stood beside her, carefully holding their swaddled son in her arms. Immediately tears of joy began to stream down her face as she reached out her arms for him. Rio inched in closer, sitting on the edge of the bed as she passed the tiny sleeping baby to Agatha. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“H…hi.” She murmured in shock as he settled quickly into the crook of her arm. “I…I can’t believe you’re here!” She gasped softly as she grazed a finger along his little plump cheek. “My sweet little bug!” She cooed as she gathered him close and pressed a kiss to his forehead, breathing in the intoxicatingly sweet scent of her child. Her heart swelled with a love so vast she thought it might explode. He was here, now, safe in her arms and she had never felt more whole. “Rio…he…he’s…”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Perfect, isn’t he?” Rio hummed as she snuggled in beside them. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“In every way!” Agatha sighed as she pulled him back to take him in more fully. “He’s really ok?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Clean bill of health! He’s quite resilient, just like his mama.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh my baby!” Agatha sighed as she felt a wave of emotion wash over her seeing his tiny fragile form. “I’m so sorry I left you!” She sniffled as the tears began to stream again. “I didn’t mean to! Mama loves you so much, little one!” She cooed as she drew him close once more and pressed her lips to his forehead. “But… I know mami took good care of you while I was gone.” She sniffled as she at last looked back at Rio. “Thank you!” She sobbed as she collapsed onto Rio’s shoulder. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Of course my love! I’m just so glad we’re all together again.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Me too.” Agatha huffed as she quelled the tears once again. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“There is just one thing still missing.” Rio smirked</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Oh? And what’s that?” Agatha asked as she dried her face with the back of her hand. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Our little bug needs a name!” Rio chuckled. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ha!” Agatha gasped out a laugh. “You’re right! I don’t think we can call him little bug forever.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Well we could but that might not go over well when he gets into school. Do you know what you want to call him?” Rio asked</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I have an idea, I just hope you’re ok with it.” Agatha admitted as she bit her lip nervously </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m sure whatever it is, it's perfect for him.” Rio assured </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I was thinking, Nicholas.”</span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Ni…Nicholas?” Rio replied in shock. “That was my brother's name.” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I know. I remember when you said it in the car. It always stuck with me, and now that I see him. It just…fits. Is that ok?” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Is it ok?!” Rio let out a laugh of astonishment. “Oh, Cariño! I didn’t think I could love you any more than I already did.” She sighed as she pressed a kiss to Agatha’s lips. “I am honored that you would name him after my brother. He would have loved being an uncle!” </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“I’m glad you approve.” Agatha beamed. “Nicholas Aloysius Harkness.” She announced as she grazed her fingers along his head. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Aloysius? Really?” Rio snickered </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“He needs a little bit of both of us.” Agatha shrugged. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Fair enough.” Rio laughed, "Oh, little Nicky, you are so loved.” She sighed as she rubbed a finger along his cheek. </span></p><p> </p><p><span>“Our perfect boy!”</span></p>
