     Summary
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      In the events leading up to Jen and Alice’s wedding, their respective best friends Agatha and Rio have to work together despite their… creative differences.
     </p>
     <p>
      Oh, and then there’s this:
      <br/>
      Rio doesn’t fall for straight women. Agatha's not a lesbian. And one of them is lying.
     </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     Notes
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      Hello! I’m usually more of a dramatic writer but the world is on fire so I’m trying my hands on something more fun. I’m borrowing Marvel’s characters and inspiration from Chappell Roan’s ‘Good luck, Babe’ to do so (like many people here have found the power in MarvelxChappell and I LOVE it).
     </p>
     <p>
      Just a heads up: I can’t write a coherent story without a little drama so there will be some angst caused by internalized homophobia, and actions/behaviors because of it. Happy ending guaranteed because - lesbians.
     </p>

    <p>
     It isn’t that Agatha wouldn’t rather spend her Saturday evening on her sofa – legs sprawled out in front of her, a glass of red in her right hand, TV remote in her left; watching some rerun of a show she’s already seen a hundred times, occasionally looking out the window to judge the neighbors for their meticulously kept lawn, because
     <em>
      how dare they,
     </em>
     and making a mental note to really, actually, no excuses this time, mow her own lawn. Next week. Maybe.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     No, that’s not it. It’s also not that she has a profound passion for commercialized unnecessary festivities like an
     <em>
      engagement party.
     </em>
     When her friend Jen had shown her the ring, Agatha had really tried to understand- she'd searched thoroughly, checked every corner of her brain to find a reason to celebrate the fact someone was
     <em>
      about to do something in the future,
     </em>
     that would ultimately
     <em>
      also
     </em>
     require a celebration… But had found none.
     <br/>
     And while she does believe that Jen and her fiancée Alice are deeply in love with each other, because they clearly are – taking every little step in their relationship as an excuse to throw a party like this is just…
     <em>
      too much
     </em>
     . It’s the first of many to come, she knows: two bachelorette parties, a rehearsal, a pre-wedding and the actual wedding are in her near future. She prays to whoever will listen that Jen and Alice aren’t planning on having a baby soon, as she can only imagine how many heinous parties will be a part of that process.
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     So, what is it then? Why is she here?
     <br/>
     <em>
      Must be friendship or something,
     </em>
     she guesses, a disgusted look on her face as she plucks a pink ‘
     <em>
      she said yes
     </em>
     !’ skewer from a donut and tosses it aside.
     <em>
      Or the open bar.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Please keep reminding me to never, never,
     <em>
      ever,
     </em>
     get married.” Right as Agatha is about to take a bite, Jen snatches the donut away from her.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Leave it! The party doesn’t start for another hour,” Jen hisses. Before she can put the donut back on the tray, Agatha grabs her by the wrist and takes a bite anyway, which causes for a (well deserved, sure
     <em>
      )
     </em>
     eye roll.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Who else is coming? Anyone I know?” Agatha inquires, mouth full of donut. Jen sighs, admitting defeat, and surrenders the baked good.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wanda and the twins are gonna be there,” she says, knowing that will piss Agatha off. Indeed it does, which she emphasizes with a very vocal
     <em>
      “ugh”
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then there’s Lilia, Monica, Mr. and Mrs. Hart, the Proctors…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen counts them on her fingers. Agatha lets out an even bigger
     <em>
      “ugh”
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     “And you remember Rio?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Double
     <em>
      ugh
     </em>
     , is that the one who can’t stop flirting with me?” Agatha asks, raking a hand through her unruly brown locks as she takes another bite. She knows, of course
     <em>
      she knows
     </em>
     who Rio is. Alice’s friend; an athletic, yet elegant lady with dark hair and tanned skin,
     <em>
      some latina in there, maybe?,
     </em>
     big brown puppy eyes, and a very frustrating sense of confidence that she uses to try and woo Agatha at every chance she gets.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The last time they had all gone out together, Agatha had been too drunk to realize Rio was just playing with her when she repeatedly gestured at her lips, as if to say Agatha had something in the corner of her mouth. Agatha had rubbed her cheek a few times, her fingers coming back clean every time, and had silently gestured for Rio to do it for her. Only when Rio had shuffled closer, closer, into her personal space, a smug look on her face, raising a hand– she noticed Jen and Alice in her peripheral vision on the other side of the booth, hands covering their mouths to not laugh out loud. It had earned Rio some physical contact alright, but not the kind she’d hoped for. A smack upside the head,
     <em>
      “oh for fuck’s sake!”,
     </em>
     a shove, “
     <em>
      stay out of my aura!”,
     </em>
     and a series of swats against her arm every time she so much as
     <em>
      thought
     </em>
     about looking in Agatha’s general direction.
     <br/>
     Oh, she knows Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re making that up,” Jen deadpans. Agatha lets her jaw drop, giving Jen an unpleasant view of whatever is left of the donut in her mouth. “Ha-ha, now please close your mouth and keep folding the napkins.” Jen gets up and turns around, completely oblivious to the bird Agatha flips her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sure thing, hon!” Agatha says in a saccharine voice, but as soon as Jen is far away enough, her smile drops and she tosses the napkins aside carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And as the evening progresses and guests start showing up, music’s playing, people chatting, children dancing, Agatha does absolutely nothing to hide the fact that she’s bored out of her skull. No one can blame her, really, when she’s forced to resort to her favorite pastime. The cheap merlot across the room will have to do.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The rest of the night could have been fairly uneventful too, if it wasn’t for Agatha tripping over a bunch of pink and silver balloons on her way to the bar.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Swearing loudly, she tries to break free from the strings, which only causes her to get even more tangled up. She swears again, and sees Wanda scowling at her from the corner of her eye. Inhaling deeply to come up with even more creative profanities, she’s interrupted by Jen who jumps in and covers her mouth with her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh for the love of–  Agatha, there are
     <em>
      children
     </em>
     here,” she says, her voice as stern as her gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, well, they have to learn at some point, don’t they?” Agatha huffs when Jen lowers her hand. Still fighting the balloon strings that are wrapped around her ankle, she casts another glance at Wanda, who is desperately trying to distract one of the twins.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’d say there’s no one better to learn that kind of language from than you,” Jen’s fiancée pipes up. She chuckles, sliding her arm around Jen’s waist. “Hi, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha presses her heel into one of the balloons and it explodes with a loud
     <em>
      BANG
     </em>
     , accidentally drawing a lot of attention to herself. She squints at Alice, who looks like she’s about to brace for impact.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You,” she says, pointing at her, “I always knew I liked you. You’re approved. One of Jen’s best characteristics seems to be her taste in
     <em>
      other people.”
      <br/>
     </em>
     She turns her pointed finger towards herself and gestures down her own body, clad in a white blouse and purple slacks. “Meaning myself, mostly.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, and I bet one of
     <em>
      your
     </em>
     best traits is being humble?” Jen sneers, which causes a third person to snicker. Agatha’s eyes whip up from her own legs to the person now standing next to Alice. She recognizes Rio, dressed in a tailored black suit and matching pumps.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What are you laughing at?” Agatha barks, sounding slightly less hostile than she wants to.
    </p>
    <p>
     ”Oh, you remember Rio, right?” Alice steps up, nodding towards her friend who is taking Agatha in with an amused smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m not sure, have we met?” Rio takes a step forward, holding out her hand for Agatha to shake. Agatha can see in her eyes she knows
     <em>
      damn well
     </em>
     they’d met. She is being an asshole and Agatha is not going to give her the satisfaction. Or maybe she is.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Eh,” Agatha shows off her best unimpressed shrug, “I’m not surprised I don’t remember someone who’d show up to an engagement party dressed in
     <em>
      all black.
     </em>
     My god, who died, dear?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Your manners, apparently,” Rio fires back, sounding equally unimpressed. Accepting the fact that Agatha isn’t gonna shake her hand, she slips it right back into her pocket, a little bit too smug for Agatha’s liking. She purses her lips, sends a pointed look in Rio’s direction, and turns to Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was just complimenting Jen on her taste in friends, but Alice, dear, don’t take it the wrong way when I say that yours is spectacularly subpar.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright!” Jen claps her hands loudly to break the tension. “I need wine.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She turns around to grab two glasses off the bar and hands one to Alice, who gratefully accepts. Rio,
     <em>
      being the insufferable show-off that she is,
     </em>
     also takes two glasses off the bar and offers one to Agatha. “M’lady?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha seeks out Jen’s gaze for a millisecond, as to say: ‘
     <em>
      see?’
     </em>
     before reaching out to accept the wine. But as her fingers graze Rio’s, a strong static shock sears through both of them. Agatha gasps and jumps back, as Rio shouts “Ouch!” and promptly drops the glass. It shatters into a million pieces, red wine spilling all over the floor and,
     <em>
      oh no,
     </em>
     Agatha’s black shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s nostrils flare as she looks down, slowly inhaling. Making eye contact with Rio again, she can feel her hands practically turning into claws. A dangerous, almost feral look on her face, she lifts her arms to launch herself at Rio. Just before she can attack her, Jen jumps in between the two of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You!” Agatha growls over Jen’s shoulder. “Look what you did! Do you have ANY idea…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Me?” Rio scoffs. “If you hadn’t declared war on some party decorations, we wouldn’t have been electrocuted.” She wiggles her fingers to get rid of the tingling feeling in them, and reaches down to pick up some of the bigger pieces of glass.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, bathroom,” Jen says to her friend, desperately wanting to defuse the situation. Agatha exhales, and turns around dramatically.
     <br/>
     “Are you gonna tell her she’ll be paying for dry cleaning?” she shouts over her shoulder as she walks away. “And get me another glass of red. Pronto.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     Agatha knows Jen's practically put her in the time-out corner, but at least she feels a little calmer when she returns after a while. She silently slips into a booth in the back of the venue, closes her eyes with a sigh, slumps down, and drops her head against the backrest. The loud music isn’t doing much for her ability to be friendly and social. Just 30 more minutes, she promises herself, then she’s allowed to go home.
    </p>
    <p>
     With her eyes still closed, she feels a slight dip in the cushion, as someone slides into the booth with her.
     <em>
      It better not be–
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Cracking one eye open, she lets out an annoyed huff at the sight of Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh please, not you. You lost the right to talk to me today,” she murmurs softly, but loud enough for Rio to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You sure? I came to make it up to you, sweetheart,” Rio says, putting two intact wine glasses down on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t call me– oh.” Agatha eyes up the generously poured peace offering in front of her, and shuffles in her seat so she sits upright again. “Well. Fine. You may stay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She picks up her glass just as Rio picks up hers. She puts it to her lips right away, ignoring Rio’s invitation to clink their glasses together.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s good to know you can be bribed,” Rio hums softly, before sipping her own drink.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s not bribing if you give me something and I give you nothing in return.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “And yet, here you are, having a conversation with me, while a moment ago I wasn’t allowed to talk to you,” Rio says, with
     <em>
      that smirk
     </em>
     on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, well, momentary lapse of judgment. I’m revoking that right again, as you can’t seem to stop being annoying,” Agatha shoots back, hoping that is going to be it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha can’t truthfully say she hates the ego boost she gains from Rio’s flattery, from being clearly found attractive– but Rio isn’t anything if not relentless, arrogant, and above all, a woman. Agatha being Jen’s best friend, she is supportive of the queer community in all the ways, it just isn’t for her. Sure, she’d kissed plenty of her female classmates back in the day, but nothing she’d want to do again.
    </p>
    <p>
     So as Agatha has nothing to win or lose from Rio, she doesn’t
     <em>
      really
     </em>
     mind keeping up their playful banter. Some might even call it flirting– but she’d been very clear about being straight, which had seemed to throw Rio off a little at the time. However both women had soon realized their banter keeps them on their toes. It’s
     <em>
      innocent
     </em>
     and it’s
     <em>
      fun
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha catches herself staring at Rio’s face, whose eyes are sparkling at the challenge. Rio raises her eyebrows, looks away, and mimes locking up her lips.
     <br/>
     She tears her eyes away from Rio’s mouth, only to land on the three opened buttons of her blouse. Realizing there had only been one unbuttoned earlier, she can’t stop herself from saying: “Wow. You sure ammo’d up.”
     <br/>
     Shaking her head, she takes another sip. Rio locks eyes with her again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Glad you noticed,” she says, straightening her shoulders, leaning one elbow on the table, chin in hand. “What can I say, I know what I want. Is it working?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snorts. “Ha! No. Still not on Team Boobs.”
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s Rio’s time to shake her head. “Yeah… you’re
     <em>
      actually
     </em>
     insane for that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Who’s insane?” Jen appears in front of the booth, followed by Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am, of course,” Agatha takes a dramatic bow, “for not showing any interest in female genitalia.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, you’re not making it
     <em>
      sound
     </em>
     very sexy,” Rio mumbles. Alice takes in the two women before clocking what is going on.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Down, boy,” she says to Rio, making an
     <em>
      ‘I’m watching you’
     </em>
     gesture. “Agatha’s not on our team.” A beat. “But I’m glad the two of you are getting along.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, yeah, basically besties,” Agatha drawls, a fake smile on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “When the two of you are done being children, I think it’s time for the speeches,” Jen says. The color drains from Agatha’s face.
     <em>
      The goddamn fucking speeches.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’ll start,” Jen explains, as she and her fiancée share a mysterious look, “and then we’ll call you on stage. Who wants to go first?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha feigns a sudden fascination for the edge of the table cloth. She can feel Rio’s eyes on her. “You’re giving a speech too?” Rio muses, and Agatha wonders if it would be too dramatic of an exit to pull the fire alarm and jump through the nearest window.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Actually…” Agatha sighs. “I would’ve
     <em>
      loved to
     </em>
     , Jen, and you know it. But I can’t possibly hold a speech with those wine stains all over my shoes.”
     <br/>
     And besides, she all but chugged that last glass of wine, so public speaking is definitely not on top of the list of smart things to do right now.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re just being a bitch right now, it’s a
     <em>
      red wine stain
     </em>
     on
     <em>
      black shoes
     </em>
     ,” Jen says. “For that, you should be going first. Barefoot if you must.” And before Agatha can protest, Jen and Alice wander off towards the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looks at Rio, ready to berate her on how she hadn’t stepped in to help, but Rio is hiding her grin behind her glass.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can’t wait to see this.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     As soon as Jen and Alice climb the small stage, the music quietens and one of the venue’s techs hands Jen a microphone. The soft murmuring of the guests dies down as she begins talking.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Welcome everybody! Dear friends, family, acquaintances… My lovely fiancée and I are honored to have you all here, celebrating our engagement.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The guests applaud as Jen gives Alice a peck on the lips, pulling her in by the waist. A few of the guests start cheering, among them Rio – which causes Agatha to dramatically cover the ear that is closest to her. Rio pouts, then whistles on her fingers, and Agatha gets distracted by a very vivid fantasy about squeezing the other woman’s windpipe until her eyes pop out.
    </p>
    <p>
     On stage, Alice takes over the mic.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I hope you’re all enjoying the food and the music, but we’d like to interrupt for just a moment. Agatha and Rio, would you please join us up here?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha prays for an interruption,
     <em>
      anything
     </em>
     will do, but nothing happens. The two women exchange a look, and now Agatha can sense Rio isn’t particularly happy about being asked on stage either.
     <em>
      Good.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Still, they scramble out of the booth, taking their wine glasses with them. The guests politely applaud once more while they walk to the front. As they approach the stage, Jen helps them up, Rio takes her place on Alice’s side, and Agatha goes to stand next to Jen, where she nervously starts picking some non-existent lint off her slacks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice holds the mic in between herself and Jen, so the both of them can speak.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So Agatha, Rio… as you know, we asked you to prepare a few words for tonight,” Alice says, looking from one to the other. Rio nervously shuffles her feet as Agatha squints into the stage lights. She hasn’t
     <em>
      forgotten,
     </em>
     she just prefers… improvising.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now, that wasn’t just to torture you,” Jen smirks. “It’s also to prepare you for the big day! Special announcement, drumroll please…  Agatha, I’d like you to be my maid of honor.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen looks at her as if she has just crowned her best friend as emperor, clearly expecting some kind of response. But Agatha’s breath hitches and she stays awkwardly silent, so Alice quickly adds: “And Rio, I’d love for you to be my best man! Eh– Woman. Person. Pick one. Or all of the above.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The guests start laughing and cheering, as Agatha and Rio find each other’s gaze. Agatha squints,
     <em>
      ‘did you know about this?’
     </em>
     but Rio seems just as surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
     The engaged couple reels their respective friend in by wrapping an arm around their shoulder, pulling them in closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This obviously means you have your work cut out for the both of you,” Jen announces into the mic.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I hate you,” Agatha says through a big fake smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “-...But Alice and I are convinced you’ll get along fine and we’re putting all of our faith in you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Does that mean we don’t
     <em>
      actually
     </em>
     have to give our speeches?” Agatha whispers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Of course it doesn’t mean you don’t
     <em>
      actually
     </em>
     have to do your speeches!” Alice repeats loudly, much to Agatha’s disdain. “Who’s first?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looks over at Rio, who is sucking in her cheek and clearly trying to avoid any eye contact. After a few excruciating seconds of silence, Agatha grabs the mic, only to avoid further humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ll take one for the team,” she snaps at Rio, taking center stage while the other women shuffle to the back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha clears her throat and shields her eyes from the harsh lighting, squinting again to oversee the whole floor. Contemplating whether she’d rather stick the microphone up the ass of the first person who looks at her funny, she at least feels a little spurred on by the alcohol in her system.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well,” she accidentally yells, voice cracking, clearing her throat once more. “Well. Hello.” She takes a breath and puts her hand on her hip. “Hi.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Great start!” she hears someone behind her whisper – must be Rio. The hairs in the back of Agatha’s neck stand up and she makes a mental note to make her windpipe fantasies come true at the first opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So eh – Jen and Alice. Alice and… Jen. That’s… these two women over here,” she stutters. “The happy couple.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The silence in the room is deafening. She turns around to the other women, and wordlessly asks if this was good enough to pass as a speech. She is met with all of them giving her a thumbs up as to say ‘
     <em>
      keep going!’.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha feels something bubbling inside her chest. This isn’t how this is gonna go,
     <em>
      public speaking
     </em>
     is
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     going to be the great Agatha Harkness’ demise. And if it is, she sure as hell will take the others with her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright, I’m assuming everybody here knows that Jen and I have been friends for a million years now. But how about I tell everybody how I met her lovely fiancée Alice over here?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, no,” a voice warns behind her, that she chooses to ignore.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jen and I used to be roommates, before these two became inseparable,” she continues. Her newfound vigor causes her to pace the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
     ”We had a few house rules, most of them initiated by Jen of course. But the one she was most adamant about, was ‘
     <em>
      absolutely no boys, Agatha',”
     </em>
     she says, mimicking Jen’s low voice. “And I, the
     <em>
      amazing friend
     </em>
     that I am, never asked her if that same rule applied to her. Because I trusted that she wouldn’t. Our holy virgin mother Mary over here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She gracefully points at Jen, who turns an interesting shade of red.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And I have to admit, even I make mistakes sometimes. Like the one time I’d just been out on a date, a really nice date, he brought me home and– well, we made out in the hallway, I guess. My bad, fair enough. But when the cool, calm, and collected Jenny Kale caught us there, she exploded like an atomic bomb. Gave the both of us a total earful, scared him away, naturally, and I was on the receiving end of a very long monologue about friendship, trust, and boundaries.
     <br/>
     Which would be fair,
     <em>
      if…”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The couple behind her holds their breath in anticipation. A high whine escapes from Alice’s throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “If not for the fact that only a few days later, I come home from work early… And what view am I being blessed with? Oh you guessed it, people! A full blast, uncensored graphic scene, performed by your leading ladies Alice and Jen, in the
     <em>
      fucking kitchen
     </em>
     nonetheless, making noises like they’re auditioning for the next pornographic feature length! What an incredible day to have eyes. And the worst part: on the counter, in its full glory, is this big, fat, rubber-…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay that’s enough!” Jen shrieks, trying to grab the mic from Agatha’s hands, who now surprisingly enough doesn’t want to give it up. Guests start murmuring again, and Agatha can just make out Wanda’s silhouette walking out with the twins.
     <em>
      Nice.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “But because I’m such a forgiving person, you have my full blessing!” Agatha all but yells in the microphone that she and Jen were now fighting over. “To the happy horny couple!” She raises her glass and finally gives up her iron grip, turns around with flair and crosses paths with Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Your turn. Eat shit,” she whispers when she
     <em>
      accidentally
     </em>
     bumps into her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Such sportsmanship,” Rio murmurs from the corner of her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha takes Rio’s place in the back and crosses her arms with a smirk – she has done pretty well, she thinks. She highly doubts Rio will display any skill or grace, talking to a room full of people like this. Oh, this is gonna be
     <em>
      good.
     </em>
     Licking her lips, she watches as Rio takes the spotlight.
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This is how Agatha learns about the consequences of making unsubstantiated assumptions. Nothing could have prepared her for the mere
     <em>
      elegance
     </em>
     , the striking
     <em>
      confidence
     </em>
     that radiates from Rio while she talks. She finds herself completely thunderstruck at Rio’s clearly well-prepared and loving speech for the couple. Clenching her teeth so as not to let her mouth hang open, she follows her every move – from the casual pacing, her laid back posture, to the eloquently chosen words… It is the most
     <em>
      stupid
     </em>
     <em>
      and impressive
     </em>
     thing Agatha has ever witnessed, and she can only see her from the back.
    </p>
    <p>
     “…and I mean it with my entire heart when I say: I’m truly honored to be your best man, Al. I’ll wear a bow tie and everything,” Rio chuckles, as she playfully tugs the collar of her blazer. Someone in the back of the room wolf whistles, which makes Rio point at them, treating them to a quick wink. Agatha feels the heat rise to her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Finally, I’d like to add…” Rio continues, holding her hand up as to excuse herself. She turns around to quickly jog towards Agatha, who breaks from her trance when her hand is grabbed and she gets pulled to the front of the stage again.
     <em>
      Here we fucking go,
     </em>
     she thinks.
    </p>
    <p>
     “…that both Agatha and I couldn’t possibly think of anyone we’d rather prepare the wedding with, than each other. This,--” she gestures between the both of them, “--is pure wedding material.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha can
     <em>
      feel
     </em>
     Rio smirk at her own double entendre. The music gets louder - a sign they should be wrapping up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Putting on her fake smile again, Agatha snarls: “I’m going to kill you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh please, and do it slowly,” Rio’s rasps, careful not to let those words reach the microphone.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If Agatha could lift her up, she would’ve hurled her off the stage.

     She would never admit it if you ask her, but Agatha does acknowledge her initial response might’ve been a little dramatic. Being her best friend’s maid of honor is a huge token of appreciation – not because of what it practically entails, but because she knows how much it means to Jen herself.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Jen, the only friend she allows to put her back in place, even if it provokes some lighthearted death threats. Jen, with a personality so completely opposite from her own, it only made sense they grew so close. Jen, who recognizes Agatha’s snarky remarks and numerous eye rolls for what they really are, and always responds accordingly; whether it is with a healthy dose of sarcasm, a bottle of wine and a tissue box, or a 30-minute long voice note (that Agatha had lovingly dubbed
     <em>
      ‘Have Mercy, Jen’s Yapping - The Podcast’)
     </em>
     with her perspective and opinion on a given situation.
     <br/>
     Jen, who had texted her Rio’s number a few days after the engagement party,
     <em>
      strongly advising her
     </em>
     to give her a call so they could start planning.
     <br/>
     Jen, who is now officially going to pay for therapy and her pacemaker.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      I’ll send you a to-do list so you know what’s expected of you,
     </em>
     Jen texts her when Agatha responds to Rio’s number with an emoji wearing a cowboy hat. She’d meant to click the clown one, but she’s sure this one conveys the message too.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      I hope you know what you’re asking,
     </em>
     she replies.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      Yes. I do.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     For the next couple of weeks Agatha does what she does best: procrastinate. It doesn’t help that the wedding isn’t gonna take place for another six months. It also doesn’t help that
     <em>
      she
     </em>
     apparently has to initiate the call, nor that she doesn’t feel particularly excited about the amount of work she has to put in. It
     <em>
      does
     </em>
     help however, when Jen starts threatening to give her address to the local Jehovah’s Witness community if she doesn’t get to work soon.
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha finally calls Rio, it’s a Sunday night and she’s in the bath. If Rio pisses her off, she’d figured, she’s already in the right place to relax. That, or she could always throw her phone in the water.
    </p>
    <p>
     Against the whole world’s expectations, the conversation doesn’t seem to go completely off the rails. It seems – civil, almost. They share their thoughts on how ridiculous it is that their friends had just dumped these duties on them, however Rio seems to be looking forward to some of them. Agatha goes through Jen’s to-do list, as Rio hums and comments on a few. It doesn’t take long for Agatha to figure out that Alice means as much to Rio, as Jen does to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     They discuss the upcoming bachelorette parties, (“
     <em>
      Why two? We could just hire one stripper and be done for the both of them?”)
     </em>
     and decide it’s easier if both women take responsibility for their own friend’s party, not mingling with the plans for the other. They would have to be present for both, of course. The pre-wedding is something neither of them knows what it entails exactly, but they agree on figuring it out later.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nearing the end of the phone call, Agatha feels a sense of relief that it hasn’t ended in national tragedy. She rubs her temple as Rio wraps up, lets out a breath she didn’t realize she was holding, and drops her arm back in the water with an audible
     <em>
      slosh.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “...so for the most part, it will just be… uh– Are– you…– Agatha, are you taking a bath?” Rio stammers distractedly. Agatha squeezes her eyes shut, realizing her mistake, and silently curses herself. She is
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     gonna give Rio any mental images to have her way with.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “None of your business.” She sits up, proud of her thoughtful and eloquent response, but it only causes more sloshing. Rio’s shy giggle completely throws her off balance.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is the idea of talking to me that exciting?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      Oh, here we fucking go,
     </em>
     Agatha thinks. “On the contrary.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Or did you start practicing for when we’re in a hot tub together?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Like I said, none of your fucking– wait, hot tub? What hot tub?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “The one at the hotel. Where… the wedding takes place,” Rio says carefully, now realizing Agatha might not be up to date.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, I am
     <em>
      so scared
     </em>
     to ask you this,” she says, pinching the bridge of her nose, the lingering in Rio’s voice not lost on her, “but… what hotel? Where? Where is the wedding?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She swears she hears Rio gulp before hearing her squeak: “Mexico?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Which is, not coincidentally, the exact word Agatha screeches when she barges into Jen’s skin care boutique the next day. Jen barely acknowledges her and very calmly screws the lid on a bottle, only using index finger and thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You spoke to Rio, then?” She rests her elbows on the table and looks up at her friend who, in that moment, looks comically similar to Hades from the animated movie Hercules.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You forgot to tell me the wedding I’m supposed to plan is going to be in
     <em>
      fucking
     </em>
     Mexico? Or did you think that’s just a minor detail?
     <em>
      Or,
     </em>
     were you going to
     <em>
      publicly announce
     </em>
     it again, like-”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We decided last week. But, Agatha– what’s up with all this anger? I thought it’d be nice for you to have an excuse to take a few days off, chill out at the beach, bask in the sun-”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Some of us have
     <em>
      a job
     </em>
     -”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You run your own practice, Agatha-”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “And how am I supposed to plan everything when I don’t know-”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You don’t have to do this alone, remember?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “And maybe that’s the issue, on top of everything you’re making me do this with
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     -”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio speaks Spanish-”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And why did
     <em>
      she
     </em>
     know and I didn’t?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ah, there it is,” Jen nods. “So
     <em>
      that’s
     </em>
     the real issue?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha crosses her arms and exhales like a riled up bull. “I just– I don’t like surprises.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Jen stands up and walks to the little coffee counter in the corner of the boutique, placing two cups under the machine and pressing a button. “It wasn’t meant to be a surprise, Agatha,” she says over the loud noise of the coffee machine. “I told you– we decided last week, and Alice simply got to talk to Rio before I got to talk to you. That’s it.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha looks at her incredulously, but thaws out when Jen hands her a steaming cup. “I’d like for you to keep me in the loop next time,” she murmurs to her coffee.
     <br/>
     She hates this feeling– when other people know something she doesn’t. And to go through that kind of embarrassment while Rio is on the other side of the phone is not something she wants to experience again. It makes her feel… stupid. Out of control. Powerless.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She sips her coffee and makes a face. “I keep forgetting the chemical waste you serve your clients as a sorry excuse for–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Agatha, listen,” Jen sighs, leaning back against the counter, “because we’re only having this conversation once.” She lifts a finger for emphasis.
     <br/>
     “I meant every word when I said I’d love for you to be my maid of honor, and I was convinced that would be something you’re interested in too. You’ve been nagging me about my future wedding long before I met Alice. But if you’re not up for it, for whatever reason… This is the emergency exit. You don’t have to do it, just tell me now and I’ll pick someone else, no questions asked.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Pressing her lips together, Agatha eyes up her friend. She realizes what Jen is doing– she can feel her unspoken apology for putting her on the spot at the engagement party. For dropping such a big responsibility on her without consultation. And now she’s giving her an out, which Agatha greatly appreciates and considers; but in all Jen’s vulnerability she also recognizes a silent plea, because this is something she’s dreamt of sharing together.
    </p>
    <p>
     So, after a long moment of silence, Agatha says: “you better
     <em>
      motherfucking
     </em>
     brace yourself for your bachelorette party.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And Jen beams.
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But, after a few days of brooding, Agatha curses her own big mouth. She has no idea what she should plan for Jen’s big night out. The numerous ‘
     <em>

      surprise!’
     </em>
     , she isn’t sure if she wants to cry or vomit.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a couple of weeks, she tries to ignore the voice in her head saying there’s someone she could call and discuss this with; someone who happens to be in a very similar situation. She’s convinced that if her phone had free will, it would open on Rio’s contact page every time she unlocks the screen. Which is why she
     <em>
      doesn’t
     </em>
     call her, because she’s a grown ass woman who is able to come up with something simple and mundane and fun,
     <em>
      she’s fun, right?,
     </em>
     and she doesn’t need anybody else, most certainly not Rio–
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She calls Rio.
     <br/>
     And after surviving the initial bath-themed innuendos, they agree to meet up at a coffee shop in town the next day. When Agatha spends a little longer than usual picking her outfit for the day, settling on a lavender silk blouse, she convinces herself it’s the most comfortable item in her closet.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha arrives, Rio is already there. She’s wearing a tweed jacket, one earbud in, typing away on a laptop in front of her. When she notices Agatha, her face lights up and she plucks the earbud out. “Hey! How are you?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha forces one corner of her mouth up. “Hey. You didn’t order yet?” she asks, motioning at the otherwise empty table. Rio shakes her head.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No, I was gonna wait for you. What’ll you have? Sit, and I’ll get it,” she says while getting up, and Agatha decides she doesn’t like how chipper she sounds.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No, I’ll get it,” she hears herself say, not entirely sure why. It’s definitely not about control, she’s just–
     <em>
      attentive
     </em>
     like that. Rio is here because Agatha needed her help anyway.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh, okay,” Rio nods slowly, taking Agatha’s conflicted expression in. “That’s– very kind of you, Agatha.” Agatha chooses to ignore the drop in her voice when she says her name.
     <br/>
     As Rio slides back into her seat, Agatha unwraps her scarf, both of them remaining eye contact.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So? What will it be?” Agatha says impatiently, leaning her hands on the back of her chair. “I’m capable of many things, mind reading is not one of them.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She expects Rio to name some teeth shattering sugary drink, but is met with, “just a double espresso, please.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And she doesn’t know
     <em>
      why
     </em>
     that pisses her off too, but at least she hides it well as she walks up the counter and orders Rio’s espresso and a black coffee for herself.
     <br/>
     It has
     <em>
      nothing
     </em>
     to do with the unexpected sense of delicacy that she couldn’t quite match with Rio’s personality, and probably
     <em>
      everything
     </em>
     with Rio being a pretentious snob to impress her. So when she eventually watches Rio sip her drink and swipe her bottom lip with her tongue, it calms her down to imagine Rio secretly
     <em>
      hates
     </em>
     it and is currently
     <em>
      suffering
     </em>
     .
     <br/>
     Now she just has to find an undetected moment to drop a sugar cube in her own coffee.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So, let’s brainstorm,” Rio says, leaning back in her chair. “Did you pick a date for Jen’s party?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha shakes her head, “you?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Mm.” Rio unlocks her laptop screen with her fingerprint and pulls up her calendar. “So the wedding is in May, and I wanted to plan Alice’s as close to the wedding as possible, but– I can’t do that because I have a work thing. And I’m sure everyone needs to save up for the trip a little, so I was thinking– mid February?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha takes her in with crossed arms, and forgets to respond. Rio’s lifted eyebrow promptly startles her into action and she shifts in her seat, nodding. “Yeah. Yeah, sounds good.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “And maybe you can do Jen’s before that? Sometime after the holidays?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Sure,” she agrees, slurping her coffee. Despite herself, she finds it comforting Rio’s taking initiative, steering the conversation.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I just– I have
     <em>
      no idea
     </em>
     how these things work, Rio,” she admits. “I don’t have a fucking clue what to do.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Well, that’s why we’re here, right?” Rio gives her a quick wink, and the calm she was beginning to feel dissipates immediately.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Do
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     have a plan?” she fires back; like a shield before the wink can reach her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Actually, I do. I have this really fun idea for a workshop in mind–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “A workshop?” Agatha cackles. “What, like cooking? Or painting?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A mischievous glint appears in Rio’s eyes. “Yeah… Something like that.” She raises her eyebrows innocently and takes another sip of her espresso.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Whatever, it’s your party. Literally.” Agatha dismisses it with a wave of her hand. She stares out the window for a few seconds before realizing that, if she’s here for Rio’s help, she could
     <em>
      maybe
     </em>
     do with a little bit more friendliness.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m sure it’ll be fun.” She looks back at Rio, trying hard to sound genuine. “Any ideas for Jen?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You already mentioned a stripper, why not do that?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha scoffs. “That sounds so– tacky.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Not if you do it right,” Rio leans in and lowers her voice. “There’s a very fancy place downtown. It’s on the upper floor of one of the skyscrapers there– they don’t do any advertising. It’s the kind of place with a whole ass employed person inside the elevator, pushing the buttons for you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha purses her lips and looks down when she sighs: “Well, I certainly don’t need to pay someone to push my buttons. You seem to be perfectly happy executing that job
     <em>
      for free
     </em>
     .”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio doesn’t respond, and Agatha lifts her eyes back up, stealing a look from under her lashes. They stare at each other during a few seconds of awkward silence, and then–
     <br/>
     The both of them lose their composure, full-on belly laughing at the same time.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Something frees up in Agatha’s chest, it feels like someone has put her on oxygen after having been in a very tight space for a long time. The tension in her stomach lessens, and she feels herself relax for the first time. Catching Rio off guard definitely helps too– seeing her wall of coolness break to make space for genuine laughter.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You know what, fair point I guess,” Rio shrugs, a smirk still on her face. “But I’m serious, this place is– it’s classy. The girls are so talented, they’re treated well, and they have an excellent bar.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Sure,” Agatha muses, “you’d go there because you like
     <em>
      the bar.”
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “That’s not what I’m saying,” Rio replies, a faint blush creeping up from the collar of her jacket, all the way to her cheeks. “Just trust me, it’s a good option. Even if the both of them are there; going to a strip club as a couple usually really sparks up the–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What do you mean? Jen and Alice are going to be there for each other’s bachelorette party? So why are we planning
     <em>
      two?!”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, yeah, I mean– have you met them? Of course they each want their own day.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Mm. Now you make a fair point.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They sit in silence for a moment, but it’s a comfortable one this time.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So what’s your work thing?” Agatha asks, curiosity getting the better of her. When Rio gives her a confused look, she adds: “You said you have a work thing, before the wedding. What do you do for work?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m– a psychologist,” Rio replies, uncharacteristically shy.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “And… you have a lot of clients in the spring?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A dry chuckle. “I’m a psychologist, Agatha. Not a therapist. A therapist works with clients and I– I just do a lot of research. I’m going on a business trip to Switzerland in March.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Ah. A scientist." Agatha nods her head at the tweed jacket.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Of the brain, yes.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So what are you currently working on?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Do you really want to know?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I wouldn’t ask if I didn’t.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio straightens her back. “It’s not a… cheerful topic, to be honest.” When Agatha keeps looking at her, she continues, “I’m working on a scientific paper about euthanasia– researching the effects on both the patient and their relatives. I’m trying to defend the morality of it, hoping it’ll become legal everywhere. There’s a lot of people who don’t find it ethical, saying we shouldn’t be playing God or whatever. I think
     <em>
      preventing
     </em>
     the option of assisted suicide is playing God and
     <em>
      they
     </em>
     are the immoral ones.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Something dark has cast over Rio’s face, but there’s definitely a sense of passion in her words. Agatha is taken aback by this piece of information– there’s no way she would’ve thought that Rio,
     <em>
      happy, playful Rio,
     </em>
     had such a… heavy job.
     <br/>
     It doesn’t happen often, but– “Rio, I don’t know what to say. I mean– I agree, completely, but– wow.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio chuckles, but the smile doesn’t reach her eyes. “What about you? What do you do?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I, uh–,” Agatha nervously starts rolling up her sleeves, “I’m a life coach. I have my own practice,” she says, like it’s something she should apologize for. It feels silly, compared to Rio’s project. When she looks up, there’s a glimmer in Rio’s eyes, and something– a hint of something she can’t quite place.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Poetic, isn’t it?” Rio remarks. Agatha gives her a confused look and she continues,
     <br/>
     “You guide people through life… I guide them through death.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughs breathlessly. It
     <em>
      does
     </em>
     sound poetic, but something about it makes her feel uneasy. She keeps imagining Rio, who is
     <em>
      so full of life
     </em>
     , navigating such dark waters. She imagines her alone, behind a desk, in a lab, or talking to terminally ill people, people who mentally struggle, trying to give them a humane way out– and it feels
     <em>
      heavy
     </em>
     . It tugs on her heart.
     <br/>
     “Hey,” Rio says, stretching her arm out on the table, some kind of invitation. “Where did you go?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha shakes her head, physically trying to get rid of the images in her head. “Nowhere. You… you do incredible work.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio gives her a lopsided smile and nods.
     <em>
      I understand, let’s move on.
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’ll text you the address. Just think about it. And if you happen to go for it and everybody ends up
     <em>
      loving
     </em>
     it– it was all your idea, 'kay?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha nods, absentmindedly tracing a finger over the rim of her cup. Rio closes her laptop, and stands up to slip on her black trenchcoat. She buttons it up; “Thank you for the coffee,” and leans forward, reaching out to briefly touch the collar of Agatha’s blouse.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “This is a really nice color on you, by the way,” she says softly, before turning back to put her laptop in her bag. Agatha’s inner fire lights up, not sure if she’s flattered or angry or
     <em>
      about to commit a crime,
     </em>
     but probably all three.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Let me know what you decide, yeah?” Rio says.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’ll think about it,” Agatha replies.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When she gets home, Agatha does, in fact, think about it. For a whole three seconds she contemplates coming up with a different plan, but she knows Rio’s plan is perfect.

     After Agatha finalizes her plan, she sends the invitations with the time and place to the list of names Jen has given her. Everybody’s in on where they will be going, except for the brides-to-be.
     <br/>
     Christmas comes and goes, and Agatha doesn’t think about the party or the wedding much. Rio occasionally sends her pictures of wedding decorations that she finds online or in real life; Agatha responds to all of them with the thumb emoji.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      Just so you know, I’m interpreting that as ‘yes, buy it’,
     </em>
     Rio texts her after the fourth or fifth one.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      You’ll be the one making space for it in your suitcase then,
     </em>
     she texts back.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio sends her a thumb emoji. Agatha snorts.
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As January rolls around, Agatha soon finds herself in an elevator with Jen, Alice, and some guy who gets paid to push the floor button for them.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      ETA; 30 secs,
     </em>
     she texts Rio, signaling the people upstairs to get ready.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The giggling couple beside her is holding hands, exchanging nervous glances. They look absolutely stunning– Agatha had given them the instruction to ‘
     <em>
      dress like you’ll catch on fire if you try to enter a church’.
     </em>
     They had clearly understood and taken it to heart.
     <br/>
     Alice is wearing a tight leather jumpsuit, with lots of metal details in the right places. Jen wears a pink two-piece: a top that’s really nothing more than a band around her chest, and a matching skirt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha herself is wearing a sleek black cocktail dress that almost could’ve been called modest, if not for the criminally low cut in the front, ending just an inch above her belly button. As she grins at herself in the mirror, she straightens her shoulders. Oh,
     <em>
      she looks fine.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The elevator
     <em>
      dings
     </em>
     and the doors slide open; elevator guy motions for them to go ahead. They take a few steps before they catch sight of the group of —mostly Jen’s— friends, excitedly waiting for them, jumping and cheering.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Hi guys!” Alice squeals, as Jen starts greeting her friends by wrapping them in a tight hug one by one. Some of them, Agatha has seen before; like Lilia and Monica. Some of the others she’s only ever spoken to via text. Apparently, that’s not an issue when Jen’s friends start hugging her too, exchanging names and complimenting her outfit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha continues down the group of giddy women, forcing herself to make small talk like her life depends on it, and opens up her arms to hug the next one in line when she realizes she’s face to face with Rio.
     <em>
      Oh. Right.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     “Oh, we’re hugging?” Rio says, sounding pleasantly surprised. “Hi, sweetheart.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Before Agatha can retract, Rio pulls her in by wrapping one arm around her shoulders. She feels a set of cool lips on her cheek, the strong scent of a warm, earthly perfume enters her nose– and when she blinks, it’s already over. Rio takes a step back to admire Agatha’s outfit.
     <br/>
     She’s taller than Agatha remembers, having at least a couple inches on her now; she must be wearing even higher heels than last time. Agatha drops her gaze to confirm, and is surprised to see a pair of high laced boots. Letting her eyes drift up further, she takes in the tight leather pants,
     <em>
      too tight,
     </em>
     hugging Rio’s hips so well she can almost see the details of her skin through the fabric. The showstopper of it all is the blazer; simple black cotton, except for the collar and the sleeves, which are made out of leather too. It’s held together by a single metal chain in the center instead of a button, pulling on both sides of the blazer. And underneath it– nothing.
     <em>
      She’s wearing nothing underneath.
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Her eyes flick up to meet Rio’s gaze, but Rio seems to have completely lost track somewhere around Agatha’s sternum. It gives her the opportunity to take in her face too: she’s wearing a natural make-up look, but her eyes are framed by smokey eyeshadow. Her hair is pulled back in a sleek bun, which looks surprisingly feminine on her, complementing the androgynous outfit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha bites the inside of her cheek when she realizes how many details about the other woman stand out to her– which
     <em>
      actually
     </em>
     completely makes sense, as they’re both here as party planners. Right? It’s perfectly normal to check her out like this, to assess whether they look like they’re on the same page; whether they team up well.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha thinks fast, well aware she’s one step ahead of the other woman for as long as she is still distracted by her chest.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Hey, hello,” Agatha says, snapping her fingers in front of Rio’s face. “Eyes up here, please.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The spell Rio is under shatters, and she cocks an eyebrow. “You’re one to talk!” she says defensively, before Agatha’s eyes flicker to the swell of Rio’s breasts and back up again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah…” she drawls, pointing a finger at the other woman, “but
     <em>
      you’re
     </em>
     just indecent.” Her finger keeps moving forward until it eventually lands square in Rio’s chest, a couple of inches above the metal chain. She feels her breath hitch under her touch, and smirks. Knowing perfectly well the same could be said for her own outfit– she finds one upping Rio exhilarating.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not giving her any chance to reply, she swiftly turns to Jen.
     <br/>
     “So, Ms. Bride, any idea where we are?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen takes in the area, an impressed look on her face, when her eyes land on a big round stage in the middle of the floor. It’s covered in mirrors and there’s a pole in the center of it. Some other unknown equipment hangs from the ceiling; the rest of the bar area is covered in soft velvet furniture, two seats per table, all facing the stage. The whole place is intimately lit by small homey looking lamps on top of the side tables.
     <br/>
     Light jazz music plays over the speakers, just drowning out the soft murmur of the guests who are already seated.
     <br/>
     Jen lets out a breathless laugh when one of the servers, in nothing more than a stylish bikini, approaches her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Damn, Agatha,” she says as she lets the server take her hand, “this place is
     <em>
      fucking classy as shit!”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     The women around her chuckle at Jen’s exclamation. “How did you even find this?” she asks, not really waiting for an answer. She grabs Alice by the wrist and the server guides the both of them towards one of the tables.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha turns her head and is met with Rio’s (somewhat murderous) gaze.
     <em>
      Whoops.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     She silently mouths ‘
     <em>
      thank you’,
     </em>
     and the taller woman’s face softens. She nods her head, once, almost invisibly so.
     <em>
      A mutual understanding.
     </em>
     But Agatha isn’t anything if not observant, and she doesn’t miss the proud smile Rio is desperately trying to hide.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It shouldn’t really surprise her that, once everybody is seated, Agatha gets paired up to share a table with Rio. Fair enough.
     <br/>
     She catches Jen’s impressed smile; she and Alice sit across from them on the other side of the stage. Jen waves and gives her a thumbs up.
     <br/>
     Agatha finds herself in a surprisingly good mood, satisfied with the way everything is going smoothly so far. She even surprises Rio by not snapping at her like a rabid dog when Rio moves closer to show her the drinks menu.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “The signature margaritas sound amazing, what do you think?” Rio says, gliding her index finger over the menu.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      Absolutely
     </em>
     not,” is Agatha’s immediate response. “Tequila makes me take my clothes off. I’d rather–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio snaps the menu shut. “Two margaritas please,” she tells their scantily clad server, who nods and walks away.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha sighs, because apparently she’s left her spine in the fucking elevator.
     <br/>
     “You think you’ll win the game like this, dear, but ultimately you’re only making things harder for yourself.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Please,” Rio scoffs, looking straight ahead, a faint smirk on her face. “I’m not doing it for
     <em>
      me
     </em>
     . I was hoping by the end of the night you’d find yourself on stage, making some extra money.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, you’d like that, wouldn’t you?” Agatha narrows her eyes at her, but Rio refuses to look make eye contact. Instead, her smirk widens, and her tongue pokes the inside of her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You bet.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha feels a knot in her stomach and she wonders what it means– she settles on a really strong desire to punch the other woman in the jaw. Anything that’ll wipe
     <em>
      that smirk off her face.
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As soon as their drinks arrive, a door in the back of the room opens and the first dancer walks towards the stage. Even Agatha can’t deny she looks gorgeous; she wears a silver bodysuit that puts her full thighs and dark skin on display beautifully. Her face radiates as she climbs on stage and looks around, trying to eye up every single guest individually. She looks incredibly graceful as she climbs the pole, getting into her starting position. A deep, female voice makes an announcement over the speakers: “
     <em>
      Please give it up for… Zaza!”
     </em>
     and the guests start to whistle and cheer. A spotlight turns on and
     <em>
      Take me to church
     </em>
     starts playing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha, who had been prepared to make some witty remarks about the woman on stage, is completely blown away by the talent Zaza displays; showing off her flexibility and acrobatic skills in and around the pole. She sinks down in the full splits multiple times and it doesn’t take long before people walk up to the edge of the stage, waving cash in hand. Agatha watches her slack-jawed as Zaza approaches each one of them, and points to where in her bodysuit she wants them to slide the money.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “She’s so… athletic,” Agatha whispers in awe.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio nods, her eyes glued to the stage. “Right?” she agrees. “These women aren’t just strippers… they’re athletes. Artists.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Before Agatha registers what’s happening, Rio reaches for her purse, fishes out a ten-dollar bill and walks up to the stage. Zaza, who’s on her back on the floor now, smoothly rolls over to Rio and pulls on the fabric of the bodysuit near her thigh so Rio can slide the money in. She winks, blows her a kiss, and slides back, elegantly lifting herself back up in the pole.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When Rio returns to her seat, she’s all giggles.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Enjoying yourself?” Agatha muses, licking a bit of salt off the rim of her margarita before taking a sip.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You have no idea.” Rio lands back in her seat with a chuckle, grabbing her drink too, copying Agatha’s movements.
     <br/>
     When Agatha registers how flustered Rio is, the knot in her stomach is back– and it tightens. She feels something winding up inside of her, a strange kind of energy that starts in her center but very quickly spreads throughout her whole body. It vibrates, it’s alive, it makes her
     <em>
      feel
     </em>
     alive, and she
     <em>
      needs
     </em>
     to stop it before it makes her want to do something bold. Tearing her eyes away from Rio, she decides that taking another large sip from her drink is probably the best course of action here.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The song finishes and the crowd goes wild: people are cheering, standing up, and even more people throw their cash on stage. Agatha wonders how Zaza is going to collect all of those bills– and is surprised when she doesn’t. Instead, she takes a final bow and walks off. One of the bartenders, who is one of the more decently clad workers here in a tank top and shorts, hauls himself on stage and quickly gathers the money with a broom.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Don’t worry, she gets all of it,” Rio answers Agatha’s unasked question. “It protects their dignity, when they don’t have to collect it all themselves.”
    </p>
    <p>
     More acts follow, one of the most intriguing ones being a woman climbing two pieces of silk that hang from the ceiling. Some others just dance, occasionally
     <em>
      actually
     </em>
     stripping, and there’s a mesmerizing performance by a woman in a large suspended hoop.
     <br/>
     Agatha feels a strong sense of pride when she sees Jen absolutely having the time of her life, totally blown away by the dancers and stealing looks and kisses from Alice in between. When Jen’s eyes catch Agatha’s, she blows her a grateful kiss across the room– and Agatha rolls her eyes, but blows one back.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And yet, Agatha’s second nor her third margarita do anything to stop the coiled energy in her body from building up. Her cheeks feel hot and it doesn’t help that the energy in the room changes too; with every dancer, their acts get sexier, more clothes come off, and both dancers and guests get bolder.
     <br/>
     When the next act finishes, Agatha finds herself whistling on her fingers– and she sees Rio’s mouth fall open from the corner of her eye.
     <em>
      Oh, she’s on a roll now
     </em>
     . Encouraged by Rio’s eyes still on her, she picks up her glass and takes a long, explicit, filthy lick of salt before downing the rest of the liquid. She keeps her eyes on the stage, but she knows that if she were to look to her side now, she’d find the other woman crumbling down completely.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The next act is being announced,
     <em>
      “Prepare yourselves for… Nuria!”
     </em>
     and once again, the energy shifts. The lights dim, making it feel even more intimate, and as the next gorgeous woman takes her place on stage, the low bass of
     <em>
      Glory Box
     </em>
     fills the room. Nuria is tall, muscly, wears nothing more than shorts and a bikini top, and is right from the start clearly not shy about making intimate eye contact with the people closest to the stage. She happens to fall on her knees in front of Alice, making a show of sliding her hand down her shorts. Alice moves her arms like she’s worshiping her, and slides a bill onto the stage before returning to her fiancée’s lap.
     <br/>
     Nuria whistles however, and Alice looks over her shoulder. The dancer turns her back towards Alice, and points at the string of her bikini top. All women from Jen’s friend group, Rio and Agatha included, scream when Alice pulls the string and the top comes off.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Straight women are so fucking weird,” Rio sighs, seemingly out of nowhere.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha almost pulls a muscle turning her neck. “What do you mean?” There’s that faint tug in her stomach again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “There is
     <em>
      no way
     </em>
     this doesn’t turn
     <em>
      everybody
     </em>
     on,” Rio says incredulously.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha wants to respond, but a lump in her throat prevents her from doing so. She swallows, and tries to find new words.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I mean, they’re all beautiful women,” she says, her tone almost business-like. “Sure. And they’re so talented; there’s no way I could ever do what they’re doing–”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh come on!” Rio exclaims, a bit too loudly, “‘
     <em>
      They’re all beautiful women’?
     </em>
     They’re fucking
     <em>
      hot,
     </em>
     Agatha, they’re sexy
     <em>
      as fuck!”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughs when she sees the color of Rio’s cheeks matches the feeling of her own. “Careful dear, you’re drooling,” she says, and reaches out to tap the underside of Rio’s chin. But before she gets there, a shadow casts over her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She looks up, and Nuria is right in front of her, topless and smirking.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh no.
     <em>
      Oh no-
     </em>
     ” Agatha buries her face in her hands as the stripper straddles her, grinding her hips to the rhythm of the music. “Damn, buy a girl dinner first–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Next to her, Rio squeals so loudly she’s convinced she just burst an eardrum.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Nuria reaches for Agatha’s wrists, pulling them away from her face, and she slowly brings them up to her own naked breasts. Agatha squirms in her seat, somewhere between giggling and wanting to combust on the spot, pulling her arms back before reaching her chest. Nuria is stronger however.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Pick her,
     <em>
      pick her!”
     </em>
     Agatha screeches as a last resort, whipping her head towards Rio. “She wants it!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Nuria looks over to Rio who, to Agatha’s surprise, nods enthusiastically. The stripper shrugs,
     <em>
      your loss,
     </em>
     and moves over to Rio. Instead of straddling her, she walks backwards to the stage, crooking a finger to beckon her. Rio smiles wickedly before pushing herself out of her seat and following the woman on stage. She’s welcomed by everyone in the room cheering her on; Jen and Alice practically throw themselves towards the stage to miss nothing of what’s about to happen.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The sultry melody of the song continues as Nuria places her hands on Rio’s hips, and their bodies start moving in sync. Every step, every beat, every cheer eggs them on, encouraging them to make their moves even dirtier. Nuria turns around in Rio’s arms, her back pressed to the other woman’s front now, and she reaches behind her to take Rio’s wrists. There’s a lustful look in Rio’s eyes as her hands are brought around the stripper’s body, and they land on her breasts.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha suddenly feels like she’s in a chokehold– but when she claws away at her throat, there’s nothing there. She tears her eyes away from Rio, and sees the other women jumping up and down, going completely out of their minds. There’s a sudden sharp pain in the palm of Agatha’s hand; when she looks down, she notices indents from her own nails digging into the flesh.
     <br/>
     When she looks up, she sees Nuria turning back around again, leaning in to whisper something in Rio’s ear. Her expression changes, from lustful to surprised, to absolutely evil.
     <br/>
     Whatever it is Nuria has just asked her– Agatha is sure it means trouble. The thing inside her knows it too, because it starts buzzing through her like she’s overloaded with electricity. She glances to the side to see if there’s some alcohol in her glass left, but it’s empty. She slumps down in her chair and takes a deep breath, preparing herself for what’s coming.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     On stage, Nuria’s fingers are fumbling with the metal chain that holds Rio’s blazer together. When Agatha clocks what’s going on, it’s already too late to look away. Nuria falls down on her knees to give all the attention and praise to Rio as her blazer slowly,
     <em>
      slowly
     </em>
     comes off. The yelling of the people around her now drown out the music, people go feral in support of her. Agatha isn’t sure she’s still breathing as Rio turns her head and looks at
     <em>
      her,
     </em>
     that evil smile still on her face. Covering her front with the blazer still in hand, she walks in Agatha’s direction, to the edge of the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha can’t recall when she started losing this battle, but she’s definitely,
     <em>
      definitely
     </em>
     the loser here. Every little bit of ego, composure, control she once had– it’s gone. It had slipped away to make space for the thing that’s setting her veins on fire, sizzling through her head, taking away her breath and squeezing her stomach. But
     <em>
      no,
     </em>
     apparently that’s not enough for Rio– she has to kick her while she’s down.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Looking up at her, Rio biting her lip is the last thing she sees before Agatha’s vision is suddenly blocked by the blazer that’s being thrown her way. Not only does she get smacked in the face by the fabric, but also by a wave of the earthly perfume that clings to it, and it snuffs out all other senses. Agatha thinks she’s about to pass out when she takes the fabric in her fists, gripping onto it like it’s her lifeline, and pulls it from her face to be able to breathe–
     <br/>
     Big mistake.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio’s still on stage, graciously receiving the standing ovation the room is giving her, while her own hands cover her nipples.
     <em>
      How proper of her,
     </em>
     Agatha’s hisses in her mind. She wants to give up, she wants to tap out, she wants to wave a white flag. Instead, she covers her head again with the blazer.
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     She doesn’t know how much time has passed when she feels a tap on her shoulder.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No,” she says, the sound muffled.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Agatha, please, I’m half naked,” Rio says.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha pushes the blazer off of herself with lightning speed. “Oh,
     <em>
      are you?”
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio takes the jacket from her and calmly slips it back on. As the next dancer prepares herself on stage, she leans in and quips: “So what was it you said about making things harder for myself?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The complete mess of a woman that Agatha now is, sneers: “Did you have fun over there?” and Rio has the
     <em>
      goddamn fucking nerve to shrug
     </em>
     and replies: “Yeah. She’s not really my type though.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha shuffles to sit up in her chair, not breaking eye contact with Rio, who still stands in front of her. Whether it’s the alcohol, the dancing, the atmosphere, Rio herself, or the goddamn thing in her goddamn chest, she doesn’t know, but something makes her take the bait. Walking right into the trap, eyes wide open.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh yeah? So what
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     your type?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The next couple of seconds are excruciating. Neither woman says anything, both breathing heavily. When she realizes Rio isn’t gonna answer her, Agatha slowly,
     <em>
      slowly
     </em>
     gets up, until eventually,
     <em>
      because Rio is too stubborn to move,
     </em>
     their noses almost touch.
     <br/>
     Being this close, Agatha can see the storm that brews in Rio’s eyes– a storm that matches the hurricane that courses through her own body. And that connection makes her cave. She knows what she has to do.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     For just a fraction of a second, Agatha’s eyes flick down to Rio’s lips, and back up again. It’s subtle, almost
     <em>
      too
     </em>
     subtle, but she knows it’s enough. They keep staring at each other for a just moment longer, before Agatha turns around and walks away.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And when she pushes open the bathroom door, she doesn’t need to turn around to know Rio is following close behind her. Agatha calmly turns around and leans back, arms crossed, the cool porcelain of the sink pressing in her back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looks at her with a dark, piercing look in her eyes, almost predatory. Her lips are slightly parted, and that all too familiar
     <em>
      smirk
     </em>
     is plastered to her face. With a 5 foot gap between them that slowly closes as Rio stalks towards her, Agatha can’t help but feel like her prey, except for the fact that she willingly cornered herself. She tilts her chin up in defiance– even if she’s about to be devoured, she needs to be in control.
     <br/>
     But what she soon realizes is that Rio
     <em>
      gives
     </em>
     it to her, coming to a halt right in front of her. She just takes her in, and suddenly Agatha knows exactly what to do to finally wipe that smirk off her face. She drops her arms and places her hands on the sink behind her, cocking her head to the side.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What would you do if I kissed you right now?” she dares, her voice hoarse but confident. Indeed– Rio’s smile falters, even if only for just a moment, and she lets out a breathless laugh.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “If you kissed me right now… I might be about to give you the best make-out session of your
     <em>
      life.”
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The knot in Agatha’s stomach gets pulled so tightly, it feels like a punch to the gut. She knows the energy that’s been building up inside of her can’t be contained much longer, so she reaches out to Rio’s arm, and yanks her closer. Rio’s hands land on her hips, their lips meet–
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The beast inside her
     <em>
      roars.
     </em>
     Her own hands wrap around Rio’s waist as they finally give in to the kiss. With Rio slightly towering over her, she’s pushed back into the sink as their bodies collide in an undeniable need to be even
     <em>
      closer.
     </em>
     It’s slow, but it’s intense; both women desperately breathe each other in, pushing their lips together like they are each other’s lifeline.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha feels one of Rio’s hands slowly tickling up her body, the touch of her fingers light and yet driving her absolutely crazy. When they reach Agatha’s neck, she softly scratches at the base of her skull, sending goosebumps all over her body. Rio’s tongue swipes over her top lip, asking for permission to enter, and Agatha opens her mouth.
     <br/>
     The
     <em>
      groan
     </em>
     that leaves her throat when she feels the other woman’s tongue consume her– she’s sure that she’s never,
     <em>
      ever
     </em>
     made that sound before because of a
     <em>
      just a kiss–
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     It’s like Rio is trying to taste every part of her mouth; and Agatha lets her. In response, her own hands slide lower until they find rest on Rio’s leather-clad ass, and she pulls their bodies taut. Rio lets out a soft moan that vibrates against her skin, and Agatha revels in the sound.
     <br/>
     Their kiss deepens, and Agatha decides she wants to do whatever it takes to hear her make that sound again. However, she’s caught off guard by the hand that was still on her hips now finding its way to her hair, finding a gentle grip, tugging softly yet possessively.
     <em>
      God, that’s good.
     </em>
     It’s Agatha’s turn to gasp, and she feels Rio smile against her lips.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The heat is almost unbearable; it’s like her body has pushed all emergency buttons simultaneously, but at the same time it feels
     <em>
      so fucking delicious.
     </em>
     All of her pent up energy expels through the kiss, their hands, their bodies, and it feels so freeing, so exciting and yet relaxing. Her brain has turned to complete mush and she lets her hands explore Rio’s back freely as the kiss gets even more intense, lips and tongues are being sucked and– is Rio nipping at her bottom lip?
     <em>
      Fucking hell.
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This reminds her in
     <em>
      no way
     </em>
     of the sloppy make-out sessions with her drunk female classmates that didn’t do anything for her, a voice in the back of her head challenges her. And she realizes it’s true because this time– this time she wants, no, she
     <em>
      needs–
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      “More,”
     </em>
     she all but chokes out when Rio pulls back from the kiss to look at her. Her slightly swollen lips and hooded eyes are an outright attack to Agatha’s blood pressure; she can feel her ears ringing. She registers the heaving of Rio’s chest and the faint sheen of sweat near her hairline, and chuckles coyly at the realization the other woman is just as affected as she is.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      So why did she stop kissing her?
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Rio blinks, as if she’s waking up from a dream, and slides her hands out of Agatha’s hair, landing back down on her hips.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha knits her eyebrows together in confusion,
     <em>
      and a hint of rejection, maybe,
     </em>
     and then bucks her hips forward to give the other woman a silent hint of what she wants. Rio lets out another breathy gasp, throws her chin up, and leans away.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No,” she says softly, locking eyes with Agatha again. At the betrayed look in her eyes, Rio digs her thumbs into her hips; a grounding, reassuring gesture, before she steps away completely, wiping her mouth with the back of her hand.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha feels a brief rush of anger that's quickly replaced by bewilderment. Rio catches it, shakes her head and reaches out, tucking a loose strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear. Her hand stays there, gently cupping Agatha’s cheek.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “If we’re ever going to do this,” she says softly, motioning between them, “we’re not going to do it in a public bathroom. That’s not how I do things.”
     <br/>
     When she sees Agatha wants to say something but no words come out, she leans in and continues softly: “If we’re ever going to do this,
     <em>
      Agatha,
     </em>
     it’s going to be in a
     <em>
      large, comfortable
     </em>
     bed,” she draws out the words, her voice barely a whisper now. “If you are ever ready for this, you say the word, and I’m going to take my time with you. I will teach you things about yourself that even you didn’t know. You will feel like a fucking queen. I’m going to make you see stars.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There is no time to progress Rio’s words. Agatha closes her eyes and shivers, and when she opens them again, Rio is already by the door.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Te veo,” she says, and leaves.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     That night, in the safety and comfort of her own bed, is the very first time Agatha ever touches herself to the idea of a
     <em>
      woman.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      Which is what every woman does at least once in their life,
     </em>
     she knows.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And when she comes, it’s to the memory of hands in her hair, body pressed against hers– and Rio’s delicious, beautiful gasps.
     <br/>
     As her back arches, she reaches for those promised stars.

     When Agatha wakes up the next morning, the memories of last night come crashing down on her right away. But her body doesn’t give her much time to process them, as her stomach clenches and her temples throb.
     <br/>
     She didn’t have
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     much of a drink, but well, she hasn’t gotten any younger lately. She reaches for her sleeping mask in the drawer of her night stand, puts it on, and tries to go back to sleep.
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     It’s 4.00 pm when she opens her eyes again. She pulls the sleeping mask up, letting it sit on her forehead, and winces at the daylight hitting her face. With closed eyes she feels around for her phone and finds it by her pillow. There’s a text from Jen:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      Thank you soooooo much. Had THE BEST time. You?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha grimaces and starts typing something– but as it dawns on her that she has no idea how to answer her question, she pauses. Dropping her phone for a second, she presses her knuckles into her eyeballs for a sense of relief, but her stinging headache only gets worse.
     <em>
      Potent margaritas,
     </em>
     she scoffs, and lets her head fall back on the pillow.
     <em>

     </em>
     The next time she wakes up, it’s already dark outside and her body feels clammy. The covers are twisted around her legs and she kicks herself free, needing some space and air.
     <em>
      Fuck,
     </em>
     has she really slept through the day?
     <br/>
     Her mouth feels dry, so she pushes herself up to fetch a glass of water, but the room starts spinning. She grips onto the mattress to ground herself, breathes a few times, and gets up slowly. Holding one eye closed, she walks to the ensuite and fills her glass in the sink, downs it in one go, and fills it up again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Stumbling back towards her bed, she finally allows herself to replay last night’s events. It’s an overwhelming amount of information and another bolt of lightning strikes her right between the eyes.
     <em>
      This isn’t working.
     </em>
     She decides to kill it with an ibuprofen that she keeps in her night stand.
     <br/>
     She shuffles back onto the mattress, sitting back against the headboard, knees up, clinging to her glass of water for dear life.
     <em>
      Okay,
     </em>
     she says to herself,
     <em>
      so what has happened exactly?
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     She’d kissed Rio. Let’s start there. Or Rio kissed her– it doesn’t really matter, but she figures this was bound to happen at some point
     <em>
      ,
     </em>
     with all their taunting and flirting. Big fucking deal.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Up next; the way she’d felt during the kiss, the way her mind and her soul had responded to Rio’s touches, the way her body knew exactly what it wanted– nope.
     <br/>
     Nope, she’s not going to touch that one with a 10 foot stick. She skips it; she’ll get back to it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Then; Rio’s rejection.
     <em>
      Was it a rejection?
     </em>
     Things had heated up quickly and Rio had hardly been unfazed, judging by the lust dripping from her eyes and her rapid breathing. She could’ve had Agatha right then and there– but she’d tapped out.
     <em>
      Why?
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <br/>
     The words slowly drift back to her.
     <em>
      ‘That’s not how I do things.'
     </em>
     Agatha squeezes her eyes shut, but Rio materializes in her imagination; she can’t walk away.
     <em>
      ‘I will teach you things about yourself that even you didn’t know.’
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <br/>
     And as those words remind her of what she’d done next, when she’d gotten home– she’s in dire need of some fresh air. She crawls towards her bedroom window and all but yanks it open. Despite the cool air hitting her face, she feels… dirty. She hasn’t showered all day, which definitely doesn’t help, but the idea that Rio had wound her up so much she couldn’t stop herself from masturbating, thinking of
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     … It leaves a sour taste in her mouth.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She leaves the window open as she strides back to the bathroom, determined to wash it all away. She takes her toothbrush with her in the shower, where she stays for nearly half an hour.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When she feels clean enough, she steps out and dries herself off, frustrated that the shower hasn’t done anything to subdue her raging headache. Wrapped in a towel, she walks back to the bedroom, now pleasantly cooled down by the open window.
     <br/>
     She closes it, and lets herself plop to the side. Ugh, she really shouldn’t have done that, she should’ve slipped back into a fresh set of pajamas first–
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The sound of her phone ringing startles her awake. She’s confused about her whereabouts for a moment, as her feet are near her pillow and she’s stretched out on the bed diagonally. She’s still wrapped in the towel too; she must’ve fallen asleep like that.
     <br/>
     Her phone rings again and she hoists herself up, but her head feels stupid heavy. She vaguely sees Jen’s name on her screen, closes her eyes and swipes to answer.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Harkness residence, lady of the house speaking.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      My god,
     </em>
     Agatha. Did you make sweet love to a
     <em>
      steamroller?”
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Wh– what?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She opens her eyes and realizes she is on a video call. Jen looks somewhere between amused and horrified, and in the tiny rectangle that displays her own face, she notices the way her hair clings to her from falling asleep right after her shower.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh for fuck’s sake,” she growls, angling the phone away. “Just tell me why you’re calling and go back to minding your own business.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You’re my business, actually,” Jen says. “I was worried because you haven’t replied to my texts.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha furrows her brows and swipes down the notification menu; she’s missed various texts from Jen with an exponentially increasing demand to respond. She groans.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “That bad, huh?” Jen asks, a hint of amusement still in her voice. “You seem to be the living example that hangovers well over the age of 40 last three to five business days.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha whips her phone back around, holding it close to her eyes.
     <br/>
     “Now listen here you bitch, if you keep bringing up–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She suddenly pulls away, squints into the light, lifts a finger, and sneezes into her elbow. Loudly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Jesus Christ, Agatha, my glassware just shattered.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “If you keep– If you keep bringing up–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She pulls away and sneezes again.
     <br/>
     And again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Eh, so… have you considered the possibility that it might not be a hangover?” Jen suggests carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sniffles, and then scoffs. “Microneedling and chemical peelings don’t make you a doctor, Kale.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Don’t be ridiculous, you just sneezed yourself back to factory settings. Go to bed, I’ll bring you some food.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m
     <em>
      fine,
     </em>
     there’s really no need to play the hero.” Agatha whine is met with a challenging eyebrow.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Alright. So then tell me, because I was going to ask anyway– what happened in the club bathroom?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You know what Jen, I actually do feel kind of feverish.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      We saw you leave together.”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     “I think I’ll get delirious if I don’t hang up now!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Did you kiss or fight? Please. You can blink twice for kiss–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh,
     <em>
      the pain!”
     </em>
     Agatha yowls, draping the back of hand against her forehead like she’s a Victorian painting, “The tragedy! The end is near!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She makes a theatrical choking sound and hangs up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The rest of the day she spends in bed too, slowly coming to the realization Jen might be right. Her nose clogs up and her throat starts producing pretty unappetizing sounds. She keeps reminding herself to drink water, but can’t really do much more than that.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Her heart aches a little when Jen, the absolute superhero that she is, does drop off a care package by her front door later that afternoon. There’s soup, tea, tissues, more ibuprofen, fresh juice, and a tupperware with a home-cooked meal. That’ll get her through the night.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But the night stretches out, and she’s haunted by not only her own body betraying her, but also by flashes of Rio in that damn bathroom. She really
     <em>
      can’t deal with this right now
     </em>
     , she tells her brain while she stares at the ceiling, restlessly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She isn’t doing much better the next morning, and is forced to do something she’s never done before: she cancels her clients for the day.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     That day turns into two, then three, then the whole week. And while her body slowly recovers, she can’t for the life of her figure out why everything feels
     <em>
      so damn dark
     </em>
     all of a sudden.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     On Friday, her phone buzzes from a text– it’s Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Hey, I heard you came down with something? Hope you feel better soon!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The text ends with a stupid,
     <em>
      stupid
     </em>
     flower emoji and it’s the most offensive thing anyone has ever said to her. How dare she.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     While Agatha vaguely considers a restraining order because of this unreasonable behavior, she comes to the realization that at some point, she has to face Rio again. Her breath catches– what if she’s given Rio the wrong idea? She’s clearly,
     <em>
      clearly
     </em>
     reading into things, or she wouldn’t be reaching out like this.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Would Rio expect more? She can’t have her think that she’d make a chance with her now– it was just a stupid one time thing. Rio knows that, right? But what if… what if she doesn’t, and the next time they see each other, Rio just kisses her because she thinks they’re in some kind of situationship– no. Oh god, she’s going to be humiliated in front of her friends, Rio is gonna put her on the spot. She’s probably gonna try to be all cutesy and clingy and– and ask her to be her girlfriend? Or something? And then she’ll have to explain and turn her down publicly?
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     Slowly but surely losing the battle to the demons in her mind, Agatha eventually lets herself spiral down into a full panic attack that keeps coming back multiple times. It’s exhausting, the strain it puts on her body and the immense focus she needs to keep breathing whenever it happens.
     <br/>
     Every time her own mind brings up Rio, she drowns and drowns, surfaces for a few seconds, only to get pulled under again. She feels completely and utterly betrayed by her own body, and the loss of control she has over her own thoughts.
     <br/>
     It incapacitates her for a couple more days, until by Sunday night she figures: she should probably tell her, clear communication is the key.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She takes her phone and spends over an hour formulating her reply to Rio’s well wishing message.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      Rio, I’d like to be honest with you, in case I gave you the wrong idea. What happened the other night; it’s probably good we got it out of our system. But I do not wish to pursue anything further and I’d like to emphasize that my romantic preference excludes women. I don’t think any less of you and I have no judgment whatsoever, but I hope you understand, and we can continue our collaboration as friends.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     There. Crisis averted. She handled that really well. And she isn’t at all nervous about the three dots that appear in their message thread, not even when they disappear after a minute, quickly reappear, and then disappear again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Thirty minutes later, her phone dings. Rio’s text contains three words:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      Loud and clear.
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She plans to stay the entire next day in bed too, but Jen interferes with those plans by sending her a text informing her that she’s out on the porch. Agatha silently curses her friend’s caring nature but throws on a robe and waddles to the door. She’s about to crack a joke when the door swings open, but is stopped dead in her tracks by Jen’s
     <em>
      don’t-fuck-with-me-
     </em>
     stare.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Have you been outside at all last week?” she asks sternly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Eh–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Put on some clothes, we’re going for a walk.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Jen, I’m sick–”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t care if I have to lift you over my shoulder in that robe. You have 30 seconds.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Her friend legitimately scares her sometimes, but her brain is too foggy to fight her, so she complies.
    </p>
    <p>
     They walk to a nearby park, where they stroll in silence for a while. When they are out of earshot from any nearby strangers, Jen opens the conversation.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So… how are you feeling?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha sniffs loudly. “I’m– recovering. Thanks.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Still some flu symptoms?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah. It’s really been going–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “If you’re about to say
     <em>
      it’s really been going around,
     </em>
     Agatha I swear–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Fine!” Agatha throws up her hands. When an awkward silence follows, she forces out a cough to prove her point.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Sucks that you got it so bad.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Mm.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Because… that’s all there is… right?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     For the first time, Jen turns her head in an attempt to make eye contact, but Agatha keeps staring straight ahead.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “There’s… nothing more going on?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Nope.” Agatha plops her lips on the p.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Good,” Jen nods slowly. “Good. Because, you know, you really had me worried there for a sec–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Fucking hell Jen, if you’ve got something to say, then say it.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “There’s something you’re not telling me!” Jen snaps. Agatha whips her head around to look at her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh, and you know this
     <em>
      how,
     </em>
     exactly? No– don’t say it. You can’t help it you’re such an
     <em>
      empath,”
     </em>
     she fires back, childishly mocking her on the last word.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I might be an empath, but you’re a nuclear factory.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “And what’s that supposed to mean?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They come to a halt in front of a park bench; Jen suggests they sit down. Agatha follows sheepishly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “When you feel down, Agatha, everyone and everything within a three mile radius can feel it,” Jen carefully explains. When Agatha wants to interrupt, she holds up her hand. “I’m not saying there’s anything you can do about it, or that it’s your fault, but… when you’re in your feelings, you’re like…
     <em>
      really
     </em>
     in your feelings.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The corner of Agatha’s lip jerks up. “So you’re telling me to stop being a gloomy ass bitch to stop distracting the neighbors?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Your sense of humor isn’t gonna save you this time, girl.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha’s jaw drops in mock offense as her hand flies to her chest. “Do you have any idea how much childhood trauma I had to go through to be
     <em>
      this
     </em>
     funny?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m worried. We’re not gonna leave this bench until you tell me what’s going on.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A sigh. “I hope you packed lunch because we’re gonna be here a while then.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Minutes pass without either of them saying anything, until Jen finds the courage to ask:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Does this… is it possible this has anything to do with you and Rio?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What? Of course not. Why would it?” Agatha responds eerily calm, and she’s
     <em>
      really
     </em>
     trying to mean it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Then why did your eye twitch when I said her name?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What the fuck? Bullshit! It didn’t!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No, it didn’t, but this reaction tells me more than enough.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha throws her head back, admitting defeat. “Fine. What more do you want me to say?” Her eyes lock onto a robin perched on a tree branch above her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Did… did Rio do something– something bad to you? Like– should I talk to Alice?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She carefully chews on Jen’s words, trying to figure out how she’s gonna explain what’s kept her up (or down) all week, when it suddenly clicks what Jen’s implying.
     <br/>
     Agatha shoots up like an arrow and finds her gaze, horrified. “No!” she says firmly. “God, no, no, no. It’s not like that. It’s nothing like that.”
     <br/>
     <em>
      Or is it?
     </em>
     she wonders for a brief moment, but she shakes the thought away immediately. No matter how she feels about it, everything that had happened had been completely consensual. And the rest of it – like being annoying and having a stupid face – those things are no criminal offenses.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Which is why it’s not really an issue at all, she suddenly realizes. Sure, the kiss had happened, and it made complete sense at the moment. But then she’d gotten home, realized it wasn’t worth repeating, and so she’d handled the situation like an adult, and had told Rio. Problem solved, really.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Something
     <em>
      pops
     </em>
     in her ears and someone turns the light on in her head– and
     <em>
      just like that
     </em>
     , her worries don’t make sense anymore.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She takes Jen’s hand and gives her a squeeze. “Jen, I need you to really listen to what I’m about to say, yes?” Her friend nods once.
     <br/>
     “Okay. The… minor incident with Rio… I’ve handled it. You were right, something was bothering me, but Rio and I talked it out like grown women and we’re good. No need to pry– just trust me.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Jen leans back a bit, suspicious of this sudden change in demeanor. “Eh– okay?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “God, I feel
     <em>
      so much better!”
     </em>
     Agatha sighs happily, as the feeling of the dark cloud that had possessed her mind for the better part of the week, dissipates. “Thanks!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You– you didn’t tell me anything! I said
     <em>
      nothing!”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     “Which is how I like you best,” Agatha grins, and she pulls her in for a tight hug.
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha gets back to work the next day. Her issue with Rio slowly disappears to the background as she focuses on making up for lost time with her clients. She’s way better at talking to other people about their problems anyway– and it makes for a nice distraction.
     <br/>
     <em>
      Not
     </em>
     that she needs it. She specifically doesn’t need it when the day of Alice’s party draws closer and Rio texts her a date, time and an address.
     <br/>
     And she definitely doesn’t need it when it’s the third week of February all of a sudden, and she finds herself typing said address in her Uber app.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     During the ride over, she keeps reminding herself of what she’d concluded earlier: there isn’t gonna be a problem at all. She is gonna see Rio again and it will be a civil reunion, and they will make sure Alice and Jen are going to have the best time ever.
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     Except– that’s obviously not what happens. Upon meeting the group in front of what looks like an art studio, having greeted Alice and Jen with a warm embrace, Agatha’s eyes lock onto Rio’s. She ignores the uncomfortable summersault her stomach is performing and decides she is going to be the bigger person and embrace her too– but Rio just acknowledges her presence with a curt nod and turns away from her.
     <em>
      What the fuck.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     “Alright, looks like everyone’s here, let’s go inside,” Rio announces, and the group follows her. They hang their coats up in the hallway and Agatha can’t help but chuckle at the stark contrast in clothing from their previous gathering: everybody had looked like a supermodel that night they went to the strip club.
     <br/>
     Now, for Alice’s party– they had been instructed to wear old clothes, so most of the women are wearing stained jeans or sweatpants with holes. Even Agatha had found a pair of jeans in the back of her closet that you could see both of her knees through – it was a different time back in the 00’s, even for her – and she had thrown on a faded but comfy sweater.
     <br/>
     Rio herself is sporting denim overalls and just
     <em>
      fuck her
     </em>
     for making them look fashionable because she almost makes it feel like a setup.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     An older lady with curly gray hair and a colorful patched cardigan guides them towards one of the bigger rooms, which is indeed an art studio. There’s all kinds of sculptures and paintings scattered around the room and on the walls, and in the middle of the room stands a long table. As everybody scrambles to find a seat, Agatha jumps into action too; there’s no need for an encore of what happened at the strip club and she has no desire to be placed next to Rio
     <em>
      again.
     </em>
     She quickly claims a corner seat and barely suppresses a sigh of relief when she’s able to tug Jen’s sleeve and yanks her down in the seat next to her. Good. At least that’s settled. No Rio–
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     –is what she
     <em>
      would
     </em>
     think, if the last available seat doesn’t happen to be
     <em>
      across
     </em>
     from her and now she isn’t just
     <em>
      near
     </em>
     Rio but also has to
     <em>
      look at her.
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Are we gonna do a pottery class or something?” Alice asks her, who’s sitting next to Rio and across from Jen.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Or something,” Rio replies innocently.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Hello ladies! My name is Rita, which one of you is the lucky bride to be?” The lady who had guided them into the studio stands at the head of the table and smacks down a slab of clay in front of her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alice and Jen coyly glance at each other, and then put their hands up in sync.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh,” Rita says surprisedly, and then it clicks; “Oh!
     <em>
      Oh!
     </em>
     Well, this is definitely going to be interesting then. Anyhoo, welcome to my humble little studio, and I’m honored by your choice of my penis sculpting workshop as your bachelorette party.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      “Penis sculpting workshop?”
     </em>
     Alice cries out, sounding as astonished as Agatha feels, and the other women completely lose it. Wait–
     <em>
      were they in on it?
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Alice slams her hand on the table, her expression somewhere between surprise and hilarity, and exclaims: “But Rita, we’re
     <em>
      lesbians!”
     </em>
     like it’s Rita’s fault they’re there.
     <br/>
     “Well, except–” She nods at Agatha and has the decency to look apologetic. This causes another burst of laughter from the group.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha lights up like a Christmas tree and doesn’t know where to look– her eyes land on the woman in front of her, who is pressing her lips together in a herculean effort not to make eye contact. Oh.
     <em>
      So
     </em>
     <em>
      they were fucking in on it.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     “Well, in that case the lovely lady in the corner could teach you all a thing or two,” Rita says kindly. “Let’s all help ourselves to some clay– I’ve prepared them for you over here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     As everybody gets up to do so, Agatha realizes that this was all it took for her to be back at square one with Rio, and her mood drops down to match the outside temperature.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When she sits back down and Rio reclaims the seat across from her, Agatha puts her elbows on the table, puts her palms together, interlaces her fingers, and calmly states: “I am going to kill you, and then I’m going to bring you back to life, and then I’m going to kill you
     <em>
      again.”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She can see Rio having an inner debate whether or not to reply, but she can’t seem to help herself and looks up at Agatha for the first time: “I just didn’t want you to have an unfair advantage.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha narrows her eyes at her, but Rio mistakes her anger for confusion. “Ya know, because of the peni–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah, yeah, because of the penises. Har-dee-fucking-har.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     During Rita’s instruction, Agatha appreciates the multifunctionality of the lump of clay in front of her, as she can pretend it’s Rio’s neck while she squeezes and molds it.
     <br/>
     When Jen registers the way Agatha is going to town on it, she looks to the side and dryly asks: “You good?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Before Agatha can answer, Rio pipes up: “Oh, let her. It’s probably good
     <em>
      she gets it out of her system.”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     It sounds friendly, but Agatha senses something’s off. She can’t quite place why it sounds so– familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
     Around her, the first phallic shapes start to form, and there are multiple rounds of laughter as the women point out each other’s shapes and sizes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Now, just let your fantasies roam freely– there’s no need to stick to your own preference! If you even have one, that is,” Rita cheekily motivates them.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I guess you do if your romantic preference excludes women,” Rio mumbles under her breath, suddenly closely invested in refining the tip of her sculpture. This time, Agatha recognizes her own words, and she whips her head up like Rio just slapped her in the face. She wants the other woman to look at her so she can read the warning in her eyes, but Rio turns to Alice and points.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yours has
     <em>
      balls?!”
     </em>
     she chortles. Multiple people look up and snicker at Alice’s expression.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Hey! Don’t make fun of him, he gets really shy,” Alice says defensively, shielding the balls from eyesight. She then notices Rio’s, and starts laughing again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Why is yours so tiny?!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio takes her clay covered hands off of it, pushes her palms to the edge of the table and leans back, studying it from a distance. “Is it?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha can’t stop herself when she sucks the air in through her teeth. “I’m surprised you actually know what a penis looks like,” she quips, satisfied with the way that situation presented itself.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But Rio is fast. “That’s funny– I don’t actually need something to go inside my body to know what it looks like.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha scrunches her nose while giving her sculpture an extra firm
     <em>
      squeeze.
     </em>
     She can feel Alice and Jen looking at each other, no doubt having a silent conversation about them. She ignores it, because Rio is fucking riling her up again and she will not allow her to have the last word.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “At least there are no uncertainties about
     <em>
      your
     </em>
     size preference,” Rio adds when she looks around and notices Agatha is actually working on the largest specimen of them all.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “At least I’m getting some,” Agatha fires back. Quickly doing the math in her head, over the last few years she’d gotten exactly– none.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Whatever helps you sleep at night.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Can you two stop bickering for like, one second?” Jen interrupts before Agatha can jump in. “I don’t know what’s going on, but it’s not necessary to make it
     <em>
      everybody’s
     </em>
     problem.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The two women look at each other like children being told off by their teacher. They silently agree to suck it up and turn towards their own sculptures.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Which goes well for an entire minute, until Agatha apparently loses the battle to her own self-control and tightens her jaw. “Just so you know– my sleeping arrangements are none of your
     <em>
      fucking
     </em>
     business.”
     <br/>
     She invigorates her words by jabbing a pee hole in the tip of her clay penis with the back end of a scraper.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Ignoring Jen’s frustrated groan, Rio reaches out over the table to put her hand compassionately on Agatha’s forearm. “It’s okay, sweetheart. I don’t think
     <em>
      any less of you.”
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Scraper still in hand, Agatha starts trembling. She has half a mind to scoop the other woman’s eyes out with it. “You–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No really, I have
     <em>
      no judgment whatsoever.”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Agatha loses it and is about to jump up, but Jen – who knows her well and sees it coming – grabs her by the back of her sweater and forces her back down, just before everyone in the room can see what’s going on.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Sit,” she commands.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Woof,” Agatha retorts.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What the hell is going on? I thought you two had talked things out?” Jen wants to know.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio’s eyebrows shoot up all the way to her hairline. “We talked things out?” She crosses her arms and looks at Agatha challengingly. “What
     <em>
      exactly
     </em>
     did we have to talk out? And then to what final conclusion did we come
     <em>
      ?
     </em>
     Just remind me please, because I don’t think I was there for it.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha mimics Rio’s posture, their sculptures now forgotten.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “The…
     <em>
      incident
     </em>
     that happened last month,” she hisses through her teeth, “is been taken care of, as per my last text message.” She hopes it’s clear enough for Rio to understand, and vague enough to leave Alice and Jen in the dark.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Right…” Rio draws out the word, as if she’s slowly starting to understand it. “Right.” She nods, then shakes her head and looks away. Is there– is that
     <em>
      hurt?
     </em>
     No, she’s not dealing with that right now, she has to move on quickly.
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     “It doesn’t matter, really,” Agatha tries to dismiss the situation with a wave of her hand, “it’s all water under the bridge.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio scoffs. “The water under
     <em>
      your
     </em>
     bridge is denial, which happens to be a river in Egypt.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s world stops spinning as Alice lets out a low, impressed whistle, accompanied by Jen’s “
     <em>
      dang
     </em>
     .”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Aren’t you supposed to be on my side?!” Agatha accuses Jen, but before she can respond they’re all shaken up by Rio standing up and leaving the room.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As Alice excuses herself to go after her, Jen says: “I’m sorry, but she won that one.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I don’t wanna hear it,” Agatha says, holding up a defensive hand.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “But I do. What the hell is ‘
     <em>
      the incident’
     </em>
     you keep talking about
     <em>
      ?”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Realizing she’s really not getting away with it this time, Agatha decides to throw all her cards on the table, just to get it over with.
     <br/>
     “Fine. Yes, you were right. We kissed. I texted her to let her know it was a one time thing, obviously, and now she’s like this. She can’t stand being rejected.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Jen laughs derisively. “I’m sorry, but I don’t buy it. For you to have pissed off Rio
     <em>
      this
     </em>
     bad? There’s more to this.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “There really isn’t, she’s playing the fucking victim! It’s not my fault she can’t deal with the honesty in my text–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Agatha.” Jen’s
     <em>
      dont-fuck-with-me
     </em>
     -stare is back, and she holds up her hand. Well, shit. “Agatha. The text message please.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She rolls her eyes and takes her phone out of her back pocket, placing it in Jen’s empty hand. “Go nuts.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Code?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “1234”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You’re a walking catastrophe.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Fuck you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A long moment of silence follows, while Jen pulls up the text and reads it. Her eyes skim over the words, as a cloud of disappointment casts over her face. She doesn’t even say anything when she puts the phone down on the table and presses her palms into her eyes, needing a moment to find the right words to cuss out her friend.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Final verdict?” Agatha asks impatiently, expecting Jen to confirm that Rio had been overreacting.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Jen takes Agatha’s sculpted penis off the table and points it at her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You are an ignorant dick and you totally had this coming.”

     When Rio eventually returns, Agatha has turned into a master of silence.
     <em>
      Apparently
     </em>
     she’d done something wrong, if it even pissed off Jen on Rio’s behalf. But now is really not the time to get into it, so she sticks to herself for the time being.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nearing the end of the workshop, Rita instructs them all to carve their initials on the bottom of their work, so they’ll still be identifiable once they get out of the kiln. She explains that the hardening process takes about a day and their finished projects can be retrieved after the weekend. Rio offers herself up to collect them.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha is really, really ready to check out, go home, and sulk, so she doesn’t actually know how or why she still ends up in a bar an hour later– in her dirty clothes, nonetheless. Probably Jen’s persuasion magic, or her growling stomach and lack of food in the fridge at home. Most of Alice’s friends are there, and they order fries and snacks for the table.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If ignoring Rio was a sport, Agatha would be an olympic medallist by now, even though she does a sublime job of still watching her every move from her peripherals. The other woman’s behavior had been more annoying than ever today.
     <br/>
     It confirms Agatha’s earlier fears however: that Rio had in fact expected something else, something more– and that she hadn’t been able to handle the rejection.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As she’s very deliberately
     <em>
      not watching
     </em>
     her talk to one of Alice’s other friends, laughing and swapping drinks, she wonders if that’s where she’d gone wrong. Maybe she hasn’t been clear enough about being straight from the start. Maybe she’d taken their mutual taunting too far and unintentionally convinced Rio that there could be something more to it. She really hadn’t meant to lead her on, so she can vaguely understand why her lack of communication would upset both Rio and Jen.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As soon as she’s had enough food, she decides it’s better for her to just leave– they’ll pick this up another time. She grabs the last couple of fries from the basket, shoves them into her mouth and gets up to fetch her bag– but before she can announce her exit, she feels a warm hand on her elbow. When her gaze drifts up to see who the hand belongs to, she’s surprised to see Alice standing there.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Hey, Agatha?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha covers her mouth with her hand, and chews quickly. “Hmm?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I… I just want to say that– I’m sorry about how things are going between you and Rio. You know, I– don’t want to meddle, really, but I do feel a little guilty for– you know, forcing you to work together. And I feel that way about both of you, not just Rio because she’s my friend. Maybe we made a mistake? I don’t know. I thought I– I just wanted you to know.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha tilts her head, considering she doesn’t know how much of the story Rio has told Alice– which makes this conversation is happening on enemy territory until proven otherwise.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Thank you, Alice,” she says suspiciously, micro-analyzing Alice’s words at lightning speed. When she doesn’t say anything else, Alice takes a deep breath.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “It’s just– I hate to see Rio upset. And I don’t know what happened exactly, because she won’t tell me, but I– god, I feel kinda powerless. I wish I could do something, for either of you. I don’t want it to be like this, Agatha. I really don’t.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Hmm, so Rio hasn’t elaborated… Would she have done that to protect herself? Or protect Agatha? Assuming Alice isn’t lying, that is.
     <br/>
     Agatha gets so caught up in her own distrust, it takes her a while to notice Alice is fighting her tears. But when she finally sees it–
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh, oh shit, Alice.” She drops her bag on her chair and wraps her fingers around Alice’s forearms. “Honey, no, please.” Upon realizing what was really going on here – no scheming, no twisting the knife, but Alice being the victim of her behavior – she feels a pang of guilt herself.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I– listen. I have been a huge dingbat, but that’s not on you, okay?” God, how many more people is she going to affect by not being clear enough?
     <br/>
     “Rio and I, we just have… very conflicting characters.” And sexual preferences, but let’s not go there for now.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alice gives her a dry chuckle. “Conflicting characters? That’s a very political way of saying neither of you will ever let up an opportunity to tear the other into pieces.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh well,” Agatha shrugs one shoulder. “Semantics. But really, this is an issue Rio and I will solve amongst ourselves. I’m sorry it has affected your day, I really am.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She can tell there’s a lot more Alice wants to say, but she decides to leave it there for now and nods. “Thanks,” she smiles. “Please try not to kill each other before the wedding. Afterwards– knock yourselves out.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha exhales loudly through her nose. “Oh don’t you worry, we will,” she says, even though she isn’t too sure both of them will still have a pulse by the time they arrive in Mexico.
     <br/>
     She gives Alice another friendly squeeze, and feels her phone buzz in her pocket. It’s a text from an unknown number.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      Agatha, weird question, are you at the Cauldron right now?
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     She frowns as she tries to make out who the sender is, but she doesn’t recognize the number.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      Who’s this?
     </em>
     she texts back.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Within 10 seconds, she receives a picture. It’s her– in her current outfit, looking down on her phone. It must’ve been taken moments ago. Confused, and a little frightened, she looks up in the direction of where the photographer must’ve been standing. She sees nobody she recognizes, until–
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Agatha!” A male voice shouts.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh my god, Martin?” she says incredulously, when she finally recognizes the tall, blonde man trying to get her attention. “Hey!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Martin walks towards her and the two hug each other. “How are you? It’s been, like what, ten years? Fifteen?!” he says, clearly excited to see her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What are you doing here? Are you back from Canada?” Agatha steps back to really take him in. He hasn’t changed much; he just looks like an older version of when she saw him for the last time, which was a pretty hot minute ago.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Just for the week, yes. Wow, I can’t believe this! Come on, I’ll get you a drink,” he says, motioning to the bar. “Or actually– We’ll do shots first, like old times. Tequila, yeah?”
     <br/>
     He looks at her with a mischievous glint in his eyes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     From the corner of her eyes, she sees Rio has clocked their interaction, hiding her face in her drink a little too obviously. Agatha considers it for a second– and then places her hand on Martin’s bicep, guiding him away from the group as fast as possible, out of eyesight. She’s not gonna let this get out of hand again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She finds them two empty bar stools and mutters nervously: “Maybe no tequila. But I’ll have a beer with you. What brings you to town?” She holds up two fingers to the bartender, who nods.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As her ex-boyfriend starts telling her about his recent divorce, she soon finds herself zoning out. Her eyes gloss over the features in his face– features she was once so captivated by. His bright eyes and his strong jaw; features that had been haunting her for a long time after Martin had moved to a different country. Her eyes dart to his full lips– and before she knows it, she tries to remember what it was like to kiss them. Martin realizes what she’s staring at, and starts grinning.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So, are you married?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha wakes up from her memories with a jolt. “M– married? No, Martin, I’m not married. You know I wouldn’t.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Boyfriend?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No, no boyfriend.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So… you’re single then?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Excellent deduction skills. Very astute.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Martin shakes his head, laughs, and lifts up his beer. “Here’s to you, not having changed one bit. Feisty thing you always were.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha mimics him by raising her glass too, and she takes a sip. She knows what he’s doing, and truth be told– she considers giving in. It’s been a while.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Well, it seems like the universe is trying to tell us something, then,” Martin poses, a slight blush creeping up his face. “Like I said, I’m only here for the week, so…”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     For the second time in five minutes, Agatha feels herself staring at his lips. And while she vaguely tries to remember what they felt like, what he felt like, his body flush to hers, tangled up between the sheets– she can’t quite reach it. It’s like the memory is there, but someone’s messed with it. She remembers their kissing, vividly at first, but then she feels like a rock drops in her stomach and the whole thing just feels
     <em>
      off.
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      What was it like?
     </em>
     she screams at herself.
     <em>
      Come on, what did you like about him? What drew you to him? What turned you on?
     </em>
     <br/>
     And she knows,
     <em>
      she knows
     </em>
     all the answers, but she just doesn’t feel it. And not just here, so many years later– but not even in retrospect. She realizes she’d always been able to
     <em>
      describe
     </em>
     her feelings, but never to actually
     <em>
      feel
     </em>
     them.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But she has to.
     <em>
      She has to know, she has to feel.
     </em>
     And so, she places her glass down on the bar, grabs his collar with both hands and roughly pulls him in for a kiss.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It feels awkward since they’re both sitting down, so with her lips still on his, she lets herself slide off her stool and takes a step forward, in between his legs. His hands find rest on her waist and she puts her own hands on his shoulders–
    </p>
    <p>
     Which feels kind of awkward too, so she drops them to his biceps. But no, that’s kind of uncomfortable. Where the fuck do her hands go?
     <br/>
     She can feel Martin smile into the kiss, so she pulls back to look at him, to try and reciprocate what he’s pouring into it, and smashes their mouths together again. This time, she licks his lips and slides her tongue inside, desperately licking and sucking like her own on-button might be in there.
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      Fuck,”
     </em>
     she mutters in frustration, but Martin takes it as a turned-on groan, so he pulls her in even closer. Her nails scratch his neck and she’s really,
     <em>
      really
     </em>
     trying to convince herself that it is out of passion, but the whole thing is just
     <em>
      so damn unsatisfying–
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     “Agatha.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She pulls away from him like he’s an electric fence. When she looks up, Jen is standing there, wearing a facial expression she’s never seen before. It’s stoic, but there’s something dangerous underneath. It’s fucking terrifying.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Can I borrow her?” she asks Martin, nodding at his hands still on her waist.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Hey Jen, nice to see you,” he snickers. “But, actually, we’re kind of in the middle of–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “It wasn’t a question,” she states, grabbing Agatha by the wrist and dragging her away. Ignoring her weak protests, she pushes her towards the exit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Outside.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Jen, my stuff is still–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      Outside.”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Not wanting to mess with her friend right now, she steps into the cold. Tucking her hands inside her sleeves, she meekly follows Jen who takes a couple of steps away from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What the hell do you think you’re doing?” Jen asks her, dangerously calm.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I honestly have no idea what you’re talking about, since when am I not allowed to–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Do not fuck with me right now, Agatha Harkness.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What? What is it? You’re really stressing me out, fuck!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “We’ve already established you’re a dick today, but I had no idea you were capable of being actually fucking stupid.” Agatha spreads her arms wide, compelling her to elaborate.
     <br/>
     “First, you send Rio the most offensive, and let’s not forget, weirdly political text I’ve ever seen from you. And then you go and rub it in her face? You’re my best friend, Agatha, but I can’t allow you to treat people like that.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What am I rubbing in her face, Jen? Not everything is about
     <em>
      her.”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     “Alright, let’s put our victim caps to the side and put our thinking caps on for a second. What message do you think your behavior is conveying?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What message– I– ugh.” Agatha leans back against the brick wall.
     <br/>
     “I told her I am not interested in women, so how and why is it offensive to kiss a man?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Jen, who had been standing across from Agatha, now turns around to lean against the wall next to her. “What exactly are you trying to prove?” she asks, her voice softer now.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Prove? I have nothing to prove.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh is that right? Because in my opinion, there are two scenarios here. One–,” she lifts a finger, “you are in deep, deep fucking denial. Or two–,” she lifts a second finger, “you’re an asshole who toys with people’s feelings for fun. And I outright refuse to believe it’s the second one, so I think you’ve got some work to do.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha shakes her head in disbelief, leaning her head back. “I already told you, that kiss was a one time–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Don’t give me the
     <em>
      one time thing
     </em>
     bullshit, I am not buying that anymore. Look, your sexuality is your business and no one else’s– until it starts affecting other people. And it does; I mean, look at what you’re doing to Rio. Fuck, look at what Rio does
     <em>
      to you.
     </em>
     I know it’s not my place,” she throws up her hands, “but there are definitely some… unresolved feelings there. I know you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, do you?” Agatha spits, feeling her eyes start to glass over. “Because it fucking feels like you’re pushing me in a direction I’m not interested in at all. It’s almost pathetic– how desperately do you need all of your friends to be gay? Is being an ally not enough?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “If only you would behave as an ally. That text was outright homophobic.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh, come
     <em>
      on–”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     “Do you want me to read it back to you?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m good.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “That’s what I thought.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They stay in silence for a while, Agatha’s mind going hundreds of miles per hour. She isn’t comfortable at all with the way Jen was interfering; it almost feels like everyone is teaming up on her. Can’t they see that
     <em>
      they’re all wrong?
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Jen takes a deep breath and turns her head towards Agatha. “Can you look me in the eye and tell me you’re not aware of the fact that Rio likes you?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha looks back at her – challenge accepted – but as soon as she sees the sincerity in Jen’s eyes, she’s lost. No, she… she knows it’s true. And she doesn’t have to say it– Jen sees it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So then why did you kiss her?” she asks, her voice a caring whisper.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Because I– I thought it was fun in the heat of the moment and–,” Agatha scrambles for words, but she hears what it sounds like and it feels wrong.
     <br/>
     “No, because I– because we– because it felt right at that moment?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Jen cocks an eyebrow, spurring her on as to say she’s almost there.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Because I–
     <em>
      fuck,”
     </em>
     Agatha groans, covering her eyes with one hand.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      It’s because she really, really fucking wanted to.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     And that must be why it happened. Because if Rio actually liked her, she wouldn’t have given in to the kiss
     <em>
      unless she thought Agatha liked her back.
     </em>
     So if Rio had caught on–
     <em>
      <br/>
      <br/>
     </em>
     –and then Agatha had told her things like ‘
     <em>
      getting it out of her system’
     </em>
     and
     <em>
      ‘not thinking any less of her’,
     </em>
     then… yes. She had been patronizing, and more importantly: a hypocrite.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Imagine making out with someone, only for them to tell you they don’t think any less of you for doing it. It takes two people to kiss, you know.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “But that still doesn’t make me gay, Jen. I just– I might’ve been into Rio, who
     <em>
      happens
     </em>
     to be a woman…”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Jen looks away and seems to need all of her willpower to press her lips together at that – almost like she’s making a mental note for later – and then looks back again with a piercing glare.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah, so…” she says carefully. “You were into her, which is what made Rio agree to make out, and
     <em>
      then
     </em>
     you told her she was beneath you and proceeded to make out with your ex boyfriend in front of her.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Oh.
     <em>
      Oh.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     “God, I’m such a dick.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     From that night on, Agatha’s dreams don’t consist of Rio pursuing her anymore. Instead, her dreams make her the villain now; she keeps running into Rio, who carries a terrified look on her face. In the dream, Agatha wants to talk to her, so she chases her and chases her, but Rio always gets away before she wakes up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     With Rio’s horrified expression still fresh in mind, she always remembers the worried premonition that had washed over her when Rio had told her about her job– that helpless, melancholic feeling she’d gotten when she imagined Rio alone in the dark, like she’d wanted to protect her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She knows these dreams are telling her something. She knows she should reach out, say something, apologize even. It takes her weeks however–much to Jen’s dismay–to figure out how and why, and what she’s going to say.
     <em>
      Tomorrow,
     </em>
     she keeps telling herself.
     <em>
      Tomorrow, I’ll text her.
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It’s Friday morning and for the first time since she’d been sick, she’ll be having the afternoon off. It’s taken her a while to catch up with her clients, but putting in extra work has paid off and now she’s right back on schedule.
     <br/>
     She double checks her calendar to confirm her last client for the day: Ms. Vidal. She doesn’t recognize the name– must be someone new, who had booked themselves in through the website.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     At 11 a.m. sharp, there’s a knock on the door of her office. Agatha leaves her desk as she slides her reading glasses all the way up into her hair. She opens the door with a smile, but when her eyes land on Rio’s, she gets the wind knocked out of her. Out of sheer terror and confusion, she just blows a three second raspberry.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Eh, hi?” Rio says, dramatically wiping fake droplets off her cheeks. Her playful smirk turns into a shy, lopsided smile, and she places a hand on the strap of her shoulder bag. The leather jacket she wears is very much in contrast with her awkward demeanor and it does things to Agatha’s brain.
     <em>
      I should’ve texted her,
     </em>
     she scolds herself. Rio just showing up like this is setting her entire system on fire– she doesn’t like it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Ms. Vidal, I presume,” Agatha sighs, trying her best to sound unimpressed. “What’s Death doing on Life’s doorstep?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio shifts her weight from one leg to the other, trying to peek over Agatha’s shoulder.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Do you start all of your sessions in the doorway? Or do you have like– chairs in there?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha crosses her arms defensively. “I have chairs, Rio. Pillows, yoga mats, a sofa even. But I don’t take– acquaintances as clients. You of all people should find that ethically debatable.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I– hmm. They just say you’re the best in town.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Who says that?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “...you, probably.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And fuck her for worming her way into Agatha’s weak spot again. Stepping aside to let Rio in, her mind goes over the millions and millions of things she’s wanted to say to Rio these past few weeks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio leaves her bag by the door, taking in the spacious office. Agatha watches her admiring the impressionist art on the walls, the protruding bookcases, the Bird of Paradise by the window that almost touches the ceiling, and finally the many colorful pillows and blankets on the sofa and the floor. As she sits down in the middle of the sofa, her hand glides over one of the velvet pillows, a faint smile on her lips.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “This is like, 700% cozier than my office,” she says. “I like it.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha tries to hide the sense of pride that compliment gives her.
     <br/>
     This office–her converted garage, attached to the house–has been her life’s work. She’d invested most of her time, creativity, money and knowledge into creating a space that would be able to accommodate a wide range of people and make them feel at ease. She knows how important it is to feel safe whenever talking to a practical stranger about one’s deepest passion and desires, and so she has made sure to provide a large variety of furniture, textures and items to make the room multifunctional.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha closes the door, but doesn’t walk back to her desk. “Why are you here, Rio?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio looks up at her, clearly trying to gauge whether Agatha will take her seriously or not. She pulls one of the pillows onto her lap for support, and takes a breath.
     <br/>
     “I have an issue with someone. Or rather: someone has an issue with me. We’re kind of bound to be in each other’s life though, but the situation as it is now is hurting the both of us.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha’s jaw tightens, she isn’t sure she’s ready for this game. “And?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “And– I don’t know how to talk to her. We have a little bit of history and neither of us are particularly well known for our ability to keep our temper. She seems pretty defensive around me.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Why would that be,” Agatha says through gritted teeth, and it’s not a question.
     <br/>
     Rio answers anyway.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I think she might be a Taurus, to be completely honest with–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m failing to see how this is something to discuss with a
     <em>
      life coach,”
     </em>
     Agatha interrupts her pointedly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio’s eyes flash back to the plant by the window, considering Agatha’s words.
     <br/>
     “Can I tell you a secret?” she asks softly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha doesn’t answer, she just slightly raises her eyebrows.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “The woman I’m talking about– it’s you. I’m here because it’s about you,” she whispers theatrically, like that wasn’t blatantly obvious. It makes Agatha roll her eyes, but it also loosens her up a little bit. She walks to a chair across from Rio and sits down.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “If you underestimate my ability to read through the lines that badly, I can see why we’re in this situation in the first place.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio looks at her with an unreadable expression on her face, but her grip on the pillow tightens. “Well, I guess I’m just really bad at reading
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     then.”
     <br/>
     Her words carry a weight; a mix of disappointment and shame, and yet they haven’t lost all of Rio’s usual confidence. It causes Agatha to feel a sharp sting in her chest, right where her heart is.
    </p>
    <p>
     They stay in silence for a while– letting the words land softly in between them. It’s the kind of silence that enhances all other sounds: the rain outside, cars driving by, the soft hum of the fluorescent lights. It’s also the kind of silence that makes both of them realize they are about to reach a pivotal point in their bond, whatever that may look like.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Scorpio,” Agatha mumbles, barely loud enough for Rio to hear. “Not a Taurus. I’m a Scorpio.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Fuck, that makes
     <em>
      so much sense,”
     </em>
     Rio breathes out. “When’s your birthday?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “October 31st.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Makes
     <em>
      even
     </em>
     more sense. You carry yourself like a witch.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What’s that supposed to mean?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio hums, trying to find the right words. “You carry a very powerful energy. Graceful, too. You lean into your femininity, and it seems like you’re drawn to other people’s minds. Not only that– you emanate your own emotions very strongly.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha lets out a humorless chuckle. “Yeah, you’re not the first person to bring that up.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I bet you have a cat, too,” Rio adds.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha bites the corner of her lip. “A rabbit, actually.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio’s jaw slowly drops, like she can’t believe what she’s hearing. “That is ridiculously cute and never in a million years would I have guessed that. No seriously, that’s fucking adorable.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The smile that lights up Rio’s entire face makes Agatha aware of that familiar, unsettling feeling in her stomach.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Wait here,” she says, holding her hand up while she gets up from the chair. She walks towards the door– not the outside door that clients enter through, but the door behind the desk that connects the office to her house. She looks around the corner, her eyes scanning the kitchen floor. Then she walks to the living room and crouches down to look under the couch. She doesn’t find what she’s looking for until she gets up and turns around towards the large floor to ceiling window that looks out on the backyard.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     With her white and beige rabbit snugly in her arms, she re-enters the office. She closes the door behind her with her foot and strides over to Rio, who looks completely awestruck. Her eyebrows knit together and her mouth curves down like she’s about to burst into happy tears. When Agatha gently places the rabbit on the pillow on Rio’s lap, she looks at him like he’s the most beautiful thing in the entire world.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What’s his name?” she whispers full of wonder, not wanting to scare him off.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “This is Scratchy. Say hello to our guest, Scratch,” Agatha tells him, and takes her seat across from them.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Scratchy’s nose is clearly working overtime and he spins around on the pillow a couple of times, until he takes a single hop towards Rio and wriggles his face into the crook of her elbow.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Hola señor,” Rio greets him, giggling at the sensation. She pats the little spot between his droopy ears with two fingers. “¿Te estas escondiendo?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m not sure he speaks Spanish,” Agatha muses.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Without missing a beat, Rio replies: “Yes he does. ¿Verdad, señor Scratchy?”
     <br/>
     And like he indeed understands her, he presses himself even closer up to Rio and flops down on his belly to enjoy her body heat and her generous pets.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I see how it is.” Agatha crosses her arms, pretending to feel betrayed. “Teaming up on me.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio, who is still completely enamored with him, mutters: “He’s so… soft.” Agatha nods.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “He actually works for me, sometimes,” she tells her like it’s the most normal thing in the world. “I like my clients to feel safe and calm when they come here. Some of them feel completely at ease when they get to cuddle him. And he’s so good at it, too.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You’re an emotional support bun?” Rio coos, carefully pinching one of his comically large ears between two fingers.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In that moment, having Rio in front of her with her defenses all the way down, she feels the inevitability of the situation. The pair of them look so alarmingly disarming that her own defenses threaten to falter. She’s never seen Rio like this– so soft, so open, so… painstakingly beautiful. It’s such a strong feeling, it slaps her in the face and embraces her like a blanket all at the same time. It doesn’t just mess with her head or her stomach anymore, but with her entire being. Most of all– it scares her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha inhales deeply. “Yes, and as of now, he’s also a great conductor for my feelings as I am in no way capable of yelling at you with him on your lap while we’re going to have this conversation,” she rattles in one breath.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio looks up, the endearment in her eyes slowly making way for worry. But she nods, she knows this is why she came here in the first place. She places both of her hands on Scratchy’s back as Agatha continues, her eyes fixed on the rabbit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I take it that Jen spoke to Alice and Alice spoke to you?” she inquires, needing a ramp to launch herself into the depths of what the next few minutes are going to unravel. “About my text? And about what happened at Alice’s party?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah,” Rio answers truthfully. “Not everything though, Jen’s still very protective of you, even when she has half a mind to sell you to the highest bidder on the black market.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     One side of Agatha’s mouth curls up. Then, the weight of the situation lands down on her chest again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So– I guess I should apologize,” Agatha confesses. When Rio doesn’t respond, she looks up at her for confirmation.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Hm? Yeah, so go ahead,” Rio encourages her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You– ah.” Agatha sighs in frustration. “Usually, saying
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     counts as the apology,” she grumbles.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio shakes her head patiently. “I’d like you to tell me what you’re apologizing for. And then I’ll own up, too.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When Agatha catches herself picking at her own fingernails, she grabs a blanket off the floor to fiddle with.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I… am sorry for… being a dick,” she states, praying that would be enough. She knows it isn’t.
     <br/>
     “For leading you on.” Rio’s expression turns into a dangerous one and she corrects herself quickly.
     <br/>
     “No, that’s not what I mean. Eh– look, Rio, I’ve made some bad decisions. I obviously shouldn’t have sent you that stupid condescending text and I shouldn’t have provoked you. Maybe– maybe I shouldn’t have kissed you in the first place. That’s when all of this went downhill.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Do you regret it?” Rio asks earnestly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Yes. Yes she does. It had made her feel all kinds of things she didn’t want to think about. “No.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Then please don’t apologize for it.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha opens her mouth to say something, but then closes it again. She doesn’t know how to continue.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “May I?” Rio suggests.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Please.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m sorry for enabling you to do things you weren’t ready for. And I’m sorry for letting you navigate that alone. I should’ve reached out earlier to check in with you– but I guess I was too mad at you for how you’d been treating me. Alice brought some sense into me by telling me… well– that there’s way more nuance to your side of the story too.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio gently massages Scratchy’s back to distract herself. The knot in Agatha’s stomach starts throbbing painfully and her whole body yells at her to start trashing, to do whatever it takes to relieve that sickening feeling– to stop Rio’s words from reaching the innermost part of her soul. Her body wins that battle, and so her defenses slide back in place.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Things I wasn’t ready for? I’m perfectly capable of thinking for myself, thank you. A tipsy bathroom make-out session doesn’t exactly constitute a
     <em>
      ‘major event in my life’,”
     </em>
     she spits, adding air quotes for emphasis. “So no need to tiptoe around me because I kissed a woman once.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio’s composure drops into hurt. “Please don’t do this,” she pleads. “I’m really trying to reach out here. I’m only saying this because you–
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     lashed out. Which led me to believe I pressured you into doing something you didn’t want to.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I didn’t
     <em>
      lash out,”
     </em>
     Agatha counters, but there’s no weight behind it. “And I
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     want to. But not like– not like it meant something.” At this point, she’s only shooting blanks, just firing everything back to Rio so it doesn’t reach her. “You got
     <em>
      way
     </em>
     too personal and so I nipped things in the bud.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Too personal? When? Why?” Rio genuinely wants to know.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You texted me first. When I was sick. You crossed a boundary.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Are you– Agatha, are you talking about me telling you to feel better soon? Because if
     <em>
      that’s
     </em>
     what you’re calling
     <em>
      too personal
     </em>
     , then I–” Rio’s at loss for words, and picks Scratchy up in her arms, holding him to her chest. “No, actually, that’s okay. I crossed a boundary. Okay. If that’s your boundary, I should respect that. And I will. No more texts unless absolutely necessary.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Scratchy starts climbing up, snuggling Rio’s collarbone, and she mindlessly presses her face into his fur.
     <br/>
     And Agatha’s heart shatters into a million pieces. Tears well up in her eyes, but defense mechanisms don’t go down without a fight.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Don’t. Fucking. Patronize me,” she hisses, straining to keep her voice low. “It’s not like that, I don’t want it to be like that.
     <em>
      ‘Let’s all be careful around Agatha, she can’t handle the queertalk’,”
     </em>
     she says in a mocking voice, but a tear drips over her waterline. “No.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Then what do you want?” Rio asks, trying hard to stay calm with the rabbit so close to her face. “I’m not allowed to bring up your sexuality, but I’m also not allowed to
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     bring it up. Help me out here Agatha, because I’m lost.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Just–” Agatha’s hands turn into fists, squeezing the blanket, “just be– normal. Just act fucking
     <em>
      normal.
     </em>
     For the last time, it was just a goddamn kiss! There’s literally
     <em>
      nothing
     </em>
     going on and you keep turning it into this big problem!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     While Agatha talks, Rio carefully puts Scratchy down on the floor. He happily hops towards a floor mat and starts chewing away.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      Fucking normal?”
     </em>
     Rio growls, her eyes spitting fire. When she continues, she can’t keep her voice down anymore. “Y
     <em>
      ou
     </em>
     have a problem Agatha, for fuck’s sake,
     <em>
      you!
     </em>
     I was hoping sometime during these last few months you’d engage your critical thinking skills, but you act like I’ve been tearing your closet door off the hinges without your consent and then asked you to move in with me.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      There is no fucking closet!”
     </em>
     Agatha shouts on top of her lungs, now not able to contain her tears anymore. They trickle down her face while she yells at Rio. “And even if there was, you have no fucking right– it has
     <em>
      nothing to do with you!
     </em>
     It’s my business, not yours!
     <em>
      ”
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio seems to be putting a lot of effort into keeping her own breathing steady, but her eyes also glaze over.
     <br/>
     “You’re– almost right,” she says, her voice trembling. “Almost. Your sexuality is your business, yes. But when your sexuality started involving me,
     <em>
      it turned into mine too.”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Agatha scoffs and opens her mouth, but Rio is not done yet. “Do you want to know why, Agatha? It's because I’m a human too. Because I have feelings too. This is not about that
     <em>
      fucking
     </em>
     kiss– this is about you assuming things about me and then blaming me for it. And it
     <em>
      hurts me
     </em>
     .” Rio pauses briefly to see if her words land.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Look– if you need me to be patient, I can wait. If you need me to vent, I will listen. If you need advice, I will talk to you for as long as you need. And if you need me to step away, to never bring it up again, I will even do that. But I will
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     allow you to talk me down like you did and project your own feelings onto me. That’s
     <em>
      my boundary
     </em>
     . That is where I draw the line.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha blinks. She’s at loss for words and for maybe the first time in her life, her feelings are stronger than her thoughts. They swirl around in her body like a devastating whirlpool, forcing her to let go of every ounce of control she has. She’s angry,
     <em>
      furious
     </em>
     even, at the things Rio is insinuating, but she’s also deeply hurt by the woman in front of her breaking down like this.
     <em>
      She
     </em>
     is doing this, she’s hurting her.
     <br/>
     Rio had shown her vulnerability, and in return Agatha had just spewed her bile. All because– because things are getting way too close for comfort. And yet it’s right there, right beneath the surface, the thing she’s trying to protect. The thing she has always held on to, the thing that’s been her solid foundation, the thing that’s slithering from her grip now. It’s getting loose, and the harder she tries to pull it back, the faster it escapes her grasp. She can’t hold on to it much longer.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Why…” Rio gulps, and suppresses a sob. “Why is it… so hard for you? Why is this so sensitive?” Rio asks, her voice barely more than a whisper.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And Agatha lets go.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “B
     <em>
      ecause I’m fucking terrified,”
     </em>
     she whispers back, pouring all of her feelings, thoughts, and surrender in those words.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You do insane things to my mind, to my body,
     <em>
      to my soul
     </em>
     , things I’ve never felt before in my life. But I can’t, I can’t– you drive me
     <em>
      insane,
     </em>
     Rio. The way I want to explore every piece of you, the way I’m drawn to you, the way you feel like my equal in every sense of the word, I– don’t know how to describe that. But I can’t be a lesbian, goddammit.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She looks into Rio’s eyes and witnesses her entire soul melt around her words. Her breath comes out as uneven gasps. “But why?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m nearly forty-five years old. If I’d be a lesbian– it means I always have been. And the romantic life that I’ve lived so far will be
     <em>
      meaningless.
     </em>
     Everything I once was, it would have been a lie. It would mean I have lost so, so much time that I can never make up for.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “That’s not true,” Rio says, getting up from the couch. She looks around for Scratchy, finds him by the desk and picks him up. “You would have so much time still
     <em>
      left.
     </em>
     And a whole new world to explore. But who knows, you could also be bisexual, which would mean–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No, I’m not,” Agatha growls, but there’s no hostility in it. “Whatever it is you awoke in me– there’s entire universes between
     <em>
      that feeling,
     </em>
     and anything I have ever felt for a man.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The confession is heavy, but now that the dam’s burst, she might as well. Rio slowly walks over to her and her breath catches in her throat, but she relaxes when Scratchy is lovingly being placed in her lap. Agatha clenches her teeth, but it doesn’t stop her from feeling an overwhelming amount of adoration– for the both of them.
     <br/>
     She picks him up, and rubs his ears against her face. To her surprise, Rio doesn’t walk back to the sofa, but she crouches down and strokes his little feet with a finger.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “When I was in uni, I was…
     <em>
      really fucking straight,”
     </em>
     Rio begins, chuckling at herself. “Except for this one crush I had on a girl who was a couple of years ahead of me. She was a very outspoken lesbian, definitely not shy about it, and everybody knew. I always admired the way she carried herself, but she also kinda scared me.
     <br/>
     One day, I was doing some self study in an empty lecture hall. She was there too, we were a few rows apart from each other. Out of nowhere, all lights went out, the fire alarm went off, and the fire doors closed in on us. I knew we were supposed to leave, but the darkness and the loudness of the alarm–I’ve never felt comfortable in the dark–it sent me into a full blown panic attack. I couldn’t move, couldn’t breathe, until all of a sudden, she was right in front of me, kneeling down.
     <br/>
     She put her hands on my legs and asked– no, demanded me to look at her. Our eyes locked onto each other and she talked me through the whole thing. She even put her hands on my cheeks at some point, and she kept feeding me sweet nothings about how we were going to be fine as long as I kept my eyes on her.
     <em>
      ‘Keep looking at me, keep looking at me,’
     </em>
     she repeated, until my panic attack subsided. In that exact moment I knew– no matter how badly I didn’t want to be a lesbian, I was undeniably in love with this girl.
     <br/>
     And right there and then, that feeling was so strong, a voice in the back of my head told me: if
     <em>
      this
     </em>
     is what it means to be a lesbian; if being a lesbian means that I get to be in love with
     <em>
      her–
     </em>
     then I don’t mind. It’s more than worth it.
     <br/>
     By the time the lights came back on, I was gay. And I’ve never felt more powerful.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha’s lip trembles, hiding her nose in Scratchy’s fur. “Did you… did you end up dating her?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No,” Rio smiles. “We never even kissed. And yet it was enough for me, enough to feel so deeply honored by the ability to love a woman in that way. Which is to say: being gay for me, in that moment, had nothing to do with some kind of pressure from a community or my identity, or being attracted to the entire female population. It was just about liking someone; someone who happened to be female. But in the end, it’s just about love. That’s it.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio drops the hand she was petting Scratchy with onto Agatha’s knee.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I kind of feel like you, in that lecture hall,” Agatha admits, her voice hoarse. “I’m still fucking terrified, though.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The hand on her knee gives her a firm squeeze. Both women stare at each other with watery eyes. “Thank you so much for telling me that,” Rio whispers gratefully.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Nuh-uh, thank
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     for telling
     <em>
      me
     </em>
     ,” Agatha replies, a weak smile on her lips. “So… you never ended up dating that girl. Does that mean… we shouldn’t either?” she asks, her voice so soft that Rio has to strain her ears. She catches every single word however, and her eyes start sparkling.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “My, my, Agatha, are you asking me to date you?” she teases.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No,” Agatha pouts. “Scratchy wants to know.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio grins and scratches him under his chin. “Well, Señor Scratchy, how about we take a few steps back, hm? Let’s start at the beginning.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Meaning…?” Agatha says, and when Rio’s eyes flicker up, she points at Scratchy. “Still him.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Meaning: let us start over, and let us be truthful this time. If you’ll allow me to flirt with you, I’ll promise to try and court you. I want to win you over, Agatha. I want you to fall for me– at your own pace.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Court me?” Agatha snickers. “Hm. Such a gentleman. How do you plan to do that?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio gets up and walks towards her bag by the door. “Well, actually, I came baring gifts.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Gifts?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Mm.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Walking back to her, Rio opens her bag and takes out something Agatha doesn’t immediately recognize. When Rio presents it to her on her palm, the penny drops.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh my god. Are those–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Our penises? Yep. They slanted over in the kiln, and stuck together like this.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha loses it at the sight of the sculpture; Rio’s tiny penis leans against her massive one, the heads stuck together. It looks almost–
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Romantic, right?” Rio says.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They laugh until their abs hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Later that day, long after Rio has left, Agatha picks up the sculpture that they’d both agreed should be in a prominent place on her desk. She turns it over and grins. It’s kind of romantic, sure. At least, that’s what the universe must be trying to tell them, she muses as she brushes her finger over their carved initials.

     Agatha’s new admission causes a sense of relief for about 14 hours. After that, realization sets in.
     <br/>
     When she wakes up on Saturday morning, it’s still dark, but she’s wide awake once yesterday’s conversation with Rio starts replaying in her head. She knows trying to get back to sleep is useless, so she gets up and walks to the bathroom. Shedding her sleep shirt, she is about to turn on the shower, but stops when she catches herself in the mirror. She steps closer and looks at herself– really looks at herself, from her naked waist and breasts, up to her neck, and finally her face and hair. Hm.
     <em>
      So apparently, that’s what a lesbian looks like. These are the features of a girlkisser.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     She places the fingertips of her left hand on her cheek, and slowly traces them down past her lips, her chin, neck, sternum; feeling every little bit of skin, every dimple, every wrinkle, every goosebump that appears. This body, the one that she’s had for nearly 45 years, is a body that is
     <em>
      apparently
     </em>
     capable of having a physical response to another female.
     <em>
      And not only that,
     </em>
     she thinks as her hand reaches the swell of her breast and she circles the nipple with her index finger,
     <em>
      apparently this is a body that wants to be coveted by another female.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     As her left nipple hardens under her touch, she shifts her ministrations to the right one. Are these breasts going to be able to turn someone on? Will these nipples be able to drive someone,
     <em>
      a woman,
     </em>
     crazy with lust?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     To touch and be touched by a person who, under all their clothes, looks like
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     . Is that something she’s ready for?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She shivers. No.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alright, so she may or may not have admitted to being capable of having feelings for women– no, a woman. But what does that mean? What’s she supposed to do now? Does she order a lesbian flag off of Etsy and decorate the living room with it? Is she supposed to order strap-ons in three different sizes, shave a slit into her eyebrow? How does this
     <em>
      work?
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     The longer she looks in the mirror, the more insecure she gets. So she shakes it off, and steps into the shower. As she lathers her hair with shampoo, she wonders if she should tell Jen, maybe even ask her for advice. But the thought alone makes her nauseous. It feels stupid and humiliating to not know how to navigate something that most of her friends have been doing for over twenty years. Hell, even thinking about admitting to what they’ve been trying to tell her since
     <em>
      forever
     </em>
     makes her want to punch the wall. No– she’s not ready to share that part of herself yet.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She rinses her hair and relaxes a little bit into the feeling of the warm water hitting her body, as her thoughts drift to Rio. The only person who had somehow coaxed that piece of information out of her– information she didn’t even know herself, until she heard herself say it and it had felt nothing less than true when she’d finally broken down.
     <br/>
     There’s no point hiding it from her; so is she the one to ask? To explore this with, even? Fuck, what is it about that woman who tilts her entire life upside down? How and why had she let Rio slip past her walls so easily?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It probably has something to do with her most disarming features: her honesty, her willingness to be vulnerable and have an open conversation, the baring of her own soul as Agatha had slowly but surely peeled back small layers of her own.
     <br/>
     But what strikes her the most about Rio, is probably her social intelligence. Sure, she must be book smart, going off of her job; but Agatha is almost jealous of the immense amount of perceptiveness she hides under a thick cloud of humor, playfulness, curiosity and optimism. And so it turns out that the characteristics Agatha had found so annoying about Rio – her confidence, her wit, her charm – are exactly the ones that amplify that perceptiveness.
     <em>
      Because she knows how to use it,
     </em>
     and may she be struck by lightning right here in the shower if that’s not insanely attractive.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Soaping herself up, the memory of the kiss drifts by her mind’s eye. But something’s different this time. If it had been a cloudy, dark image before, it has an entirely different color palette now. Wherever Rio touches her in the memory, she feels tiny sparks on her skin now. Letting her hands roam over her torso, she realizes that while her nipples had softened from the hot water, they now stand back to attention. She feels betrayed by her body, once again.
     <br/>
     It’s just
     <em>
      not fair
     </em>
     what Rio does to her. How dare she, how fucking dare she unleash her predatory charm like that. Is it a game to her? How many women have fallen for her like this? What if she just gets off on flattering straight women until they get to a point where she can convince them they’re lesbians?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But then she remembers her conversation with Jen, and by extension, Alice. There is no way either of them would ever put up with a person like that, let alone be friends with them or make them work with Agatha for their wedding. Hm. Conclusion by deduction would be that all of this
     <em>
      is real.
     </em>
     And really happening.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But instead of sending her spiraling, this time Agatha smirks at herself. As she rinses the back of her legs and her thighs, her eyes flick up to the removable shower head. She’s not ready to jump into this new life, far from even, but her entire skin buzzes knowing that lifting her veil of denial just a little bit has such a huge effect on her. She doesn’t even dare imagining what happens when she, one day, lets go completely.
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     On Monday, she considers texting Rio. But what is there to say? She’ll think about it, she promises herself. And then she’ll text her tomorrow.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     On Tuesday, she figures Rio
     <em>
      would
     </em>
     be the one to ask for advice. But how is she ever going to initiate a conversation like that? The only reason they’d had such an open conversation before, is because Rio had been the one to be bold enough to start it. This time, Agatha knows, the ball is in her court. She’ll text her tomorrow.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     On Wednesday morning she remembers her own promise, and sets a deadline for herself: by 8pm she
     <em>
      has
     </em>
     to have texted Rio. What should the tone of that message be?
     <br/>
     ‘
     <em>
      Hey, can I talk to you?’
     </em>
     No, if Agatha got a message like that, she would be hyperventilating before the phone can even ring to talk to the person who sent it.
     <br/>
     <em>
      <br/>
      ‘Wanna hang out?’
     </em>
     What is she, a teenager?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ‘
     <em>
      You free Saturday night?’
     </em>
     Way too bold, and way too flirty. Rio shouldn’t be getting the impression Agatha’s ready to jump on her. She needs to be… platonic and concise.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Phone in hand, she sighs, and looks at Scratchy.
     <br/>
     “You tell me what to tell her,” she kindly orders him. He calmly nibbles her phone charger.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     On Thursday, after a restless night where she’s written and rewritten the text over a hundred times in her head, she makes up a draft in Rio’s message thread.
     <em>
      Platonic and concise.
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     ‘
     <em>
      Hi Rio. I just wanted to check in with you after last week’s conversation. I’ve been thinking about it a lot and currently I’m left with more questions than answers. Would you be willing and available to let me pluck your brain soon?’
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Nope, that’s not the one either. Is she in her forties or her seventies?! Her tongue has been in Rio’s mouth for fuck’s sake, there’s no need to address her like she’s the vice president.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     On Friday, she sends her draft anyway. Fuck it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And also fuck it that the phone rings, thirty seconds after having hit ‘
     <em>
      send’.
     </em>
     Her breath catches and she looks around, what is she supposed to do? Out of sheer panic, her brain malfunctions and she grabs a pen and a notebook.
     <em>
      What the fuck does she need a pen and a notebook for?
     </em>
     And how long should she let the phone ring to not make it seem like she had it in her hand? Actually, screw that, she’d literally
     <em>
      just
     </em>
     texted her, of course her phone is still in her hand. She answers the phone on speaker.
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     “What’s up, Rio,” she answers coolly, except for her audible voice crack. She tries to hide it by clearing her throat. Unfortunately, Rio’s not deaf.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Hey Agatha,” a highly amused voice comes through. “I’ve been waiting for you to reach out. I figured I should just call you back– way easier, right?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      She’d been waiting?
     </em>
     Then why the fuck didn’t she reach out herself? Agatha knows the answer, but she’s too wound up to give Rio credit for being patient and letting her
     <em>
      set her own pace
     </em>
     or some bullshit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Y-yeah. Yeah sure,” Agatha says, graceful and eloquent as always. She wants to claw her own throat out.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “And I guess hearing one another’s voice always conveys a message better,” Rio says pointedly, leaving space for Agatha to do the math.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Hmm. Correct.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So that the intention and tone of the message don’t get convoluted,” she presses on.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What are you trying to say?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She hears Rio laugh; a warm and yet slightly mocking sound. “Do you always shift into full formal mode when emotions get involved?” she asks. “I couldn’t tell if you were trying to ask me out, or serving me.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha grumbles. “If you keep making fun of me, you bet I’ll be dragging your ass to court.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Hot,” Rio simply says, and Agatha repeatedly bangs her forehead on the dull corner of the phone in her hand.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You’re impossible,” she sighs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “How about I make myself a bit more possible, then,” Rio counters with that endlessly frustrating and stupid attractive air of confidence. “Let me ask you to get lunch together. Tomorrow? How’s that?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha sucks in a breath of air. Tomorrow– tomorrow’s Saturday. She’s completely free tomorrow.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Uh, yeah, let me– let me… briefly check my availability– I’m just pulling up my calendar.” She forces her voice to keep low, which hurts a little, so she clears her throat again. Next, she starts noisily browsing through the empty notebook.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio breaks down cackling. “This is golden. You’re the best. Oh god. You’re adorable,” she squeals. Then, she clears her throat and drops her voice too.
     <br/>
     “Naturally, Ms. Harkness. Would you kindly inform my associate as to whether tomorrow, the 23rd day of the month March in the year of our Lord 2024, is of any availability to you? You are cordially invited to acquire a nutritious and tasty meal, to subsequently consume previously mentioned meal on a yet to be determined location in the outside air. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any objections or suggestions.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha bares her teeth, aggressively ripping out random pages at this point. Then, she registers what Rio actually just said.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “A picnic?” she pipes up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah, if you like.” Rio’s voice is warm and honey-like again. “But before you start spiraling out of control in the next 24 hours– it’s just a casual lunch. We can even discuss our preparations for Mexico. Okay? Don’t get your panties in a twist.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “How about you focus on your own fucking panties,” Agatha growls, more to herself.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What was that?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Nothing. Yeah, let’s– let’s do that. Let’s get lunch tomorrow. A casual one. Thanks.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     And so Rio promises to text her an address for getting take-out the next day. Agatha is lucky to save herself from a wardrobe crisis by realizing they will be outside; in the chilly early Spring air she will have to wear her puffer vest anyway.
     <br/>
     The following morning, she decides to compliment her look with a pair of
     <em>
      casual
     </em>
     heeled knee boots, and she
     <em>
      casually
     </em>
     pins her hair up in a messy bun. Upon arriving at a decently looking hole-in-the-wall, Rio is already waiting for her–
     <em>
      in that beautifully tailored trenchcoat that is definitely not ‘casual’ enough for Agatha’s liking
     </em>
     .
     <br/>
     She smiles and leans in for a hug, “
     <em>
      or would you prefer a firm handshake?”
     </em>
     and they order a sandwich each. Lunch secured, Rio suggests they go for a walk along the lake.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha has just taken her first bite when Rio says: “So, Alice and Jen lost their minds when I told them about our little conversation last week.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha chokes on a piece of bread. She quickly spins around and bends over to start coughing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh my god! I’m joking! Agatha, I’m just messing with you!” Rio shouts, her voice laden with guilt. She steps over and carefully pats her on the upper back.
     <br/>
     Convinced that Agatha’s not actively dying, she chuckles and rubs her back a few more times for good measure. “Fuck, Agatha, I’m literally just kidding. I hope you know I wouldn’t tell them anything without your consent.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha straightens her spine, and turns around with a glower in her eyes that, if looks could kill, would’ve obliterated Rio on the spot. She wipes her mouth with the back of her hand and says: “I hope you brought a towel, Vidal, because we’ve been walking for exactly one minute and I’m already
     <em>
      this
     </em>
     close to throwing you in the lake.” She forcefully presses her index finger and thumb together to indicate
     <em>
      exactly how close
     </em>
     Rio is to going for an involuntary swim.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Duly noted,” Rio nods.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No, but seriously. Please,
     <em>
      please
     </em>
     don’t tell them,” Agatha asks her earnestly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I promise with everything that I am– I would never. You know that, right?” Rio replies sincerely, taking the first bite of her own sandwich.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha shrugs noncommittally.
     <br/>
     “So what about the other women you turned into lesbians? Did you go around calling them out?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Now it’s Rio’s time to be shocked. She doesn’t choke, but her jaw stops moving mid-chew. Raising a questioning eyebrow first, she says: “Please elaborate,” and resumes chewing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Well, I’ve been thinking about it, and…” Agatha sighs. “The way you go about it, me, the whole thing, the way you’re so– so effortlessly good at prying life changing confessions out of me… I can’t help but think it’s all a game to you. I can’t be the first, nor the last. It feels that way.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As Agatha lays out her fears, she hopes she least sounds apologetic about it.
     <br/>
     They approach a set of stairs, and Rio chivalrously motions for Agatha to go first. As she walks past her, Agatha can tell Rio is trying to process her words without getting offended.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      The other women I turned into lesbians
     </em>
     ?” Rio finally breathes out, slowly enunciating the words as she follows Agatha up the steps. “Do you hear what that sounds like?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha reaches the top and turns around, crossing her arms and raising a challenging eyebrow. “Am I wrong?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      Please,
     </em>
     her mind screams.
     <em>
      Please tell me I’m wrong.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Rio walks up the final few steps too, slightly panting. “First of all–
     <em>
      nobody
     </em>
     is turning
     <em>
      anybody
     </em>
     into a lesbian. If I hear you use that phrase one more time, you will be finding yourself somewhere on the bottom of the lake.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha is about to call her bluff, when Rio continues: “If
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     feel like that, if you feel like a lesbian– that’s all you, honey. At most, I suggested the possibility of you taking the blinders off. But what you saw when you decided to do so; that’s always been you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Turning away to start walking again, Agatha realizes that there’s really no point in arguing with someone who,
     <em>
      apparently,
     </em>
     has done so much work on their mental health. Also– a doctorate in psychology is just a
     <em>
      ridiculously unfair advantage.
     </em>
     <br/>
     So she changes her approach in her attempt to uncover Rio’s possible wrong intentions.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I don’t know, Rio– if you want to keep convincing yourself that it has nothing to do with you, maybe you shouldn’t have been
     <em>
      so damn good at kissing.”
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha watches the tips of Rio’s ears turn pink from the corner of her eye. Score.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’d say, if it only took
     <em>
      one
     </em>
     <em>
      single
     </em>
     kiss for you to realize that you want more, you’ve either been stupidly ignorant or completely blind before. Besides– that’s the second compliment you’ve given me in three minutes. If I didn’t know any better, I’d think you’re trying to woo
     <em>
      me
     </em>
     .”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio looks at her
     <em>
      too smugly,
     </em>
     and for the lack of a better comeback, Agatha mocks in a high voice: “
     <em>
      If I didn’t know any better, I’d think you’re trying to woo me.”
     </em>
     She finishes with a deliberate eye roll. There. Solid argument if she’d ever heard one.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Second,” Rio says pointedly, steering the conversation back to Agatha’s initial question, “I don’t aspire to be a gateway lesbian, so don’t usually date baby gays. And I definitely don’t flirt with straight women.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “But you flirted with me!” Agatha calls out, immediately regretting it. She watches Rio suck in her cheeks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      Exactly.”
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Eager to change the topic as quickly as possible, Agatha asks: “Eh- so, gateway lesbian? Baby gays? What does that mean exactly?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio’s jaw drops as she stops walking, and she looks at Agatha like she’s a present on christmas morning. “Oh my god. Oh my god!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What?!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I get to teach you all the lesbian jargon?” she screeches, clasping her hands together. Agatha waves a dismissive hand.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No, but please.
     <em>
      Please.
     </em>
     You’re gonna need it!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And she considers it, because this is the kind of stuff she wanted to reach out about, anyway.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Only if I get to ask questions,” she finally says.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Their sandwiches now finished, they’ve reached the far end of the lake, where a pile of rocks connects the pathway to the shore. Rio leaps onto one of the rocks and keeps climbing down, all the way to the water.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Sure. Ask away,” she says as she turns around to look at Agatha. She beckons her with a friendly smile.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha scrunches her nose at the idea of climbing down these rocks with her heeled boots on. But, not wanting to look like a coward or worse,
     <em>
      boring
     </em>
     , she starts descending anyway. “Just so you know, that includes
     <em>
      personal
     </em>
     questions,” she emphasises, almost slipping but catching herself. Rio reaches out when they’re close enough, and reels her onto the same rock she’s standing on.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I expect nothing less,” she says encouragingly. She points to a flat rock behind Agatha. “Let’s sit.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio sits down on a rock across from her, tucking her right foot under her body. An amused smile appears around her lips as she watches Agatha try to hide her discomfort upon sitting down on the damp, mossed surface.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha decides to open on offense. “Alright,” she slaps her thighs with both hands. “One. How do you know the difference between wanting to be friends with a woman, or wanting to date them? Isn’t that confusing?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The sound of Rio’s laughter as she shakes her head rings through her body until her brain melts. “Okay, so you really won’t be going easy on me. Fair,” she chuckles.
     <br/>
     Agatha manages to hide a proud glare and wiggles her shoulders.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “How often do you want to rail your
     <em>
      friends?”
     </em>
     Rio suggests helpfully.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffs and counters: “I can have sex with someone without wanting to date them.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “True, true,” Rio says, placing her arms behind her and leaning back. “But then there’s a little thing called
     <em>
      romance.
     </em>
     For me, at least, it’s the thing that differentiates my friends from the people I fall in love with.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha licks her lips, imagining Rio on a bed covered in rose petals, fairy lights around the room, and soft sultry music. It doesn’t feel right at all.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Then what does romance feel like for you?” she asks, more genuine this time.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio stares at her for a few seconds, before letting out a breathless laugh. “Damn, Agatha. Don’t spare a girl.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha’s lips curl up into a challenging smirk. “Too personal?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Not at all, just gimme a minute,” Rio replies before tilting her head back and inhaling deeply. Agatha watches her think, but can’t help admiring her jaw line from this angle. The jaw that connects to her neck, which looks so very, very accessible–
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Okay, I think I’ve got an answer,” Rio says, tearing Agatha away from her thoughts.
     <br/>
     “For me, romance can be found in a lot of things. Sharing love languages, you know; quality time, physical touch, acts of service, those kinds of things– just making an effort to let the other person know that they’re high on your priority list. But what it’s really about…”
     <br/>
     She takes another deep breath, sucking in the corner of her bottom lip, and continues.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “When you’re about to have sex with someone, and there’s been some buildup, like– both of you are excited to get into it, it’s pretty normal to take each other’s clothes off, right?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha nods, curious to know where this is going.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “This may sound stupid, but– I think it’s weird that, once the sex is over, everyone always puts their own clothes back on. What if you help each other get dressed afterwards?
     <br/>
     It’s like saying: ‘
     <em>
      yes, I want to acknowledge our physical connection by having sex with you and that’s why I’m taking your clothes off, but also; once we’re finished, I”m able to acknowledge that it’s been enough and I still like you if we keep going about our day with our clothes back on.’
     </em>
     Judge me for this weird fucking answer, okay, but– that feels like romance to me. That feels like… romantic love.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio’s cheeks are bright pink and Agatha has never seen her this shy before. She even seems to be avoiding eye contact, which is rare for her. The moment lasts, and Agatha realizes her mouth is open when she feels a gust of cold air hit her teeth.
     <em>
      God fucking damn.
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Yeah, maybe the answer is a little weird. And yeah, even though it’s about sex, it’s not exactly a
     <em>
      sexy answer.
     </em>
     But
     <em>
      fuck
     </em>
     , if the image of undressing –
     <em>
      and redressing
     </em>
     – Rio in her mind isn’t weaving itself into her very core until she gets so sensitive that the fabric of her own clothes against her skin is just
     <em>
      too much…
     </em>
     There’s a faint throb between her thighs that she immediately suppresses by squeezing them together, but it does nothing to stop the current infatuation from temporarily paralyzing her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Satisfied?” Rio eventually asks her. Agatha’s eyes go wide in shock.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Wh– what?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Are you satisfied with my answer?” she asks, and the considerate furrow of her brows convinces Agatha to pull her head out of the gutter because that was
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     what she was implying, until–
     <br/>
     <br/>
     –that look turns into a wicked smirk, and she finishes Agatha off with a wink.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It hits her right between her legs and it takes an enormous amount of effort to not kick Rio in the hip to make her topple over into the water.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “More questions? It’s now or never,” Rio asks, like she hadn't just attempted to murder Agatha.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Now or never? Why, are you gonna pretend none of this happened?” Agatha responds defensively.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No, sweetheart, but I’m leaving for Switzerland on Monday. Remember?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It hits her like a ton of bricks. Shit. She’d forgotten all about that.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh– oh. Yeah. Of course. But, eh– so how long will you be gone?” She tries to sound casual and fails miserably.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Up until the wedding, probably. I think I’ll be flying straight to Mexico from Zurich, instead of flying home first.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     No,
     <em>
      no, but she isn’t done yet, she has more questions, more things to learn–
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     “So how are we supposed to continue planning the wedding together, if you’re on the other side of the world, huh?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Aren’t we perfectly capable of making phone calls? Texting? I’ll offer myself up to call the hotel if we need to discuss things with them in advance, so there really shouldn’t be an issue,” Rio replies. “Unless… this is not about the wedding, and you’re scared you’ll miss me.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh don’t be ridiculous,” Agatha scoffs, getting up from the rock. “Let’s go.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Ha! Got you!” Rio cheers, following her as she tries to find a path up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Complete and utter bullshit–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Listen up everyone! Agatha’s gonna miss me!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha scrambles to hike herself up, but her heel slips and catches in a crack between two rocks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “If you don’t shut up
     <em>
      right now–”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      “You’re gonna miss me…”
     </em>
     Rio sing-songs, repeating it twice loudly for good measure.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha spins around fast, swinging her arm in Rio’s direction to cover her mouth with her hand, but with her heel still stuck in the rock, she throws herself off balance. Not only does she hit Rio square in the jaw, but her entire weight lands against Rio’s point of gravity, effectively sending her flying into the water.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio lands flat on her ass, the water reaching up to her hip bones. Agatha lands next to her on all fours, submerging her legs, and her arms up to her elbows. The water is absolutely freezing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     After a few seconds of absolute silence, Rio yells: “
     <em>
      What the fuck was that?!”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     She turns her head to look at Agatha, who sheepishly eyes her up from under her own armpit, and snorts loudly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha startles herself with her snort, and so her hand flies up to her own face to stop herself from laughing, to stop it from happening again– but in the process she accidentally splashes a large amount of water in her face.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It takes two more seconds for Rio to start
     <em>
      howling
     </em>
     with laughter. Agatha follows– within moments, they can barely hold themselves up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Don’t laugh at me!” Agatha laughs, flicking a bit of water in Rio’s direction.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio sharply points at her. “Stop that. You really don’t want to provoke me, Harkness,” she threatens. Agatha raises an eyebrow and lifts her hand to  splash water at Rio again, until she hears her say: “I’m serious. I’m dunking you,” and she decides not to test her own luck today.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Creating a cacophony of loud noises in discomfort, both of them get up. They take each other in, either woman positively freezing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m sorry,” Agatha mumbles weakly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah, I bet you are,” Rio replies, hoisting herself up on a rock and wringing out one of her pant legs. But when she looks back at Agatha, she catches the amusement in her face.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Following Rio up the rocks, Agatha says: “Told you I’d throw you in the lake.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio laughs heartily. “You just wanted to make sure I wouldn’t forget you in Switzerland. Rest assured– mission accomplished.” She scurries all the way up to the pathway and turns around to help Agatha up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m afraid you cut my lesson in lesbianism short though. We’ll freeze to death if we don’t go back.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah…” Agatha breathes. “Well, do you happen to do private Zoom-sessions for absolute beginners?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio blinks at her. “Actually, no,” she says.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha nods and looks down, calling herself
     <em>
      stupid, stupid, stu–
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Rio steps forward, closing the space between them. When Agatha looks in her large, brown, mischievously sparkling eyes, she sees it: an entire story that is yet to be written.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She feels a cold, wet hand on her jawline before she realizes what’s happening. Rio leans in a bit more, and when she talks, her hot breath on her face is a nice relief from the freezing palm against her skin.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “But for you,
     <em>
      Agatha,
     </em>
     I’ll gladly make an exception.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A set of warm lips press against her cheek. Agatha closes her eyes. It’s not just a peck– there’s a promise in the intensity of the kiss. And just for this one moment, Agatha lets herself feel, really feel, what that sensation does to her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Her right knee buckles. And when Rio pulls away, they spend the rest of the walk back pretending Rio hadn’t noticed that.

      I’ve been meaning to call you, but between my hectic arrival, process of settling in, and the time difference, it’s become almost impossible.

     </em>
     <em>
      It was really nice to talk to you live last week. And you’re right, it’s weird how a little bit of distance can make things feel way more personal. I don’t mind it, though, because you keep proving me wrong about thinking you had such a stick up your ass before. Kidding. Or am I?
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      I’ve been thinking about what you said, and I guess it’s so fair to be intimidated by the idea of being physical with a woman. It would be weird if you weren’t. It’s scary to explore your sexuality as a teenager, and it’s just as scary now. Thank you for sharing those worries with me. I so, so respect how difficult that is for you.
     </em>
     <em>

      How about you just… get out there? Go for some drinks, find a woman who looks appealing to you, and find out what happens when you kiss her. The math’s pretty simple once you get there. Recoiling = bad. Wet panties = good. There are no rules. If you want to stop, you stop.

      P.S. You call me a coward for not courting you. You also call me a perv. One of these days, my dear, sweet, Agatha, you’ll realize I’ve been doing nothing BUT court you. You may not see it now, but I’m not trying to get in your pants before getting in your mind and soul. On top of that, I know how important it can be to give space and let you explore. But mostly, I’m just a hopeless romantic. Not a conventional one, but in my own way, as you’re well aware of by now.

      I should’ve said this on our video call, but you’re really the highlight of my days when things are rough.

      Now before this email gets too sappy, I might have to restore my ego by admitting that I secretly hope your date goes really shitty so you’ll fall for me when we see each other again. But that’s a secret, so instead I’ll just tell you that I hope it goes well and you get to explore your own sexuality and preferences some more. BUT also, if she cancels because a rabbit has chewed through her fusebox and she has to take care of an electrical house fire, Scratch is innocent and I have an alibi.

      I actually just came back from my date. I don’t know if it is because you cursed us, but nothing happened. I just couldn’t do it. Even though I can admit to admiring a woman’s body– acting on it still feels so… unnatural. Not in general, so please don’t take it the wrong way. I mean unnatural to ME. It’s like I have to convince myself that it’s okay, to really allow myself to lean into those feelings. But it’s still too soon.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      She was so respectful about it, and we talked for hours. I think I needed that. I probably won’t see her again, but it’s nice to overshare with a stranger sometimes.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      That brings me to us meeting up soon. I’m leaving for Mexico in five days, so I’ll have two whole days to myself at the hotel to freak out about seeing you again (not in the least because I’m terrified to witness you speaking Spanish again like you were on the phone with the hotel last week, and if I have to hear you do that again I might have a stroke).
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      I’m on the same flight as Jen and Alice, because they liked the idea of spending two weeks there before the actual wedding. So at least they’ll provide some distraction, but it’s weird to not be able to talk to them about what the last month has been like. And yes, I know I am the one who wanted to keep it a secret, and I still stand by that. I’m not ready. But it’s definitely going to be… interesting.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      The closer the wedding gets, the more information they try to pry out of me about what we came up with, so most of our conversations will probably consist of me telling them to be patient. But oh my god, Alice is dropping very obvious hints about her music preference and I caught Jen trying to log in to my computer. These two might kill me before the actual wedding. Or the other way around, we’ll see who breaks first.

     The hot Mexican sun makes Agatha’s cheeks flush. She sits back on the lounger on the balcony of her hotel room, closes the lid of her sunscreen, and puts her sunglasses on.
     <br/>
     It’s been two days since she, Jen, and Alice arrived here; and apart from dealing with her friends’ sickening smooching and generally being all lovey-dovey the entire time, it has been nothing but relaxing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She’d put in some extra hours so that she could actually take two full weeks off without having to think about work or any errands she should be running. Now her biggest concern in the morning is which bathing suit to wear that day, and her biggest concern in the afternoon is whether it's time to reapply her sunscreen. She can definitely get used to this. Sure, there’s a wedding coming up–but there’s plenty of time to chill.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She crosses one leg and picks up her ereader from the side table. She smirks as she clicks it on and it shows her the page where she’d left off– it’s the lead up to a pretty spicy chapter.
     <br/>
     This is a book Rio had recommended to her during one of their Zooms, and to her own surprise, she quite likes it. It’s actually been such a thoughtful move, she realizes, as this introduces her to some pretty detailed woman-on-woman intimacy without having to participate herself.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio had scoffed when Agatha had initially asked her why she wouldn’t just send her a link to her favorite lesbian porn video.
     <br/>
     <em>
      “You shouldn’t watch it, you should read it,”
     </em>
     Rio had said.
     <em>
      “You’d be surprised what happens when your own fantasy fills in the gaps.”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     And so Agatha had downloaded her suggestion and started reading– reluctantly at first, but after just two chapters the sexual tension between the two women in the story got so intense, she hadn’t been able to put it down. This had almost gotten her into trouble when she’d read through the first sex scene while on the plane– tactically angling the screen away from Jen’s prying eyes. She had been able to imagine everything
     <em>
      so vividly
     </em>
     and when one of the characters in the book had started begging the other to
     <em>
      please fuck her already,
     </em>
     Agatha’s face had gotten bright red as she’d knitted her brows– her eyes almost rolling back in their sockets.
     <br/>
     The steaminess of it had manifested as an uncomfortable flash of heat and so she’d turned it off to quickly take a few large gulps from her water bottle. Jen, upon noticing her discomfort, had slowly faced her to ask if everything was alright. Luckily she’d been able to save herself by shrugging it off,
     <em>
      “just a hot flash,”
     </em>
     and when Jen had asked her what book she was reading immediately after that, she’d been able to convince her it was an educational paper on the psychology behind aircraft safety procedures.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Nearing the end of the book now, she actually finds it quite exhilarating to read this in public. Nobody’s able to tell she’s reading an erotic novel–
     <em>
      oh, who’s she kidding? It’s porn
     </em>
     – so it feels like her own dirty little secret. And sometimes, the idea that Rio had read all of this too, adds a little extra something to the good parts.
     <br/>
     As she’s approaching one of those good parts, she gets abruptly torn away from the story by a loud whistle from somewhere below her balcony.
     <em>
      Ugh, had they picked an adult-only hotel for nothing?
     </em>
     <br/>
     Slightly irritated, she tries to focus back on the story, wherein one of the two women is very,
     <em>
      very
     </em>
     close to reaching an explosive orgasm–
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Then, she hears the whistle again. Louder this time.
     <br/>
     She throws her legs to the side and springs up from the lounger to glare down over the railing of the balcony. Her heart leaps –
     <em>
      actually leaps –
     </em>
     at the sight of a gleefully waving Rio.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Hey hot stuff!” Rio yells up at her. Her right hand is still on the handle of her suitcase, and her left hand lands on the stylish sun hat on her head. She’s wearing sunglasses too, but they do nothing to hide the radiating smile on her face.
     <br/>
     Agatha feels her entire body starting to buzz. It feels almost like she’s being tickled from the inside; it makes her grin. She pulls her own sunglasses down to the tip of her nose, looking down at Rio over the rim.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Why the hell are you in sweatpants?” she shouts down. Rio looks down at her own body like she has no idea what she’s wearing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh come on, I literally just got off the plane!” she shouts back. “No need to start judging me already. I’m gonna check in and I’ll go change!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You better!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Instead of walking, Rio keeps rooted in place. Agatha assumes she needs directions, so she points towards the reception. But Rio sets her suitcase straight up to open her arms wide.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Well?” she calls out, wiggling her fingers. “Are you gonna come down or what, Juliet?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha laughs heartily– there’s a warm feeling in her stomach that spreads like a wildfire.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m not sure that’s the correct line, Romeo!” she yells back with her hand curved around her mouth. “Gimme 30 seconds!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She turns around, all but stumbles back into her room, rushing to her mirror to check herself out. Tugging on the hem of her sundress, she angles herself to check out her legs– yeah, she’s ready.
     <br/>
     Before she leaves, she takes her sunglasses off her face and places them on top of her head, functioning like an elegant hair band. Snatching the key card from the nightstand, she exits the room and starts
     <em>
      speed walking
     </em>
     down the hall, until she realizes how ridiculous she looks and she forces herself down to a lazy strut. The elevator ride takes
     <em>
      about three fucking business days
     </em>
     to get down, but when the door opens, she already catches sight of Rio, patiently waiting in the entrance hall.
     <br/>
     Rio notices her too, and raises her wrist to tap at a fake watch.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “That was
     <em>
      at least
     </em>
     two minutes, Agatha. Who do you think you are to keep me waiting?” she smirks. Agatha shakes her head, smiling, and walks towards her with her arms outstretched.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Shut up, idiot. Come here.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They slide into each other’s arms, snugly, like two puzzle pieces. Rio’s perfume enters her nose and she inhales deeply. Not wanting to make their embrace uncomfortably long, Agatha pulls back relatively quickly– but Rio doesn’t let go yet. Agatha tightens her grip again and allows herself to bury her nose in Rio’s hair.
     <em>
      God, that smells good.
     </em>
     She would recognize this scent anywhere, as it’s so undoubtedly Rio– and yet, this time it does something different to her than the last time she’d smelled it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      Hmm. It’s so good to see you again,”
     </em>
     Rio whispers in her ear, just before they let go. The low humming of Rio’s voice sends a heatwave down her body.
     <em>
      Which could actually also just be the remnants of the book she’d just read,
     </em>
     she convinces herself. Still, Agatha’s words catch in her throat, so her brain is working overtime to come up with something else to say, until there’s a voice behind her–
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Rio!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha spins around and watches Jen and Alice exit a different elevator– holding hands, of course. But Alice lets go of Jen’s hand to sprint towards Rio, who almost gets tackled to the floor from the force of Alice’s hug. Jen trails behind her, more restrained than Alice, but definitely happy to see her fiancée’s friend. Waiting for her turn to greet Rio while Alice seems to be squeezing the last living breath out of her, Jen eyes up Agatha, who quickly looks away.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “How was Europe? Did you just land? Are you hungry?” Alice asks her once she finally lets go, and Rio dramatically rubs her throat.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Good, yes, and no,” Rio smiles weakly. “I’d be so happy to catch up, but would you mind if I just check in and take a nap first? This jet lag is absolutely destroying me and I cannot promise that I won’t become physically violent within the next 20 minutes.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah, of course,” Alice nods understandingly. “Do you need help at all?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “It’s not my first check in,” she shrugs. “I’ll see you all later?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “We’ll have dinner tonight, yeah? The four of us?” Jen suggests.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh hell yeah,” Rio replies, making it sound like the most obvious thing in the world.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And while Rio walks off towards reception, Agatha can’t help but wonder which room will be hers.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She spends the rest of the afternoon in the sun with a drunken smile on her face. She blames the mimosas– and the smutty story of course.
     <br/>
     Paddling by the edge of the pool, she thinks about what the last six weeks have done to her. A few months ago, she would’ve never thought to doubt her sexuality, let alone explore her sapphic side. And yet, here she is; imagining a pretty filthy scene in her head, checking out other women by the pool from behind the safety of her sunglasses (not to shamelessly ogle, of course– it’s for science), and feeling all giddy, knowing that the person who has awoken this side of her is in close proximity.
     <br/>
     She may not be ready for any next steps, but at least Rio has convinced her to open herself up to the variety of possibilities to explore this without actually having to touch or be touched.
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      What’s stopping you from just… looking?”
     </em>
     she remembers Rio’s voice in her head.
     <em>
      “You can literally just check someone out and ask yourself whether you could be into them or not. You don’t have to tell anyone anything, nobody has to ever know. And the best thing? It’s legal, it’s free, and it’s fun.”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Fun. That’s the reminder she still needs sometimes. Whenever she feels insecure about the whole process, every situation or new idea she encounters comes down to that one question: is it
     <em>
      fun?
     </em>
     Could it be
     <em>
      fun?
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     If the answer’s no, she doesn’t bother.
     <br/>
     If the answer is yes– it’s like a door in her mind opens and she can enter a completely new and different world. A world she isn’t equipped to settle in, but it’s definitely worth having a look around. Rio’s right, it doesn’t hurt to look, or to think, or to fantasize. And she holds her own reigns: she chooses who to involve, at what pace she moves, and if she moves at all. For now, it’s just her little secret.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     …and Rio’s, kind of.
     <br/>
     And while a few months ago she would’ve suffocated herself from laughing if someone had told her that
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     would eventually be the one, the
     <em>
      only
     </em>
     one, she would confide in at some point– after spending so much time talking to her now, it’s impossible to deny how kind and supportive she has been. If someone were to torture it out of her, she’d eventually even admit to calling her a friend.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     While they’d never really focused on Rio’s feelings in this process, Agatha knows how much of a struggle it must have been for her to put her own feelings aside to be the best guide, mentor, teacher,
     <em>
      friend
     </em>
     – whatever she’d want to call it, a beginner lesbian could ever have.
     <br/>
     Unfortunately, it is exactly that deep respect she has for Rio, that makes her so nervous and insecure around her. Because yes– Rio had always flirted with her, and she knows Rio had been into her, at least at some point. But what happened when she stepped up to be there for Agatha?
     <br/>
     They’re still flirting, sure. They still revel in destroying each other verbally, sure. And it’s even more fun now than it used to be, sure.
     <br/>
     Hmm–
     <em>
      fun.
     </em>
     <br/>
     But, whether or not Rio
     <em>
      still
     </em>
     has feelings for her, she doesn't know. It’s not something she dares to ask, either. She also doesn’t know if it’s relevant, or– ethical even, at this point?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What she does know; Rio’s own advice works for
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     as well. She can check Rio out and explore what her presence does to her all she wants– as long as it’s still in her head, nobody has to know. Not even Rio.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So when Agatha, Jen, and Alice are reminiscing about their college years over a few Manhattans and Rio eventually joins their outside table in a bright red, flowy sundress, Agatha doesn’t have to share the sparks in her stomach with
     <em>
      anyone.
     </em>
     She’s never seen Rio in a dress before–
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Excuse me, is that a
     <em>
      dress?”
     </em>
     Alice coincidentally voices Agatha’s thoughts.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You’re excused,” Rio simply says, going around the table to give all three women a peck on the cheek before taking the fourth seat.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     With a jolt, Agatha realizes that
     <em>
      three-months-ago-Agatha
     </em>
     would definitely have very strong opinions about that.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Well, between this behavior and the dress, Europe sure has rubbed off on you,” she huffs, dramatically wiping her cheek with her hand.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio glares at her. “Did you want an upgrade to a lick? Because I will.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha decidedly grips the armrests of her chair, stands up and scoots a foot in the opposite direction of Rio, with the chair stuck to the back of her thighs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen lifts her glass. “To Alice, me, and our eternal children!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They all laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The first time it happens, Agatha brushes it off as an accident. Rio and she are bent over the menu, and as Rio flips the page, her hand briefly touches Agatha’s arm. She jerks it away to hide the goosebumps that appear.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The second time it happens, she gets a little bit more suspicious. It’s when they’re all a couple of bites into their meal, and Rio folds open a napkin.
     <br/>
     “I’m not gonna ruin this dress on the first night,” she says as she drapes it over her lap. On their way back up to the table, two fingers brush against Agatha’s bare thigh. When she starts blushing, she’s relieved to be able to blame the spicy food.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The third time is definitely not an accident. After finishing her plate, Rio’s gaze shifts to a point on the horizon behind Alice and Jen.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh wow, guys,” she says excitedly, “from this angle, if you look right between those trees, you can just see the sun set! It’s gorgeous.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Their friends turn around, finding the exact right spot to be able to peer between the numerous large trunks, making appreciative noises once they see it.
     <br/>
     Agatha leans in too, angling and adjusting her head to get Rio’s point of view.
     <br/>
     When she feels Rio softly, yet very much deliberately, tickling the small of her back, she realizes she’s fallen for one of her sly tricks. Smooth motherfucker.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     At first she’s not sure whether she wants to kiss or kill Rio, but she settles on kill when the fingers on her back trail towards her side where she’s extremely ticklish and she
     <em>
      really shouldn’t have done that
     </em>
     because Agatha fucking yelps like a chihuahua.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio quickly retracts her arm, Jen and Alice spin back around, and Agatha –somehow at maximum brainpower– starts swatting the air around her head.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Bugs,
     <em>
      bugs!”
     </em>
     she yells with a disgusted look on her face.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah, it’s bad here right?” Alice supplies helpfully, unbeknownst to herself. “We’ve already killed a few wasps on our balcony.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh, yes, it’s
     <em>
      really fucking annoying,”
     </em>
     Agatha confirms, aggressively taking the last bite of her meal.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     For a few seconds while she chews, nothing happens. Then, out of absolutely nowhere, after carefully placing down her fork and spoon, Agatha hits Rio square in the upper arm with her flat palm and a
     <em>
      whack
     </em>
     that makes two pigeons by their table fly up and away.
     <br/>
     Rio’s yelp sounds like her soul leaving her body. It gets stuck somewhere in her throat and dies down as a sharp whimper.
     <br/>
     Jen and Alice are both stuck mid-motion, a look of complete horror on their faces.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Mosquito,” Agatha shrugs, and dabs the corner of her mouth with a napkin.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     After their meal, they all stay and chat for another hour, until it’s time to turn in. The four of them walk back towards the elevators and Alice pushes the button. As the doors open and Agatha wants to follow Alice and Jen in, she suddenly gets yanked away with a force she’s sure could have caused a whiplash.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She’s about to call Rio every name under the sun while the doors slide closed behind her, but Rio shushes her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Do you really want to deprive them of the joy of being in an elevator together in this stage of their relationship?” she asks with an accusing flip of her hand, which then extends to press the button for a different elevator.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha’s face contorts. “Ew.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Exactly.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You’re so considerate for wanting
     <em>
      them
     </em>
     to share the elevator,” Agatha drawls, crossing her arms.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I know, right?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Which was an utterly selfless act from the goodness of your heart.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Ya know me.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So you wouldn’t mind if I took the stairs up?” Agatha innocently asks, turning away.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In that exact moment, the doors of the second elevator slide open.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh, but you’re not going to,” Rio says, gripping Agatha by the waist and pulling her back to change her trajectory, sending her right into the elevator.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha huffs. “What floor are you?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Fifth.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh– oh? Me too.” She presses the 5 and disdainfully whips her head around to Rio.
     <br/>
     “So, Rio, do you think you can bring it up to behave for like, the duration of a meal while we’re dining with Jen and Alice?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I don’t think you want me to,” Rio says, while following Agatha in. “Just imagine what happens when I suddenly
     <em>
      stop
     </em>
     annoying the living hell out of you in front of them.
     <em>
      That
     </em>
     would surely raise some questions, don’t you think?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As the doors close behind Rio, Agatha opens her mouth but no words come out, because she’s
     <em>
      doesn’t like it
     </em>
     when Rio’s fucking
     <em>
      right.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     “So, Agatha,” Rio mimics, changing the subject while leaning back against the wall. “I have a question for you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ask.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Do you think we’re gonna… beat around the bush for two weeks and
     <em>
      maybe
     </em>
     kiss on the night of the wedding? Or do you think we can put our abnormally large egos to the side for a second and just– do it right now?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha takes exactly one second to consider those words. Any reservations she has, fly out the window as she looks at the woman in front of her. She radiates confidence, calmness and– is this what sexy looks like? Because– this is
     <em>
      really fucking sexy,
     </em>
     isn’t it?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She’ll be rational tomorrow. She's thought about this for
     <em>
      weeks.
     </em>
     And right now, it’s really
     <em>
      the one and only thing she wants
     </em>
     .
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So she steps in, places both hands against the wall on either side of Rio’s head, and looks at her with their faces inches apart from each other.
     <br/>
     Her body being this close to Rio’s, she can feel her pulse quicken and her chest heave– almost like Rio hadn’t expected her to bite.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio’s hands slowly slide around her waist, and she slumps even further back against the wall. She bites the corner of her bottom lip, looks up at Agatha, and her lip plops back, slowly curving into a smirk.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Shit, you look really hot like this,” she sighs breathlessly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Like what?” Agatha challenges, her breath hot on her face.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Like you
     <em>
      really
     </em>
     want to kiss me.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And Agatha is
     <em>
      done for
     </em>
     so she crushes their lips together, moving her hands to cup Rio’s jaw, only to slide her fingers past her neck, up into her hair, and firmly gripping onto the roots.
     <br/>
     Rio lets out a muffled moan and her hands move down to Agatha’s ass. She squeezes gently, but when Agatha responds by bucking her hips forward, Rio smiles into the kiss and pulls her ass in more forcefully.
     <br/>
     It’s hot and heavy, all teeth and tongue, while both of them get lost in their desperate and needy sounds.
     <br/>
     Agatha pulls back to gasp for air when Rio bites down on her bottom lip, and immediately dives back in to regain dominance with her tongue. The sound of Rio’s chuckle against her lips drives her
     <em>
      wild,
     </em>
     it makes her so much more aware of what she wants and needs.
     <br/>
     She slightly catches herself off guard when her core starts aching, an urgent throb between her legs– but she really can’t give two shits right now as one of Rio’s hands moves to her thigh, squeezing her there before gently guiding her to widen her stance–
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The elevator
     <em>
      dings
     </em>
     and the doors slide open, pulling them apart like two same poles of a magnet. Agatha can’t help but be deeply flattered by Rio’s flushed cheeks and unsteady breathing, before she realizes they’re at risk of being seen by Jen and Alice. She turns around, but the hallway seems empty at first glance. Have they already gone to their room?
     <br/>
     Tentatively sticking her head out the doors first, she suddenly jumps forward when she feels a playful slap on her right ass cheek.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Throwing a warning look over her shoulder, she almost loses her footing when she catches Rio’s smug smile, tongue gliding past her teeth.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The elevator next to theirs
     <em>
      dings
     </em>
     too, and Agatha and Rio share a knowing look when Jen and Alice step out.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Well hello there. Didn’t yours go up
     <em>
      before
     </em>
     ours?” Rio mockingly points out, crossing her arms like she caught them red-handed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alice seems to be breaking out in nervous sweat, but Jen walks past them with an unimpressed look.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Do we really have to explain?” she asks haughtily. “When mommy and mommy love each other–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Alright that’s enough!” Rio instantly admits defeat, throwing her hands up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alice starts jogging to catch up with Jen, who stoically keeps walking towards their room, and hastily says: “Okay you guys, it’s been a really fun night, see you tomorrow!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah, you two have fun!” Rio calls after them. “Just keep the volume down, I need my beauty sleep!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alice flips her off without looking back.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio turns back towards Agatha, shrugging and raising a mischievous eyebrow. “I don’t think they’d notice anything if we were
     <em>
      literally
     </em>
     making out right in front of them.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha wants to berate her, but smirks despite herself. They walk down the hall together, Agatha pointing out her room, which is next door from the one Jen and Alice just disappeared in. Rio’s is all the way at the end, at least fifteen doors down.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Poor you,” Rio says half-jokingly when they come to a halt in front of Agatha’s room. “Did you bring earplugs?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha groans. “Yeah, what do you think? I’ll only make
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     mistake once.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Well, I’d say: knock yourself out with whatever’s in your mini fridge. But I think you’re already more than distracted enough to get through the night,” Rio says, her voice low.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha playfully slaps her arm, a stark contrast with the smack earlier that night. Before she can pull away, Rio catches her wrist with her opposing hand, opening Agatha’s side up to be reeled in by the waist. The force with which Rio plants a kiss on her lips makes her bend backwards a little, but Rio’s hand in the small of her back keeps her up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m so glad you chose that second option,” Rio whispers against her lips, before releasing her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You’re being too smug, better keep it in your pants, Vidal,” Agatha murmurs, but her words lack any bite.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Walking backwards, she pensively taps her chin. “Hmm. I don’t think it’s any of your business what’s about to happen in my pants once I close the door behind me.”
     <br/>
     She opens her arms and shrugs. “Guess you’ll never know. Sweet dreams, Agatha.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha rolls her eyes, but can’t stop her lips from curling up. Rio has already turned around, so she quietly sneaks back into her room. She’ll see about those dreams.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The next day, Agatha feels extremely productive spending her entire afternoon rotating between two positions on a sun bed by the pool. It’s hot, too hot to do anything, except maybe reading and occasionally sipping her drink.
     <br/>
     She hadn’t had much sleep last night. She’d decided to read one chapter of her book before going to sleep, to distract herself and settle her thoughts. She really should’ve known this would have the opposite effect, as one of the characters in the new book she’s just started now has Rio’s appearance in her imagination.
     <em>
      Great. Ah-mazing.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Every time their little
     <em>
      meeting
     </em>
     in the elevator pops up in her mind, the sensation of her core sucking in on itself is so intense it almost makes her moan again. She’d been so sure she wasn’t ready for any physical progress in her journey, but when it comes to Rio her body doesn’t seem to agree at all.
     <br/>
     <em>
      But do I mind it?
     </em>
     she asks herself. No, she doesn’t think she does.
     <br/>
     <em>
      But do I think it’s fun?
     </em>
     Oh. Oh shit. Oh fuck.
     <em>
      Fuck yes, it’s fun.
     </em>
     She squeezes her eyes shut to alleviate the throbbing between her thighs, and turns onto her stomach out of fear someone can actually
     <em>
      see
     </em>
     what it does to her. She considers dipping in the pool to cool off–  a nice bonus would be that soaking her bikini with water takes away the risk of showing any other undetermined visible wet spots.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She lets herself get lost in her fantasies for a moment, when she hears the sound of footsteps approaching. She knows who it is even before hearing her voice. The universe has two passions, she decides there and then: irony, and fucking with Agatha.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Want me to do you back for you?” Rio’s voice asks playfully. Lying on her stomach, Agatha can only see the sneakers in front of the sun bed. Wait– sneakers?
     <br/>
     She pushes herself up seal-style, and squints to take in Rio. She’s wearing shorts and a sports bra, hair in a bun, and one earpod in.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Are you
     <em>
      trying
     </em>
     to sound like a bad porn?” she counters.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio chuckles and adjusts the bun on top of her head. “Can’t blame a girl for trying.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Why do you look like– like you’re actually about to go
     <em>
      do something?
     </em>
     ” Agatha asks her, vaguely waving at her outfit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m going for a run.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      “
     </em>
     For a
     <em>
      what?!
     </em>
     Look, I already knew you have a few screws loose, but I’m afraid the entire fucking building came apart up there.” Agatha swirls her index finger around her temple.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio defiantly puts her hands on her hips. “Wanna join me?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha cackles. “Ha! Join you? For a
     <em>
      run?
     </em>
     Listen darling, because I’m only going to explain this once.” She lifts a finger for emphasis and turns onto her side so she doesn’t strain her neck looking at Rio.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “If you
     <em>
      ever
     </em>
     see me run– you should start running too. Because either something’s on fire, or I’m being chased by a bear.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Exhaling loudly, she lets herself flop on her back, tucking her hand under her head.
     <br/>
     “It’s two thousand degrees and she’s going for a
     <em>
      fucking run,”
     </em>
     she mumbles, shaking her head in disbelief.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah…” Rio drawls calmly. “I guess you’re right. It is too hot for old people to get some exercise in.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So anyway, fifteen minutes later, Agatha walks down the hotel stairs in a tank top, shorts, and sneakers, securing her own hair in a ponytail.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “There you go,” Rio smiles proudly. “If you do well, you can relax in the jacuzzi later.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Or!” Agatha holds up a hand, pretending to suddenly get inspired, “I could relax in the jacuzzi
     <em>
      now
     </em>
     .”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You have to earn it first, chief,” Rio deadpans. “Now, let’s see how far we can get.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The answer, much to Agatha’s embarrassment, is not even far enough to not still see the hotel when she looks over her shoulder, wheezing like a kettle. And Rio, annoying show-off that she is, is
     <em>
      literally
     </em>
     running circles around her.
     <em>
      Backwards.
     </em>
     Agatha is very close to
     <em>
      accidentally
     </em>
     sticking out her leg.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I hate this, I hate you, and I hate
     <em>
      everything on this entire planet.”
     </em>
     She puts her hands on her knees and lowers her head in defeat.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Alright Ebenezer Scrooge, that attitude isn’t going to get you very far.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You know what isn’t gonna get me very far? Running. Know what is? A taxi.” She coughs. “Or an ambulance. I think I might be dying.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “How are you so fit if you can’t even jog down the street without acting like you’re going through a near-death experience?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha briefly looks up to glare. “Once again, I hate
     <em>
      running.
     </em>
     I don’t hate
     <em>
      exercising.
     </em>
     ”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah? So what do you do when you work out?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I just– go to the gym.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio finally stops hovering around her, and comes to a halt. “You go to the gym? And what do you
     <em>
      do
     </em>
     when you go to the gym?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I lift,” Agatha says, looking up at her with one eye closed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Ha!” Rio throws her head back. “Why do I find that hard to believe?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha straightens her spine and shrugs. “You don’t have to. I don’t care.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Alright, alright,” Rio quickly says, crossing her arms. “Humour me. How much do you lift?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Looking Rio up and down, Agatha brushes her own sweaty hair out of her face. “How much do you weigh? 130?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Something like that,” Rio muses with a faint smile on her lips.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha nods slowly, cracks her knuckles for show, and turns to stand beside Rio. Acting quickly, she unceremoniously digs her foot in the hollow of Rio’s knee, making her buckle– only to catch her legs with her one arm, and then scooping her up bridal style.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Walking over to the side of the road with a speechless Rio in her arms, she hoists her up on a brick ledge at waist level. Smirking at Rio’s baffled expression– she doesn’t catch Rio off guard that often, so she’ll milk this for as long as she can– she pulls Rio’s legs apart by her knees, and steps in between her legs. She looks up at the other woman, who is a bit higher up now because of the height of the ledge, and places her hands on Rio’s thighs, squeezing lightly. That seems to cause Rio to completely come undone.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I happily stand corrected,” she utters. “Remind me to never pick a fight with you?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha slides her hands higher up Rio’s thighs. “And yet,” she murmurs slowly, “you can’t refrain from taunting me at every opportunity you get. Let this be a reminder of the risk you take every time.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio laughs breathlessly, puts her hands on top of Agatha’s, and slides them up her arms, ultimately resting them on her shoulders. “Honestly?” she says, still smiling in disbelief. “You can
     <em>
      literally
     </em>
     do this to me
     <em>
      anytime
     </em>
     . And if I
     <em>
      ever
     </em>
     complain about it, you need to shake me upside down until I come to my senses.”
     <br/>
     Her hands clasp together behind Agatha’s neck.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Careful what you wish for, dear,” Agatha hums, and spurred on by a rush of confidence in the heat of the moment, she adds a quick wink.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio goes slack jawed, shivers, and she can’t seem to grasp any words or actions. Still, Agatha sees a million things happening in her eyes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Time for an impromptu lesson,” Rio manages shakily. “But it’s an important one. This–” she nods down at herself. “
     <em>
      This…
     </em>
     is gay panic.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Gay panic?” Agatha cocks an intrigued eyebrow. “What does that mean?” She can make an educated guess, but where’s the fun in that?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “It… it means that my bones melted straight out of my body somewhere on the road behind you. It’s… a check mate. For me. I lost. You won.
     <em>
      Fucking hell.
     </em>
     ”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh, I see,” Agatha whispers. “It means I’m in control now?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Hmmmaybe.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Because… I impressed you? And now you don’t know what to do with yourself?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio just whimpers.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So if I won… what’s my prize?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      Fuck,”
     </em>
     Rio growls before leaning down and pulling Agatha in for a desperate kiss. Agatha can hear Rio mumbling other words against her which get lost somewhere between their lips, but she does vaguely register the words “
     <em>
      so fucking hot”.
     </em>
     It’s the second time in twenty-four hours Rio tells her that– and she can’t say she hates it. At all.

     Agatha needs the rest of the day to cool down, and to gather courage for sitting through another dinner with the four of them. Rio seems to be enjoying herself eliciting the most ridiculous eye rolls and most annoyed huffs from Agatha, much to Jen and Alice’s entertainment.
    </p>
    <p>
     “With all of the bickering between you two, this might as well be
     <em>
      your
     </em>
     wedding trip,” Alice remarks after Rio
     <em>
      accidentally
     </em>
     spills a bit of her drink down Agatha’s thigh, earning herself an elbow to the ribs. Unrelatedly, this seems to be the exact moment Rio’s provocations lower in frequency.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When it’s time for all of them to go to bed, Rio waits for the perfect unguarded moment to blow her a sneaky kiss – earning herself one last eye roll – and tells Agatha she’ll pick her up tomorrow to talk about wedding preparations.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Still, Agatha doesn’t expect the knock on her door the next morning, as she’d imagined Rio would try to find her outside later.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She unlocks the door and opens it about an inch, just enough to peer through the opening.
     <br/>
     “Oh, hello there,” she says when her eyes meet those lively brown ones. She tries to maintain eye contact to pretend she doesn’t notice Rio’s abs on full display under her bikini top and a cropped blouse that hangs open.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio casually tips her chin forward. “What’s going on? Are you naked or are you hiding a wanted criminal in there?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “If you wanna call him a wanted criminal, sure. I just let Scratch out on the loose in here–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      Scratchy is here?”
     </em>
     Rio’s eyes go wide.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Well, yeah,” Agatha says, slightly piqued. “He can’t really take care of himself at home, can he?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You took him
     <em>
      on the plane?”
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No, he swam. His canoe broke,” Agatha deadpans.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Well, can I say hi? I missed him too! Can’t believe you didn’t tell me he was here.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      Too?”
     </em>
     Agatha smirks. “I mean, you didn’t ask. And he has abandonment issues. But sure, if you two promise not to gang up on me again, come in.” She looks over her shoulder to gauge whether it’s safe to open the door wider.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Uh– Agatha, wait,” Rio says, suspiciously shy. Agatha looks back at her and is intrigued when she watches Rio nervously suck in her cheeks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I– I’d rather not. I don’t want to come in,” she says, rubbing her shoe over an invisible stain in the carpet. “I don’t want to put myself in a room with a bed and you as the only other person in that room.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha lifts an eyebrow, unsure if this is another flirtation attempt, or if Rio is genuinely concerned.
     <br/>
     She doesn’t need very long to read the other woman’s body language– this is definitely a respectful way to keep them from crossing any boundaries. For either of them.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She scolds herself for feeling the tiniest bit disappointed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh, eh– yeah, good call,” she nods. “Wait here.” She turns back around, scooping Scratchy up from where he’s nibbling one of her shoelaces, and carries him to the door.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Señor Scratchy!” Rio calls out excitedly, but she’s immediately shushed by Agatha.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Keep it down,” she hisses, while still placing the rabbit into Rio’s arms. “The hotel staff doesn’t know he’s here.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio chuckles as she adjusts him in her arms, gently massaging the spot behind his ears.
     <br/>
     <em>
      “¿Te acuerdas de mí? Soy la futura novia de tu mamá
     </em>
     ,
     <em>
      ”
     </em>
     she coos with rapid tongue, a sly smirk on her face.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What are you telling him? Unbelievable, not even reunited for three seconds and you’re already planning to take over my reign.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Lifting one of his ears up, Rio leans in and stage-whispers: “You’ve been such a good spy for me, señor.
     <em>
      Y has cuidado muy bien de tu madre mientras yo estaba fuera.
     </em>
     ” He gratefully starts chewing away at a loose strand of hair.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Alright, I think that’s enough,” Agatha says sternly, but she can’t hide an endeared smile. “When I wake up with him holding a gun to my head, I know who to blame.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As she takes him back from the other woman’s arms, Rio asks: “Doesn’t he get hot in there? Does he have food?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No, I took bets on whether he will overheat or starve first,” Agatha rolls her eyes. “Obviously. I keep the aircon on all day, and he has more food and toys than he could ever dream of. I might occasionally even steal some fresh lettuce for him. Besides, he’s no stranger to screaming at me if he actually needs something. But we appreciate your concern, don’t we Scratch?”
     <br/>
     She lifts his paw and waves at Rio, before returning him to the room. Next, she takes her phone, handbag, and keycard, and walks out into the hallway, closing the door with a soft click. As they walk down to the elevators, Rio shakes her head, smiling incredulously.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I still can’t believe you brought him,” she snickers.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha scowls at her from the corner of her eye. “Are you laughing at me, Vidal?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I would never!” she replies, throwing her hands up in innocence. “No, I’m not laughing at you. I just can’t comprehend how adorable that is.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “If you call me adorable
     <em>
      one more time–”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     “Don’t flatter yourself, Harkness. I’m talking about Scratchy.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Sure you are.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When they find a secluded spot on the outside deck of the bar to look at their to-do list, Agatha is pleasantly surprised to see how much of it is already crossed off by Rio.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      Really?”
     </em>
     she asks, eyebrows shooting up. “You’ve taken care of
     <em>
      all
     </em>
     the decorations for the rehearsal dinner
     <em>
      and
     </em>
     the wedding?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio smirks as she tucks a strand of her behind her ear. “Of course, sweetheart. I knew you would hate it, so–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha glares at her. “You’re lying.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah, I am. You’d be surprised how much the hotel staff is willing to provide if you speak their language.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And Agatha gets that.
     <em>
      You could literally make me do anything after hearing you speak Spanish,
     </em>
     she thinks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     What’s left for them to do is write speeches,
     <em>
      again,
     </em>
     make a playlist for the band, and discuss the time table for the actual wedding with Alice and Jen. They’d hired an actor to officiate the wedding (as per the couple’s request– they plan to get eloped one day after their return from Mexico) and so they would have to rehearse the ceremony when the fake officiant arrives, which will be on the day of the rehearsal dinner.
     <br/>
     Agatha suggests she can coordinate the rehearsal, if Rio takes responsibility for the coordination of the guests.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Do you have a wedding gift for them?” Rio asks her while wrapping up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Please,” Agatha scoffs. “My gift is that I will try to keep my gagging to a minimum when they kiss. For 24 whole hours.”
     <br/>
     In truth, she had commissioned an artist to draw up one of Jen and Alice’s favorite photos. She has a large painted canvas of their portrait at home, which she will bring over to their house after the wedding.
     <br/>
     “What about you?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I rented a cabin in the woods for them, for a weekend in September,” Rio says proudly. “It’s super charming, it suits them. Wanna see?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha nods and Rio whips out her phone. She pulls up photos of the cottage and hands it over.
     <br/>
     Agatha does indeed see the charm– there’s lots of wood, candles and fairy lights, but also a set of large windows to really connect with the forest. There’s a clawfoot bathtub in what seems to be the middle of the living room.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Romantic,” Agatha quips.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You sound surprised.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah– no, I mean– I didn’t think you had it in you–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio puts her hand on her chest, pretending to be hurt. “Ouch. Even after I told you what a hopeless romantic I am.” She takes her phone back and puts it in her pocket.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha is really trying to stop herself from saying the words that are about to leave her mouth, but she loses that battle. “I’ve yet to see proof of that,” she mumbles.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Well, do you want to?” The way Rio crosses her legs and casually leans back in her chair completely parries any attempt to turn it into a joke, and Agatha feels like she accidentally turned into a dead end.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She doesn’t know where to look and realizes she has to say something, but when she opens her mouth, only a few elongated vowels come out.
     <br/>
     Watching Rio tapping her fingers on the arm rest with an amused grin, she figures the only way is through.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I think my brain short-circuited,” Agatha snorts.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio nods slowly, her tongue sliding over her bottom lip. “If only there was a word for that feeling,” she wonders playfully. The sparkle in her eyes completely disintegrates any bones that were still left in Agatha’s body. “Sounds familiar, right?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “It does ring a bell,” Agatha reluctantly agrees.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Don’t be embarrassed,” Rio kindly says, putting both legs back on the ground and leaning forward with her forearms on her knees. It gives Agatha a perfect view of her cleavage.
     <br/>
     “The panic makes you feel alive. You could choose to enjoy it.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio maintains eye contact and tilts her head to the side– a question, or a challenge? It makes Agatha’s insides clench, which is kind of uncomfortable at first, but then she lets Rio’s words sink in.
     <em>
      You could choose to enjoy it.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     So she makes a choice. And the clenching remains, but the discomfort dissolves, leaving behind a tickling sensation that sends a giggle all the way up to her throat. She covers the lower half of her face before it comes out, however.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Do you want it to stop?” Rio whispers. “Because I can make it stop.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And Agatha shakes her head, because she
     <em>
      really doesn’t
     </em>
     , but she also
     <em>
      needs
     </em>
     to find a way to regain her control from where she is now.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She keeps staring, just taking in the way Rio is looking at
     <em>
      her,
     </em>
     and she wonders what she can do to flip their positions. The answer is right there– it’s in her micro expressions, it’s in the way she forces herself to breathe slowly, it’s in the tension in her jaw, it’s in the wanting look in her eyes: Rio is down just as bad as she is. And if there’s anything Agatha is good at, it’s using that information to her advantage.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You’re right,” she says, dropping her hand to her chest, absently tracing her clavicle with her middle finger. “It is exciting. But the tension– it’s almost
     <em>
      too much
     </em>
     .”
     <br/>
     She watches the slightest twitch in Rio’s eyes, and so she swaggers on.
     <br/>
     “I believe you mentioned something about a jacuzzi the other day? That sounds
     <em>
      exactly
     </em>
     like something an old crone like me needs, tonight around 11 or so.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio inhales sharply through her nose, and Agatha gets up.
     <br/>
     “Where did you say it was again?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio points up. “Roof,” she says throatily.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Hm,” Agatha nods. She rubs her neck once for good measure, and turns to leave the bar with a light sway in her hips.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The water is nice. It’s late at night and because the sun has set a while ago, a chilly breeze blows over the top level of the hotel. Agatha has sunk herself down in the large jacuzzi that could easily fit 10 people. She’s submerged all the way to her shoulders, and soft lighting from inside the tub casts a subtle glow on her face, which is framed by a few strands of hair hanging loose from her bun.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She presses a button to activate the jets, and wonders if she should doubt whether Rio will join her eventually– but there’s no question, really. She knows she will.
     <br/>
     With her stomach nervously fluttering, she tries to embrace the feeling of anticipation.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The jacuzzi bubbles and buzzes loudly, sending steady streams of water through the tub. And indeed; not even five minutes later, the door which connects the top level to the terrace opens, and Rio appears in a light robe, a towel draped over her arm.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They acknowledge each other with a wordless smile. Rio places her towel next to Agatha’s, and discards the robe in one quick movement. For one brief second Agatha wonders if she should be discreet and look away– but no, she decides to shamelessly take in every inch of Rio’s bikini clad body as she lowers herself into the tub. What else would Rio expect her to do?
     <br/>
     She lets her eyes roam over toned abs, thighs, flawless and tanned skin, the valley between her breasts… Yeah, Agatha is definitely starting to understand what there is to appreciate about a woman’s body. But it’s not the first time she’s seeing Rio’s minimally covered skin, so where is this attraction coming from? Has this really never stood out to her before? Was she
     <em>
      blind?
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Rio slides into the far end of the tub, across and out of reach from Agatha. Smart move, she guesses, as she watches the bubbling water splash up against her shoulders.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio blinks at her with a knowing smile, closes her eyes, and exhales. Agatha decides to do the same, just letting her body relax for a while. She focuses on her breathing, and
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     on the woman across from her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     After ten minutes the jets die down, and suddenly it’s nearly silent. Agatha opens her eyes and is met with the view of Rio’s bright pink cheeks from the warmth.
     <br/>
     She notices Agatha’s staring and sinks herself further back, until just her nose is above the water.
     <br/>
     Agatha pushes herself up a bit and smiles coyly. Now that it’s quiet, they can talk.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’ve been meaning to ask you how far into your lesson program we are,” she says, cocking her head to the side. “I’m waiting for my second quiz.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio laughs, which causes the water to bubble up and splash her in the face. She tilts her chin up so she can reply.
     <br/>
     “You didn’t exactly pass the first one, so I’m starting to think I’m a bad teacher.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I didn’t pass?” Agatha cries out, deeply shocked. “Look, first of all, my answers weren’t wrong– your questions were open to interpretation. I might as well be right. Secondly, eight hours is
     <em>
      ridiculous–
     </em>
     ”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “God, you must have been a menace in college.” Grinning, Rio pushes herself upright again. “But yeah, your creativity was appreciated.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So why didn’t I pass?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You left the bonus question completely open,” Rio shrugs. “You failed for not even trying.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha tries to remember what the bonus question was–
     <br/>
     “Oh! The
     <em>
      ‘good girl’
     </em>
     question? Yeah, to be honest, I still don’t understand that one.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What is there not to understand?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Does that really
     <em>
      do
     </em>
     something for you? I just don’t– I’m not a
     <em>
      dog,
     </em>
     you know. I don’t need a reward for sitting down and barking on command.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Shaking her head, Rio laughs again. “M-hm. Yeah, no, you’re right,” she says, seemingly admitting defeat. “You’re not a dog. Fair enough.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio starts tracing the water surface with her palm and asks after a few moments of silence: “How do
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     feel it’s going?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha thinks about that for a while. And while she likes to poke at Rio’s composure, she feels like they’ve approached the serious part of their conversation. She drops her gaze and studies her own legs, which look weirdly shaped because of how the light breaks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’ve been… thinking about it.
     <em>
      A lot.”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     “You’ve been thinking,” Rio repeats, just a hint of mocking in her voice.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Thinking, yes. And– and reading. Watching. Looking. Imagining. Fantasizing."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Touching…?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No. No touching. Still can’t do it. I’m just still so aware of the fact that it’s about… a woman’s body.” Agatha scolds herself for not daring to look up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio hums softly. “Well, once again, I think it comes down to the question: would you
     <em>
      want to?”
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “That’s the thing.
     <em>
      I don’t know
     </em>
     .”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As she hears those words leaving her own mouth, she wonders if they’re true. It’s what she’s been telling herself from the beginning: kissing a woman is fine, but anything
     <em>
      more–
     </em>
     No, that makes it too real.
     <br/>
     Just the idea of undressing and being undressed, having to caress boobs or a pussy, with her hands, fingers, or
     <em>
      even her tongue
     </em>
     – she wouldn’t even know what to do.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Sure, she can imagine it when she reads about it, but if it would be
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     …
     <br/>
     Her brain can’t even go there. The thought alone has always made her shiver.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But– that conviction had been from a time when, if she were to imagine herself touching a female body, it would be one of an unknown person. Just skin, muscles, birthmarks, nipples, body hair, a vagina; all of it on one torso with a faceless head.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Now, the person sitting in front of her
     <em>
      does
     </em>
     have a face. And not even an ugly one at that.
     <br/>
     She doesn’t
     <em>
      just
     </em>
     have a face, either; she has charisma, she has opinions, she has her own ideas. She has this
     <em>
      look
     </em>
     in her eyes, and a way with words. She has a deep and lasting effect on Agatha. She has a beautiful body which she wouldn’t mind studying for hours and hours. She has a personality, and she has a name. Rio.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And that switches things up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Actually– I do know. I know I want to.
     <em>
      ”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     It makes sense now. She doesn’t want or need a random woman; she wants
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     , who just happens to have those features she’s so scared of exploring on a different body than her own.
     <br/>
     Features that now, from this new perspective, seem a lot more appealing and have an interesting effect on her own libido.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I just don’t know
     <em>
      how.
     </em>
     I’m not ready. I’m so scared to… get it all wrong.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When Rio doesn’t immediately answer, she bashfully looks up through her eyelashes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “As long as everything that happens is consensual, there is very little you can do wrong,” Rio says with an encouraging smile. Then, after taking a breath, she adds: “And I’m sure the first woman you’ll sleep with, will agree with me.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha shakes her head in confusion.
     <em>
      What? Shit–
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wait, is that not going to be you?” she asks out of pure astonishment, but as soon as she’s said it, her eyes go wide.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      Oh my god.
     </em>
     Can she drown herself here? If she pushes herself under right now, how long would it take to actually die? Are there any other possibilities? She could always throw herself off the roof…
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha is used to Rio’s smugness and her smirks, but when she looks up at Rio now, she’s not sure she has ever seen her
     <em>
      this
     </em>
     self-satisfied. Fuck. This is not how this is supposed to go.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m not sure I’m your best option,” Rio acts all timidly. “I’m a bad teacher, remember?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha scoffs. “Please. I wouldn’t want to sleep with you as
     <em>
      my teacher
     </em>
     , but as my–”
     <br/>
     Again, her words get stuck in her throat. How does she manage to turn this into even more of an awkward confession?
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <br/>
     “As your what?” Rio asks, and the damn motherfucking smirk is back.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Shut up,” Agatha snaps, deliberately splashing her with a large amount of water. It’s a larger wave than she’d meant to hit Rio with, but honestly,
     <em>
      she fucking deserved it.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Rio swipes her –now wet– hair back, uncovering a highly dangerous expression on her face. Agatha gulps. She half expects Rio to get back at her, but the other woman seems to be taking the high road by taking long, slow breaths through her nose.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Just remember what I told you a few months ago, Agatha,” she says calmly, closing her eyes and leaning back again. “If you’re ever ready, you know where to find me. Just say the word.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And Agatha decides that that’s such a dick move; because by closing her eyes, Rio has made it totally Agatha’s call whether she wants to continue this conversation, and ultimately whether she wants to take initiative in asking for what she wants.
     <em>
      Thoughtful bastard.
      <br/>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Agatha huffs and leans her head back. “Why can’t there just be… some gateway, instead of having to dive all the way in?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “We can make one,” Rio suggests. “We can just talk about it.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Talk about what?” Agatha knows the answer, but she needs Rio to be clear.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “About sex.” When Rio opens her eyes, there’s no challenging grin, like Agatha expected. Instead, she looks genuine and inviting. “What do you usually like?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What do I…” Oh god. Are they really talking about this?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yes, let’s start at the base. When you had sex before, with a man, what was your favorite part?” When Agatha’s eyes dart away, Rio’s voice softens. “Hey– if you’re not comfortable with this, you can say no. Okay?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha bites her lip. She’s not going to back down now. “No, I– just let me think for a minute.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio nods patiently. It’s almost
     <em>
      annoying
     </em>
     how much effort she puts into make Agatha feel at ease.
     <br/>
     Her mind goes back to the last time she’d had sex, which was quite a while ago. Hmm. What
     <em>
      does
     </em>
     she like about it?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Well obviously, it can make my body feel good. And it can make me feel attractive; I like that.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio smiles. “So fair. What else?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Uhm… I think– I think my favorite part is actually foreplay.” Not wanting to lose herself in her own embarrassment again, she chooses to keep her head up this time.
     <br/>
     She kind of regrets that when there’s the faintest of twitches around Rio’s mouth, like she’s having an inside joke.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Realizing that Agatha clocked her, she explains: “I’m sorry. But that’s just so very gay of you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha gives her a look. “Do you want me to continue?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yes, please. Sorry. What do you like about it?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m sure you can imagine.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’d like you to explain it to me. It’s not really a conversation if we just… imagine things.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Are you gonna fess up too?” Agatha snarks, just hoping Rio will meet her outside of her comfort zone.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “If you want me to, sure,” she says. “But we were talking about you. What things about foreplay do you like?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha finds a spot on the horizon to stare at while she talks.
     <br/>
     “I like… the chase. The anticipation, I guess? Not knowing what’s about to happen yet, but knowing where it will end.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “And physically?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Physically, I– I do most of the touching; the– let’s call it the warming up. And if I feel like I want to be touched, I can do it myself. Sometimes, I ask for it.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Do you like to be on top?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha is alarmed by the boldness at first, but somewhere, something inside her is waking up again. She has never gone into detail about this with someone before, and Rio’s apparent lack of judgement makes it feel exciting instead of humiliating. She decides to lean into it, and meets Rio’s gaze head on.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yes.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Do you want to be in control?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yes.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Have you ever tried it the other way around?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Didn’t like it.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio leans forward, more and more invested. “Gotcha. What else don’t you like?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What I don’t like… Hm. Well– You’re going to laugh: I’m not a fan of penetration. But I totally understand it’s a part of what–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio raises up a hand to interrupt. “Stop,” she says sternly. “You don’t like penetration. Full stop. No ‘but’. You don’t need an excuse, no need to justify.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No, I mean– I
     <em>
      know
     </em>
     it’s an important part of straight sex. So I try to make it enjoyable for myself. Just like I’m sure they do things they don’t necessarily like to me sometimes. Isn’t that what you’re supposed to do for a partner? Make
     <em>
      each other
     </em>
     feel good?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Nope.” Rio sounds unyielding. Upon Agatha’s questioning look, she continues: “Literally, just no. That’s not how things are supposed to work. Not in my book, anyway. Either both parties agree and enjoy it, or it doesn’t happen. No matter how badly someone wants something. Making someone feel good only works if it makes
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     feel good, too.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha looks at her like she just slapped her in the face. Rio’s words hit her right in her chest– she swallows a few times to keep the emotion down. Why does this make her feel so– heard? Understood? Valid?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Ever heard the phrase
     <em>
      ‘consent is sexy’?”
     </em>
     Rio asks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I guess, yeah.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “That goes way deeper than just– assuming someone likes something. And it’s really, really powerful. Consent is not just a nice thing to have. It
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     sexy. Enthusiastic consent– out of this fucking world.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There’s a passion in Rio’s demeanor that leaves Agatha wanting to know more, so she fuels the discussion.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I never said I did something without my consent. I just said I’m not a fan of it.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio chuckles dryly. “I truly hope that one day, you’ll allow me to show you what the difference is.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Why not do it now?” Agatha teases her. Rio seems to consider it for a moment, then licks her bottom lip and nods.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Sure. Yeah. Okay.” She shifts her body into a more comfortable position, her brain working overtime.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Alright. I’ve got something. Example one. Let’s pretend you ask me to kiss you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha grins. “Fine. I’ll humour you.
     <em>
      Please kiss me
     </em>
     .”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Hmm. I’m not exactly a fan of kissing, but I’ll do
     <em>
      anything
     </em>
     to make you feel good,” Rio acts in a low, husky, and frankly comedic
     <em>
      ,
     </em>
     voice. Both of them snicker at her performance.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Shaking it off, Rio says: “Okay. Keep that one in mind, yeah? Up next, example two. Ask me again.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Rio,
     <em>
      please kiss me
     </em>
     ?"
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But this time, Rio’s eyes grow darker and she chuckles.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Sweetheart, you really have no idea
     <em>
      how fucking badly
     </em>
     I want to kiss you. The idea of your lips on mine drives me wild. I want it. I want your mouth. Right. Fucking. Now
     <em>
      .”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Agatha’s blood drains from her face to drop down to her core, which instantly fires up. She knows it’s supposed to be an act, but fuck… there’s no doubt about it:
     <em>
      that was--
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     “See my point?
     <em>
      Enthusiastic
     </em>
     <em>
      consent is sexy.”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     “I– yeah, I guess I see what you mean,” Agatha murmurs, her voice hoarse. She clears her throat to feign casualness, but when she squeezes her thighs together, she realizes how turned on she is. And she bets Rio knows it too.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Your turn,” Agatha quickly fires. “What do you like?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio smiles knowingly, warning Agatha she should know what she signs up for. When Agatha spurs her on with a lifted eyebrow, she shifts her body again, sprawling her legs out on the seat.
     <br/>
     “I like the anticipation too,” Rio says, nodding her head at Agatha. While she speaks, she lets herself float, getting carried away by her own fantasy.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “But what I like most… is just the act of worshipping another body. The feeling I get when a woman surrenders herself to pleasure, trusting me to give it to her– That’s just unmatched. Makes me feel invincible.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Weirdly enough, Rio’s words don’t exactly extinguish the raging wildfire between Agatha’s legs. And she’s not even done yet,
     <em>
      of fucking course she’s not done yet.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     “But I enjoy being touched too. I can be so sensitive sometimes; when you play it right. I revel in the amount of
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     and
     <em>
      need
     </em>
     I can feel in my body. I like getting desperate for the touch of a hand, fingers, a mouth… Because when it’s finally given to me, it’s fucking fireworks, Agatha.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     During the last few words, she suddenly sits up and meets Agatha’s gaze again. Her pupils are blown, and her shallow breathing matches Agatha’s. Oh, this is definitely doing something for Rio too.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “One more thing,” Rio whispers. “I also like to be watched.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha’s lips part and she can only stare, helplessly drawn to this beautiful woman, unable to move or make a sound.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Would you like me to show you where I like to be touched?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And Agatha just nods.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Is that a yes?”
     <br/>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      “Yes.”
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But when Rio sneakily reaches out to press the button that activates the jets, she’s taken aback. Was this the end of their conversation? This is where Rio wanted to leave them at?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As the jacuzzi loudly fires up again, the water bubbling up, Agatha’s eyes linger on the woman in front of her who languidly stretches out like she doesn’t have a care in the world.
     <br/>
     Agatha decides she probably must be trying to calm herself down after their heated conversation. Not a bad idea– Agatha should probably get herself back together too.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     However, with Rio having her eyes closed, it gives her the opportunity to closely study her face; the blush that’s not just on her cheeks, but also on her forehead and neck. The wet strands of her that frame her face, occasionally leaving droplets behind on her skin. Her full lips, slowly parting in full relaxation. The slight twitch in her brow, which–
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Wait. That twitch doesn’t seem relaxed at all, it looks more like she’s… straining?
     <br/>
     Agatha’s eyes drift down to Rio’s chest, which shows signs of uneven breathing, and even further down– she freezes. Fuck. Is Rio
     <em>
      … getting off?
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     She can’t quite see anything that’s happening beneath the surface because of the jets, but it almost looks like–
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Oh.
     <em>
      Oh my god.
     </em>
     The fucking jets.
     <br/>
     Rio has positioned herself in a way the stream hits her just right. And from the look of it, it doesn’t only feel good, but the sensation seems to be building gradually.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When realization sets in, the pulsating of her own clit becomes almost unbearable. Watching Rio slowly lose herself to the stimulation; it makes Agatha almost come on the spot.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     For a moment, there’s nothing she can do but watch. With her eyes still closed, Rio’s lips part even wider, her jaw falling open now, and her brows furrow in ecstasy.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But when her eyes fly open and she immediately takes Agatha in to see if she’s still in the game, her body starts twitching. Her mouth curves into a lazy smile when she notices Agatha’s lustful stare, and she tilts her head back, looking at her with hooded eyes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha wants, no,
     <em>
      needs
     </em>
     to know what Rio is feeling. Before she can help it, she feels herself shift around to find one of the vertical jets in the seat, and positions herself over it. The stream is powerful; it hits her relentlessly, and she can’t stop her body from jerking away. She looks back at Rio, silently asking ‘
     <em>
      how the fuck is this not too much?’,
     </em>
     but she’s met with an encouraging nod and she tries again. Slowly, this time.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She can barely contain the moan that leaves her mouth when she finds the right angle. Luckily, the noise of the jacuzzi is loud enough to not carry the sound over.
     <br/>
     Her eyes roll back for a moment, before she locks eyes with Rio again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      This is probably the hottest thing I’ve ever done,
     </em>
     she thinks while both of them look at each other, climbing higher and higher. She sees Rio occasionally convulse, her face contorting right after, and the knowledge of
     <em>
      why
     </em>
     that is happening keeps adding to the sparks flying through her own body.
     <br/>
     She tries to keep her own sighs and gasps down while enjoying the show, but her body is very clear in what it wants; release.
     <br/>
     And while her clit gets a delicious amount of stimulation through the fabric of her bathing suit like this, it’s not enough. She knows what Rio would have to say about that:
     <em>
      ‘what are you gonna do about it?’
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So encouraged by her own needs and Rio’s wanting eyes, her hand slips between her own legs. She pulls the fabric to the side with her index finger, removing the restricting layer.
     <br/>
     Rio’s eyes follow her moving arm down, eyes wide, but knowing that she isn’t able to see what’s going on beneath the surface, causes Agatha to feel another rippling wave of pleasure. And seeing what it does to Rio, she feels so fucking powerful.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Still, she needs more, so she spreads her legs wider and lets her fingers trail to a spot right above her pubic bone, pulling the skin up and exposing more of her clit to the jet.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      And that’s it.
     </em>
     It hits her exactly right like this, and it doesn’t take long before she starts building towards her peak. Rio clearly isn’t far off either; she can tell she’s mouthing something unintelligible, gasping for air. Watching Rio suck in her lip makes her desperate to hear her moaning, but the water is too loud.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She bites down on her own lip too when she feels her orgasm approaching, throwing her head back and feeling her muscles tense up as she get close, closer,
     <em>
      closer–
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     And she implodes. She tears her eyes away and almost doubles over in her attempt to contain the shaking of her body, keeping herself from trashing. Her nerves are on fire, but it’s
     <em>
      delicious.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Breathing fast and heavily, she looks back up at Rio, who looks like she is rapidly approaching her orgasm too. She watches her tremble, squeezing her eyes shut– until she violently jerks away from the stream, too sensitive to stay there.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The jets die down a few seconds later, and the only audible sound for minutes is their ragged breathing. As they find each other’s gaze once again, Agatha tries no not think about
     <em>
      what the fuck that was.
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio seems to come back to her senses before Agatha, and wastes no time getting up and out of the tub. Agatha follows her dripping body like a hawk as she wraps a towel around herself, and walks over to Agatha’s side.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She comes to a halt behind her and leans in over her shoulder, lips brushing against her ear.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Looks like you made your own gateway,” she whispers hotly. It makes Agatha shiver, and despite the heat she’d just felt, her skin is covered in goosebumps.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Good girl, Agatha.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And that’s when Agatha fucking
     <em>
      gets it.
     </em>

     From that night on, being in Rio’s near vicinity is damn near torturous. And not just when taking in her flowy skirt during breakfast, or when she unguardedly applies her sunscreen in the afternoon, but even when she spends an entire day locked up in her hotel room because of work, and Agatha barely catches any glimpse of her for the entire day.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And it’s not that Rio’s not aware of it. She seems to have taken up casually touching Agatha as a hobby: putting a hand on her arm whenever she asks her something, placing her palm on the small of her back when they pass each other, leaning into her when she laughs. Even lightly stroking her knee under the table when they all share a meal is not beneath her.
     <br/>
     Every time something like this happens, Agatha feels like she might as well have thrown a lit match into a gas tank.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     At some point, Agatha decides to fight fire with fire. She makes sure to whisper innocent little things in Rio’s ear when they happen to cross paths, like ‘the croissants at breakfast were really good’, ‘the weather is nice today’, or ‘my hand hurts from masturbating so often because I keep picturing you having an orgasm’.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So yes, this is torture– the best kind of torture. And as neither woman is planning on tapping out soon, they’ve made it their secret little game to get under each other’s skin as often as possible.
     <br/>
     This goes exceptionally well when the four of them spend an afternoon at the beach, which is at a walkable distance from the hotel, surrounded by caves and rock formations.
     <br/>
     While they still have to be careful around Jen and Alice, they nearly have free rein as the soon-to-be-married couple is so taken up with each other. Additionally, both Agatha and Rio are highly skilled at making their sexually charged comments sound like they still want to rip each other’s head off, like old times.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So when the four of them sprawl out on their beach towels and Agatha accidentally kicks up a load of sand which lands on Rio’s stomach, no one bats an eye when she remarks that
     <em>
      that’s what Rio gets for being too close and ruining her view.
     </em>
     <br/>
     And when they’re all up to their waists in the sea and Rio makes Agatha trip, it’s totally accepted behavior when she catches her and brags about
     <em>
      how lucky she should count herself to have such a handsome and observant lifeguard as a friend.
     </em>
     <br/>
     The fact that Rio’s little stunt ends in them trying to pull each other underwater, which makes Jen and Alice retreat to their towels to not get caught in the crossfire, is also
     <em>
      very much in character for them.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <br/>
     It only takes a few minutes longer for Jen and Alice to announce they’re going to go back to the hotel
     <em>
      ‘to go over their vows
     </em>
     ’, which earns them a loud whistle from Rio and a “
     <em>
      suuuuuure”
     </em>
     from Agatha.
     <em>
      <br/>
      <br/>
     </em>
     It’s no surprise that, shortly after their friends leave, Agatha finds herself pushing Rio up against a wall of one of the caves on the beach, their hungry lips sealed against each other’s.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Agatha,” Rio sighs into her mouth, letting her hands roam over Agatha’s teal one piece that puts her thighs on great display. “Shit, you’re gonna kill me before the wedding.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Don’t you dare die on me this week,” Agatha growls, tearing her lips away from Rio’s to press hot, open mouthed kisses against her already wet and salty neck. This makes Rio bite her lip to stifle a groan, and she digs her fingers into the flesh of Agatha’s ass, where it peeks out from under her swimsuit.
     <br/>
     “--because I’m not gonna direct the reception by myself.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh, but it’s fine with you if I pass away after the party?” Rio asks, trailing one hand up towards Agatha’s neck.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah, don’t care,” Agatha lies, nipping at Rio’s ear lobe. She’s about to soothe it by swiping her tongue over the spot, but Rio’s hand slides into her hair and she tugs firmly.
     <br/>
     In addition to her body weight and the hand that’s still on Agatha’s ass, she now has enough leverage to flip their positions, pushing Agatha’s back roughly against the wall.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha lets out a surprised ‘
     <em>
      ah!’,
     </em>
     but is immediately silenced by Rio’s mouth on hers. Rio slides her tongue in and curls it along the roof of her mouth, making Agatha whimper.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t think you can live without me yet; we have a few lessons left,” Rio whispers in between kisses.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So teach me,” Agatha breathes against her lips.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio smiles and pulls away to trail a line of kisses along her jaw, “Alright,” she says, resting her hands on Agatha’s hips. “Today’s lesson: how does a woman you’re making out with, tell you that she wants more?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Mm, don’t know,” Agatha murmurs, her mind hazy. She turns her head to steal a kiss, but Rio leans back, smirking.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     That smirk turns into a predatory grin when she places her foot in between Agatha’s legs, kicking them apart. Then, she leans forward again, catching her lips in a searing kiss, as she lifts her bare knee up to press against Agatha’s core.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When Rio’s knee hits her right between her thighs, she lets out a
     <em>
      filthy
     </em>
     moan– she’s sure she has never made that sound before. For a moment, she’s worried she might’ve scared Rio off– but the opposite turns out to be true when she feels Rio smile against her lips, the kiss intensifying, as she presses her knee up even more firmly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The contact sends a jolt of electricity through Agatha’s entire system and it feels
     <em>
      good.
     </em>
     The thin layer of her swimsuit is the only thing that separates the skin of Rio’s leg from her own pussy– and suddenly it’s the only thing she can think about. It’s scary, it’s new, but it’s positively thrilling.
     <br/>
     The first time she rolls her hips down on Rio’s knee, it’s purely a reflex. But when she feels a strong wave of pleasure crash through her body and her eyes automatically roll back, she grabs Rio’s face to suck at her lips and tongue with even more fervor– and she grinds down again. And again.
     <em>
      And again.
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      Fuuuuck,”
     </em>
     Agatha groans, losing all composure as her body completely takes over. It’s like she has no say in this at all– her body takes what it wants. What it apparently has been wanting for a long, long time.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But of course, Rio notices, and she lowers her leg. At Agatha’s needy whine, she cups her cheek with her hand, and whispers: “That’s it for today’s lesson.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Rio…” Agatha pouts, pulling her in by the waist. Instead of giving into the invitation, Rio starts peppering kisses all over her face.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You still haven’t told me you’re ready,” she whispers against her skin. “And I doubt you are. I only want you when
     <em>
      all of you
     </em>
     is ready, Agatha.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha growls something unintelligible, and Rio chuckles as she brushes her thumb over her bottom lip. Agatha tries to bite it, and she quickly pulls away.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “We’re not going to do something you might regret later because your body has hit second puberty before your mind has caught up,” she explains sweetly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Second puberty?” Agatha frowns incredulously. “What a load of bullshit. I’m about to hit menopause in a few years, as everybody and their dog likes to remind me.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Stroking her cheek with a knuckle, Rio says: “What do you think will happen to your body when it realizes there’s a whole new world to explore? New bodies, new dynamics, new actions, needs, preferences… It’s all been locked away for decades, and suddenly– everything becomes accessible. And as opposed to teenage puberty: it happens all at once. Your hormones are about to go through the roof.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha huffs. “You think pretty highly of yourself, don’t you?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah I do, but that’s not the point.” Rio grins and leans in for a soft kiss. “I think pretty highly of
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     . I have faith your body will try to give you everything you’ve been missing. Even if it’s messy and unbalanced– and delicious. But hey, I will be here if you need to blow off some steam, and I will try not to complain about it.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha weakly punches her in the stomach. “And they say chivalry is dead.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     Back at the hotel, Agatha is forced to keep checking in with herself. She now realizes that what Rio had said about second puberty might’ve been true for a couple of days already; there are very few moments during the day when her mind
     <em>
      doesn’t
     </em>
     drift to sex, kissing, or any other kind of physical contact. She tries to escape it by going for a swim, trying to get lost in her book, or hitting the hotel gym on the ground floor; but nothing stops the lustful fire that lies in wait in her stomach.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She avoids going to her room during the day, because she really doesn’t want to touch herself
     <em>
      again
     </em>
     . She avoids Rio, too– not that it helps, because the second they run into each other anyway, Agatha gets relentlessly distracted by one of their heated memories.
     <br/>
     God, she knows it’s going to happen at some point, and she truly respects Rio for being so careful with her, but the anticipation is getting so bad that Agatha keeps setting the bar higher and higher for herself. She’s imagined it multiple times: how she wants to tell Rio she’s ready, how she wants to show her that she can take initiative, how she will kiss her and throw her on the bed. In other scenarios, Rio is doing the throwing, but her imagination stops when Rio takes off her clothes; just because she has no idea how to picture her naked. She has seen and studied her body at every opportunity she’d gotten, so she knows what every little piece of skin looks like, except for the areas on her body that have always been covered by clothes– or hands, as Rio had been topless at the strip club, but Agatha had only seen her with her nipples covered.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     While weeks, or even days ago, Agatha would’ve just wondered what they would look and feel like, now it’s not just casual curiosity anymore. She
     <em>
      needs
     </em>
     to know, almost like her body isn’t giving her another option:
     <em>
      act on it, or be haunted by imagining you act on it.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <br/>
     She’s having a hard time giving in to the ogling when Rio is actually sunbathing by the pool, –all the way on the other side from where Agatha is–because at some point she has started to compare herself to the countless straight males who can’t think of anything else but to touch and have sex with a woman. Every comment she wants to make, every attempt at flirtation, or just letting her know that she appreciates the view– it sounds wrong in her mind when she pictures it being a man who says it. She wants to be better than that. She is better than that.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Her reservations about desirably staring and boldly flirting get thrown out the window when Rio, upon passing her on the way to the bar, asks her if she can
     <em>
      please stop being so attractive, as she’s disturbing public order with that bikini.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Agatha realizes that any man would’ve gotten punched in the face after saying something like that– but when Rio does it, she instantly feels herself getting wet and the muscles in her lower stomach contract. Interesting. So maybe she can get away with a lot more than she thinks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     At the same time, these comparisons to men make her very much aware of the fact that her mind has never felt this occupied by lust before when it comes to her straight sexual history. Is it because this is new territory? Or because the idea of being with a woman is really that much more exciting?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The universe definitely doesn’t fuck around when it comes to Agatha, which is why the irony is not lost on her when Rio returns to her sun bed, drink in hand, and the bed next to her gets occupied by a pretty handsome man in his forties. She can tell he’s handsome because of his strong jaw, smooth skin, dark stubble and a nice, toned body– and yet, it does nothing to her. How could it, when right next to him is the most sexy, intelligent, and caring woman ever? So confident in her own body, her yellow string bikini barely covering the necessities, her legs sprawled out in front of her– goddamn, that leg that was pressed up against her cunt a couple of days ago…
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha sits up in her chair. She takes her sunglasses off and looks over to the guy once more: nothing. Not even when her eyes land on the bulge in his swim shorts.
     <br/>
     Her eyes flick back to Rio– she feels herself getting light headed, her heart rate goes up, the need to touch and squeeze and caress
     <em>
      that perfect, flawless skin
     </em>
     becomes almost unbearable.
     <br/>
     Back to the guy– and her fire quickly sizzles out, until there’s just some smoldering ashes left.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      What the fuck has she been doing?
     </em>
     She scolds herself as she completely blocks him out to take in everything Rio is putting on display. Even from this distance, she can feel the effect of the magnetic pull Rio has on her. The softness of her –
     <em>
      how soft would she be under that bikini?
     </em>
     -- and the way her quirky personality just challenges Agatha in all the right ways.
     <br/>
     The more she thinks about it, the more logical it feels. Of course she’s into her. Of course it makes sense to want her. What starts making less and less sense, is what Agatha is waiting for. She could have her, right now, and allow herself to finally have the experience she’s been missing out on. Finally drawing out the memories of mediocre sex–
     <em>
      would this actually be better than what she’s used to?
     </em>
     -- and finally knowing what it will feel like to make her moan, make her feel good, make her completely come undone.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Just like that, Agatha can’t think of a single reason to wait anymore.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She grabs her phone, pulls up Rio’s message thread, and sends her a text: just two words that might be about to change her life.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      I’m ready.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She watches from a distance as Rio feels around for her buzzing phone, finds it under a towel, and lays back on the sun bed, holding her it up above her face. She unlocks it and Agatha snickers as she nearly drops the phone, catching it just before it hits her in the chin, and shooting up like an arrow fired from a bow.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio looks around, finds Agatha’s gaze, and slides her own sunglasses up in her hair while her jaw slowly drops. She smoothly raises an eyebrow, almost like she wants confirmation.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha smirks, and types another message while Rio keeps watching her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      I want you.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Rio looks down as her phone buzzes again, and this time Agatha catches her slamming her thighs together, nervously looking around to see if anyone notices whatever those texts are doing to her. She grips the edge of the bed with her left hand, looks down on her phone again and starts typing with the right, but then decides against it and she stands up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha feels her heart hammer inside her chest as Rio strides up to her. When she’s close enough for them to speak, neither woman says anything. Rio just stands there, looking Agatha up and down with a hungry expression in her eyes.
     <br/>
     Eventually, she sits down on the far end of Agatha’s sun bed, leaning back on her hands, maintaining eye contact.
     <br/>
     At first, Agatha finds it frustrating, the way she just sits herself down without saying anything. But then she realizes what Rio’s doing: she’s trying to find any reservations, any sense of pressure or impatience, any hesitation in Agatha’s eyes.
     <br/>
     That’s when Agatha shifts her own expression from expectant to determined. She narrows her eyes, curves one side of her mouth up, and gives her a miniscule nod.
     <br/>
     Holding her breath while she waits for a response, she watches Rio fight her own battles in her eyes– until she returns both the smile and the nod. Agatha breathes out shakily.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Dinner first,” Rio whispers, reaching out to playfully tickle Agatha’s ankle and calf with her fingers, making her leg twitch. “After dinner, go to your room. I’ll give us 20 minutes to freshen up. And then I’ll come to your room.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Somehow, even now Rio’s words go straight to her core. She shivers and has no control over the soft whimper that leaves her mouth. Would it be inappropriate to just… attack her here, rip off that skimpy bikini, and kiss every inch of her skin?
     <em>
      Mmmaybe.
     </em>
     <br/>
     Instead, she presses her lips together, and then she nods again. Rio smiles, gets up, and walks back to her own sun bed, giving Agatha a perfect view of her full, round ass that she kind of wants to set her teeth in.
     <br/>
     Oh god. Rio is gonna come to her room. And she’s gonna do things to her. If she plays her cards right and Rio makes good on her promise, she’s about to get her brains fucked out.
    </p>
    <p>
     But before dinner, she’s gonna need an ice cold shower first.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If she thinks dinners with the four of them have been difficult before, this one almost makes her want to cry– even when Rio is keeping her taunting comments to a minimum.
     <br/>
     Agatha’s been mindlessly pushing her meal around on her plate, until Jen asks her if she’s okay.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, just not very hungry,” she shrugs. “I’m sure it’s the heat.”
    </p>
    <p>
     When she looks up, she is met with a reprimanding shake of Rio’s head.
     <br/>
     “Eat,” she mouths, and Agatha can’t even stop herself from getting turned on by that subtle command.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Or is your mind somewhere else?” Jen inquires innocently. “Or with someone else?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah, any hot Mexicans in your wedding rolodex?” Alice pipes up. “You know it’s tradition for the bridesmaids to get laid.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This time, Agatha forcefully stabs her salad and shoves a large amount of food into her mouth. “No hot Mexicans on my radar,” she replies while chewing. “Way too busy making everything perfect for you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Don’t be celibate on our account,” Jen huffs. “God knows it’ll be a better day for
     <em>
      everyone
     </em>
     if you find someone to bang.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And after a few more highly uncalled for comments on Agatha’s sex life and mood, she comes pretty fucking close to blowing the whole thing off. The only thing that saves the wedding in that moment, unbeknownst to the brides-to-be, is the fact that Agatha’s mind is already elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     She excuses herself pretty soon after finishing dinner, buying herself more time until Rio will be knocking at her door. She tidies up her room –she’s not messy, it’s
     <em>
      organized chaos
     </em>
     – and puts Scratchy in his playpen in the bathroom, showering his little head with kisses first.
    </p>
    <p>
     She spends the remainder of the time looking at herself in the mirror from different angles, which is not doing anything to help calm down her nerves, but it does satisfy her need for control. She smiles at herself when she notices the light tan she’d gotten over the past week, making her skin radiate. Her semi-permanently flushed cheeks and her smile lines which seem to have gotten a little deeper, make her study herself better. She looks different. Happy. Giddy. And despite her deeper wrinkles: younger.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Trying to choose between putting her hair up or leaving it down, she eventually settles on up, freeing the access to her neck. Even though she’s wearing a light off-shoulder sundress, she’s showing a lot of skin. It’s a short dress; it reaches down just below the swell of her ass when she’s standing up. And when she’s not standing up– well, she’s sure Rio won’t mind.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Just when she’s finished brushing her teeth, there’s a knock on the door. Her heart starts pounding but she answers it quickly. A sense of relief washes over her when she’s greeted by Rio carrying two glasses of what looks like whiskey.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh thank god,” Agatha sighs, plucking one glass from Rio’s hand and taking a sip right away. She makes a face– toothpaste and whiskey are apparently an abominable combination.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Hey Rio, nice to see you Rio, how kind of you to bring drinks Rio,” the woman standing outside her door playfully remarks. “Do you think you’re gonna invite me in at some point, or are you planning on sharing this with el señor?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha pretends to give it some thought. “You’re lucky he’s underage,” she eventually says, stepping aside to let Rio in. When she enters, she pointedly clinks her glass against Agatha’s, before walking further in the room.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha shuts the door and leans back against it. She watches Rio, who wears a simple black tshirt dress, taking in her room and the variety of items on the vanity.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Where is he anyway?” Rio asks, turning on her heel. Agatha nods at the bathroom door.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “He’s very fond of his privacy,” she says.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “As he should be.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha exhales slowly, manually trying to expel some tension. Within two strides, Rio is back right in front of her, smiling reassuringly. Without breaking eye contact, Rio sips her drink. Agatha copies her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Your texts have been everything I could think about today, but I still like to hear you actually say it,” Rio murmurs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha tilts her head up in teasing defiance.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Which one?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Both of them.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha’s heart rate picks up again, she feels it in her throat and the artery in her neck. This is what they’re both good at, what they will exploit until one of them falters.
     <em>
      Or succumbs to the gay panic,
     </em>
     she muses. And by now, she knows how to trigger Rio’s.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah, but which one did you like better? The one where I told you I was ready to have sex with you? Or the one where I told you that I wanted you?”
     <br/>
     Rio clearly tries to hide the hitch in her breath, but Agatha notices anyway.
     <br/>
     “Just so we stay clear from any confusion,” she adds with a smirk.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio rolls her tongue around in her mouth, impressed by Agatha’s statement.
     <br/>
     “I’m glad you remembered how much I value healthy communication,” she says in a low voice, sipping her drink again. While she licks a stray drop of whiskey off her bottom lip, her eyes briefly flick towards Agatha’s mouth. Agatha promises herself that she’ll be the one licking up any droplets when that happens again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     While Rio’s tone has been playful, she makes sure Agatha knows there’s an honest truth behind it.
     <br/>
     “If we’re doing this,” she says, letting her eyes skim over Agatha’s face for any sign of reservation, “can I trust you to tell me whenever you want to stop? Or take a break? Or if you want something specific?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha automatically wants to reply without thinking, but she stops herself and takes a moment to really consider the request. Can Rio trust her to do that? Does she trust Rio enough to be that honest?
     <br/>
     She thinks back to the countless moments of shared vulnerability between the two of them. The way her annoyance has turned into admiration, just because of what a thoughtful person Rio is. Sharing stories, good and bad, while Rio was thousands of miles away. And while Rio still has the ability to drive her insane with her endless taunting, she’s helplessly attracted to her. What matters even more in this moment however, is that on top of her physical attraction and interest, she considers Rio to be a friend too. And she wouldn’t be friends with people she doesn’t trust.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “When,” Agatha corrects her. At Rio’s questioning look, she clarifies: “
     <em>
      When
     </em>
     we’re going to do this. Not if. I promise to be honest, Rio. I trust you. You and all your infuriating little quirks.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio answers her promise with an endeared smile, leaning in to press a kiss to the apple of her cheek.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Do
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     ?” Agatha whispers when Rio’s face is still next to hers. “Do you trust me? And promise me to be honest about what you want?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She needs to ask her this, she needs the playing field to be equal. Rio seems to understand that.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I promise to be honest, and I promise to try everything within my power to make both of us feel good,” she answers quietly in her ear. Agatha shivers. Leaning back, Rio adds: “if you do get uncomfortable at some point, or you can’t speak for whatever reason, let’s agree you tap me three times. We’ll stop immediately.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     At that, Agatha scrunches her face and chuckles. “I didn’t know you were gonna bring your kinks into this.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “There’s nothing kinky about wanting to be careful and safe, Agatha,” Rio says with a smile, but her tone is genuine. “And like I said before– I’m not bringing up my kinks with you in the foreseeable future anyway.” Her smile turns into a grin.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And even though she didn’t
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     Rio to, she can’t help but feel a little rejected. “Why not?” she asks defensively. “Don’t think I can handle it? I may have never slept with a woman before, but I’m not a virgin or a prude.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio breathes out and shakes her head, leaning in to kiss Agatha again. This time, she puts her lips on her temple, murmuring: “Not everything is about you, mi pequeña bola de fuego. There are some things I need more time for because they make
     <em>
      me
     </em>
     vulnerable.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha presses her lips together in guilt. She hasn’t considered that. “Sorry.”
     <br/>
     She doesn’t know what else to say, so she takes another sip of her whiskey. The burning sensation of the alcohol in her throat makes her feel present again. Then she remembers what else Rio said.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Wait– what did you call me?” she asks suspiciously.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio smirks and places kisses from her temple down to her jaw, shifting her direction towards her ear, where she softly nips at the shell. “You can be a bit of a hothead, Agatha.”
     <br/>
     The kisses continue, this time just below her ear– finding a spot that makes her jump.
     <br/>
     “Mi bola de fuego. My fireball.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’ll show you a fucking fireball,” Agatha grumbles softly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio laughs, and latches onto the spot that makes Agatha squirm again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No me amenaces con pasar un buen rato.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha whimpers, and not just because of where Rio’s lips are. And while she normally admires Rio’s perceptiveness, she wants to curse it now.
     <br/>
     With a pleased look on her face, she steps back, taking Agatha’s glass from her hand and turning to the vanity. She takes one last sip of her own whiskey before placing both glasses down and walking back to Agatha, who's back is still against the door. She doesn’t press herself up against her, but extends a hand for Agatha to take.
     <br/>
     When she does, she reels her in with a surprising amount of strength, making their bodies collide in the middle of the room. Rio catches her by the hips and wastes no time leaning in to kiss Agatha on the mouth.
     <br/>
     Immediately, Agatha feels something cold and wet against her lips. When she parts them in surprise, she realizes Rio is letting her taste some of the whiskey in her mouth. Oh, gross–
     <br/>
     No, wait.
     <em>
      Fuck,
     </em>
     she thinks.
     <em>
      This is kind of hot.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      “
     </em>
     Tengo suerte de que seas tan malo ocultando lo que te excita,” Rio says in a gravelly voice, fingers digging into Agatha’s hips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You need to shut the fuck up,” Agatha counters brightly, in between licking the remnants of the alcohol from Rio’s lips. Rio playfully tries to catch her tongue between her lips every time it peeks out.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No, si te hace tener más hambre de mí.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Rio, I swear to god, I will–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What?” Rio teases her. “What do you want?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha really just wants to keep kissing her, but she can only stare at her lips.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Come on, sweetheart. You promised to tell me,” Rio continues, lifting Agatha’s chin up. When they make eye contact again, an inviting grin is waiting for her. The desire in Rio’s eyes makes it so much easier to say what she wants.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Kiss me,” Agatha sighs, feeling a sense of relief wash over her when Rio immediately complies. They crash into each other with their lips already parted, tongues exploring the inside of each other's mouth.
     <br/>
     She can’t get over how Rio’s kisses wind her up so much every time– this woman has a seriously skilled tongue. That thought makes Agatha moan into the kiss, a feeling of pride washing over her because she, and no one else, gets to kiss Rio in this moment.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As the kiss gets more heated, they press their bodies more and more into each other, desperate for physical contact. Upon a particularly well-aimed bucking of Rio’s hips, Agatha gasps, but quickly uses the distraction to put her foot between Rio’s legs. With her hands tangled in her hair, she pushes her leg up, applying pressure to Rio’s groin with her thigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Oh– shit,”
     </em>
     Rio moans, and she seems to reflexively rock back on the thigh between her legs. “Fuck, I shouldn’t have taught you that,” she mumbles before diving back into the kiss.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The scene sets Agatha off like fireworks; having this effect on Rio, eliciting these sounds and reactions from her, is something she won’t grow tired of anytime soon. On the contrary: when she starts feeling a damp heat on her thigh, she wants to do more.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But before she can calculate how to do that, one of Rio’s hands starts slowly trailing upward past her stomach, coming to a stop on her ribs. When Agatha realizes what she’s about to do, even though the hand is still over her dress, a rush of heat spikes through her body, quickening her breath in anticipation.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio breaks their kiss, but stays close. “May I touch you here?” she asks softly, tentatively stroking the underside of her breast with a finger.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yes,” Agatha inhales, nodding severely. She’s about to combust under the tension.
     <em>
      “Please.”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Rio’s hand continues its journey upward, carefully cupping the entire breast in her palm. Agatha tries to suppress a hiss when she feels her nipple harden through the fabric.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Damn, Agatha,” Rio drawls, licking her own lips. “No bra? Couldn’t you go easy on me?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Her playful tone relieves some of the tension, and Agatha relaxes into the touch. As Rio gently starts massaging, Agatha replies: “Don’t try to convince me you hadn't noticed that.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio shakes her head and leans forward, kissing Agatha’s neck on the opposite side of where her hand is working her breast.
     <br/>
     “You sound so surprised that I haven’t been looking at your boobs yet,” she remarks, softly sucking at Agatha’s pulse point. The palm of the hand on her breast starts rubbing against the pebbled nipple.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha throws her head back as the sensation sends sparks throughout her entire upper body. “You’re a criminal,” she hisses. “You’re a lying motherfucking criminal.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Mm, you got me,” Rio admits, switching sides, cupping and squeezing the neglected breast. But instead of pushing her palm against the nipple, this time she softly pinches it through the fabric. Agatha lets out a mewl that embarrasses her immediately, until she notices it invigorates Rio’s caresses. The pinching turns into pulling, and Agatha presses her lips together to not make any more noise. Instead, she breathes heavily through her nose.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You feel incredible,” Rio says, the sound muffled against Agatha’s neck. “I wonder what you feel like under this damn dress…”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Are you hinting at something?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Not at all.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Rio?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Hmm?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I want to touch you first.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio looks up, meeting Agatha’s gaze at eye level. The brown of her eyes has nearly turned into black, her chest heaving.
     <br/>
     “Yeah,” she breathes, processing what Agatha is asking. “Yeah, of course.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She drops her hand back to Agatha’s hip, waiting for her to take or ask what she wants. But Agatha sucks in her own bottom lip, suddenly paralyzed– she has no idea how to do this, where to start.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio examines her face, intensively maintaining eye contact, as to not lose Agatha to her own thoughts. “Do you need–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      “Teach me,”
     </em>
     Agatha whispers breathlessly. “Tell me what you like, how to touch you."
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio nods, thinks about it for a second, and takes Agatha by the hand to guide her to the bed. She makes her sit down on the edge, stands in front of her, and lifts her own dress up a little to be able to straddle her. As she sits down on Agatha’s lap, knees on both sides of her, she cups her face to ask if this is okay.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yes,” Agatha answers, feeling grounded by Rio’s weight on her. She places her hands on her thighs, squeezing softly. It makes Rio rock her hips into Agatha’s, eliciting a breathy chuckle from both of them.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She knows Rio can tell she’s still way too tense, which is why Rio tangles her hands in her hair and leans forward to kiss her. It’s softer now, less hurried, but not any less intimate. Rio kisses her like she’s trying to siphon a sense of calm into Agatha through their connected lips. Agatha giggles into her mouth when she realizes it’s actually working.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     With their lips still connected, Rio places her hands on top of Agatha’s. She slowly lifts them off her thighs, and guides them towards her own breasts. When her hands land where Rio wants them to, Agatha starts squeezing her without prompting.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And you’re calling me out for not wearing a bra?” Agatha mumbles, punishingly nipping at Rio’s lip.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio’s fingers apply more and more pressure to her hands, silently asking her to squeeze harder. She gradually complies, scared to hurt her at first– but when Rio gasps at a particularly firm squeeze, she doesn’t need to think about it anymore and her body takes over. She gives more of herself to Rio; deepening the kiss, strongly massaging her breasts so that she can keep listening to Rio’s gasps and whimpers, and she eventually even starts bucking up her hips every now and then, adding to her own desire. Rio lets go of her hands, sliding them into her own hair for lack of a better place.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When Agatha finally relaxes into it, it feels great, but– she’s still only feeling her up through the fabric. And that just won’t do.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Dropping her hands to the hem of Rio’s dress, she breaks their kiss and looks up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Off?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Through Rio’s clearly turned on demeanor, her smirk returns.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Off, what?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolls her eyes, but doesn’t have enough patience to fight her on this. “May I please take your dress off?” she asks reluctantly, and can’t help but add a mocking “-...
     <em>
      Madam
     </em>
     ?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She doesn’t miss Rio’s sharp intake of breath, but she doesn’t have time to really register it as Rio’s hands drop too and she pulls her dress slowly up over her head, leaving her completely bare on Agatha’s lap, save for her lace thong.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Captivated by the look of Rio’s naked breasts, hardened nipples right in front of her face, she surprises herself when she literally feels herself starting to salivate. And what is there to do but listen to her own body?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Without thinking, she leans forward, capturing one of the nipples with her lips. It’s a new sensation– the nipple feels rough and yet soft in her mouth. It’s delicate, and she’s highly aware of that when she swirls her tongue around it, hearing Rio hum above her.
     <br/>
     Remembering that Rio likes firmer squeezes, she wonders if the same goes for the way she likes her nipples to be treated– and so she softly digs her teeth in and starts pulling.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio swears loudly, rocking her hips down once again. Agatha looks up, concerned she’s overdone it, but Rio looks down on her with an almost feral look in her eyes.
     <br/>
     “Fuck, keep going,” she growls, grabbing Agatha by the back of her head and guiding her back down to her nipple. Agatha smiles into it as she keeps exploring all the different ways she can make Rio twitch and groan; biting, soothing, licking, pinching, squeezing, and occasionally switching sides.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It’s getting harder and harder to ignore the heat that radiates from in between Rio’s legs, even if there’s still a few layers of fabric between them. With Rio grinding down every so often, their clothes are the least distracting thing about feeling Rio’s desire so close to her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha releases the nipple with a
     <em>
      pop
     </em>
     , her lip curving up at the sound, and eventually revelling at the look of both nipples wet and a little red, proudly on Rio’s heaving chest.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Eh– Rio?” she asks, slowly raising her eyes to meet Rio’s. The lingering heat she sees there almost makes her squirm.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I think– I think I’m
     <em>
      really into boobs.
     </em>
     They’re so…
     <em>
      so soft.”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     And Rio laughs, a rich, guttural sound.
     <br/>
     She cups Agatha’s cheek with a hand, leans in close, and says almost sing-songy: “Duh.”
     <br/>
     Then she rolls her eyes and kisses her firmly, as Agatha’s hands fly up to touch Rio’s breasts again. When their lips part, Agatha leans forward, peppering kisses all over her chest.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     While her hands find Rio’s hips again, and later her ass, she starts tentatively squeezing the skin there. Rio combs her fingers through Agatha’s hair, giving her time to explore further.
     <br/>
     But when Agatha finds a good grip and manages to position her upper body just right, she’s able to flip them over, showcasing her strength which Rio likes so much, effectively throwing Rio on her back on the mattress. It elicits a high and uncharacteristic yelp out of her, and she immediately covers her mouth with both hands. As she looks up at Agatha, who now looms over her, both of them start laughing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You told me I could throw you around whenever I wanted,” Agatha smirks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio drops her hands from her mouth and lets them rest on her own breasts.
     <br/>
     “And I still stand by that. Trust me, I’m not complaining.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha softly slaps her hands away, leaning over to suck and play with her nipples again. With Rio on her back, she’s lost the sensation of her bucking hips– but feeling her squirm all over the mattress beneath her is a welcome new experience.
    </p>
    <p>
     Awkwardly positioning her body over Rio’s first, she soon realizes she can still slot her knee between the other woman’s legs, pressing firmly against the hot and damp fabric of her thong. It makes Rio’s hands fly up to Agatha’s shoulders, holding on for dear life.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha watches in awe when she retreats her leg and notices the wet spot on her own thigh. Eyes wide, she reaches out, touching the wetness with her fingers, feeling the stickiness of it. Rio groans.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Am I– doing this to you?” Agatha whispers, still watching her own damp fingers.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No, I’m having a really vivid daydream about Cate Blanchett,” Rio answers, rubbing her thighs together. At Agatha’s raised eyebrow, she groans again. “Yes babe, you’re doing this to me. Fuck.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     From here, Agatha feels stuck again, still full of want and lust but no idea how to proceed. When Rio’s breathing slows down, she registers Agatha’s struggle, and grabs her by the wrist.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Do you want to get an even better feel of what you do to me?” she purrs. And Agatha hesitates for a moment, knowing what this means, knowing she’s about to take a step into new territory. But her entire body tingles in anticipation, yes,
     <em>
      yes,
     </em>
     she wants to know what she does to Rio. And how she can make it even worse. Or better.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Show me,” Agatha nods, letting Rio guide her hand towards her thong.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She briefly places Agatha’s palm on her lower stomach, while her other hand comes down to lift the waistband up. Then she shoves the hand in, lower, lower, through a patch of short, coarse hairs, and finally, to where the wetness is undoubtedly coming from.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha has stopped breathing, overwhelmed by the idea and the sensation of her hand being in Rio’s underwear, touching her wet folds. Rio takes Agatha’s index finger and traces it over her lips, excruciatingly slow. Next, she uses her free hand to spread herself open, swiping Agatha’s finger through her wetness, all the way from her entrance to her clit. The moment she touches the bundle of nerves, Rio shudders, and Agatha finally breathes out.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     That’s when Rio’s patience seems to shatter. She retracts both of her hands as well as Agatha’s, causing Agatha to worry for a moment, but then she pushes the waistband down and lifts her hips up to get rid of it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Off,
     <em>
      off,”
     </em>
     she growls, while fighting the flimsy piece of clothing now tangled up between her ankles.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha tuts disapprovingly.
     <br/>
     “I believe it’s supposed to be: '
     <em>
      may I take my slutty excuse for underwear off, please?’”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Rio has just plucked her thong off her foot and flung it off the bed, when she looks back at Agatha with a dangerous look in her eyes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You’re on thin fucking ice,” she whispers sharply.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Am I?” Agatha replies coyly, thoroughly enjoying her position. She’s sitting back on her heels next to Rio, perfectly located to take her fully naked body in. She truly,
     <em>
      truly
     </em>
     must be a goddess. There is no other explanation.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “If you keep your big mouth up, you’re gonna get yourself in so much trouble,” Rio threatens with a playful undertone, but her words fall dead against Agatha’s smirk. She reaches out a finger and starts tracing a line down from her sternum to her pubic bone.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Interesting. You don’t really seem like you’re in a position to make threats right now,” she remarks coolly, mindfully taking in every inch of skin she touches. She proudly notices the goosebumps that appear under her touch.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Maybe not right now,” Rio reluctantly admits, “but just you fucking wait until you–
     <em>
      ah!”
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha has slipped her finger between Rio’s legs again, continuing the stroking from where they left off when Rio’s underwear was still on. Without Rio’s help this time, she feels around her folds, studying her reactions to every touch, and eventually swiping up from her entrance to her clit again.
     <br/>
     Rio reaches up for a pillow and yanks it down, placing it under her head and squeezing the sides firmly in an attempt to keep her composure somehow. Still, it’s not enough to keep her from releasing an occasional ‘
     <em>
      oh fuck’.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     The whole thing makes Agatha very much aware of her own wetness. It encourages her to keep exploring every spot, every angle, every
     <em>
      nerve
     </em>
     that sets off any kind of reaction; tracing lines and circles, on her clit, lips, or just the inside of her thighs. She examines what kind of touches make her even wetter, which ones make her swear the loudest. She’s irreversibly captivated by this beautiful and intricate body surrendering to her touches, when she hears her name in a soft whimper.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Agatha…” Rio’s lower body squirms as her hands still desperately grip onto the pillow under her head. “I need you to know– that I’m fully supportive of your need for exploration, and– and you should t-take all the time you need– b-but, you need to know– that you’re driving m-me absolutely f-fucking wild with your– f-fingers and I’m extremely close to– to losing my goddamn mind if you– d-don’t start fucking me right n-now.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A wave of heat rushes up to Agatha’s cheeks, throwing her off balance by both the sexiness of Rio’s words, and her own embarrassment for not noticing she’d been teasing her for so long.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh– shit, sorry,” she stammers. She repeats Rio’s words in her head. “--Fuck you? You want me to fuck you?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      Yes!”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Suddenly, Agatha feels herself getting tense again, breaking out in nervous sweat.
     <br/>
     “Do– do you mean you want me inside? Or–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      Anything
     </em>
     !” Rio shouts, and if Agatha hadn’t been so strung up, she would’ve enjoyed the fact that she can make Rio lose her mind like this.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She brings her middle finger back to Rio’s slit, starting at her clit and sliding down between her folds until she’s close to her entrance. When she keeps still for a moment, she can feel the pulsating of Rio’s walls underneath her finger, and her own clit responds immediately to that sensation.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      Do it,”
     </em>
     Rio hisses, and that’s the last thing she needs before sliding her finger in– just one knuckle at first, but she soon realizes she can easily push it in further. Still, her curiosity wins in this moment, and she takes a minute to register what
     <em>
      being inside Rio
     </em>
     feels like. It’s not like she’s never felt her own vagina from the inside, but apart from the fact she simply wouldn’t do that for her own enjoyment, it’s so different being inside
     <em>
      another person.
     </em>
     <br/>
     Her walls are soft, slippery, clenching and pulsing around her digit. She crooks it to see what happens, and is delighted when Rio’s entire body jolts and she can’t contain a breathy moan.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “More,” she pleads.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     No hesitation this time, Agatha pulls her middle finger back out, adds her ring finger and pushes them inside together. Rio gratefully welcomes them with a drawn out “ah–
     <em>
      yessss”.
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This part, she knows. Even though being fucked like this wouldn’t do much for her, she knows what it could potentially do to other people. Rio included, apparently.
     <br/>
     She shifts her own body into a more comfortable position, laying on her side next to Rio, her fingers still inside. She presses a kiss against the side of her breast, and slowly starts pumping her fingers. Her cheeks flare up at the wet, dirty sound it makes, but it’s soon drowned out by Rio’s panting and moaning.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yes, yes,
     <em>
      yes,”
     </em>
     Rio breathes, visibly relaxing under her touch while at the same time building up her future orgasm. When she has found a steady rhythm, Agatha looks up to study Rio’s face. Her eyes are closed and her mouth is open; her face occasionally twitches when her lower body jerks. She’s a perfect middle between bliss and pleasure, and Agatha decides she could look at her like this for days. Weeks.
     <em>
      Years.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     “
     <em>
      Harder,”
     </em>
     Rio groans, and if Agatha hadn’t been looking at her face, she wouldn’t have heard it. “
     <em>
      Faster.”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Agatha changes the angle of her arm and gives her what she asks for. Her grip on the pillow becomes so strong that Agatha won’t be surprised if she ends up ripping it apart. She also notices Rio’s tongue darting over her bottom lip; her mouth dry from panting and heaving.
     <br/>
     Instinctively, Agatha leans over and kisses her roughly to match the pace of her fucking, sliding her tongue inside and giving Rio no option but to surrender. The moans that are being expelled into her mouth send her own body spiraling down her own sense of pleasure– she’s almost positive she will come undone at the first touch on her clit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But that’s not what she’s focusing on right now– she wants to keep this woman underneath her in this blissful state for as long as possible.
     <br/>
     Her pumping picks up even more pace, more force, turning every breath of Rio into a sound. She has never felt this powerful before– she could cry just looking at Rio’s trembling body.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      “M-my clit,”
     </em>
     Rio blurts out. “Touch my clit, p-please.
     <em>
      Please, Agatha.”
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Hearing her name being moaned like that ignites an even bigger fire inside of her. She is going to make this woman come, if it’s the last thing she does. For a moment, she isn’t sure if Rio means for her to take her fingers out and start rubbing her clit, or if she wants both– she decides to test her assumption by swiping her thumb over her bundle of nerves with her fingers still inside of her.
     <br/>
     That must’ve been it, she concludes as Rio’s hips violently buck up. She swipes it again–
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Circles,” Rio manages
     <em>
      ,
     </em>
     and Agatha does the math quickly. She can’t keep pumping and circling at the same time, so she stills her fingers first, starting to draw circles with her thumb. In this position, she can still move her fingers if she crooks them– and that’s when she finds the even softer, spongy spot near the front of Rio’s opening. Rio nearly screams.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Fuck,
     <em>
      fuck,
     </em>
     right there. Yes– Oh– Just like that,
     <em>
      yes, ah– fuck!”
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha finds the perfect rhythm and keeps building her up, determined to make her finish.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “K-keep doing that– oh– yes–,” Rio mutters, her body trashing, lost in the sensation. “Right
     <em>
      fucking
     </em>
     there, don’t stop, don’t stop, god, please,
     <em>
      don’t stop–”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     If Agatha hadn’t been convinced yet that Rio’s orgasmic muttering was the most beautiful sound ever, she definitely is now. She almost doesn’t want it to stop, but as it turns out, there’s something even better–
    </p>
    <p>
     Which is what happens after a final “
     <em>
      fuck, yes!”
     </em>
     and Rio’s body goes taut, hands flying out to grip Agatha’s shoulders, digging her nails into the skin there; and finally dropping one of her hands to make Agatha’s movements stop when she gets too sensitive.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio shudders one last time, and all of her muscles relax. Agatha watches her as she pants heavily, carefully letting her fingers slip out. She leans in again to press soft kisses all over her sweaty torso, her neck, and eventually her face. After a few minutes, she feels Rio smile under her ministrations.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Holy fucking shit,” she smiles in post-orgasmic bliss, her eyes still closed. “I didn’t expect you to be, like,
     <em>
      bad
     </em>
     , but I wouldn’t have dared to dream you’d be a fucking natural.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A giggle bubbles up and she finally opens her eyes, meeting Agatha’s enamored gaze. She pulls Agatha on top of her, burying her nose in her neck and breathing deeply.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You made a woman come, Agatha,” she reminds her. “How does it feel?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha had, in fact, just been realizing that. “Like– I want to do it again,” she answers truthfully.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She feels Rio’s hands roam over her back, and she has to bite her lip to not react to the tickling sensation, but Rio suddenly stops mid-motion.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Why the hell is your dress still on?” she hears muffled against her neck.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Eh– because you didn’t take it off.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      I
     </em>
     didn’t take it off? You could’ve taken it off!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah. I didn’t though. You could’ve asked.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I could’ve asked, but you could’ve just
     <em>
      offered–”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     “Are we going to debate this for another 45 minutes or are you gonna take my dress off?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     That’s all Rio needs to regain her strength and roll them both over, straddling Agatha again– instead this time, she’s fully on her back.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Looking up at Rio like this; thoroughly fucked, with her hair a total mess, red patches on her sweaty skin from the exertion, currently towering over her– she’s almost positive she’s soaking through her panties. How is this the first time they’re doing this?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So,” Rio smirks, grinding down her hips again. “Dress off, yeah?” She extends her hand to help Agatha sit upright. Right before they pull the fabric up together, Agatha shoots a pleading look up at Rio.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Slowly?” she asks, almost inaudibly so. She doesn’t need to explain that this isn’t about the dress. Rio smiles and kisses her nose.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Of course, pequeña flor,” Rio reassures her, and together they pull the dress up over Agatha’s head.
     <br/>
     She immediately feels exposed, so she lets herself fall backward, covering her breasts with her hands– but when she sees Rio’s adoring smile, she slides them down and places them on her stomach.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You– are gorgeous,” Rio whispers, taking her all the way in. The way Rio looks at her turns the feeling of being exposed into an empowered one. The longer she stares, the more she realizes– she feels sexy.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The woman on top of her still smiles, void of any teasing or taunting, and leans forward on her hands, placed on both sides of Agatha’s shoulders.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I would really, really like to kiss you here,” she says, flicking her eyes down to Agatha’s breasts.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Kiss me where?” Agatha asks, still playing Rio’s game.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Now, Rio’s smile does turn into a smirk, and she shifts her weight so she can lift a hand. Slowly, and with the utmost care in the world, she traces a line from Agatha’s left collarbone to her right. Then, without lifting her finger from Agatha’s skin, she starts drawing on her chest, her light touches swirling and tickling. Again, Agatha stifles a snort when Rio traces over a particularly sensitive patch of skin. If Rio had noticed it, she doesn’t show it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Her finger grazes further down, between the swell of her breasts. Agatha feels her nipples stiffen and she exhales slowly, trying to maintain control over –at least– her breath.
     <br/>
     Rio strokes the underside of one of her breasts, still checking in on Agatha every step of the way.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Kiss you here,” she purrs, repeating her action on the other side. Agatha flexes her chest up, her nipples so hard they almost hurt.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “They’re very sensitive,” Agatha warns her. “But yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     Rio smirks again as she unfolds her hand and fully cups her right breast, pressing the palm to the hard nipple. “Oh, I’ve noticed how sensitive you are,” she says with a wicked smile.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She lifts her hand up again and slides her index finger into her own mouth, wetting it with her tongue. When she takes it out, she brings it back down to the nipple, and starts swirling her wet finger around it. Agatha forcibly presses her lips together to keep herself from making any sinful sounds.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Ah-ah,” Rio clicks her tongue. “Let me hear you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She wets the other nipple too, and starts blowing cool air over her breasts. The coldness of it feels like a sharp pinch, but it’s weirdly enjoyable as it also sends a jolt of pleasure down to her pussy.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio repeats this a couple of times, before she bends down and covers her breasts in kisses. Not an inch is left unkissed; Rio seems to make it her personal goal to give every piece of skin an equal amount of attention. Agatha briefly wonders if this is what worship feels like.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just when she thinks Rio is finished, she takes a nipple into her mouth and swirls her tongue around it. At the same time, her hand cups the other breast, slightly digging her fingers in like it’s one of the most delicate things she’s ever touched.
     <br/>
     Agatha feels herself getting lost in the sensation, and remembers what it used to be like when she had her breasts played with– it was definitely never like this. It was always too hard, too soft, too fast, too unimportant. But this, the way she receives Rio undivided attention, she knows this is a first. And when Rio switches sides, latching onto her other nipple and causing a renewed sensation, she starts wondering if she could come like this.
     <br/>
     Every time she feels Rio’s tongue flick past the sensitive pebbled bud, a new jolt of electricity sparks down to her clit. Oh, yes, she probably could.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio shuffles down, her kisses landing on her stomach now. Soft and exploring ones at first, more intense nips and licks of her tongue later. Rio’s moans vibrate against her skin, turning her insides to lava. With multiple sensations going on at the same time she tries to keep her body still, but when Rio’s fingers
     <em>
      accidentally
     </em>
     dig into her side just below her ribs, she screeches loudly and trashes her legs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah, that’s what I thought,” Rio smirks proudly. She prods her side again for good measure, drawing another sharp yell and a giggle out of her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Who knew the great, intimidating, invincible Agatha Harkness is secretly so ticklish?” she says tauntingly, wiggling her fingers, showcasing her newly found weapons.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “If you abuse that piece of knowledge I will not hesitate to murder you in cold blood,” Agatha sneers. However, the threat sounds a lot less intimidating when it’s followed by another giggle when Rio squeezes her again. “Rio!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh, I’m going to have so much fun with this–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You are not.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yes I will.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      Absolutely not.”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You are
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     at my mercy now.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Wasn’t I already?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio purses her lips and tilts her head. “You make a fair point. But now I have something to keep you in line if you misbehave.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I fail to see why you would need something to keep me in line. I never misbe– haaaave!” she shrieks, Rio fully attacking her with her fingers now. Agatha trashes around so violently Rio has a hard time staying on top of her, but it makes it so much more fun.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Rio! Knock it off!” Agatha shouts, somewhere between a belly laugh and a growl. She feels around for Rio’s wrists, but Rio is faster and more dexterous, so she ultimately finds herself with her hands pinned above her head by Rio leaning over her, a victorious grin on her face.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha rolls her eyes, but can’t stop a delighted sigh from escaping her mouth when Rio leans down to kiss her, the meeting of their tongues almost familiar already.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When she feels Rio taking both of her wrists in one hand so the other one can sneak down her body again, she feels a faint sense of panic rise in her chest. Thinking quickly, she lowers her voice and boldly poses: “Are you going to keep wasting my precious time to tickle me? Or are you going to grow up and eat me out?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio breathes in sharply and sits back up within one second, releasing her grip on Agatha’s wrists. Agatha smirks at the imminent blush on her face.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Damn, you’re good,” Rio chuckles, sounding impressed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yes, I am,” Agatha says, matter-of-factly. Bucking her hips up suggestively, she adds: “Are you?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Does that mean I can take these off?” Rio asks, a hungry look in her eyes as her hands land on the waistband of Agatha’s cotton panties.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You better,” she answers, already lifting her hips to make it easier for Rio, who shuffles down while taking the panties with her, slowly peeling them off of Agatha’s wet core.
     <br/>
     She guides them all the way down, throws them off the bed, and crawls back in between Agatha’s legs, landing on her stomach.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The look on Rio’s face when she’s just a couple of inches from Agatha’s pussy is nothing less than
     <em>
      starved.
     </em>
     Agatha has pushed herself up on her elbows to look at her, and Rio keeps shifting her gaze between Agatha’s eyes and the meal right in front of her.
     <br/>
     Rio is almost shaking with contained excitement, and it earns her a lopsided smile from Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can I– would you feel okay if– I touched you? Here?” Rio asks throatily, a genuine sense of urgency in her voice. Agatha nods, but Rio requires verbal confirmation. “Yes?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yes.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha watches her as she reaches out a finger, exploring the soft skin on the inside of her thighs. Feeling her so close to the most intimate part of her body makes her feel uneasy at first, but again– Rio’s undivided attention and look of utter awe are so disarming that her tension quickly melts into pure desire.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     At the first swipe between her folds, both of them gasp in unison and Agatha throws her head back.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      Agatha,
     </em>
     ” Rio breathes. “Are you– do you always get
     <em>
      this wet?”
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I, eh–,” she looks back down at Rio, expecting a disgusted or weirded out look on her face, but is instead met with an admiring shimmer in her eyes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I don’t know? Just the– normal amount? I guess?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     At the sight of Rio lifting her soaked finger and sucking it into her mouth without breaking eye contact, Agatha groans.
     <em>
      That was too fucking sexy to process.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     But the comment does make her wonder– how wet is she? Isn’t she supposed to be? Is it so different from what it’s supposed to be?
     <br/>
     Before Rio can touch her again, she drops her own hand down between her legs. Even before she has reached her pussy, she feels the stickiness against her thighs. But when she slides two fingers through the copious wetness between her folds, she goes rigid. There’s actual liquid trickling down her skin.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I take it back. Not the normal amount,” she says hesitantly. “What the fuck?”
     <br/>
     She definitely has never felt herself
     <em>
      dripping
     </em>
     like this. She briefly wonders about the state of her panties, before realizing what it means.
     <em>
      And how many fucking years she has wasted,
     </em>
     but she really doesn’t want to go there now.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m going to try to not act smug about this, but I can’t promise anything,” Rio smirks, her eyes glued to Agatha’s scrutinizing fingers. As she wants to pull her hand away, Rio grabs her wrist.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No, wait,” she says, finding Agatha’s eyes again. “Will you teach me too? Show me what you like? Please?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha doesn’t even get the chance to be insecure about the request, as Rio’s pleading voice somehow makes her the vulnerable one in this situation. She slips her fingers back, gathers some more wetness from her entrance and scoops it up, spreading it around her clit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The moment she starts tracing circles around her clit, her lower body starts jerking. Her nipples and her sides are not the only extremely sensitive areas she has– which has pros and cons.
     <br/>
     Pro: she can make herself come in under a minute if she’s in a hurry.
     <br/>
     Con: she can come in under a minute if she’s not in a hurry.
     <br/>
     She needs to go slow, excruciatingly slow, to not set herself off too quickly. Switching things up helps too, which is why she alternates between swirling circles, and rapidly flicking.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio watches her fingers move with unmatched intensity. If she didn’t know any better, Agatha would think the meaning of life was being presented to Rio, right between her legs. She feels the other woman’s nails dig into her thighs, holding on for dear life as she damn near drools at the sight right in front of her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Think you got it?” Agatha inquires dryly. Rio nods and when she lifts her hand from her pussy, Rio immediately replaces it with her mouth.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha might as well have split in two. Rio hungrily starts making out with her cunt like she wants to
     <em>
      devour
     </em>
     her, and Agatha falls back on the bed when her elbows can’t hold her weight anymore. She feels Rio copying her own earlier movements but with her tongue, and within a few seconds she has lost all sense of where she is, or even
     <em>
      who
     </em>
     she is.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She had thought this would be something she would at least recognize from earlier experiences; it’s not the first time someone goes down on her and it really shouldn’t make a difference– but it does. Oh god, it fucking does.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Reflexively, her hands fly down into Rio’s hair, fingers digging into her scalp to push her in even further– but at Rio’s surprised moan, she realizes what she’s doing and quickly retracts her hands in shock.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio looks up at her, mouth still attached to her pussy, and reaches for her hands.
     <br/>
     “Mm no, come back. I like that,” she murmurs, guiding Agatha’s hands back into her hair.
     <br/>
     When Agatha registers the kind of permission she’s gotten, she allows herself to get lost in Rio’s hair, directing her by tugging her up firmly when she needs less pressure, and pulling her in when she needs more. Every time she directs her like that, Rio lets out a sinful moan, the sound vibrating against her clit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But despite the ability to tug on Rio’s hair when it gets too much too quickly, the sensation builds up fast. Agatha realizes there’s no other option than to surrender under Rio’s highly skilled tongue and mouth. It’s unworldly, really, the way Rio pays attention to her body.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When her tongue circles her clit, Agatha’s convulsions are just a little more intense when she passes the left side of it. Rio later uses that information to flick her tongue against that
     <em>
      exact
     </em>
     spot, knowing it draws the strongest reaction out of her. And when Agatha bites her bottom lip so hard it almost bleeds to keep herself from making any loud noises, Rio notices it even with her eyes closed, and swats her ass lightly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Wanna hear you,” she whispers hotly against her pussy. When she looks up again, Agatha shakes her head, breathing heavily.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Why not?” Rio asks, a hint of concern in her voice as she pauses.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m– if I let go, I can’t control it– I’m... really fucking loud,” she admits between clenched teeth.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What I’m hearing is the opposite of a problem,” Rio says. “Do you have any idea how hot that sounds?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You don’t know what you’re asking for.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So let me hear it.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When Rio dives back in, she seems to be making a point of intensifying her licks; finding the perfect angles, trying anything to make Agatha let go. It doesn’t take her very long to figure out how to do that.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The moment she places her lips around her clit and sucks, Agatha roars. The sucking lasts for only two seconds, but all ministrations that follow feel ten times more intense. Agatha tries to catch her breath and stop herself from moaning, but Rio doesn’t give her a chance– she’s relentless.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha— well, she gets
     <em>
      loud.
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Ah–
     <em>
      ah– ah–”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Her moans get gradually more pitchy, and she loses any sense of reality as every flick of Rio’s tongue brings her higher and higher into a lustful delirium. She bucks her hips up to get even more friction, the concept of buying herself more time before her orgasm now completely thrown out the window.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh
     <em>
      Rio, oh–
     </em>
     oh
     <em>
      fuck,”
     </em>
     she gasps, and just when she thinks it can’t get any better, Rio goes feral when she hears her name in the throes of Agatha’s passion. Her tongue flicks at her clit at a maddening pace.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Rioooo–” Agatha groans, the muscles in her entire body tensing up. Her thighs and calves are strung so tightly that her legs shake uncontrollably; her toes start curling and her heels dig into the mattress.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio looks up at her from between her legs one more time, and she has the nerve to
     <em>
      fucking wink at her.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     “Oh– oh god– ah,
     <em>
      ah– fffffuck!”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     First, her back arches, nearly making her spine snap. Then, she forcefully throws her head back, eyes tightly squeezed shut, mouth opened wide in a silent scream. Lastly, her thighs try to slam together, locking Rio’s head in, as everything around her stills. Her vision, even behind closed eyelids, shatters into pieces; she watches the static noise settle like snowflakes in a storm. She doesn’t think she’s still breathing, but she doesn’t need it. She doesn’t need anything anymore.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When she opens her eyes, Rio’s head is already on her chest, facing her. When did that happen?
     <br/>
     She hears someone panting, but it’s not Rio– it takes a few seconds before she realizes it’s her. She tries to move her legs, but they shake in protest and make her entire body shudder. Taking a moment to check in with her body, she figures her lower half is still convulsing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “W-what the f-fuck,” she stammers weakly. “What the– actual fuck
     <em>
      was that?”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Rio smiles at her, sucking in the corner of her lip in admiration.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “That, sweetheart,” she says, breathing in sharply. “Was
     <em>
      the most beautiful orgasm I have seen in my life.”
     </em>
     Rio closes her eyes, seemingly already getting lost in the mere memory of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh–
     <em>
      oh
     </em>
     . Well. It seems like you’re going to have a problem, Vidal,” Agatha says, making Rio’s eyes fly open in concern.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What? Why?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You’re gonna help me make up for thirty plus lost years– in one week.”

      your comments make me laugh and cry and gnaw my own arm off and I love them. I'm actually deeply in love with the stories you tell me about your experiences while reading this.

      a few people have asked me if I'm on twitter;

      EDIT - I did make an account, I caved because I wanted to lurk. come say hi @thattimewitch
     </p>
     <p>
      anyway; this chapter contains a scene that is meant to give people who understand Spanish a different experience from people who don't. if you're a part of the latter category, you could choose to stick to Agatha's perspective and try to guess (which I think is pretty doable if you have a basic understanding!) or be kept in the dark. but please feel free to shove the entire thing through google translate and get both sides of the story. both options should be fun.
     </p>
     <p>
      I am not a native Spanish speaker but I like to believe I have enough knowledge of the language to be at least somewhat coherent. absolutely do drag me through the mud if I'm not, please.

     Agatha startles awake because of a sound she can’t quite place yet.
     <br/>
     She needs a second to remember where she is. She needs another to realize she’s not the only one in her bed. And during the next second she remembers why.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She glances at the woman beside her on the mattress; she’s on her stomach, arms tucked in, clutching more than half of the bed sheet, legs sprawled out, one of them crossing Agatha’s legs even. Her face is pressed into a pillow in such a way it stretches her nose up, causing her mouth to hang open about half an inch. The softest of snores –or actually more like sighs– sound from her open mouth every few seconds. It’s absolutely ridiculous and Agatha can’t help but smile at the sight. Rio probably needs her rest.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They couldn’t have been asleep for more than a few hours. Agatha knows this, because at some point during the night,
     <em>
      or morning,
     </em>
     the first rays of daylight had come in through the curtains. By that time, Agatha had already lost count on how many times they had made each other come.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There had been the occasional water-, toilet-, or oxygen breaks. At least every hour one of them had remarked how ridiculous it was that they were still awake, and how they should probably go to sleep– which the other then would agree to, after “
     <em>
      just one more”.
     </em>
     But every time one of them finished, the other had been helplessly horny again.
    </p>
    <p>
     During one of their breaks, Agatha had looked at the time– it was a few minutes after three in the morning– and had admitted that Rio might’ve been right about 8 hour first-time-sessions after all.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      If only I had the stamina to keep going for two more hours,”
     </em>
     Agatha had said, exhausted but laughing. Of course, Rio had taken that up as a challenge– but a good half hour before their 8 hour mark, they had fallen asleep mid-kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     It had been insane. Agatha wonders if they never would have stopped if they hadn’t needed to sleep– or if they’d been at least twenty years younger.
     <br/>
     Letting her eyes roam over Rio’s very much naked back, she already knows the answer as her body responds to both the sight in front of her, as well as the memories.
     <br/>
     Sure, they both had gotten sore at some point, but even that was something Rio had shown her how to handle. That's how the night hadn’t just been endlessly sexy and fun, but also quite educational as Agatha now knows about at least six more erogenous zones than she thought she had.
    </p>
    <p>
     She vaguely understands now why men used to burn down entire villages for sex, but she also wonders how any lesbian gets anything done in their life, ever?
     <em>
      Would it always be like this?
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     With a self-judging grumble she reaches out to touch Rio’s back when she hears a knock on the door. The second one already, she realizes– the first one had woken her up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Agatha?!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Jen. Fuck.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She scrambles out of bed, frantically looking for her robe; under the bed, by the vanity– but she can’t find it anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha! I know you’re in there.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah, yeah. Patience, woman,” Agatha mutters under her breath, giving up the search for her robe and settling on the bed sheet as a substitute. But as she yanks it off the bed to wrap around herself, she temporarily forgets about the sleeping person holding onto it– and she nearly sends her flying off the other side of the bed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What the–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Shut it!” Agatha hisses, putting one finger in front of her mouth and pointing the other one at the door.
     <em>
      Jen,
     </em>
     she mouths, and turns around to answer the door, but with her hand on the handle, she realizes Rio will be center stage if it opens too wide.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So she turns back around, yells: “Gimme a minute, Jen!” and strides toward the barely awake Rio, pulls her up by the wrist, unceremoniously shoves her into the bathroom and slams the door closed a little too hard.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She walks to the main door for a second time, but stops herself when she considers what the room must smell like. She quickly opens the bathroom door again, grabs her deodorant off the counter, sprays it around the room –and on herself for good measure– and returns it, slamming the door closed again with an apologetic look on her face.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Tightly wrapping the sheet around her torso, she finally opens the door for Jen.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I hope this is important enough to interrupt my beauty sleep?” she sneers as she eyes up her friend, who is wearing a light dress and a floppy hat, an amused smile on her face when she takes Agatha in.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Morning, Agatha,” she says calmly. “Or– afternoon, I guess.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What time is it?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Just past noon. I wanted to ask you if you’re up for brunch with us? As you’ve missed breakfast and you’re not answering your phone.” Jen’s expression is still calm. Friendly. Agatha suspiciously narrows her eyes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “If I’m not at breakfast or answering my phone, Jen, do you think that could
     <em>
      perhaps
     </em>
     have anything to do with the fact that I’m asleep and would have liked to stay asleep?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Again, it’s
     <em>
      past noon.
     </em>
     I was… worried.” As the thick cloud of deodorant wafts past Agatha and reaches Jen’s nose, her face scrunches, but she doesn’t say anything.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I had a difficult night. Couldn’t sleep. I was happy to catch a few hours just now– which you ruined, so thanks for that.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Jen’s expression changes to one full of pity. “Oh no, a difficult night? I hope it’s nothing– serious?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No, no. Don’t worry. My head was just so full of– secret stuff. I mean secret to you. You and Alice, because of the wedding. Wedding stuff. Secret wedding stuff.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Are you sure?” Jen asks, crossing her arms. “Because you do look like hell. Have you looked in a mirror? And where are your clothes– Agatha, don’t tell me you’re so hot you’re running a fever again?” She reaches out her hand to place against Agatha’s forehead, who slaps her hand away before it touches her and hisses like a feral cat.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Jesus, Jen, I’m
     <em>
      fine.
     </em>
     Just tired.” She almost stares a hole through her friend.
     <em>
      Drop it. Just drop it and walk away.
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Don’t go playing the hero now. I can come in and make sure you–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Jennifer.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Jen recoils. “Damn, my whole name?” At Agatha’s expression, she throws her hands up. “Fine. Don’t say I didn’t offer. So are you coming to brunch then, sleeping beauty?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Sure, yeah, I’ll come to brunch. I’ll be down in– 30 minutes.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Jen smiles. “Great. See you downstairs.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha is about to close the door, when Jen puts her foot in the opening.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Actually,” she says, pensively tapping her cheek. “Do you happen to know where Rio is?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha’s eyebrows raise in shock, not having expected this question anymore. “Ri–
     <em>
      who
     </em>
     ?”
     <br/>
     She instantly realizes how stupid that sounds, so she tries to save herself: “Ri– oh, you mean
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     Rio. Like Alice’s friend Rio. Eh– nope. No idea.” She curves her lips down in innocence and shrugs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Really? Because she isn’t downstairs and she isn’t in her room either.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Then why would I know?” Agatha snaps. “She’s probably just–,” she vaguely waves her hand around, “Outside, doing… dumb things, because– she’s… dumb.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Jen nods earnestly. “Hm. Yeah, I hadn’t actually considered that.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh for fuck’s sake Jen, it’s not like I’m hiding her in my fucking room or something.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Jen starts laughing. “My god, no, that would be
     <em>
      wild.”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Agatha forces herself to join in the laughter. “Plot twist of the century, right?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh yeah, could you imagine?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I really couldn’t.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Their laughter dies down.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Alright, well, if you happen to see her, can you invite her to brunch too?” Jen asks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha dramatically rolls her eyes and lets out a disgusted sigh. “Ugh. I mean, sure, if I
     <em>
      have
     </em>
     to.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Thanks, dear. See you downstairs.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This time, Agatha shuts the door quickly before Jen can ask any more annoying questions. She leans against it, breathes a few times, and gives herself a little pep talk.
     <em>
      Okay. Thirty minutes to fix this mess.
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She opens the bathroom door to cuss out Rio for
     <em>
      existing,
     </em>
     but gets completely thrown off balance when her eyes land on the scene in front of her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio seems to be comfortably lying down on a bunch of towels on the bathroom floor. Apparently she had found Agatha’s silk robe in there, because she’s wearing it. Her head rests on her arms, eyes closed, like she’d just continued sleeping as if nothing had happened. But the thing that makes Agatha wanna cry and hit something at the same time, is Scratchy peeking out from a crook between her head and her arm. His playpen is right there, but safely closed off– so Rio must’ve taken him out.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha smacks her palm against her forehead and drags it down her face, ultimately cupping her own chin. Her other hand lands on her hip.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Well– You could’ve saved money by not booking an entire room for yourself as you seem perfectly comfortable on a tile floor,” she quips, loudly enough to wake Rio up. But when she watches the corner of Rio’s mouth curve up in a smirk, she realizes that she hadn’t been asleep at all.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio cracks open one eye. “If I’m ever on the run from the FBI and you have to cover for me, I’m just gonna turn myself in to spare us all from the embarrassment of your poor acting skills.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha huffs. “Rude.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio snickers and rolls onto her back, plucking Scratchy from somewhere near her neck and securing him on her chest. “You might not win a Golden Globe with that performance, but I’m sure you could get far with your comedic timing.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “There’s nothing
     <em>
      funny
     </em>
     about–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh come on, Agatha. That was fucking hilarious.” Rio pushes herself up, pets Scratchy one more time and puts him back into his playpen.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “It wasn’t hilarious and it definitely wasn’t–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “It was very funny.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The more Agatha tries to defend herself, the more fun Rio seems to have. She crawls up to get face to face with her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “It was
     <em>
      not–”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “
     </em>
     It was a little bit funny.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Not even a little bit funny.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yes. A tiny little bit funny.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Then, it’s like Agatha sees herself in bird’s eye view– the way they’re standing, no,
     <em>
      bickering
     </em>
     in the bathroom, Rio in her robe and Agatha wrapped in a sheet, nearly choking in a cloud of deodorant that had been used as a final resort to erase any evidence from their night.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha presses her lips together. “Okay. Maybe a little bit funny.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio laughs: a genuine, happy chuckle. Maybe it’s because of her small win, or maybe because of the entire situation. When her laughter dies down, a smile stays on her face. Agatha can tell she wants to say something– but she doesn’t. So Agatha does.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You’re expected at brunch in 30 minutes.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Or so I’ve heard.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So where did I find you?” Agatha asks. Rio shoots her a questioning look, so she elaborates: “If you’re not in your room, and you’re not downstairs, and you’re definitely not in
     <em>
      my
     </em>
     room– where did I find you?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh!” Rio exclaims, and thinks about it for a moment. “Hm. Right here in the bathroom?” Agatha stomps on her foot. “Ow!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio steps around her, walking out of the bathroom backwards. “I don’t know, how about– on the balcony?” she says with crossed arms and a casual nod in the direction of the windows.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Rio,” Agatha says warningly, following her into the room with a dark look on her face. Before she can catch her, Rio darts around to the other side of the bed, grinning.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “--or maybe behind the curtains?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Vidal, you really don’t want to provoke me right now,” Agatha grumbles. She reaches down to lift the sheet so she won’t trip over it, but that’s not exactly convenient. She runs out of fucks pretty quickly and just discards it, closing in on Rio fully naked. Nothing she hasn’t seen by now.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio jumps on the bed, her only option to not get cornered, and lands on her knees.
     <br/>
     “Oh, I’ve got it!” she grins, wagging a finger at Agatha. “I was in your bed all along!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha acts on instinct. She tackles Rio onto the bed, who lands on her back. Quickly, before Rio can move, she crawls over her, grabs her wrists and pins them above her head. The fire between her thighs ignites instantaneously. Oh, how she loves sparring with this woman. How she’s
     <em>
      always
     </em>
     loved it– she just never knew this type of
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     was beneath all that frustration she stirred up in her. This is weeks– months even, of pent up energy.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You’re fucking with the wrong lady,” she purrs, her face inches from Rio’s. There’s a sparkle in Rio’s eye that’s somewhere between surprised and deeply turned on.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Are you sure? I believe I’ve been fucking the right lady. All night long,” Rio replies, her tongue darting over her bottom lip. “And from the look of it, she still hasn’t had enough.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha stares at her, not liking that she's being outsmarted. Her hips grind down, deep and dirty, seemingly out of their own, because she can’t recall telling them to. The silk of her own robe, still on Rio’s body, rubs against her bare pussy. Her eyes flick down to glance at the robe which has fallen open a little, uncovering most of Rio’s upper body. Shit,
     <em>
      shit, that’s hot.
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Stealing this was a mistake,” she says softly, her heart rate picking up. She lets go of one of Rio’s wrists to pull the tie, making her feel like she’s opening a present. The present in question seems to be just as excited about it as she is, from the look of her hardening nipples.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You’re into women now, so you’re gonna have to deal with a lot more clothing theft than just this robe,” Rio teases her. “Get used to it.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha leans in even more, their noses touching now. “Stealing is bad,” she husks, her voice rough.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So take it back, if it’s such a big issue.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shakes her head, making their lips brush over each other, not quite touching.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No. I’m taking something else in return,” she says, the hand that had untied the robe now traveling down. It had been a little over twelve hours since her fingers traveled there for the first time, but the route is already familiar. The destination, however– she’s not sure she’ll
     <em>
      ever
     </em>
     get used to that.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio is soaking. Not that she’d been anything
     <em>
      but
     </em>
     last night, but this must be just from the last few minutes. Agatha nearly collapses on top of her at the feel of her smooth, slick pussy.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio’s eyes roll back and she squeezes them shut, breathing in sharply. “Agatha– we don’t– have time… Brunch– in 30 minutes…”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “If we do it now, I’m sure it still counts towards those 8 hours.” Her fingers swipe up and down through the whole length of her slit a few times.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio lets out a sound between a chuckle and a gasp. She lifts her free hand and places it against Agatha’s chest, sliding it down to cup her breast.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Only if you promise to let me guide you through another lesbian ritual later today,” she says with a strained voice, her thumb rubbing over the nipple.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What ritual?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You’re gonna cut your nails,” Rio pants, as Agatha has started circling her clit. “Or at least a few from your left hand. You almost sliced me open from the inside last night.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughs breathily. “I think we can make that deal.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio nods frantically. “Good, good.” She sucks in her own lips, slowly losing control over her breathing. “So what are you waiting for? Both of us need a shower, so you’ve got about 5 minutes to make me come.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They end up needing 4. Each.
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     About 45 minutes later, Agatha is pouring a generous helping of syrup over her waffles. Rio had just joined them at their table, a few minutes later than Agatha, and is still looking over the menu. They had each showered in their own room, but not before coordinating their arrival at brunch, because there was no way they were gonna show up together.
     <br/>
     Lucky for them, there had been no questions about Rio’s whereabouts so far.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So,” Agatha announces loudly, taking charge of their conversation, “the big day is coming up. How are we feeling, ladies?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Jen and Alice share a look, their smiles radiating.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I guess it’s weird,” Alice says, picking up her coffee mug. “To know that I’ll have a wife in a few days.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “A good kind of weird, I hope?” Jen teases her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Obviously.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Jen grabs her by the chin to give her a peck on the lips. Agatha makes a gagging sound.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     With her lips still on Alice’s, Jen's eyes flick towards Agatha, and she releases Alice with an amused smile on her face. She opens her mouth to say something, but a server interrupts them to take Rio’s order. When he leaves, Jen asks:
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What about you two?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha’s jaw tightens, and she feels Rio awkwardly shuffle in her chair.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What
     <em>
      about
     </em>
     us?” Agatha asks defensively, taking a large bite.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “How do you feel about the big day? The first guests will arrive soon, so you’re gonna have to get to work.” Jen looks genuinely interested.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh!” Agatha exclaims, quickly correcting herself for sounding too relieved. “Oh.” Luckily, Rio takes over.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I think we’re prepared,” Rio shrugs. “We’ve both taken charge of our own responsibilities, which works out great. Right?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha nods, wiping the corner of her mouth with her thumb.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m just so excited to see you at the altar together,” Rio continues, smiling excitedly. “I can’t wait to see your outfits. You’re gonna look amazing. I made sure to prepare some cool towels, because everyone will faint when they see you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alice chuckles, touched by Rio’s words. “Thanks, love,” she says, putting a hand on top of hers. Her eyes travel over towards Agatha.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So everything has worked out in the end?” she asks cautiously. “With your collaboration, I mean. At some point I was convinced we were gonna have to do everything by ourselves, but you don’t seem to be getting– in each other’s face anymore.” Alice’s lip twitches.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No, we’re not–” Rio clears her throat. “--getting in each other’s face anymore.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah, we can be civil,” Agatha adds.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Like normal grown ups,” Rio nods.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Doing grown up things,” Jen pitches in.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Exactly,” Agatha shoots her a look. “Like writing those goddamn speeches again. You’re quite content about yourselves, huh? Wanting us to hype you up twice.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You didn’t exactly hype us up the first time, dare I remind you,” Jen cocks her head with a stern look on her face. Agatha wants to counter, but the server shows up to bring Rio her omelet. An awkward silence follows while Rio digs in.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Well, I’m happy for you,” Alice eventually says, focusing on her own meal again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yes, me too,” Jen says warmly. “
     <em>
      Ecstatic,
     </em>
     even
     <em>
      .
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, sensing the tension, quickly changes the topic again. “What about the rehearsal dinner? Have you picked your outfits yet?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Of course.” “Yeah.” The couple answers simultaneously, after which another awkward silence follows. The scraping of cutlery on plates is clearly audible.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Then, after taking a breath, Jen says: “We’re actually looking forward to that day a lot. We got an upgrade to the wedding suite for our last few days here.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio’s eyebrows shoot up. “Mm, that’s great!” she says while chewing her food. “Where is it? Have you already seen it?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Ninth floor,” Alice answers. “So far away enough for–
     <em>
      oompf
     </em>
     .”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “--to get ourselves some privacy,” Jen sweetly finishes her sentence. Alice puffs up her cheeks and briefly reaches down to somewhere under the table.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha keeps staring straight ahead, knowing that she’ll break if she looks at Rio now.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “And we’re gonna need it,” Alice mutters under her breath.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      And–
     </em>
     it’s amazing,” Jen quickly adds, “because there’s a bathtub…  a small living area… we can open the windows,” she sums up dryly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “We can open the windows!” Alice breathes out in a relieved sigh.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha narrows her eyes at them both.
     <br/>
     “I cannot put into words how over the moon I am about the both of you– getting some fresh air,” she deadpans.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     At Rio’s audible snort, she whips her head around. “
     <em>
      What?”
     </em>
     she snaps, but Rio shakes her head and keeps eating, so Agatha flips her off.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “That actually reminds me,” Jen says, pointing at Agatha’s middle finger. “We’ve got a manicure booked. Alice, we’ve got to go.”
     <br/>
     Getting up from her chair, she says to Rio and Agatha: “I’m sorry to leave you here– but we assumed you’d be here earlier.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “That’s okay,” Rio says.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Go be fabulous,” Agatha dismisses them with a wave of their hand. They say their goodbyes and turn to leave.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Once Jen and Alice are out of earshot, Agatha nervously leans in and whispers:
     <br/>
     “Do you think they know?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio starts laughing so hard she drops her fork. At Agatha’s concerned expression, she gets all serious again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Impossible.”
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     After they finish their meals, Rio suggests they go visit a little hippie market in town. Agatha agrees, but tells her she’ll need a change of clothes first, to which Rio replies she doesn’t see any reason
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     to help her with that.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Never in her life had swapping a sundress for shorts and a shirt taken close to 90 minutes before, but there’s always time for firsts, she muses as the two of them eventually walk down the road towards town, their faces still flushed. And who could blame them? Agatha had definitely needed help with the zipper– even though she’d been perfectly fine closing it by herself earlier. And not taking advantage of those skilled hands already so close to her naked skin… well, that would probably be considered a crime and she wasn’t about to go to Mexican jail.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I might be starting to understand your comment about those hormones,” she admits begrudgingly when they're almost there and Rio puts her hair up, making it unable for Agatha to tear her eyes away as her top moves up, exposing her skin.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They approach the market and Rio chuckles breathily while she secures her ponytail. “Don’t tell me you’re horny again?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Again, or still? Maybe you just weren’t thorough enough,” Agatha says, haughtily looking away.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Of course, Rio wouldn’t be Rio if she didn’t have anything to counter that. “So tell me, because I lost count: how many orgasms did you have in the last 24 hours? And how many more would you have needed to be satisfied for a while? Just give me a number and I’ll have you right here in an alley until you stop complaining.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha groans; this isn’t exactly helping to extinguish the already growing fire in her core. “Don’t say things like that if you’re not planning on actually doing them.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They start strolling past the various stalls, every single one displaying the most colorful fabrics and jewelry. It’s so crowded that it’s hard not to bump into people, so Agatha finds them a way through the crowd first, Rio following closely behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Who says I wasn’t going to? You might be in your second puberty, but you make me enter my third,” Rio whispers in her ear.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     At that, Agatha can’t help but smirk. “Nah, you’re just a damn animal in heat.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio pretends to get bumped by someone, so she can stumble forward and let her hands land on Agatha’s hips from behind. She firmly digs her fingertips in as a warning. “Careful who you’re calling an animal, tiger,” she snickers as Agatha tries to slap her hands away, but it only makes Rio laugh harder.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You seem to be the one who can’t keep her hands to herself,” Agatha says through clenched teeth.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You like it,” Rio purrs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Do not.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No? So if I were to slide my hand down your p–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Rio, if you don’t shut up right now–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Then what?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio’s teasing voice in her ear and her possessive hands on her hips make her shiver. She knows she wouldn’t have tolerated this behavior if they were back home, but for now she can’t say she dislikes the attention she gets. It helps that most of the locals won’t understand them.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As they’ve made their way through the most crowded part, Rio releases her hips, and hops forward to walk beside Agatha again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You’re beyond help, Rio,” Agatha says, side-eyeing her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You started it, babe.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      Babe? Was that just a casual babe, or–
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     She doesn’t get any time to process the word, because Rio quickly takes her hand and smoothly intertwines their fingers. Shocked, Agatha looks down. “Wha–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Relax, I just don’t want to set up a coordinated search if I lose you here,” Rio says calmly, squeezing her fingers.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha can’t help but feel like she’s being pulled from one corner of her comfort zone to the other, with Rio dragging her through all the remnants of reservations or shame. With anyone else, she would have protested– but Rio’s confidence is so reassuring she doesn’t mind it for now. Rio will catch her, she knows that. And if she says the word, Rio will respectfully take a step back. She knows that too, which is enough for her not to fight her on this.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She chooses absolutely not to be juvenile about it, so she sighs loudly and dramatically rolls her eyes, emphasizing Rio’s slip up. “Okay.
     <em>
      Babe.”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     When she looks back up at her, she catches Rio staring at her with a new kind of sparkle in her eyes; one that she hasn’t seen there before. Rio lifts their joined hands up and brings them to her face, when they get interrupted by a woman at one of the jewelry stalls.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “¡Hola guapas! ¿Esta bella dama es vuestra esposa?” she asks Rio, beckoning her to come closer.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio snorts, at loss for words for a few seconds. “Ya quisiera, señora.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Ahh,” the woman seems to nod understandingly. “Ella tiene…” She eyes up Agatha and continues in a whisper, “¿...un marido?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio looks at Agatha too, smiles, and replies: “Los hombres no tendrán ninguna oportunidad.” She squeezes Agatha’s hand again, who gets impatient now.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Eh– hello? Translation please?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Ah, ¿ella no entiende español?” the woman grins at Rio.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No, I
     <em>
      do not
     </em>
     entiende español, señora
     <em>
      ,"
     </em>
     Agatha says in a thick accent. At Rio’s amused, raised eyebrow, she snarls: “I got
     <em>
      that,
     </em>
     thank you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The woman reaches out to tap Rio’s arm. “Ella es una dama temperamental, entiendo por qué la amas.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio suddenly gets all flustered, stammering syllables which don’t make sense in either language. Agatha’s frustration about being left out turns into amusement.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No sé… No sé si la–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The woman shakes her head and turns toward the bracelets on display behind her. “No es ningún secreto, cariño. Está en todo tu ser.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh my god,” Rio mumbles, pushing her sunglasses up in her hair to pinch the bridge of her nose.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What is she saying?” Agatha demands.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “She– just wants to sell us a bracelet,” Rio replies, deliberately not looking at her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The woman takes a green, delicately hand-braided bracelet off the rack. “A las mujeres les encantan los regalos. Esta pulsera tiene magia. Unirá el destino del receptor al del donante.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha crosses her arms at the woman wiggling her fingers around the bracelet. “Is she cursing it?” she asks defiantly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Something like that,” Rio says, and she sighs. “¿Cuánto–?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No, no, no!” The woman starts smiling and shakes her head. She takes Rio’s free hand, and places the bracelet in her palm. Then she looks over at Agatha and says in a thick Spanish accent: “For free.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha snickers. “Thank you, but why?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As the woman finds Rio’s gaze again, she says: “Solo soy una pequeña bruja vieja, no necesito dinero. Soy feliz cuando puedo unir dos almas destinadas.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha tugs on Rio’s shirt, waiting for a translation again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “She says– this will protect you from demons. And you very clearly need it, because you’ve angered quite a few.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Before Agatha can be offended, Rio quickly says: “Muchas gracias señora, encontraré un momento especial para regalarlo.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio receives an endeared smile, Agatha a wink. She feels utterly confused as Rio pulls her away from the stall.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What was–” Agatha wants to ask, but Rio holds up her hand, and turns around to the woman one more time.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “¿Señora?” she asks. “¿Eres usted realmente una bruja?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The woman’s eyes spark mysteriously as she puts her index finger up in front of her lips.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No importa, cariño. Lo que importa es que la magia y el amor son reales.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     To absolutely no one’s surprise, Agatha keeps bugging Rio about the bracelet and the weird interaction all day, despite Rio’s frequent requests to just drop it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio had pocketed the bracelet once they’d left the stall, and had since refused to even just show it to Agatha, who had kept asking to get a closer look.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Eventually, Rio resorts to heavy measures, promising Agatha to give her a closer look of
     <em>
      something else
     </em>
     if she shuts up about it. Agatha figures she’s only human, so she accepts the deal, eventually cashing in her prize after Jen and Alice had gone to bed and Rio had pretended to retreat to her own room– only to sneak out at a safe moment and spend the night with Agatha instead.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It continues to be like this for a couple of glorious days: stealing moments to get each other naked during the day, secretly sneaking into each other’s room at night, bickering and provoking each other in between. It’s easy to let a little more carelessness slip into their dynamic; because of how normal it feels, but also because of how high their libido is. Still, they are careful around Jen and Alice, as her sudden sapphic splurge still isn’t something Agatha is ready to shout off the rooftops.
    </p>
    <p>
     This means they keep finding excuses to touch each other in public– making it seem innocent, but necessary, of course. They keep sharing glances, virtually exchanging images of their heated memories through their eyes, and when there’s an opportunity to lean in and whisper something outright
     <em>
      filthy
     </em>
     to make the other desperate to go to one of their rooms with a serious sense of urgency
     <em>
      ,
     </em>
     they gladly take it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     That’s also how it goes on the day the guests are about to arrive, both of them already mourning the loss of free time when they wake up. They know they’re not going to be able to sneak away as much, so they’ll have to make the most out of it before having to step into the roles of hostesses.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha is dedicated to not go overboard with that, however. She didn’t fly to Mexico to lock herself up in her hotel room all goddamn day.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But that afternoon, when she finally sits herself down on a comfy lounge chair outside, it’s Rio who walks past her, pretending not to notice her at first, then turning around to casually lean against the arm rest to ask Agatha if she’d be willing to help her out with something.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Help you with what?” Agatha asks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio sighs like the weight of the world is on her shoulders. “I just need– I need to be fucked so bad, Agatha,” she pleads, like she’s asking for a huge unpleasant favor. “Do you know anyone who could help me out?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha reaches the elevator before Rio does.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When they get to the fifth floor, buzzing from the energy it takes not to touch each other yet, they practically run towards Agatha’s room. Agatha fumbles with the room key and once the door opens, she shoves Rio inside, almost making her trip. Before the door is all the way closed, she already has Rio up against the wall, her mouth pressed hotly against Rio’s, hands splayed out against her bare stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck– this– and fuck– you,” she mutters in between kisses. “For being– so– goddamn– insatiable.” She nips at Rio’s bottom lip, making her gasp so she can slide her tongue inside. Rio’s moan is sinful, and she loses her composure for a second before doubling down in intensity, biting and sucking back at Agatha’s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m the insatiable one?” Rio says in mock offense, cupping Agatha’s ass with one hand, and the back of her head with the other. “Do you remember who woke me up this morning by rubbing her needy pussy against my thigh?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This time it’s Agatha’s turn to gasp, thrown off guard by Rio’s dirty talk. She has a sense Rio knows how weak she is for it, but still she tries to hide her reaction lest Rio uses it to her advantage.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I learned from the best,” she says breathlessly, kicking Rio’s feet apart to buck into her core with her own thigh.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio laughs and throws her head up in blissful surprise. “Oh fuck, I’ve created a monster.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’ll show you a monster,” Agatha growls. She kisses her again, hard. She gratefully drinks up Rio’s moans when she replaces her knee with her hand to press her palm against her pussy, applying pressure over her shorts.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio tilts her hips up against her hand, needing more friction, but Agatha smirks and moves her hand back.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Agatha,” Rio sighs, releasing Agatha’s ass to grab that same hand. Agatha deftly flicks her wrist out of Rio’s grip and captures her hand against the wall. Rio gives her an impressed smile and shakes her head.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “A beautiful, powerful, insatiable monster,” she says almost proudly, before freeing herself again with a sudden tug, now sliding both hands in Agatha’s hair to pull her closer. “Fuck, you’re hot,” she groans against her mouth.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha’s entire body heats up as their lips and bodies keep slamming into each other. “I need you,” she breathes. “Need to be inside you.” Even before she finishes her sentence, her hand slips behind the waistband of Rio’s shorts, letting out a surprised squeak as her fingers immediately brush through a familiar patch of hair, instead of underwear.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Presumptuous,” she snaps playfully, revelling in the way Rio’s body tenses up as she finds her way between hot, damp folds. The moment her fingertips graze her clit, Rio lets out a hot, open-mouthed sigh that she’s convinced will send her straight to hell. She’ll gladly follow her, she decides then and there.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “It’s not fair,” Agatha strains, letting her fingers travel lower to find Rio’s entrance. “Why do I keep
     <em>
      wanting
     </em>
     you all the time? Why can’t I stop thinking about it? And why–” she feels enough slickness, so she pushes two fingers in, “why is it so fucking heavenly to touch you like this?” Once her fingers are all the way in, she curls them, turning Rio into a whimpering mess.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Feeling Rio come apart like this is immensely satisfying; she feels powerful and in control. And yet, there’s a weird sense of frustration bubbling up inside of her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Seriously– what the fuck,” she says, finding Rio’s lips again. “This isn’t– this isn’t normal, to want something, someone, this much.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She straightens her fingers, pulls them out, and adds a third one before slowly adding them back in. Rio’s breathing turns into uneven gasps, like she’s trying to say something but she’s too far gone.
     <br/>
     The need to fuck her senseless rises, but the frustration is not gone.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I want to– goddamnit Rio, I need to hear you scream,” she pants. “I can’t get enough of– of wiping that smirk of your face and just– fuck you until you can’t even remember your own fucking name.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Her fingers pick up pace, and while she slowly comes to the realization that her frustration is also part of all that pent up and locked away energy, she now starts to understand what’s happening. Apparently, she isn’t the only one with a weak spot for dirty talk– Rio seems to completely lose herself in Agatha’s words, which makes Agatha feel even more controlling. It’s a feeling she
     <em>
      likes,
     </em>
     a feeling she chases, without even knowing it. A feeling she’d never been interested in exploring, until she could see what it does to Rio when she takes the reins.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Coincidentally, that’s when Rio confirms those feelings. “Ah– Agatha,” she manages between gasps and yelps. “I don’t– I don’t know what brought this out in you, b-but–
     <em>
      ah, fuck!
     </em>
     I’m not– complaining. F-fuck, yes babe, fuck!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      You did
     </em>
     ,” Agatha says, almost accusingly. “You brought this out in me. This is your fault. You made me like this.” Her brows knit together in pleasure and surprise at how it affects her own pussy to have Rio like this.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “And I can’t fucking stop,” she breathes, using her other hand to pull Rio’s shorts down, giving her better access. With her hand now in a new, better angle, she pushes her fingers in even deeper. Rio can barely hold herself up anymore and has put her chin on Agatha’s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then d-don’t stop,” Rio pleads directly into her ear. “Don’t f-fucking stop.
     <em>
      Take me.”
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Those words make Agatha go feral. She pumps into her with fervor, her own ecstasy strongly pulsing between her legs. Her hips buck forward and she realizes she can use that to put even more force into her hand– and starts fucking her even harder.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      Oh my god.”
     </em>
     She hears the high pitched, drawn out vowels breathily in her ear. “Oh. My. Fucking. God. I’ve never– oh god, I’ve never felt– Agatha, please,
     <em>
      harder.”
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha breathes in sharply and fucks her with everything she has, blind with lust. And when she bucks into her own hand at the right angle, she soon finds out, she can stimulate her own clit too, making her moan in sync with the woman coming apart in front of her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Shit, Rio,” she whimpers, while the other woman moans her name. It’s hot, it’s sweaty, her wrist hurts, but she isn’t gonna stop until Rio comes completely undone.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Some more expletives leave Rio’s mouth, but nothing coherent, until the only thing Agatha can make out is: “Close– so, so close–” and she didn’t even know that
     <em>
      announcing her orgasm
     </em>
     would be one of the sexiest things she’s ever heard. She’s doing this. She’s giving this to her. It adds to her own building orgasm, she’s getting close too–
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio lets out a strangled cry, forcefully gripping Agatha’s hips and bucking into her a few more times before her whole body tenses up. Agatha fucks her through it, paying close attention to her body language, and catches her just in time with her free hand when her knees give in. She carefully slips out her fingers to be able to hold Rio up with both her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jesus fucking christ!” Rio shouts with her eyes closed, hanging limply in Agatha’s arms. Agatha is unsure what to make of
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     emotion as she comes to her senses.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Rio– Rio, baby, look at me. Look– oh my god, I’m so sorry,” she stammers, desperately trying to get eye contact to see what’s going on. But when Rio finally looks up at her, there’s nothing but pure adoration.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What on earth could you be sorry for?” she pants.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Well, I was– I kind of lost– I mean, I was kind of rough, wasn’t I?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio, while still breathing heavily, carefully puts her weight on her own legs again and her mouth curves into a lazy smirk. Then she chuckles, wipes her own forehead with the back of her hand, and says: “Oh Agatha. Was that all you got?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When Agatha’s eyes go wide and her jaw drops, she instantly takes her words back, giggling. “I’m kidding, I’m kidding,” she quickly says. “But that was– my god, woman, you’re a fucking goddess. That was hot. Like, I don’t think I’ve ever been fucked like that. It’s usually me doing the fucking.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And while she knows it’s a compliment, her mind immediately conjures images of other woman fucking or being fucked by Rio. It unsettles her. How many were there? Why is she being compared? And what can she do to be and stay at the top of the list?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Suddenly, Rio seems to remember something.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Did you…?” Her eyes flick down, stay there for a second, and flick back up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha’s face twists, now reminded of how close she’d been. “No,” she says.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Without any more words, Rio pushes herself off the wall and walks backwards towards the bed, pulling Agatha along. She lets herself fall onto her back, making Agatha crawl on top of her. Sliding her hands back into her hair, she pulls her in for a messy kiss.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Let me get my mouth on you,” she murmurs against Agatha’s lips. Agatha grins and wants to roll them over, but Rio stops her. “No. Get up here,” she says, tapping Agatha’s ass to guide her in the right direction.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha looks down at herself, and back up, needing a minute to process the request.
     <br/>
     “Do you mean–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I told you I was going to treat you like a queen, Agatha, so for fuck’s sake, take your throne.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And no matter how much she hesitates, those words turn her right back on and make her desperately needy. While half of her brain is still wondering if it actually means what she thinks it means, the other half of her brain is already getting herself off the bed to take off her shorts and underwear– and her shirt too, while she’s at it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Crawling back over Rio’s body, they find each other’s eyes again. Agatha can’t help but cup Rio’s face in her hand when she sees the desire, the adoration, and the sheer happiness in there.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Are you sure?” she asks softly. “I don’t wanna… squish you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio rolls her eyes. “If you kill me by sitting on my face, I will turn into a ghost and come back to thank you for it.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha feels her face flush. Again.
     <br/>
     “What does it taste like?” she blurts out. Despite their many steamy moments over the past few days, one of the few things Agatha hasn’t gotten herself to do yet, is going down on Rio. It still feels like another step she isn’t ready to take. Luckily, Rio doesn’t laugh at her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Have you ever tasted yourself?” she asks with a tone of genuine interest.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha presses her lips together in thought. “Maybe. A long time ago.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Why don’t you do it now?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She looks at Rio, horrified. “W–what?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Why don’t you taste yourself now?” Rio repeats. “If you wanna develop a taste for, you know– other pussies. Why not start with your own?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     At Agatha’s clear hesitation, Rio decides to be bold and reaches down, swiping a tender finger through Agatha’s wet slit. Without breaking eye contact, she brings the finger to her own mouth, licking it clean while smirking.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha’s breath hitches. “Well?” she asks, half still terrified and half amused.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “That’s
     <em>
      at least
     </em>
     a two Michelin-star taste,” Rio grins.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha rolls her eyes. “How many stars is yours?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Five, obviously.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You’re aware the maximum is three?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So can you
     <em>
      imagine
     </em>
     how good it is?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     With the challenging look in her eyes still intact, Rio now gathers some slickness from between her own folds, making a show of licking her finger clean.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Mm, actually, yours
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     better,” she pretends to reluctantly admit. She reaches out to Agatha again, who twitches when Rio touches her.
     <br/>
     This time, she holds up her newly wet index finger with a questioning look in her eyes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Wanna try?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And Agatha doesn’t feel like she does, but before she knows it, she has wrapped her fingers around Rio’s wrist and is leaning forward to suck the fingers into her mouth.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The first thing she notices is the way Rio’s jaw drops in desire at the sight, her pupils expanding visibly. Then, her own taste hits her. It’s salty, but also kind of sweet and musky. She doesn’t hate it, but it’s not something she can compare to anything she can put to words.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She keeps the finger in her mouth for longer than necessary when she sees what is does to Rio. She swipes her tongue playfully around it, eventually biting the tip. Sucking one more time for good measure, she says cheerily: “All clean.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The look in Rio’s eyes turns deliciously dangerous. “Good girl,” she whispers; a sharp and well aimed attack at Agatha’s nervous system, who groans and almost surrenders when the words hit her ears. “Yeah, I can see that doesn’t do anything for you,” Rio quips.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Will you shut up if I sit on your face?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Probably.” Rio tilts her head back to look behind her. “Come, let’s scooch. Sit down and hold on to the headboard.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They move across the mattress, positioning themselves so the headboard is in front of Agatha. She crawls up Rio’s body until she hovers somewhere above her chest.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Come here babe,” Rio encourages her. “And don’t be afraid to just sit down. You won’t hurt me. I want you all over my face.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha wants to hide the things those words do to her so badly that she just complies and moves farther up, slowly lowering her pussy onto Rio’s mouth. At first, she feels a few light kisses against the inside of her thighs, her mound, and her outer lips. But because of how close Agatha had already been a few minutes ago, she can’t stand the teasing. Something takes over and she grinds her hips down, pushing Rio’s entire face against her.
     <br/>
     She hears a muffled sound, perhaps a chuckle– but the moment Rio’s tongue darts out and swipes along her slit, both women moan loudly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha soon realizes that, with her legs spread widely like this, Rio has full access and greedily takes it. Her hands come up to the back of her thighs, digging her nails in, and her tongue gets to work between her folds. Like she’s used to from Rio now, her first licks are explorative, to see which spots are particularly sensitive and which ones set her off the most. It doesn’t take her longer than a few seconds to find those spots.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio’s hungry enthusiasm takes away any uneasiness she feels about being in this position. She eats her out with even more excitement, which makes Agatha loosen up pretty quickly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When she hits a particularly sensitive spot, Agatha hisses as her arms shoot forward– now understanding why Rio suggested she should hold on to the headboard. She grips it tightly, her knuckles whitening.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Ohmygodohmygodohmygod,” she babbles, straining to keep her hips from grinding down and accidentally killing Rio in the process. “Oh! This is–
     <em>
      oh shit.”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     If she’d thought this would be the same sensation as Rio eating her out while she’s on her back, she now realizes she couldn’t have been more wrong. It feels more intimate, more thorough, more precise somehow. Rio sounds like she’s dug into a delicious meal– which is probably what she thinks too.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Every time Rio’s tongue swipes her clit, she bucks up– to keep herself from coming too fast, from grinding down, and from collapsing. But after a few times of doing that, Rio pulls her hips down with an angry growl. “Stay.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I can’t, Rio,” Agatha pants lightly, her grip on the headboard tightening. “I– oh fuck– I can’t– ah!” Apparently, Rio is in no mood for excuses, because she feels a sharp suck on her clit. “Shit!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     One of her hands instinctively flies down to Rio’s head, but she stops herself in time and ends up lightly stroking her hair.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio briefly tears her mouth away from her pussy. “Do it,” she hisses. “Do what you were going to do.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She drags her tongue through her slit again, ending with another suck to her clit, compelling Agatha to do what she’s told: taking a fistful of Rio’s hair and pushing her face in deeper. She shocks herself with her boldness, but it feels
     <em>
      so good
     </em>
     that her hips uncontrollably start grinding down at the same time. The pleasure races through her entire body, making her legs shake.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      Yes,"
     </em>
     she hears a muffled sound from between her legs. When she looks down, the sight almost sends her over the edge.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio is fully dedicated to her task, clearly enjoying every second. There’s a thin layer of sweat– or maybe it’s her own slick?-- on the part of her face she can see. Her eyes are closed, and the way her fingers still dig into Agatha’s hips cause her to try and cover as much of her face as possible.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha decides to try out what happens when she starts actually riding her face. Not only do the sounds from beneath her become louder, but her own as well. Rio’s mouth, tongue, and even nose and chin, hit her in ways she’s never experienced before, and there’s no stopping her from being loud again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Fuck– oh Rio– keep going,” she exclaims, before letting out a high pitched moan on every grind. She feels herself getting lost in her pleasure, but when she feels her orgasm building, she starts shaking so hard, she panics.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Shit, shit, shit, Rio–” she gasps, her second hand joining the grip in her hair now, putting almost her entire weight on Rio’s face. “Wait– shit, oh– wait–” she begs, because she doesn’t have enough control over her own body to make herself stop.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio slows down her tongue for a moment, and looks up at Agatha with a concerned look on her face. “What is it?” she asks softly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I can’t– keep myself up– when I come,” Agatha manages while her own hips keep stuttering. “My legs– won’t hold me–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio’s worry turns into desire. “Hot,” she says hoarsely. “So don’t keep yourself up. Let me see what happens.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She starts licking again, but doesn’t close her eyes this time. The eye contact she keeps with Agatha drives her absolutely wild. Never had she thought about having a woman between her legs– underneath her, even– looking up at her with this much pure want. In a way that, not unimportantly, turns
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     on beyond measure too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Surrendering to the fact that Rio won’t mind if she breaks down on top of her, she gives in. She uses both hands in Rio’s hair to press herself into her face, getting herself off just as much as Rio is trying to lick and suck her towards an orgasm.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Shit,
     <em>
      shit,
     </em>
     this is so good, oh my god,
     <em>
      oh my– god–”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     The muscles in her legs start to give out, so she frantically tries to hold herself up by her upper body; her hands fly back to the headboard, but that doesn’t work– back to Rio’s hair, but that almost makes her topple forward–
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She reaches back with one hand, placing it somewhere near Rio’s hip, and she puts part of her weight on it, making her back arch. Her other hand is still in her hair, holding on tightly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Rio– Rio, right there– suck,
     <em>
      yes, suck!”
     </em>
     Rio immediately understands what she needs, putting her lips around her clit and softly suckling it until Agatha
     <em>
      screams.
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Her entire body trashes, not only her legs giving out but her abdominal muscles too– and the arm that she’s leaning on can’t take the blow of suddenly carrying her entire weight, so her elbow buckles and she collapses backward.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Not able to talk, or move, or even see, she feels Rio carefully wiggle her way out from underneath her after a few moments– just so she can turn around and take Agatha in her arms, checking in on her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You okay?” Rio asks with a smile on her face, brushing Agatha’s hair out of her face.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha, panting like she’s just ran a marathon, says: “Oh my god.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Does that mean yes?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      Oh my god.”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <br/>
     “I’ll take that as a yes.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh. My–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio cuts her off by pressing their lips together. Both of them sigh contently.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know we probably don’t have time, but I would really, really like to do that again,” Rio says with a wicked smile. “I think I even–” She reaches down between her own legs. “Oh. Yeah. Yep. I just came again.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha covers her face in her hands and groans. Rio pushes herself up on her elbow and gives her a small peck between her breasts.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Let me check if we can get
     <em>
      one more in…”
     </em>
     she says mischievously, before searching for her phone which had at some point landed on the bed. She taps the screen and–
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Shit! Agatha!” Within one second, she shoots up, throwing herself off the bed. “The dinner! The dinner is starting! We’re late!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha needs half a second to process what that means, before she suddenly regains control over her muscles. “You’re kidding?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I wish I was, we have to be downstairs in like five minutes.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Fuck.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They both hurry to gather their clothes, Rio eventually running back to her own room for a quick shower and a change of clothes. Agatha does the same, rinsing herself off, not bothering to wash her hair and praying the smell of sex won’t linger.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She throws on the suit she had packed for the rehearsal dinner– a fuchsia pantsuit with an oversized jacket and a white sleeveless top underneath. They had all agreed on the dress code: Jen’s friends and family would wear any color related to pink on the color spectrum, whereas Alice’s guests would stick to blue. She’d figured the suit would be perfect for the dinner so she could wear her dress for the actual ceremony.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She quickly corrects her smudged mascara, and applies a hot pink lipstick that matches her suit. Nearly suffocating herself with perfume, she decides she’s good to go.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When she leaves her room, Rio is already walking down the hall. They’re in such a hurry, they even forget to enter separately, like they’ve been doing religiously for the past few days. Finally entering the part of the restaurant they’d rented out for the rehearsal dinner, both chests heaving, they pointedly ignore the looks from Jen and Alice and throw themselves onto their task of welcoming the guests who are already there.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     While putting on her fakest smile, Agatha speedruns through shaking the hands of Jen’s family, hugging her friends, quickly catching up with them and sitting them down. She vaguely notices the decorations, which, she has to give it to Rio– look stunning. The garlands, balloons, glitter, and photos of the couple everywhere are way too over the top for her own liking, but she knows Jen and Alice would love it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha catches a glimpse of Rio every now and then, but she deliberately looks the other way when she does. There is no need to be reminded of what they were doing only ten minutes ago, and they have some catching up to do here if they want to keep Jen and Alice from being mad at their tardiness.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And while Alice might be someone to let it slip, unfortunately, Jen isn’t.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Where were you?” she asks with a big smile on her face, but her tone deadly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I was– well–” Agatha stammers, she has no idea what to say and her brain is too busy to come up with a lie. “I’ll explain later.”
     <br/>
     When her gaze lands on a person with long red hair from the corner of her eye, she uses her as a buoy and launches herself at her. “Wanda!” she squeals. “How lovely to see you here!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She ignores both Jen’s eye roll and Wanda’s surprised expression. She recruits every single brain cell to engage in small talk as to save herself from questions she doesn’t want to answer.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When eventually, all guests have arrived and they take their seats, Agatha is relieved to be seated all the way across from Rio. At least they won’t be getting any questions together, and no one will have to watch them interact with each other.
     <br/>
     When the pink and blue suited waiters arrive to bring out everyone’s first glass of champagne, Agatha softly blows out the air she’d been holding in.
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     Initially, the uneasy feeling in Agatha’s chest starts as adoration. Throughout the evening, her eyes keep drifting towards Rio, whose body is wrapped tightly in a baby blue dress, and she admires how much control she seems to have over her own likeability. She chats everybody up, treating everybody to a warm smile, and everyone seems to adore her. Just like Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, the adoration gets a sour aftertaste. Not only because Agatha isn’t nearly as skilled (nor interested) in making people like her as Rio, but also because she feels weird about not being on the receiving end of those chuckles, smirks, and empathetic responses.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The sourness quickly starts to overshadow every sense; not just her taste, but her stolen glances start to sting and catching a waft of her perfume makes her nauseous. Her radar is working overtime; when the dinner is finished and guests are starting to mingle, she senses where Rio is at any given moment, without wanting to. She doesn’t
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     to be so aware of her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It gets later, and the only two things Agatha wants to do, are impossible options. She either wants to bail– but she can’t do that to Jen, or she wants Rio to talk to her, but she can’t make that happen either, as they’ll draw too much unwanted attention. The nausea is still there, but she’s also aware of a new, unknown feeling in her chest. It feels like a claw inside of her, but instead of it being attached to some kind of monster,
     <em>
      she
     </em>
     feels like the monster. Why is Rio not paying as much attention to her as she is to Rio? Isn’t she on her radar? Doesn’t she get distracted by Agatha’s presence?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A few minutes to midnight, she gets her answer. While she’s quietly sipping her champagne, being the third person in a conversation between two other people, she catches some parts of the dialogue Rio is having right around the corner with one of Alice’s friends.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What about you?” she hears an unknown female voice ask her. “When are you getting married?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio snorts and immediately answers. “Oh, no. I won’t be getting married.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Why not? Do you have a partner?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I don’t,” Rio says, her low voice giving away her awkwardness around the subject. The woman she’s talking to doesn’t seem to notice.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh, why is that?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m really not interested in dating, Hannah,” she hears Rio sigh. “I’m not looking for a partner.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Without knowing why, Agatha feels like she’s being punched in the gut. Oh. Okay. Rio doesn’t want to date. She isn’t looking for a partner. Big deal.
     <em>
      Big fucking deal.
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It takes about three seconds before Agatha’s nausea gets so bad, she realizes it is, in fact, a big deal.
     <br/>
     She scolds herself for not having thought about this before, for not having asked about this before– but she can’t really blame Rio, can she? They’d never talked about this. And why would they? The thing between her and Rio had always just been about her sexual exploration. Not her romantic one. She wouldn’t even be ready for that anyway. She’d only just started to have sex with a woman, she doesn’t even want to
     <em>
      think
     </em>
     about dating one. Especially not Rio. Stupid Rio.
     <br/>
     Rio could fuck her into next week and just never talk to her again, and she’d be fully in her own right. So why does the pressure on Agatha’s throat rise so badly?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Why does she feel like she can’t breathe?
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And why are her eyes getting wet?
    </p>
    <p>
     “Excuse me,” she says, her voice rough, clearing her throat to cover up a sob. She pushes her way through the people who’d been standing around her, slams her champagne flute on the nearest table, and strides towards the exit. She needs air, and lots of it.
     <br/>
     Finding her way to the main entrance, she almost breaks her neck walking down the stairs with her heels on, so she takes them off. Barefoot, she walks down the path off the grounds– she doesn’t know where she’s going, but she knows she has to keep walking.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She needs to get away, far away enough for nobody to find her. Somewhere she can be alone. Somewhere she can allow herself to break down.
     <br/>
     She clenches her teeth;
     <em>
      don’t cry,
     </em>
     she tells herself.
     <em>
      You can cry when you’re alone.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Fucking Rio. With her dumb stupid face.

    <p>
     With her heels still in her hand, Agatha wanders across the beach to the shoreline. From the look of it, she’s here all alone. Good.
     <br/>
     She hesitates for a second as she’s still wearing her formal clothes, but decides to sit down by the water anyway, and places her shoes next to her in the sand. Stretching her feet out in front of her, she lets the water come up to her ankles with every wave. The moon’s reflection causes the surface to shimmer like tiny diamonds, but only minimally; it’s almost new moon, Agatha realizes when she looks up.
     <em>
      New beginnings. Yeah right.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Just as she’s about to take a deep breath, she’s vaguely aware of a presence behind her. And right when she turns around–
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Don’t freak out!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Which are, ironically, the words that make Agatha jump and release a very uncharming shriek.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Motherf–
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I said don’t freak out!”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In the distance, she can vaguely make out the silhouette of Alice who approaches her shyly, dragging her feet through the sand. She holds her shoes in her hand too; elegant light blue sandals that match the color of her shorts suit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     With her hand still on her chest to recover from her almost-heart attack, Agatha stares at her friends’ fiancée with a confused look.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Alice? What are you doing here? Aren’t you supposed to be at your own party?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alice keeps walking, one corner of her mouth curved up, until she stands right next to Agatha.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Aren’t
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     supposed to be at the party you organized?” she asks, but it’s clearly rhetorical. “Can I sit?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha respects Alice too much to tell her to get lost, so she waves an approving hand. As Alice sits down with her legs crossed, Agatha turns back to face the water, but side eyes her  \suspiciously after a few moments.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Is this when you’re gonna ask me why I walked away and then we bond over a few deep life lessons?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alice shrugs. “If you want to.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, it can’t be a coincidence that you’re here, right?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Maybe I just needed some fresh air?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “In the exact same spot as me, a full five minute walk from the hotel?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alice chuckles humorlessly. “Okay, so I did follow you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “There it is,” Agatha says pointedly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Are you going to be mad at me for wanting to check up on you?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha inhales, but isn’t sure how to answer that. She lifts her legs, digs her heels in the sand, and rests her elbows on top of her knees, clasping her hands together in the middle.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I guess, if it had to be someone, I’m glad it’s you. But I already feel guilty about keeping you from your friends and family, so please–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You didn’t ask me to follow you, did you? It’s my choice to be here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shrugs one shoulder and nods. She had really hoped to come here alone, and had definitely not expected Alice of all people to join her, but here they are. As long as she isn’t going to ask difficult questions, she is gonna be fine.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So-- you’re glad it’s me,” Alice repeats, a careful tone in her voice. “Why wouldn’t you rather have Jen check on you–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha interrupts her with a scoff. “I love her to death, but you of all people should know that she can be a little intense sometimes.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “--or Rio?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     At that, Agatha tenses up. She purses her lips to try and look casual, but under Alice’s prying eyes she knows she’s too late to hide her reaction. With a sigh, she drops her head. She had already been on the brink of tears before she sat down, but hearing Rio’s name now makes it worse. Trying to shield her emotion from Alice, she dips her head lower and covers her face with her shoulder. She appreciates Alice not making any attempt to physically touch her for comfort.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When Alice doesn’t say anything, Agatha peeks up at her. But when she realizes that Alice has been looking at her the whole time, she quickly averts her gaze again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You look like you’re about to say ‘
     <em>
      oh honey,’
     </em>
     and I do not like it,” Agatha says, the sound muffled against her arm.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh, honey,” Alice sighs right on cue, making the both of them smile weakly. “I don’t know, you tell me. Is this an ‘
     <em>
      oh, honey’
     </em>
     kind of situation?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “More like an
     <em>
      ‘oh I shouldn’t have mentioned her, here’s a drink’
     </em>
     kind of situation.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah…” Alice drawls, and she hears her feet shuffle in the sand. “She can be an intense woman to be the first to fall in love with,” she eventually continues, almost inaudibly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha sharply whips her head up, the embarrassment of her watery eyes immediately forgotten.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      What?!”
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alice meets her gaze head on– her expression challenging, but not hostile. It’s more like an invitation to be honest.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When Alice doesn’t say anything, Agatha snaps: “Care to explain?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alice smiles knowingly, and does break eye contact this time. Staring at the horizon, she calmly says: “I don’t think I need to. I’m not blind, Agatha, nor am I an idiot.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Then I must be the idiot, because I have no idea what you’re–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Are you going to keep this up for another hour, or can you put your big girl pants on for me, so we can skip this whole spiel?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha opens and closes her mouth, unintentionally mimicking a fish. Between her and Jen, Alice has always been the softer person. The good cop. So witnessing her breaking character and using tough love on her, throws Agatha off guard.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Wow,” she eventually just says.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m sorry Agatha. But someone has to help you with this, because whatever’s going on between you and Rio almost set the hotel on fire and I would still like to get married there,” Alice says, her words still harsh but her voice friendlier this time.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So why don’t you talk to
     <em>
      her?”
     </em>
     Agatha deflects swiftly, but Alice doesn’t let up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh, I am going to. And she will be quaking in her flip flops when I’m done with her. You, unfortunately, peeled yourself off of her first, so here we are.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha grumbles low in her throat. She doesn’t like how cornered she feels, right by the vast ocean. After a few seconds of silence, she reluctantly asks: “Does Jen know?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alice laughs. “Does Jen know?” she repeats, and laughs again, louder this time. “Jen has been bugging me about the 20 bucks I owe her for weeks.
     <em>
      Months.”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Months? What the hell did you bet on?” Agatha wants to know, half offended and half intrigued.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “On you and Rio having feelings for each other.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha lets out a dismissive, disgusted sound, a little too loudly to be taken seriously. “Even if that were true, which it isn’t– how could you even prove that?”
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     “Because,” a loud voice behind them says, “Jen is also not blind, not an idiot, and unfortunately, most certainly
     <em>
      not deaf.”
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alice and Agatha quickly turn around, both surprised to see Jen approaching them, her demeanor more determined than Alice’s.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “And I’m going to be honest– going off of the sound, it makes
     <em>
      me
     </em>
     wonder what Rio is capable of in bed. Alice just won’t agree to putting her on my hall pass.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Shit. Shit shit shit.
     <br/>
     It’s clearly meant to be a joke, but neither Alice or Agatha laugh due to Jen’s intense energy. She walks up to them, and hikes up her dress to sit down next to Agatha on the other side.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Both Jen and Alice look at her expectantly, waiting for a mortified Agatha to say something.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So if you’re here,” Agatha croaks, looking at Alice, “and you’re here now too,” a nod to Jen, “then whose dinner party is everyone having?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It’s an attempt to lighten the mood and distract them from Jen bringing up their nightly activities, but there’s an awkward tension between the three of them. A couple of thoughts settle in Agatha’s brain: the fact that Alice and Jen had known more about Rio and her but hadn’t said anything, and the fact that they’d discussed it with each other.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “If you two already know everything, why are you trying to torture it out of me?” she spits, a feeling of hurt creeping into her chest.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Obviously, if it was something you’d want to share, we would be happy to listen and support,” Alice answers. “But you were clearly trying to hide it, so we didn’t want to confront you. Until–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “--you made it everybody’s problem. Again,” Jen finishes her sentence. “Just now by taking the most dramatic exit ever, which I have to give you massive lesbian points for–”
     <br/>
     Agatha rolls her eyes, “--and the last few days by fucking each other stupid. Or I sincerely hope that’s what it was, because if not, I’ll have Rio arrested for tearing you apart and pulling you inside out. My dear god.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     If the beach could split open right beneath her and swallow her whole, Agatha would be eternally grateful. Her cheeks burn so hot it almost hurts; this might be the most embarrassed she’s ever felt. The only light on the horizon was the fact that, despite Jen’s cross way of expressing her annoyance, she can still sense that
     <em>
      she
     </em>
     can see the humor in this situation. Which she actually prefers over anger, she thinks at first– but she starts second guessing that very, very soon.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Initially we thought the fire alarm was going off,” Jen continues unperturbed, “then we figured it was probably coming from our upstairs neighbors, and you know what, that could’ve been it! You could’ve gotten away with it, until–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “She’s been holding this up for ages, I’m so sorry,” Alice mumbles under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     “--until
     <em>
      someone
     </em>
     shrieked a name, which Alice then had the presence of mind about to
     <em>
      point out
     </em>
     so I couldn’t unhear it–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Sweetie, I think that’s–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “--and if only it had been an ordinary name, like Lisa or Emma, but
     <em>
      no,
     </em>
     you left nothing to the imagination as there happen to be very few people with the name
     <em>
      Rio–”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Agatha, who had already buried her face in her hands, slumped even further down. Could she bury herself here? No, scratch that. She’d prefer to roll into the sea like a washed up whale.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “--I would’ve been perfectly happy just spending your session deciding whether you sounded more like a howling monkey or one of those screaming goats, but no! You made sure to make us pay attention by giving us an extremely detailed description of where, when, how, and how long you needed her to–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Jen, I feel like she understands now,” Alice tried interrupting her again, reaching behind Agatha to place an arm on Jen’s shoulder.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh does she?” Jen barks. “Because we cried. Agatha, I cried,
     <em>
      three times.”
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     At Agatha’s raised eyebrow, Alice snickers. “That’s true, actually. At first we laughed so hard we cried. Then, when we realized what it meant, we cried happy tears at the idea of you two being together. Jen cried a third time from pure exhaustion because she couldn’t sleep.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha drops herself onto her back, her body limp in the sand. “Are you two done?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She hears Jen exhaling loudly. And then a second time. “I think so,” she eventually says. “For now.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So can you please go back to your own party? I feel bad enough. And if people start wondering where you are–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “They probably think we’re fucking in a bathroom,” Alice says, mischievously winking at her fiancée. “So don’t worry about it.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Alice flops on her back too, next to Agatha.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Just tell us what your game plan is,” Jen says, still pressing, but not as tense anymore. Then, she lays herself down next to the other two.
    </p>
    <p>
     “My game plan?” Agatha huffs, looking up at the stars. “You’re really asking the wrong person. Ask Rio what kind of games she’s playing.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I have a feeling she isn’t playing any games, Agatha,” Alice says softly. “She hasn’t opened up about it, which tells me more than enough. She is… she looks…” not able to find the right words, she decides to continue: “Let her tell you how she feels about this. I’ll talk to her first, but then it’s up to you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Please don’t talk to her,” Agatha pleads. “It’ll look like I asked you to do that. I’m already the biggest loser of all losers. And it doesn’t matter anyway– she doesn’t want anything to do with me once we’re out of here.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Doesn’t she?” Alice asks her incredulously. “Have you asked her?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha presses her lips together. She doesn’t want to talk about the conversation she overheard, because if she says it out loud, it will mean too many things.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “She won’t know we had this conversation,” Alice promises her. “I’ll just confront her with what I’ve been noticing.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Jen, who has been keeping an eye on Agatha the whole time, pipes up. “But what do you want, Agatha? What do
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     feel?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha doesn’t answer right away. A million things happen in her mind, but she’s not sure which ones are true and which ones are worth saying out loud. Eventually, she turns her head towards Jen, and whispers: “I think I’m a lesbian.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Jen looks at her for a few seconds, baffled, and then dramatically puts her hand on her chest. “Agatha Harkness is a fucking dyke?” she exclaims. Then she drops the act and deadpans: “In other shocking news, bears shit in the woods, the pope is catholic, water is wet, and so is your p–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “This is why I don’t tell you things,” Agatha interrupts her, but Alice softens Jen’s response by clarifying: “Jen’s just telling you we’ve been keeping your seat warm. And we’re happy you finally decided to join the club.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha rolls her eyes. “I’m not sure I necessarily
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     to join the club. I just want to–” She stops herself as soon as she realizes her answer has a shocking amount to do with Rio.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You just want to–?” Jen annoyingly reminds her to finish her sentence.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Nope.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh yes. Tell us, dear, what is it that changed your mind?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Not saying it.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “It helps if you say it out loud.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No, you just want to hear me say it.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Ha! So there
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     something to say.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha scrunches her face. “I’m about to strangle you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Kinky. So, are you in love with Rio?” Jen powers through.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Before Agatha can fire something back, Alice interrupts them.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You don’t have to tell us, Agatha. As long as you’re going to be honest with yourself and with Rio.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha turns her head around to Alice and smiles. “I’m so glad Jen’s about to marry a reasonable person,” she says.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh, I don’t know about reasonable,” Alice mumbles, looking at her guiltily. “If you don’t tell us until after the wedding, I’m getting my 20 bucks back.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I hate you both.”
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha spends the entire night in bed thinking. She tries to ignore the empty feeling which has a lot to do with the absence of Rio next to her for the first time in a few days. It had taken some careful planning to get back to her room without the risk of being seen by her, and yet the lack of a text or any other form of contact initiation from Rio speaks loudly; she feels both rejected and validated by it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Her stomach has been swirling uncomfortably ever since she’d left the dinner. Not even twelve hours ago she and Rio had been devouring each other; she never would’ve expected everything to crumble down so fast, ultimately leading to her somewhat prompt and clumsy coming out to her friends. If it even deserved the title of coming out– it seemed Agatha had been the only person who’d been surprised about it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When she wakes the next morning – the day of the wedding – she still can’t stand the idea of running into Rio, so she’s grateful to act as Jen’s personal assistant. She doesn't even mind being bossed around, and when Jen happens to prosper as a full bridezilla, she is perfectly happy to calm her down and bring her to reason. Anything to distract herself.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She does happen to quite literally run into Rio once, while they’re both speeding through the hallway running errands for their friends. Luckily, she has the presence of mind to stammer that
     <em>
      it’s, eh, bad luck for the maid of honor and the best man to see each other before the wedding
     </em>
     , and so she leaves a dumbstruck Rio behind as she power-walks through to fetch a different eyeshadow from Jen’s room that she’s 99% sure she isn’t going to use anyway.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     For the remainder of the morning and early afternoon, she attempts to lighten the mood in Jen’s bridal suite by putting on music and hyping the other bridesmaids up in a very un-Agatha-ish way. She thinks she might’ve taken it a little bit too far when she earns herself an ‘
     <em>
      I know what you’re doing’-
     </em>
     look from Jen, but she quickly fires back by pretending to lock her mouth with a key, pulling the waistband of her shorts out, and dropping the non-existing key into her underwear. Jen responds to her act with an unimpressed look, so Agatha feigns to retrieve the key, only to pull out her middle finger, and proceeds to turn the volume up some more.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Right before it’s time for the ceremony, Agatha finishes up her own look. Her hair is down, but the messiness looks somewhat tamed as she’d taken a straightener and then a curling iron to it; she’s wearing a tight lilac dress with see through mesh in the front and framing her waist. It’s a dress Jen had picked out for her, as it matches the other bridesmaids’ dresses– hers is just a shade darker than the other ones.
     <br/>
     She hugs Jen tightly and murmurs something in her ear that probably has the words
     <em>
      I
     </em>
     and
     <em>
      love
     </em>
     and
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     somewhere in there, and excuses herself to leave and check up on the location of the ceremony.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As she makes her way to the exit of the hotel, she takes a few deep breaths while rubbing her temples to soothe her incoming headache. Everything is going smoothly so far; she only has to keep this up for a few more hours. As long as she can pretend that Rio doesn’t exist, everything will be fine.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But of course, when she walks down the path leading to the large garden on the lot behind the hotel, she sees a person busying themselves with rearranging the flowers by the gazebo. She doesn’t need to walk closer to see who it is, but unfortunately, she has to.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Once she approaches the rows of chairs that have been set up neatly, she frantically looks around to find something to do.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Hey!” Rio says cheerily as she senses Agatha’s presence.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Hey, how’s it going?” she greets her curtly and not awkward at all. She decides Rio’s answer is not worth listening to and focuses on her task of prepping the space that is very clearly already prepped.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She decides to start rearranging the lined up chairs, until they’re in a worse state than before. She swears under her breath and drags them back to their initial spot. When she sees the (fake) wedding officiant arrive from the corner of her eye, she lets out a relieved huff of breath and practically throws herself in the direction of the woman, but Rio gets there first and shakes her hand with a wide grin.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In an almost practiced professional fake-out, Agatha’s determined stride changes course and she pretends to iron out an incredibly urgent and stubborn crease from the white carpet which will function as the aisle.
     <br/>
     Even though her eyes are down, she watches Rio and the officiant like a hawk. She needs another few deep breaths to not color the crisp white fabric with the contents of her stomach.
     <br/>
     Because for the first time, she takes in Rio’s sky blue suit. She wears slacks and a tight waistcoat that pushes her breasts up a little; no shirt underneath, but an oversized blazer covers up her arms and shoulders. She talks to the officiant animatedly using her hands, which brings Agatha’s attention to her casually rolled up sleeves and the many rings on her fingers. Her hair is elegantly clipped back, and there’s a gentle curl in the strands framing her face.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It’s the way Rio effortlessly mixes formality with casualness, the way the waistcoat gives her an androgynous vibe while her hair and face give her feminine power, the way she seems to charm and control the energy around her– that makes Agatha’s inside churn.
     <br/>
     Watching her talk to someone else, even though it’s a platonic conversation, makes her want to get up and punch something. The idea that she has to watch Rio be funny and friendly with everyone for the rest of the day, in
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     outfit, makes her want to kick the people who approach her in the hip. She wants to tug on the collar of that blazer to bring her in, she wants to rip that waistcoat open, and she also wants to scream and run away.
     <br/>
     When she catches herself having these thoughts, she gets vaguely melancholic about the Agatha she was just a couple of weeks ago. Where did that outspoken woman in control go? And why is she
     <em>
      like this now?
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She’s not sure she likes this version of herself, and she definitely can’t afford to be distracted like this.
     <br/>
     That’s when she decides to do what she does best: throw her walls back up, straighten her spine, and act the fuck out of the entire wedding ceremony.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It still comes surprisingly natural to her; to smile, to greet the guests, to shake hands of the people she hasn’t met before, to guide them to their places. Even taking her place in front of everyone, lining up with the other bridesmaids on Jen’s side and mirroring those on Alice’s side, doesn’t bother her as much as it should. As long as she can wear her mask, she can behave exactly the way everyone expects her to.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She cheers and applauds on cue; first when Jen gets walked down the aisle by her father, and later Alice by her mother. She does genuinely get a little emotional when she sees the two brides taking each other in for the first time– Alice wears a black pantsuit, unsurprisingly, and Jen steals the show wearing an elegant white jumpsuit. They truly look like each other’s match, and most importantly: they look happy and in love.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It all goes by in a flash: their vows, while inducing some tears from the audience, are as sappy as Agatha would expect. And even while maintaining her collected composure, she can’t stop herself from rolling her eyes and pointedly clearing her throat a few times, earning herself a few chuckles from the guests and a deadly glare from the brides.
     <br/>
     She wouldn’t know how Rio reacts to Agatha upstaging herself because she is absolutely not paying attention to anything that happens beyond where Alice is standing and so she dedicates the proud flutter in her chest when Rio’s mouth curves up to Wanda’s annoyed scowl.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And because Agatha has been so perfectly aligned with herself throughout the entire ceremony, it hits her like a brick when the officiant declares that
     <em>
      the wife and wife may now kiss
     </em>
     and when they do– her heart shatters into a million pieces.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It feels like someone twists her neck, steals the air from her lungs, and forcefully pulls tears to the front of her eyes. The duality of the sensation is making her dizzy: the amount of love that both brides exude and pour into their kiss is almost nuclear, their happiness contagious– but there’s another feeling she can’t quite place. There’s a voice inside her head screaming both
     <em>
      I want that
     </em>
     and
     <em>
      I can’t ever have that
     </em>
     , but she decides not to listen to it as she recognizes the irrationality of the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     Her ability to breathe doesn’t quite return until the very end of the ceremony when Jen and Alice walk off, cheered on by all the guests, nearly tripping over each other from how tightly they hold each other while they walk. She briefly clocks the redness of Rio’s nose and her watery eyes when she looks around, but is relieved one of Alice’s bridesmaids taps her on the shoulder so she faces away from her. As the guests excitedly start talking to each other, Agatha looks at her watch.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Three hours until the reception.
     <br/>
     There is no way the brides won’t want to spend some time with each other beforehand, so Agatha knows she’s not needed for a while, giving her the opportunity to sneak away.
     <br/>
     She silently backs up, away from the crowd, paying close attention to whether someone is watching her this time. And when she’s sure no one will or can follow her, she turns around and follows the path leading deeper into the garden.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The greenery happens to be a pleasant surprise. She lets herself become distracted by various trees and plants, and wonders why she hasn’t explored this area before. She comes to a halt in front of a large patch of dahlias, their various bright colors standing out against the green and brown. It’s easy to get lost in nature’s beauty and it calms her down; watching and comparing different colors and patterns takes her mind off of the strange state of limbo she feels she’s in with Rio.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     After ten minutes of that mindful calmness, the universe decides it has been more than generous enough to Agatha.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     While gliding a finger over the soft texture of one of the flower petals, she hears a faint rustling sound coming from the shrubs behind her. She turns around and curiously watches the leaves lowest to the ground move and shake. Crouching down, she tries to get a better look, expecting to see a wild squirrel or a bird.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She gasps when she eventually makes out a familiar tuft of white fur and an excited little sniffing nose finds its way through the bushes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      Scratchy?”
     </em>
     she exclaims. “What the hell are you doing here?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She leans forward to scoop up the rabbit, holding him up by his armpits to glance him over and confirm he is indeed
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     rabbit. “What?” she whispers again, incredulously staring at him while he begins kicking his hind legs in the air.
     <br/>
     She takes him into her arms to make him more comfortable, holding him close to her body. With her mind going a million miles an hour, she presses her nose in his fur with an absent look in her eyes. Near his neck, her nose lands on something that isn’t fur.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Even more confused, she tips her head back again, feeling around his neck with her other hand. Her fingers touch a loosely tied string around him; and attached to the string is a small, velvet pouch. She fumbles at it to untie the pouch, which is a little bit of a struggle with one hand, so she sits herself down on a patch of dried grass. Crossing her ankles, she places Scratchy in the space between her legs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When she finally retrieves the pouch she squeezes it gently, but it’s not hard or heavy. She slips both her index fingers in the elastic and peels it open, only to reveal a folded up note, and…–
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It’s the braided bracelet from the market. Fucking Rio. Stupid,
     <em>
      stupid
     </em>
     Rio.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Her hands start trembling as she plucks the bracelet from the pouch, letting it dangle in front of her face. She stares at it as if it had personally offended her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I have questions, Scratch,” she says dryly. She looks down at him, strokes his ears for a moment, and puts her finger under his chin to lift his little head up. Narrowing her eyes at him, she continues: “Where were you between the hours of 1 and 3pm?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Scratchy yawns.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Pleading the fifth, I see,” she mutters. “Fine. Whatever. You want to call a lawyer, mister?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “He already had me on speed dial, actually.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha whips her head up and her breath catches as she meets Rio’s gaze, casually leaning against a tree. She’s still wearing her best man outfit, except for the blazer.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Rio,” Agatha hears herself say, somehow both surprised and accusing. Her brain is going so fast that it won’t surprise her if there’s visible smoke coming from her ears. She should’ve expected Rio to find her eventually, except– she would’ve wanted it to be on her own terms. But apparently, when it comes to Rio, it never is. She always asks for what she wants and only ever gets what she needs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Out of the hundreds of questions on the tip of her tongue, the one she settles on is: “how did you– get him from my room?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio, who has one casual hand in her pocket, making her entire demeanor even more striking, at least has the decency to smile shyly. “Like I told you before; you’d be surprised what people are willing to do for you if you speak their language.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha glowers at her. “Meaning?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Disculpe, perdí la llave de mi habitación. ¿Tiene una de repuesto?” Rio says, pretending to hold her hand up for the room key, and Agatha wants to kill her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     However, her initial feeling of aggression turns into something else quickly– a searing hot sensation creeps up from her neck towards the tips of her ears as she pictures Rio walking up to the hotel desk, charming someone into handing her a key, and entering her room to pick up her rabbit. She must have hidden him well to get him here, too– and above all, Scratchy must have completely trusted her to let this all happen.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m gonna have you arrested for breaking and entering,” she mumbles through the images taunting her mind– but she’s not sure whether watching the real life Rio in front of her is any better.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Entering, sure. But it was hardly breaking,” Rio counters, and she nods at Scratchy. “It was a team effort.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha exhales slowly. Rio takes the silence as an invitation to approach her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What’s this about, Rio?” she eventually says, while Rio sits herself down in front of her, crossing her legs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It really shouldn’t surprise her when Rio gives her a boldly honest answer right away.
     <br/>
     “I would like to know why you’re, respectfully, being a dramatic ass bitch.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      Excuse me
     </em>
     ?” she shrieks, wrapping Scratchy up in her arms in an attempt to ground herself.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio tilts her head, unimpressed. “Yeah, no. We’re not doing this,” she says, moving her finger back and forth between the two of them. “I’m going to drop the act and I suggest you do the same.”
     <br/>
     When Agatha keeps glaring at her – a silent challenge and invitation – Rio continues: “I know that Alice and Jen know. I knew since the first night– and I think you did too. It didn’t take a detective to come to that conclusion.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha clenches her jaw, the reminder of what her friends had apparently heard causing another flash of embarrassment. She almost feels the veins in her cheeks widen in real time as her skin colors pink.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I also know that you somehow picked up the idea that I’m not interested in you, which, by the way, goes wildly beyond my comprehension,” Rio calmly states. “But as that conviction makes you give me the silent treatment, I figured I should be even clearer about why I’m invested in this.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio waits for an answer, but Agatha comes up with nothing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Invested in this?” she asks, shrugging in ignorance. “I couldn’t possibly imagine how you’d be
     <em>
      invested in this.
     </em>
     You were the one to tell me you wouldn’t date
     <em>
      baby gays.”
     </em>
     She spits out the last two words while making air quotes with one hand.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio seems unfazed– she must’ve come prepared for this. “I think I am just as invested in this as you are,” she says, her voice like honey.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Why would you even think that I–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Would you be sulking for almost a full day if you weren’t?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m not sulking.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio puffs up her chest to go against her, but decides in a split second to use the means necessary. “Señor Scratchy, can you call your mamá out on her behavior? She might take it from you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As if on cue, the rabbit starts thumping one of its hind legs against Agatha’s bicep in quick succession. Rio starts laughing– fuck, there’s that sound again, that genuinely happy sound that makes its way through Agatha’s ears to her brain, sinking down into her chest.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Traitor,” she growls, but she isn’t sure if she’s addressing Rio or Scratchy.
     <br/>
     At the same time, she acknowledges Rio’s courage and honesty in this moment and it motivates her to get in tune with herself.
     <br/>
     “So what if I was? So what if I was sulking and so what if I was invested? You were very clear about your principles– you don’t want to date anyone who’s not an established lesbian. Or actually, I believe I heard you say you don’t want to date at all. There’s nothing for me to do other than accept that, is there?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What?” Rio seems to be thrown off balance. “You heard me say that? When?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yesterday,” Agatha says in a small voice. “At the rehearsal dinner. I overheard you talking to someone.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You heard me– oh my god. Agatha.” Rio shakes her head and presses her thumb and index fingers into her eyeballs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      What?”
     </em>
     she spits, not liking the feeling of being patronized.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “First of all,” Rio says after taking a deep breath. “If I can find the patience to let you come to terms with who you are, fighting against your own principles– I think you can bring it up to cut me some slack when it comes to mine.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When Agatha looks at her dumbly, she elaborates: “Of course I want to date. Of course I want to date
     <em>
      you.”
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Well– how could I have known?” Agatha raises her voice to not let those words reach the innermost part of herself. “How was I supposed to know if you like spending time with me?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio starts laughing again, raking a hand through her own hair and looking up for a moment. “This might be the gayest thing about you, I’ll give you that one,” she snickers as her eyes land back on Agatha’s, an adoring expression on her face.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I fail to see how a conversation can be gayer than– you know, kissing a woman, but please explain,” Agatha says, not sure if she’s offended, amused or just confused. Possibly all three.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “The most lesbian thing about you isn’t my head between your legs, Agatha. It’s the fact that I have been
     <em>
      literally
     </em>
     telling you how into you I am, for months,
     <em>
      months–
     </em>
     and here you are, asking me how you were supposed to know whether I even like you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I guess everything you say is open to multiple interpretations,” Agatha defends herself weakly. And she knows it. “I’m sure you haven’t
     <em>
      literally–”
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh, I have. Literally. And I just did it again, so if you still feel the need to hide behind your fear of being rejected, I’m going to spray you with a water bottle until you can meet me in the middle somewhere in this conversation.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m not a
     <em>
      cat
     </em>
     .”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So retract your claws and jump off the counter, please.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha huffs, still not convinced of what Rio is trying to tell her. Her eyes drift down to Scratchy again, whom she catches nibbling on one of the ends of the bracelet.
     <br/>
     “Hey, that’s not food, my friend,” she says softly, pulling the string from his mouth and carefully putting it back in the pouch.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m scared too,” she hears Rio eventually say, the sound of her voice much more intimate now.
     <br/>
     “Because you liking me, you choosing me– you can’t promise me that it’s not your body talking. Who knows what happens when you get back home now that you’re free to explore all these new possibilities that I introduced you to? This has never been without risk for me, either.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha looks at her and blinks a few times.
     <br/>
     “But– but you kept talking about– me dating others. You told me to get out there and basically offer myself up to the first available lesbian.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio answers her with a lopsided smile. “Please try to remember whose thighs were wrapped around my head the other day,” she says jokingly, and yet her sultry voice does things to Agatha’s insides. Luckily, Rio quickly turns serious again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “When I knew I was falling for you–
     <em>
      for a woman who wasn’t out yet,”
     </em>
     she emphasizes, “I knew the only way to get close to you was by talking to you, but mostly by letting you go. I couldn’t risk you running for the hills if you’d ever feel cornered, marrying the first lesbian you’d come across with bigger biceps than me.
     <em>
      That’s
     </em>
     why I wanted you to get out there. I wanted you to choose me as your best option, not as your only option.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio’s words seem to float in her direction as small tendrils of some invisible substance she’s defenseless against– seeping into her skin wherever they land on her, making their way through everything that she is, settling down in her soul. Rio’s thoughtful nature has always been Agatha’s soft spot, especially when she can be such a joker too– but even now it seems everything has had a reason. And Rio had been vulnerable through it all, even if she radiated confidence.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     After a few moments of silence, when Rio assumes her words have gotten through to Agatha, she continues: “For you, it was about finding who you were, what you liked. For me– my stakes were always way, way higher. It was about– love. And I was never going to stop pursuing you, unless you would specifically ask me to,” she whispers. “You used
     <em>
      a lot
     </em>
     of hurtful words, Agatha, but never those. You never asked me to stop. That was enough for me to hold on to. And here we are.”
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Agatha feels tears prickling behind her eyes, and she swallows them away.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So–” she begins, her voice cracking, “--what does that mean? Have you f-fallen for me?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio’s jaw drops, her hand stilling in her hair as she swipes it back again. “
     <em>
      Oh my god,
     </em>
     Agatha, I
     <em>
      literally
     </em>
     just told you.” She nods at Scratchy. “I even
     <em>
      kidnapped your fucking bunny!”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Agatha averts her gaze, but the corner of her mouth curves up. “That sounds an awful lot like a confession, Vidal.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Have you read the note?” Rio presses on.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Oh. The note. Right.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha carefully retrieves the piece of paper from the pouch still in her hand, and unfolds it.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
     </em>
     <em>
      Let’s keep falling together
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Underneath it is a small but detailed sketch of their penis statues– the ones they had sculpted months ago and had dried out leaning against each other.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And it’s just too much– Agatha’s brain blinks out and so her reflexes come to the rescue.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “How’d you get him to write this?” she quips, pointing at the rabbit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio looks up at her with a murderous gaze, unfolding one leg to softly kick her in the shin.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Agatha,” she says, straightening her spine. “This is my best English: I would very much like to start dating you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Once again, Rio’s directness completely obliterates any attempt at keeping her at distance; the only option she gives Agatha is to be as vulnerable as she has been. And even though Agatha doesn’t have an immediate answer for her, she does meet her there by opening up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “That means we’d have to go back to square one,
     <em>
      again,”
     </em>
     she softly voices her concern. “You already promised me once to go back to the beginning, to start from scratch– and it led us here.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio smiles at her, a genuine, open expression. “I’m happy to restart this as many times as it takes. Because in case it still hasn’t gotten through your thick skull: I’m way too fucked up about you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “But why?” Agatha croaks. “How– why– when did you know?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “When I watched you shamelessly tell an entire room full of people about walking in on your friends fucking in the kitchen– I knew I had to make you mine. No matter how long it would take,” she admits, a shy grin on her face.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha feels herself getting even weaker. Her mind goes back to that day– it had been such an effort to get through that night for her. Back when she’d still mistaken her attraction to Rio for annoyance, back when they’d both still go out of their way to get on each other’s nerves; that had apparently been the moment
     <em>
      she’d made Rio fall for her?
     </em>
     <br/>
     And she hadn’t even been
     <em>
      trying?
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What about you?” Rio asks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Me? Who says I’ve fallen for–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh shut the fuck up, Agatha.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha presses her lips together, but the tension in her body has built up so much that it leaves her mouth in an unfiltered giggle. She’s laughing at herself, really.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I had my suspicions when you got under my skin so badly during our first meeting over coffee,” she snickers, slowly trying to mold her face back into neutral.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “But if you’re asking me when I– like–
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     knew?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio nods.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Just now,” she whispers, almost inaudibly, but keeping her eyes locked onto Rio’s. “When you said the words ‘
     <em>
      make you mine’.”
     </em>
     I think, I– I think I want that, Rio.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     At first, Rio doesn’t respond at all, making Agatha squirm. Then, she sharply inhales, holds it– and the sparkle Agatha has missed so much returns to her eyes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When she watches Rio visibly being at loss for words, she pats herself on the back in her mind.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “God, I sound like a loser,” she sighs, when she goes over her last sentence again. She drops her head into her hands. It makes Rio laugh.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Way to kill the moment, but I’m not sure what I expected,” she says amusedly. “Though I feel like I have to tell you: the way you went through the entire range of a lesbian relationship in two weeks, you’d be an enigma in the queer community. You know that, right? Absolute fucking top dog.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha pinches an eyebrow. “What do you mean?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m so glad you asked.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio lifts her hand to count on her fingers, her smile brighter than the sun.
     <br/>
     “Let’s start with the general concepts you got down: the denial, the libido, and the dramatics.
     <em>
      God,
     </em>
     the dramatics.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha wants to roll her eyes, but she’ll give this moment to Rio.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Then, more specifically: you went from kissing to fucking to not knowing how to stop pretty fast, you keep making me work for it, you blew my mind emerging as a top just a couple of days after your first time,
     <em>
      or at the very least
     </em>
     a power bottom–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What’s a–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “We’ll circle back to that one,” Rio says with a wink. “Next up, you’ve already gone on holiday with your date, which wasn't up to us technically. But I’m still counting it.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha raises an eyebrow, silently asking if she’s done.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “And lastly, the dramatics.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You already mentioned that one.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Did I? I guess yours deserves another honorable mention.” She snorts. “I could keep yelling in your face how deeply I’ve fallen for you, and you’d still wonder if I can stand being in the same room as you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     For a moment, Agatha narrows her eyes at her. Then, she relaxes, and a lazy grin appears on her face.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You could yell what?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “How deeply I’ve fallen. For you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Mm.” Agatha rubs her own cheek absentmindedly. “I wish you could just tell me how you feel, because I really have no way of knowing.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio finally catches on, and crouches over to sit beside Agatha. She places a careful finger under her chin. “I am… so into you,” she says, trying to make eye contact.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But Agatha sighs dramatically. “If only I knew how you really–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You drive me crazy, Agatha.” Rio cups her face in her hands. “I’m so
     <em>
      fucking
     </em>
     attracted to you, I feel it in the way my body responds to you, the way I keep wanting to know more about you–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha smirks. “I guess,” she says, “but do you…
     <em>
      like
     </em>
     like me?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When Rio’s lips crash into hers, it feels like nothing could have stopped her from doing it. It’s feels– different. It’s beyond want and need. There’s a desperate urgency in the way they breathe each other in with their lips locked.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I think about you– all the time,” Rio sighs against her lips, pressing soft kisses on her mouth again and again. “I keep imagining–”
     <em>
      another kiss, “-
     </em>
     -what it would be like if you were mine. I want to–”
     <em>
      and another,
     </em>
     “know the things you like. I want to show you the things I like. And I’m scared–”
     <em>
      another, slightly longer kiss,
     </em>
     “--of how much I feel, sometimes, but– fuck, Agatha, if I have to tell you this every single day if it means I get to build something with you– I will do it.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     One hand tangles itself into Agatha’s hair, the other one slides down to her waist, careful not to touch Scratchy who is still perched on Agatha’s lap.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When Agatha locks eyes with Rio again, she feels it, she really, really feels it– the intensity with which Rio is trying to express herself. Again, she pulls her in to press their lips together, as if she’s trying to convey the rest of the message where words are just not enough. Agatha feels herself leaning in, searching for as much physical contact as she can get, letting her fingers roam over every piece of exposed skin. Her heart rate picks up as their kiss starts deepening, but Rio pulls back.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Are you going to let me continue pouring my entire soul out here on this dirty ass floor and not give me anything like ‘
     <em>
      hey, Rio, you’re kind of okay’
     </em>
     or ‘
     <em>
      there are some people who are less attractive than you’
     </em>
     or–
     <em>
      ”
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      Rio,”
     </em>
     Agatha breathes, initiating the next kiss, letting it linger for a moment. Then, she decides to be completely honest.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You told me this has always been about love for you, and about coming out for me– but– that hasn’t been true for a long time anymore.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She touches their foreheads together, eventually dipping her head down and burying her nose in Rio’s neck. “It’s like what you said months ago– this has never been about me being a lesbian. This has always been about me falling for
     <em>
      you.”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     She hears Rio’s breath hitch.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “And, well, you just happen to have a vagina.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh, do I?” Rio drawls, playfully squeezing Agatha’s side, earning her a yelp and a slap against her arm.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I believe so, yes,” Agatha says, sneaking a hand under Rio’s waistcoat, lightly scratching the skin near her ribs. She feels Rio shudder in anticipation, and is overwhelmed by an intense amount of want, an intense need to express herself, to lock her words in–
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “But I don’t think I deserve the title of lesbian enigma quite yet,” she breathes in Rio’s ear, nipping at the shell.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh– and w-why is that?” Rio asks, but she knows.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha deeply inhales against her skin, still tracing patterns with her nails, while trying to find the right words. She wants this to be
     <em>
      good,
     </em>
     she wants this to be
     <em>
      sexy–
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So she doesn’t pick any words at all. Instead, she leans back and plucks Rio’s hand from her waist, bringing it to her mouth. Without breaking eye contact, she folds three of her fingers into her palm, taking the other two into her mouth.
     <br/>
     Rio’s pupils widen as she softly sucks on her fingers, reminding them both of the last time she’d done that,
     <em>
      and why.
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Feeling emboldened by how much this affects Rio, she darts her tongue out against the fingers in her mouth, giving tiny kitten licks at the crevice between the two digits.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio groan is a delicious sound low in her throat. “How long do we have?” she rasps.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha releases her fingers with a
     <em>
      pop
     </em>
     and looks at her watch.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “If we walk back to the hotel now, we’ll have about an hour until the reception–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “But I want you
     <em>
      here, now,”
     </em>
     Rio protests. Agatha grins, trying to ignore the way her pussy responds to those words, and flicks her eyes down.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You brought him,” she says, pointing at Scratchy. “So we’ll have to bring him back first.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio groans again, but this time it’s a frustrated one. “Both my wingman and my cock blocker.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha shakes her head disapprovingly. “Are you going to keep complaining? Or are you going to let me finally taste you?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The walk back to the hotel is filled with stolen kisses and touches. Agatha’s dress is very convenient for Rio to occasionally sneak her hand under to squeeze her ass; Rio’s attire makes her body less accessible but all the more desirable.
     <br/>
     By the time they reach the elevator, Agatha has decided she wants Rio to keep the waistcoat on.
     <br/>
     She takes in Rio’s hungry look while they wait for the elevator to take them up, and she vaguely wonders if Rio would’ve pushed the emergency stop button if she wasn’t holding Scratchy.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When they enter the room, Agatha carefully but quickly puts him back in his playpen in the bathroom. She re-emerges, and grins at Rio who is already lying down on the bed, fumbling with the zipper of her pants.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Isn’t that my job?” she asks, feigning offense. She stalks towards Rio like a predatory animal and all but jumps on top of her, straddling her thighs and slapping her hands away.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “See, this is what I was talking about,” Rio says in a low voice. She contently puts her hands behind her head while Agatha works the zipper. “Total service top energy.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh, you mean I’m just more powerful than you?” Agatha mocks her, tapping the side of her ass to make her lift her hips. As she tugs the slacks down Rio’s legs, leaving her panties in place, she smiles at the apparent ease with which the two of them fall into their physical dynamic.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Sure, if that’s what you want to believe,” Rio says, kicking the pants off of her ankles. She gasps in shock when Agatha bolts forward and catches herself with her hands on both sides of Rio’s head, her face hovering just inches above her.
     <br/>
     “But I’m going to have so much fun taking you down a notch, sometime soon,” Rio whispers challengingly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Sure, if that’s what you want to believe,” Agatha mimics her, tauntingly rolling her eyes. But before Rio can respond, she drops her entire body weight on Rio and melts their lips together. Finally,
     <em>
      finally
     </em>
     she feels Rio’s tongue slide against hers again. She savours the taste of her mouth like an appetizer in anticipation of what she will taste like between her legs.
     <br/>
     Their bodies slide against each other while they keep drinking each other in; hands touching and feeling and squeezing and pushing and pulling, already looking for more friction, but Rio soon warns Agatha to take her dress off if she still wants to be able to wear it to the reception. Agatha complies, but makes a mental note to let Rio rip a different piece of clothing apart in the future.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Fuck!” Rio yells out loudly when Agatha’s breasts are exposed. It startles her a little, and she looks at her questioningly, but Rio has covered her face in her hands. She peeks through her fingers, and drops her hands again.
     <br/>
     “I keep forgetting how fucking perfect your boobs are and how badly I just want to– fuck, come here,” she growls, pulling Agatha in by her upper body.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When Rio takes a pebbled nipple into her mouth, Agatha’s chuckle is so low it sounds almost mean.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Why do I get the feeling you’ve been holding yourself back when we did this for the first time?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh, you have no idea.” It’s a pained, muffled sound against her skin. Agatha gasps when greedy fingers start massaging the unattended breast. “The
     <em>
      things
     </em>
     I wanted to do to you– and still want to do,” Rio sighs, teasingly scraping her teeth against the nipple. “But you deserve– patience, care, attention–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “--and your tongue on my clit,
     <em>
      now,”
     </em>
     Agatha interrupts her with a growl, unable to stay composed while Rio is saying and doing the most delicious things to her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio lightly swats her ass to send her in the desired direction, but it makes Agatha moan– they lock eyes, and Rio cocks a mischievous eyebrow before Agatha shifts her body forward until her knees are on both sides of Rio’s head. She realizes she’s still wearing her panties, but Rio reaches up and pulls them to the side before she can even think about taking them off.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Come on, show me how it’s done again,” she whispers hotly before lowering herself onto Rio’s face. She laughs in ecstasy when she immediately feels Rio’s tongue swipe through her wet slit– because of her own confidence in comparison to the first time they’d done this, and because of how much Rio wants her, just skipping the teasing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      Yes,”
     </em>
     she sighs as Rio starts circling her clit with her skilled tongue. Agatha slides her hands down in Rio’s hair, grabbing two fistfuls right away, reveling in the groan that draws out of Rio. The sound is followed by a moan of her own when Rio’s hands land back on her ass, squeezing tightly, pressing her nails in and soothing the indents by rubbing the skin immediately after.
     <br/>
     Agatha realizes the attention to her ass makes her grind down on Rio’s face harder, and before she can wonder if Rio notices it too, she feels another slap against her left ass cheek.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A mewl escapes her, and when she looks down, she stifles another moan at the burning desire in the eyes looking up at her from between her thighs.
     <em>
      Oh,
     </em>
     how much she wants this woman. How much she loves how in tune they are.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     For a moment, she wants to pretend it doesn’t affect her, but what comes out of her mouth is a hissed command: “
     <em>
      Again.”
     </em>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio’s palm lands on her right ass cheek with an audible smack this time. Agatha would’ve never thought she’d like this, which is what makes it that much hotter because it spurs her on to shamelessly take her own pleasure from Rio– who’s more than willingly offering.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     It doesn’t take long for them to find the perfect angle and rhythm to bring Agatha higher and higher, and when she feels herself getting close she releases her grip from Rio’s hair to lean back, placing both hands on Rio’s thighs, giving her even more leverage to fuck her face.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Everything around them disappears and she can’t distinguish Rio’s moans from her own anymore. The fact that Rio seems to be enjoying this just as much as she is, makes her pleasure even more intense.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m coming,
     <em>
      I’m coming,
     </em>
     fuck, Rio, I’m gonna come,” she whimpers, almost making it sound like a prayer. The last thing she sees before she loses her vision, is Rio’s eyes rolling back too.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Her orgasm doesn’t feel like one big explosion, but rather like a million little ones, sending her over the edge over and over again as she rides them out on Rio’s nose and tongue. She doesn’t have time to catch her breath once the last bit of her climax is squeezed from her, because Rio nearly throws her off and flips her onto her back, diving in to attack her mouth with her own.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Holy fucking hell,” Rio groans while sucking and nipping at Agatha’s lips, who doesn’t quite have the strength yet to kiss her back with the same intensity. “Fuck, fuck,
     <em>
      ffffuck,”
     </em>
     she manages, unintentionally driving her hips into Agatha’s. “How the fuck are you so
     <em>
      fucking– hot? Jesus christ– you are– you are– fuck,
     </em>
     I want you, Agatha, I want you so fucking badly.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Not able to bring up the patience for Agatha’s recovery, she straddles one of her thighs and starts rocking her core against it in a steady rhythm.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Hey,” Agatha protests weakly. “Stop that. ‘Smy job.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh yeah?” Rio challenges her, not letting up, “so come get it.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     As it turns out, Agatha
     <em>
      does
     </em>
     have the strength to push herself up and roll them over again.
     <br/>
     Rio whines at the loss of friction against her pussy, but when Agatha positions herself in between Rio’s legs, she soothes her by scraping her nails along the inside of her thigh.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     While she lowers her mouth to lavishly pay attention to Rio’s nipples, her hand slides tentatively up to her core, hooking her fingers in the waistband of her panties to feel around for how badly she wants her. Rio has always been wet long before Agatha’s fingers could slide through her folds to feel for herself, but it’s even worse this time– as soon as she touches her, the slickness starts dribbling down her fingers and she can feel her pulse and clench around nothing.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Insatiable,” she teases, sucking long and hard on a nipple, making Rio’ back arch.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Which you love to remind me is your job now,” Rio strains. “So are you going to get to work or what?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Somewhere in the back of her mind, Agatha’s reservations about putting her mouth between Rio’s legs are still there. But her curiosity, her flaming desire, and most of all; her urgent need to taste her and make her feel good are much, much more present.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Without thinking, she lifts the fingers that had been buried in Rio’s wetness to her own mouth, and sticks her tongue out to lap up her taste, unintentionally giving Rio a show. She only realizes the pornographic gesture when she hears Rio’s breath pick up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Taking the time to really taste her, she realizes it’s pretty comparable to her own, except there’s a deep, heady touch of pure
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     to it.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You could’ve told me you’re this delicious, you know,” she says while snobbishly raising her eyebrows, giving her fingers another lick for good measure.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “If you already like
     <em>
      that,
     </em>
     you should taste it from the source,” Rio says breathlessly, making no effort to hide how turned on she is and pushing her own panties down over her hips until she can kick them off.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha crawls further down the bed, lining her face up with Rio’s mound. “I wish I would’ve thought of that,” she murmurs against a hipbone, eventually grazing it with her teeth.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     While slowly kissing her way towards the patch of short hairs above the pubic bone, she feels one of Rio’s hands slide into her hair. She pauses for a brief moment, deciding whether she likes that or not– but when she feels nails digging into her scalp, it causes a shiver to run down her spine. Yes. Yes, she likes it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hovering inches above her pussy, Agatha gets overwhelmed by the smell of Rio’s arousal. It draws her in like on instinct; her eyes glued to the glistening folds. Mesmerized, Agatha lowers herself down on her chest, leans on her elbows, and uses both thumbs to spread Rio open and pull the skin up, exposing her clit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Please,” she hears a desperate whimper, and only now she realizes that Rio is shaking under her touch.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The scent gets even stronger, and before one of them can actually go insane, she flicks her tongue at the small, pulsing bundle of nerves. Rio starts panting even faster, breathing heavily through her nose.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She does it again, reveling in the jolt of Rio’s body when her tongue makes contact– and again. The next time, she stays there, enveloping her clit completely with her lips, sucking softly.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh
     <em>
      shit!”
     </em>
     Rio’s hips buck up wildly, making Agatha lose her grip. “No, no, come back,” she begs, guiding her back between her legs by her hair. Agatha grins as she lets her mouth and nose be pressed into Rio’s core, and this time she takes a long swipe from her entrance to her clit, taking everything she has to offer.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Her senses get completely overrun by Rio,
     <em>
      Rio, Rio.
     </em>
     There’s something about being allowed to be this close to her, to experience the most intimate part of her. It’s a privilege to taste her like this, to smell her– to draw the most delicious sounds out of her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Taking a page out of Rio’s book, her tongue starts exploring. She wants to find the exact spots and the exact movements that set her off the most, just like Rio always does to her. Soon she finds out that circling her clit makes her moan; flicking it makes her gasp; sliding down to her entrance makes her swear and tighten the grip in her hair. She can’t decide which one of these reactions she loves the most, so she keeps switching between them, turning Rio into a whimpering mess.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     That is, until she realizes she doesn’t need her fingers anymore to spread her open – burying her own face and tongue in Rio’s cunt gives her all the access she needs – and so she frees up one hand. She brings it up under her chin, and carefully starts teasing around her entrance with one finger, while focussing her mouth fully on her clit.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The sound Rio makes when she enters her and curls her finger, makes a wave of euphoria wash over her. She wonders how it’s possible to feel this ecstatic by making someone else feel good– there’s nothing she’s ever felt that can compare to this feeling. And so she doubles her efforts: sucking and licking Rio’s clit, while curling her finger against the spot she knows will make Rio come apart.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh god, oh god,
     <em>
      oh god,”
     </em>
     Rio breathes, making Agatha feel more proud with every word she utters. “Right there–
     <em>
      fuck yes
     </em>
     –”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio comes with a cry and her back arches again. Her eyes are squeezed shut and her hand releases Agatha’s hair to tightly squeeze the bed sheets, whitening her knuckles. Agatha keeps licking and fucking her through it, until she starts squirming.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In a final moment of confidence, Agatha slides her finger out and sucks it into her own mouth again for Rio’s viewing pleasure.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “This might be my new favorite thing to do,” she says around her finger, releasing it with a sharp sucking sound and crawling up to look a spent Rio in the eyes.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You should get a taste too,” she says, lowering her mouth onto Rio’s and pouring every bit of affection she feels into the kiss, making Rio breathe out a satisfied sigh around her tongue. She feels Rio arms being wrapped around her neck, and she lets herself get pulled in, eventually dropping her body onto Rio’s and her face in her neck.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Just to double check,” Rio mumbles weakly. “You did agree to date me, yeah? Because I might cry if this is the last time we’re ever doing this.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha chuckles against her skin and presses a soft kiss beneath her ear. “Depends– what does dating mean in your opinion? Are we going out? Are we exclusive? Are we– in a relationship? Or are you asking me to get m–” Her eyes widen. “--married. Fuck, Rio, the reception! What time is it?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You’re the one wearing a watch.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Fuck. Yeah. Wait. Let me check.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha reluctantly rolls off of her and checks the time. “Shit, shit shit! Why does this keep happening to us? We have to
     <em>
      go!”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Frantically looking around for her dress, she watches Rio lazily arise from the bed. “Hurry!” she presses.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah, I heard you,” Rio sighs. “I’ll shower first–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No time! We have to go, like,
     <em>
      right now.”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     “Oh shit,” Rio eventually says when she realizes in
     <em>
      how much
     </em>
     of a hurry they are.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha pulls her dress over her head and down her body while she watches Rio look around for her panties. When she finds them and is about to put them on, something in Agatha’s mind clicks.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “
     <em>
      Wait.”
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Rio looks up. “Aren't we in a rush?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yes,” Agatha nods, while walking over to Rio on the bed. “But still. Wait.”
     <br/>
     She plucks the panties from Rio’s hand, takes a second to notice how cold and wet they are, and she shakes her head.
     <br/>
     “Actually, no. I’ll let you borrow mine,” she says, while chucking Rio’s panties into a corner of the room and finding a set of clean ones in her dresser. Still confused, Rio follows her every move.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “C’mere,” Agatha says, walking back to the bed. Before Rio can stop her, Agatha has already put Rio’s legs through the holes, now sliding them up to her hips. Next, she extends a hand for Rio to grab and pulls her up into a standing position. Not letting go of her hand, Agatha takes the blue slacks off the floor, and stands back up to press a short, sweet kiss on Rio’s lips. Then, she crouches down again, tapping one of Rio’s ankles.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Up,” she says, and Rio dumbly complies, lifting her foot and letting it be guided into her pant leg. The other one follows, and Agatha continues shimmying the pants up Rio’s legs and over her hips. By the time she closes the zipper and the button, their bodies are nearly flush again.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You remembered,” Rio whispers when Agatha looks up and into her eyes. She looks impressed and like she’s about to cry at the same time.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Of course I remembered,” Agatha laughs breathlessly. “The image never left my mind.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Who knew you’d be such a hopeless romantic,” Rio teases her, while cupping her cheek.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Romantic, yes. Hopeless, no,” Agatha fires back. “And if we had more time, this moment would be less awkward, but we really,
     <em>
      really
     </em>
     have to go.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They quickly move on to checking themselves in the mirror– their hair is a mess, but there’s nothing they can do about it now. Their clothes are wrinkled, but at least they can take a minute to get rid of any makeup stains on their face before leaving the hotel room and running back to the outside location where the ceremony had been that afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     Both slightly out of breath, they arrive to see the rows of chairs had been moved around into a dinner setup, all the guests already on their designated chairs. Their blood runs cold when they see Jen and Alice standing at the gazebo, microphone in hand.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “--not sure where they are, but they should be somewhere around here,” they hear Jen say, shielding her eyes with a hand to search for the two women who had only just arrived.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh! There you are! Agatha, Rio, speech time,” she says excitedly, and the guests start politely applauding.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Slowly, Agatha and Rio turn toward each other, having a silent conversation in their panicked expression.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      Fuck.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      The speeches.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      Did you–?
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      No.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      Me neither.
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     Within a fraction of a second, Agatha makes a decision. She pulls Rio towards the gazebo and snatches the microphone from Jen’s hand, motioning for the brides to take their seats.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Hi everyone,” Agatha says to the guests. “I’m sure everyone remembers me– the surprise act at the engagement party of our lovely brides here.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     A few people chuckle, and Jen and Alice exchange knowing smiles– smiles that have nothing to do with what Agatha’s saying, but rather the state both she and Rio are in.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Sorry we’re late,” she continues, watching Rio from the corner of her eye. “But we had some business to attend to. Business that we need to dedicate to Jen and Alice. Eh–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha takes a deep breath. “We’re–
     <em>
      we are
     </em>
     the business.” She motions at Rio with her thumb, and tries to ignore the jaw drop. “And Alice and Jen– they knew. When they chose us to be their maid of honor and best man, they knew they were signing us and each other up for a lot of trouble, but mostly for something… more.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Looking at Rio again, who seems to have stopped breathing, she smiles and takes her hand. “And I think that is the thing we want everyone to know about my best friend Jen, and Rio’s best friend Alice. During one of the biggest events of their lives, they put a lot of effort and love into creating space for something they knew would be good for us, something they saw way ahead of us and something they wanted to nurture and grow. It speaks of their unrelenting and stable love; not only for each other, but for their friends.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There’s a restless murmur in the audience, and she watches Alice slide her hand over Jen’s knee. Then, Rio takes the microphone from her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “The way they were willing to put their own wedding at risk to feed something they believed in, is what makes them the most deserving humans of an unforgettable wedding ever. I’m sure we’re not the only ones who have been on the receiving end of their scheming, and ultimately, their love, so we want to invite you all to take the time tonight to let them know– how important they are to you. How indispensable. And how we all wish them the luckiest, happiest, best marriage they could possibly think of.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     While the guests start applauding and cheering again, Agatha takes over the mic one more time.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I hate you Jen. But I love you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio leans in: “And Al– I’m coming for you. But first– let’s party.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The music gets turned up, giving Jen and Alice the opportunity to walk up to their friends while the guests dig into their dinner.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So– you showed up late to take care of
     <em>
      business?”
     </em>
     Jen smirks. She points at the corner of her mouth. “You’ve got something–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Don’t make me tell them something embarrassing about you again,” Agatha warns her. Next to them, Alice envelops Rio in a tight hug.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “What does it mean?” she carefully asks them. Rio and Agatha exchange a look.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighs. “It means she finally gets what she wants,” she says jokingly, nodding at Rio.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “It means you won’t want to be around us for the next two months,” Rio adds with a smirk.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Nothing scares us anymore, honey,” Jen deadpans. “You desensitized us on the first night.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Are you sure?” Rio muses, mischievously bringing her hand to Agatha’s lower back and slowly sliding it down to her thighs. “Because I think I just found a button that makes her–”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No thank you–”
     <br/>
     “--Hey!” Both Jen and Agatha respond in shock. Agatha elbows Rio in the stomach. Rio squeezes her ass in response.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I see how it is,” Alice smiles. “Enjoy your honeymoon, ladies. We’ll do the same.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The four of them sit down to join the rest of the guests for dinner, while excitedly talking about the wedding and the budding new relationship. Slowly but surely, Agatha feels herself relax as she’s being freed of her secrets and her humiliation. And when Rio eventually takes her hand to pull her towards the dance floor, Agatha feels proud instead of ashamed. She wants everyone to see that this gorgeous woman chooses
     <em>
      her.
     </em>
     It’s like Rio had said months ago: she doesn’t mind everyone knowing she’s a lesbian, as long as it means she gets the privilege of having these kinds of feelings for
     <em>
      her.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     At some point during the night, a few hours of dancing and laughing later, Jen has clearly had one glass of wine too many when she interrupts an intimate moment between Agatha and Rio by throwing herself in between them. She hides something behind her back when she starts cheering in Agatha’s face.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m
     <em>
      so happy!”
     </em>
     she yells. “I love you so much, Agatha, and now that Rio has finally convinced you, I just know you will be happy too.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She whips out a piece of pink, orange and white fabric from behind her back– Agatha needs a few seconds to realize it’s the lesbian flag.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Come here!” Jen shouts, draping the flag over Agatha’s shoulder and using it to pull her in for a hug. Rio hides a chuckle in her hand when she watches Agatha’s horrified expression.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Thanks Jen,” she coughs, trying to wiggle herself loose from the tight hug, but she doesn’t let go. “Alright, that’s enough dear.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When she feels a possessive hand on her waist prying her from Jen’s death grip, she’s actually grateful.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m gonna need to steal her for another moment,” Rio says, friendly in the way one would talk to a drunk person.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “No, wait–” Jen says, but Rio is already guiding Agatha away from her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I think I just heard Alice call out for you!” Rio says, pointing in the opposite direction.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I heard it too,” Agatha nods. When Jen turns around to look, Rio tugs on Agatha’s hand to run away together.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They come to a stop in front of the gazebo, both laughing and out of breath.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Thanks,” Agatha smirks. “That would’ve gone on forever.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh, I didn’t do that for
     <em>
      you,”
     </em>
     Rio says. “I like having you to myself.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     "Possessive much? I’d be careful putting a claim on me if I were you,” Agatha says, crossing her arms and raising an eyebrow.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio huffs and steps closer. “Too late. I already did,” she says, lifting her arm and pointing at her wrist.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     When Agatha realizes what she’s talking about–
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Shit! The bracelet!” she says. “I think I brought it to the room with us. I probably left it there.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Would you have wanted to wear it?” Rio carefully inquires.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha purses her lips, pretending to think about it. “I mean… if you’d ask nicely, sure.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Good thing I did bring it when we left the room.” With a sparkle in her eyes, Rio shoves her hand in her pocket and pulls out the green bracelet. Agatha laughs, again, at Rio’s thoughtfulness.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So– Agatha,” Rio says, lowering her voice and stepping even closer, their faces inches from each other now. She theatrically clears her throat before asking: “Will you– wear this bracelet?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha’s lips curve up into a soft smile. She knows this isn’t about the bracelet, but about much more than that. For the hundredth time, she feels herself getting weak for the woman in front of her. She considers the adventure Rio is offering her – a shot at a new, different life – but she doesn’t have to think about her answer for long. This, right here, right now, feels like the perfect moment to take the leap.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Lovingly cupping Rio’s cheek in one hand and pressing their lips together – their first kiss in public – she offers up her wrist when she leans back.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m still scared. But I want this. With you, Rio. Let’s do this.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio smiles at her like she’d just made her the happiest woman in the world. And when Rio carefully ties the bracelet around Agatha’s wrist, neither of them realize that just like that, their fates are sealed.
    </p>
    <p>
     And in that moment, neither of them realize that this is how their story was always supposed to go. Not now, not when they leave Mexico together, and not when, after several dates back home, Agatha wakes up in the middle of the night, panicking, and violently shaking Rio awake to ask her if she’s her
     <em>
      girlfriend,
     </em>
     and when Rio says yes, she bursts out crying.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     For weeks, months, they don’t realize the amount of magic they keep creating out of love.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     There are fights, obviously, but Rio soon realizes that their love is stronger than their stubborn personalities– she knows she will always,
     <em>
      always
     </em>
     choose Agatha.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And one day, when Rio reads the same truth in Agatha’s eyes and tells her she loves her for the first time– Agatha can’t say it back right away, but Rio receives multiple phone calls throughout the following week in which Agatha can’t stop telling her how much she loves her.
     <br/>
     Not unlike how she can’t stop tasting her, ever since that first time.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha occasionally even flips their positions and teaches Rio new things– about love, relationships, or in bed. But when, after a few more months, they move in together and the U-haul jokes have lost their novelty, it’s Rio who steps up and starts mowing the lawn.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Neither of them realize they keep rewriting their own principles, over and over again. Though the irony isn’t completely lost on Agatha when Rio goes to Switzerland again for work, and despite neither of them being big fans of the concept of marriage, she finds herself taking a plane to Zurich a few weeks later with a ring burning a hole in her pocket– because she just
     <em>
      can’t stand
     </em>
     the idea of another day going by and not asking her.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Of course, their maid of honor and best man are the first thing they agree on. And when Jen and Alice accept, no one is surprised when, during their surprise engagement party, they tell the story of their friends’ ear-shatteringly loud nights in Mexico.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     That is how eventually, Jen’s anti-wedding maid of honor wears a crisp white wedding suit, with Alice’s anti-wedding best man a sleek white wedding dress, back at the same hotel where it all started.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Señor Scratchy bringing them the rings is Rio’s idea, of course, but the outrageous wedding decorations are all Jen and Alice.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     In her vows, Agatha drags herself through the mud one last time by reading
     <em>
      that text
     </em>
     out loud in front of everybody, earning herself a few laughs from the guests and the biggest grin from her fiancée– and she promises Rio to be the opposite of whatever message that text had conveyed.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     So maybe,
     <em>
      just maybe,
     </em>
     they finally do realize what this moment, with Rio finishing up tying the bracelet around Agatha’s wrist and pressing a loving kiss to it, had always meant when they, two years later but in this exact same spot, stand across from each other, exchanging a little more than just a bracelet.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And so they tell each other.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <em>
      I do, my love. I do.
     </em>

    <p>
     No matter how long Jennifer Kale stares at that prominent rock on Agatha’s finger, every time she realizes what it means, she needs to pinch herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     She imagines Alice experiences the same when looking at the ring finger of Rio’s left hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Four years have passed since all four of them had arrived at this Mexican hotel for the first time. Jen and Alice to celebrate their love and get married— Agatha and Rio to annoy each other to tears and eventually tear each other apart under the covers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Three years have passed since Agatha and Rio had announced their engagement to Jen and Alice, who had just about passed out at the news and then made it their life’s work to embarrass their friends just as much as they had embarrassed them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Two years have passed since here, in this very same hotel, Agatha and Rio had told each other ‘I do’, and thus finally, officially convinced Jen that their relationship wasn’t just a prank that had gotten out of hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Five minutes have passed since Jen had started to wonder whether the exponential growth of Agatha and Rio’s relationship had eventually been coming to an end.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     It had seemed like a great idea; to come back to this hotel to reminisce, to bring back memories, to celebrate their love once more.
    </p>
    <p>
     But Agatha hadn’t seemed like herself all week, acting crabby—well, even more crabby than usual—and generally uninterested. Jen had assumed it was just a rough patch at first, but Rio’s behavior had been strangely out of character as well.
    </p>
    <p>
     And now that the four of them are sharing a dinner table looking out over the lush garden at the back of the hotel, Jen even starts to wonder whether she should be
     <em>
      concerned
     </em>
     when she sees a faint, red mark on Agatha’s swollen right cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio would never… would she?
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen had brought up her observations to Alice earlier, who had reminded her in four different sentence structures that Agatha and Rio’s relationship was
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     her metaphorical circus, and Agatha and Rio were therefore
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     her metaphorical monkeys.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, Alice hadn’t married Jen for her extraordinary ability to keep a lid on her curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her two friends across the table might not be her monkeys, but it is her goddamn right to buy a ticket to the circus.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her admission time happens to be right around the moment Agatha scrunches up her nose at the food in front of her, twirling her fork between her fingers absentmindedly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How are we feeling on our last night here, ladies?” Jen says breezily while cutting into her steak. “I know I’m not looking forward to going back home.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, this was really great.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Had an amazing time.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Their non-committal answers make her sigh and sit back. “You two need margaritas,” Jen declares, pointing at them with her knife. Jen feels her wife’s calming hand on her knee, but flags the server down anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hola,” she says with a strong American lilt, “cuatro marg—“
    </p>
    <p>
     “Actually, a diet coke for me please,” Agatha interrupts her, to the waiter who understands English perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And for me as well,” Rio adds.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen presses her lips together. “Well, make that
     <em>
      dos
     </em>
     margaritas and
     <em>
      dos
     </em>
     boring diet cokes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The server smiles and nods politely, before making his way to the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen doesn’t even realize she is slowly losing her patience when she feels Alice’s grip on her knee tighten.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, drop the act,” Jen releases her cutlery and it loudly clatters onto her plate. “Babe,” Alice shushes her softly, but she might as well have said it to the waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What the
     <em>
      hell
     </em>
     is going on here? You two were acting like this last year, and you just ended up needing a good ol’ roll in the hay. So why haven’t you, I don’t know, been railing each other stupid? You certainly didn’t have a problem with that early on, when you were desperately trying to keep your nightly escapades a secret, sounding like you were trying to communicate with a
     <em>
      whale colony—”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Menopause,” Agatha provides stoically, while at the same time Rio says: “A pod.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The waiter approaches and puts four drinks on the table, giving Jen some time to process.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?” she says to Agatha, slightly confused. “
     <em>
      What?!”
     </em>
     she then says to Rio in the same breath, utterly bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Vaginal dryness,” Agatha barks, while again simultaneously Rio says: “A group of whales is called a pod.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen exhales through her nose and is secretly thankful the waiter’s English isn’t
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     good, though judging by the startled look in his eyes, ‘
     <em>
      vaginal’
     </em>
     seems to be somewhat universal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just as she wants to lash out at the two idiots across the table again, Alice interrupts her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’ve been going through menopause for a hot second,” she says empathically, giving Jen’s thigh another warning squeeze under the table. “I’m so sorry to hear it’s still that bad.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice deserves a medal for the calm and friendly way she phrases that sentence as opposed to the accusing and somewhat aggressive way Jen would’ve stated the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     Unfortunately, it doesn’t help to improve the mood at all.
    </p>
    <p>
     On the contrary; the sound of cutlery against plates increases in volume as to emphasize the lack of conversation. And only Jen and Alice’s at that— both Agatha and Rio are still staring at their paella as if it had personally offended them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen’s patience finally snaps when, upon a seemingly innocent move Rio makes to brush her hand against Agatha’s, Agatha pulls away and stares in the opposite direction.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m calling it a night,” Jen declares, loudly scraping her chair backward. “Agatha, can I talk to you for a sec?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m actually good,” her friend says. “I’m going to bed too.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen gapes at her when Agatha gets up and leaves without another word. After she’s disappeared from view, Jen turns to Rio: “If she hadn’t been complaining about menopause the whole time, I’d accuse you of getting her pregnant.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio scoffs. “I’d have rented out a nuclear bunker for nine months.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “For her or for you?” Alice asks, happily jumping on the opportunity to bring some lightness into the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes,” Rio answers without missing a single beat.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen considers herself the luckiest wife in the universe when that night, Alice manages to distract her so well that she can’t think of anything besides
     <em>
      please, don’t stop
     </em>
     and
     <em>
      yes, right there.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     They're back at the same place where their wedding night happened, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Frankly, she is only able to enjoy mere minutes of her own concerns being fucked out of her system, when she hears a sound from the next room over— Agatha and Rio’s.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What was that?” Jen shoots up, now wide awake after almost having fallen asleep against Alice’s comfortable chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mhuh?” Alice provides eloquently, startled by the sudden movements of her wife.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I thought I heard a
     <em>
      bang
     </em>
     or something, coming from Agatha and Rio’s room…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Both women keep quiet to listen for a few seconds, but only the faint music of a party happening downstairs breezes lightly through the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sure it’s nuffin,” Alice says sleepily, motioning for Jen to snuggle back into her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen has no choice but to agree, but as she lowers herself back onto the mattress—
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      OH MY GOD!”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen shoots right back up, spine ramrod straight. “That was Rio, wasn’t it?” She looks down at her wife, whose eyes are now blinking open.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think so,” Alice says. “But—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      FUCK!”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “That was Agatha,” Jen presses. She feels her senses sharpen.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m sure they’re—” Alice gets interrupted by a loud
     <em>
      thump
     </em>
     against their shared wall.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen’s heart rate picks up as she nervously locks eyes with Alice. “Are they fighting?” she whispers. “Or are they—”
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “FUCK! YES!”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fucking,” Alice helpfully adds.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh no,” Jen groans, dropping her face into her hands. “We haven’t heard them all week, and
     <em>
      now
     </em>
     they’re gonna keep us up?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You don’t have to listen to them,” Alice says, placing a calm hand on Jen’s arm. “Just zone them out.”
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “OH, FUCK! RIO! YES, BABY, YES!”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen’s expression drops, now glaring at her wife. “You can zone
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     out? Good fucking luck.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice reluctantly groans in agreement. A rhythmic
     <em>
      thump, thump, thump
     </em>
     against the wall has them both furrow their brows at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I’m sure it won’t last long,” Alice tries to sound hopeful, but Jen shoots her a look.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can’t convince me you honestly believe that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Since she has no choice but to give in, Jen plops back down onto her back, half heartedly covering her ears to drown out the noise as Alice tries to comfort her by softly stroking along her ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “HARDER, AGATHA! FASTER, DEEPER!”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh my
     <em>
      goood,”
     </em>
     Jen elongates the word, “this isn’t
     <em>
      happening.”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Maybe look at it from the bright side,” Alice whispers in between
     <em>
      thumps.
     </em>
     “You were concerned about them, about their sex life. At least you can let that go.”
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “MY CLIT, MY CLIT! OH, YES! I’M GONNA COME, I’M GONNA COME!”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Whoop-dee-doo,” Jen deadpans, not so sure if this is a better alternative. She pushes herself up again to glare at the wall, and before she can help herself, she yells: “If you need help finding it, just text me!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Babe!” Alice calls out in a surprised chuckle. “You can’t do that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Watch me,” Jen bristles as the pace of the
     <em>
      thump thump thump-
     </em>
     ing increases.
    </p>
    <p>
     “

     “Hurry the fuck uuuuuup,” Jen shouts back in the same tone. “Some people are trying to sleeeeep.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Honey,” Alice attempts to berate her, but giggles instead. When she opens her mouth to attempt to calm her wife, either Agatha or Rio seems to be reaching undiscovered heights and frying their vocal chords in the process; even Alice covers her ears until the roar has died down.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh god. It’s over,” Jen breathes in relief after several minutes of silence. “Survived The Scandal of ‘28.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice hums in agreement as her wife settles back in against her chest. “Sweet dreams, my love.”

     “Sweet dreams, my—”

     “That’s it,” Jen decides, folding the covers open like a woman on a mission.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What are you doing?” Alice asks, half in confusion and half in concern.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This can’t go on,” Jen states, marching for the door. “I’m stopping this. You coming or not?”

     Alice is a peacekeeper, she knows that. Alice is the good cop. The softie. Has a doctorate in conflict avoidance.

     It surprises absolutely nobody when Rio, dragging not one but
     <em>
      two
     </em>
     small wheeled suitcases along, and Agatha, balancing a venti caramel macchiato in one hand and trying to work the lid on top of it with the other, all while while speedwalking behind her wife, approach the gate about fifteen whole seconds before it closes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mrs. and Mrs. Vidal?” the flight attendant assumes even before accepting their passports, both of which Rio hastily fishes from the inner pocket of her jean jacket.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I
     <em>
      told
     </em>
     you I can carry my own bag,” Agatha says bitterly and slightly out of breath, finally having secured the lid on her cup. She snatches one of the handles and demonstratively tugs her suitcase closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was trying to get us here
     <em>
      on time,”
     </em>
     Rio says pointedly, slipping her passport back into her jacket.
    </p>
    <p>
     “To be early is to be on time. To be on time is to be late,” the flight attendant provides with a half patronizing, half amused smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha haughtily sticks her nose up in the air: “A queen is never—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Babe, I swear to god, you’re not going to quote
     <em>
      The Princess Diaries
     </em>
     while an entire plane full of people is waiting for us.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha huffs and blinks at the flight attendant who is trying to hand her own passport back to her. She reminds herself how she’d
     <em>
      just
     </em>
     told her wife that she could be responsible for her own belongings, so she snatches it from the manicured hand and stands, looking a bit lost with her coffee in her left hand and her travel document in her right, just like a modern version of Lady Justicia.
    </p>
    <p>
     She’s just about to put her passport away as she realizes her purse dangles from her opposite shoulder, so she slams the passport to her chest and clamps it with her chin to be able to hovel her caramel macchiato over into her other hand. The moment her chin slams down however, she winces, yelps loudly, and drops both her passport and her drink on the floor— and the lid proves absolutely useless.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Fuck me!”
     </em>
     Agatha curses loudly, while Rio drags a slow hand down her face in shame.
    </p>
    <p>
     And because Agatha absolutely thrives in stressful situations, she crouches down to pick up her dripping passport from the floor, face twisting awkwardly while looking around in search of something that can function as a paper towel, before making a move to mop up the coffee with her already soiled passport.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s okay, Mrs. Vidal!” the flight attendant quickly interrupts her. “We’ll get that taken care of. Please make your way to the aircraft.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha
     <em>
      uhms
     </em>
     and
     <em>
      ahs
     </em>
     her way back up, meekly following a head-shaking Rio who has already started the trek down the loading bridge, looking one minor inconvenience away from dropping to the floor and sobbing into the dirty airport carpet; both on their way to what is supposed to be a relaxing and stress-free holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “So I take it you had that tooth checked out?” Rio murmurs into Agatha’s ear, one hour into the flight, blood pressure down to a reasonable level, apparently feeling civil enough to emphasize the good intention behind her question by planting a soft kiss to Agatha’s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     It earns her a deadly side eye.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes?” Rio says surprisedly, raising one questioning eyebrow.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Stop it,” Agatha warns her, popping an airpod into the ear on Rio’s side. Her world is peaceful for one full breath, and then she feels Rio’s finger lightly tapping against her left jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ow!” Agatha winces again, ripping the airpod out. “The hell was that for?!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “To prove two things,” Rio says, a winning smile on her face, counting the facts on her fingers. “One; you’re a horrible liar. Two; you’re a little baby. A little adult baby of postmenopausal age who’s still afraid to go to the—
     <em>
      ow!”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha squeezes Rio’s cheeks with one determined hand, her grip so firm her face puffs up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Keep that up, Vidal, and the first one of us with a dentist appointment is gonna be you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Copy that, chief,” Rio manages by moving just her lips, looking like a fish.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good boy,” Agatha grins, pressing a loving kiss to Rio’s plumped up lips before releasing her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turns her attention back to her Switch, but not before shyly muttering: “You know I like it when you talk to me like that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha laughs breathily at how horny Rio once again proves to be, flipping the cover of her ereader. “
     <em>
      You
     </em>
     know I will talk to you like that all night if I feel like it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lets out a pained groan and shifts uncomfortably in her seat. “We there yet?”
    </p>
    <p>
     After flicking her wrist to look at her watch, Agatha does some quick math in her head: “With a little bit of luck, if customs and baggage claim take less than twenty minutes, the engine of the taxi is already running, and the hotel reception has our room key ready on the desk… I can have your tongue in my cunt in about five hours and fifteen minutes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Right as Agatha finishes her sentence, a flight attendant hands Rio two bottles of water, which she accepts with a very wide, very fake smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “If it takes anything more than five and a half hours,” she hisses through her teeth, “I’m going down on you in the backseat of that taxi.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     While it regrettably takes them a little over six hours to get to their hotel room from that moment on, Rio does manage to wait until after the door has locked behind them before commanding Agatha to
     <em>
      get on the bed, now.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She had already figured out how horny Rio was when her wife had snatched her phone from her hands in the taxi, had opened the notes app, and had typed ‘
     <em>
      I think I can smell your pussy from here’.
     </em>
     From the moment Agatha had received her phone back, accompanied by an outright starved look from Rio, she had been somewhere between sticky and dangerously inflammable.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What if I don’t want to?” Agatha challenges her in a sultry voice, tracing her index finger down Rio’s sternum. “You gonna
     <em>
      make me?”
     </em>
     she says mockingly, over articulating the last two words and rolling her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I should,” Rio says while grabbing two handfuls of ass to pull their hips flush. She sighs in relief; Agatha lets out a surprised groan. “You’re fucking impossible to travel with.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha places her palms against her wife’s collarbones to lean her upper body back: “Am I?” she questions, a clear warning in her voice. She feels her stomach flip at the mischievous glint in Rio’s eyes, and a growl in her throat when Rio nods with her tongue pressed against the inside of her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Such a diva,” Rio doubles down dramatically. “I can’t believe you let me carry your suitcase.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s jaw drops in offense. “What?! I
     <em>
      said
     </em>
     that I would— oh, fuck you, Vidal,” she says as her wife starts chuckling breathily.
    </p>
    <p>
     She leans back in and briefly takes Rio’s earlobe in her mouth before whispering: “You’re being a bit of a bad boy right now.” Rio’s grip on her ass tightens. “But it’s not too late to turn into a good girl.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio practically turns into goo right there in her arms, but has the presence of mind to take a few steps back just in time to let the bed soften her fall. Before Agatha can instruct her, she is already pulling her shirt over her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So you
     <em>
      are
     </em>
     well-trained,” Agatha quips before shamelessly stepping out of her shoes, shorts, and underwear, putting herself on full display in front of her nearly salivating wife.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, now bare-chested, drops onto her back while Agatha straddles her thighs, undoing the buttons of her shirt one by one. Rio licks her lips when it reveals a strapless bra.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wait,” she husks, working one hand under Agatha’s shirt to undo her bra with a quick flick. She grabs it by a cup and hurls it away, landing on one of their unpacked suitcases. “Leave this on,” Rio all but whines, tugging on both sides of Agatha’s open shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, what’s this?” Agatha drawls in fake surprise. “I didn’t realize you’d prefer the professor look on me today.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio groans and bucks her hips up in search of friction. “Can you put on those glasses?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha grins as she leans over, peppering Rio’s stomach with sweet little kisses, stroking the soft skin with her thumbs. “Sorry sweetheart,” she says before teasingly dipping her tongue in her belly button, “you’ll have to make do with me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     When she sits back up, she watches Rio pretend to give it some thought. “Depends,” Rio says, elongating the word while one of her hands travels via her own body to Agatha’s thighs. “Do you get just as w—
     <em>
      oh shit.”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The moment Agatha feels Rio’s cool fingers trace her folds, Agatha shivers at her touch and Rio gasps at the wetness she feels.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was told women over a certain age don’t get this wet anymore,” Rio murmurs, knowing full well she’s on a mere millimeter thin layer of ice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha bites her bottom lip and decides to counter Rio’s antagonizing comment with a deadly strike. “Yeah?” she says, grinding her hips down slowly. “Well, most women over a certain age don’t get to ride the face of Rio fucking Vidal.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Get up here, my love,” Rio demands in response, thirstily opening her mouth for her first drop of water after having spent days on the floor of the desert.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha quickly goes through her mental rolodex of cheeky replies, but throws them all out the window when the realization hits that she can have Rio’s perfect tongue on her clit
     <em>
      right now.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She sits up on her knees and scoots up, careful not to put her weight on Rio’s upper body, and grins down just before lowering herself onto her mouth. “Make me come,” she orders her in a raspy voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio mumbles something in response, but it gets muffled as soon as she eagerly buries her face in her wife’s cunt, arms wrapped around her thighs.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the tip of Rio’s tongue touches her clit, Agatha exhales on a moan. “That’s a—
     <em>
      oh—
     </em>
     that’s a good girl, baby.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio briefly stops her teasing licks to look up at her with an adoring look in her eyes, making sure she has Agatha’s full attention when she says: “Thank you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha feels her lower belly burn at those words; she knows what they mean.
     <em>
      Thank you for praising me. Thank you for letting me eat you out. Thank you for you.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha closes her eyes and chuckles breathily as one of her hands slides into Rio’s hair, giving her more control over where her clit lands as she sinks down a second time. “My pleasure,” she chokes out, but then Rio stops again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nuh-uh.
     <em>
      My
     </em>
     pleasure
     <em>
      .
     </em>
     Quite literally.”
    </p>
    <p>
     As Agatha glares down at Rio’s audacity to stop for a second time, Rio bucks up her hips impatiently. “
     <em>
      Literally,”
     </em>
     she repeats herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffs to hide an endeared smile, and leans back a little bit to slide her hand past the waistband of Rio’s shorts. She feels the heat first, trapped in her underwear, fueled by a nervous system working overtime. When she pushes down further, she gasps as her fingers become soaked even before having swiped through her folds.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio!” she calls out, almost accusingly. When she brings her hand back to where Rio can see it, a thick string of sticky wetness connects three of her fingers. Between her own thighs, she can see Rio’s cheeks turning even darker than they already are.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Literally
     </em>
     can’t help it,” Rio softly defends herself, bringing her tongue back to swipe up from Agatha’s entrance to her clit, stoically keeping eye contact.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is insanity,” Agatha whispers in awe, secretly massively turned on by the fact that Rio gets
     <em>
      this
     </em>
     wet for her. She closes her eyes again and starts to grind down on Rio’s face, still holding her slick covered hand up as if it’s a holy relic.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No it isn’t,” she hears Rio protest.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why are you still talking?” Agatha whines, gyrating her hips in a futile attempt to shut her wife up so she can make her come.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The definition of insanity—” Rio’s muffled voice sounds from below, and Agatha clenches her jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Shut
     <em>
      up,”
     </em>
     she hisses, then jolts when Rio finds
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     perfect spot on the left side of her clit. “Oh! Rio, yes, right there—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “—is repeating the same thing over and over again—” Rio says between a few filthy sounds as she suckles on her wife’s clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio! If you don’t stop yapping right now—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “—and expecting a different result,” Rio explains, now slowly flicking her tongue. She makes one, two, three strokes before angling her face away from Agatha’s pussy. “Like, for example, telling me to stop talking multiple times, and still expecting me to make you come.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s self-satisfied smile is so radiant, Agatha can’t decide whether to strangle or smother the big nerd between her legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     But she recognizes it for what it is: a challenge. A dare to combine sex with creativity, an invitation to meet her in the middle of an island they’re the only two inhabitants of.
     <em>
      Don’t just take my body on a journey, take my mind too.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha only takes a second to think about the best way to take her wife’s cockiness down a peg, and leans back to slide her hand into her soaked underwear once more. It takes a lot of effort not to moan at the sheer amount of slick she scoops from Rio’s dripping cunt, making her twitch, and bringing her fully wet hand back to the front again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s jaw has gone slack already, and that’s before Agatha places the tips of her fingers against her own lower belly, slowly dragging her hand up in a straight line, leaving a glistening stripe of Rio’s wetness on the skin between her open shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lights up like a bonfire and Agatha can feel her clenching her thighs from the way she tenses up, briefly squeezing her eyes shut. “Fuck, fuck,
     <em>
      fuck.”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Excellent.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha drags her fingers up her own sternum, now leaving a wet trail between her breasts, and puts an end to their sexual war before it has a chance to start by sucking the sticky remnants off her fingers as a deep, sinful moan escapes her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     She doesn’t miss her wife's ragged breath as Rio's own hand now moves down her own body, scooping up another handful. Agatha wordlessly lifts her thigh so Rio can bring her hand to the front; an opportunity which Agatha greedily accepts by grabbing her wife’s wrist in both hands and bringing her soaked fingers to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     As soon as she provocatively starts sucking Rio’s fingers, she can hear a defeated moan from between her thighs before an eager tongue returns to her clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s whole body tingles. Rio eats her out as if she simply has no other
     <em>
      choice,
     </em>
     as if she’ll wither away if she doesn’t. Agatha grinds her hips down and revels in this connection with her wife, the way their entire being gets stimulated when they crash into each other on the exact same wavelength in the infinite universe. Had Agatha been more of a romantic, she would’ve considered it a cosmic experience between two mortals.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even though Rio’s mouth might as well be celestial when she takes her higher, higher, higher, until—
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, my love, I’m go-gonna
     <em>
      c-oh-oh— come!”
     </em>
     she cries out around Rio’s fingers, her vision turning white as she gets launched and splintered into a thousand little pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she opens her eyes again, she finds herself on her side on the mattress, with Rio’s head cradled against her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her wife slowly looks up at her with so much love and pride in her eyes, Agatha feels herself well up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t do that,” Agatha whispers, her choked up voice not matching her words at all. “Stop looking at me like that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s grin only widens. “I love you,” she says, slowly articulating every word as if carving them into Agatha’s skin. “I love you so much.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha should probably say something, should probably kiss her, should probably convey how much she loves her too, like she has done a million times before.
    </p>
    <p>
     But what is there to say or do when Rio has
     <em>
      this
     </em>
     look on her face?
    </p>
    <p>
     She can only stare at her beautiful wife, and let her have it. Let her claim this moment as the mutual understanding of the depth of their love settles in.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I always love it when you’re a bit mean about shutting me up,” Rio eventually breaks the silence with a shy smile. She scoots up so she can bury her face in Agatha’s neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know,” Agatha says in a sultry voice, kissing her temple as she feels Rio nuzzle against the skin below her ear. Agatha’s hands start lightly scratching Rio’s back up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But what if I want something different?” she continues, and fuck Rio for making her weak. Rio lifts her head to scrunch her brows in question, and Agatha takes the opportunity to position their bodies so that she has easy access to Rio’s core. “Can’t I love you in softness?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stifles a surprised sound as Agatha brings her hand between Rio’s legs; no teasing, no roughness, but attentively circling her clit exactly the way she likes.
    </p>
    <p>
     It’s as if she has found her wife’s off button when she slowly but surely feels Rio slacken in her arms, all tension leaving her body as she leans into the sensation of what Agatha is doing to her sensitive clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh,” Rio breathes, head thrown back with a blissful expression on her face. “Oh, that’s good. That’s perfect, Agatha, fuck, you’re p— perfect.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Want me inside?” Agatha whispers suggestively, but Rio shakes her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Keep doing—
     <em>
      exactly—
     </em>
     what you’re doing,” she pants, body jolting every now and then. “Perfect, perfect,
     <em>
      perfect—”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha admires her totally relaxed wife as she keeps a steady pace, her fingers easily sliding through the copious amount of wetness that has gathered around Rio’s clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s hushed words of encouragement give Agatha goosebumps all over her body. “You can be louder if you want,” she suggests with her lips against Rio’s ear. “Alice and Jen won’t be here until tomorrow, because Alice couldn’t take today off, so Jen said—”
    </p>
    <p>
     A firm hand claws around Agatha’s wrist and Rio’s eyes fly open. “There is no way,” she hisses through her teeth, “no way you’re bringing up—
     <em>
      aah!—
     </em>
     bringing up Alice and Jen while you have me—
     <em>
      oh fuuuuck—
     </em>
     have me on the brink of an— an explosive— f-fucking— orga—
     <em>
      fuck, Agatha!”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio convulses, screams with her mouth closed. Her muscles contract, more expletives burst through her lips, all while keeping her aggressive grip on Agatha’s wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she comes down, breathing heavily, her eyes flick up and she stares daggers at her wife.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I hate you,” Rio bristles, which is exactly when Agatha breaks down in laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m sorry,” she giggles, not really meaning it. “I’m sorry. I love you so much, Rio. Oh my god, I love you so much.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite Rio’s —admittedly weak— protests, Agatha gets on her knees to kiss a few apologies into her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s defiant growls turn into soft coos when Agatha covers every inch of her soft stomach in kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she’s done, she crawls back up, hovering over Rio’s face with a proud and satisfied smile, biting her lip as she takes her beautiful features in.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sighing happily, she declares:
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’re going to have such an amazing week.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     Their week turns out horrifyingly awful.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not even an hour after their gleeful reunion with Jen and Alice, Agatha announces she has to lie down for a few minutes. When Rio checks in on her an hour later, she catches her in the act of taking two ibuprofens, something she
     <em>
      never
     </em>
     does.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another hour later, Agatha starts running a fever. Any arguments against Rio’s statement, who had checked her temperature by placing the back of her hand to Agatha’s broiling forehead (
     <em>
      “You don’t have a thermometer, you can’t know for sure!”)
     </em>
     , turn out to be reasonably futile when she stares at her own sweaty and beet red face in the mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I told Jen and Alice you’re coming down with something,” Rio says as she crawls back into bed, next to her wife.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But you can still go out and have fun,” Agatha murmurs against a blanket, entire body rolled up in the covers despite it being 95 degrees.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I could,” Rio admits with a sigh, taking her clothes off against the heat, “but the last time you were sick was over four years ago, and you nearly exiled me for wishing you well. So, like the good spouse I am, I’m finally taking my moment to snuggle you back to health.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wiggles her butt in protest.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come here, little slug.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wraps her arms around Agatha’s swaddled body and manoeuvres her until she finally finds an exposed piece of skin— her jaw, which she presses a careful kiss to.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ow,” Agatha yelps, making Rio stiffen up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha curses herself in silence as Rio’s penny almost audibly drops.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha?” she says slowly, a warning sounding through. Agatha feels her wife tug at the blanket to expose more of her face. “Are you
     <em>
      kidding
     </em>
     me right now?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?” Agatha wants to snarl, but there’s barely any force behind it as her jaw stays locked in place. She feels Rio’s careful, scrutinizing fingers against her swollen cheek and winces softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is it that fucking tooth?!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ding ding ding,” Agatha jokes weakly. “Caught me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re hilarious,” Rio deadpans, which is coincidentally the same thing Agatha says about 30 minutes later, when she’s shoved into the passenger’s seat of a rented Subaru with an ice pack against her jaw, and Rio boops her nose as if she’s a baby getting strapped in a maxi cosi.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, despite being in excruciating pain, is clear headed enough to comment on Rio’s driving all the way to the emergency clinic.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did you know people can go into cardiac arrest from untreated dental issues?” Rio mentions casually as she steers the car into a small alley, successfully shutting Agatha up.
    </p>
    <p>
     It isn’t until the kind-hearted and softly spoken Dr. Eliana tells Rio in Spanish that the tooth has to be extracted as soon as possible—which Rio then translates to English for Agatha—that her demeanor changes completely.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, no, please,” Agatha protests softly, “I can’t— I can’t do needles.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio takes a deep breath and strokes her thumb along Agatha’s good cheek. “I’ll be here the whole time,” she promises. She turns around to exchange a few more sentences with the doctor, and adds: “You can get all the anesthetics you want. You won’t feel a thing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha has to admit, squeezing Rio’s hand to mush and slowly inhaling the nitrous oxide: she doesn’t remember much after Rio’s hand turns into a slippery fish and her face starts inflating like a balloon.
    </p>
    <p>
     She has no idea how much time has passed when the doctor eventually cuts her off from the gas, and starts conversing with the brunette woman next to her in…
     <em>
      Korean? Portuguese? Afrikaans?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      You speak many languages,
     </em>
     is what she admirably wants to tell her. But what comes out of her cotton-stuffed mouth instead is: “You know your lines very well.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scrunches her face when she realizes her words don’t match her brain, but— there
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     no face. She
     <em>
      has
     </em>
     no face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Inhaling deeply, she brings one of her hands up to glare at it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “If I have no face,” she muses out loud, “how come I can see my hand? Do I still have eyes?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She turns to the pretty brunette in the room. “
     <em>
      You
     </em>
     have eyes,” is the reasonable conclusion after staring at her for a few seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I do,” the woman nods, and laughs at a joke Agatha can’t hear. “Come on, we’re going back to the car.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, wait,” Agatha says with a sense of urgency, pushing herself off the dental chair only to find out that she
     <em>
      doesn’t have legs either.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     But the pretty woman—who had just tried to kidnap her—apparently has superpowers as her hands shoot out into Agatha’s armpits to catch her before she falls.
    </p>
    <p>
     That’s when she locks eyes with her again, realizes they are quite beautiful, and tells her: “You really do have eyes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Someone must be telling another funny joke, because the woman laughs again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe she is listening to a comedy podcast in her airpods.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You have ears?” is how Agatha manages to ask her about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I also have ears,” the woman says dutifully, her smile lingering. “Come on, Agatha, let’s get you back to the hotel.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sticks out her tongue to blow a raspberry, but since her cheeks are puffed up from the cotton, all she does is aggressively drool.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re gorgeous like this,” the pretty woman says as she leads her outside by the arm. Agatha knows, so she flicks her hair over her shoulder, but twists her ankle stepping over the threshold. It buckles and she is about to fall down, but her mysterious kidnapper manages to catch her again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha blinks at her as a lazy grin casts over her face. “Nice.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The lady takes her to the passenger side of a silver car, making her snort. “A Subaru!” Agatha calls out. “What are you, a lesbian?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am,” the woman says simply, opening the door for her and guiding Agatha into the car by holding both of her hands. Agatha feels like a queen when her legs are being lifted into the vehicle and the handsome brunette goes the extra mile by fastening her seatbelt for her. It makes her feel warm and fuzzy on the inside, and she decides to settle into the feeling, chasing the lady’s hand with her face like a cobra to a flute.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What are you doing?” the woman asks with an amused giggle.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Face. Hand,” Agatha states, because who needs more words? She hums contently when the woman’s hand briefly lands on her cheek, but since she still can’t quite feel her face, she lets herself heavily lean into it.
    </p>
    <p>
     When the woman pulls away, a string of saliva connects her palm to the corner of Agatha’s open mouth. “Oops.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She hears the woman’s laughter even after the passenger door is closed. But where is she going now? Is she leaving Agatha alone? Forever? Has she really just disappeared? What is she supposed to do now? How will she ever know where the woman went? Has she looked at her well enough to be able to describe her to other people? Will she ever forget her face? Has the woman already forgotten about Agatha?
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ready?” she hears on her left, and to her relief, that beautiful woman gets into the driver’s seat. Oh. Good.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the engine starts, Agatha realizes she doesn’t even know where the woman is taking her, and then she decides she doesn’t mind. She’s pretty; pretty enough to be trusted. If only she could tell her. But maybe there are other ways to tell her she’s beautiful?
    </p>
    <p>
     “Your face,” she starts, then clears her throat, then tries again, “I’m sure your face does not hate to be looked at by my eyes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman briefly takes her eyes off the road to look at Agatha, who wiggles her eyebrows seductively.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But,” Agatha adds in earnest, raising a finger for emphasis,
     <em>
      “not
     </em>
     in a sexual way. Don’t think I wanna do sexual things to your face. Because I do not. Want to do sexual things to your face.”
    </p>
    <p>
     There, that should be clear enough. However, the woman’s barely contained smile makes Agatha think she’s not taking her seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
     “If you
     <em>
      had
     </em>
     a sexual face, I would just
     <em>
      tell
     </em>
     you,” Agatha scoffs, eyes rolling. “But you have— a face. Got it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Got it,” the woman nods, now seemingly understanding Agatha’s point.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      A very okay face.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha remembers someone else with a very okay face. And after careful consideration, this woman seems trustworthy enough to tell her about that someone.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know a lesbian like you,” Agatha states in a low voice, vaguely swiping her hand along the visor to check for recording devices. She opens the glove box too, and feels around under her seat for good measure.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, do you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Uhuh. And, do you wanna know something?” Agatha leans in in conspiracy.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Please,” the woman answers eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She kissed me,” Agatha whispers. “Or I kissed her, I don’t really remember.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha throws her hands up in defeat. “Ugh, fine! I kissed her. You don’t have to be an asshole about it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I apologize,” the woman says, which Agatha appreciates. Good manners. She likes that. “How did you feel about that kiss?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha thinks about it for a while, feeling like she somehow has to convey that, so she pensively cups her chin with her fingers. But when she closes her eyes and actually recalls that kiss, she exhales blissfully.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, to be completely honest with you, it was kinda life-changing,” Agatha admits. The brunette’s jaw drops.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Was
     </em>
     it now?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, yeah, okay, but listen—” Agatha shuffles in her seat as she gets ready to defend herself. “I am one hundred percent straight, though she might be my only exception.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Your only exception?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes— I’ve never been interested in someone else
     <em>
      like that.
     </em>
     Just her.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman seems to think something over before asking: “So if I asked you out, you’d say no?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looks at her in shock. Well, fuck. This woman is really, really beautiful. Caring too. A decent driver…
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’d love to say yes,” Agatha’s voice is back to a whisper. “But I’m already in love with
     <em>
      Rio.”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman’s face contorts into an emotion Agatha can’t quite place. She watches her swallow a few times.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What— what do you love about her?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leans back against the headrest before reciting: “She’s a great listener. She makes me feel safe, comfortable. She’s funny— but I wouldn’t admit that at gunpoint. I got to know her a bit more over the last few months, and I realized I
     <em>
      missed
     </em>
     her when she went away for a couple of months. She sent me the sweetest emails though. Emails! Can you imagine? She’s so attentive. Seems to always know what I need. Pushes me just enough, but never crosses my boundaries. I was mad at her for a while, but… I think I just couldn’t handle my own feelings. It was never her. She’s literally perfect.”
    </p>
    <p>
     With her ramble coming to an end, Agatha realizes the pretty woman next to her has totally checked out— and there’s some kind of sadness in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s okay,” Agatha says empathically, placing a soothing hand on the brunette’s arm. “I’m sure there’s someone out there for you, too.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     The woman processes her advice in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Does she know?” she eventually asks, staring intently at the road. “Does
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     know you love her?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Pfffft,” Agatha vaguely waves her hand around. “I’d rather stick forks in both of my eyes than to tell her.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why? Because she might love you back?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t know,” Agatha sinks down in her seat a little. “But I wouldn’t survive it if she doesn’t.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wakes up with a stinging ache in her jaw and soft fingers scratching her scalp.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Motherfu—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hand flies to her cheek and she winces. “Ow! My god!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hello my love,” her wife’s soothing voice sounds close by. “Welcome back.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Whahappened?” Agatha murmurs sleepily.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Everything went well,” Rio tells her, carefully wiggling herself free from under her groggy wife to reach out to the night stand. “But you’re gonna feel this for a while. Here, time for your first round of pain killers— oh, and no solids for the first few days.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lets out a long, guttural groan. “We’re on fucking
     <em>
      holiday!”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “If only you could’ve seen this coming and could’ve gotten that tooth checked out three weeks ago,” Rio tuts, but softens her words with a kiss to Agatha’s temple.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s not like I can see into the future.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can’t?” Rio sounds surprised. “But Agatha,
     <em>
      you have eyes
     </em>
     !”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Huh?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Never mind,” her wife giggles at her own inside joke. Agatha is too sore to pry.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can you promise me to not tell Alice and Jen yet?” she asks Rio instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why? They’re gonna know something's up.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just tell them I have the flu or something. This is embarrassing enough as it is.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Embarrassing?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolls onto her side to face Rio fully, and sighs. “Yeah.
     <em>
      You
     </em>
     , taking care of
     <em>
      me.
     </em>
     That’s not how this is supposed to go.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looks down on her with an endeared smile. “It’s all good, babe. You know I don’t mind.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “But I do,” Agatha says. “Please?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Anything for you. You know I love you, right?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Of course I do. Did you have any doubts about that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's brightest smile yet appears as she shakes her head. “Not at all, my love. Not at all.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     It proves more difficult than they had initially expected, to keep Agatha’s unplanned dental procedure a secret.
    </p>
    <p>
     She gets away with staying in bed with ‘the flu’ for a couple days, too out of it to undertake anything anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     But when she finally makes a public appearance on the third day, she’s still tired, hurting, and—
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh come on, Mrs. Grumpy Grumperson,” Jen keeps nagging her. “I understand, you hurled your guts out, but now you have a few days left to enjoy the Mexican sun.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Shut up or I’ll barf all over you,” Agatha promises, fully clothed on a sun bed with a large pair of sunglasses covering her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen rolls her eyes at Rio, who just shrugs in an ‘
     <em>
      I am not responsible for my wife’s mood’
     </em>
     -way.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha can tell Rio wants nothing more than to gently rock her to sleep in her arms, telling her how much she loves her until the discomfort from the procedure magically drains from her body, but she also has the presence of mind not to do that around Alice or Jen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, Rio bottles it all up, only to take the cap off at night, loving Agatha in silence in the privacy of their hotel room. Whispered praises, soft kisses, the gentle stroke of her fingers ghosting over Agatha’s skin— which she in turn will always pretend to find too much at first, before giving in and loving Rio back in an equally all-consuming way.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Every day without fail, Rio makes fun of everything Agatha had said while recovering from the anesthetics. Agatha had told her off the first two times, but quickly decided to let Rio have it. She knows how much she'd probably loved to hear the whole truth.
    </p>
    <p>
     She watches Rio prepare herself in the mirror every morning, transforming her blessed grin from having had Agatha all soft and pliable from the painkillers, into something more sober and serious.
    </p>
    <p>
     And while Agatha slowly but steadily recovers day by day, Jen can’t seem to give them a break.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re being old and boring,” Jen says after Agatha declines another cocktail, knowing full well she’d regret drinking it in combination with her medication. “You need to get laid.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Which is a pretty bold thing for Jen to say, seeing as both Agatha and Rio are still regularly on the receiving end of a dramatic monologue about how the both of them had kept Alice and Jen up during their wedding week.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Maybe it’s time to tell Alice and Jen now,” Rio softly suggests on the last day before they leave. Agatha stretches her jaw, humming at the noticeable lack of discomfort, and sighs.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I guess so,” she muses, turning onto her side to curl up against Rio, placing a hand on her wife’s stomach as she nuzzles her shoulder. “Though Jen has been a bitch all week. She doesn’t deserve to know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckles dangerously, making Agatha’s ears perk up. “Uh-oh. That’s the
     <em>
      I have a plan
     </em>
     -sound.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I do,” Rio admits, placing her own hand on top of Agatha’s. “How do you feel about making her regret the way she’s been making our sex life her business?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha grins at the amused glint in Rio’s eyes. “Tell me more.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     After their disastrous last night dinner, Agatha and Rio meet back at their hotel room.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You think they bought it?” Agatha asks, carefully pushing Rio up against the wall to nibble at her jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think Alice saw through it,” Rio murmurs, “but Jen definitely thinks we’re about to divorce or something.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckles as she slowly, languidly kisses her wife on the lips. “Isn’t she about to be in for a surprise or two.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And as they slowly unwind from their last day in Mexico by sharing a couple of non-alcoholic ciders on their balcony, recalling their best memories, and agreeing to come back for a do-over soon, Rio softly elbows Agatha in the ribs when she sees the light in the neighboring room get switched off. “Showtime.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Giggling like two schoolgirls, both women get on the bed, ready to give their friends another unforgettable night. Unsure where to begin, Rio holds up her palm and gives the wall an experimental slap.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha bites her bottom lip, nods, and raises her eyebrows as if to say ‘
     <em>
      go on'.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio clears her throat, looking like she’s about to hold a speech, and with her hand against her chest she shouts: “
     <em>
      OH MY GOD!”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s grin widens. She leans in to grab the lapels of Rio’s shirt and give her a soft peck on the lips. “I love your crazy brain,” she whispers, before turning her head toward the wall and shouting: “
     <em>
      FUCK!”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     They both stop to listen whether there’s any response from their friends’ room, but it seems to be quiet still.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio slams her palm against the wall once more after which she yells: “
     <em>
      FUCK! YES!”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Now encouraged by adrenaline, Agatha jumps in: “
     <em>
      OH, FUCK! RIO! YES, BABY, YES!”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio snorts softly as she licks her lips. “Keep that up, babe,” she whispers. “And you’re gonna turn me on for real.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirks like a cheshire cat as she turns her full upper body toward the wall and repeatedly slams her palms against it. And because no one is competitive like them, Rio stands up on the mattress.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Careful!” Agatha hisses, grabbing Rio by the hips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I got it,” Rio assures her, and starts jumping up and down. “
     <em>
      HARDER, AGATHA! FASTER, DEEPER!”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     One of her moans stretches out, which encourages Agatha to stand up too, completely taken over by childish bliss as they start jumping on the mattress together.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “MY CLIT, MY CLIT! OH, YES! I’M GONNA COME, I’M GONNA COME!”
     </em>
     Agatha yells dramatically.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jesus,” Rio pants, giving her wife a hungry look. She reaches out to grab her hips, but then they hear a voice from the other side of the wall:
    </p>
    <p>
     “If you need help finding it, just text me!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Both women snicker at Jen’s pissed off warning.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think we’re close,” Rio muses, to which Agatha responds: “Oh, you
     <em>
      know
     </em>
     we are.
     <em>
      I’M GONNA COOOOME!”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hurry the fuck uuuuuup,” sounds their friend’s annoyed voice. “Some people are trying to sleeeeeep.”
    </p>
    <p>
     This causes Agatha and Rio to loudly moan their fake climax together— a cacophony of the filthiest sounds they have ever, ever made.
    </p>
    <p>
     But then, the other side of the wall goes quiet again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh no, no way,” says Agatha, now determined to drive their point home. “We’re going again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She starts thumping against the wall, even more dedicated this time. “
     <em>
      OH, YES! GOD! PLEASE, DON’T STOP!”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shakes her head at her wife and mouths ‘
     <em>
      you’re crazy’.
     </em>
     Agatha shoots her a wink and can see that makes one of her knees buckle.
    </p>
    <p>
     She listens for any movement, but their friends’ room stays quiet— until she realizes there’s a loud banging on their hotel room door.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Bingo,” Rio says.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s oooopeeeen,” Agatha sing-songs, daring their friends to walk in.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you kidding me?!” she hears Jen angrily calling out. “I’m not interested in seeing either of you naked! I need you to fucking tone it down!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looks at Agatha, one corner of her mouth tugging up. “Seems to me like it’s not that urgent,” she says in a low voice, before letting out an absolutely ungodly moan.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh for fuck’s sake! Fine!” they hear Jen yell, before the handle starts to wriggle and the door aggressively slams open.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Surprise,” Agatha sheepishly calls out, coming down from the bed, slightly out of breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What the hell?” Jen sounds half confused and half offended, while Alice is leaning against the doorway behind her, stifling a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You wanted us to get laid, Jen. I don’t see what the problem is.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah,” Rio joins in, still standing on the mattress, arms crossed. “When it comes to our sex life, I only have one thing to say.
     <em>
      Don’t worry, baby
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen throws her arms up in defeat. “That’s why you put up this whole act?
     <em>
      The whole week?
     </em>
     How incredibly—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re not listening, Jen,” Agatha says, looking up at Rio with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen shrugs. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
    </p>
    <p>
     One glance at Alice, who quietly watches the entire scene go down with a knowing smile on her face, confirms that she is the more perceptive one of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Don’t worry, baby
     </em>
     ,” Rio repeats, swinging one arm around Agatha’s shoulder to help herself get down from the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You two, I swear to god,” Jen shakes her head. She turns around and motions for Alice to go back to their room, but Alice holds her hand up to stop her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Listen again,” Alice says to Jen, who looks like she might be losing her mind. Jen turns back to Agatha and Rio with an incredulous expression on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     This time, it’s Agatha who says the words.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t worry—” she says, carefully placing her hand on Rio’s stomach, fingers splayed. “—
     <em>
      baby
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, Jen seems to be catching on.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?!” she screeches, so high the windows nearly rattle. Alice finally pushes herself away from the doorframe and brushes straight past Jen, enveloping Rio in a tight hug.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jesus christ,” she sobs into Rio’s neck. “I hate you. I hate you. Fuck. Congratulations.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckles as she softly rubs her friend’s back. “You knew, didn’t you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Of course I knew,” is Alice’s heartwarming answer. While still hugging Rio, she reaches out to take Agatha’s hand. “How long?” she asks.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I just entered my second trimester this week,” Rio murmurs into Alice’s hair, locking eyes with Jen, who is still short circuiting in the middle of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come,” Rio invites her, outstretching her hand to Jen, causing an awkward fourway hug between all of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can’t believe you both,” Jen says after having stepped in reluctantly. “If you won’t give them Jennifer for a middle name, I’m not forgiving you for this stupid stunt. Ever.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The other three women laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think you’ll be okay,” Agatha says. “A little spawn from this one?” She motions at Rio. “The moment they’re gonna look auntie Jen in the eyes, you’re gonna be sold.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen swallows audibly. “Aunt— Aunt Jen?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Of course,” Rio snickers. “Auntie Jen and Auntie Al.”
    </p>
    <p>
     That’s when Alice wiggles herself free from the hug. “Whoa! You can only have this baby on one condition,” she says. “I’m gonna be the fun aunt.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sees Jen is about to protest, but quickly steps in. “How about you two bicker about that back in your own room? We’ll promise we’ll be quiet from now on, and we have a long flight ahead tomorrow.”
    </p>
    <p>
     It takes a little bit of effort to work their friends out of the room, which— fair enough, as they have a lot of questions about the pregnancy.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But when Rio finally closes the door behind them, she lets out an exhausted sigh.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I’m so glad it’s out,” she huffs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha laughs as she sits down on the bed. “Is what you’ll say in about six months.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh stop, I’m not there yet mentally,” says her wife, who makes her way back to the bed as well. “This all worked out great. The fact that you couldn’t drink either was a perfect blessing.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Was it?” Agatha deadpans. “I beg to differ.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh come on. I can be fun to be around even if you don’t drink.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha pretends to think about that, when Rio leans in and slides a hand over her thigh.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “If not, I know of a few ways to make it more fun.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Your pregnancy horniness is literally un-be-fucking-lievable, Rio,” Agatha laughs. “I don’t think you were this bad even in the beginning.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You just moaned in my ear for ten minutes!” Rio whines, dropping back on the mattress. “I can’t help it that you’re such a good actress.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Well, I am,” Agatha says haughtily, a challenging tone in her voice. “I don’t know if I can keep providing for you in that regard.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Ha!” Rio exclaims, tugging on her wife’s shoulders to make her lay flat on her back too. “Sure. When you were still high from your procedure, you were lusting over me so bad I thought you were about to teach
     <em>
      me
     </em>
     a thing or two.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hmm.” Agatha turns to face her, softly stroking her cheek with the back of her hand. “Wouldn’t that be something? If it all had been the other way around?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio catches on and returns Agatha’s playful grin. “What are you saying?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Imagine what it would be like. You— the inexperienced one. And I— giving you your first sapphic experience.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio lets out a puff of air as if she’s received a punch to the stomach. “Oof. Okay. Tell me more.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha crawls on top of Rio, straddling her thighs, smiling at her wife having taken the bait.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “I will. I will tell you more. Why don’t you relax, babe?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio's face breaks into a blissful expression. “We have to be quiet for real though,” she says half-heartedly. “Jen and Alice will go clinically insane.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “How about you stop thinking about Jen and Alice,” Agatha suggests casually, sliding a hand over Rio’s mouth, “and start focusing on
     <em>
      me
     </em>
     .”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio nods in obedience as Agatha replaces her hand with her lips, but not quite— just hovering over her wife’s face.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So, pretty lady,” she says in a sultry voice. “You ever been kissed by another woman?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     They’re no strangers to a little bit of roleplay, and Agatha knows better than to not give her an out. But she’s rarely seen Rio as hungry or as eager as she looks now.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I haven’t,” Rio says breathlessly against Agatha’s lips. “But if
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     have, I have no judgement whatsoever. I won’t think any less of you.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha doesn’t realize Rio is making fun of her until she feels her shake with laughter beneath her. And then the words ring a bell.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “You keep holding that fucking text against me and you’re gonna have to get yourself off for the next six months,” she threatens her sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Got it,” Rio quickly says, miming locking her mouth up with a key.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha plucks the non-existing key from her fingers with her teeth, and pretends to chew and swallow.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What would you do if I kissed you right now?” Rio whispers, mirroring the sentence Agatha challenged her with before their very first kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’d make sure you’re never going to want anyone else ever again,” Agatha murmurs before finally connecting their lips, exchanging electricity at a high voltage, making sure Rio feels how incredibly wanted she is.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What else are you gonna to do me?” Rio whispers between kisses. Agatha softly hums before taking in her face with an adoring expression on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m not sure you’re ready for that, sweetheart.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s breathing turns a little heavier, her lids a bit droopier.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Or do you want me to check?” Agatha suggests innocently, dragging one of her hands down Rio’s clothed body, lovingly circling her lower belly a few times, before finally landing on the crotch of her shorts.
    </p>
    <p>
     “H-how?” Rio stutters. “How would you check?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’d slide my hand in your underwear,” Agatha explains carefully, but not shying away from providing Rio with what she wants to hear. “And then I’d drag one, maybe two of my fingers down your pussy to feel if the idea of being touched by me has gotten you wet.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nods slowly. “I bet it hasn’t,” she challenges her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s okay, honey,” Agatha responds, pressing down firmly before bringing her hand back up to cup Rio’s cheek. “In that case I’d be so glad to just kiss you until you’re soaking. Maybe feel you up a little.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She watches Rio’s eyes go hazy.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can I?” Rio wants to know. “Can I— feel
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     up?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ah, you wanna touch my tits, naughty boy?” Agatha takes one of Rio’s hands and promptly places it on top of one of her clothed boobs. “I knew it. You’ve been hungrily staring at them for ages.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio squeezes softly, making both women moan.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Tit for tat?” Agatha raises a questioning eyebrow as she grinds her hips down once— just because she can’t help it. Rio rolls her eyes at her but nods, so Agatha starts slowly unbuttoning her wife’s shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once the shirt is discarded and Rio’s bra thrown to the side, Agatha feels her mouth starting to water. Her wife’s breasts have grown a little more voluminous, but it’s mostly her nipples which have grown in size.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jesus,” Agatha breathes, shamelessly taking in the sight.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Please,” Rio begs in response, but that’s not specific enough for Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Please what?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Please touch them,” Rio says with a sense of urgency. “They
     <em>
      hurt.
     </em>
     Please.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha places both of her hands on Rio’s ribs, slowly sliding them up over smooth skin, catching her nipples between her ring and middle fingers. She scissors her fingers close and tugs softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Ah!”
     </em>
     Rio calls out in relief. “Yes. They need you. I need you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shifts her hands so she can rub her wife’s sore nipples with her thumbs. “Oh yeah? And why is that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio, lost in the sensation, babbles: “You make me feel… crazy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha softly massages her nipples for a few more minutes, watching Rio’s face contort in pleasure, wondering if she could orgasm like this.
    </p>
    <p>
     That’s when Rio’s hips start to gyrate.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How do you feel about my hand in your underwear now?” Agatha says in a raspy voice, nodding down at Rio’s moving pelvis.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yesss,” she replies. “Do it. Feel me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     As soon as Agatha releases one of her nipples, Rio lets out a devastated groan and immediately replaces the missing hand with her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck,” Agatha exhales at the sight. “Fuck, that’s hot.”
    </p>
    <p>
     With her eyes flicking back and forth between Rio’s breasts, she snakes her hand down to the waistband of Rio’s shorts and slips right past it. And just like it has been every time for the past three months, Rio is positively dripping.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh,” Agatha gasps, raising her eyebrows. “Feels like… like you
     <em>
      do
     </em>
     want to be touched by me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s half open eyes fly wide open to communicate her urgency.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think I do,” she admits pressingly. “But I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just lay back and let me take care of it,” Agatha softly speaks both of their favorite words.
    </p>
    <p>
     But as her fingers lazily circle Rio’s clit, Rio suddenly grabs Agatha by her collar and pulls her in close.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You should know that— I’m pregnant. And I need— I need to be fucked, right now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh are you?” Agatha pretends to be surprised, while hiding the hot flash that roars through her body at the reminder of
     <em>
      their
     </em>
     baby in her wife’s belly. “That sounds pretty urgent, then. How would you like to be fucked?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do you have to offer? What can you do?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Anything you want, babe.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can you just fill me up? Make me feel full?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha interrupts her own pained groan by shuffling off of Rio’s thighs to be able to swiftly help her out of her shorts and underwear.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, now fully naked, whispers: “You. Clothes off too,” because forming full sentences is too much right now. Agatha happily but quickly obliges as Rio scoots up, making herself comfortable in the middle of the large bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     As soon as Agatha joins her—but not before pressing a kiss to her belly—their nude bodies slot together like two puzzle pieces. She brings one arm under Rio’s neck so her wife rolls into her a little, the other hand trails teasingly down her body.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Now, where did you need me exactly?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio bucks up her hips.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Here?” Agatha asks sweetly as she circles her belly button. “Or— here?” Her fingers scratch over the patch of hair between Rio’s thighs.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Or maybe…”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Her hand dips down and, because she’d already gathered how wet Rio was, enters her with two fingers.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “...here?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio turns delirious as Agatha sets a steady pace, curling her fingers deep inside to stroke Rio’s most sensitive spot.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Feels good,” Rio manages in a croaky voice, licking her lips between desperate little moans. “More.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Look at you,” Agatha teases her. “You do know what you want.”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And she gives her exactly that, adding another finger, keeping two of them straight as she pumps into her, while her index finger curls into her soft front wall.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Does it feel full like that, baby?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     She
     <em>
      knows
     </em>
     it does. Rio taught her that trick.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     And while Agatha still isn’t a fan of receiving penetration herself, she’s secretly glad her wife is such a slut for it. She
     <em>
      loves
     </em>
     fucking her speechless.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     For a few minutes, she revels in the faces and noises Rio makes in her embrace as she keeps her pace, making sure to be extra thorough. Rio babbles away about how good she feels, how amazing Agatha is, how full she feels. But then Agatha sees the slightest change in her expression; like she wants to say something, but doesn’t know how.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha tries a few things; speeding up, slowing down, going deeper. Slowly but surely clocking her wife’s body language, she whispers: “Want to turn around? Get on your hands and knees for me?”
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Rio’s breath hitches and her face twists, as if considering the offer.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Yeah,” she then agrees, wincing as Agatha pulls her fingers free. As quick as her boneless body lets her, Rio flips over, getting on her hands and knees. When Agatha rubs circles over her lower back, she sinks down to her elbows, arching her back for her ass to stay up.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “So beautiful for me,” Agatha praises her, tracing the curve of her spine with a finger. Her hand trails down, to where gravity makes the light swell of her belly now even more prominent. She hums as she tickles the skin there, and Rio huffs impatiently.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     Agatha rewards her by getting on her knees behind her, slowly sliding three of her fingers back in, and kissing Rio’s shoulder blades as she finds a new pace at this new angle.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     “Oh,
     <em>
      fuck,”
     </em>
     Rio’s groan is guttural and completely unguarded. Agatha can reach deeper now, and it seems to be exactly what Rio needs.
     <br/>
     It doesn’t take long for Rio’s moans to become louder, and for her to bite into a pillow underneath her.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sight completely captivates Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think I—
     <em>
      hnnng— oh yes, yes—
     </em>
     I think I’m gonna come like this,” Rio muffles into her pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah?” Agatha breathes in admiration. “Don’t need more?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She’s happy to stimulate Rio’s clit, but she knows her g-spot orgasms can be way more intense.
    </p>
    <p>
     “N—no,” Rio manages. “Just like this—
     <em>
      ah—
     </em>
     just like this—”
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha is nothing if not determined. She couldn’t be kidnapped away from her beautiful, pregnant wife if she hasn’t made her orgasm like this.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even if her fingers start to cramp. Even if her elbow starts to ache, her shoulder, her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
     She will crawl to the end of the earth and back for this woman: love of her soul, because life is not enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh babe,” sounds the strained but familiar tone of Rio’s voice. “Oh babe, I’m gonna—”
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha gives her everything.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, fuck,
     <em>
      fuck!”
     </em>
     Rio screams into the pillow. “Let go, out,
     <em>
      out!”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha immediately pulls her fingers out and worries if she’s been too rough for a second, but then she realizes what Rio is giving her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because from this angle, and with Rio’s cunt now free from her fingers, she can watch her pussy clench and pulse through her orgasm, Rio's moans matching the rhythm of her contracting muscles. It’s gorgeous, and it’s insanely hot.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio had wanted her to see it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re unreal,” Agatha chokes out as she feels her body heat rising, head nearly exploding.
    </p>
    <p>
     It takes nearly a minute for Rio’s cunt to stop clenching, after which she finally plops down and shifts onto her back, body still shivering.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their silent bliss gets interrupted by a loud
     <em>
      bang
     </em>
     against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Good ni-hight!”
     </em>
     sounds Jen’s sing-songy, passive aggressive voice. Agatha laughs loudly as she lets herself drop down next to Rio, tracing calming circles over her arm with her nails.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was afraid I was gonna tire you out with my horniness,” Rio quips. “I didn’t expect to put Jen and Alice through the same.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t focus on tiring them out, I don’t care,” Agatha simply says, before shuffling down all the way so she faces Rio’s belly, smiling like a fool.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But tiring me out? You’d have to stop the world. Good Luck, Babe.”
    </p>
