     Summary
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      Agatha and her friends have been planning their holiday getaway for months, and the trip is almost upon them. Better yet, Agatha promised them that they would finally get to meet her girlfriend on this trip. There’s only one problem: Agatha has been lying to them. She hasn’t dated anyone in over a year.
     </p>
<p>
      Enter Rio Vidal.
     </p>
<p>
      Agatha’s coworker is skeptical of this plan, but after a little convincing, she agrees to being the fake girlfriend. Now all that’s left to do is survive the vacation.

<p>
     Agatha normally wasn’t one to check her phone during the workday, but if she didn’t get a break from this case soon, she was bound to go crazy. She haphazardly put all the papers back into the file and pushed it to the edge of her desk. That could be a later problem.
    </p>
<p>
     She glanced through the glass walls of her office to make sure no one was watching her before getting her phone out of the desk drawer. She leaned back in her chair, spinning slightly, as she swiped up on her lock screen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Stupid thing,” she mumbled when it didn’t recognize her face. Agatha begrudgingly put in her password. “What is the point of these recognition things if they never work?”
    </p>
<p>
     Now on her home screen, Agatha saw the messages app had a little bubble in the corner. She had eight new messages and could already guess exactly who they were from.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Jen: i NEED this day to go faster
    </p>
<p>
     Jen: i don’t know how many more idiot customers i can handle
    </p>
<p>
     Jen: i’m sorry but if they think one cream will magically give them perfect skin then i can’t help them
    </p>
<p>
     Alice: at least you don’t have to deal with shoplifters
    </p>
<p>
     Alice: they think they can get away with this shit just bc it’s xmas
    </p>
<p>
     Alice: we all deserve this trip i can’t wait
    </p>
<p>
     Jen: i’m just excited to meet agatha’s mystery gf
    </p>
<p>
     Jen: she’s been hyped up for so long but we haven’t even got a picture yet
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha put her phone down and stared at the messages. Generally, she would say that she was a rather smart person. This just wasn’t the best example.
    </p>
<p>
     About a month or two ago, she told Jen, Alice, and Lilia that she was dating someone. This, of course, was a complete lie, but they all believed her so Agatha just went along with it. Unfortunately, one thing led to another and now they were expecting to meet her nonexistent girlfriend tomorrow morning.
    </p>
<p>
     There were plenty of times in the past two months to come clean, and Agatha was starting to regret not doing so. At this point, it was too late. She was too far in and didn’t know how to tell her friends they’d been lied to.
    </p>
<p>
     No, they didn’t need to know that. Agatha could just tell them that her girlfriend couldn’t make it. What was one more lie? Maybe her girlfriend just had a weird work schedule.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha glanced back down at her phone and saw there were more messages.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Alice: istg if agatha is lying about her gf
    </p>
<p>
     Jen: we’re all going to murder her?
    </p>
<p>
     Jen: personally?
    </p>
<p>
     Alice: i knew there was a reason we became friends
    </p>
<p>
     Alice: but seriously
    </p>
<p>
     Alice: agatha i know ur reading these texts, bring your gf tmr or else
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha: or else what
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     There was a pause. Alice began typing, but the blinking dots in the text message bubble disappeared as soon as they appeared. Agatha smirked. They couldn’t force her to do this.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Lilia: Or else I won’t bring any booze
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s fingers hovered above the screen. Lilia was the one in charge of all their alcohol this trip. If she didn’t bring any, Agatha would have to go the whole week, the whole vacation, without so much as a buzz. She pursed her lips. Apparently they could force her to do this.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha: fine
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She set down her phone, letting it skid across her desk. Not bringing her fake girlfriend was no longer an option. This was becoming a problem. But if there was one thing Agatha was good at, it was solving problems. She pulled out her detective’s notepad and flipped to a blank page. All her best ideas happened when she was able to write them down. She clicked the pen an obscene amount of times before setting the tip on the paper.
    </p>
<p>
     “I could hire someone and they could pretend to date me,” she said, thinking out loud. She wrote down ‘Hire someone’ on the paper and twirled the pen between her fingers. “What else? What else?”
    </p>
<p>
     A few seconds later, Agatha wrote down ‘Kidnap someone’ before promptly crossing it out. It had potential to work, but it would be a bad look for her if her boss, the chief of police, walked in on her. She had to keep thinking.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not bring anyone,” Agatha said, writing down each word as she said it.
    </p>
<p>
     Even though she wrote it down, she already knew that idea would be her very last resort.
    </p>
<p>
     “What if…” she said slowly, the idea forming in her head, “what if I convince somebody to pretend to be my girlfriend for the week?” She wrote down ‘Find fake date’ as she continued developing the idea out loud. “It would be cheaper than hiring someone and way more legal than kidnapping. Okay, I’m starting to like this plan. I just don’t know who.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha paused. That would be the biggest obstacle to her potentially perfect plan. Who would be crazy enough to agree to pretend to be her girlfriend for a week? Agatha tried to think of other friends she had, but she soon realized that all of her friends were already going on this trip with her. She didn’t have many other people to choose from.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Knock! Knock!
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha looked up and saw Rio, her coworker, standing at the door. She beckoned her in. “What brings you here, Vidal?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
<p>
     She flipped over her notebook so Rio couldn’t see what she had been writing before leaning back in her chair, her legs spread.
    </p>
<p>
     “Making my final rounds before heading home for the holidays.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And I made the cut?” Agatha said in a sugary sweet voice. She smiled ear to ear, pretending to bounce up and down with excitement.
    </p>
<p>
     “You did,” Rio deadpanned. “Not sure why, though.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha dropped her corny act and returned to her typical sarcastic attitude. “Maybe you’re secretly in love with me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tilted her head in a way that said ‘As if’. She invited herself to lounge on the couch across from Agatha’s desk, leaning casually against the armrest.
    </p>
<p>
     An idea forming in her head, Agatha made an attempt to keep the conversation going.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, any plans this week?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shook her head. “Nope. Although I do plan on spending a lot of time in bed with a glass of wine.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha knew what she was about to say next was crazy, but where else was she going to get an opportunity like this? She had no other friends to ask and the ones she did have would never believe that she was dating any of her other coworkers. Rio was, unfortunately, her best, most believable option. Agatha swallowed and took a breath.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can I ask you a favor?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded and made a double finger gun. “Shoot.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, so, before you say no, let me just explain the situation. I know that it might sound weird at first, but I swear that it’s not. At least, it’s not that weird. It might be a little bit, but you can get past it pretty easy.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ve never been in sales, have you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Huh?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nothing. Keep going.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave her a quizzical look before she continued. “My friends and I rented this Airbnb cabin up north for the week. It’s in this cute little Christmas themed town and such. It’s gonna be real fun.” She paused. “Only problem is that they’re all expecting me to bring a girlfriend.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio snorted. “Sorry, but have your friends ever met you? Agatha Harkness, married to her work, has no time for girlfriends.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave her an unamused look. She slouched down deeper in her chair and crossed her arms. “Very funny. Point is, I need someone to pretend to be my girlfriend for the next week.” She raised her eyebrows at Rio. “So, what do you say?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at Agatha like she grew an extra head. “What do I say?” she laughed. “Harkness, what am I supposed to say?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, I told you it would sound weird,” Agatha mumbled childishly. “I don’t know why you’re surprised.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned back, shaking her head in disbelief. It seemed like she was having fun with this, if anything. Or maybe she was just taken back by the absurdity of the request. Agatha couldn’t tell. Rio didn’t say anything for a few seconds, just staring at Agatha with an incredulous smirk. Agatha hated the long stretch of silence between them as Rio kept the conversation under her control. She didn’t like having to wait for Rio to respond, but finally she did.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio cracked open a smile and leaned forward. “Okay, let’s say I do this. What’s in it for me?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sat up straighter. This she could do. Convincing someone to do something was easy, especially since she was great at sales.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’d get a free vacation,” she said, hoping to start off with an easy selling point.
    </p>
<p>
     “With a bunch of strangers.”
    </p>
<p>
     “A bunch of strangers who are very friendly,” Agatha corrected. “And you’d get free food and alcohol. The internet also says that this town is like a Hallmark movie level of Christmas-y.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Am I supposed to want that? Do I strike you as a Hallmark enthusiast?” Agatha was just about to say something else when Rio cut her off. “Honestly, I’m down for a vacation, but right now, my biggest deterrent is just you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha uncrossed her arms and put them on the chair’s armrests, spreading herself out more. “Seriously?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, seriously. You are not that pleasant to be around,” Rio remarked with a self righteous grin. “How much time will I have to be with you compared to how much time I can eat all your food?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Unsure, but I will gladly leave you alone as much as possible. You aren’t all that pleasant either.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hadn’t even agreed yet, and Agatha was already beginning to regret asking. The way things were going so far, her biggest problem was going to be not getting constantly annoyed by Rio’s antics— an incredibly difficult task.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stroked her chin, pretending to be deep in thought. “You know what? Fuck it, I’ll come. Just don’t expect me to be a good actor with all this fake girlfriend stuff. If this plan gets screwed up, you’re taking all the credit.” She stood up. “Oh, and don’t fall in love with me either.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wouldn’t dream of it.” Agatha brought back her overly sweet smile. “Now get out of my office, Vidal.”

<p>
     “Remind me again why we have to drive there together.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes for what felt like the thousandth time. They’d only been in the car for half an hour, and she was already wondering how she was going to survive a whole week of this.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re supposed to be dating,” she reminded Rio, gripping the steering wheel tighter in annoyance. “It’d be weird if we didn’t come together.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grumbled something Agatha couldn’t understand before turning her back to look out the window. Based on the flurries so far, it was gearing up to be a picture perfect white Christmas. As if to add to the ambiance, Rio turned up the volume on the radio and quietly hummed along to “All I Want For Christmas Is You.”
    </p>
<p>
     Meanwhile, Agatha kept her focus on the road. The GPS had decided to take them the scenic route down all the back roads. Normally, Agatha liked the quickest way best, a straight shot to her destination, but it was actually kind of peaceful driving this way. She got to see all the trees covered in freshly covered snow and the decorations in people’s front lawns. When Rio finally had the common sense to stop asking dumb questions, Agatha could step back and enjoy the scenery.
    </p>
<p>
     A little while later, the houses along the side of the road began to be less spread out, and they were soon driving through a small town. It had that same hometown feel as Westview, just with one hundred times more Christmas decorations. Strings of lights were wrapped around every tree and lined every building. They weren’t even on, but Agatha could tell that it was a sight to behold once it got dark.
    </p>
<p>
     She drove past a fancy looking restaurant and read the name “Amare” written in cursive on the side of the building. It was the font that made something click in Agatha’s mind. She had seen that restaurant somewhere before. It was on the Airbnb’s website as something to do near the rental. She glanced down at the GPS and saw they were only a couple minutes away.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re almost there,” she said, and Rio hummed in acknowledgement.
    </p>
<p>
     As they waited at a red light, Agatha realized they were actually close to the cabin, and they would have to find a way to pull this off pretty soon.
    </p>
<p>
     “I was just thinking—”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not again.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Vidal.” Agatha gave Rio an unamused look, trying to convey she was being serious. “I was thinking that we should set some boundaries before we get there. Just so we’re on the same page, you know.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio got the hint and sobered her expression. “What’d you have in mind?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, we can start off with what kind of PDA you’re comfortable with.” Agatha absentmindedly drummed her fingers on the steering wheel.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio thought for a moment before answering. “All the basic stuff is good. So hand holding, arm around me, maybe an occasional kiss on the cheek is all fair game.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay,” Agatha nodded, making a mental note of what she said. “Anything specific I shouldn’t do?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shook her head. “Not that I can think of, but if something comes up later, I’ll let you know.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sounds good. And you’re still good with this whole situation, right?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Good to hear.”
    </p>
<p>
     It grew quiet for a while as Agatha kept driving, but a few minutes later, Rio pointed out in front of the car. “Is that the cabin?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha followed her finger and saw a small wooden house nestled among the trees. It was just a mile or so outside the town center, but the nature around it made Agatha feel like she was in the middle of the woods. It was quite the freeing feeling.
    </p>
<p>
     In front of the house, Agatha saw Lilia, Jen, and Alice already there. They were each taking out bags from their cars, and a wave of relief washed over Agatha when she saw Lilia set down a six pack of beers.
    </p>
<p>
     As she pulled in the driveway, Lilia looked up and waved at her. Agatha moved to wave back, but Lilia had seen Rio and her attention was fully on her, making Agatha functionally invisible. Agatha resented how shocked Lilia looked at seeing her girlfriend, but at the same time, she couldn’t hold it against her since Rio wasn’t exactly her girlfriend in the first place.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia rushed over to Jen and pointed out Rio sitting in the car. The look on Jen’s face when she saw Rio was akin to her saying ‘I can’t believe you actually brought someone’. A second later, Jen called out Alice’s name, and suddenly all three of them were staring through the windshield at Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha knew they were going to be interested in whoever she brought with her, but she hadn’t expected them to be like a bunch of deer caught in headlines when they saw Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh, are they always like this?” Rio asked. She glanced nervously towards Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Pretty much.” Agatha unbuckled her seatbelt and reached behind her seat to grab a duffel bag. “Well, no time like the present.” She gave Rio a slight smile. “You ready, Vidal?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grabbed her own bag from the backseat. “Let’s do this.”
    </p>
<p>
     The sound of doors opening and closing filled the air, and the cold air quickly slipped beneath Agatha’s collar, freezing her from head to toe. She pulled her jacket tighter. Once they were fully out of the car, Jen, Alice, and Lilia snapped out of their trance and happily greeted Agatha and Rio with a series of hugs.
    </p>
<p>
     After Jen hugged Rio, she took a step back to examine her. “I can’t believe Agatha actually brought someone,” she said, shaking her head. “What’s your name?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And, Rio, you are…” Lilia trailed off.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha’s girlfriend,” Rio finished. She slipped her arm around Agatha’s waist and pulled her close. Agatha wasn’t expecting Rio to do that, but she just smiled as convincingly as she could and leaned closer to Rio, selling the act.
    </p>
<p>
     “Just checking,” Lilia winked.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen and Alice exchanged a look that Agatha couldn’t decipher, but she ignored it. They were probably still skeptical, but Agatha couldn’t try to convince them otherwise in the middle of her and Rio’s first impression. Right now, she had to focus all her energy on pretending she and Rio were dating or else their cover would be blown on the first day.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stayed in Rio’s arm for a few moments more before pulling away. The loss of warmth made her want to go back to Rio, but she shook the thought out of her head. She readjusted the bag on her shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why are we still out here?” Agatha complained. “It’s way too cold to be standing around in the driveway.”
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn’t long before the five of them made their way into the cabin. It was honestly bigger than Agatha expected from looking at the pictures online. Right through the front door, they were in the open concept kitchen and living room. There were windows galore on the walls letting in a bunch of natural light. They also let Agatha enjoy the outside scenery without freezing her ass off— always a nice touch. She also noticed a hallway off to the side and guessed it led to the bedrooms.
    </p>
<p>
     If she remembered correctly, the online listing said there were four bedrooms. Agatha  just hoped that she wouldn’t be stuck in the smallest one.
    </p>
<p>
     They all set their bags down near the couch and wandered around the room. Jen admired the decor on the walls while Agatha and Alice went poking through random cabinets and closets. Lilia went to the kitchen and started unpacking some of the food and drinks into the fridge.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice was rummaging through an end table in the living room when she stood up and announced, “By the way, I claim the attic bedroom.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen gave her a quizzical look. “Why would you want that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Attics have bats in them. I want to see one.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen’s expression turned from confused to concerned. “Well, when you’re attacked in the middle of the night, don’t try climbing into my bed. I don’t want bats anywhere near me.” Alice shrugged as Jen continued talking. “But speaking of where we’re sleeping,” she turned to Agatha and Rio, “one of the bedrooms has a double bed if you two want to take that one. Me and Lilia can take the other two since they have singles.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha cursed at herself internally. It hadn’t ever crossed her mind that she and Rio would be expected to share a bed. In retrospect, it should have been obvious, but she had only been worried how they could maintain their act in public. She never thought about still needing to when they were in private. Her mind ran through a thousand different scenarios of how she could avoid this situation, each one more over the top than the last.
    </p>
<p>
     Suddenly, Agatha realized that she hadn’t answered Jen’s question. She had just been staring at her blankly for a while. Jen was quickly getting more and more confused as Agatha continued not to respond. Luckily, while Agatha’s brain had been playing catch up, Rio stepped in.
    </p>
<p>
     “That sounds great, thanks. We’re gonna go put our stuff in there now.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio threw a bag at Agatha, and by some miracle, she caught it. Rio picked up her own bag then roughly grabbed Agatha’s arm, leading her down the hallway towards their bedroom.
    </p>
<p>
     “That was pathetic,” Rio whispered, her voice almost a hiss. She pushed open the bedroom door and closed it as soon as they were both through. “What happened back there, Harkness?” Rio tossed her bag to the far side of the bed then stood in front of Agatha with a bewildered expression.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sat down on the bed, dropping her own bag at her feet, and stared at the wall. “I- I don’t know. I panicked?” She gesticulated aimlessly and altogether tried to avoid making eye contact.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took a step closer. It felt like she was towering over Agatha. She curled her finger beneath Agatha’s chin and forced her to look up. Agatha glared at her, loathing the way she was being treated like a child, but Rio didn’t seem to care and she maintained blistering eye contact.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t do that again,” she scowled. “You want this to work? Because what happened back there, that’s going to lead us straight to disaster. I did not sign up for disaster. Do better.” She let Agatha’s chin go.
    </p>
<p>
     “Huh, and I thought I’d be the top.”
    </p>
<p>
     This time, it was Rio’s turn to glare at Agatha. “Are you seriously making sex jokes right now?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Guilty as charged,” Agatha smirked. Her defiant expression was a challenge to Rio, but she didn’t take the bait.
    </p>
<p>
     “Just unpack your shit. If we’re in here too long, you’re friends are going to think that we’re fucking.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio moved to the other side of the bed and unzipped her duffel bag. She angrily took out a few stacks of clothes, but when she did, the pile fell over and they all came unfolded. Rio cursed under her breath as she began to refold her clothes. Agatha was still stubbornly refusing to unpack her own bag, but Rio didn’t try to make her again. It was quiet for a minute or two before Rio spoke again.
    </p>
<p>
     “And even if that were the case, I’d be on top.”
    </p>
<p>
     It took Agatha a second to remember what Rio was referring to, but as soon as she did, a wide, triumphant smile crept across her face. Rio had taken the bait after all.

<div>
<p>
     When Agatha and Rio came out of their room, they found the others gathered around the kitchen table with an array of takeout menus spread out. They were in lively debate about what to order, and the moment they saw Agatha and Rio they tried to reel them in.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, would you please tell Lilia that we’re ordering Thai food,” Jen said with a pointed look in Lilia’s direction.
    </p>
<p>
     “Now why would she say that when we’re getting Mexican?” Lilia huffed. She narrowed her eyes at Jen and petulantly crossed her arms.
    </p>
<p>
     “I honestly don’t care,” Agatha announced as she flipped a chair backwards and sat down at the table, propping her head in her hand. She felt the low rumble of hunger in her gut. “Whatever will get here the fastest is my vote. I’m starving.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen turned her attention to Rio. “You like Thai food, right?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio just shrugged as she sat down next to Agatha. “I’m good with whatever.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha, sensing an opportunity to annoy Rio, added onto her answer. “Rio doesn’t like to get in the middle of things. Very impartial.” She pat Rio’s forearm with a faux sympathetic look on her face, and Rio grimaced at Agatha’s thinly veiled attempt to make her shut up before she had even started talking.
    </p>
<p>
     “The Mexican restaurant is only three miles away. Much closer,” Lilia said to Agatha, bringing their conversation back to dinner. “Jen’s Thai place might as well be in Thailand with how far away it is.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s four miles!” Jen exclaimed.
    </p>
<p>
     “More than three.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Would you two stop arguing!” Alice interjected. She roughly set her phone down on the table and looked at each of the women around her in turn. “I already ordered pizza.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smirked. “I like pizza.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen and Lilia, however, were not as on board as Rio was. They immediately joined forces against Alice, putting their joint anger in being overridden to use. Agatha and Rio exchanged a look, a mutual understanding, and silently enjoyed the unfolding argument.
    </p>
<p>
     “What? You can’t do that!” Jen protested.
    </p>
<p>
     “This was supposed to be a group decision!” Lilia added.
    </p>
<p>
     “You can’t just order a pizza. What if we didn’t want that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You just went over our heads! Unbelievable!”
    </p>
<p>
     Through their protests, Agatha sent Alice an impressed grin. “When’d you manage that?”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice shrugged, smiling meekly back at Agatha. “As soon as those two started arguing.” She pointed between Lilia and Jen and shrugged again. “It’ll be here in fifteen minutes.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Perfect.” Agatha stood and clapped her hands together. “Now, where are the plates?”
    </p>
<p>
     Twenty minutes later, the five of them gathered around the kitchen table, Agatha scarfing down the food at an alarming rate. Rio watched her with a concerned look, making a comment about her choking, but Agatha ignored her and focused on her next bite. Jen and Lilia’s complaints fell silent the second that food entered their mouths, and the table was quiet for a few minutes as everyone ate.
    </p>
<p>
     The hot pizza helped to settle Agatha’s earlier nerves about this whole fake dating thing and restored her confidence that she and Rio could pull it off. She may have fumbled a question earlier, but she was convinced she wouldn’t make that mistake again. And if she needed to, she could always just make something up.
    </p>
<p>
     Once the initial quiet of eating had worn off, the conversation picked back up and floated around a wide range of topics: work, family, recent movies, politics, the weather, exes, new relationships. As the conversation dipped towards relationships, Agatha could feel her anxiety slipping back in.
    </p>
<p>
     Just as she suspected, her friends’ eyes turned to her and Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “So how did you two meet?” Lilia asked. “Agatha hasn’t told us yet.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sensed that last comment was a dig at her secretive nature, but she brushed it off, easily coming up with another lie to sell.
    </p>
<p>
     “Funny story, actually. I was at the carnival this past summer, enjoying my churro, when I walked by the dunk tank. I didn’t recognize who was in there at first, so I got a little closer. Then I saw her: the lovely Rio Vidal, the one and only, looking pretty as could be.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha made heart eyes in Rio’s direction and could tell she wanted to murder her for that ridiculous story. But luckily for Agatha’s life, she was forced to play along. Rio nodded along, her muscles tense and irate, and plastered a convincing smile on her face to seal the deal.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yep, that’s how we met,” she said in a measured tone, enunciating her words just a little too much, her fake smile pushed to the limit. “At the dunk tank.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You know, I would have thought you guys met at work,” Jen said. An amused look tugged at her lips, much to Rio’s further annoyance. “Didn’t you say you worked together?”
    </p>
<p>
     “One would think that, wouldn’t they?” Rio’s tone was veering a little too sarcastic for Agatha’s comfort. If she didn’t reel herself in soon, she’d blow their cover. “It would make sense, but I guess that’s not what happened.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What made you want to get in the dunk tank?” Lilia asked, leaning forward to focus all her attention on Rio. “I don’t think I could ever do something like that. Too cold for me.”
    </p>
<p>
     When Rio hesitated in answering, Agatha kicked her under the table. Rio’s eyes sent daggers at Agatha, and Lilia chuckled.
    </p>
<p>
     “Go on, dear. Tell them. Don’t be shy,” Agatha encouraged, saccharine sweet.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio spoke through gritted teeth. “It was a fundraiser for work, for raising awareness of at-risk youth.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Such a good cause,” Agatha said dramatically, hand to her heart, shaking her head for effect. “And to think that your kindness led me to you. It was fate, written by the stars.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha bit back a laugh when she caught Rio’s eye. She was seething. Agatha, meanwhile, was having the time of her life.
    </p>
<p>
     Eventually, the conversation redirected to a new topic, and Agatha pretended to listen intently as Jen described her idea for a new line of products. Rio’s annoyance gradually subsided, and she soon rejoined the talking amicably.
    </p>
<p>
     After a while, the pizza disappeared, the conversation slowed, and their backs grew too sore to stay seated for much longer. Agatha was the first to look over at the couch, longing in her eyes. Rio picked up on it and raised her eyebrows. Agatha answered her question with a silent nod.
    </p>
<p>
     “How about a movie?” she said abruptly. Agatha might have interrupted Lilia’s long tangent about tarot cards, but she needed to get out of this uncomfortable chair sooner than later.
    </p>
<p>
     The group didn’t seem to mind the sudden redirection, and they all made their way over to the couch. Agatha found a place to sit at the far end of the couch, purposely sitting away from everyone so she wouldn’t be bothered by them. Unfortunately, Rio did not seem to get the message and sat directly next to Agatha. Their hips brushed against each other as Rio tossed a blanket over both of them and scooched closer.
    </p>
<p>
     Right. They had to sit together.
    </p>
<p>
     At least she only had to deal with someone sitting on one side of her, the other protected by the armrest.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia gained control of the remote after stealing it from Alice. She said that since Alice picked dinner, she would be in charge of the TV. Alice gave it up without a fight, and soon they were all settled into the large couch, the blankets creating a patchwork over their legs.
    </p>
<p>
     As Lilia scrolled through a bunch of movie options, Agatha’s mind was solely focused on the fact that Rio had draped one of her legs over her lap. Such a casual gesture of intimacy yet it sent her mind haywire. She ceased to function, and her muscles became frozen and uncooperative.
    </p>
<p>
     She tried to remind herself that this was a good thing. Rio was helping to convince the others that they were dating, and she was doing a much better job than Agatha at the moment, especially with the paralyzed look of alarm on Agatha’s face.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio must have noticed Agatha’s discomfort, and she leaned in a bit closer, scratching her nail lightly on Agatha’s elbow to subtly get her attention.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can stop,” she whispered, barely audible.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha felt Rio’s breath on her neck, just below her ear, and was touched by the deep sincerity in Rio’s offer. She forgot for a moment that they were supposed to be acting and simply stared in Rio’s face. Why did this woman have to look at Agatha in a way that brought her entire soul to the surface?
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     Again, her voice was a low whisper but slightly louder this time. Not quite urgent, just looking for an answer.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Agatha shook her head, matching Rio’s volume. “You’re good.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shifted her leg a bit but stayed in place. A few seconds passed, and Agatha relaxed enough to get used to the feeling, even leaning closer to Rio. Her head found a spot to rest on Rio’s shoulder and Agatha allowed herself to let down her guard for a moment as she got comfortable.
    </p>
<p>
     Soon, Agatha turned her attention back to the TV screen and saw that Lilia had been scrolling through Christmas movie options. While she wasn’t the biggest fan of holiday movies, it was technically December so she couldn’t protest.
    </p>
<p>
     “How about Bad Moms Christmas?” Alice offered when she saw it come up on screen.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia paused and waited for the others to give their input. Agatha shook her head.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nah, I’ve seen that one before.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia kept scrolling, and Jen was the next to suggest a movie.
    </p>
<p>
     “Happiest Season? I’ve heard good reviews about it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio raised her hand. “Seen it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We’re never picking a movie at this rate,” Lilia grumbled.
    </p>
<p>
     She kept scrolling for a few minutes, stopping every once in a while only for someone to veto the movie choice. At some point she got tired of waiting and just put on the next movie that came up. It happened to be Elf.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia turned to Alice. “I rescind my earlier annoyance with you ordering pizza. This group is impossible to make a decision with.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice clicked her tongue and made finger guns at her as they all settled in to watch the movie.
    </p>
<p>
     To Agatha’s credit, she really did try to stay awake for the duration of the movie. It was just that she had seen Elf a thousand times and didn’t even like it that much. It wasn’t her fault that it was kind of boring.
    </p>
<p>
     But an hour and a half later, Agatha felt Rio’s elbow poking into her side, and she slowly opened her tired eyes. It took her a second to remember where she was and why, and when she realized that she had fallen asleep on Rio, she nearly jumped out of her skin.
    </p>
<p>
     “Relax, Harkness,” Rio said with a chuckle. She smoothed out Agatha’s hair, running her fingers through it and sending a tingling sensation across Agatha’s scalp. Agatha tried to squirm away from Rio’s touch but found her arm asleep from laying on it too long. Pins and needles climbed up her arm and halted her efforts.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen stood watching them as she folded her blanket. Agatha couldn’t really make out her features, her back to the bright screen, but she could hear the jovial smile in her voice from a mile away. “You two are cute together. I don’t think I’ve ever seen Agatha let someone else touch her hair.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That so?” Rio asked, smirking down at Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha flexed her fingers to test if her arm had woken up yet. The prickly feeling had subsided enough for her to move, and she pushed herself off the couch, stretching as she stood.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m going to bed,” Agatha said.
    </p>
<p>
     “Alright, I’ll be there in a minute,” Rio replied with a hidden smugness that only Agatha could pick up on.
    </p>
<p>
     Why did Agatha keep forgetting that they were sharing a room? She tried to cement that fact in her mind as she made her way down the hall, intent on not letting herself forget it again.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha changed into pajamas, doing so quickly so Rio wouldn’t walk in on her, she took a mental inventory of the day’s events to see how her lie was holding up. Normally, she liked to lie on her own so other people wouldn’t become a liability, but Rio proved to be actually helpful.
    </p>
<p>
     She thought back to when she fell asleep during the movie. If Rio had fallen asleep on her shoulder, she probably would have thrown the woman off. Not exactly the smartest move. Rio had played along strategically, and it had actually paid off in the grand scheme of their con, no matter how embarrassing it was for Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     A few minutes passed before Rio arrived in their room. Agatha was sitting in the bed scrolling on her phone and watched Rio close the door. The moment she did, Rio dropped a mask Agatha hadn’t known she was wearing, revealing how pissed she was.
    </p>
<p>
     “The carnival? The fucking carnival? Are you fucking serious right now, Harkness?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It was improv!” Agatha dropped her phone on her lap and held up her hands innocently.
    </p>
<p>
     “You did a shitty job at it! Why did you even put me in a dunk tank?”
    </p>
<p>
     “For the at-risk youths.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio glared. “You are not funny.” Agatha tried to say something, but Rio interrupted. “Shut it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Jeez, sorry.” Agatha picked her phone back up and continued mindlessly scrolling.
    </p>
<p>
     “You will be.”
    </p>
<p>
     She glanced up from her phone. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
    </p>
<p>
     “We have six days left here. Plenty of time for me to return the embarrassing favor.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged and went back to her phone again. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Rio changing out of her regular clothes to pajamas. She climbed into bed beside Agatha and turned to adjust something on her nightstand. When she turned back around, she was wearing glasses with black square-ish frames. They matched her dark hair and eyes and made her look rather studious as she pulled out her ponytail, shaking her hair free. It landed gently around her shoulders and framed her face.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha let out a laugh, a genuine smile coming out. “I didn’t know you wore glasses.”
    </p>
<p>
     “There’s a lot of things you don’t know about me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, would you lighten up?” Agatha teased. She playfully pushed Rio’s shoulder. “You look cute.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hummed in response, trying to ignore her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can I try them on?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Absolutely not.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What? Why? Give me one good reason.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s not a reason,” Agatha pouted.
    </p>
<p>
     She waited a few seconds, noting Rio’s subtle body language until she let down her guard. In one swift motion, Agatha grabbed the corners of the frames and pulled them off. Before Rio could stop her, she put them on her own face, blinking a few times to adjust to the new sight.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh my god, you’re blind as a bat!” Agatha let out an incredulous laugh. “How do you live like this?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat, unamused, with her arms crossed. “Can I have those back?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Can you even see me right now? I can barely see you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Haha, very funny. Give them back?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha kept them for a little while longer, looking around the room and cackling as she couldn’t see anything clearly. When Rio’s look turned from annoyance to wanting to murder Agatha in her sleep, Agatha reluctantly took off the glasses and gave them back, still commenting how bad Rio’s eyes were.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio continued to ignore her as she put her glasses back on, making only a single remark as she did. “You smudged my lenses.”

<p>
     When Agatha awoke the next morning, Rio was not in the bed, but she could hear the faint sounds of talking drifting down the hall. There was a slight wisp of cold in the air and Agatha could see snow flurries out the window. She snuggled deeper beneath the heavy comforter, wanting to stay in bed all morning, but as she continued to lay there, the rumbling in her stomach and the smell of breakfast slowly lured her out.
    </p>
<p>
     She stood and stretched before pulling a sweater over her head, shivering at the chilled fabric on her skin. She wondered if this cabin had any heat. Stifling a yawn, Agatha made her way down the hallway and was greeted with the strong scent of coffee, bacon, and eggs, Christmas music playing from an old portable radio on the kitchen table. When she stepped foot onto the tile floors of the kitchen, Agatha wished she had put socks on.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was the first to notice her standing on the outskirts of the room and offered a soft smile when she saw her. She grabbed a mug and filled it with coffee for Agatha, steam curling from its surface. Rio crossed the room and passed the mug into Agatha’s hands, their fingers brushing together briefly. The heat spread from her palms and seemed to warm her entire body.
    </p>
<p>
     “Black. Just how you like it,” Rio said, planting a chaste kiss on Agatha’s cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha softened her expression at the kiss. “Just like your heart,” she replied, a smile pulling at the edge of her mouth.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hummed a quiet laugh and went back to the stove to help Alice with breakfast while Agatha took a seat at the table. She busied herself with drinking the coffee, her gaze occasionally drifting back to watch Rio move about the kitchen, and soon enough, the food was ready.
    </p>
<p>
     They all served themselves, piling strips of bacon and spoonfuls of scrambled eggs on their plates, before settling around the kitchen table again, and Agatha found herself sitting next to Rio. Their chairs squished together to fit everyone around the small table.
    </p>
<p>
     She had almost no room to move, but Agatha still found herself enjoying the cramped atmosphere. Something about the way it forced them closer together bordered on charming.
    </p>
<p>
     Examining a spoonful of egg, Agatha couldn’t help but admire the quality of the food. For something as simple as bacon and eggs, it tasted great. She knew from last year’s Thanksgiving that Alice was a decent cook, but this could hardly be compared to her average mac and cheese. Agatha briefly entertained the thought that Rio was the reason behind this culinary creation, but she couldn’t fathom Rio could be this good at something. Alice must have improved.
    </p>
<p>
     “Lilia and I were thinking of going into town today,” Jen said after a lull in the conversation. “There’s this whole tree lighting festival thing, and it’s supposed to be really good. You guys down for that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sounds good,” Alice said.
    </p>
<p>
     “Harkness and I will be there,” Rio added.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen was about to say something else when the radio caught Agatha’s ear. The Christmas music had stopped and some sort of announcer now spoke. Agatha shushed Jen, who gave her an affronted look. Agatha ignored it and waved her hand in Jen’s face to quiet her.
    </p>
<p>
     “There is a large storm expected tonight, up to six to eight inches. Power outages are unlikely but may still occur. The Holly Hills Tree Lighting Festival has not been cancelled, but residents are advised to drive carefully as roads may be frozen. Low temperatures and snowfall are expected to continue overnight. And now, back to your holiday tunes. Christmas, Baby Please Come Home is next on Ninety Seven-Nine Classic Hits.”
    </p>
<p>
     The music resumed, and Agatha pointed a piece of bacon at Jen.
    </p>
<p>
     “We still going?” she asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen shrugged. “Yeah, why not?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t tell us you’re afraid of a little snow, Harkness?” Rio taunted with a poke to Agatha’s ribs.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry, I just didn’t want to get stranded in some random town. In the middle of a storm. At night. When it’s below freezing.” Agatha took a bite of her bacon and looked at each person around the table in turn.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m glad you’re worried, but you can’t escape hanging out with us,” Lilia said. “T’was part of the agreement of the friend's vacation.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not even going to touch the fact that you just said t’was.”
    </p>
<p>
     “T’why not?” Lilia grinned and plucked Agatha’s bacon right out of her hand. She took an exaggerated bite, a glint of challenge in her eye.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed heavily and looked down at her empty plate, shaking her head. “Someone remind me why I came here with you idiots.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took this as an opportunity to throw her arm around Agatha’s shoulder and kiss her cheek again. “Because you wanted to spend time with your amazing friends and your wonderful girlfriend.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Amazing friends and wonderful girlfriend, huh?” Agatha grumbled as she stood up, laughing quiet enough for only Rio to hear. She collected the others’ plates and stacked them on her own. “I’m going to go wash these,” she said, figuring this was her quickest exit.
    </p>
<p>
     Unfortunately, Rio didn’t let her leave that easily.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll help you,” she offered, already getting up.
    </p>
<p>
     “Great,” Agatha replied. She bit back her sarcasm with moderate success.
    </p>
<p>
     The two of them made their way to the sink, and Agatha took over washing while Rio dried and put them away in the cabinets. The others had gone to the living room and turned on the TV. Even though they were only a room apart, the noise of the TV covered up Agatha and Rio’s conversation enough to afford them a little privacy. They washed in silence for a minute before Rio spoke in a whisper.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry if I surprised you with the kiss on your cheek.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha glanced behind her to ensure the others were focused on the TV. They were. “It’s okay. It’s all part of the act.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, but I want to make sure you’re still good with it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned to put the silverware back in the drawer, and Agatha waited until she returned, easily resuming their conversation like it was never interrupted.
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t have to check in after every little thing. I promise I’ll tell you if you cross a line, but for now, we’re all good.” Agatha paused for a moment and contemplated what she said next. She didn’t want to give Rio a big head, but she did want to reassure her that everything was fine. It would help Rio stop worrying so much. “If I’m being honest, you’re probably doing a better job than me at this whole fake dating thing. You’re very convincing.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio donned a cocky grin and stood a little straighter, beaming at the praise. “Damn straight.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha snorted. “You are not straight.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Shut up,” she smirked. “Now continue telling me how I am so much better than you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stuck her hand in the basin and flicked droplets of water in Rio’s face. Rio shrieked in laughter.
    </p>
<p>
     “You little–”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha cut her off and sent more water at Rio. It landed square on her face, but Rio was not about to stand there and take it this time. She cupped her hand and sent a wave of water directly at Agatha’s chest, completely soaking her sweater. Agatha’s mouth hung open in disbelief, and Rio grinned, triumphant.
    </p>
<p>
     “Go change into something pretty for me, will you, hun?” Rio ran her tongue along the inside of her cheek in a way that multiplied Agatha’s annoyance tenfold. “Don’t want you looking like me in that dunk tank all day.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pursed her lips and held her arms away from her sides, not wanting the fabric to cling to her more than it already was. It took all of her willpower not to drench Rio in retaliation. Agatha sent her a scowl as she retreated to the bedroom in embarrassment, avoiding the entertained looks of her friends.
    </p>
<p>
     Door closed behind her, Agatha peeled off her sweater and the T-shirt underneath and flung it to the corner that currently served as their laundry basket. She opened the dresser drawers, expecting to find some of her clothes, only to see Rio’s neatly stacked in uniform piles. Agatha didn’t know if she was more annoyed at herself for not unpacking yet or at Rio for being irritatingly organized and well put together. She shrugged as she pulled one of Rio’s shirts over her head. If Rio wanted to splash her with water then she could stand to lose a shirt.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha did a quick check of her appearance in the mirror before opening the bedroom door. As soon as she did, she was met face to face with Rio leaning against the opposite wall. Agatha jumped back.
    </p>
<p>
     “Jesus, Vidal.” Agatha clutched her chest and could feel her heart pounding from the scare. “What are you doing?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio slowly looked her up and down. “I see you stole my shirt,” she noted, unamused. “But I came back here since I finished the dishes. Had nothing else to do so I thought I might bother you. Oh, and by the way,” Rio leaned towards Agatha in a way that purposely intruded her personal space and plucked a piece of lint from her shoulder, “this wasn't revenge for the dunk tank incident.” She gave Agatha a look that set her nerves on fire. “That, my love, is yet to come.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pushed past Rio, ignoring the nascent tension in her stomach. “And why couldn’t you go talk with Alice, Jen, and Lilia? Why must you continue to torment me?”
    </p>
<p>
     Something changed in the way Rio carried herself, but Agatha didn’t know what to make of it.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know. I don’t really know any of them that well. You’re the only person here I’ve spent more than ten minutes with.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Aww, is Vidal nervous?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Shut up.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha softened her gaze and offered a small smile. “It’s okay. I don’t mind being your chaperone.” She slipped her arm around Rio’s waist and found that it fit well in the soft divot of her hip. “Spend all the time you want with me, baby.”
    </p>
<p>
     A brief look of confusion passed over Rio’s face before she realized they were back in the living room again. That explained Agatha’s sudden show of affection, and true to form, Rio easily slipped back into the act.
    </p>
<p>
     “If you insist.”
    </p>
<p>
     They found a spot to sit on the loveseat, and Rio once again draped her leg over Agatha’s lap. This time, Agatha relaxed into it easily.

<p>
     Later that day, the five of them piled into Alice’s SUV as the sun approached the horizon. It wasn’t too late in the day yet, but the December days were irritatingly short, the cold, snowy nights sneaking up on Agatha much too quickly.
    </p>
<p>
     Driving to the tree lighting, the sky was already a darkening, bleary gray that threatened to turn into a snow storm. Agatha was just glad that Alice’s car had a better functioning heating system than the cabin they’d rented. It probably also helped that all five of them were packed like sardines in the small space.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio, being the insufferably perfect and nice person that she was, volunteered to take the middle seat. Agatha did her best to quietly inch her way as close to the door as possible, but even then, she still felt her and Rio’s legs brushing against each other.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice continued driving them to the tree lighting, and after a while, she stopped at a closed road. A block away they could see crowds of people gathered under strands of Christmas lights draped over the town square. Alice offered to drop the other four off here while she found a parking spot, and a few seconds later, Agatha found herself walking towards the festivities as Alice drove away.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha glanced to Rio, thinking that they should hold hands, but she dismissed the thought when she saw Rio’s hands buried deep within her pockets. It would be easier not to bother her.
    </p>
<p>
     As they got closer, the happy shrieks of children running and playing filled the air. Light flurries of snow covered the ground in a thin layer of white, only for it to be trampled over by the crowds of people. Once they arrived at the edge of the crowd, Agatha could see rows of vendors selling food, drinks, crafts, and all sorts of holiday themed items. She wasn’t a big fan of crocheted hats, but she couldn’t say no to funnel cake, quickly making a beeline for the nearest food truck advertising it.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll be right back,” she told the others before darting into the crowd.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha placed her order and idly browsed the nearby vendor stalls while she waited. She paused at a stand selling metalwork items, and a cold gust of wind blew at her back. It cut through her coat and slipped down her collar, freezing her to the bone. She pulled up her hood as far as it would go and retreated into the fleece lining. Agatha couldn’t remember why her friends wanted to go outside in the middle of a snowstorm and was regretting letting them talk her into it.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time her funnel cake was ready, the snow seemed to have picked up. As she took a bite of the overly greasy food she loved, Agatha wondered how bad the storm was going to be by the time the tree was scheduled to be lit.
    </p>
<p>
     She walked back to where she had left her friends and noticed how they hadn’t moved much from that spot. Alice had returned from parking the car, and when they saw Agatha, they started to make their way closer to the unlit tree.
    </p>
<p>
     As they worked their way through the tangle of people, Agatha noticed Rio’s hand would ghost over her back every time they almost got separated. She slowed her pace to match Rio’s.
    </p>
<p>
     At the base of the tree, they found a sign saying the lights would be turned on at 7 pm. Jen pulled out her phone.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s only 5:30. We’ve still got some time to kill.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Let’s walk around the stalls,” Lilia suggested. “I always love seeing the stuff they sell.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Ha, you just want to buy more crystals,” Alice said.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia donned an offended look. “Crystals are a scam. I’d never buy such a thing. I only buy my witchcraft supplies from trusted locations.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So just a different farmer’s market?” Jen teased.
    </p>
<p>
     “None of you understand the craft. Let’s just go browse stuff we won’t end up buying.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen laughed but followed Lilia towards the stalls, Alice close behind them. Meanwhile, Agatha hung back a few steps. She saw most of it when she got her funnel cake, and nothing had interested her that much. She made a point to walk slow enough that they all disappeared into the crowd ahead of her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t notice that Rio had done the same until it was too late. They walked side by side, their strides in sync.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you doing?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Making sure you play nice.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised her eyebrows, and Rio smirked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t think I didn’t see that eye roll.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What eye roll?” Agatha was genuinely confused.
    </p>
<p>
     “When Lilia wanted to go to the stalls. And again when they started walking over there.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha simply huffed, her breath visible in the cold air. She really didn’t remember doing that, so it must have been an involuntary reaction. An appropriate reaction, Agatha thought to herself, though she tried not to roll her eyes again. They walked in silence for a few paces before Rio spoke again.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can I ask you a question?” Agatha didn’t respond, and Rio took her silence as a yes. “Where did you meet your friends? I mean, they’re not at all what I expected when I agreed to this trip.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And what did you expect?”
    </p>
<p>
     “A bunch of party poopers who always know how to throw the silver lining in the garbage.” She playfully bumped her shoulder against Agatha’s. “Like you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Mhm… remind me why I brought you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, come on.” Rio looped her arm in Agatha’s and stole a piece of funnel cake. “You never answered my original question. Where’d you meet them?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s expression remained impassive as she side eyed Rio for the theft. “I don’t normally give out that information on the first date.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hmm, and I thought we were dating for a month.” She paused, pretending to think. “Or was it two? We should really get our story straight.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I worked with Alice down at the station, and we would sometimes grab a beer after work. She was there for a few years before she got fired. This was before you were there. I don’t know where Jen and Lilia came from. They were Alice’s friends first before they were mine.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded along as Agatha spoke and reached to break off another piece of funnel cake. Agatha pulled the plate back.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you going to eat the entire thing?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, I was going to share some of it with you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You were going to share with me?” Agatha let out an incredulous laugh. “Oh, thank you for your generosity then.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You are very welcome,” Rio grinned, taking another piece.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t try to stop her this time and resigned herself to sharing the dessert with Rio. A few minutes later, they finished eating it, and Agatha looked back up at Rio. She saw powdered sugar coating Rio’s lips from one end to the other and had to look down to suppress a laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hold still a second.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took a step forward and swiped her thumb across Rio’s lips.
    </p>
<p>
     They both froze.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hadn’t realized how close she had gotten to Rio until the innate intimacy of being there overwhelmed her. She was acutely aware of the flush on her cheeks, and her eyes struggled to focus as their breaths, visible in the cold air, combined and swirled together. Rio caught Agatha’s eye, her expression unreadable, and Agatha jerked her hand back.
    </p>
<p>
     Her heart was pounding in her chest and her breath turned shallow, veering close to uncontrolled, as she struggled to pull away from Rio’s gaze.
    </p>
<p>
     “Y-you had powdered sugar on your, um, your…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks for getting it,” Rio cut her off.
    </p>
<p>
     Somewhere in her panic, Agatha missed the blush rising in Rio’s cheeks.
    </p>
<p>
     “No problem,” she said quickly, taking a hasty step backward and glancing behind her. She scanned her surroundings, looking for a possible exit. “I’m gonna go throw this away.” She held up the empty funnel cake plate and sidestepped around an elderly couple to get to the nearest trash can.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha deposited the paper plate and tried to breathe to slow her racing heartbeat. Her iron grip on the rim of the trash can grounded her as her wits slowly returned. She didn’t even make an attempt to process what had just happened and instead focused on how she could make a seamless reentrance to their conversation. Agatha looked back and saw Rio standing idly with her hands deep in her pockets.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on, Harkness. Pull yourself together,” Agatha muttered under her breath. “I don’t know what the fuck that was, but you were deer in the fucking headlights. Do better, Harkness.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head harshly and hardened her expression. She tightened her grip on the trash can before releasing it suddenly, throwing her hand to the side. The trash can wobbled dangerously, threatening to fall.
    </p>
<p>
     “Shit,” Agatha whispered.
    </p>
<p>
     She grabbed the edge of it at the last second, and as she straightened it out again, she couldn’t help but laugh and found herself grinning at a trash can of all things.
    </p>
<p>
     Something about that smile reset her mind, and Agatha felt better. She checked to make sure the trash can was upright one more time before gently letting go and walking away.
    </p>
<p>
     She hadn’t taken more than a couple steps before the sweet, rich smell of apple cider drew her in another direction. Her gaze followed the scent until it landed on a small stand, tucked between two large, extravagant vendors, and she decided to go over there.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a little difficult to make her way through the lines of people at the adjacent stands, but the apple cider stand itself had no line. Just a kind, elderly woman who gave Agatha a warm smile as she approached.
    </p>
<p>
     “One cup of apple cider, please.” She paused and glanced back to Rio. “Actually… make that two.”
    </p>
<p>
     The woman filled two cups, and Agatha gave her a few dollars in exchange. She could feel the cider hot through her gloves. The woman went to grab change from the cashbox, but Agatha promptly shook her head.
    </p>
<p>
     “Keep the change.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you,” she said, her voice gracious and bright. “You enjoy that cider now. Happy Christmas, dear.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Happy Christmas,” Agatha returned.
    </p>
<p>
     Making her way back to where she left Rio, Agatha smiled at the change up from the typical Merry Christmas. She didn’t know what it was, but something about Happy Christmas lifted her spirits, and she felt back to herself by the time she stood in front of Rio again.
    </p>
<p>
     “I got you one,” she said and held up the cup, “so you won’t steal mine this time.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned around and happily took the cup from Agatha’s hand. “What’s this?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Cider.”
    </p>
<p>
     She took a sip, sighing deeply as she drank. “Thank you.” Rio tightened her grip around the cup. “This is so hot it’s burning my hands, but I don’t even care right now.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave her a concerned, slightly confused look until she glanced down and saw that Rio had no gloves on. The tips of her fingers were significantly paler than they were supposed to be. Agatha’s eyes widened. “Where are your gloves?!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled sheepishly, hiding her face behind the cider. “Forget them at the cabin.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You idiot. You’re going to get fucking frostbite. It’s like twenty degrees out. Here, give me your cup. Put your hands back in your pockets.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tried to put up a fight as Agatha wrangled the cup from her hands, but her fingers were too numb and cold to hold on to it properly. She grumpily stuffed her hands in her pockets and looked at Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can I have that back anytime soon?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nope,” Agatha said, popping the P. “If you want some, I’ll hold it up so you can drink out of it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you serious?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grinned ear to ear and nodded. She held up the cup, waving it in front of Rio’s face. “Want some?” she teased.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio ran her tongue along the inside of her cheek and glared at Agatha. “I hate everything about this.” She looked down. “But yes, I do.”
    </p>
<p>
     In a feeble attempt to regain the upper hand, Rio tried to grab the cup, but Agatha moved it away as soon as her hands left her pockets.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ah, ah, ah.” Agatha kept the cup high above her head and out of Rio’s reach. “Keep your hands where I can’t see ‘em.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio reluctantly put her hands back in her pockets and looked at Agatha again, raising her eyebrows expectantly. Agatha grinned as she lifted the cup to Rio’s mouth, tilting it slowly so that Rio could position herself to drink out of it without spilling cider everywhere.
    </p>
<p>
     “I swear, if you dump this all over me…” Rio trailed off as she took her first sip. “Hmm, this is actually pretty good.” She took another drink. “Where’d you get this?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha lowered the cup and gestured in the direction of the cider stall. “Over there. And I’m offended you would think I’d dump it on you. When have I ever done anything like that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Would you like a list? I think I have one in my phone.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Show it to me later. You want more?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded, and Agatha helped her take another drink. Agatha was mildly impressed they could work together and not spill any.
    </p>
<p>
     “We should probably get back to your friends soon. We’ve been away from them for a while.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha ignored the pang she felt in her stomach and went along with Rio’s suggestion.
    </p>
<p>
     They found Alice and Jen first standing in the dense cluster of people near the unlit tree. Jen informed them that Lilia was still shopping around the stalls but that she’d be back soon. In the meantime, they chatted while waiting for the tree lighting to happen.
    </p>
<p>
     Every few minutes, Rio asked for another sip of apple cider, and she even let Agatha hold the cup while she drank. Jen and Alice didn’t tease them, but Agatha knew that they were going to later. She wasn’t normally the soft, girlfriend-y type who held a cup for someone, and this was prime mocking material. There was no world where they let her live this down.
    </p>
<p>
     A little while later, Lilia came back from the vendor stalls, pushing her way through the crowd to get to the group, several bags swinging from her arms. She stopped in front of their group and dumped the collection of bags on the ground with a huff.
    </p>
<p>
     “Who knew Christmas shopping was such a workout?” she laughed, rubbing her forearms where the heavy bags had left indentations. “Agatha, Rio, I may have gotten you an early Christmas gift.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia bent back down and dug through one of the bags until she found the item in question. She pulled out a long, multicolored knit scarf from a brown paper bag and beamed as she presented it to Agatha and Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Before Agatha knew what was happening, Lilia stepped forward and began wrapping the scarf around both her and Rio at the same time, forcing them to stand closer as the scarf encircled them.
    </p>
<p>
     “I did get one for each of you, but I thought this would be more fun for now,” Lilia grinned.
    </p>
<p>
     “Lilia,” Agatha grumbled, slightly pulling away from Rio to test how much room she had. It wasn’t much. The warmth of Rio’s shoulder already pressed against her own and made her conscious of every move she made. “Is this really necessary?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s freezing cold out! Of course it’s necessary,” she exclaimed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, I think it’s great,” Rio said. Agatha could hear the smirk in her voice. “Thank you, Lilia.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re very welcome, Rio,” Lilia said with a smile. She turned and gave Agatha a pointed look. “You could learn a thing or two from her about manners.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha ignored her and turned her attention to a short man making his way to the front of the crowd, microphone in hand. It looked like the tree lighting was about to start. She watched him fiddle with the microphone controls for a minute or so, testing it twice with no success, until he noticed a cord on the ground and plugged in the microphone. Agatha heard Rio let out a quiet laugh through her nose and knew that she was watching the same spectacle.
    </p>
<p>
     The man cleared his throat. “Uh, hello, everybody?” He looked relieved when the audio actually worked, and his confidence built from there. “I have an announcement to make: The borough has declared a winter storm warning and is forcing everyone to go home due to the harsh weather conditions. I’m very sorry, but this means that tonight’s tree lighting will have to be rescheduled to next week.”
    </p>
<p>
     A ripple of worry spread through the crowd, and, almost on cue, a freezing blast of wind covered everyone in a new layer of snow. Agatha closed her eyes against the biting cold and felt Rio take a step backwards into her. Her arms subconsciously moved to hug Rio closer, pulling their bodies together.
    </p>
<p>
     The wind did not relent, and Agatha tucked her chin into their scarf to protect it from the harsh cold. As she did, Rio took another step back, pressing herself even further into Agatha to shield against the snow, and Agatha briefly caught the smell of Rio’s rich, earthy cologne before it was blown away by the wind. Agatha realized just how close they were.
    </p>
<p>
     As few seconds later, the wind finally stopped enough for them to talk again.
    </p>
<p>
     “Does that mean we just go home now?” Alice asked. “Is it just over?”
    </p>
<p>
     Looking around, that seemed to be the general consensus. The rest of the crowd was gradually moving away from the tree and towards the parking lot.
    </p>
<p>
     “I guess so,” Jen said. “That sucks, though. I had really wanted to see the lights.”
    </p>
<p>
     The five of them let themselves get caught up in the flow of the crowd, and although the wind didn’t push them together anymore, Agatha and Rio were still tied together by Lilia’s scarf. It took them a few steps to get the hang of walking as one, but they figured it out after almost falling a couple times.
    </p>
<p>
     Once they were away from the center of the festival, Alice led them to where she parked the car. They all piled in, Alice immediately turning the heat on full blast, and in the frenzy of settling into their seats, Rio stole her cup of cider from Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey!” Agatha exclaimed. She tried to grab it back, but Rio held it out of her reach.
    </p>
<p>
     “The car’s heated. You can’t stop me,” Rio said. She took a long, exaggerated drink, never breaking eye contact with Agatha. Lowering the cup, she wiggled her bare fingers in Agatha’s face. “It wasn’t even that cold out anyway.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio checked the lid before storing the cup in the nearest cup holder. Once it was safely packed away, she readjusted the way she sat so she could lean her head on Agatha’s shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha bristled, not expecting it, but when Rio gently set her hand on Agatha’s knee,  smoothing out the fabric of her jeans, she was able to relax. Almost.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio!” Agatha saw how her pale hands were from the cold— patches with almost no blood left were scattered across her fingers. She grabbed Rio’s hand.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?!” Rio sat up straight, looking worriedly at Agatha’s sudden outburst.
    </p>
<p>
     “Your hands look like a dead person’s! How are you not freaking out?”
    </p>
<p>
     Even just holding Rio’s hand in her own, Agatha could feel how deeply cold she was. It was like pure ice was attached at the end of Rio’s arms, yet she somehow seemed unfazed.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged. “I’ve got Raynaud’s. It’s fine, though.” She settled her head back on Agatha’s shoulder and murmured, “You worry about me too much.”

<p>
     The best way Agatha could describe getting from the driveway to the front door was complete and utter pandemonium.
    </p>
<p>
     The storm had picked up considerably during their drive home, and with the short winter days, it was already pitch black out. She could barely see ten feet in front of her. A few inches of snow had accumulated on the walkways and made it difficult to move, and the wind whipped relentlessly, freezing every bone in Agatha’s body.
    </p>
<p>
     And on top of all that, Lilia enlisted the help of everyone else to bring in her Christmas gifts. She shouted over the storm, telling them which bags to grab and chastising them when they tried to peek at what she bought. She directed them around like a drill sergeant until they finally got everything inside.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen heaved the door shut and sealed them off from the cold.
    </p>
<p>
     They kicked off the snow buildup from their shoes, and Agatha moved to hit the light switch. Nothing happened. She flicked it up and down a few more times only to get the same result.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, well that’s just great.” Lilia threw her hands in the air.
    </p>
<p>
     “If the lights don’t work, does the heat at least still work?” Jen asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio walked over to the thermostat on the wall. She pushed a few buttons. “Doesn’t look like it. On the bright side, it’s sixty-six degrees in here.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not much of a bright side,” Jen said. “What are we supposed to do then?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I could try to make a fire in the living room,” Alice offered.
    </p>
<p>
     “You can’t always resort to arson, Alice,” Agatha said, clicking her tongue.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice crossed her arms, shifting her weight to one foot as she looked at Agatha. “I was talking about the fireplace. There’s logs next to it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I believe in you, Boy Scout.” Agatha gave a salute. “I’m gonna go change out of these clothes.”
    </p>
<p>
     A few minutes later, they all returned to the living room in fresh pajamas to find a roaring fire in the fireplace. It was already noticeably warmer, and the sounds of crackling wood and amber glow set quite the ambiance.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m so glad our resident butch knows how to start a fire,” Agatha said sarcastically, draping her arm over Alice’s shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio came over and pulled Agatha off her. “Would you stop teasing Alice?” She held Agatha’s face in one hand and forced her to look at her. Agatha’s cheeks squished in Rio’s grip. “You’d freeze without her.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice grinned, and when she started talking, Rio moved Agatha’s head to make sure she could see Alice. “Agatha, I’m really liking this girlfriend of yours. She knows how to keep you in line.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I sure do,” Rio said, kissing the tip of Agatha’s nose.
    </p>
<p>
     “Would you let go of me now?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio changed her voice to sound like a mother talking to a petulant child. “Do you promise to behave?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m going to strangle you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh, I’m going to go change,” Alice said, drawing Agatha’s attention away from Rio. She put her hands in her pockets and rocked back and forth on her heels. “I’ll leave you two to whatever foreplay this is.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha quickly squirmed out of Rio’s grip. “What?! No. No, this is not foreplay! Alice, get back here.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice, however, was already scurrying down the hallway, and Agatha could still hear muffled laughter after she closed the door. Her face burned with embarrassment, and she sent a glare to Rio, who responded with a cheery smile, waving her fingers.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha went to sulk near the fireplace for the next few minutes and reluctantly joined the others in the kitchen when they started talking about dinner. Since they couldn’t cook anything, Lilia pulled out cans of Spaghettios and passed them around. Agatha grabbed a handful of spoons and distributed them once everyone was seated on the couch.
    </p>
<p>
     They ate for a little while before Agatha got up to go back to the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Anyone want a beer?” she asked. “I’m grabbing one.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll take one,” Rio said.
    </p>
<p>
     “Me too,” Alice added.
    </p>
<p>
     “Lilia, did you bring any wine?” Jen asked, and Lilia nodded. “Can you get me a glass of that?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes. “This is a restaurant after all, so why not.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You asked me if I wanted a drink,” Jen replied, putting up her hands innocently.
    </p>
<p>
     “I asked if you wanted a beer.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Can you get me a glass, too?” Lilia cut in.
    </p>
<p>
     “All of you are the bane of my existence.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grumbled as she pulled out three beers from the fridge and a bottle of wine off the counter. She initially moved to quickly close the fridge, remembering there was no power, but then she figured that it was actually colder outside the fridge than inside. So instead she took her time.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey! What’s taking so long in there?” Rio called out, a hint of teasing in her voice.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha just ignored her as she searched through the cabinets to find wine glasses. She couldn’t find any and settled on two strange looking mugs instead. There was no telling where they came from, but the colors and irregular shapes suggested an alien civilization.
    </p>
<p>
     Delicately finding a way to balance all the drinks in her arms, Agatha made her way back to the living room. As soon as she was closer to the fireplace, she felt the warmth return immediately. She hadn’t realized how cold it was mere feet away from the blazing fire.
    </p>
<p>
     She handed out the drinks and shrugged in response when Jen and Lilia gave her confused looks about their wine glass substitutes.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know. This cabin is weird.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha settled back in her spot on the couch next to Rio, taking a sip of beer. Months ago, when they were planning this trip, she hadn’t expected to spend their time eating out of cans around a fire during a power outage, but it wasn’t turning out to be too bad.
    </p>
<p>
     She glanced over to Rio and watched her engage in the conversation with her friends, seemingly more comfortable with them than she was earlier. Rio easily joked and bantered with the other three, and Agatha was content to just sit back and enjoy the conversation.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha watched the way the glow of the fire illuminated Rio’s face. The reflection of flames danced across her soft features, creating stark valleys and peaks of light and shadow. When she tossed her head up in a laugh, the firelight lit up her smile in a way that sent a fluttering sensation through Agatha’s insides.
    </p>
<p>
     Unsure why she felt like that, Agatha took another sip of her beer in an attempt to hide her face, but once she lowered the bottle, she went right back to intently watching Rio’s every move.
    </p>
<p>
     The conversation continued for a while, but Agatha was too mentally tired to participate. Eventually, their cans of Spaghettios emptied, followed soon by their drinks. Jen was the first to excuse herself to go to bed, and Alice was next. By that time, Agatha had her head resting on Rio’s shoulder and had been like that for quite some time. It was apparently a comfortable pillow.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked down at her and kissed her forehead to get her attention. “Do you want to go to bed?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hmm? Sure.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia got up too. “Do you think we should put out the fire?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio glanced at it and shook her head. “It’ll burn out soon enough. There’s only half a log left.”
    </p>
<p>
     With that, the three of them made their way back to their respective bedrooms.
    </p>
<p>
     The bedroom was much colder than the living room, so Agatha and Rio wasted no time getting under the covers. But with every passing minute, Agatha longed to return to the heat of the fire. She hadn’t realized how thin their blanket was until just now.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio seemed to be having a similar problem. She tossed and turned beside Agatha, unable to get comfortable. She readjusted herself again, and her foot brushed against Agatha’s leg. It was like ice.
    </p>
<p>
     “Jesus, Vidal.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hmm? Oh, sorry.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Is there any part of your body that isn’t below freezing?”
    </p>
<p>
     It was too dark to see Rio’s face, but Agatha could easily picture the self righteous smirk on her face. Her voice had a devilish drawl to it when she spoke. “Why don’t you come find out?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pushed her palm into Rio’s face. “Shut your face hole.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stifled a laugh, but not well. “You wanna go back out to the living room?” she asked. “We could add another log and sleep on the couch.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s not a bad idea,” Agatha said, halfway between a sigh and a grumble.
    </p>
<p>
     She threw off the blankets and immediately regretted it. They may have been thin, but they were still slightly warmer than the room’s temperature. She let out a hiss at the cold air bombarding her skin, hearing Rio chuckle behind her as she got out of the bed.
    </p>
<p>
     Before Agatha could do anything else, she felt icicles slip down her collar and onto the back of her neck.
    </p>
<p>
     “Jesus fucking Christ, Vidal!” Agatha spun around and caught Rio’s wrists in her hands. “What in God’s name are you doing?!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tried to pull her hands back, but Agatha didn’t let go.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thought it’d be funny.” She grinned, raising her eyebrows. “Was right.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I- I don’t even…” Agatha didn’t bother to finish the sentence.
    </p>
<p>
     She released one of Rio’s wrists but kept the other securely in her grip, dragging Rio to the living room. Agatha tossed her towards the couch and went to add a few more logs. She didn’t have Alice’s skills with the fire and the finished product wasn’t pretty, but it worked. The room was already heating up.
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha turned back to the couch, Rio had collected all the blankets in the room and created a nest on the couch. She patted the spot next to her, smiling sweetly. Agatha clenched her jaw.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you,” she grunted, taking a seat beside Rio. She stared grumpily at the fire and crossed her arms, pouting like a toddler.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, come on, you can’t be that mad about it,” Rio said, a smile playing on her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t respond.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio softened her expression. “Okay, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have done that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha glanced at Rio and found her expression to be a curious combination of mirth and remorse. It caught her off guard, and she could feel a smile gathering on her lips. Not wanting to reveal that to Rio, she reigned in her emotions and remarked, “Shoulda poured that cider on you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey!” Rio giggled, playfully pushing Agatha’s shoulder. “You wouldn’t dare.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I would.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Shut up. Let’s just go to sleep.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Only since you’re suggesting it,” Agatha said, repositioning herself under the blankets.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s that supposed to mean?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hummed, questioning. “Oh, nothing.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, right.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha fluffed the pillow beneath her head and closed her eyes. “What? I can’t hear you. I’m asleep.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re impossible.” Rio slipped her legs beneath the blankets and made herself comfortable. After a few seconds of messing with them, she finally settled enough to lay down. “Goodnight, Harkness.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s voice was already laced with sleepiness, and Agatha smiled softly into her pillow.
    </p>
<p>
     “Night, Vidal.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha refocused her sight on the fire in front of her, listening to the quiet crackling of flames. A few minutes passed, and she could hear Rio’s breathing gradually slow until she fell asleep.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn’t know why, but Agatha propped herself up a bit on her elbow to look at Rio. Her sleeping face was illuminated by the fire like it had been earlier, but something about it was different this time. Agatha couldn’t exactly pinpoint it, but she stared at Rio until her eyes grew heavy.
    </p>
<p>
     She put her head back down on the pillow and closed her eyes, welcoming the approaching sleep, but as she drifted off, there was a tiny voice in her head reminding her that this was supposed to be fake. A hoax. None of it was real.

<p>
     Agatha stirred, picking up her head and sleepily blinking her eyes half open, but when she tried to move her arms and legs, she found that she couldn’t. She tried again, but there was still something blocking her. It felt like a heavy weight was covering her entire body. Growing frustrated, Agatha opened her eyes all the way, and she nearly jumped back at what she saw. Confusion and anxiety found their way into her expression, and it required a concerted effort to fight it down.
    </p>
<p>
     Apparently, at some point last night, she and Rio had become entangled in one another on the couch. Rio currently slept on top of Agatha, using her chest as a pillow.
    </p>
<p>
     For a few seconds, Agatha peacefully watched the rise and fall of Rio’s breathing, allowing the steady rhythm to calm her down. At the sound of a light chuckle, she glanced up.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s eyes widened, a restrained panic coursing through her. Jen sat on the other couch watching her earnestly. She fought down the nervousness of being caught, reminding herself to play this off as natural. Couples fell asleep together all the time. This was normal.
    </p>
<p>
     Hopefully, Jen hadn’t seen Agatha’s initial confusion.
    </p>
<p>
     “Morning,” Jen said, raising her coffee mug to say hello. A light smirk played at her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good morning,” Agatha grumbled. Annoyance was easier to play off than whatever else she was feeling at the moment.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t think I’ve ever seen you like this.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Like what?” she snapped back. Rio shifted, still asleep but lightly tugged from her slumber by the sharp tone, and Agatha lowered her voice to avoid waking her up. Quieter, she repeated, “Like what?”
    </p>
<p>
     “All soft and sweet and gentle like you are with Rio,” Jen smiled.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha resisted the urge to roll her eyes. “We just fell asleep. That’s not exceptionally soft, sweet, or gentle.“ Her voice had grown louder again, and Rio moved slightly. Annoyed at herself, Agatha closed her mouth, and brought her hand to rest on Rio’s back until she settled. Agatha took a deep breath, promising herself that she would keep her volume under control this time. “We were just tired from that failed tree lighting.”
    </p>
<p>
     Entering the living room, Alice sat partially upside down on the couch with her legs draped over the arm of it. She lounged back, resting her weight on her elbows and gave Agatha a pointed look. “Say what you want but you are.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Example,” Agatha demanded, her voice carefully below her regular speaking volume.
    </p>
<p>
     “Last night, you held her cup for her,” Jen paused for emphasis, “while she was drinking out of it.” She laughed, “You didn’t see any of us doing that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “None of you forgot your gloves,” Agatha quipped back.
    </p>
<p>
     “We aren’t saying it’s a bad thing.” Alice flipped to sit upright, folding her legs beneath her. “It’s just nice to see you like this.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re normally so grumpy, but with her, you seem at ease,” Jen added. “Happier.”
    </p>
<p>
     Just when Agatha was going to contradict them again, Lilia poked her head out from the kitchen, pointing a spatula at Agatha. “Accept it: you’re down bad.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I-” Agatha bit her tongue and swallowed her rebuttal.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn’t want to say more than she should. If she denied this too much, they might pick up on the fact she and Rio weren’t actually dating. But if she just let them tease her without fighting back, they’d still figure out something was up. Agatha had to play this just right and choose her words carefully. She absentmindedly played with a strand of Rio’s hair between her fingers as she drew in a deep breath.
    </p>
<p>
     “I am not ‘down bad’, as you so crudely described it, Lilia.” She glared at Lilia before softening her tone. “But maybe I am— what did you call it?— happy. Or something like that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Feeling triumphant, Alice, Jen, and Lilia grinned at each other, and Agatha relaxed again, knowing she was a world class liar. They had all fallen perfectly into her web of lies.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia lowered her spatula, sheathing the weapon, and disappeared back into the kitchen with a grin.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen gave Agatha a knowing smile. “See, was that so hard?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t push your luck.”
    </p>
<p>
     “There’s the Agatha we know and love,” Alice laughed.
    </p>
<p>
     For the next few minutes, Jen and Alice talked while Agatha periodically shushed them when they got too loud, not wanting to wake Rio, and eventually, Lilia announced that breakfast was ready.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait, I thought the power was out,” Agatha said. She glanced up at the ceiling and saw the overhead light on, making her more confused.
    </p>
<p>
     “It came back on last night,” Alice explained as she and Jen made their way towards the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, wait, I can’t get breakfast. She’s still asleep on top of me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen shrugged. “I can’t help you with that.”
    </p>
<p>
     She watched them leave and resigned herself to staring at the fire. She idly wondered why they kept it burning if the power was back, but she figured it probably worked better than the cabin’s shoddy heating system. Either that or Alice just liked keeping the fire going.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha watched the flames, bored, as the gnawing hunger in her stomach grew.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you want me to get up now?” Rio asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Gah!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nearly jumped out of her skin. Heart pounding, she looked down at Rio and found her awake and fully alert.
    </p>
<p>
     “When did you wake up?!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio ran her tongue on the inside of her cheek and looked at the ceiling, avoiding Agatha’s eyes, a smirk forming on her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     “How long ago would make you the least mad?”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “A little after Jen came in here.” Rio finally stopped looking at the ceiling and met Agatha’s eyes, nothing but mischief in her gaze. “That’s when I woke up.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ve been awake this whole time?!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio bit her lip. “Yes.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stood abruptly, and Rio tumbled off the couch, landing on the floor in a mess of blankets. Her hair was messy and tousled with several strands hanging in front of her face. Rio tried to blow them out of the way, but they hardly moved. Agatha glared down at her, armed crossed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why did you pretend to be asleep?” Agatha demanded.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t let you miss out on an opportunity to be teased by your friends. What kind of person would I be if I stopped that?” Rio brushed the hair out of her face, allowing Agatha to see the full extent of the impish expression she wore. “As long as I was ‘asleep’, you had to sit there and take it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t even want to look at you,” Agatha said, turning on her heel. She bit back a reluctant smile that Rio, or anyone else, couldn’t see.
    </p>
<p>
     She was well aware that the open concept cabin had afforded her no privacy in that conversation, and her friends had definitely seen her toss Rio off the couch.
    </p>
<p>
     Even so, she ignored their amused looks as she made herself a bowl of dry cereal. She didn’t know how long the fridge had been off last night but she’d rather stay on the safe side. Agatha grabbed a spoon before going into the cabinets to find more of those bizarre looking mugs. She grabbed two and filled them with coffee, balancing them on her arm with the bowl.
    </p>
<p>
     Leaving the other three gathered around the table, Agatha made her way back to the living room, wordlessly passing a mug to Rio, who still sat on the floor.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha settled cross legged on the couch, resting her cereal in her lap. She hunched over the bowl and took a few bites, moving the dry wheat flakes around her mouth. A few seconds passed and Agatha said,
    </p>
<p>
     “Why are you still on the floor?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio glanced up from her mug but wasted no time joining Agatha on the couch.
    </p>
<p>
     — — —
    </p>
<p>
     Standing in just a long sleeve shirt and underwear, Agatha dug through her duffel bag wishing she had unpacked her clothes earlier. She didn’t remember it being so disorganized when she originally packed them. But now, only three days into their vacation, she already couldn’t find anything she needed to get dressed.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stood on the other side of the room, already dressed in a T shirt and jeans and waiting for Agatha to finish.
    </p>
<p>
     “Would you hurry up?” Rio asked impatiently. She rested most of her weight on her right leg with her arms crossed. If she wasn’t so frustrated with trying to get dressed, Agatha might have found the annoyed stance kind of cute.
    </p>
<p>
     Grabbing a handful of clothes from the bag, Agatha threw them onto the bed. “Sorry, but I could have sworn that I packed another pair of jeans.” She hunted through the disorderly pile. “Where the hell are they?” She turned her duffel bag upside down and roughly shook out the few remaining contents.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh for Pete’s sake,” Rio said, walking over to the dresser. She rummaged through a drawer for a moment and tossed something at Agatha’s head. “Just wear this so we can all get on with our day.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stood there with a pair of Rio’s pants tangled around her face. She took her time to get them off, going slower to annoy her more. If Rio wanted to throw clothes at her, then she could stand to wait two seconds. Agatha, of course, took much longer than just two seconds, but when she finally disentangled the pants and held them in front of her legs, she frowned.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know if these will fit me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio rolled her eyes. “Just put them on already.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grumbled the whole time but complied with the instructions. Surprise found its way onto her face as she put them on.
    </p>
<p>
     “How do your pants fit me so well?” Agatha asked, dancing around a bit to settle into the jeans.
    </p>
<p>
     “They’re yours, dumb-dumb.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You-”
    </p>
<p>
     “Put away your clothes. Yes. You’re welcome.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha finished buttoning her pants and looked back up at Rio, her brow furrowed in confusion. “But why would you only do some of them?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged. “That’s all I had time for.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You are… incredibly confusing, Vidal.”
    </p>
<p>
     She gave Agatha an unamused look. “Like I said earlier, you’re welcome.” Rio reached over the bed and picked up one of Agatha’s sweatshirts from the pile of clothes. She slipped the dark green garment over her head.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey!” Agatha protested. “What’s that for?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio untucked her hair from the sweatshirt’s collar. “Since you haven’t thanked me, I’m taking this as my payment.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha bit her lip and suppressed a laugh. A piece of Rio’s hair had been messed up when she put on the sweatshirt, and it strayed away from the rest of her orderly hair.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine,” Agatha huffed. “Thank you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled, satisfied, and patted Agatha’s cheek. “You are welcome.” But then her hands found their way to the front pocket, making themselves comfortable, and Rio’s smile morphed into a sly grin. “I’m still keeping this, though.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio made her way to the bedroom door, and Agatha wanted to let her go without telling her about the messed up hair. Unfortunately, Agatha’s conscience got the better of her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hold on.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned around and looked at Agatha with mild annoyance for stopping her, but Agatha couldn’t stop herself from letting out a small chuckle.
    </p>
<p>
     “What could you possibly be laughing at?” Rio crossed her arms.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha walked across the room and stood in front of Rio. She tilted her head to examine the hair, continuing to ignore Rio’s questions. Wordlessly, she picked the offending piece of hair and straightened it out, laying it down with the rest of Rio's hair. Agatha ran her fingers through Rio’s hair a few more times to smooth everything out before taking a step back. She checked it once more before becoming satisfied with her handiwork.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha loftily pat Rio’s cheek. “There. You’re welcome.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s hand floated over her hair and found it even. She readjusted herself, putting up an undeterred front to Agatha’s closeness. “Thank you.”
    </p>
<p>
     — — —
    </p>
<p>
     By the time Rio and Agatha made their way back to the kitchen, the others were pulling out a couple of board games and setting them up on the cramped kitchen table.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was happy to spend the day inside away from the cold, and the next couple hours passed with the five of them sitting shoulder to shoulder around the table. Everyone won at least one game, but throughout all of them, Agatha stole money from the bank. And if the game didn’t have money, she simply found another way to cheat.
    </p>
<p>
     Even though she wasn’t caught cheating, Agatha did see the others swiping from the bank a few times, but she didn’t say anything. The only person who kept their hands completely clean was Rio. She kept with the natural order of things and played fair the whole time.
    </p>
<p>
     When they played collaborative games, Alice, Jen, and Lilia formed a team against Agatha and Rio. They argued that Agatha and Rio were more in tune with each other because they were dating, so it gave them a natural advantage.
    </p>
<p>
     Not wanting to give them any reason to raise suspicion, Agatha quickly adapted to Rio’s unorthodox, yet effective game strategies to keep up the ruse. She couldn’t remember the last time she played something so long without cheating.
    </p>
<p>
     By lunchtime, they were all sore from sitting at the table for so long, and after finishing up an intense game of three on two Battleship, the five of them decided to venture outside.
    </p>
<p>
     They went to grab their coats from their bedrooms, but Lilia paused in the hallway, glancing back to the table.
    </p>
<p>
     “Someone should probably clean up the games before we go out,” she said.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not it,” Alice said quickly, touching her nose.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think Agatha and Rio should since they were completely destroyed in Battleship,” Jen grinned.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia seconded her suggestion. “Losers clean up sounds good to me.”
    </p>
<p>
     The three of them continued on to fetch their coats while Agatha plodded back to the table, Rio close behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     “This is why you have to look at their ship placement,” Agatha grumbled, tossing plastic game pieces into the box. “Otherwise you get stuck on cleaning duty.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed. “It’s really not that bad.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha huffed, and they finished cleaning up in silence. By the time they were done, the other three had already put on their coats and were walking out the door. Agatha stacked the game boxes on the counter, finally finished.
    </p>
<p>
     “You want me to grab your coat in the bedroom?” Agatha offered.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, mine’s out here. Thanks, though.” Rio pointed to the coat hook in the living room where her jacket hung.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded and jogged back to their bedroom. She grabbed her coat from the closet, about to leave the room when she saw what was on the nightstand. Rolling her eyes, Agatha sighed and picked up Rio’s gloves, shoving them into her pocket.
    </p>
<p>
     She returned to the living room and held the gloves out like a gun. “Put ‘em up!” Agatha exclaimed, pointing her fake pistol at Rio’s chest.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s hands flew up, playing along, and she smiled when she saw that Agatha had her gloves. “You caught me, Harkness.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha put on her best old Western movie sheriff voice and said, “That’s Officer Harkness to you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Ah, shut up.” Rio swiped the gloves from Agatha’s hand and put them on. When they stepped outside, Rio braced herself and shrank into her jacket, cold wind hitting her face. “Why do your friends like being frozen so much?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged, bending down to pick up a handful of snow. “Beats me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Before Rio could realize what was happening, a snowball landed square on her back. She let out a shriek of surprise. When she turned around to find a smirking Agatha, a fresh snowball sitting innocently in her hand, Rio let out a hearty laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     “So that’s how you wanna play, is it?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked around with mock confusion, pointing at herself with a “Who me?” gesture. Not a second later, she let the snowball fly through the air.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio dropped to the ground to dodge. Snow invaded her collar but the cold didn’t matter anymore. She haphazardly formed a ball of snow between her hands as she got up, launching it at Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sidestepped the projectile, and Rio saw disaster forming moments before it struck.
    </p>
<p>
     “ACK!” Jen yelped, snowball hitting the back of her head. She turned around, a challenge-fueled grin spreading wide across her face. “It. Is. On.”
    </p>
<p>
     Now a team, Agatha and Jen joined forces, making and throwing so many snowballs at Rio that she had to run and hide behind a tree. Agatha laughed as she heard Rio’s call for help.
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh, Alice? Lilia?” She peeked her head out. “Little help please?”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice and Lilia bent down to pick up snow, throwing it at Jen and Agatha. It wasn’t long before they were all running and screaming as snowballs flew through the air. Agatha had taken her fair share of hits, but she had also landed quite a few. Circular white outlines of snowballs dotted the jackets of her opponents.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on, Agatha!” Jen said. She was winded from the snowball fight but still found the energy to scold Agatha. “I don’t care if Rio is your girlfriend. You have to actually throw snowballs at her.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I am.” Agatha said as she threw another snowball. It missed by almost two feet.
    </p>
<p>
     “You have to make the shots.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I am!”
    </p>
<p>
     “You can’t go easy on her just ‘cause she’s your girlfriend. Don’t go soft on me now.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha bent down to collect a fresh handful of snow. “I’m not—” she cocked her arm back and threw the snowball— “going soft.”
    </p>
<p>
     It soared through the air, headed straight to Rio’s chest. At the last second, Rio tried to duck under it, and the snowball landed directly in her face.
    </p>
<p>
     “Shit!” Rio yelped, grabbing her mouth. “Harkness!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrank into herself, an embarrassed smile forming on her lips. “Sorry! You good?”
    </p>
<p>
     “She finally makes a shot and apologizes immediately,” Jen mumbled, shaking her head.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I think so.” Rio moved her hand away from her mouth, and her eyes widened at what she saw. “Actually, I think my lip is bleeding.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You wanna go back inside?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No…” Rio ran her tongue over her lip to feel the cut. She wiped her gloved hand over the area, and it came away stained red. “You know what, yeah. That’s probably a good idea.”
    </p>
<p>
     The snowball crossfire paused while Rio crossed the yard. Once she and Agatha were out of the way, it resumed, and they went into the cabin.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha went to the freezer and pulled out a bag of frozen vegetables. “Sit down,” she ordered, pointing to the table and tossing the bag to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio obeyed and pressed the bag to her lip.
    </p>
<p>
     Watching Rio’s every movement from the corner of her eye, Agatha turned to the kitchen to make hot cocoa. Every few seconds, she glanced back to check that the bag never left Rio’s lip. When Rio noticed what Agatha was doing, she rolled her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Would you stop staring at me? I’m fine.”
    </p>
<p>
     The microwave beeped, and Agatha removed the mugs. “Just making sure you don’t take that ice off your lip.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m pretty sure ice on my lip is what caused this problem in the first place.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took a seat next to Rio and set the two mugs of hot cocoa down between them. Without warning, she gently moved the frozen vegetables away from Rio’s face. “Here, let me see that,” she whispered, leaning closer.
    </p>
<p>
     Carefully, Agatha ran her thumb over Rio’s lip, cradling her chin in her hand as she did. Agatha studied the cut intently. Rio tried to shrink away from her touch and enduring gaze but Agatha’s surprisingly firm grip on her jaw didn't let her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Does it hurt?” Agatha asked, unaware of how close she was to Rio’s face.
    </p>
<p>
     A slight shake of her head was the response. “No,” she said quietly.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sorry,” Agatha said after a second, her tone sincere. “Didn’t mean to hit you in the face.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Aw, look who’s going soft now,” Rio teased. Her grin caused her lip to pull apart, the cut stinging, and she softened her expression to stop the light pain.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave her a deadpan look. “Shut up, Jen.” She let go of Rio’s face and handed her a mug. “Drink your damn hot chocolate and stop talking.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio chuckled, the sound low and warm, as Agatha took a sip of her drink. She glanced back up at Rio, and her gaze lingered there just a moment too long. Agatha averted her gaze and tried to tell herself that the warmth in her chest was simply the hot chocolate.

<p>
     Eventually Jen, Alice, and Lilia were driven back inside when the snow picked up again. They found Agatha and Rio sitting at the table sipping on hot chocolate and joined them.
    </p>
<p>
     Their coming inside had brought in the crisp scent of winter as the sounds of them taking off their coats and boots filled the room. The commotion made Agatha wish they had stayed outside just a little longer. She wanted to go back to the easy quiet between her and Rio before they had all barged in, but she guessed that wasn’t really an option now.
    </p>
<p>
     In the time between Agatha and Rio going inside and the others following, Agatha kept careful watch over Rio to make sure she took good care of her split lip, but for some reason, Rio seemed to shy away from Agatha doting on her. Nevertheless, she kept it up.
    </p>
<p>
     The sound of a log being thrown onto the fire came from the living room and drew Agatha’s mind from thinking about Rio. She glanced back, watching the orange cloud of sparks quickly dissipate.
    </p>
<p>
     “That was our last log in here,” Alice announced. “There’s more outside if someone wants to grab some.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha can,” Rio offered.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sent her an annoyed look for forcibly volunteering her, but Rio simply rolled her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “They were just outside, and I’m injured.” She gestured dramatically to her lip. “You’re the best candidate.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re the best candidate,” Agatha mocked in a high pitched voice, putting her coat back on.
    </p>
<p>
     She sighed as she stepped into the snow again, hating that the sun was already setting. Logically, she knew the day wasn’t over yet, but once it got dark, it felt like it was. She wanted this trip to go slower so she would have more time to spend with Rio, to annoy her. It was difficult to do that when the sun itself seemed to be against the very idea.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha spotted the stack of wood Alice had referenced, protected from the snow by a small structure, but when she approached it, she saw that none of them were cut into pieces. They were all full logs.
    </p>
<p>
     She glanced around, unsure of what to do next, and saw an axe leaning on the side of the structure.
    </p>
<p>
     “You have got to be kidding me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked around again and saw a cylindrical shape buried in snow. She brushed it off and found a wood splitting block underneath. With an exaggerated exhale, Agatha heaved a log onto the chopping block and grabbed the axe. Her hands flexed against the handle as she took a step back and raised it above her head.
    </p>
<p>
     “Here goes nothing.”
    </p>
<p>
     She brought the axe down with all her might, and it landed in the log with a dissatisfying thump, nowhere near a clean cut. More of a dent if anything. Agatha wrenched it out and tried again, getting the same result.
    </p>
<p>
     After a few more attempts, a couple of wood chips had flown off the log, leaving behind a sizable crack, but there was still far to go. Agatha inspected the log to see how much was still uncut.  She let out a tired sigh when she found she wasn’t even a quarter of the way through yet.
    </p>
<p>
     At her next swing, Agatha heard muffled laughter from behind her. She whipped around, brandishing the axe.
    </p>
<p>
     “Woah, careful there,” Rio chuckled. “You’re gonna hit someone. Don’t want anyone to lose their head.”
    </p>
<p>
     “How long have you been there?” Agatha demanded. The embarrassment of her failed wood chopping attempts burned on her cheeks.
    </p>
<p>
     “Long enough.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stepped into the snow and held out her hand. Agatha didn’t want to give her the axe, but the burning in her shoulders told her otherwise. Reluctantly, she handed it over. At least Rio had the common sense to put on gloves this time.
    </p>
<p>
     “Where is your ice pack?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Jen’s currently making dinner with it.” Rio positioned herself in front of the chopping block. “So you kind of have the right idea, but you’re doing all the work. Let the axe do it for you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio readjusted the log, took a wide stance, and swung down the axe with stunning precision. The log split clean in half. Agatha’s eyes widened, and she felt herself blush, immediately trying to stuff it down. Rio picked up the two halves of the log and showed them to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Also, you were trying to cut right at this knot.” She pointed to the log and traced the edge of the knot. “That made your job way harder than it had to be.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks,” Agatha said, clipped.
    </p>
<p>
     She tried to take the log halves, but Rio clicked her tongue, setting them on the chopping block. Two more swings and Rio split them both in half again. She picked up all four pieces and stacked them in Agatha’s arms. Before Agatha could protest being used like a human shelf, Rio shushed her, putting a single finger over her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio then put another log on the block, repeating the process a second time. Agatha watched her silently, mesmerized by her expert movements. Her mind vaguely drifted to thinking about the toned biceps Rio must have hidden beneath her jacket, but she quickly shook herself out of that. She shrugged her arms to get a better grip on the logs and willed her thoughts to go anywhere else.
    </p>
<p>
     Somewhere in her brain fog, Rio had stacked the other logs in her arms and had started back to the house, pausing when Agatha didn’t follow.
    </p>
<p>
     “You coming?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha startled. “Uh, yeah. Yeah.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave her a pensive look before shaking her head, laughing lightly. “Where do you go, Harkness?”
    </p>
<p>
     Back inside, Agatha stacked the wood next to the fireplace and took a seat next to Rio at the table. It wasn’t long before dinner was ready, and they gathered to eat and drink. Afterwards, they settled onto the couch, but couldn’t find anything interesting on the TV to watch.
    </p>
<p>
     “We could play a game. Like never have I ever or something like that,” Alice suggested and the others nodded in agreement.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do we want to use beer or should I go grab shot glasses?” Lilia asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “We already have beer so let’s just do that,” Agatha replied, swirling the liquid around in her bottle.
    </p>
<p>
     They moved in closer to the coffee table and let the game commence. Since it was her suggestion, Alice went first.
    </p>
<p>
     “Never have I ever broken a bone.”
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio and Lilia drank, Agatha scoffed. “That’s such a boring one.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice shrugged. “I’m starting off easy. We already know you’ve done all the worst ones.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I have not,” Agatha said, aghast, her hand flying to her chest in mock offense.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pat her gently on the leg. “It’s alright, Harkness. I’ll help you out: never have I ever gotten in a physical fight.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pursed her lips. “I see how this is going.” She took a sip glaring at Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hold on,” Jen interjected. “I’m not that surprised you’ve punched someone, but why haven’t I heard the story before?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rules are I have to drink, not explain,” Agatha said.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia shushed them with her hands. “I’m next. Never have I ever hooked up with a stranger.”
    </p>
<p>
     Everyone except Lilia drank, though Jen and Rio seemed more reluctant to admitting it. Lilia’s jaw dropped at seeing all four of them drinking.
    </p>
<p>
     “You animals!” she exclaimed.
    </p>
<p>
     They continued on for a few more rounds, and once they all finished their beer, Lilia brought back a handful of shot glasses instead of a six pack. From there, the game soon devolved to more and more inane questions, and true to Alice’s prediction, Agatha found herself drinking more than anyone else.
    </p>
<p>
     What surprised her, though, was how much Rio drank. Granted, she hadn’t done most of the extreme stuff, but there were definitely quite a few that shocked Agatha. Like when she toilet papered her neighbors house, apparently blaming it on their kids. Or when she joined the mile high club, only for the other girl to break up with her once their flight landed.
    </p>
<p>
     It revealed a whole new side of Rio that Agatha was more than happy to get to know.
    </p>
<p>
     At some point, Agatha noticed that Rio had grown quiet. She was still drinking periodically, but she hadn’t offered a prompt for a while. Agatha pointed the neck of her bottle at her. “You. Your turn.”
    </p>
<p>
     The subsequent smirk on Rio’s face should have scared Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay,” she drawled. “Never have I ever pretended to date someone for my own benefit.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha, even while tipsy, somehow had the sense not to strangle Rio right then and there.
    </p>
<p>
     “I told you about that in confidence!” she exclaimed, carefully walking the line between her real and fake anger with exaggerated expressions.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio happily poured Agatha another shot and slid it across the table. “Oh, relax. I know it happened a long time ago.” She kissed Agatha on the cheek. “Drink up, babe.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha begrudgingly downed the shot, secretly happy Rio had provided her with a viable cover story. Even so, she wasn’t planning on letting her get away with that so easily. She pushed away the empty shot glass and sat up a little straighter.
    </p>
<p>
     “My turn.” She tilted her head to Rio, raising her eyebrows in a silent challenge. “Never have I ever got an award for the fastest time in an agility training course, fell off the stage when my boss tried to give me the plaque, broke my wrist, and refused to go to the hospital until two days later.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You little—”
    </p>
<p>
     “Drink up, babe,” Agatha sang.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait, is that what you drank to earlier when you said you broke a bone?” Lilia asked, laughing.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pursed her lips, ignoring the question, and just as Agatha had, she glared at her before, during, and after taking the shot. Agatha was just happy to expose some of Rio’s secrets after she nearly exposed their lie right in front of everyone.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio set down the shot glass with a solid thud. “You know what, never have I—”
    </p>
<p>
     “What if we switch games?” Alice interrupted. “Before someone loses their head.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grumbled but backed down. “Fine by me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Same here,” Agatha added.
    </p>
<p>
     “How about truth or dare?” Jen said.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine by me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Same here.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen rolled her eyes at Agatha and Rio’s childish antics and pulled out her phone to look up some prompts. A minute later, she found a list online. “Alright, Lilia, truth or dare?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Truth.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen scrolled for a few seconds to find a good one. “Okay, who do you think is the most attractive person in our friend group?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Easy: me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Lilia! You can’t pick yourself.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine. You can be second place.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen considered the answer for a moment before straightening her posture. “I will accept that answer.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Does that mean I can ask someone next?” Lilia asked, and Jen nodded. “Okay. Alice, truth or dare?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Dare.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia thought for a second, not looking at the list, before saying, “Call your mom and tell her your pregnant.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice raised her eyebrows, confused. “Okay…” She picked up the phone and dialed, putting it on speaker at Agatha’s prompting. “Uh, hey, Mom.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, kiddo. It’s kind of late. Everything alright?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, everything’s good. I just called you to tell you that I’m, uh, I’m pregnant.”
    </p>
<p>
     There was a beat of silence.
    </p>
<p>
     “Honey, I love you, but you’re a lesbian. You can’t get pregnant. What are you talking about?”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice let out a chuckle. “Just playing truth or dare. Thanks, Mom.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, okay. Be careful. I love you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice hung up the phone and turned back to Lilia with a smile on her face. “What did you expect to happen there?” Lilia shrugged. “Whatever. Rio, you’re up next.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio seemed caught off guard to be brought into the game so early on. Being the newbie of the group, she had gotten used to being picked last. Agatha noticed her nervousness and put her arm around Rio’s waist, pulling her closer.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t worry. I’ll fight Alice if you don’t like what she tells you,” she said. And as if to seal her promise, Agatha planted a kiss on Rio’s temple.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s not going to be that bad,” Alice argued. “Rio, do you want truth or dare?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Truth, please.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice grinned. “What’s your least favorite thing about dating Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Stand down, Harkness,” Rio joked, patting Agatha’s knee to stop her from saying anything. Even after she relaxed, Rio still kept her hand resting on Agatha’s leg. “I don’t know… That’s kind of a hard question. I like everything about her now, but our first date was a bit strange.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Do tell,” Lilia said, leaning in like this was the latest gossip in town.
    </p>
<p>
     This time, it was Agatha’s turn to be nervous. She sent Rio a glance, silently asking for her imminent improv session not to make her look too bad. Rio gave Agatha’s leg a reassuring squeeze.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, we knew each other at work for a while, were strictly coworkers for that time. But then we kind of got roped into a double date with our friend Wanda and her husband and—”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait, you weren’t dating, but you went on a double date?” Alice asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh, yes. We both thought it was just a hang out, but then at dinner that night, Vision— that’s Wanda’s husband— asked us if we were dating and for some reason Agatha said yes. So then we pretended to for the rest of that night, and as we were leaving, Agatha asked me out on a real date. Not exactly your typical romance, we were a bit clunky, but overall, it worked out.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled at Agatha, the kind of genuine smile that gave her butterflies, and Agatha let out a mental sigh of relief. The best lies were close to the truth, and Rio was leading them all in a master class. Agatha was impressed.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s a cute story, though,” Lilia said, looking at Rio and Agatha with a loving expression.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio brushed off the comment with a little shoulder shrug that Agatha thought was adorable, and she brought the conversation back to their game. “Jen, you haven’t done one yet. Truth or dare?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not letting any of you embarrass me, so truth.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No embarrassment, huh?” Rio smirked. “Would you rather have everyone be able to read your mind or everyone you know have access to your search history?”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen laughed, thinking for a second. “Read my mind. Because then I wouldn’t have to tell people what’s wrong with their outfit. They’d already know.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s in your search history you’re trying to hide?” Agatha said, wiggling her eyebrows.
    </p>
<p>
     “None of any of your businesses,” she replied, pointing around the group. “Lilia, I’m picking you again.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Truth.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Again? Okay, but just don’t pick yourself this time.” Jen scrolled for a few seconds before finding a question. “What’s the most illegal thing you’ve done?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hmm, well, I did flash a guy once when I was younger. Don’t know if that was illegal, but I think I scared him,” Lilia laughed, thinking back on the memory. “Oh, I also swiped a couple things from a store one Black Friday during the mad rush. Then there was that one time—” Lilia cut herself off, biting her knuckle. “Actually, nevermind. Whose turn is next?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised her hand. “I’m offended none of you have asked me yet.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia sighed and shook her head. “Would you like a truth or a dare, Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Dare, please. Since all of you old crones keep picking truth, I will be the only interesting person and pick dare.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I was hoping you’d say that.” Lilia rubbed her hands together menacingly.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha chuckled, glancing back at Rio. “Should I be worried?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Nonsense,” Lilia said. “My dare for you is to kiss Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s… not really a dare, Lilia. I mean, I literally kissed her a couple minutes ago.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, I know that,” Lilia waved her hand, “but I haven’t seen the two of you kiss on the lips yet.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Is this really the dare you’re giving me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, she gave you the dare. That means you have to do it,” Alice said. “You’re bound by the high laws of truth or dare.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You must complete the task or leave in shame,” Jen added dramatically.
    </p>
<p>
     “Come on, just humor me,” Lilia smiled. “I’m a hopeless romantic, and you two are adorable.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had a moment of internal regret for choosing dare, not wanting to force Rio to do this if she didn’t want to, and she met Rio’s eyes, searching for confirmation. Rio gave her the subtlest nod.
    </p>
<p>
     Here goes nothing, Agatha thought to herself.
    </p>
<p>
     Leaning in, her heart suddenly thundered in her chest. Agatha’s mind finally registered what was actually happening, but by that point it was too late. Her breath mingled with Rio’s right as their lips met. The kiss started off hesitant, unsure, but then it began to deepen into something more, a spark igniting in Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Her hands gravitated to cradle Rio’s face, and the warmth she felt sent a shiver through her. She tilted her head to get a better angle, and her cautious movements soon became instinctual.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s hands latched firmly to Agatha’s wrists as if to anchor them both. They were pulled closer still by some invisible force, and Agatha felt her pulse quicken at the intensity of the kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     The sound of her friends whooping at the spectacle became nothing but muffled background noise, swallowed by the pounding in Agatha’s ears. The only sensation she could focus on was Rio’s lips against hers, soft yet impossibly urgent.
    </p>
<p>
     When they finally broke apart, Agatha struggled to catch her breath, chest rising and falling. She was all too aware of the bright crimson on her cheeks, and when she looked back at Rio, she found the same color. Their wide eyes met, countless emotions transmitted through the space between them in that single look.
    </p>
<p>
     And for a second, they simply stared at each other, each trying to decipher what the other was thinking. Neither could.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s finger twitched, and she realized it was still hovering near Rio’s face. She quickly dropped her hand.
    </p>
<p>
     Tearing her gaze away, Agatha forced a shaky smile, heart still pounding against her ribs, and as her pulse slowly came back down, she still couldn’t focus.
    </p>
<p>
     Her surroundings slowly came back to her— fragments of her friends’ teasing voices, the heat of the fire, the light buzz of alcohol coursing through her veins— but Agatha’s thoughts were still a muddled, fuzzy blur. Only one managed to rise above the cacophony, echoing louder and louder:
    </p>
<p>
     What the fuck was that?!

<p>
     Agatha leaned closer to the bathroom mirror, opening her eyes wide, mascara wand in her hand. Behind her, Rio sat on the edge of the bathtub pinning her hair up.
    </p>
<p>
     One advantage of them getting the master bedroom was the en suite bathroom. Or, it would be an advantage if it wasn’t one of the smallest bathrooms Agatha had ever been in. There was enough room for two people to stand up straight, nothing more, and it made getting ready for the day a very cramped, shoulder to shoulder procedure.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stood halfway and reached past Agatha to set her brush down on the vanity, resting her hand on Agatha’s shoulder for balance. When she sat back down, she met Agatha’s gaze in the mirror.
    </p>
<p>
     “So… should we talk about last night?” She cleared her throat. “About the kiss.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha jumped, and a black smudge of mascara smeared beneath her eyebrow. She forced a laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s there to talk about?” she feigned.
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh, well, it was a little intense, and—”
    </p>
<p>
     Worry flashed across Agatha’s face. “Was it too much? I’m sorry.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, no, no,” Rio said quickly, waving her hands in reassurance “It was fine. It- It was-” She cut herself off. “You’re fine.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh,” Agatha smiled, relieved. “Then what’s there to talk about?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio closed her eyes and bit her lip, looking forlorn. “Nothing. Forget it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked at herself in the mirror and realized there was mascara on her brow. Sensing the opportunity to change the subject, she glanced back at Rio and asked, “You got a makeup wipe?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hmm?” Rio shook herself out of a trance. “Yeah. Let me just…”
    </p>
<p>
     Her voice trailed off as she searched through her toiletries bag and pulled out a wipe, handing it to Agatha. Agatha thanked her and fixed her mascara. She quickly finished applying the rest of her makeup, much faster than she normally would, and skirted out of the bathroom as soon as she could.
    </p>
<p>
     Something in the back of Agatha’s mind told her that was a close one, but to what, she did not know.
    </p>
<p>
     Before she stepped out into the kitchen, Agatha took a moment to herself, straightening out her clothes and brushing off the effects of her and Rio’s conversation. A few seconds later, confidence restored, she stepped into the kitchen where Jen, Lilia, and Alice gathered around the little radio at the table.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, great news!” Lilia said, waving her over. “The roads are finally cleared after that snowstorm. We can leave the house again.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s good, but why are you so excited?” Agatha sat down beside them. “I thought today’s plan was hiking. Don’t you hate hiking?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s really not that bad,” Alice mumbled, crossing her arms.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not talking about that. I’m talking about the little Christmas gift I arranged for you and Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     At that moment, Rio entered the room looking like a startled deer, and when Lilia motioned for her to come over, it took her a second to comprehend the request.
    </p>
<p>
     “Vidal,” Agatha said softly, and Rio snapped out of it.
    </p>
<p>
     She shuffled over to the table and sat down next to Agatha, the only remaining free chair. Their knees brushed together beneath the table.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, you’re both here, so I can tell you what it is,” Lilia said. “I got the two of you a reservation at this bougie restaurant in town called Amare. Thought it’d be a nice date night for the two of you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia clasped her hands together happily as her words sunk into Agatha’s mind. She felt her heart rate spike, like it had right before last night’s kiss, and instinctively put on a courteous smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s so sweet of you, Lilia. Thank you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s from all of us,” Jen added.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, buck off! This was my idea, and you refused to call the place when I asked you,” Lilia argued.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, either way, thank you,” Rio said with a shaky laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     She glanced at Agatha, and their eyes met. Agatha could tell by her subtle facial twitches that Rio was trying to stifle a growing nervousness. She tried to give her a reassuring smile and reached under the table to rest her hand on Rio’s leg, gently rubbing her thumb to calm her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio must have been more tense than she let on, though. The moment she felt the touch, her hand grappled into Agatha’s. Startled by the impulse but trying not to show it, Agatha squeezed her hand. Rio squeezed back, their fingers intertwined.
    </p>
<p>
     The others didn’t seem to notice their silent exchange, and Lilia pressed on about the specifics of their upcoming date. She rattled off the time and address, details which were quickly forgotten by Agatha, her mind occupied elsewhere.
    </p>
<p>
     Anchored by Rio’s hand in hers, Agatha was eventually able to rejoin the conversation, her wits fully restored. They chatted for a while before Alice got up, ordering everyone to get dressed. Only after they stood from the table did Rio finally let go of Agatha’s hand.
    </p>
<p>
     Not that Agatha minded.
    </p>
<p>
     They all sequestered themselves to their rooms and reemerged a little later donning their most outdoorsy outfits, ready to go hiking. Before they left, Agatha double checked that Rio had everything she needed to stay warm, grabbing her an extra pack of hand warmers just in case.
    </p>
<p>
     — — —
    </p>
<p>
     By the time they had hiked up and back down the mountain, Rio seemed to have recovered from whatever weird mood she was in earlier.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha, for one, was happy to see her back to herself, reasoning that she had just needed a breath of fresh air. Lord knows how much time they had spent inside, playing those silly little games like Truth or Dare. It was good to get out once in a while.
    </p>
<p>
     As Alice pulled the car back into the driveway, Jen turned from the passenger seat to look at Agatha and Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “You two should probably start getting ready for your date. Which I helped plan.” She sent a pointed look at Lilia. “Your reservation is in about an hour and a half.
    </p>
<p>
     Right, Agatha thought. That. The date.
    </p>
<p>
     She wondered if there was a polite way to decline going. Probably not. At least, not without raising suspicion.
    </p>
<p>
     They all made their way back inside, and Agatha and Rio went to change into something somewhat nicer for their fake date. Agatha picked up on Rio’s body language and could tell she was getting a little nervous again, but a reassuring word and hand on her shoulder helped Rio relax.
    </p>
<p>
     After changing, they went out to the living room to find the others lined up on the couch like a panel of judges. Apparently, they were there to vet their outfits, and Lilia was the first to object.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nope. Go back.” She made a circular motion with her finger. “Amare is way fancier than whatever you two have going on.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What is wrong with this?” Agatha looked down at her outfit: dark jeans and a fitted sweater. “This is nice.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe for a dinner party at your boss’s house,” Alice said.
    </p>
<p>
     She tapped her phone a few times and turned the screen to show a picture of the restaurant’s interior. As soon as Agatha saw it, she knew she had to bring her outfit up a few notches.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ok,” Agatha said, mind already whirring with ideas, “give me a sec.”
    </p>
<p>
     She grabbed Rio’s hand and pulled her back to the bedroom.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time they were both changed, the room looked like a tornado of clothes, but Agatha felt confident in her new outfit. She twirled around, letting the skirt of her dress float up. When she stopped spinning, her smile was delirious with excitement and laughter.
    </p>
<p>
     What she didn’t notice was Rio watching her out of the corner of her eye, a small smile tugging at the corner of her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     “Now this is what I’m talking about,” Lilia said as they entered the living room. She leaned back to get a better view, nodding as she did. “You both look great.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grinned at Rio, admiring her outfit. She shifted her weight to her back foot and looked Rio up and down. She wore sleek black dress pants, a fitted black blazer, and a button up white blouse with two buttons undone.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha couldn’t help but admit that Rio looked hot.
    </p>
<p>
     Her mind screeched to a halt.
    </p>
<p>
     Pretty. Rio looked pretty. Cute. Good. Great. All of those were better adjectives. Her mind scrambled to find more alternatives. Nice. Striking. Attractive.
    </p>
<p>
     Wait, no. Agatha stopped herself. That- that wasn’t what she was supposed to be thinking.
    </p>
<p>
     “You look great, Harkness,” Rio said, yanking Agatha’s attention back. “Wasn’t expecting you to pull out a dress, but you make it work.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grinned, praying her voice wouldn’t crack when she spoke. “Don’t know if that’s a compliment or not, but thanks.”
    </p>
<p>
     She took to smoothing out the nonexistent wrinkles in her dress to occupy her hands. She was just wearing a regular black dress that she’d owned longer than she cared to count. It was her go-to for formal events; simple, yet elegant enough to pass.
    </p>
<p>
     To Agatha, it was the most ordinary piece of clothing, but something stirred inside her when Rio complimented it.
    </p>
<p>
     “You look good, too,” Agatha added. She cleared her throat. “Should we go now?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio checked her phone. “Oh, yeah. Our reservation is soon.”
    </p>
<p>
     At that, Lilia practically shoved them out the door, and she was on the porch waving as the car pulled out of the driveway.
    </p>
<p>
     “Have fun, lovebirds!” she shouted after them.
    </p>

     The drive to Amare was largely uneventful, something Agatha was grateful for. It helped that she was forced to keep her eyes on the road, on the lookout for rogue deer, so she couldn’t glance over at Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     They made their way into the restaurant, entering the warm ambiance, and the host led them to a table for two in the center of the room.
    </p>
<p>
     “Dang, Lilia was right. We would have been fish out of water with our first outfit choice,” Agatha joked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” Rio trailed off. She stared blankly into the distance and anxiously drummed her fingers on the edge of the menu.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha kicked her under the table. “Relax, Vidal. This doesn’t have to be weird. We’re just two friends having dinner. If anything, we should try to take advantage of tonight because we don’t have to be putting on a show or anything.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Right,” Rio said, smiling a little. “We can just be ourselves.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Exactly.” Agatha pointed double finger guns at her and opened the menu. “Now, what are we ordering?”
    </p>
<p>
     They browsed the menu for a bit and placed their orders when the waiter came back, but  once the menus were gone, the conversation lulled.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha glanced around the restaurant before jumping back into action. “So where were you born?” Rio gave her a confused look, and Agatha just shrugged. “I don’t know, small talk.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Near Death Valley, in California.” Rio reclined slightly in her chair, at ease once again.
    </p>
<p>
     “How’d you end up in Westview then? That’s a ways away.”
    </p>
<p>
     “School. I wanted to go to college as far away from my parents as possible.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Here, here.” Agatha raised her glass. “I know the feeling. Unfortunately, I was not able to switch oceans to escape my mother.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio rested her chin in her hand. “Why? Where were you born?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Salem, Massachusetts. I have barely five hours separating me and the devil herself.”
    </p>
<p>
     She laughed, the sound clear and bright. “Okay, my turn to ask a question. If you could have any superpower, which one would you pick?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Magic,” Agatha answered easily.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio squinted at her across the table, tilting her head. “I don’t know if that counts as a superpower.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Look who’s boring. Alright, fine. My power is to siphon everybody else’s and take it for my own.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Why would you want to do that?” Rio thought for a second, then reconsidered. “Actually, that would be kind of cool. All they would have to do is, like, blast you with their light beams or whatever and then you’d take it from them.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded like she’d known she was right the whole time. “Exactly. What’s your pick?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Control over life and death.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Dramatic much? Agatha mumbled.
    </p>
<p>
     “Either that or plant magic.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I thought magic didn’t count as a superpower?” Agatha teased.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio straightened in her seat and pushed her sleeves up past her elbows. “Hey, I don’t know. I’m not that big of a superhero fan anyway. I’ve always liked comedy sitcoms more than those dude-bro movies.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s eyes lingered on Rio’s exposed forearms for a moment before snapping back to attention.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I’ve seen a couple of those. They’re funny. So what else do you do outside work besides trash talking Superman?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio rolled her eyes, laughing. “I’ve got a decent collection of knives and daggers. I spend more time practicing my throwing knives than I’d like to admit.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Throwing knives? Really? You’re full of surprises, aren’t you, Vidal,” Agatha asked, a soft smile forming. “What’s your favorite knife you have?”
    </p>
<p>
     Excitement overtook Rio’s face, and she practically bounced up and down in her seat like a giddy little kid. “You have no idea the can of worms you just opened.” She took a breath. “Okay, so-”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned back and listened to Rio ramble on about knives for an insane amount of time. She didn’t mind, though. Just seeing Rio’s enthusiasm was enough to keep her interested in the conversation. She loved the little inflections in her voice when she got excited and how her nose would scrunch up a little when she talked about bad knives, a thing Agatha never knew existed until tonight.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s all amazing, but you still haven’t answered the original question,” Agatha grinned. “Which one is your favorite?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, easy.” Rio pulled out her phone and turned it to show Agatha a picture of a curved dagger.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha let out a whistle. “She looks sharp.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded, eyes widened for emphasis. “She is.” She put away her phone and rolled her shoulders forward in a cute little hunch, smiling at the table. When Rio looked back up, she had a bashful expression on her face, a light blush dusting her cheeks. “Sorry. I’ve been talking for so long. What do you like to do?”
    </p>
<p>
     Before Agatha could answer, the waiter appeared beside their table with two plates of food in his arms.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good evening, ma’am, ma’am. We’ve got your pan seared chicken. Careful, it’s still hot,” he set the plate in front of Agatha, “and a roasted salmon for the other half.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha and Rio exchanged a knowing look, not expecting the waiter to mistake them for partners, as he kept talking about the food.
    </p>
<p>
     “And I know that when you made your reservation, you asked us to make sure we had heart shaped lava cake available. We do, so I can bring that out after this course or whenever you’re ready for dessert.”
    </p>
<p>
     Their eyes met across the table, and at the same time, they said, “Lilia.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked back at the waiter. “That would be great, thank you.”
    </p>
<p>
     The waiter nodded and left their table. Agatha and Rio dug into their food. After a minute, Agatha remembered Rio’s question before the waiter interrupted them.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t really have many hobbies, but I do have a rabbit.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, cute. What’s his name?”
    </p>
<p>
     ”Señor Scratchy.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you drop him off at Wanda’s or something for this trip?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yup.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded, taking a bite of her fish, and the conversation came to a lull. It was quiet for a few seconds until Agatha suddenly looked up from her plate.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, I meant to tell you this earlier, but I didn’t get the chance. That was a pretty good story you came up with about our ‘first date’.” She made air quotes around the words.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ha, thanks.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You managed to pull it off last night, but we might end up like Icarus if we keep talking about faking this.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Noted,” Rio grinned. “I’ll keep it to a minimum.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Much appreciated.” Agatha leaned back in her chair and thought for a moment. “You know, I don’t even remember the last time I had dinner with Wanda and Vis without those infernal twins around.”
    </p>
<p>
     “They’re not that bad. Besides, I’ve seen you at their yearly Fourth of July barbecue. You definitely have a soft spot for Billy.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha crossed her arms childishly. “More like he follows me around all day,” she mumbled.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio poked Agatha’s leg with her foot. “You are so stubborn, you know that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Am not.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure…” Rio nodded skeptically. “So, would you ever want your own little cookie cutter family like the Maximoffs? Get a couple rugrats running around?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe one. But I wouldn’t know the first thing about being a good mom. Not based off my own mother.”
    </p>
<p>
     Before Rio could respond, an old woman approached their table.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha? Is that you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha spun around in her chair and immediately felt a pit of dread solidify in her stomach.
    </p>
<p>
     “Speak of the devil, and she will appear,” Agatha whispered.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked confused for a moment. “Wait, is that—”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi, Mom!” Agatha said, sarcastic and syrupy sweet. “What a great coincidence to see you here!”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s been a long time,” Evanora said, her tone clipped. She stopped in front of their table and stood stiffly with her hands clasped in front of her. “How have you been?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha avoided eye contact and kept her answer as short as possible. “Good. You?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Good, good. Still doing the Lord’s work. My church group and I came down from Salem to help spread His word over Christmas.” Her lips formed a tight smile. “Just bringing a little light to the lost.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hallelujah. A Christmas miracle.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha.” Evanora’s smile vanished. “Watch your tongue. It’s unbecoming to talk like that in God’s house.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha finally met her eyes, gesturing angrily around herself. “This isn’t God’s house, Mom. This is some random restaurant.”
    </p>
<p>
     Evanora then turned her attention to Rio, and her expression soured further as she took in Rio’s masculine outfit and dark makeup. “And this is…”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio. My friend. We’re having dinner.”
    </p>
<p>
     Evanora ignored her and addressed Rio directly, voice dripping with disdain. “I’m sure you’ve had a very… interesting influence on my daughter.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow but stayed quiet, glancing at Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s jaw tightened. “She’s my friend, Mom. That’s all you need to know.”
    </p>
<p>
     Evanora laughed, cold and humorless. “Friend? Don’t insult my intelligence. I can see what this really is. You may have turned your back on God, but I haven’t.” She pursed her lips, the lines in her forehead growing deeper with scorn. “I pray for you everyday that one day you’ll find your way back from this… this lifestyle you’ve chosen.”
    </p>
<p>
     Evanora glanced down at Agatha’s curled fists on the table and clicked her tongue. “You will see the truth someday.”
    </p>
<p>
     Without another word, she turned on her heel and disappeared into the restaurant.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s hands curled into fists on the table, but she let her walk away. A long, charged moment passed before she abruptly stood and said, “I’m going to the bathroom.”
    </p>
<p>
     She exited the table, keeping her face hidden from Rio as she left. Luckily, the bathrooms weren’t hard to find. She paced back and forth in front of the stall doors, clenching and unclenching her hands.
    </p>
<p>
     She hadn’t even been there for a minute before the door opened cautiously.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s voice sounded across the small space as she stepped into the room. Agatha froze mid-pace and faced Rio. For a moment, Rio just looked at her, Agatha feeling exposed as she scanned her face, like Rio was trying to find something unspoken in her expression.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m sorry you had to see that,” Agatha said quietly.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, don’t be. None of that was your fault,” Rio said, stepping closer. “You okay?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned slightly, crossing her arms as though to shield herself. “Yeah, I’m fine.” Glancing over her shoulder, she added, “You can go back to the table. I’ll be out in a sec.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t want to just leave you here alone.” Rio’s tone was soft but firm as she ventured another step closer to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “I- I’m fine,” she assured her, but her voice cracked. She wavered between shutting Rio out or letting her in.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took another tentative step forward. Her expression softened. “Agatha…”
    </p>
<p>
     Something in Rio’s voice pushed through Agatha’s defenses. She turned toward her, guardrails crumbling down. As soon as she did, Rio closed the distance between them, pulling Agatha into a fierce hug.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stiffened at first, not expecting it, but then something inside her gave way and she hugged Rio back, just as tight. Her resolve melted, and she let out a shaky breath, tension in her shoulders slowly fading.
    </p>
<p>
     The steady rise and fall of Rio’s chest against hers grounded Agatha in a way she hadn’t realized she needed. Rio’s embrace felt safe, and she tightened her grip without thinking.
    </p>
<p>
     “I fucking hate her,” Agatha muttered, her voice muffled by Rio’s shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     They remained locked in the unyielding hug, Rio never faltering once, until Agatha shifted, starting to gently pull back. But even then, her hands lingered around Rio’s waist, while Rio’s stayed loosely draped around her shoulders, neither of them ready to let go.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio carefully brushed a couple strands of hair out of Agatha’s face, her fingers lingering. Her touch was soft, hesitant, but Agatha didn’t dare pull away.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m a mess, aren’t I?” Agatha gave a hollow chuckle, shaking her head.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t say that,” Rio smiled, her eyes soft. “You’re perfect.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took half a step back. “Thanks,” she whispered, her voice gravelly but genuine, and a faint smirk began to tug at her lips. “My mother really took one look at you and thought ‘I found a dyke’.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio playfully pushed her shoulder. “Agatha!”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m just saying,” Agatha said, putting her hands up innocently.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio let out a laugh. “I’m going back to the table.” She held out her arm to Agatha. “If you’d care to join me?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha easily linked her arm in Rio’s. “With pleasure, m’lady.”
    </p>
<p>
     They returned to the table and quickly fell into light conversation. The food was great, and Agatha took no shame in making a toast when Evanora finally left the restaurant.
    </p>
<p>
     She and Rio stayed at their table, enjoying each other’s company, until the waiter came around again to tell them that the restaurant would close in fifteen minutes.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked around and realized that there was hardly anyone left in the dining room. Just one elderly couple sharing dessert in the corner. Agatha hadn’t realized how much time had gone by, but she didn’t regret spending it with Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you still have a lava cake left?” Agatha called out quickly before the waiter walked away. He nodded. “Can we get one of those in a to-go box?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course.”
    </p>
<p>
     The waiter left and soon returned with a white styrofoam box. Agatha helped Rio with her coat before they made their way to the front of the restaurant to pay the check.
    </p>
<p>
     — — —
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha and Rio stumbled back into the cabin, cold air and laughter swirling around them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Shh, shh, shh,” Agatha said, stifling a laugh. “Everyone else is asleep.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re being louder than I am,” Rio whispered loudly.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pushed her hand into Rio’s face. “Shut up, Vidal.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, okay, fine.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio walked into the living room and flopped onto the couch. Agatha grinned, watching her, and grabbed two spoons from the silverware drawer before joining her on the couch. She sat next to Rio with one leg tucked beneath her and opened the to-go box.
    </p>
<p>
     “It might be a little cold now, but cake is cake.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio happily took the spoon Agatha offered her, and they dug into the lava cake. They broke through the outer layer and the inner chocolate spilt out. Agatha dipped her finger in to taste.
    </p>
<p>
     “This is actually really good. Was expecting it to be too sweet, but it’s not. Just the right amount. Here, you should try it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Before Rio could stop her, Agatha scooped up a dollop of the sauce and plopped it on the tip of Rio’s nose. She licked her finger clean and grinned at Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Agatha smiled innocently.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had just opened her mouth to reply when a drip of the sauce landed on her lip. She somehow maintained a poker face as Agatha nearly doubled over with laughter. Rio’s tongue darted out to clean it off.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hmm, you’re right. This is pretty good.” She used her finger to wipe off the rest and pointed it at Agatha, a drip of it threatening to fall off. “But don’t do that again.” Rio’s finger disappeared into her mouth as she licked it clean.
    </p>
<p>
     “As you wish,” Agatha said with a cheeky smile.
    </p>
<p>
     They continued eating the lava cake until there was nothing left, and Agatha dropped the container in the trash and the spoons in the sink. When she returned, Rio was watching her carefully, eyes tracking her every move.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave her a curious look. “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I was just wondering if you’d ever let me in on what’s happening in that head of yours,” Rio said wistfully. “Like, really let me in.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha dropped onto the couch. “You accusing me of lying to you?” she asked with a mischievous tone.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not lying, per se.” Rio took her time to find the right words, speaking slowly when she did. “But maybe, like, withholding information. I don’t know, you just seem different lately.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Trust me, if I’m not telling you something it’s because I don’t know it yet. I love my friends, but for the duration of this trip, you are my sole confidant. You know everything I do.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s answer seemed to assuage Rio, but only slightly. Seeing this, she placed her hand on Rio’s arm, the touch drawing Rio’s attention, and their eyes met.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey,” Agatha said softly, “you good?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio swallowed, then nodded. “Yeah. Yeah, of course.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We don’t have to keep pretending if you don’t want to. If you’re uncomfortable or don’t want to anymore, I can bring you home.”
    </p>
<p>
     Something in Rio shifted, and she was back to her usual self. “What? And miss the chance to embarrass you more? You can’t get rid of me that easily, Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     For a moment, Agatha tilted her head slightly. Something about Rio’s sentence sounded off, but she couldn’t place it. She shook away the thought before Rio could notice anything amiss.
    </p>
<p>
     They settled back into the conversation, words flowing easily between them well into the night, with the topics ranging from the most mundane, everyday questions to deeper queries meant to probe at the other’s soul.
    </p>
<p>
     “If you could change any one thing about yourself,” Agatha asked some time later, mindlessly massaging Rio’s hand, “what would it be and why?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sighed deeply before answering. “I always end up pushing people away, hurting them. I never mean for it to happen, but it always does, like it was baked into my very nature, like some cosmic entity stuck me with a bad omen.” She paused. “I don’t even know how you could change that, but that’s what I’d do.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wow, that’s way better than my answer. I was gonna make myself two inches taller.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Rio snorted. “No, think of a better answer. I did not spill my guts so you could make a cheap joke.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Alright, alright, that’s fair.” Agatha thought for a moment. “I hold grudges too long. I don’t even want to think about all I’ve missed out on because I was still angry and hurt over something that happened years and years ago. Friendships, relationships I’ve lost because I was too in my own head.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio curled her fingers, drawing Agatha’s hand into hers, and Agatha stopped kneading Rio’s palm.
    </p>
<p>
     “If I ever see you holding onto something you shouldn’t, I promise I’ll stop you.” Rio’s eyes bore into Agatha’s like they saw right through her, her gaze suddenly intense.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave a soft smile. “And if anything tries to push me away from you, I won’t let it happen. Not in a million years. I promise.” She gave Rio’s hand a firm squeeze.
    </p>
<p>
     Of course, not all of their conversations were as introspective. They spent a considerable amount of time debating whether pineapple belonged on pizza and still couldn’t come to a consensus.
    </p>
<p>
     As hours flew by, Rio’s eyes started to droop, sleepiness overtaking her. She sank lower and lower into the couch with every passing minute. Agatha asked her a question, but she hardly heard it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Huh? I don’t know,” she mumbled, eyes heavy, words slurring. “I wanna go to sleep.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio began to fluff the pillow beneath her when Agatha’s words stopped her.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you doing? If you’re going to sleep, get over here.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blinked, confused. “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gestured to the hearth. “There’s no fire. It’s too cold in here for you to be over there by yourself.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice probably burned all the logs,” Rio said dismissively. “I mean, we did only cut two. Well, I cut two.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll cut more tomorrow,” Agatha waved her hand, “but in the meantime, hurry up so we can go to sleep.”
    </p>
<p>
     Too tired to protest, Rio obliged. Her movements were hesitant at first, but Agatha impatiently tapping the couch cushion sped her up. Soon, Rio had her back flush against Agatha’s chest, drawn in close by her arm.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you always spoon like you have a stick up your ass?” Agatha chuckled. “God, Vidal, loosen up.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio elbowed her in the ribs. “I am not—”
    </p>
<p>
     “I feel like I’m hugging a two by four,” Agatha interrupted.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shut her mouth, indignant, but Agatha felt her muscles slowly unwind. She waited a few seconds until Rio properly relaxed into her.
    </p>
<p>
     “There. Much better,” Agatha murmured. She lightly kissed Rio’s temple before saying, “Night, Vidal.”
    </p>
<p>
     There was a noticeable pause before Rio responded, “G’night.”

     Agatha woke up the next morning to the smell of breakfast and the sound of festive music. Looking towards the kitchen, she saw Rio dancing around the stove, her movements free and uncaring. Agatha watched her for a few seconds, smiling softly, before she stood from the couch and folded the blanket that had been on her.
    </p>
<p>
     Tossing it onto the cushions, Agatha realized she hadn’t gone to sleep with a blanket on. She didn’t know where it had come from.
    </p>
<p>
     Making her way into the kitchen, Agatha snuck up on Rio and hugged her from behind. Rio let out a surprised squeak before turning around with a smile on her face. Agatha let her out of the embrace only to grab her hand and kiss the back of it, bowing theatrically.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good morning to you too.” Rio glanced around the kitchen and realized they were alone. “No one else is up yet. You don’t have to do that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged. “Have to annoy you somehow.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re a tease.” Rio swatted the spatula at Agatha and went back to cooking. “So what’s the plan for today?” she asked over her shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think Alice and Lilia got tickets to see this local play or something. I don’t know what Jen is doing or what we’re doing.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I saw online that the vendor stalls from the tree lighting are still up for another day. We could go check that out today,” Rio offered.
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t know if Jen would be up for more shopping.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio transferred the eggs from pan to plate, waiting a beat before speaking. “We could go. Just the two of us.”
    </p>
<p>
     Her voice seemed almost timid, a tone that puzzled Agatha for a moment.
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh, yeah, sure. If you want to. I’m cool with that,” she nodded.
    </p>
<p>
     “Great.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio brought over two plates, setting one in front of each of them, and sat down. They ate without talking for a few minutes until Lilia and Alice came in.
    </p>
<p>
     “There’s our two favorite lovebirds,” Lilia exclaimed, giving each of them a side hug. “You two were out late last night. Did you have fun?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha met Rio’s eyes for a brief moment before she quickly looked away. “Yeah, we did,” she answered honestly.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks again for getting us that reservation, Lilia,” Rio added.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t mention it. Now,” she propped both elbows on the table and leaned in, “tell me everything.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio suddenly blushed, so Agatha took the lead.
    </p>
<p>
     “You can send us on a date, but that doesn’t mean we have to tell you what happened on it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia rubbed her chin, thinking. “No, I’m pretty sure that’s exactly what that means.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Just give us one little detail,” Alice said. “There has to be something you can spill.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sifted through her memories of last night, trying to find something that struck a balance between the truth and what they wanted to hear. After a few seconds, she found something.
    </p>
<p>
     “We were at the restaurant so long that the waiter had to tell us they were closing.”
    </p>
<p>
     “They kicked you guys out?” Alice laughed. “God, what were you talking about for four hours?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Probably planning out their wedding and the rest of their lives together,” Lilia said in a sappy voice. “I think a fall wedding would be lovely for you. It’s the perfect season for dark colors. Rio, you’d look gorgeous in a dark green.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s eyes widened, her face blanching, and Agatha sent her a sideways glance. Beneath the table, she moved her hand onto Rio’s knee, giving a gentle squeeze, knowing that helped her last time she got nervous.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed awkwardly. “I think you might be getting ahead of yourself, Lilia.”
    </p>
<p>
     Luckily, Alice picked up the conversation from there, moving to talk about the play, and Lilia was distracted from tormenting Agatha and Rio, at least for now.
    </p>
<p>
     Under the table, Agatha kept her hand on Rio’s knee until she felt her relax. Once she seemed at ease, Agatha started to retract her hand, but Rio stopped her, extending her pinky and catching it on the edge of Agatha’s hand. Agatha paused; a slight, tingling warmth radiating from where Rio made contact. Carefully, Agatha eased her hand back, closer to Rio again, and had to suppress the surprised expression on her face when Rio interlaced their fingers. There wasn’t a trace of hesitation.
    </p>
<p>
     The rest of breakfast went by in a blur, Agatha too distracted to participate any more than a nod here or there.
    </p>
<p>
     For the most part, this wasn’t a problem, but there were a few instances when Alice or Lilia would address Agatha directly and her mind would be too far away to realize it. Rio would then lightly kick her under the table or elbow her side, and Agatha would choke out an answer.
    </p>
<p>
     After they finished eating, Lilia and Alice got ready for their play while Agatha and Rio did the same for their shopping trip.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen put up a mild fight that she was being left behind but was placated with the reminder that she could relax by herself all day, no interruptions.
    </p>
<p>
     — — —
    </p>
<p>
     Finding a parking spot near the Christmas village proved to be an incredibly difficult task. Agatha circled the block three times before she found the narrowest spot in town. She put the car in park and looked out the window towards the commotion of people, her hands tightening around the wheel. This was even busier than the tree lighting night, and Agatha still hated shopping.
    </p>
<p>
     “You sure you want to go into all that?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned. “Yep.” She put her hand on Agatha’s forearm and caught her eye. “It’ll be fun.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes and got out of the car, careful not to hit the minivan parked next to them. She might avoid crowded Christmas shopping at all costs, but she wasn’t going to be a downer on Rio’s fun. They walked towards the crowd, and with a deep breath, she entered the fray, Rio by her side.
    </p>
<p>
     Almost immediately, someone bumped into Agatha. She scowled after them but was caught off guard when she saw Rio smiling.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re cute when you’re annoyed.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I am neither of those things.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grabbed Agatha’s wrist and excitedly pulled her deeper into the crowd. It felt like she was following around a kid in a toy store.
    </p>
<p>
     Moving from stall to stall, Rio did not let go of Agatha’s wrist, explaining that she didn’t want to lose her in the crowd, but when they paused in front of an advent calendar stall, Agatha wiggled her wrist free. Rio was momentarily taken aback until Agatha grabbed and held her hand.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re going to pull off my hand by the end of the day like that. This is much more comfortable.”
    </p>
<p>
     The sweet smile Rio gave in response sent a flutter of butterflies through Agatha’s stomach.
    </p>
<p>
     As they continued shopping, Agatha found herself enjoying the experience more and more. She never knew that it could be so much fun, but apparently she had just been missing the right partner all these years. Something about Rio’s excitement helped her get past her usual aversion to large crowds
    </p>
<p>
     Every few seconds, Rio paused to show Agatha something new she found and would talk to almost every single vendor in extensive detail about their product.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hadn’t known it was possible to have such a wide breadth of knowledge and was impressed by Rio’s scarily deep understanding of everything under the sun. Rio was able to hold a conversation with anyone about anything and easily keep up her end of it.
    </p>
<p>
     Waiting for her to finish a conversation about fountain pens, Agatha idly thought that it would be either really hard or really easy to buy a gift for someone like Rio. She would either be the kind of person who already has everything or would have so many different hobbies you could just pick one to buy something for. It was hard to tell which she was, but Agatha suddenly had the intention to figure it out once this trip was over.
    </p>
<p>
     In the meantime, Agatha was actually starting to participate in the shopping experience. Rio smiled when Agatha showed her things and unconsciously flexed her grip on Agatha’s hand.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had to admit that shopping was a lot more fun than she was expecting it to be, especially once she started to mirror Rio’s enthusiasm, each of them building off the other’s.
    </p>
<p>
     As they moved from stall to stall, Rio ended up buying a few knick knacks she liked, and Agatha, being the gentleman she was, offered to hold the bags. Rio tried to protest, but Agatha wouldn’t hear any of it, grabbing the brown paper bags before she had the chance.
    </p>
<p>
     The large crowd was still a sticking point for Agatha, though. She didn’t like being jostled around by stressed out shoppers, and holding Rio’s hand quickly became a grounding force in keeping her calm.
    </p>
<p>
     That was, until a rowdy little kid ran between their hands and severed their connection.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry!” the kid shouted as he disappeared into the crowd.
    </p>
<p>
     For a moment, Agatha couldn’t see Rio, and a flutter of worry overtook her. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, Rio appeared in front of Agatha, reassuring smile on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     “I got you,” she grinned, seizing Agatha’s hand.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took a step closer to Rio, not wanting her words to be lost in the noises of everyone around them. “Can we go into one of the actual stores? Should be less crowded in there,” she unconsciously ran her thumb over the back of Rio’s hand, “and I don’t want to lose you again.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tugged at the edge of Agatha’s beanie, pulling it over her eye. “Of course.”
    </p>
<p>
     They made their way towards the brick and mortar stores lining the street and entered one at random. A bell chimed as the door opened, and Agatha and Rio stepped into a small bookstore.
    </p>
<p>
     Unlike the bustling Christmas village, it had only a few people perusing the neatly organized shelves, a welcome change of pace for Agatha. She let out a sigh of relief as she took a step forward and began browsing the nearest shelf.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m gonna see if they have a bathroom,” Rio whispered.
    </p>
<p>
     She gave Agatha’s hand a squeeze before letting go. Agatha nodded goodbye and watched her walk away out of the corner of her eye. Once she couldn’t see Rio anymore, Agatha turned back to the shelf, a slight feeling of emptiness in her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pulled a random book off the shelf and flipped it over to read the back cover. It didn’t seem interesting, so she put it back. She took out another and did the same for a book with a dark mauve cover, but she paused right before she returned it. Agatha turned it over to see the front.
    </p>
<p>
     Persuasion by Jane Austen
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha vaguely remembered reading this book years ago. If she recalled correctly, it was about two people who used to date but broke up, only to get back together by the end. She was pretty sure the characters spent a lot of their time denying they had feelings for each other.
    </p>
<p>
     She had a sudden, inexplicable urge to buy it.
    </p>
<p>
     It would make a good gift for Rio, she reasoned. The least she could do was get her a little something as a thank you for coming on this trip.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hurried to the register to pay for it before Rio came back from the bathroom. She had just hidden it in the bag hanging from her arm when Rio reappeared.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wasted no time slipping her hand into Agatha’s when she resumed position by her side. Agatha raised an eyebrow, her heart hammering.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t want to lose you again,” Rio explained with a smile. “Your words, not mine.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha put up no complaint as they explored the rest of the bookstore hand in hand, and she spent most of that time simply watching Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     If Agatha were one to gamble, she would wager she had every single one of Rio’s subtle facial expressions memorized. There wasn’t a single arched eyebrow, twitch of the lip, or squinted eye that went unnoticed by Agatha. She knew every thought that went through Rio’s mind.
    </p>
<p>
     She was sure of it.
    </p>
<p>
     Once they got bored of the bookstore, they left and popped in and out of other stores along the strip, never letting each other out of their sight. They were in some artisan grocery shop when Agatha’s phone rang.
    </p>
<p>
     She slowed to a stop and tried to pull it out of her back pocket but quickly ran into a problem. One hand was holding the shopping bags, and the other was still occupied with Rio’s.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tried to wiggle her hand free from Rio, but she merely smirked, not letting go.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rushed to put the bags on the ground without breaking anything, and by the time she picked up the phone, it was one ring away from going to voicemail.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yello?” she answered just in time.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, you guys are still out shopping, right?” Jen asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mhm.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Could you pick up a couple things?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, wha—”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stopped short when Rio poked her cheek. She tilted her head in confusion and resumed the conversation.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you nee—”
    </p>
<p>
     Another poke. Agatha sent Rio a dirty look and tried to refocus on the conversation.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry about that, what did y—” Agatha yanked the phone from her ear. “Vidal! Would you stop that!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio giggled and poked her face again.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you need?” Agatha said quickly before she could be interrupted again.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen started to rattle off random food items, but Agatha couldn’t focus as Rio increased the frequency of her attacks. Every other word Jen said was never received as Agatha continued to glare at Rio who poked her face for the conversation’s duration.
    </p>
<p>
     “You got all that?” Jen asked, and Agatha hummed in acknowledgement. “Great, thanks.”
    </p>
<p>
     “So… what did Jen want?” Rio asked innocently after Agatha hung up.
    </p>
<p>
     “You are such a brat.” Agatha narrowed her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pressed a hand to her chest. “What ever are you talking about?”
    </p>
<p>
     “This. This. This. And this.” Agatha punctuated each word by poking Rio’s cheeks, but Rio only giggled more with each one. She added, “But I really don’t know. Groceries or something, I think.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha and Rio wandered around the grocery store, picking out random items they thought Jen might have called for. When they neared the registers, Rio spotted a display of gingerbread houses and pointed at them.
    </p>
<p>
     “We should get a couple of these. I was always the best at building them when I was a kid.”
    </p>
<p>
     “The best? Really? Seems a little cocky, don’t you think, Vidal?”
    </p>
<p>
     “A little cocky maybe, but true nonetheless.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’d say I could give you a run for your money.” Agatha raised her eyebrows and leaned in with a mischievous look in her eye. “Care to make a bet?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smirked. “What did you have in mind?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Standard gingerbread rules,” Agatha said as if this were a common phrase. “We each build one and compare after.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And what do I get when I win?”
    </p>
<p>
     “When you win, that’s funny.” Agatha let out a haughty chuckle. “Okay, we’ll go with that. What do you want?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Bragging rights.” She pretended to think for a few seconds before adding, “And… at the end of this vacation, I get to tell your friends about this little con you’re running,” she said, a risqué drawl in her voice. Rio’s request caught Agatha off guard, and she took the stunned silence as an opportunity. “Unless you’re too scared.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tilted her head so she was looking up at Agatha and pouted her lips. It drove Agatha crazy.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grit her teeth and tried to keep her composure. “And what do I get if I win?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Bragging rights, of course, but also,” Rio bit her lip, “You may call upon my fake girlfriend services again in the future. In case you ever need to lie to your friends again.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sucked in a breath. “That’s a compelling offer.” She thought it over for no more than two seconds before saying, “You’ve got yourself a deal.”
    </p>
<p>
     She stopped holding Rio’s hand for a moment so they could seal the deal with a handshake. Right after, they went back to holding hands and grabbed two gingerbread house boxes. Agatha pointed the corner of her box in Rio’s face.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re going down, Vidal.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Only on you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s jaw dropped, not expecting the comeback. She returned to her senses an instant later and yanked Rio into the checkout line.
    </p>
<p>
     “You are so dead,” she whisper shouted.
    </p>
<p>
     They exited the grocery store with more bags in tow, and this time, Rio refused to let Agatha hold all of them, so they were divided evenly between them.
    </p>
<p>
     They walked along the sidewalk for a while with no particular destination in mind with fewer pit stops at stores since they didn’t want to hold more bags. They were relegated to window shopping and let their walk take them further away from the bustling town center.
    </p>
<p>
     As they rounded the corner, Rio stopped short and backtracked several paces until they were hidden behind the building again. Agatha was pulled along with Rio’s haste and gave her a confused look when they stopped.
    </p>
<p>
     “What was that? What are we hiding from?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio peeked past the corner. “That was my ex girlfriend.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh.” A large smile spread across Agatha’s face. “Do you know what I’m thinking?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared at her, blinking. “I do not. I gave you almost no information. Why do I feel like this is about to spiral out of control?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It won’t. Trust me.” Agatha spoke quickly now, her excitement mounting. “I’m thinking that we make her a little jealous.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What? Why? How would we even do that?” Rio’s eyes were wide with apprehension.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll take those one at a time,” Agatha laughed. “What: We make your ex girlfriend jealous of me. Why: I think it could be funny. Or at least entertaining for a minute or two. How: We casually run into her and then crank up the PDA to eleven.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shifted from one foot to the other. “I don’t know…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took both Rio’s hands in her own and stared into her eyes, not blinking once. “Anyone who breaks up with the lovely, amazing, charming Rio Vidal is a crazy person in my book. They all could stand to feel a little jealous about her snazzy new partner.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We aren’t actually dating, though.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I don’t see how this is relevant.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, I mean—”
    </p>
<p>
     “We’ve gotten so good at pretending to date. I don’t see why you shouldn’t be allowed to reap the rewards as well.” Agatha did a little shrug and smiled. “I get to lie to my friends, you get to lie to yours. Well, your ex, but hey, details schmetails. Come on, it’ll be fun.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Mmm…” Rio rolled her neck, holding the sound. Agatha thought she sounded like a microwave. “Okay. We’ll do it, but just don’t go overboard.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha broke into a grin and latched onto Rio’s arm. She led them back around the corner, every step brimming with gusto, and confidently walked directly into Rio’s ex.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oof,” she grumbled, stumbling backwards. “I’m so sorry about that, ma’am.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s okay- wait, Rio, is that you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio put on a convincing fake smile. “Emily, hey! How have you been? Sorry about that. That clumsy person would be my girlfriend, Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stood behind Rio and leaned on her shoulders, offering Emily a small wave.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey,” she said, awkwardly returning the wave.
    </p>
<p>
     Emily seemed taken aback by the woman resting so casually on Rio, and Agatha smiled, ready to take it up a notch. After all, what are platonic friends for if not making their exes jealous through over the top romantic gestures?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha slipped a few fingers beneath Rio’s shirt collar and tilted her head to talk to her. “Babe, is this your one ex who did the horseback riding stuff?”
    </p>
<p>
     If Rio was bothered by Agatha playing with the strap of her sports bra, she didn’t say anything.
    </p>
<p>
     She shook her head. “No, that was Sasha.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had no idea if Sasha even existed but nodded along like this was a nice refresher for her memory. “Right, right. My bad. You know, speaking of Sasha, did we ever get her that invite for the bridal shower?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Bridal shower?” Emily asked, eyes widened in surprise. “You two are engaged?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio coughed and Agatha grinned ecstatically.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yep!”
    </p>
<p>
     Emily’s brow furrowed, suddenly confused. “Wait, I thought Rio said you were her girlfriend.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha waved off the comment.
    </p>
<p>
     “She always forgets to say fiancée instead of girlfriend. By the time she gets it right, I’ll be her wife. You know, I’d show you the ring, but I had to take it off with these gloves,” Agatha said, flopping her hand around uselessly. “Gosh, I just hate the winter. The cold and the snow and taking off my ring because of these dumb gloves. I’m so glad we picked a fall wedding.” She planted a kiss on Rio’s cheek. “You always look so beautiful in the fall.” She kissed Rio again near the corner of her mouth. “Who am I kidding? You look beautiful in all the seasons.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave a light laugh, flustered but hiding it, and sent an apologetic smile to Emily. “Sorry, she’s always like this. My affectionate little Aggie.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gently swatted at Rio. “I thought I told you not to call me Aggie in public?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know, but I can’t help it, my love. You’re always going to be my Aggie,” Rio said. She kissed Agatha on the corner of her jaw and smiled in a way that made her laugh lines stand out.
    </p>
<p>
     Despite trying to stay focused on making what’s-her-face jealous, Agatha couldn’t help but admire how breathtakingly beautiful Rio looked when she smiled like that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe I’ll have to find something to help you remember,” she breathed in Rio’s ear, low and sultry, her teeth barely grazing it. Agatha breathed a quiet laugh when she felt Rio shiver and tightened her grip on her shirt.
    </p>
<p>
     Emily interrupted with an awkward laugh. She cleared her throat. “It was nice running into you, Rio, but I should get going. Don’t want to keep you two occupied.”
    </p>
<p>
     She sidestepped around Agatha and Rio, and Agatha waited until she could no longer hear her footsteps to let go of Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “That went so well!” Agatha smiled, proud of herself. She moved to stand in front of Rio and saw that she looked like a tomato. “Your face is so red right now.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Heh, yeah,” Rio said, her eyes unfocused and glassy. She started pacing back and forth, flapping her hands nervously.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha felt a coil of worry settle in her chest, and she put a gentle hand on Rio’s arm to stop her. Rio froze when Agatha made eye contact.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, what’s wrong?” she asked, her voice soft. “Did I do too much?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio absentmindedly shook her head no and tried to start pacing again.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha glanced around.“Why don’t we go somewhere where there’s less people? That might help you relax.” She pulled out Google Maps on her phone and began thinking out loud. “I think I saw a sign for a park nearby… Plaza Park… quarter mile away… this way…”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha reoriented herself to face the park’s direction and flexed her hand, adjusting her grip on the shopping bags. She let out a breath, glancing back at Rio, and immediately felt a spike of guilt go through her.
    </p>
<p>
     She hadn’t thought Rio seeing her ex would have flustered her this much. Normally, Rio was more confident than Agatha was. It was a quality about her that Agatha really admired. If she had known this reaction would happen, Agatha wouldn’t have made Rio talk to Emily, and now she felt horrible.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, Vidal, look at me.” Rio managed to meet Agatha’s gaze. “We’re gonna walk to Plaza Park, okay? It has less people, so you can just sit and relax. No Emily there to worry about.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grabbed Rio’s hand, interlacing their fingers, and they made their way to the park. It was a straight shot down the street they were already on, and the easy navigation let Agatha keep an eye on Rio. She was still in a daze when they got there but slowly seemed to be coming out of it. Whenever Rio sent her a glance, Agatha squeezed her hand reassuringly.
    </p>
<p>
     Once in the park, they found a bench, and Agatha instructed Rio to sit down until she felt better. She sat beside her, keeping a careful watch over her but never letting her hand go. Agatha periodically cracked jokes to help Rio relax, feeling relieved with each subtle smile she coaxed out.
    </p>
<p>
     A few minutes passed like this, and Rio slouched back on the bench, letting out a sigh. She draped an arm over her face. “I was not expecting to get so flustered around her,” Rio said.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha noticed a hint of untruthfulness hidden in her words, something unsaid, but she ignored it, chalking it up to Rio’s prior nervousness. Now that she was back to her usual self, though, Agatha ventured a bolder joke.
    </p>
<p>
     “I guess you aren’t the top you thought you were.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s jaw dropped. “I—”
    </p>
<p>
     “You were very, very flustered.” Agatha poked at Rio’s ribs. “Around your ex girlfriend of all people.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That- I wasn’t-” Rio stuttered in protest before closing her mouth. “Nevermind.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And I come out on top once again,” Agatha said triumphantly, leaning back with her hands behind her head.
    </p>
<p>
     “You know what? No.” Rio sat up straighter. “I challenge you to a contest to determine which one of us comes out on top. Literally.”
    </p>
<p>
     “This is the world’s strangest foreplay—”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio rolled her eyes. “Not like that. Get your mind out of the gutter.” She gestured to a wide, frozen puddle in front of a storm drain. “Everyone knows that athletic prowess equates to sexual forte, so I challenge you to a speed skating competition.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha burst out laughing, hiding her face in her hands. “What!?” she exclaimed between gasps for breath.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio rubbed the back of her head sheepishly. “I don’t know, just go with it. I’m spitballing or something.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Or something is right,” Agatha said. She stood. “But I accept your challenge.”
    </p>
<p>
     She grabbed both Rio’s hands and pulled her to standing. Once they were both up, Agatha took off, racing Rio to their ‘skating rink’.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio chased after her, but Agatha still got there first. She gingerly placed her foot on the ice, testing it out, and stepped on once she determined it was thick enough.
    </p>
<p>
     She tried to spin back around to taunt Rio but nearly face planted. Rio snorted.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t laugh at me! I was coming back to help you,” Agatha grinned. She held out her hand, and Rio carefully took it, allowing Agatha to ease her onto the ice.
    </p>
<p>
     They didn’t have actual skates, but the ice was slippery enough that their regular shoes slid around. Agatha and Rio didn’t start their race right away, getting distracted with doing ballerina twirls on the ice, until Rio brought them back to the task at hand.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are we gonna race or not?” She put her hands on her hips.
    </p>
<p>
     “You wanna get it over with so you can lose quicker?” Agatha taunted.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ha ha. So, what is this race? Just once around, whoever is faster wins?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sounds good to me. Where’s our finish line?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio slid to the edge and picked up a twig sticking out of the snow, placing it on the ice in front of where they stood. “How's this?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. “Looks good to me.” They lined up behind the stick, and she gave Rio one last look. “Ready to lose?”
    </p>
<p>
     “In your dreams.”
    </p>
<p>
     Together, they counted down, “Three. Two. One. Go!”
    </p>
<p>
     Almost immediately, the stick marking their finish line was kicked away as they scrambled to start. Agatha didn’t concern herself with that, though, propelling herself forward, neck and neck with Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Going around the corners was tight, and both of them were inches away from falling multiple times. When that happened, one would grab onto the other in a panic and pull themself back up. It threatened to knock both of them over, but they managed to stay upright the whole time.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha briefly wondered why they chose such a small pond, but she didn’t have time for that. They were almost done with their one lap race. There was only one problem.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait, where’d the stick go?” Agatha blurted out.
    </p>
<p>
     All Rio could say was, “Huh?” before she crashed into a snowbank. Agatha, unfortunately, wasn’t far behind and tackled her further into the snow. They landed in a twisted pile of limbs and laughter, and Agatha was quick to get off of Rio, her elbow having landed in Rio’s ribs.
    </p>
<p>
     She took a few seconds to catch her breath only to burst out laughing again when she tried to look at Rio. She returned her gaze to the sky and tried to peek at Rio a few seconds later, only for another fit of giggles to erupt. This cycle repeated several more times until they could get it together enough to form a sentence.
    </p>
<p>
     “I, I totally won,” Rio said between breaths.
    </p>
<p>
     “No way you did. I got in front of you at the last second.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio playfully pushed her arm and tossed her head back, looking at the sky “I barely even remember what the whole purpose of that was. I just can’t believe we both fell into the snow.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Allow me to remind you,” Agatha smirked. She rolled off her back and moved to bracket Rio’s hips with her knees. Agatha leaned close to Rio’s face and studied her features intently for a second before her mouth curved into a suggestive smile. She curled her finger beneath Rio’s chin and compelled their eyes to meet. “Ring any bells?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s breath hitched.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a beat of silence, uncertainty, when their eyes locked.
    </p>
<p>
     Only the two of them existed.
    </p>
<p>
     And, for the briefest moment, Agatha thought of kissing Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     She chased away the thought in a panic before it could take root.
    </p>
<p>
     A good choice, too, because the next thing Agatha knew, Rio was tossing her into the snow again. Agatha’s back hit the snow with a soft thud, and she heard Rio cackling at her own antics.
    </p>
<p>
     “Harkness!” Rio barked, her smile evident in her words. She covered her face in embarrassment, laughing all the while, and repeated, “Harkness!”
    </p>
<p>
     Something was hidden beneath Rio’s laughter, though, but Agatha couldn’t place it. It was on the tip of her tongue, but she couldn't grasp the unsaid words. Agatha closed her eyes, laying solemnly in the snow, as one and only thought consumed her mind: she wished she had kissed Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha heard shuffling beside her and glanced over to find that Rio had stood. She offered Agatha a hand, helping her up.
    </p>
<p>
     Back on her feet, Agatha brushed away the snow stuck on her clothes. It was a mindless, simple task to keep her hands busy as her mind grappled with whatever the fuck just happened. By the time she got all the snow off, Agatha had neatly packaged away her thoughts in an obscure corner of her mind, hopefully never to be thought of again. She didn’t know what it was, but she knew couldn’t deal with it right now.
    </p>
<p>
     “Should we head back to the cabin now?” Rio asked, snapping Agatha back to attention. “Our clothes are soaked from falling in the snow, and I don’t want to stay in them longer than I have to.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That sounds like a good idea,” Agatha replied, her voice unexpectedly hoarse.

<p>
     Pulling into the driveway, Agatha’s clothes were still wet from the snow and they clung to her body. The cold fabric only compounded her sense of unease, but by the time they got home, she had pulled herself together enough.
    </p>
<p>
     She and Rio hurried from the car to the door, not wanting to stay in the snow any longer, and when Jen saw them come in, she got up to help them unpack.
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice, can you pause that real quick?” Jen called as she came in the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     The movie playing on the TV froze mid frame as Alice obliged, Lilia grumbling that her movie had stopped.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks.” Jen turned to Agatha and Rio as she started to unload the bags. “Did you get everything I told you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha bit her lip. “Depends. What did you ask for?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Bread, chicken, pasta, and eggs.”
    </p>
<p>
     As Jen counted off each item, Agatha subtly moved the bag containing Rio’s gift under the table. She didn’t need the surprise being spoiled just yet. She looked back at Jen.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, we did not get any of that,” Agatha replied bluntly. She reached her hand in a bag, and a wide smile crept on her face. “But, we did get gingerbread houses.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen stared at her, annoyed. “Agatha. We can’t eat that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged. “You technically could.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Great, now there’s two of you,” Jen exhaled sharply, her irritation growing. “Could your girlfriend please be less stubborn than you?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took a protective step in front of Rio. “Hey, don’t talk about her like that. She’s perfect just the way she is.” She felt Rio’s hand ghost over her elbow.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen rolled her eyes. “Fine, whatever, but do you at least have a reason for not getting what I asked?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha glanced back at Rio, vividly remembering being poked in the face. Even just the thought of it, and her face seemed to get warmer. It was like her skin remembered exactly where Rio had touched her, a magnet pulling them together again. Rio gave her a soft smile.
    </p>
<p>
     Wait, what had she been thinking about?
    </p>
<p>
     Jen waved her hand obnoxiously in front of Agatha’s face. “Hello? Earth to Agatha. Why don’t we have food right now?”
    </p>
<p>
     Right. Jen was mad at her. Now she remembered.
    </p>
<p>
     Not wanting Jen to blame Rio, she said, “That’s on me. I wasn’t really listening when you called. Because your voice is so harsh and grating. It pains my ears.” Agatha smirked, starting to have fun with it. “Not to mention that tinny sound when you talk on the phone. Gosh, it just goes from bad to worse. You know, I’m really the victim here.”
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha heard a muffled laugh coming from Rio, a slight smile crept onto her face. That didn’t last very long, though, as Jen scolded her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, that is not a reason. You just ignored my call. I can’t believe you.” She tossed the gingerbread houses onto the kitchen table and one fell off. “You can finish putting this stuff away by yourself. I’m going back to the movie.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen stormed into the living room in a huff, and a few seconds later, the movie resumed. Agatha and Rio exchanged a silent glance, their expressions mirroring the wide eyed guilt of kids caught red handed by a principal, but in the instant their eyes met, the tension was gone and a sense of like minded camaraderie flowed between them.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why don’t you go change?” Agatha offered. “I can finish this.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you sure?” Rio asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “No sense in both of us staying in wet clothes. I’ll be there in a minute or two.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded, a grateful smile on her lips, and Agatha turned back to the bags. She quickly organized what they bought, and when she finished, she crept over to the living room, Rio’s gift in hand.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned over the edge of the couch, but before she could say anything, Jen tried to wave her off.
    </p>
<p>
     “Would you just go?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Cool it, Kale. I’m here for Lilia.”
    </p>
<p>
     Hearing her name, Lilia’s ears perked up. “Yes, I will be your maid of honor.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I- No,” Agatha shook her head. “I just want to know if I can hide Rio’s gift in your room. I got it for her today, and I—”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia held up a hand. “Say no more. Of course you can.” She gave her a wide smile and pointed towards the bedroom. “Now go.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha thanked her and hurriedly tossed it onto Lilia’s bed. She had spent far too long in cold, wet clothes and needed to change out of them before she went crazy. She opened her bedroom door only to stop dead in her tracks.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s back was turned to her, and Agatha’s brain seemingly short circuited, struggling to take in the sight of Rio standing in pajama pants and a sports bra.
    </p>
<p>
     Her eyes widened and she froze, forgetting how to breathe. For several seconds, she couldn’t move. She just stared at the strong lines of Rio’s back and the curve of her shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
     Somehow, even in something as mundane as pulling off her shirt, Rio’s movements were fluid and precise. Muscles flexed under her smooth skin, every motion deliberate, every line defined. Agatha couldn’t tear her eyes away. The only thing she managed was mentally checking off her earlier suspicions from when Rio chopped wood.
    </p>
<p>
     Her thoughts strayed further, and she idly wondered what Rio might look like without any fabric in the way.
    </p>
<p>
     Heat surged to Agatha’s face, and just as quickly as it appeared, she desperately yanked her brain away from that thought, begging to focus on literally anything else.
    </p>
<p>
     Unfortunately, Rio did not hear Agatha’s silent prayers.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha just about died when Rio’s hands moved to the strap of her sports bra.
    </p>
<p>
     Suddenly, she was staring at Rio’s bare back, her mind utterly blank.
    </p>
<p>
     She should leave. She should say something. She should do something. Any of the above, all of the above, Agatha didn’t care, but instead, she stood frozen in place, quickly devolving into an incoherent mess.
    </p>
<p>
     Meanwhile, Rio, unaware of her audience of one, reached for the oversized sweater in front of her. She slipped it over her head in one smooth motion, and the fabric fell into place, covering everything. Rio’s hands moved to smooth the hem as she turned around.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha broke from the trance just in time. Though she was positive her face was still white as a sheet.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, hey,” Rio smiled, walking across the room. “Did you get everything put away?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha eked out a noise that was interpreted as a yes, and Rio chuckled at her awkwardness.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, I’ll meet you out there.”
    </p>
<p>
     She stepped around Agatha, who had yet to move from the doorway, and as she disappeared down the hallway, she called back, “Get ready to lose, Harkness.”
    </p>
<p>
     Try as she might, Agatha had zero recollection of the minutes that followed as she changed her clothes, and the next thing she knew, she was standing in the kitchen in her pajamas.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio heard her come in and started talking without looking up. “So I opened up the boxes, but one of the walls kind of broke in half when Jen threw it. I figured that—” She glanced up and stopped short. “Hey, what’s wrong? You look like you saw a ghost or something.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hmm? No, I’m fine,” Agatha said dismissively.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stood halfway, her chair scraping lightly against the floor. “Are you sure?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded but didn’t say anything.
    </p>
<p>
     Concern etched Rio’s brow and she quietly got up, guiding Agatha to a chair. She sat cross legged beside her and took Agatha’s trembling hand in her own, her touch featherlight as she traced faint circles in Agatha’s palm.
    </p>
<p>
     “Talk to me,” Rio said, her voice soft and steady. “What’s wrong?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head. “I can’t. I- I don’t know.” She closed her eyes. “I don’t know what’s wrong. There was the thing and the something and the—”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s okay. Let’s just start with this: how do you feel right now?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I- Like I can’t- I can’t…” Her words fragmented as she gestured vaguely toward her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     “Catch your breath?” Rio offered and Agatha nodded. “Alright. We can work on that together. Look at me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shakily lifted her eyes and found Rio’s gaze to be steady, reassuring.
    </p>
<p>
     “Breathe with me,” Rio said gently. She inhaled deeply and held it for a moment before exhaling slowly.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha managed a nod and tried to follow along. Her first breath hitched, shallow and uneven, but Rio’s faint touch on her arm steadied her. The soft, rhythmic trail of her fingers brushing up and down her forearm with each breath anchored her, pulling Agatha out of the swirling panic.
    </p>
<p>
     The steady cadence of inhale and exhale stretched on, Agatha losing count as her chest loosened with each breath. The tension in her shoulders slowly faded, and a quiet sigh of relief escaped from Agatha’s lips.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you,” she whispered.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled, lingering for a moment before standing. She leaned down and planted a light kiss on top of Agatha’s head, a seemingly instinctive and familiar gesture. “Anything for you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio returned to her original seat, sitting across from Agatha, and resumed talking about the gingerbread houses. She easily slipped back into the conversation, and Agatha was grateful they didn’t dwell on her breakdown.
    </p>
<p>
     “When Jen threw the boxes onto the table, one of them fell onto the chair,” Rio said, pointing at the gingerbread houses as she explained. “It only broke one wall, which isn’t too bad, but that still leaves us with a broken wall. Not sure what we want to do with that in terms of our bet.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll build that one,” Agatha said abruptly, already reaching for the broken piece.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you sure?
    </p>
<p>
     “I can icing it back together. Besides, it’ll be like a handicap to level the playing field since my gingerbread house building skills are so superior to yours.”
    </p>
<p>
     It was her classic strategy: act overly confident when you do things for reasons you don’t understand.
    </p>
<p>
     Did Agatha know why she was willingly giving Rio an advantage? No. But was she about to try to figure that out when she had a competition to focus on? Also no.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio picked up on Agatha’s newfound competitive spirit and matched it. “That so? Alright, Harkness, let’s see what you can do with a broken wall then.”
    </p>
<p>
     With that, the contest commenced.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had an early lead in constructing her house while Agatha glued her wall back together with icing. The kits they bought came with cardboard supports to hold up the walls and roof while waiting for the icing to harden, so they didn’t have any collapses.
    </p>
<p>
     In the middle of putting her roof in place, Agatha happened to glance up at Rio and saw her intently focused on her work. Her brow furrowed, and her tongue pressed against the inside of her cheek. The corner of Agatha’s mouth twitched up, amused by the sight, before she put her head down and got back to work.
    </p>
<p>
     Eventually, they had the structures built and moved onto decorating. Agatha stole and ate more pieces of stale candy than she was willing to admit but still managed to have enough left over to decorate her house. She went with a classic Christmas theme and started by alternating green and red gumdrops on the peak of the roof.
    </p>
<p>
     She was putting the finishing details on the windows when Rio dramatically pulled her hands away from her house.
    </p>
<p>
     “Done!” she announced, leaning back in her chair with a proud smile on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha clamped down on the icing tube, trying to squeeze out the last drops. “Almost… done… There! Perfect.” She sat back to admire her work. “That’s not half bad.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Already demoting yourself from perfect to not half bad, Harkness?” Rio shook her head with mock pity. “And I thought you were confident.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Shut it, Vidal. Let’s get these houses judged.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stood and made her way to the living room. She motioned for Alice to pause the movie before explaining they needed the three of them to judge their houses and vote on a winner.
    </p>
<p>
     “And what are the stakes of this bet again?” Alice asked as they made their way to the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can’t tell you that,” Rio replied. She glanced at Agatha and winked. “Although, depending on the outcome you might find that out later.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha arranged the two houses in front of Jen, Alice, and Lilia for them to judge. She and Rio took a step back and silently watched as they whispered back and forth.
    </p>
<p>
     As they waited, Rio leaned closer to Agatha, and in a whisper the others couldn’t hear, she said, “No matter the outcome, I had a lot of fun today. It was great hanging out with you, so thank you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Something about Rio’s genuine tone made Agatha dial back the competitiveness. “Of course. I had fun with you, too. You’re great to be around. I mean it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia stood abruptly, and her chair made a grating sound against the floor. Everyone cringed away from the noise, but she pressed on.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’ve made a decision,” she announced, “and we will reveal our votes one at a time. I shall go first. Drumroll please.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha waited for her to say a name but realized Lilia was being serious. She found a random nearby surface and started tapping it. Rio copied her.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia stalled for another second, allowing the drumroll to build, before she said, “Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Ha!” Agatha cheered, sticking her finger in Rio’s face. “That’s one vote for me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Pipe down. You still need another.” Rio rolled her eyes and pushed away Agatha’s hand, turning her attention back to Alice and Jen.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, so, I’m not gonna be as dramatic as Lilia was,” Alice said. “My vote is Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Ooh, a tie…” Rio widened her eyes and spoke animatedly into an invisible microphone. “What will happen next? Will the plucky upstart Agatha Harkness be able to snatch another vote? Or will the crown go to the returning champion— adored by millions— the one, the only, Rio Vidal?” Rio dropped her voice an octave. “The final vote comes down to Jen Kale. Let’s see what she has to say.”
    </p>
<p>
     All eyes turned to Jen, and Agatha suddenly had to confront the possibility that she might not win. Her heart thrummed in her chest as her reputation sat on the line.
    </p>
<p>
     “Despite the fact I’m still a little annoyed with Agatha, this was actually hard to pick. You are both bizarrely good at this. Agatha, I don’t know where you found her, but you two definitely match each other’s freak, so good job, I guess?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Jen, you’re rambling,” Lilia whispered.
    </p>
<p>
     “But Agatha, your house is leaning a little to the left. I think it’s because your wall is glued back together— sorry about that, by the way— but for that reason, my vote goes to Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes!” Rio pumped her fist in the air.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?! That’s so unfair,” Agatha protested over Rio’s cheers. “That wall wasn’t even my fault.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pinched Agatha’s lips shut. “A bet’s a bet, and you volunteered to use the broken wall.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha cursed herself internally for that stupid, selfless act. Why had she even tried to help Rio in the first place? It very clearly backfired in her face.
    </p>
<p>
     “‘et go a i ‘ips,” Agatha muttered.
    </p>
<p>
     “Huh?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha squirmed out of Rio’s grip. “I said let go of my lips,” she repeated.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled sheepishly. “Oh. Sorry.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s fine,” Agatha said, rubbing her mouth. She sidestepped around Rio to grab a can of beer from the fridge. “Congratulations,” she said as she pulled the tab, resigning herself to her fate. She looked to Rio, searching her expression. “Just, when the time comes, go easy on me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave her a soft smile. “I wouldn’t have it any other way.”
    </p>
<p>
     In that one simple sentence, Agatha knew she believed Rio’s words. She wasn’t going to try to weasel her way out of the bet— Agatha was a woman of her word, after all— but she trusted Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     The realization settled gently in her chest, and Agatha didn’t quite know what to do with it.

<p>
     On the precipice between asleep and awake, Agatha turned over in bed. She fluffed her pillow and tried to get comfortable for the millionth time, the sun shining annoyingly in her eyes. After everything that had happened yesterday, she just wanted a few more minutes under the covers, but the universe wasn’t willing to cooperate.
    </p>
<p>
     Grumbling, Agatha glanced idly at the clock and saw it was well into mid morning, almost 10:30. It wasn’t surprising, given the sun’s brightness, but she didn’t think she had slept that long.
    </p>
<p>
     In a last ditch effort to go back to sleep, Agatha tossed in bed again, her arm unconsciously reaching for Rio’s side of the bed, only to fall flat on the mattress.
    </p>
<p>
     Right. She had left bed half an hour ago. Or was it an hour? Agatha couldn’t remember. Time had lost all meaning when she was with Rio or thinking about Rio or really anything to do with Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Meandering out of bed, Agatha ran her hand over her face to wipe away the sleepiness, aimlessly tousling her hair as she slipped on her robe. She tied the sash tight around her waist.
    </p>
<p>
     Walking into the kitchen, Agatha scanned the room and saw Rio wasn’t there. She shoved her hands in her pockets, trying not to look furtively at the floor.
    </p>
<p>
     “Where’s Vidal?” she said.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen looked up from her phone from where she was sitting in the kitchen. “Can I ask you a question?” Agatha didn’t answer, but she continued on anyway. “Why do you call her Vidal? Why not Rio?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged. “I dunno, we worked together before we dated and everyone at the station calls each other by their last names. I guess it’s just more natural.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I used to work at the station, too, but you haven’t called me Wu in years,” Alice chimed in. “Why’d you switch over?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Jeez, what’s with the third degree?” Agatha put her hands up. “I just wanted to know where Vidal is.”
    </p>
<p>
     Leave it to Jen and Alice to get in her way when she’s trying to find her fake girlfriend.
    </p>
<p>
     “She’s on the porch,” Jen said, finally answering the question and pointing to the door.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s eyebrows shot up. “Isn’t it, like, below freezing out right now?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Your guess is as good as mine,” she replied with a shrug, going back to her phone.
    </p>
<p>
     Grabbing a blanket off the couch, Agatha shook her head. “She’s crazy. Insane. What is she even doing out there?” she muttered. Hand resting on the doorknob, she braced herself for the onslaught of cold and bravely stepped onto the porch.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio startled at the sound of the door opening but smiled when she saw Agatha. She was sitting on the porch swing with her hands curled around a steaming cup of coffee, her cheeks bright pink from the cold.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, yourself,” Agatha said.
    </p>
<p>
     She stood awkward on the porch, hugging the blanket to her chest, before Rio shifted to the side so she could sit down. Agatha shook out the blanket and draped it over their laps. Rio seemed glad for the extra warmth, tucking the blanket under her leg on one side and pressing against Agatha on the other.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why are you sitting out in the cold?” Agatha asked once they had finished adjusting the blanket.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared into the middle distance for a moment, a serene look on her face, before responding. “I like watching the snow.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked at Rio like she was nuts. “It’s been snowing the entire trip.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure,” Rio said slowly, “but we’ve been running around, errands and stuff, the whole time. I haven’t gotten a chance to just watch it fall.” She leaned back, the swing rocking gently under her shifted weight, and sighed. “It’s peaceful.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha mimicked Rio and reclined on the swing. They both wordlessly picked up their feet and let it swing freely. Agatha watched the white specks fall from the sky, unexpectedly mesmerized by the sight. She tilted her head as if to get a better view.
    </p>
<p>
     “I guess I see your point,” she said softly.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha let her head fall to rest on Rio’s shoulder, letting out a relieved exhale, her breath visible against the cold. She allowed her muscles to slacken as she further relaxed onto Rio, and they watched the snow come down together, a still moment between them.
    </p>
<p>
     As she traced the paths of snowflakes falling, her eyes began to droop and she struggled to keep them open. Agatha yawned and heard Rio laugh quietly through her nose as she curled closer. She closed her eyes, telling herself it would only be for a second.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t know how much time had passed when the sound of the front door jolted her awake, but she kept her eyes shut, wanting a few more minutes to sleep on Rio’s shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, Rio, we’re going to go pick up a few things for dinner tonight,” Jen said.
    </p>
<p>
     “We should be back sometime after lunch,” Alice added. She noticed Agatha leaning on Rio and stepped to get a better look. “Is she asleep?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged the shoulder Agatha wasn’t on. “She’s tired.”
    </p>
<p>
     “From what?” Alice asked. “She slept later than all of us.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Probably still spent from when I fucked her brains out last night,” Rio said casually.
    </p>
<p>
     “WHAT?!” Agatha reeled back, mortified, as Rio failed to suppress her laughter.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ha! I knew you weren’t asleep,” she triumphed, a shit eating grin on her face. “That’s a play out of my own book. You can’t fool me with that one.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I wasn’t even doing anything!” Agatha protested, unbelieving that Rio would say such a thing. “That was just cruel.” She suddenly remembered that Jen, Alice, and Lilia were still beside them. “That didn’t happen by the way. We did not do anything last night.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Tell that to your hickeys,” Rio snickered.
    </p>
<p>
     “I- I don’t—”
    </p>
<p>
     “Goodbye, you two,” Lilia said in a singsong voice, cutting off Agatha. She, Jen, and Alice left them on the porch and made their way to the car.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha waited for the car to leave the driveway, and she turned to Rio, an unamused look on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     “Was that really necessary?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, but I had fun.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Mhm, well I’m going inside. I’m cold and hungry, two problems that can be solved in the kitchen.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shifted the whole of the blanket onto Rio’s lap and got up. She took half a step before Rio’s hand caught her wrist.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait, no, you're my space heater. Come back,” Rio pleaded, holding the blanket in her arms. “I’m cold by myself.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took the blanket from her and threw it around her shoulders. “You’re more than welcome to come in with me,” she said as she tied the blanket around Rio’s neck like a cape. She caught Rio’s eye and quickly averted her gaze. “But I will be inside for the foreseeable future.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha continued to the door and was happy to hear Rio’s footsteps trailing behind her as she stepped back into the warmth.
    </p>
<p>
     Inside, Rio took a seat at the table while Agatha went to grab the cereal box, bowls, and spoons. She brought them back to divvy up the last of the cereal, shaking out the crumbs from the bottom of the bag. Rio nodded a thank you.
    </p>
<p>
     “We really should have brought more milk,” Rio said, eyeing up the cereal on her spoon. “I don’t know how much more dry cereal I can take.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We check out tomorrow morning, so you won’t have to deal with it for too much longer.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, that’s right. I feel like this trip went so fast.” She looked down at the bowl, hiding her face from Agatha. “I don’t know if I wanna go home yet.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha poked Rio’s leg with her foot under the table. “Look on the bright side: you still get to hang out with me at work, and once we leave, you won’t have to see any of those hooligans.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked back up, eyebrows raised. “Thank goodness. You are my favorite part of this trip, after all,” she said sarcastically.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha noticed her eyes flick to the side for a moment, and it was in that slight twitch that made her question just how sarcastic Rio was being, but then Rio regained her composure as quickly as it left and grinned at Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “And, since tonight is our last night here, I think that means I get to tell your friends about our little bet.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes, easily pushing away her doubts about any hidden meaning in Rio’s expression. “You would be excited about that, wouldn’t you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “‘Course I would,” she said, waving around her spoon. “I’ve been looking forward to it for the past twelve hours. It’s my life long dream.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Alright, enough about embarrassing me. What was your favorite part of the trip?” Before Rio could say anything, she quickly added, “And don’t say winning the bet.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took a minute to think, swallowing a bite of food before answering. “Probably when you were groveling in front of me, trying to convince me to come with you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stared at her with a blank expression. “You do love to torment me, don’t you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “That's literally the whole reason I came,” Rio smiled sweetly. “What about you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I was gonna say shopping with you yesterday, but after hearing your answer, I’m changing mine to when I hit you in the face with a snowball.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha saw the faintest blush dusting Rio’s cheeks and smiled softly, thinking back to when she took care of her split lip, a warm feeling spreading from her chest at the idea. She shook herself out of the trance before her thoughts strayed too far in another direction.
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, new topic, one where we can’t take shots at each other.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned in and rested her chin in her hand, intrigued. “And what’s that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “A peacock is just a chicken in drag.” She made a wide, sweeping motion with her hands to open the floor for conversation. “Discuss.”
    </p>
<p>
     The look Rio gave her could only be described as utter confusion. Agatha watched the gears turning in her head, trying to wrap her mind around the nonsense Agatha just said. There were several seconds of bewildered silence before Rio responded.
    </p>
<p>
     “What?!!” She shook her head in disbelief. “No. Just no.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed. “Why not? Just think about it. You know what a chicken looks like, you know what a peacock looks like. Now tell me I’m wrong.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re wrong.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Whatever.” She waved Rio off. “Agree to disagree.”
    </p>
<p>
     From there, their conversation moved to more regular topics, mostly because Rio didn’t want to entertain Agatha’s absurdity about avian drag shows. When their bowls emptied, neither moved to get up and they continued talking, the morning hours bleeding into noon.
    </p>
<p>
     At some point, Rio finished her cup of coffee from the porch, and Agatha happily offered to set another pot to brew. She hit the start button and went to sit back down, easily picking up where they left off in the conversation, the smell of coffee slowly filling the room as they chatted.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hold that thought,” Rio said, cutting off Agatha’s story about the Salem Witch Trials. “It’s getting so hot in here. I can’t keep this on anymore.”
    </p>
<p>
     She stood and untied her blanket cape, haphazardly draping it over the side of the couch. Pointing at the fireplace, Rio said, “Alice did a pretty good job of the fire today. I guess she cut more logs at some point.”
    </p>
<p>
     With that comment, Agatha’s thoughts were thrown off balance, thinking of when she and Rio cut wood, and from there they went to seeing Rio’s exposed back when she had accidentally walked in on her.
    </p>
<p>
     A wave of guilt passed over her, and she knew she had to come clean.
    </p>
<p>
     “I have a confession,” Agatha said abruptly.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned around, her expression a blend of surprise and relief before resuming a stoic, unbothered poker face. In that fraction of a second, something in her shifted, unnoticed by Agatha, but suddenly, every move she made seemed both stiff and precise at once. Rio spoke slowly. “I have one too.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha waited until Rio was sitting again. She took a deep breath, fidgeting with her hands. “I saw you changing last night.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s small, hopeful smile fell. “Oh… okay.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I- I promise I didn’t see anything. It was an accident,” she scrambled to add. She held up three fingers. “Scouts honor. I just thought you should know because that’s the reason I had a panic attack last night, and I wanted to tell you so you wouldn’t worry, but also because I don’t want you to think I am hiding anything. I really didn’t mean to, and I didn’t see anything and—” Agatha realized she was rambling and rushed to stop talking. “I’m so sorry.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s gaze was a thousand miles away.
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t have to apologize. It was an accident. It’s fine.”
    </p>
<p>
     Her voice trailed off, and Agatha got the sneaking suspicion Rio wasn’t telling her something.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you oka—”
    </p>
<p>
     “I have to go to the bathroom,” Rio announced. She stood and her chair made an awful scraping noise against the floor.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio, wait!”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha caught her wrist as Rio tried to make a hasty exit. Rio spun around, a panicked look on her face. Her breath caught, and her eyes darted everywhere but Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s wrong? What were you going to say?” Agatha fought to steady her voice, smoothing out the raw edge of desperation that had crystallized in her chest when she saw Rio’s panic.
    </p>
<p>
     “Never mind, never mind,” Rio said, her sentences clipped. She shook her head, muttering something under her breath, and tugged at her wrist. The grip remained firm. “I’m fine. It doesn’t matter.”
    </p>
<p>
     The words rang hollow, like she was trying to convince herself more than anyone else. She tried to leave again, but Agatha stood, feeling the frantic racing of Rio’s pulse hammering beneath her fingers.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, it does matter,” she insisted.
    </p>
<p>
     “It doesn’t.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It does, and I know it does, otherwise you wouldn’t be so upset right now.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not upset,” Rio snapped, her voice flaring.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, you are!” Agatha could feel a lump rising in her throat, close to breaking. “Just tell me what’s wrong!”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio finally met her gaze, and Agatha could see tears threatening to break free. Her voice was strained, like a dam on the verge of collapsing, charged with pent up emotion.
    </p>
<p>
     “I fell for you, Agatha.
     <em>
      Hard
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s words struck the air like a match on dry kindling, and suddenly, the pieces were falling into place.
    </p>
<p>
     Every lingering touch, every stolen glance, every little thing that blurred the lines of their friendship surged from the shadows, hellbent on forcing Agatha into an epiphany.
    </p>
<p>
     Every time Rio handed her a steaming cup of coffee before she’d even asked, every time Agatha had grabbed Rio’s gloves without a second thought. Those moments in their game of pretend that went too far and the ones that went further still when no one was around.
    </p>
<p>
     Late night conversations that stretched into all hours of the night, spending every waking moment with each other, inside jokes that felt years in the making but were born in mere days.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s mind came to a stuttering halt as she relived every detail of their vacation, her memories reframed in inconceivable ways. Had this been happening the entire time? The question spiraled through her thoughts, plummeting, out of control. Was she really that oblivious? There was no way this was true. It just couldn’t be.
    </p>
<p>
     But there was that little voice in the back of her mind. It had been there this whole time, but she had packaged it away, ignoring it for days, hoping she wouldn’t have to answer to it, yet here she was. The voice had gone from a quiet nagging to blaring over the loudspeakers of her mind.
    </p>
<p>
     She couldn’t think her way out of it this time. There were no excuses or overthinking, no beating around the bush, no burying it under the crushing weight of denial. The truth was out— raw, irrefutable, and staring her right in the face. And it was not going back.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s heart stopped beating. The world stopped spinning. The very air she breathed ceased to exist.
    </p>
<p>
     She had fallen in love with Rio Vidal.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tried to leave the kitchen again, tugging at her wrist. At the idea of losing her, Agatha panicked and pulled Rio back. There was only an instant of hesitation, their eyes meeting for the briefest moment, Rio searching for meaning in her expression before Agatha launched herself at Rio and caught her in a passionate kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     Surprised, Rio froze for an instant as she realized what was happening. She kissed Agatha back, intense but tender, like she’d been waiting for this all along.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s hands slipped into Rio’s hair, fingers threading through it to draw her closer, and Rio cupped Agatha’s face like a lifeline. It was as if holding onto each other was the only thing keeping them from sinking into the floor, from being swallowed whole by the chaos of their unraveling hearts.
    </p>
<p>
     They broke apart for air for all but a heartbeat before Agatha surged forward again, their bodies flush against each other. Her heart swelled, a collision of swirling emotions, as her connection to Rio became her every thought. Every second folded into infinity as they melted into each other, the only beings in the universe.
    </p>
<p>
     Gently, Agatha pulled back, her forehead at rest against Rio’s. She cradled Rio’s face in her hands, the stillness stretching between them as neither dared to move, afraid of what might happen next.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s heart pounded as she listened to the faint sound of Rio’s breathing. She was vaguely aware of trying to catch her own breath but was far too occupied with the pure exhilaration finding its way to every corner of her body. The only thing she cared about right now was Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly, Agatha drew back, her gaze flicking up to look at Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Her breath caught as she saw how the soft glow of light caught the curve of Rio’s cheek, the sparkling of unfallen tears in her eyes. Agatha thought she might never see anything so beautiful again. She was exquisite, the thing of poetry and songs. Rio’s mere existence seemed to have changed her to her core.
    </p>
<p>
     How had she been so blind? For a whole week, this remarkable woman had stood by her side, and it took her a thousand years to open her eyes. But now that she had, Agatha could see it all.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blinked nervously as she looked up, scared to meet Agatha’s eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     A slight smile crept across Agatha’s face. “I may have another confession to make.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio ducked her head to hide her face, pressing her forehead to Agatha’s sternum. Agatha let out a soft chuckle when she saw Rio’s body shaking with relieved laughter.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, why are you hiding?” Agatha smiled coyly, brushing back a piece of Rio’s hair. She bent so she could see eye to eye with Rio, gently coaxing her to look up again. “I’ve got a question for you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio ghosted her fingers along Agatha’s arm, her featherlight touch sending out a ripple of goosebumps. She glanced to the side, shifting her weight back and forth. Her gaze was reserved yet hopeful when she lifted it to meet Agatha’s, and her voice was fragile as she asked, “What’s that?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled with quiet affection, taking her time with her words. “Would you like to be my one hundred percent real girlfriend? No faking it, playing pretend, or acting for others. No cons, ruses, or scams. Just me and you.” She took a breath. “Would you, Rio Vidal, like to be my girlfriend?”
    </p>
<p>
     A beat passed between them, and Rio threw her arms around Agatha’s neck. Her laughter spilled into the kiss, the sound of happiness overflowing. When she finally pulled back, her grin was uncontainable.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes,” Rio beamed. “I would love that.”
    </p>
<p>
     For a moment, neither of them spoke, content to sit in the bubble of bliss they had created for themselves. Agatha’s cheeks hurt from how much she was smiling, but she wouldn’t stop for the world.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did that really just happen?” she whispered, needing to check that this was real.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think so,” Rio whispered back, her smile giddy.
    </p>
<p>
     Suddenly, the shrill beeping of the coffee maker filled the kitchen, and they both jumped.
    </p>
<p>
     “Coffee’s ready,” Agatha chuckled, realizing she and Rio had both reached for each other when they were startled. They awkwardly let go of each other’s hands, and Agatha coughed, unsure of what was supposed to happen next.
    </p>
<p>
     “You know,” Rio began, her cheeks flush with a smile, “I wish you had belt loops so I could kiss you like the movies” Her fingers grasped at Agatha’s waist but closed around nothing.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha half shrugged. “Sometimes, you just have to make do with what you have,” she smirked and slipped her fingers beneath Rio’s waistband, gripping it tight and pulling her in for yet another kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio couldn’t help the mirthful laughter that escaped as they parted. “You love having your hand under my clothes, don’t you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Generally, yes, but I feel like you’re referring to something specific,” Agatha said, still gripping the helm of Rio’s pajama pants.
    </p>
<p>
     “That whole thing with my ex?” Rio asked, incredulous. Her eyes widened in disbelief when Agatha’s confused expression didn’t change. “You had your hand down my shirt the whole time! Do you really not remember that?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed nervously, clearing her throat. “I… didn’t realize I did that.” She paused as the thought sank deeper in her mind and brought her free hand to her face, hiding behind it. “Did I really do that? Oh man, I’m sorry. How did I do that and still not realize I liked you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “S’all right,” Rio drawled. “We’re all a little oblivious sometimes. You’re just really good at it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s jaw dropped in mock offense, the corners of her mouth pulling into a grin. “Actually, you know what? So what if I like having my hand there? Not my fault it’s a nice place to be.”
    </p>
<p>
     She glanced down at her hand, her gaze pointedly directed at her fingers still entangled in Rio’s waistband. Her eyebrows raised in a silent, insinuating question.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, we just started dating two seconds ago,” Rio pointed out, tipping her head to the side. “It’s a little soon, don’t you think?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fair enough,” Agatha conceded. She paused, something in Rio’s words sounding peculiar. “You just called me Agatha instead of Harkness. You’ve never done that before.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio held up a single finger. “Once before, actually.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s right,” Agatha gasped, the memory coming back to her. “On our date night. After… that whole thing with my mother. Wait, why did you stop calling me Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, the first time I did it, it was unintentional. It just slipped out.” She took a deep breath, adding, “That’s also when I realized I kinda liked you. But when I did it the second time, you looked at me funny, so I stopped.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha let the new information wash over her, almost unbelieving. “You’ve liked me since then? That was so long ago. How did you manage to survive that long?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I honestly don’t know. You didn’t make it easy, either.” Rio looked down. “For example, your hand is still in my pants, Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry about that.” Agatha quickly retracted her hand and rubbed the back of her head sheepishly. “But you know what? I like the sound of you calling me Agatha. I think I’ll start calling you Rio, Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’d like that, Agatha,” Rio said, trying to hide her cheeky smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “So… what do we do now? Agatha asked, rocking back on her heels. “It’s our last day of the vacation before we have to leave tomorrow. Might as well spend it doing something fun together.”
    </p>
<p>
     “How about a movie?” Rio suggested quickly, reaching towards her phone on the table. “I found this cute little theater in town. They have it set up like one of those old timey ones.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That sounds fun. It’s a date,” Agatha nodded. She paused, cocking her head to the side. “Wait, did you have that on hand? How did you just know about that already?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed awkwardly, rubbing her arm. “It was kind of my plan for today… until you kind of forced me to tell you about the, uh-” She gestured aimlessly to fill in the blank.
    </p>
<p>
     Suddenly, Agatha mirrored Rio’s embarrassment, glancing down. “Right. Sorry about that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio touched Agatha’s arm gently. “I was probably going to chicken out at the movies anyway. This is better.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha met her gaze, searching for signs that Rio was certain. “Are you sure? I didn’t want to put any pressure on you or anything. I was just worried, and you weren’t acting like yourself.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pulled Agatha in for a kiss by her waistband. “Positive.”
    </p>
<p>
     — — —
    </p>
<p>
     The brisk air blew at their backs as they walked along the sidewalk towards the movie theater, their steps nearly in sync. The parking spot they’d found was close, but with the cold wind and fresh coat of snow, it felt like miles. Agatha’s hands were buried deep in her pockets to protect against the biting air.
    </p>
<p>
     Crossing the street, they passed by a woman walking her dog and nodded a polite hello to her. As they reached the other side of the crosswalk, Rio bumped her shoulder against Agatha’s.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, stay on your side of the sidewalk,” Agatha chuckled and playfully glared at her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned, and Agatha realized just how much she loved the way Rio’s eyes would crinkle when she laughed at her own jokes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why? We both know you want to be close to me,” Rio teased.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do I now?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, you do.”
    </p>
<p>
     She moved to slip her hand into Agatha’s, but Agatha startled at the contact, jumping back. Her shoulders tightened as she unconsciously shoved her hands deeper in her pockets.
    </p>
<p>
     “You okay?” Rio asked, her fingers lightly resting on Agatha’s arm, trying to steady her. She tried to meet Agatha’s eyes, but her expression was miles away.
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh, yeah…” Agatha said distantly. She blinked a few times, and after a couple seconds, she was able to quiet the nerves flocking to her stomach. “Don’t know what that was.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded but still looked skeptical.
    </p>
<p>
     “I- Do you want to…” Her voice trailed off as she took her hand out of her pocket and offered it to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hesitated in taking it. “We don’t have to hold hands if you don’t want to or anything,” she said and fidgeted with the end of her sleeve, not wanting to spook Agatha again.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I do want to,” Agatha answered honestly. She met Rio’s eyes and tried to convey her conviction. There were still the faint whispers of the butterflies in her stomach, but Agatha knew that she did want this.
    </p>
<p>
     She willed her pulse to stop racing, and Rio gently took her hand. They resumed walking, everything seemingly back to normal for a minute or two, but as they continued, Agatha felt the nervousness building back up, slowly, brick by brick until she couldn’t quite conceal it anymore.
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha started to fidget with her jacket’s collar, her actions restless, Rio slowed to a stop. She looked at Agatha with renewed concern.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you sure you’re okay? You’re a little jumpy.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was quiet, trying to collect her thoughts. Rio’s steady hand by her side grounded her as she trekked through her mind, searching for the root of all this unwanted anxiety. Her eyes fixed on a salt filled crack in the sidewalk.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha tried to figure out why she was so nervous all the sudden, she couldn’t make sense of why she hadn’t been like this the whole week. Hardly anything in her actions changed. Sure, they were technically dating now, but it was still just holding hands. Nothing terrible or scary.
    </p>
<p>
     Then she realized.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha met Rio’s eyes, speaking slowly. She didn’t let herself break eye contact.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think it’s all just hitting me— that we’re, like, together and stuff. Before, it was fun and pretend, but now it’s really real and I could mess it up.” Her gaze was loving, unwavering. “I don’t want that.”
    </p>
<p>
     A look of understanding passed over Rio, and her expression softened. She took a step closer, creating a bubble around just the two of them. Their closeness captured Agatha’s entire field of vision and became her whole world.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's gaze felt like it pierced right into her soul, easily finding the deepest, most hidden part of her psyche. It was open and vulnerable, but Agatha couldn’t look away, didn’t want to look away. She never knew it was possible to trust a single person this much.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio ran her thumb over the back of Agatha’s hand. “Do you remember what we told each other after our night at the restaurant?”
    </p>
<p>
     Looking into Rio’s eyes, Agatha realized she would do anything for this woman.
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly, she said, “You told me you wouldn’t let me hold onto negative feelings if it didn’t serve me anymore.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And is this fear about us or all this newness about us helping you live in the moment of right now?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head.
    </p>
<p>
     “Right. And what did you tell me?” Rio continued, her voice soft. She clasped Agatha’s hand in both of hers and brought it to her lips, gently kissing her knuckles.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m not going to let anything push me away from you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grabbed Agatha’s other hand and held them both close to her chest, over her heart. “And am I going to push you away just because you’re afraid? Today or in any incarnation of tomorrow?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head again.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio rested her chin on Agatha’s hands and whispered, “I want you to use your words this time, my love.”
    </p>
<p>
     A beat passed before Agatha’s timid voice broke the silence, trembling.
    </p>
<p>
     “No.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s right.” Rio leaned in and stole a kiss, igniting a smile on Agatha’s lips. “Now let’s go see that movie.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took a step back, and Agatha was transported back to earth, the rest of the world picking back up where they had left off. The bubble containing just the two of them stretched and popped open, but Agatha didn’t need its protection anymore. She had Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Their intertwined hands swung proudly between them as they walked into the theater, their steps in sync with each other. Even through getting their tickets and popcorn, Agatha made sure never to let go of Rio, in this or any other endeavors.
    </p>
<p>
     She might be nervous about their young relationship but if something as simple as a few words, a reminder of their connection to each other, from Rio could calm her down then maybe this would be alright. Maybe there wasn’t a need to worry. Maybe Agatha could just sit back and enjoy a movie with her girlfriend.
    </p>
<p>
     She glanced over to Rio in the darkened theater, the light of the movie creating stark shadows on her features. Rio caught her staring and flashed her a quick smile, squeezing her hand. Agatha squeezed back, butterflies in her stomach but loving the feeling nonetheless.
    </p>
<p>
     — — —
    </p>
<p>
     A few hours later, they returned to the cabin to find the others had finished their trip to the store. The groceries were put away, and the three of them were lounging about in the living room.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha and Rio entered the kitchen, arm in arm, Agatha found it difficult to act like nothing had changed.
    </p>
<p>
     From Jen, Alice, and Lilia’s perspective, the two of them were still dating each other, just like they had been the whole time— the status quo maintained— but for Agatha, everything was different now. She had a secret she couldn’t wait to share with the world, to shout it from the rooftops.
    </p>
<p>
     She tried her best not to tip the others off yet but just couldn’t stop stealing glances at Rio, and every lingering touch seemed to spark life into her.
    </p>
<p>
     She could tell Rio felt the same, too. She caught Rio smiling at her from across the room more times than she could count, and whenever they were within arms reach of each other, Rio slipped her hand into Agatha’s. When they were sitting down, Rio always found a way to use Agatha’s shoulder as a headrest, and they stole a kiss at every turn.
    </p>
<p>
     At one point, Alice noticed their extra affection and asked them what happened while they were gone.
    </p>
<p>
     “We’ve been like this the whole time,” Agatha replied nonchalantly. She looped her arm around Rio’s waist to make her point, and Rio nodded along, agreeing.
    </p>
<p>
     “If you say so,” Alice shrugged, not quite convinced.
    </p>
<p>
     When dinner time rolled around, Agatha volunteered to cook for the group as penance for not getting groceries yesterday. Jen, Alice, and Lilia were more than happy to let her do that and broke out a deck of cards in the living room.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll help you,” Rio offered, making her way into the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t have to do that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hugged Agatha from behind, arms wrapping around her stomach and her chin finding a resting spot on her shoulder. “Why do you keep taking the blame for not getting the groceries?” she asked, quiet so the others couldn’t hear.
    </p>
<p>
     “They already believe it’s true. It’s easier to just let them keep believing it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fair enough,” Rio smiled. She took a step back, hands on her hips, and sized up the kitchen. “So, what are we making?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked Rio up and down. Her chest was puffed out, her feet were spread wide, and she had the confident look of an Olympian before their chosen sport. Agatha shook her head at the ridiculous stance and realized Rio was power posing to intimidate the stove.
    </p>
<p>
     “Calm down, Ramsay.” She took a box of uncooked pasta from the cabinet. “We’re making spaghetti.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio did not diminish her gusto, though, saluting at Agatha. “You got it, boss. I’ll make a sauce, you take the pasta.”
    </p>
<p>
     With that, they got to work on dinner. Agatha filled the pot with water and set it to boil while Rio gathered the last of the vegetables in the fridge to add to the jar of pasta sauce Jen picked up earlier.
    </p>
<p>
     Leaning against the stove, Agatha watched Rio lean over the cutting board to slice carrots, intently focusing on her work. Agatha was mesmerized by the sight, marveling at Rio’s precise skills, and remembered her fondness for knives. She wondered how often Rio cooked, but the illusion of the master chef was broken when a piece of hair fluttered in front of Rio’s eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tried to blow it out of the way, but it just came right back down. Agatha chuckled and walked over to help her. She tucked the strand behind Rio’s ear, quickly kissing her cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     Never taking her focus away from the cutting board, Rio caught Agatha’s hand as she walked back to the stove, giving it a gentle squeeze.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you,” she murmured.
    </p>
<p>
     Despite the fact Rio was still looking down, Agatha could see the corners of her mouth curling slightly upwards. Her chest fluttered with joy as she turned back to the pot of water, thinking of Rio’s hidden smile.
    </p>
<p>
     A minute later, Agatha was still staring at the pot, waiting for it to boil. Bored, she started to wander around the kitchen, opening and closing random cabinets and drawers. After she nearly dropped the toaster, Rio looked up, exasperated.
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you doing?”
    </p>
<p>
     “This water is taking forever to boil. I think it’s broken.”
    </p>
<p>
     “The stove?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, the water.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded slowly. “Uh huh… Why don’t you find something else to do to occupy yourself while you wait.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine,” Agatha grumbled.
    </p>
<p>
     She stepped back over to where Rio was cutting vegetables. Slipping an arm around her waist, Agatha nestled her face in Rio’s neck, smirking at her protests.
    </p>
<p>
     “This is not what I meant,” Rio complained. Agatha responded by burrowing deeper. “Would you cut that out? It tickles, and you’re gonna make me chop off a finger.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pulled back just enough to feign innocence, seeming to oblige Rio’s request. “We wouldn’t want that,” she smirked.
    </p>
<p>
     But before Rio could respond, Agatha leaned in again, her lips brushing softly against Rio’s neck. She sucked gently, a soft warmth finding root.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed, trying to swat her away. “This isn’t fair. I can’t focus with you doing that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I barely touched you,” she hummed, her voice low and smoky, before going back, sucking a little harder.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, please,” Rio whined, “I’m trying to cook.”
    </p>
<p>
     She stepped back, trailing her nails up Rio’s arm and reveling in the goosebumps that rose in her wake. “Only because you said please,” Agatha breathed in her ear.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio closed her eyes, taking a moment to compose herself, lips pressed in a thin line, and turned to face Agatha.  “If we weren’t dating, you know, you and your affection would be insufferable.” She gave her a quick peck on the lips, pulling back when Agatha tried to deepen it. “But since we are, I get to do it back without being a nervous wreck.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha went to open the pasta box, leaning casually on the counter, and took out a raw piece of spaghetti. She bit a piece off the end then pointed it at Rio. “But you were so cute when you were nervous.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Shut up.” Rio stole the noodle from Agatha’s hand and stuck it out of her mouth like a farmer chewing on a piece of straw. “Put the rest of these in the water.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha dumped the spaghetti into the pot. Half of it stuck out, but eventually it cooked enough that all of the pasta swirled together in the starchy water. As Agatha was straining it, Rio was putting the finishing touches on her sauce, and the other three concluded their game of Go Fish.
    </p>
<p>
     Somehow, everything had been timed perfectly, and everyone gathered around the table to eat. For once, Agatha wasn’t bothered by the cramped feeling of all five of them around the tiny table. She and Rio were seated next to each other, and their closeness gave her an excuse to find small moments of touch.
    </p>
<p>
     They were hardly two minutes into dinner before Agatha’s arm was draped over the back of Rio’s chair. She didn’t know if it was meant as a protective gesture or just a way for her to have another point of contact with Rio. In all honesty, it was probably both, but Agatha didn’t care as long as she was near Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     As Jen began a story about the cute barista she met that day, Agatha hooked her ankle around Rio’s calf. The gesture felt familiar, natural, and Rio’s hand brushed against Agatha’s knee, hovering there for a moment, the warmth of her fingers faint through the fabric.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s hand found its way to where Rio’s hand was perched on her knee, and her pinky reached out to her. Rio felt the graze against the back of her hand, glancing down, and laced their fingers together.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pulled Agatha’s hand into her lap, and their intertwined hold found a resting place on her thigh.
    </p>
<p>
     For most of the meal, Agatha was too distracted by Rio tracing shapes on the back of her hand with her index finger— and occasionally stealing forkfuls of Rio’s spaghetti when she got bored— to focus on the conversation the others were having. But when it turned to discussing the food they were eating, Agatha seized the opportunity to compliment Rio’s cooking.
    </p>
<p>
     “Who knew you were such a good cook?” she grinned at Rio, who beamed at the praise.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ve been telling her I’m good at this for ages but she always insists on eating cold beans from a can like a cavewoman,” Rio told the others. “Completely unrelated, but she’s made my kitchen look like we’re preparing for the apocalypse.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha bumped their shoulders together like a cat affectionately nudging its owner. “You’ll thank me one day,” she said with a playful smile.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio brought her hand to Agatha’s face, cupping her jaw, and guided her into a kiss. “I’m sure I will.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Woah, woah! No need to get all hot and heavy,” Jen exclaimed, putting her hand in front of Alice’s eyes. “There are children here.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I am older than you,” Alice replied.
    </p>
<p>
     “You know, Rio, since you’re great at cooking, dinner parties are a great way for couples to make new friends,” Lilia said, changing the subject. “Or to entertain their current friends.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We’d be happy to have you over for dinner, Lilia,” Rio said, picking up on her not so subtle message.
    </p>
<p>
     “I mean, the two of you’ve been dating for long enough,” Lilia continued, despite the fact Rio had already agreed. “What is it, three months now? Perfect time for you to host a party.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia leaned back in her chair while Agatha and Rio glanced at each other, knowing look in their eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha thought back to their conversation on the drive home from the movies when they discussed the terms of their bet. Rio tried to let Agatha off the hook since their situation had changed, but Agatha wouldn’t allow it. She insisted she was a woman of her word.
    </p>
<p>
     Finding Rio’s hand under the table, Agatha squeezed it three times in succession. The signal they’d agreed upon.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio raised her eyebrows slightly, only enough for Agatha to notice, to check that she was certain. Agatha knew Rio would still offer not to embarrass her in front of her friends, but she wouldn’t let that happen. Even if it wasn’t for Rio’s kindness, Agatha was curious to see how this would play out. If anything, it would entertain her for a little.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave Rio a subtle nod and squeezed her hand again, this time for reassurance.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, everyone,” Rio cleared her throat, “Agatha and I have a bit of a confession to make.”
    </p>
<p>
     If Agatha had a nickel for every time she heard that word today.
    </p>
<p>
     “Remember when I lost the gingerbread bet last night,” Agatha said, “and I said that you might find out what the stakes are depending on who wins or loses?”
    </p>
<p>
     They nodded.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha lowered her gaze, playing up her guilt for showmanship. “Well, this is the outcome that happens if I lose.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio picked it up from there. “The truth is that Agatha and I aren’t actually dating.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Dammit!” Lilia said.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha and Rio exchanged a confused look as Lilia began digging around in her pockets. A second later, she procured a ten dollar bill and handed it to Jen, slouching and crossing her arms.
    </p>
<p>
     “Did you two bet money on this?!” Agatha exclaimed.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen shrugged, flattening out the crumpled bill. “And I bet right, too.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, I believed in you!” Lilia groaned.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait, didn’t you two just kiss?” Alice asked, but no one noticed because Agatha was still making a fuss about Lilia and Jen’s wager.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, well, Jen, don’t get too attached to that money because Rio’s not done yet.” Agatha motioned for Rio to keep talking.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m so confused,” Alice whispered.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha came to me before this trip and asked if I would consider pretending to be her girlfriend for the week,” Rio continued. “All I had to do was a little acting, and I would essentially get a free vacation. I said yes, of course, because this was a prime opportunity to torment and or embarrass Agatha, and as we all know, she’s a chronic liar and these schemes of hers normally blow up in her face.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, we don’t need to drag this out,” Agatha interrupted.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, I want to hear this part,” Jen said, waving at Agatha to quiet her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio flashed Agatha a smile. “Anyway, even though we started out pretending, we have since begun a real relationship.” A beat passed. “Agatha and I are dating.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia’s jaw dropped, and she snatched the ten dollar bill out of Jen’s hand, letting out a cheer. “Ha! Suck it, Kale. Love wins again!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, rude,” Jen crossed her arms. She turned to Agatha. “Is this actually true?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice shook her head in disbelief, looking back and forth between Rio and Agatha like she was watching a tennis match. “For real?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I think I will invest this ten dollars into your wedding gift,” Lilia said, holding it at length.
    </p>
<p>
     “Maybe not,” Agatha quickly interjected, sensing Rio’s spike in nervousness. “We have not been dating anywhere near that long.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hold on, hold on,” Alice said. “Putting aside how completely insane all this is, when did you two get together? I wasn’t in on their bet—” she pointed at Jen and Lilia— “but I actually thought you guys were together the whole time. Kudos, I guess, for fooling me, but seriously, when did all this happen?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Um…” Rio suddenly found her pasta very interesting, looking down to try to hide her face.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha realized Rio always did that when she was embarrassed, and she thought it was the most precious thing ever. She loved how cute Rio acted when she got a little sheepish. Agatha made a mental note to fluster her later so she could see it again.
    </p>
<p>
     Biting her lip as she answered the question, Agatha said, “You know… this morning.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?!” Jen exclaimed, eyebrows shooting up. “Like, today?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait, but what about the kiss from playing Truth or Dare?” Lilia asked. “That was way too intense for you not to be dating yet.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha and Rio glanced at each other, eyes meeting in mutual embarrassment. Agatha noticed the blush rising in Rio’s face and could only guess she looked the same.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you telling me that the two of you just, did that? Offhand? Because Lilia told you to?” With each question, Alice got louder and more taken aback. Her eyebrows disappeared beneath her bangs, and her mouth hung slightly agape. She paused, trying to wrap her head around the information. “And you still didn’t figure anything out until several days later?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sat up straighter. “Yes, that is correct.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What about your date night at Amare? Still not dating then either?” Jen asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shook her head. “Nope.”
    </p>
<p>
     “God, what were you doing all night?” Alice exclaimed. “I was half convinced you got a motel since you came home so late. You were just talking that whole time? About what?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Just about whatever came up,” Agatha shrugged. “It didn’t even seem that late when we got back. The night just slipped away from us.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia’s grin was a mile wide, and she clasped her hands beneath her chin. “You two are adorable.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What are you talking about?” Agatha looked at Lilia quizzically. “I was just talking  about what we did.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio propped her chin in her hand, staring at her, exasperated. “Agatha. Nobody says things like ‘the night slipped away from us.’” She sighed and shook her head. “ How did you figure out you liked me back when you’re this oblivious all the goddamn time?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha spread her hands, palms up, and muttered, “I don’t know.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait, no, no, don’t skip over the story,” Lilia said quickly. “What is this ‘liked me back’ business? I want all the details. Spare nothing.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha and Rio looked at each other again before devolving select details of their blooming young relationship to their nosy friends; though it was mostly Lilia asking all the questions. They didn’t give her every single anecdote she requested, wanting to keep at least a couple things to themselves, but they revealed enough to sedate her curiosity as the meal quietly wound down.
    </p>
<p>
     Later that night, the two of them were packing their things, preparing to check out of the rental tomorrow morning. They were both sad to go, but there was something exciting about the prospect of returning to their normal lives together. Not as merely coworkers, but as girlfriends.
    </p>
<p>
     Trying to pack her clothes, Agatha kept having to steal things back from Rio. When she had put Agatha’s clothes away for her, Rio had mixed them together, something Agatha retroactively suspected was on purpose, and now they had to sort them out.
    </p>
<p>
     Luckily, it didn’t take too long, and Agatha soon had all of her clothes back, except for one hoodie. It was an old, worn gray hoodie with “Bohner Family Reunion: Pitch a Tent” written in faded red text, but she still loved it and didn’t want to accidentally leave it at the cabin.
    </p>
<p>
     She searched through all the drawers and every crevice of the closet, finding nothing, until she glanced at Rio. She had been watching Agatha’s fruitless search the entire time, and Agatha only now realized why. She looked at her across the room with a faint smirk tugging at the corner of her mouth.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ve been wearing it this whole time,” Agatha sighed, propping her hand on her hip.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned. “This isn’t even everything I stole from you.” She patted her suitcase with a proud smile as Agatha shook her head. “Probably half of this isn’t mine.”
    </p>
<p>
     “How many of my clothes did you steal this week?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not too many. Just here and there.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Just here and there,” Agatha mimicked in a high pitched voice. She broke into a smile. “What am I going to do with you?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s not stealing if your clothes look better on me,” Rio laughed, fluffing the hem of the hoodie.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow, moving to close the space between them. “Better on you, you say?”
    </p>
<p>
     She lightly grabbed Rio’s wrist and raised her arm, examining the way the jacket settled on her body. Rio’s eyes traced her every movement, and when Agatha flicked her gaze to meet Rio’s, she found her breathing charged and shallow.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s hand slipped beneath the collar and began gently pulling at the zipper, slowly working the hoodie off. Rio’s breath hitched with every featherlight touch along her skin as the jacket fell away and Agatha’s hands wandered lower, slipping beneath her shirt. Rio’s throat bobbed when Agatha’s cool finger pressed against her stomach, her hips subconsciously shifting forward.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s voice dropped to a whisper. “Are you sure?”

<p>
     Agatha woke up to find herself in Rio’s embrace, their limbs tangled together beneath the covers. Their clothes still layed discarded on the floor since last night, and Agatha nuzzled her face in the crook of Rio’s shoulder. The movement stirred her, and she awoke with a faint smile on her lips, kissing the top of Agatha’s head.
    </p>
<p>
     “Morning,” she mumbled, voice still hoarse from sleep.
    </p>
<p>
     “Morning,” Agatha echoed.
    </p>
<p>
     A comfortable silence settled between them and Rio lazily drew her hand up and down Agatha’s back. The gentle touch sent shivers down her spine, and she drew herself closer to Rio, craving contact.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio continued stroking her back wordlessly, and Agatha relaxed into her arms, allowing herself to enjoy the quiet of the morning. The hustle of the outside world had yet to intrude their peaceful solitude, and the sun shone bright through the frosted window, warming the room.
    </p>
<p>
     Thinking back to the other mornings where she’d woken up beside Rio, Agatha couldn’t believe how novel this felt. They had shared a bed the whole week, but only now did Agatha wake up beside her girlfriend. She closed her eyes and inhaled deeply, letting the scent of Rio fill her lungs.
    </p>
<p>
     “I like this,” Agatha murmured.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hummed and planted a kiss on her forehead. “Me too. I could stay here all day.”
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha opened her mouth to respond, their seclusion was interrupted by a series of quick knocks on the bedroom door.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey, lovebirds!” Lilia’s voice sounded through the door. She cracked it open and peeked her head in. “Just a heads up, we gotta leave kinda soon, like half an hour.” She laughed sheepishly. “We may have overslept a bit. Anyway, all your stuff is ready to go, right?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, it is, thanks,” Agatha replied quickly. She didn’t want Lilia to stick around long enough to notice that neither she nor Rio had clothes on. They were covered by the blanket, of course, but she didn’t need Lilia privy to the more intimate details of her life. “We’ll be out soon.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Alright, sounds good.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia extracted her head from the doorway, and once the door closed behind her, Agatha started to withdraw herself from Rio’s arms. She knew they still had a bit of time, but the drive home would be long and she wanted to shake out the tiredness in her muscles before being confined to a car.
    </p>
<p>
     But as she eased herself out of bed, Rio caught her arm and pulled her back.
    </p>
<p>
     “No, don’t leave yet,” she insisted, sticking her lip out like a child.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave her an apologetic smile but continued to get out of bed.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio waited until she was near the edge of the bed, almost out, before she pulled her arm back again. Agatha flopped back onto the mattress and sent a playful glare at her. Rio simply laughed and cupped her cheek, kissing Agatha until she couldn’t resist the tug of her smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio,” Agatha complained, “We can’t stay in bed all day.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not all day,” she drawled, dragging her hand down Agatha’s chest and moving, slow and deliberate, to bracket her knees around Agatha’s hips. The mattress dipped under the shifted weight. Rio leaned down to kiss the left side of Agatha’s face, her eyes alert and watching Agatha’s every movement. “Just until—” She kissed the right side— “We have—” The left side— “To go.”
    </p>
<p>
     She kissed the right side one more time to even it out, and Agatha felt a spark of heat rising below. Their eyes locked, and Agatha’s hands floated to the side of Rio’s ribs, moving on their own. Her grip on Rio was light, gentle, but it betrayed her desire.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned down, her breath warm and tingling on Agatha’s ear. “We have all the time in the world,” she whispered.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha swallowed hard. “Maybe…” she started slowly, “but wouldn’t you rather do this not in a stranger’s cabin?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s an Airbnb,” Rio said, ducking her head to kiss Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Same thing.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio went to deepen the kiss, and Agatha put up minimal resistance. She couldn’t find it in herself to deny Rio much of anything, especially not when she wanted it too, and kissed her back fervently. Her grip on Rio’s ribs flexed tighter, tiny divots forming under her fingers.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio moved lower, searching for the pulse point on Agatha’s neck.
    </p>
<p>
     “We should really go,” Agatha tried again, already knowing it was a lost cause. Her breath caught when Rio found a sensitive spot, lightly nipping at it. Rio saw her reaction and smirked. Agatha pressed her eyes shut and tried to focus. “Or at least get dressed,” she managed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why?” Rio teased.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha opened her mouth to respond, but any words died in her throat as Rio dipped lower still, leaving a trail of soft kisses down her chest to the slope of her waist, her skin thrumming with every touch.
    </p>
<p>
     — — —
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha! Rio!” Jen yelled. “Would you two hurry up? We have to go. It’s past eleven!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, shit,” Agatha exclaimed, jumping out of bed.
    </p>
<p>
     She looked at the alarm clock. It was almost ten minutes past checkout time. Her eyes widened, and she rushed to pick up last night’s outfit off the floor and throw it on. Rio, meanwhile, took her time getting out of bed and getting dressed.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha pulled her head through a wrinkled T-shirt, she pointed accusingly at Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re the worst.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s not what you were saying a minute ago.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha glared at her. “You’re unbelievable.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you,” Rio said with a slight curtsy.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh my god, I can not with you,” Agatha groaned out a laugh. She grabbed her duffel bag and slung it over her shoulder. “We are so going to be late.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio slipped into Agatha’s hoodie she had stolen last night and held the handle of her suitcase. “We already are,” she shrugged, “so we might as well enjoy our time.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We already did that,” Agatha pointed out, giving their room one last cursory look before opening the door.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sighed, following after Agatha as they stepped into the hallway. “Fine, fine. But just for the record, I was perfectly happy staying in bed.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, I got that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t sound so annoyed,” Rio teased, a light smirk forming. She looped her arm in Agatha’s. “I’m pretty sure you enjoyed yourself back there.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia stepped in front of them as they entered the kitchen. She held a grocery bag in her hand, a rectangular silhouette visible through the thin plastic.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thought you might want this,” she said, tapping her nose.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s that?” Rio asked. She tried to steal a look at the package, but Agatha was quick to hide it behind her back.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nothing, dear,” Agatha smiled sweetly, booping Rio on the nose.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio scrunched up her face, feigning annoyance, but Agatha gave her a quick kiss to bring back her smile. Lilia beamed at them.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes. “We should probably get going,” she said.
    </p>
<p>
     She and Rio had hardly taken two steps further into the kitchen before Alice walked in front of them, cutting them off. Agatha let out a frustrated exhale.
    </p>
<p>
     “You pester us to get out here then keep getting in our way.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen leaned against the counter and crossed her arms. “Lilia gave you plenty of time to get ready. Don’t blame Alice since you took so long.” She paused, the silence giving her a chance to give Agatha and Rio the once over. “Hey, speaking of, what were you guys doing in there?”
    </p>
<p>
     Their gazes met across the room, and Agatha was suddenly aware that her hair was still quite messy from… earlier. She sheepishly ran her fingers through her hair, trying to tame it, but Jen had already sized her up. She raised an eyebrow at Agatha, a knowing look in her eye.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha coughed. “Uh- like I said, we should probably get going.” She felt her face getting hot. “Don’t want the cleaning lady to hit us with a broom.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Right,” Rio agreed quickly.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen pushed herself off the counter, acquiescing her not-so-discreet accusation with a shrug.
    </p>
<p>
     With that, they did one last look over the cabin to make sure they left nothing behind, said their goodbyes to one another, and climbed into their respective cars to go home.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen’s car, however, blocked Agatha’s into the driveway, and they had to wait for her to leave. While they sat there, Rio moved to type her address onto the GPS screen, but Agatha stopped her.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s already there.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What?” Rio’s finger hovered over the Google Maps icon.
    </p>
<p>
     “Your address. It’s already saved in the GPS.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio broke into a grin. “Aww, you saved my address.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha swatted her hand away from the console. “Shut up. It saved automatically when I picked you up.”
    </p>
<p>
     She hit a couple buttons and a blue line appeared on the screen, tracing the route from the cabin back to Westview. Agatha’s shoulders dropped when she saw it was nearly two hours away.
    </p>
<p>
     “Starting route to 1187 Lincoln Street,” the automated voice said. It buffered for a moment. “Turn right onto Harcove Lane.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Automatic or not, I still think it’s cute you saved my address,” Rio smiled.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded and put the car into drive, Jen finally out of their way. Once she was occupied with driving, Rio reached into the backseat. Agatha glanced at her just in time to see her fishing the grocery bag out of the back of the car.
    </p>
<p>
     “So what is your mysterious package from Lilia all about?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re so nosy, aren’t you?” Agatha laughed, shaking her head. “Open it. It’s for you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio opened the bag and pulled out the book, turning it over in her hands. She seemed stunned to silence, her voice hardly a whisper when she spoke. “How’d you know I like Jane Austen?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I didn’t. I just thought the book looked interesting and I thought you would like it because you’re interesting, too.” Agatha ran her hand through her hair. “Oh God, I sound so cheesy right now.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And it’s Persuasion, too,” Rio said, holding the book to her chest. “I’ve been looking for this one.” She leaned over the center console to kiss Agatha’s cheek. “You’re not cheesy. It’s perfect. And so are you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took her eyes off the road for a moment to smile at Rio. “You’re too good to me, Vidal.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Vidal?” Rio asked, her hand flying dramatically to her chest. “Since when did I get bumped back to Vidal? You know what, maybe I won’t give you your gift then.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s ears perked up. “When did you manage to get me a gift? We were together the whole time.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I could ask you the same thing.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fair enough. You were in the bathroom at the bookstore.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You were moping around the tree lighting.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey!”
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you want it or not?” Rio reached into the backseat but stopped halfway, raising her eyebrows at Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And what was my name again?” Rio asked, blinking innocently.
    </p>
<p>
     “Are you still on that?” Agatha rolled her eyes. “I called you Vidal once, and it was part of a compliment.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged, retracting her hand from the backseat. “And I thought we were on a first name basis.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine.” Agatha sighed and looked over at Rio, who was clearly having fun. “Yes, I would like my gift, Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Good girl.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That was neither my last nor my first name.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You like it,” Rio replied with a grin, sticking her tongue in her cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     She reached into the backseat again and procured a small gift bag from the front pocket of her suitcase. It was a sparkly silver design and fit in the palm of her hand. When Agatha pulled up to the next red light, she passed it to her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took out the single piece of tissue paper, crumpled it, and threw it at Rio’s face. It bounced and landed at her feet, but Rio remained stoic, staring at her unamused.
    </p>
<p>
     “Open your damn gift.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha reached back into the bag and pulled out the gift. It was a small, circular wooden keychain, stained a light honey color with a glossy finish. She ran her finger along the back of it and felt a slight indent, and when she turned it over, she saw it was actually an engraving. Agatha moved her thumb to the side to read it.
    </p>
<p>
     A + R
    </p>
<p>
     Their initials were burned into the wood in fancy cursive lettering.
    </p>
<p>
     “Light’s green,” Rio said, drawing Agatha’s attention away from the gift.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha quickly tucked the keychain into the palm of her hand and accelerated as Rio kept talking.
    </p>
<p>
     “I bought that back at the beginning of the vacation, before either of us fell for the other. It was supposed to be a joke, like a fun little memento, but things have kind of changed since then so I guess it’s just a regular gift now.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s perfect,” Agatha smiled. She ran her hand down Rio’s forearm resting on the center console and intertwined their fingers, giving her a quick squeeze.
    </p>
<p>
     They stayed like this for a while, hands gently together, as Agatha drove down the winding back roads. Outside, snow capped trees blurred past the window, their sameness like visual white noise.
    </p>
<p>
     Every once in a while, Agatha would glance over to Rio and catch her mid yawn. Rio would try to stifle and hide it, but by the fourth or fifth yawn, Agatha gave her a look.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why don’t you take a little power nap?” she suggested.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged petulantly, fighting to keep her eyes open. “But I’m not tired,” she said, her speech slightly slurred.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled gently, her features softening. “No, of course you’re not.” She reached behind herself and grabbed her winter jacket hanging off the headrest, grateful she hadn’t stowed it away in her duffel bag. “You just want to rest your eyes, right?” She placed the jacket over Rio’s lap like a blanket. “Just for a little bit?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know what you’re doing,” Rio mumbled as she snuggled under the jacket, tucking the inner fleece lining under her chin.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m just taking care of my girlfriend,” Agatha said innocently.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio said nothing in response, her eyes slowly falling, the gentle hum of the engine drawing her to sleep. The sound of her breathing soon evened out to a steady cadence, and Agatha looked at her, the corner of her mouth curving up. She let out a quiet laugh through her nose and turned back to the road.
    </p>
<p>
     As she did, a pothole appeared out of nowhere. She swerved to avoid it, and Rio jostled in her seat.
    </p>
<p>
     “Huh? What happened?” she said blearily.
    </p>
<p>
     “Nothing, go back to sleep,” Agatha soothed.
    </p>
<p>
     She reached over and brushed Rio’s hair out of her face, gently petting the top of her head until Rio felt safe enough to close her eyes again. She mumbled something Agatha couldn’t make out as she drifted back to sleep, and Agatha turned her attention back to the road, taking care not to stir Rio with another pothole.
    </p>
<p>
     When another eventually appeared, she carefully maneuvered around it, and Rio stayed securely asleep. In the back of her mind, Agatha reminded herself this was a back road, but she couldn't help cursing the government for not fixing more of the potholes.
    </p>
<p>
     “Isn’t that the whole point of taxes?” she whispered to herself. “Filling these damn holes with more cement?”
    </p>
<p>
     But all she could do was keep driving, taking extra care not to wake Rio. As the miles stretched on, Agatha found it wasn’t particularly difficult, either. Almost all of her thoughts were already about Rio, and making sure she was comfortable was just another to add to the fray.
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly but surely, the miles remaining on the GPS ticked down, Agatha recognized the streets of Westview, and she could finally shut off that infernal automated voice.
    </p>
<p>
     Getting closer to Rio’s house, Agatha found she remembered the streets she had to turn on, even without the GPS guidance. Maybe she did have Rio’s address memorized after all. Not that she was about to tell Rio that.
    </p>
<p>
     The sound of tires against her gravel driveway woke Rio up, and she stretched in her seat, carding her hand through her hair.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha watched her with a new sense of apprehension gnawing at the edge of her consciousness. Was she supposed to drop Rio off and leave? Did Rio want her to come in? How was she even supposed to ask that without sounding too forward?
    </p>
<p>
     Throwing her questions aside, Agatha said, “I’ll get your stuff.”
    </p>
<p>
     She got out of the car and unloaded Rio’s suitcase from the backseat. Agatha didn’t know if Rio wanted her to stay, but she’d be damned if she didn’t carry her luggage to the door like a proper gentleman.
    </p>
<p>
     “You didn’t have to do that,” Rio said, joining Agatha in the driveway. She tried to take her suitcase back, but Agatha didn’t let her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes I did.” Agatha cupped Rio’s cheek and planted a quick kiss. When she pulled away, she offered her arm to Rio. “Allow me to escort you to the door, my lady.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re too kind, my liege,” Rio said with her best British accent.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head, trying not to break character at Rio’s terrible accent, and walked up the steps to Rio’s front door.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio fiddled with her keys until she found the right one, unlocking the door. It swung open and hit the doorstop with a gentle thud, and Agatha got her first glance into Rio’s home, into her life away from work and the chaos of Agatha’s schemes. Warm air floated onto the porch, bringing with it a homey, faintly cinnamon scent.

     Agatha stood with Rio’s suitcase in front of her like a protective wall. She didn’t move forward or back, unsure which direction was right, settling instead to shift her weight side to side.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tucked her keys in her pocket and took half a step into her house before pausing, glancing back at Agatha. It took her one look, less than a second, to soften her expression, understanding exactly where Agatha’s head was at.
    </p>
<p>
     “You don’t have to leave yet.”
    </p>
<p>
     Those six simple words brought Agatha out of her nervous spiral and curved her lips into a smile, her heart steadying. “I was hoping you’d say that.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s hand brushed against Agatha’s, and Agatha intertwined their fingers without a second thought, instinctual. They stood on the porch for a moment longer. Rio looked inside and regarded her house like it was the first time she’d seen it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Can’t believe it’s been a week.”
    </p>
<p>
     “One of my crazier weeks, too,” Agatha said, bumping their shoulders together to nudge Rio inside.
    </p>
<p>
     “One of?” Rio asked incredulously. Agatha shrugged. “Yeah, well, we really botched the whole fake dating thing, didn’t we?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, we did,” Agatha laughed. “Completely ruined it by actually falling for each other.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Tragic. Truly tragic.” Rio pushed the door shut as they stepped inside. “Guess we’ll just have to keep pretending.”
    </p>
<p>
     “But to what end?” Agatha said dramatically.
    </p>
<p>
     “Forever?” Rio leaned into her, and Agatha’s chest tightened in the best way possible.
    </p>
<p>
     “Deal.”
    </p>
<p>
     She tilted Rio’s chin up to kiss her. When they parted, Rio’s smile was uncontainable, and Agatha knew there was no better ending to their vacation.
