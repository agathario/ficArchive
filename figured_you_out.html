<div class="userstuff">
<p>“Ralph’s cheating on me.”</p><p>Coffee spilled as Wanda knocked it with her hand, the brown liquid spreading across the table between them as Wanda stood with her mouth gaping open, staring at Agatha in shock, still half-out of her seat.</p><p>Okay, maybe she should have waited until Wanda was fully sat down before opening her mouth, but Agatha hadn’t been able to wait. The words had been bubbling, desperate to be set free, ever since she’d first had her suspicions a week ago.</p><p>Wanda sat down heavily, and Agatha used a napkin to mop up the worst of the coffee, thankful there was still some left in the cup.</p><p>They were both going to need the caffeine to get through what Agatha had to say.</p><p>Around them, conversation swelled and buzzed at the other tables nestled into their favorite coffee shop. Agatha was grateful for it, in the face of Wanda’s stunned silence.</p><p>“What…” It took some time for Wanda to be able to form words. “Are you sure?”</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha was deadly certain. She cupped her hands around her black coffee and took a long sip. “I have proof.”</p><p>“Oh, Agatha.” Wanda reached across the table to wrap a hand around Agatha’s wrist, squeezing gently. “I’m so sorry.”</p><p>In the face of her friends sympathy, Agatha shifted in her seat. “It’s fine.” Wanda’s eyebrows shot up, and Agatha sighed. “Well, I mean it’s not <em>fine</em>, but it’s…” She bit at her bottom lip. “We haven’t been happy for a long time.” Hadn’t had sex in even longer. “I should have seen it coming. I just wish he’d had the sense of mind to ask me for a divorce, first.”</p><p>The thought of him slipping into her bed—even if it was just to roll over and fall asleep snoring, facing the wall, careful not to touch her—after being with another woman made her sick.</p><p>But it was for all the wrong reasons. It wasn’t because she was heartbroken, or jealous. She didn’t care that in the lack of their own intimacy, he’d chosen to stick his dick in someone else instead of pestering her, growing sullen when she turned him down.</p><p>She was angry because he had forced her to continue their sham of a marriage. Couldn’t he have just told her he wanted to leave, instead of dragging it on like this?</p><p>And Agatha knew she could have been the one to pull the plug. They’d been flatlining for years, barely managing to keep themselves afloat—if not for Nicky, Agatha would have left Ralph a long time ago.</p><p>But she’d fallen pregnant, when they’d been near breaking point, after one night of weakness when she’d had too much wine and given in to his clumsy advances. And though she hadn’t been sure she’d wanted a child—how could she be sure, when her own childhood had been so terrible?—as soon as she’d seen the positive pregnancy test, as soon as she’d seen his tiny little body on the ultrasound, felt his strong kicks in her belly, she’d known motherhood was something she was destined for.</p><p>And she hadn’t wanted Nicky to grow up in a broken home, like she had.</p><p>So, she’d stayed, even though she wasn’t happy.</p><p>(Even though, with Ralph, she could never be happy. Not when her hand had been forced by her mother to marry him in the first place, not when she could not stop dreaming at night of softer skin, of plumper lips, of curves and sighs and the wet, silken flesh between parted thighs—</p><p>Agatha shook her head.</p><p>Now was not the time to dwell on her fantasies.)</p><p>“What are you going to do?” Wanda asked, her thumb rubbing smooth circles on the skin of Agatha’s wrist, tearing her out of her thoughts. “Have you confronted him, yet?”</p><p>“Not yet. I wanted to get my affairs in order first.” Wanted to make sure she had enough proof gathered that he wouldn’t be able to fight her. For when—not if, but <em>when</em>—they divorced, Agatha would not settle for anything less than full custody of Nicky. Ralph could maybe, <em>maybe</em>, take the occasional weekend. Nothing more. “Make sure I had everything I needed.”</p><p>“And do you? How did you figure it out?”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “He’s been going on a lot of “work trips” lately. I didn’t question it at first.” Didn’t care where Ralph was, if it wasn’t in her house, in her bed. “Until I noticed a bill for a hotel room in Eastview for two nights while he was supposed to be in New York on business.” Ralph had been careless to leave the bank statement where Agatha could find it. And once she’d seen it… she’d started digging. “When I looked deeper into it, there were dozens more hotel bookings corresponding to the dates he was out of town. Cash withdrawals, presumably for dinner or gifts. And then I checked his phone records. There’s a number he keeps calling, a few days before each “trip”, and then the day of. I can only assume that it’s hers.”</p><p>“You weren’t kidding when you said you had the evidence. Though I guess I shouldn’t have expected any less from you, Professor Harkness. You do love your research.”</p><p>“I usually find it more enjoyable than this, though.” Agatha’s slog to achieve her history doctorate degree had even been preferrable. “I want to ring the number.”</p><p>Wanda withdrew her hand, and shot Agatha an incredulous look. “Do you think that’s a good idea?”</p><p>No, she didn’t. But… “I want to speak to her. I want to know if she knew he was married. That he had a family.”</p><p>“I just don’t know if that’s the wisest thing to do Agatha…”</p><p>“I need to know.” Agatha met Wanda’s gaze, her voice strong. “I want to see her.”</p><p>The way Wanda bit her bottom lip suggested she still thought Agatha was making an idiotic decision, but she didn’t argue. “Well, if you need anything, you just give me a call, okay? And if you need me to watch Nicky for you while you and Ralph figure everything out, you just let me know. It wouldn’t be any trouble.”</p><p>Agatha felt a flutter of relief, glad she had Wanda in her corner. She hadn’t been sure, when she’d originally put everything together, that she could be strong enough to leave Ralph. For twenty years, she’d allowed herself to be worn down, to accept her life the way it was—deliriously happy when it came to Nicky, to her job, but numb when it came to her marriage. Too terrified of her mother’s reaction, to the reaction of her peers if she suddenly found herself single at the age of forty-two, terrified Nicky would blame her for breaking up their family.</p><p>But she knew, with Wanda’s soft smile on her face, and conviction in her heart, that she could do this.</p><p>She wasn’t naïve. It wouldn’t be easy. Navigating life as a single parent, even if Nicky was getting older—ten, now, going on thirty—would be an adjustment. And the phone call she would receive from Evanora Harkness when she heard the news…</p><p>Well.</p><p>Agatha might just try and avoid that one for as long as possible.</p><p>But she was forty-two, and she felt like she’d been moving through life with her eyes closed, on autopilot, for the last… God. Too many years of her life. It was time for her to grow a backbone, to stand up for what she wanted.</p><p>And what she wanted, more than anything else, was to be free of the shackles that had been forced upon her ever since she was a child.</p><p>She wanted to live her life, finally, without the weight of other’s expectations of her heavy on her shoulders.</p><p>And her first step, after accepting Wanda’s offer and asking if Nicky could stay the night, was a trip to her divorce lawyer.</p><p>Before she called the phone number that she’d already memorized, the digits burned into the back of her eyelids whenever she blinked.</p><p> </p><p align="center">* * *</p><p align="center"> </p><p>After spending two hours with her attorney—who was hopeful a resolution could be reached quickly, if Ralph was compliant and didn’t fight it—Agatha returned home. She’d taken a rare personal day, leaving her classes with reading to do.</p><p>It wouldn’t kill them, just for a day.</p><p>Agatha glanced at the clock. Three p.m. Wanda had agreed to collect Nicky from school when she picked up her own twins, meaning Agatha had nothing to do but wait until Ralph came home to confront him.</p><p>But first…</p><p>She wanted to see who he’d been spending his time with.</p><p>So, with shaking fingers, Agatha picked up her phone, and dialed the number she’d memorized. It rang once, twice, three times, and Agatha wondered if maybe no one was going to pick up, heart sinking at the thought.</p><p>But then—</p><p>“Hello.” The feminine voice was low, husky—<em>young</em>. “How may I be of service to you today?”</p><p>“Um…” Of <em>service</em>? Agatha frowned, pulling the phone away from her ear and checking she’d dialed the right number. “I… I’m not sure.”</p><p>“Not sure?” The voice sounded amused, sweet in Agatha’s ear. “Come on, don’t be shy.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, feeling completely thrown off-guard, like she was missing out on an inside joke. “Who’s speaking?”</p><p>“I think I’d rather hear your name first, sweetheart.”</p><p>Agatha rankled at the tone, at the pet name, the familiarity—and then froze. Was she not speaking to Ralph’s affair partner after all, but a sex worker he’d hired, instead? “Who is this?”</p><p>Something in her tone must have alerted the woman that something was amiss. “How did you get this number?” The voice switched from playful to commanding.</p><p>Agatha swallowed. “My husband. He’s been calling it. A lot.”</p><p>A sigh echoed into her ear. “For fuck’s sake. Without telling you, I’m guessing?”</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha listened to the quiet sound of the other woman’s breathing. “Is this… what do you do?” It sounded slightly less accusatory than <em>are you a sex worker</em>, at least. “What’s <em>he </em>been doing?”</p><p>“I don’t know if we should do this over the phone.”</p><p>At that, Agatha’s heart raced. For even though a part of her had wanted that, had wanted to gaze upon the face of the woman who Ralph had been spending so much of his time with, the unexpected turn the conversation had taken had thrown her.</p><p>Agatha did not like knowing what she was walking into. She needed facts, needed knowledge, hated the unknown.</p><p>And yet…</p><p>She was intrigued. How could she possibly hang up the phone now? How could she confront Ralph without knowing all the dirty details? She’d thought she had known what he was up to, but now… “Okay. Tell me where to meet you.”</p><p>“Direct.” The voice sounded appreciative. “You got a pen?”</p><p>“Yes.” An address was drawled into Agatha’s ear, and she wrote it down carefully. She recognized the zip code—it was downtown, in the suburbs. Not somewhere Agatha would have expected. “When?”</p><p>“I’ll be here for the next few hours.”</p><p>“I can be there in thirty minutes.”</p><p>Agatha hung up without waiting for a response, heart in her mouth as she glanced at the paper on her kitchen table, and the hastily scrawled address that sat there. What the hell was she about to walk into?</p><p> </p><p align="center">* * *</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Twenty-eight minutes later, Agatha pulled up outside a nondescript townhouse on the outskirts of Westview. The lawn was well-tended to, flowers of all colors and sizes blooming wherever Agatha looked.</p><p>Not what she had expected.</p><p>Maybe she should have listened to Wanda. Because if she had, Agatha would be sitting at home right now, quietly stewing over Ralph’s transgressions, and not staring at a front door halfway across town feeling like a hand was wrapped around her throat.</p><p>As Agatha sat, watching, the front door opened.</p><p>And in the doorway stood the most stunning woman Agatha had ever seen.</p><p>Young—maybe mid to late twenties, with dark hair that curled around her shoulders. She wore black leather pants that looked molded to her skin, and a black tank top that revealed the sleeve of tattoos on her left arm, a skull and swirling vines that curled over her shoulder. The muscles in those arms… they flexed as she lifted an arm to wave toward where Agatha sat, trapped behind the wheel of her sedan.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, throat tight, as she fumbled with the doorhandle. She almost pitched herself face-first onto the sidewalk, struck dumb by the sight of her. Painted red lips curved into a smirk as Agatha approached, and the woman gave her a once-over, from head to toe, with warm brown eyes.</p><p>So warm, in fact, that Agatha felt scorched by the heat of her gaze.</p><p>Felt her knees tremble as she reached the front step.</p><p>What was she <em>doing</em>? This was the woman that Ralph had been calling. And the thought that he had been with her, touched her—</p><p>The thought that <em>he </em>had touched her and Agatha had not—</p><p>God.</p><p>She needed a shower. A cold one. An ice bath, even. Maybe a slap. Anything to sort her mind out, to stop herself spiraling. To remember how to form words with the weight of those brown eyes settled on her face.</p><p>“Hello.” Yep, definitely the right woman. Agatha would recognize that voice anywhere. “You still haven’t told me your name.”</p><p>“You still haven’t told me yours.”</p><p>The smirk widens to show white teeth, and the woman waved an arm to beckon Agatha inside the house.</p><p>Agatha stepped over the threshold, casting her gaze around, but found little to look at. The white walls were blank, not a single photo in sight, the wooden floors clear of any clutter. It was all… startlingly impersonal.</p><p>Almost like it was a show-home.</p><p>Like no one lived there at all.</p><p>Agatha’s sense of unease grew as she was led into the kitchen, which was just as plain as the hallway.</p><p>“Can I get you anything to drink?” The woman followed her in, directing Agatha to a chair at the kitchen table.</p><p>“No, thank you.”</p><p>“Very well.” The woman sat opposite her, splaying her fingers on the table, her painted black nails standing out sharply against the wood. “Now, my name. Most people call me Mistress Muerte, but you can call me Rio.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth went dry. “M-mistress.”</p><p>“Mhmm.” The woman—<em>Rio</em>, because Agatha was absolutely not going <em>near </em>that other name—drew out the syllables, nails tapping against the table.</p><p>“So, you’re a…” Agatha trailed off, unable to finish the thought.</p><p>Rio had no such qualms. “Dominatrix,” she finished, tilting her head to one side, her eyes intense on Agatha’s face, assessing her reaction. “Yes.”</p><p>Agatha felt like the world was falling out from underneath her. “So that means that my husband…” Agatha scrubbed a hand across her face. <em>Fucking </em>Ralph. “God.”</p><p>“I’m sorry.” Rio did look apologetic. “I know that can’t be easier to hear.”</p><p>“No, it’s not.” Tired of being studied, Agatha studied Rio in return. “Awfully bold of you to invite me here to be with you, alone. Considering what they say about a woman scorned.”</p><p>Rio laughed, the sound soft. “You didn’t sound angry on the phone. Plus, I can handle myself.” Glancing again at Rio’s toned arms, Agatha didn’t doubt it. “And I was… intrigued by the sound of your voice. Curious what you’d look like. You by far exceeded my expectations.”</p><p>Okay. Was this woman <em>flirting </em>with her?</p><p>And was Agatha’s heart racing because of it?</p><p>“You’ve slept with my husband.” Agatha needed to remind herself of that, before she did something stupid like flirted <em>back</em>.</p><p>A shadow crossed Rio’s face. “No, I haven’t. One, because despite what most people assume, that’s not part of what I do. And two, because it wasn’t me he’s been seeing.”</p><p>“Sorry.” Agatha found she didn’t like that look on Rio’s face—like she was disappointed by what Agatha had said. “I didn’t mean to be so accusatory. I don’t… I don’t know anything about this.”</p><p>Rio arched an eyebrow. “Would you like to?”</p><p>It took a herculean effort for Agatha not to react, not to tug at the collar of her shirt—had it always been so tight?—not to fan at her overheated cheeks. “Wait. If it’s not you, then who? And how do you know? I haven’t told you his name.”</p><p>“Don’t need to.” Rio leaned back in her chair and lifted her leg, resting her foot on the seat and her cheek on her knee. “I only take women as clients. My colleague handles the men.”</p><p>There were so many things to unpack about that sentence that Agatha didn’t even know where to start. “You… you have a colleague?” She figured that would be the safest plan of attack.</p><p>“Yes. If you’d like to accuse <em>her </em>of sleeping with your husband, I can give you her contact details.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “I don’t think that will be necessary.”</p><p>“Okay. If it helps, I can assure you she takes the same stance as I do—no sexual favors of any kind.”</p><p>“Then what <em>do </em>you do?” It escaped before Agatha could bite it back, her curiosity, her thirst for knowledge, too strong for her to suppress.</p><p>Judging from the sparkle in Rio’s eyes, the quirk of her lips into yet another wicked smirk, Agatha had asked exactly the right question. “Well, it depends on the client. Some of them want to be punished—whipped, spanked, or choked. Some of them want to be tied up. Some of them just want me to tell them how good they are.”</p><p>Curling her hands around the edge of her seat, Agatha struggled not to react to Rio’s words. Because her reaction was <em>visceral</em>, her heart pounding and an uncomfortable ache settling between her thighs.</p><p>Because something else that was too strong for her to suppress?</p><p>Her complete and total weakness when it came to attractive women, no matter how deeply she’d tried to bury it.</p><p>And Rio…</p><p>She was everything Agatha had ever fantasized about.</p><p>“If you tell me your husband’s name, I can find out why he came to us. What he asked for. Maybe figure out why he didn’t feel comfortable sharing that fantasy with you.”</p><p>Agatha laughed before she could help it.</p><p>Rio watched her, eyebrow raised again.</p><p>“Our marriage was dead a long time ago,” Agatha said, unsure why she felt the need to share that fact with this beautiful stranger. “That’s why.”</p><p>“Ah. Not something you want to try and save?”</p><p>“No.” Even knowing that Ralph hadn’t had a mistress in the traditional sense of the word, but a <em>Mistress</em> he paid to—well, Agatha really didn’t need to know the details—it didn’t change anything.</p><p>There was no saving their marriage.</p><p>She did not <em>want </em>to.</p><p>This had just been the wake-up call she’d needed.</p><p>“Well, thank you.” Agatha had heard enough, needed to get away and get home before she spent another second in Rio’s magnetizing presence. She stood, the legs of her chair scraping against the tiled floor. “For your time. I appreciate it.”</p><p>“You’re welcome.” Rio followed her to the door, steps quiet in comparison to the click of Agatha’s heels. “And if you ever find yourself with more questions…” Rio trailed off, then leaned in close, her breath warm against the shell of Agatha’s ear, “or feel like making an appointment… just give me a call.”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks flamed, her heart racing, and without another word—with Rio’s quiet laughter ringing in her ears—Agatha fled from the house like she was being chased.</p><p>She should have <em>definitely </em>listened to Wanda.</p><p>Because meeting Rio?</p><p>In her forty-two years of life, Agatha had <em>never </em>felt like that before. Never felt so dumb-struck by the mere sight of another person, by the husk of a voice…</p><p>Never been so intrigued about an occupation.</p><p>She thought about what Rio had said—of punishments and handcuffs and <em>good girls</em>—and floored the gas, tearing down the street like she could outrun her stupid, horny brain.</p><p>Like she could outrun the image of Rio, standing in her doorway and watching Agatha go.</p><p> </p><p align="center">* * *</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Later, when Ralph arrived home, Agatha confronted him with all of her carefully collected proof.</p><p>(She did not mention going to see Rio. Ralph did not need to know that. Instead, she pretended she’d found the agency—for a google search revealed that Rio did, in fact, run an agency, with a legitimate website, and the list of services written on there were seared into Agatha’s mind.)</p><p>She tried not to be too accusatory.</p><p>Tried to present her findings like it was a lecture, with no emotion—and then he said he wouldn’t have had to turn to paid services if she wasn’t such a frigid bitch, and that at least he hadn’t been having an actual affair, like she should be <em>grateful</em>, and all of Agatha’s composure flew out of the window.</p><p>He didn’t fight when she kicked him out. He didn’t even fight for Nicky—barely blinking when she said she wanted full custody.</p><p>She knew Ralph had checked out of being her husband a long time ago, but she hadn’t realized he’d checked out of being a father, too.</p><p>A mere hour after arriving home—as if an hour as all it took to dissolve the marriage she’d spent twenty years trapped in—Ralph left with a car packed full of his belongings. To where, Agatha didn’t know—probably his mother’s. She would no doubt fawn all over her perfect son (for she believed he’d never done a thing wrong in his life), and curse at Agatha for kicking him out.</p><p>Agatha might actually get on better with her own mother than she did with Ralph’s.</p><p>Which was saying something.</p><p>With him gone, Agatha sat in the dark in her living room with a glass of wine. The TV was playing but she didn’t pay any attention to the screen. Tomorrow she would have to deal with what came next—telling Nicky, more calls with her lawyer, actually filing for divorce and trying to figure out how the hell they were going to separate their assets—but tonight all she needed to do was mourn the pathetic and sorry state of her life.</p><p>And try not to think about the last number she’d called.</p><p>The ache Rio’s mere presence had awakened inside her.</p><p>Agatha didn’t remember the last time she’d felt desire. Not like this—heady and powerful. Addictive.</p><p>And impossible.</p><p>If Agatha was finally going to embrace who, deep down, she’d always known she was—if she was finally, finally, going to pursue intimacy with another woman, it wouldn’t be because she’d paid for it.</p><p>No matter how tempting the offer.</p>

<p>“Hurry up, Mom! We’re going to be late.” Nicky’s impatient voice rang from by the front door as Agatha hopped on one foot, tugging on her favorite pair of worn sneakers.</p><p>“I’m coming, I’m coming.” Grabbing her jacket, Agatha let Nicky push her out of the front door and toward the car.</p><p>Agatha was not adjusting to life as a single parent super well.</p><p>Some days, it was fine. Ralph hadn’t always been the most helpful, anyway, so Agatha sometimes had <em>less </em>chores to do, now that there was one less person in the house. But other days, the hot water stopped working—meaning she’d had to have a cold shower, because it was a Saturday, so naturally the soonest someone could come out to look at it was Monday—and you run out of food for the rabbit—because that had used to be Ralph’s job, seeing as he was the one that brought the damn thing home in the first place—so have to make an emergency trip to the pet store as soon as it opened.</p><p>Needless to say, Agatha was already exhausted.</p><p>And instead of enjoying her Saturday, she had to go and watch Nicky’s soccer team play.</p><p>She loved her son, she really, really did, but… she <em>hated </em>soccer. Standing around on the sidelines did not sound like the most appealing afternoon in the world, but it was his first game, and he was so excited she didn’t have the heart to stay at home.</p><p>At least Wanda would be there, seeing as Billy and Tommy were also on the team.</p><p>Agatha blamed Wanda and her twins for Nicky’s newfound soccer obsession—he hadn’t been interested in it until his friends had joined the Westview boys team. But, seeing as they practiced in the park across from the boys’ school three nights a week, it did mean she only had to sort childcare for two nights a week rather than all five.</p><p>“I hope we win.” Nicky chewed at his thumbnail as Agatha drove toward the park, and Agatha reached across the center console to knock it from his mouth.</p><p>“It’s not all about winning,” Agatha said, because she knew she was supposed to. “As long as you have fun. Aren’t you excited?”</p><p>“Yeah. And you’ll get to meet the new coach! She’s awesome.”</p><p>Ah yes, the mysterious Coach Vidal Nicky had been gushing about for the past few weeks. Wanda picked the boys up from practice, dropping Nicky at home seeing as they only lived one street over, so Agatha was yet to meet the woman who had entranced her son.</p><p>Agatha had barely parked the car before Nicky was pushing open the door, racing over toward Tommy and Billy before Agatha could blink. Shaking her head—<em>boys</em>—she followed after him at a much more reasonable pace.</p><p>“Hey, Agatha.” Wanda smiled from beside Vision by the side of the soccer field. “How are you doing?”</p><p>“I’m okay.”</p><p>Wanda raised an eyebrow, as if pressing for more detail, but Agatha merely shrugged. She <em>was </em>okay. She didn’t miss Ralph—aside from his pet store contributions. It was nice having the living room to herself when Nicky went to bed, nice being able to watch whatever she wanted on the TV without judgement.</p><p>Most of all, it was nice to be able to stretch out in bed, knowing she had it all to herself.</p><p>Mostly, she was annoyed at herself for waiting so long.</p><p>Even Nicky seemed to be coping relatively well, thanks to the therapy Agatha had enrolled him as soon as she’d broken the news. He still saw Ralph after school twice a week while Agatha caught up on grading assignments, and he would be spending next weekend with him at his grandmother’s house.</p><p>All in all, things had gone smoothly, aside from the fact she and Ralph didn’t talk unless it was to discuss pick up and drop off for their boy.</p><p>“Really,” Agatha said, knocking Wanda’s shoulder with her own. “I am.”</p><p>“Okay.” Wanda slipped her arm through Agatha’s, leaning closer to her instead of her husband. “Are you <em>thrilled </em>to be here?”</p><p>“Oh, of course.” Agatha turned an accusing eye toward Vision. “I’m blaming you for this.”</p><p>“Me?” He pressed a hand to his chest. “What have I done?!”</p><p>“You infested Billy and Tommy’s impressionable young brains with your love of soccer, and they’ve brought my son over to the darkside.”</p><p>Vision grinned. “It’s not my fault it’s a beautiful game, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, casting her gaze over the field to where the boys had started to warm up. She assumed the woman in the sweatpants and hoodie with <em>Westview Boys Soccer </em>emblazoned on the back was the Coach Vidal. She had her back to Agatha, her hair scraped into a high pony, and when she turned her head slightly, the breath rushed out of Agatha as a gasp.</p><p>Because she recognized that face.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>“Holy shit.”</p><p>“What?” Wanda glanced at Agatha, head tilted to one side, eyes widening when she saw the look of horror on Agatha’s face. “Agatha? What’s wrong?”</p><p>How on Earth could Agatha possibly begin to explain that?</p><p>She had <em>not </em>told Wanda about her visit to Rio.</p><p>Wanda had asked if Agatha had called the number, and she’d said she’d lost her nerve. Lied, because she hadn’t wanted to tell Wanda about it. Hadn’t wanted to air Ralph’s dirty laundry, but also hadn’t wanted to think about the way Rio had made her feel.</p><p>The fact that Rio’s number haunted her.</p><p>How many times her dreams, her fantasies, over the past few weeks had worn Rio’s face—her dark eyes, her tanned skin, her flexing muscles.</p><p>“It—nothing.” Agatha tried to tear her gaze away from Rio, but before she had the chance, Rio’s head turned further—and her eyes landed on Agatha.</p><p>Even from a few feet away, Agatha saw the recognition. Saw Rio’s eyes widen, saw a flicker of panic flash across her stupidly beautiful face.</p><p>Wanda eyed Agatha closely. “You sure?”</p><p>“Uh-huh.”</p><p>She noticed Rio’s stare, still locked on Agatha. “You haven’t met the coach yet, have you? She’s great with the boys.”</p><p>Agatha wondered if Wanda would think that if she knew what Rio’s other job entailed. Then she shook her head—she shouldn’t judge.</p><p>She was just roiling from the sight of Rio.</p><p>Rio’s attention was pulled away from Agatha as Nicky raced over, tugging lightly on Rio’s sleeve. She bent so she was closer to his eye level, listening intently to whatever he was chattering about, and Agatha refused to think about the way it made something warm squirm through her chest.</p><p>“She seems it,” Agatha said, when she realized Wanda was waiting for a response.</p><p>“Are you sure you’re okay?” Wanda’s hand pressed against Agatha’s cheeks. “You look a little flushed.”</p><p>Yes, because she was thinking about Rio whispering <em>if you feel like making an appointment, give me a call </em>into her ear.</p><p>It had been hard enough to ignore the temptation when all she had was a phone number.</p><p>When that temptation was standing less than five feet away from her?</p><p>How was Agatha supposed to ignore <em>that</em>?</p><p>“I’m fine,” Agatha said, and this time it <em>was </em>a lie. She might never be fine ever again. Because Nicky loved soccer, and he would hate her for taking it away from him after there was so much turbulence in the rest of his life, so that meant she was going to have to <em>keep seeing </em>Rio.</p><p>Agatha wanted to put her head in her hands, or scream into a pillow, or punch something with all of her weight behind it.</p><p>But instead, she had to stand on the side of a soccer field and watch a game she hadn’t even wanted to watch in the <em>first </em>place, let alone now.</p><p>As the game kicked off, Agatha made sure to keep her eyes solely on Nicky. She absolutely, categorically, did not allow herself to look toward where Rio stood on the other side of the field. She did not allow herself to listen out for the sound of her voice as she shouted orders at the kids.</p><p>(She did <em>not </em>allow herself to think of Rio shouting other kind of orders, her husky voice close to Agatha’s ear, telling her to—</p><p><em>No</em>.)</p><p>Thankfully, it did not last as long as a full soccer match. Agatha only had to stand there for thirty minutes total.</p><p>By the end, she was almost as exhausted as Nicky looked as he embraced his teammates, all of them congratulating one another on a hard-fought win.</p><p>“We said we’d take the boys out for ice cream afterwards to celebrate,” Wanda said. “Would you and Nicky like to join us?”</p><p>The thought of eating something cold, of shocking Rio out of her system (of having Wanda, Vision, Billy, Tommy <em>and </em>Nicky as a distraction to help drown out her dangerous thoughts) was too tempting for Agatha to ignore. “Sounds great.”</p><p>The boys race over to them after being released by their coach, and Agatha wrapped Nicky up in a tight hug. “You did so well today, sweetheart.”</p><p>“Thanks, Mom.” He squeezed her back tight, and Agatha knew it wouldn’t be too much longer before he’d be too old and embarrassed for her hugs.</p><p>“How does ice cream with the Maximoff’s sound?”</p><p>He beamed. “Awesome!”</p><p>But before they could make their escape, a voice called out behind them, stopping Agatha in her tracks.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>“Hey, wait. Um… Nicky’s mom, can I talk to you for a sec?” She sounded nothing like the cool, calm and collected woman Agatha had met the other week. She didn’t look it, either, her hands buried in the pockets of her hoodie, slouched so that instead of standing a few inches taller than Agatha, they were the same height.</p><p>Agatha could feel Wanda’s eyes on her. The burn of them, the curiosity in them. It made her want to shrink away and hide.</p><p>But she knew saying no would only open herself up to more questions. Her hand was forced (but, importantly, not <em>tied</em>). “Okay.”</p><p>“We’ll take Nicky down to the ice cream parlour,” Wanda said, a hand wrapping around Nicky’s shoulder. “You can meet us there when you’re done?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t know what would be worse—them being close enough to overhear, or them leaving her alone with Rio. “Sure. I won’t be long.”</p><p>“Good game today, Coach Vidal.” Wanda flashed Rio a warm smile. “Good to get off to a winning start.”</p><p>“Sure is. You all had a great game today, boys. I’ll see you all on Monday for practice.” Rio injected some cheer into her voice, but to Agatha’s ears, it fell flat. She waited until Wanda, Vision and the boys were out of earshot before her mouth opened again. “Please believe me when I say that if I’d known you were a parent to a kid on my team, I never would have met up with you.”</p><p>“Isn’t that a risk you run?” Agatha refused to look Rio in the eye, not sure she had the strength to withstand it. “Some of your clients must be mothers.”</p><p>“They are. But I’d expect a certain level of confidentiality from my clients, just as they would from me. But you…” Rio swallowed. “You don’t owe me that. And I’d really like to keep this job.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, finally meeting Rio’s gaze. “I can’t promise I won’t tell Wanda, because she’s like a dog with a bone when she thinks I’m keeping a secret, but I <em>can </em>promise it will never go further than that. She wouldn’t tell anyone. And she won’t judge you, either.”</p><p>Some of the panic eased from Rio’s expression. “Okay. I appreciate that.” Her lips quirked into a smile. “Nicky’s mom.”</p><p>Agatha found herself smiling back. “It’s Agatha.”</p><p>“That’s a beautiful name for a beautiful woman.”</p><p>Agatha felt her cheeks warm, her smile dropping. “You’re not allowed to do that.”</p><p>Rio inched closer. “Do what?”</p><p>“Flirt with me.”</p><p>“Was I?”</p><p>“Oh, so do you call all the moms beautiful?”</p><p>That damn smirk was back. “Maybe. Or maybe I only do it with the ones that react to it.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “Well, stop it. I’m probably twice your age.”</p><p>“I’m twenty-nine, so if you’re fifty-eight, you look really fucking good for your age.”</p><p>God, this woman was incorrigible. But a part of Agatha was relieved Rio wasn’t as young as she’d first feared. “I’m forty-two, which is still much too old for you.”</p><p>“Then you haven’t seen some of my clients.”</p><p>Once again, Agatha’s cheeks warmed at the thought of what, exactly, Rio might do with those clients. She hadn’t blushed so much since she was a girl, and she was furious at her body’s betrayal. She was acting like she was a teenager, for fuck’s sake. “Yes, well. I’m not interested in being one of your clients.”</p><p>“Okay, Agatha.” Rio managed to make it sound disbelieving.</p><p>Agatha had to force herself not to growl. “How do you even end up with these jobs, anyway? They’re not exactly similar.”</p><p>“I don’t know. I get to shout orders in both.” Rio grinned. “But on a serious note—both are just temporary. I need the cash. And I love being in control, and I love soccer, so.” She shrugged. “They both do make sense, in their own way.”</p><p>“Sure.” Agatha cleared her throat, aware that every other parent and child had left the field, leaving her and Rio completely alone. Her skin felt like it was buzzing. “Well, I should really get going.”</p><p>“Okay. Thanks for talking to me. And for keeping my secret.”</p><p>“Don’t mention it—please.” Agatha drew her jacket tighter around her torso. “Goodbye, Rio.”</p><p>“See you around, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha sighed.</p><p>Because unfortunately, she would.</p><p> </p><p align="center">* * *</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Wanda waited a whole five seconds before she asked Agatha about what Rio had wanted to say to her.</p><p>Agatha was impressed she’d waited that long. “She just wanted to tell me how well Nicky played today.”</p><p>Nicky beamed around a mouthful of mint chocolate chip ice cream.</p><p>But Wanda didn’t buy it, leaning in close so the boys—and Vision—couldn’t hear her next words. “Are you forgetting I always know when you’re lying? There’s something you’re not telling me.”</p><p>Agatha toyed with her own salted caramel ice cream, her appetite for it waning in the midst of Wanda’s scrutiny. “Not here, okay? Not in front of the boys.”</p><p>Intrigue sparked through Wanda’s eyes. “Okay. Then I’ll come over tonight, once Nicky’s asleep. Is it a conversation that needs wine?”</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha would need half a bottle alone to get through it.</p><p>“I can do that.”</p><p>True to her word, Wanda showed up with a bottle of Merlot at ten p.m., long after Agatha had tucked an exhausted Nicky in bed. Truthfully, she was glad for the company, even if she was dreading the topic of conversation.</p><p>Ever since she and Nicky had gotten home earlier that day, Agatha had been able to think of nothing but Rio. She was a constant in Agatha’s mind, in her thoughts—she had been <em>anyway</em>, but to know there was a chance she could see Rio at any of Nicky’s practices, at all of his games…</p><p>Well, that was maddening.</p><p>“Okay, spill.” Wanda at least waited until she’d poured two glasses of wine before she opened her mouth. “What’s the deal with you and Vidal?”</p><p>They sat at Agatha’s kitchen counter, and Agatha took a long sip of her wine before she answered. “So, do you remember when I told you I didn’t call the number I found in Ralph’s phone records?”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes bulged. “It was <em>her</em>?!”</p><p>“No.” Agatha didn’t want Wanda to think badly of Rio, not when her sons were on the team, too. “But she did answer the phone.” Agatha shifted in her seat. “It turns out that Ralph wasn’t cheating on me in the traditional sense. He, um, he was hiring a dominatrix.”</p><p>She snuck a glance at Wanda, and was unsurprised to see her mouth agape, glass of wine halfway to her lips.</p><p>“Yeah. It wasn’t Rio, but it was someone else she works with.”</p><p>“Rio, huh?” Wanda recovered enough to notice Agatha’s slip, and took a hefty gulp of her own wine. “So, she’s one too?”</p><p>“When she’s not coaching the soccer team…yes.”</p><p>“Holy shit.”</p><p>“You can’t tell anyone,” Agatha said. “She doesn’t want to lose her job, and I promised.”</p><p>“I won’t. Not even Vision.” Wanda shook her head. “I think I just need a minute to process this. I’ve been wondering all afternoon what you were going to tell me, and this… I never would’ve guessed this.”</p><p>“What <em>had </em>you guessed?”</p><p>“I don’t know. Maybe she was a former student of yours, or and old friend? Not… a dominatrix who works with the person Ralph cheated on you with.”</p><p>Agatha snorted her next mouthful of wine. “Well, when you put it like that it does sound ridiculous, doesn’t it? I can’t believe this is what my life’s become.” She dropped her head onto the cool marble counter, and Wanda patted her back in sympathy.</p><p>“Is that all she had to say to you? To ask you not to tell anyone?”</p><p>“Pretty much.” Agatha did <em>not </em>want to get into Rio flirting with her. Wanda had no idea about her sexuality—how could she, when Agatha had barely even acknowledged it to herself?—and she didn’t know what she’d say if she knew.</p><p>“How are you going to cope with seeing her? I know it wasn’t her who was with Ralph, but still. It’s a reminder.”</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “It’s okay. Like you said, it’s not like it was her. And I know you don’t believe me, but I really <em>am </em>good when it comes to all things Ralph. I meant it when I said we haven’t been happy for a long time. I’m over him because it’s been a long time since I was in love with him.”</p><p>“I had no idea you felt that way, Agatha. Why didn’t you ever say anything?”</p><p>“Honestly? I’d settled for it.” She stared at the depths of her glass like it might hold the answers she was looking for. “Got complacent. Told myself I didn’t need more than what I had. And you and Vision are so happy, that I… I don’t know. I guess I didn’t want to complain? That it was easier to just pretend everything was fine, even though I honestly don’t know if it ever was?”</p><p>Wanda drew in a sharp breath. “Do you regret getting married at all?”</p><p>She bit at her bottom lip. “No. Because it brought me Nicky, and I wouldn’t change him for the world. Sometimes I just wish that I hadn’t let myself get pushed into it. If I could go back… I don’t know. I don’t know if I’d do things differently. I do wish I could’ve been strong enough to end it sooner, though.”</p><p>“Well, you’re free now,” Wanda said, rubbing the small of Agatha’s back. “And when you feel like you’re ready to put yourself back out there, I’ll be with you every step of the way. We’ll find you your Prince Charming.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth twisted before she could stop it.</p><p>And of course Wanda noticed. “I don’t mean right away! It’s totally fine if you don’t feel ready yet. But I <em>do </em>know all of the best dating apps to use these days, thanks to the girls at work. I swear it’s all they talk about.”</p><p>“It… it’s not that.” Agatha refused to look Wanda in the eye, stared at the dregs of wine at the bottom of her glass. “What if…” She took a deep breath. But if she couldn’t tell Wanda, then how was she ever going to live her life truthfully, the way she’d always wanted? “What if it was a Princess Charming, instead?”</p><p>“Oh.” Wanda didn’t pull back, her hand staying on Agatha’s back, rubbing the same soothing circles. And when Agatha’s gaze darted to Wanda’s, she found an encouraging smile looking back at her. “We can find you one of those, too.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Yeah, Agatha. If that’s what you want.”</p><p>“I think it is.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>And just like that, Agatha had admitted it out loud.</p><p>Just like that, it was out in the world, couldn’t be taken back, and… nothing terrible had happened. Wanda hadn’t recoiled, or looked at her disgust.</p><p>Only with love.</p><p>Blinking back tears, Agatha poured them both another glass, and let Wanda skilfully turn the conversation to lighter topics, more grateful than she could ever put into words.</p>

<p>“Remember,” Agatha called as the sound of twenty-two students packing up their belongings echoed around the room, “your essays on the Salem witch trials are due end of Friday!”</p><p>A few grunts were all the answer Agatha received, and she let them go on their way before shoving her own laptop into her bag. She had a precious two hours before her next class, and she needed a black coffee and a muffin from her favorite campus coffee shop if she was going to make it through the rest of the day.</p><p>She hadn’t been sleeping well the past few nights. She was sure it was the thought of the impending weekend without Nicky. Aside from the occasional sleepover, Agatha had never spent a night without him. And now she was staring at two nights and two days of silence in the house on her own, and she didn’t know how she was going to survive it.</p><p>Not that she was being dramatic, or anything.</p><p>Agatha hoisted her laptop bag over her shoulder and spilled out into the hall along with the rest of the student body moving to their next lecture.</p><p>Thanks to some long-awaited renovations to the history building, Agatha’s department had been displaced to the other side of campus for half the year, and it took her a moment to get her bearings once she stepped outside.</p><p>The science building stood opposite, which meant she needed to take a left—only as she made her way down the steps, she caught a glimpse of dark hair and an all-too-familiar tattoo that made Agatha stop in her tracks.</p><p>Surely not.</p><p>Surely she was seeing things.</p><p>Rio still featured in her dreams—and her fantasies, when sleep would not come easy—and now she was projecting.</p><p>Right?</p><p>Except as Agatha watched the woman turning down the path in-front of her, smiling down at the phone in her hand, Agatha knew her eyes weren’t making things up. Because that was, without question, Rio Vidal, on Westview college campus.</p><p>Haunting Agatha’s work life, as well as her home life.</p><p>The smart thing to do would be to ignore it. Ignore Rio, turn and go to <em>Espresso Yourself</em> for her much-needed caffeine and chocolate boost, and pretend it had never happened. After all, she’d never noticed Rio on campus before.</p><p>(Agatha knew it was possible that she <em>had</em>. While Rio was striking, could turn anyone’s head, Agatha had gotten so good at <em>not </em>noticing other women over the years that it was entirely possible their paths had crossed before.)</p><p>But, when it came to Rio, Agatha was apparently not good at making smart choices.</p><p>So, instead of taking a left, she went right, and caught up with Rio in a few long strides. “First you show up as my kid’s soccer coach,” Agatha said, making Rio glance up from her phone—the pleased smile that crossed her lips made Agatha’s stomach swoop. “And now you turn up at my place of work? Are you stalking me, Ms. Vidal?”</p><p>“A happy coincidence.” Rio turned to face her, sliding her phone into the back pocket of her ridiculously tight black jeans. “You’re a professor here? What department?”</p><p>“Why? Want to take one of my classes?” Agatha raised an eyebrow, unsure why Rio managed to bring this side out of her—flirtatious and carefree. It was exhilarating. She wanted <em>more</em>.</p><p>Rio’s gaze took in Agatha’s fitted black slacks, white button-down shirt, and black blazer. “I’m not sure that’s a good idea. I wouldn’t know what to do with myself if I had a professor as gorgeous as you.”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip, fighting the blush she felt threatening to bloom on her cheeks.</p><p>“But seriously, what department? Because I know I haven’t seen you around here before. I’d have remembered you.”</p><p>“Why don’t you guess?”</p><p>“Hmm.” A tiny crease formed between Rio’s eyebrows as she tilted her head, considering. “Well, it’s definitely not <em>my </em>department. You looked like you came out of the mathematics building, but I don’t think you’re stuffy enough for that. You give me Arts vibes, so… English faculty?”</p><p>“Wrong. History.”</p><p>Rio waved a hand. “Close enough.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “We’ll have to agree to disagree about that. You said <em>your </em>department—don’t tell me you work here, too? How many jobs do you have?”</p><p>Rio laughed, hooking her fingers through the beltloops of her jeans. “I’m in grad school, working toward my doctorate. Hence my… extra circular activities. It’s not cheap.”</p><p>“No, it’s not.” So, Rio was a fellow academic. Struggling to put herself through school, working odd jobs to make ends meet. Just… whereas Agatha had worked retail and as a barista, Rio was coaching kids soccer and punishing women. “Must be hard to balance.”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “It’s not always easy, but most of my clients know when I’m available. And I can have a pretty flexible schedule here—my advisor’s a night owl, so he doesn’t care when I get my work done, so long as I do it.”</p><p>“Which department?”</p><p>Brown eyes sparkled back at Agatha. “You don’t want to guess?”</p><p>Much like Rio had studied her, Agatha allowed herself a moment to return the favor. She took in Rio’s sinfully tight jeans, white halter neck shirt, and combat boots. The boots were practical, but not seasonal—it was warm outside, and most other students wore sandals or pumps. Agatha glanced at the science building at Rio’s back—combat boots were the type of shoes someone might wear if they worked in a lab all day.</p><p>Plus, the tattoo on Rio’s shoulder of the winding vines, and the plants in her yard that had bloomed bright, certainly carefully cared for. “Biology,” Agatha said, injecting her voice with as much confidence as she could muster. “Something to do with plants?”</p><p>A pleased look flashed across Rio’s face “Very good, Agatha.”</p><p>Okay. There was no reason that that look on her face, coupled with the husky tone of her voice as she said those words, should make Agatha’s knees tremble. That was definitely going to feature in her dreams tonight. <em>Fuck</em>. “How many years do you have left?”</p><p>“Just the one, hopefully.”</p><p>Agatha could survive a year of them being on the same campus, right? If she’d never knowingly run into Rio in the last however many years she’d been at Westview, what were the chances their paths would cross too many times in twelve months? Slim, surely. And aside from games, soccer was easy for her to avoid thanks to Wanda and Vision. “And then?”</p><p>“Wondering if you’re still going to be running into me on campus?” A smirk pulled at Rio’s lips. “I don’t know. I’ve thought about teaching, but I don’t know if I’m cut out for it.”</p><p>“Why not? You don’t enjoy it? Isn’t it just another form of telling people what to do?”</p><p>Rio hummed under her breath, a spark of something dangerous in her eyes. “I suppose. Is that why you like it?” A sculpted eyebrow arched, her smirk widening. “The power?”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, wondering how every conversation with Rio managed to turn into something charged. They were in public, for fucks sake. Where anyone could overhear them. One of her students could be mere feet away, able to hear every word they were saying. Or worse—one of her colleagues. Agatha knew she wasn’t the only one who had been relegated to teaching out of the mathematics building. “We’re not talking about me.”</p><p>“But what if I want to?” Rio stepped an inch closer, and Agatha stepped back. “You’re a fascinating woman, Agatha. And I have to admit, I’m a little disappointed I haven’t seen you since the game. How come you don’t pick Nicky up from practice?”</p><p>“I don’t see how that’s any of your business.”</p><p>“Oh, so you’re allowed to ask me whatever you want, but I can’t return the favor?” Rio’s laugh was soft as she shook her head. “<em>You </em>were the one who came over to me just now, you know.”</p><p>“A mistake, clearly.”</p><p>“Okay, Agatha.” Rio brought up a hand to play with the chain around her neck, and Agatha couldn’t help her eyes flickering to the movement, watching the way Rio’s fingers moved, brushing over her own collarbones. “You keep telling yourself that. And keep telling yourself you don’t want to give me a call, too.”</p><p>Annoyed at the—totally correct insinuation—Agatha straightened her spine. “I <em>don’t</em>.”</p><p>“Sure. You know, your shoulders look a little tight—are you stressed? Because I can help you out with that, if you want.”</p><p>“I’m leaving now.” Spinning on her heel, Agatha began to stalk away.</p><p>“Enjoy the rest of your day!” Rio called to her retreating back, amusement clear in her voice.</p><p>Agatha knew, as she walked through the door of <em>Espresso Yourself </em>and ordered <em>two </em>black coffees, that she’d be thinking about nothing but Rio’s eyes and Rio’s lips and Rio’s stupid, infuriating words for the rest of the goddamn day.</p><p> </p><p align="center">* * *</p><p align="center"> </p><p>On Wednesday afternoon, Agatha was grading papers when her cell rang.</p><p>She didn’t recognize the number on the screen and frowned as she answered it. “Hello?”</p><p>“Hi, Agatha?” Rio’s voice came from the other end of the line, and Agatha nearly dropped the phone in shock. It wasn’t the number Agatha had called, so it must have been her personal cell, instead. “There’s, um, been a bit of an accident at soccer practice.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart fell to her stomach. “Is Nicky okay?”</p><p>“He is, but he’s got a bloody nose and he’s feeling very sorry for himself. Are you able to come by and pick him up?”</p><p>She was already getting to her feet. “I can be there in ten minutes.”</p><p>Thanks to a touch of speeding (her boy was hurt—sue her), Agatha made it there in eight. She parked haphazardly and left her hastily packed bag on the passenger seat as she raced over to where the kids were practicing.</p><p>Nicky was easy to spot, sitting cross-legged by the side of the field with an ice pack held to his face. Rio was sat beside him, a hand on the small of his back as she called instructions to the other boys still practicing on the grass.</p><p>“Are you okay, sweetheart?” Agatha dropped onto her knees on the grass beside him, aghast when she saw the state of his shirt—the bloodstains showed up vividly against the white.</p><p>Who thought <em>white </em>was a good color for a soccer training kit, anyway?</p><p>“I’m fine, mom.”</p><p>“Let me see your nose.” Gently, Agatha lifted the ice pack away from his face, sucking in a breath when she saw the damage beneath. His nose was already bruised, but it didn’t look broken, and the bleeding had stopped, at least. She turned her attention to Rio. “What the hell happened?”</p><p>She couldn’t keep the accusatory note from her voice. Logically, she knew soccer was a contact sport, and accidents happened, but they were ten years old—how much damage should they be doing to one another?</p><p>“An accident,” Rio said, her voice soft, and a crease of concern between her eyebrows as she glanced at Nicky’s face. “He got elbowed. But the good news is, it doesn’t seem broken. He’ll just have a wicked bruise. But if it swells overnight you should take him to see a doctor.”</p><p>“Is medical professional one of your many occupations?” Agatha snapped. She knew she shouldn’t lash out, knew Rio couldn’t have done anything to prevent this from happening, but she couldn’t help it. She still felt frayed on the edges from panic that something awful had happened to her son.</p><p>“No.” Rio pushed herself to her feet, annoyance crossing her features. “But I am first aid trained. You can take that ice pack home with you, Nicky. Just bring it back next time. And you should probably skip Friday’s session—give yourself the weekend to heal up, and I’ll see you on Monday.”</p><p>Before Nicky had the chance to argue, Rio stepped away, toward the other kids.</p><p>Blue eyes, a mirror of her own, glared up at Agatha. “It wasn’t her fault, Mom, it was mine. I wasn’t looking where I was going, and I ran into Billy’s elbow.”</p><p>Agatha smoothed down his hair. “You need to be more careful, sweetheart.”</p><p>“I know. I’m sorry.”</p><p>She kissed the top of his head, some of her worry easing the longer she held him in her arms, able to feel the warmth of his skin and the strong beating of his heart.</p><p>“You should say sorry, too,” Nicky said. “To Coach Vidal. She looked after me ‘til you got here and she kept me calm even when there was blood everywhere and you know I don’t like blood. You were mean to her.”</p><p>Agatha winced, knowing he was right. But the thought of approaching Rio and apologizing—admitting she had been wrong—was a hard pill for Agatha to swallow. Still, she was supposed to be setting a good example for her son, who was staring at her expectantly, so Agatha sighed and stood so she could approach Rio’s back.</p><p>She wore the same sweatpants and hoodie combination she’d been wearing at the game, and Agatha had to force herself not to admire the way the sweatpants hung low on her hips, a sliver of skin threatening to show between the waistband and the hem of her hoodie.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“It’s Coach Vidal here,” Rio said, without turning to look at her. The words were clipped, and it was clear from the set of her jaw (and <em>god</em>, that jawline could cut glass, and Agatha should absolutely not be paying attention to that right now—<em>why </em>did being around Rio turn her into a horny mess?) that she was annoyed.</p><p>“Okay.” Agatha inched closer, leaning close to murmur in Rio’s ear. “<em>Coach Vidal</em>.”</p><p>A shiver ran down Rio’s spine—Agatha was close enough to feel it—but other than that, she didn’t react. Her jaw didn’t unclench.</p><p>“Look, I’m sorry, okay? I know that what happened wasn’t your fault. And… thank you for looking after him. Nicky said you kept him calm.”</p><p>Finally, Rio cracked—just enough to turn her cheek slightly to glance at Agatha over her shoulder. “You don’t have to sound so surprised. I wasn’t going to leave him there bleeding.”</p><p>“No, but I know how hysterical he can get when he’s hurt. He scraped his knee once falling off his skateboard and he nearly fainted from just a few spots of blood.”</p><p>“He did look a little woozy for a sec,” Rio admitted. “But I think I managed to distract him. He was telling me all about his rabbit. Senor Scratchy, right? He loves that thing.”</p><p>“That fucking rabbit.” Agatha shook her head. “Did he tell you that his father brought it home without asking me?”</p><p>“No. But knowing what I do know about your husband, that tracks.”</p><p>“Ex-husband. I filed for divorce the day after I met you.”</p><p>“I’d say I’m sorry, but something tells me you’re not.”</p><p>“Absolutely not.” Agatha slid her hands into the pockets of her jacket. “Does he… has Nicky not talked about it? The divorce?”</p><p>At that, Rio turned to face her fully—though she still kept one eye on the chattering children racing around on the field in front of them. “Not to me. But I don’t exactly have hearts-to-hearts with all the kids. Soccer is about leaving everything else behind, just focusing on the game—it gives them a distraction from whatever else is going on in their lives. Not to say I wouldn’t be there if they needed someone to listen,” Rio hastened to add, “but it’s not what these sessions are for.”</p><p>“I just worry, sometimes, about the affect it’ll have on him.”</p><p>“Well, if it’s any consolation, I haven’t noticed any big changes in him since it happened.”</p><p>“This weekend is the first time he’s going to be at his dad’s.” The words sprung from Agatha’s mouth without her brain’s permission—because if she <em>had </em>been thinking, she sure as hell wouldn’t be spilling her guts to Rio on the side of a soccer field close to sixteen ten-year-olds.</p><p>“Oh.” Rio rocked back on her heels, corners of her eyes scrunching as she frowned. “And how are you feeling about that?”</p><p>“Um. Awful.”</p><p>“I’m sorry.” Rio held her gaze, and the intensity took Agatha’s breath away. “It must be difficult.”</p><p>“Yeah. It is.” Agatha buried her own hands in the pockets of her jacket, desperate to change the subject. “What you said before, about soccer being an escape—are you speaking from personal experience? Did you used to play?”</p><p>“I did, yeah. In college. I wasn’t scholarship good, or anything, but I was good enough to be on the team. I loved it.” A wistful look crossed Rio’s face. “And then I tore my ACL my junior year, and I couldn’t afford the surgery that would get me back playing, so.” She shrugged. “I had to stop.”</p><p>“I’m sorry to hear that.” Surrounding herself by eager ten-year-olds full of potential couldn’t be the easiest thing in the world.</p><p>“Everything happens for a reason, right? At least doing this, I still get to keep soccer in my life. Plus, kids this young are super impressed I have any skill at all.”</p><p>“Is that why—”</p><p>“Look out!” A shout cut Agatha off before she could finish her sentence, and she turned to see a soccer ball hurtling toward her.</p><p>Before she could react, Rio grabbed Agatha’s wrist and jerked her backwards, shielding her from the onrushing ball with her own body. Agatha watched as Rio stopped the ball using her upper chest. It bounced to her feet, and she trapped it beneath the sole of her white sneakers.</p><p>“Watch it, Carter,” Rio said, a note of warning in her voice as she glanced toward the sheepish-looking boy standing a few feet away.</p><p>“Sorry, Coach! I didn’t mean to.”</p><p>“Then don’t do it again.” Rio kicked the ball back to him, and as Carter skipped away with it at his feet, Agatha found herself struggling to concentrate on anything other than the hand still wrapped around her wrist.</p><p>Not to mention Rio’s soccer prowess.</p><p>Agatha had never found it especially interesting—let alone impressive—but Rio’s effortless display had made her a little hot under the collar.</p><p>But not as hot under the collar as the fingers pressed against her skin. The touch burned, and Agatha really hoped Rio couldn’t feel the frantic throb of her pulse in her wrist. Maybe she could blame it on adrenaline—she <em>had </em>nearly been clocked in the face by a ball, after all.</p><p>“You okay?” Rio squeezed her wrist, gently, and—<em>mortifyingly</em>—it wrenched a gasp from Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>She was blaming it on the fact that she hadn’t been touched by anyone other than Nicky or Wanda or (shudder) Ralph in…</p><p>Agatha didn’t even want to quantify that with a number.</p><p><em>That </em>was the only reason why her heart was racing. Because she was touch-starved. It had nothing to do with Rio at all. “Y-yeah.” Agatha cleared her throat, and pulled herself free from Rio’s grip. “I, um, had better get going. Thanks again for looking out for Nicky. And for saving me from having a matching bruise.”</p><p>“No problem at all.” Rio buried her hands into the pockets of her sweatpants as Agatha edged back toward Nicky. “I hope you feel better soon, kid!”</p><p>“Thanks, Coach!”</p><p>Agatha helped him to his feet, ice pack still held to his nose, and steered him toward that car, resolutely refusing to think about how soft Rio’s skin had felt against her own.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha woke up on Saturday morning with a killer headache.</p><p>Light streamed in through the closed blinds of her bedroom, and she pulled the sheets over her head to block it out as she groped for her phone. At least Nicky being with Ralph had one positive—she didn’t need to get out of bed for anything in particular, and she could lie there all day and do nothing but think about her terrible choices all day if she wanted.</p><p>When she finally located her phone, two more missed calls from her mother (Agatha had been dodging them ever since separating from Ralph, not wanting to hear about how she’d failed as a wife) and three message notifications waited for her.</p><p>The first was from Wanda, cursing Agatha’s name. But it was <em>her </em>fault she’d decided to come over to keep Agatha company last night, worried about her being alone for the first time. Agatha hadn’t <em>forced </em>Wanda to help her drink two bottles of wine.</p><p>Wanda had chosen that fate for herself.</p><p>And at least she had Vision to help her take care of the boys. Agatha had it on good authority that he was taking them to a baseball game for the afternoon, so Wanda would have plenty of time to recover.</p><p>The other two messages were both from the same number.</p><p>One that wasn’t saved in her phone.</p><p>The first message read: <em>I don’t know if this is appropriate or not, but I just wanted to check if you were okay. I know your first weekend without Nicky can’t be easy. And I hope his nose is feeling better. </em></p><p>And the second: <em>This is Rio, by the way. </em></p><p>As if Agatha needed to be told. She recognized the number that had called to tell her Nicky was hurt, and Rio was the only one, other than Wanda, who knew about her fears for the weekend.</p><p>The message was unsolicited, their first contact since Agatha had left with Nicky on Wednesday. Agatha’s heart pounded in time with her head as she read and then re-read the message. Why had Rio reached out?</p><p>The fact that Rio might be thinking of Agatha, the way Agatha sometimes thought of Rio was…</p><p>Well.</p><p>Maddening. Terrifying. Exhilarating.</p><p>It was a good thing Rio hadn’t sent those messages last night. Who knew what Agatha might have said if she’d texted Rio drunk?</p><p>Nothing good.</p><p>And how the hell was she supposed to reply? She knew what she <em>should </em>do. She should shut it down. Make sure Rio never reached out to her again, because it was already hard <em>enough</em> without this. Without Rio being a mere text message away.</p><p>It had been hard enough to ignore her phone number, burning a hole in Agatha’s pocket. A call was harder to initiate—a more conscious choice than a flirty text.</p><p>But with this…</p><p>Danger.</p><p>And most dangerous of all? Agatha hadn’t even been the one to start it. Which <em>must </em>mean that Rio was affected by her, too. More than just a harmless flirtation whenever their paths crossed.</p><p>She emerged from her cocoon of sheets with a huff, the message thread with Rio still open on her screen.</p><p>With her bottom lip ensnared between her teeth, Agatha began to type.</p><p><em>It is inappropriate. </em>A solid start. As Agatha debated what to say next, she sneezed—and swore when the jerk of her body made her thumb press send.</p><p>“No, no, no, no,” Agatha said, when it came up saying that the message had been read, and a set of dots appeared at the bottom of the screen.</p><p><em>I sent that too soon</em>, she typed hastily. This time, when she pressed send, she meant it.</p><p>The dots stopped typing.</p><p>Waiting for Agatha to continue.</p><p>
<em>What I should have said was: It is inappropriate, but thank you for checking in with me. I’m doing okay. And Nicky’s nose is fine—it didn’t swell too badly, and the bruising is already going down. He’ll be back on Monday. </em>
</p><p>Rio’s response was quick—and simple. <em>Glad to hear it. </em></p><p>Was that it? Agatha stared at her screen, willing more dots to appear. But there was nothing. Had Rio really reached out, completely thrown her for a loop, just to say that? To make her head spin, to leave her second-guessing, all for a <em>glad to hear it</em>?</p><p>Well, Agatha wasn’t going to stand for that.</p><p>
<em>Did you really steal my number from Nicky’s emergency contact information just to check up on me?</em>
</p><p>
<em>…Maybe. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Why? </em>
</p><p>The dots appeared, then disappeared, over and over again. It sent a thrill down her spine, because Rio always came off as so confident, so sure of herself, where Agatha felt like she was always on the back foot.</p><p>
<em>I don’t know. I meant it when I called you fascinating. You make me want to do things I never usually would. </em>
</p><p>Agatha swallowed, heat rising to her cheeks. Her wine-induced headache was all but forgotten, chased away by the adrenalin Rio’s texts sent flooding through her body. <em>Like what? </em></p><p>
<em>Where would you like me to begin? </em>
</p><p>Agatha felt like she was walking a fine line. Balancing on a tightrope, dangerously close to tipping over the edge and into shark-infested waters.</p><p>But a part of her <em>wanted </em>to feel that sting. Wanted to see how far Rio would take this—and what she would do if Agatha matched her energy.</p><p>
<em>Wherever you like. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Well, you’re the first parent I’ve ever texted, for a start. The first one I’ve ever wanted to. Also the first person who hasn’t called me when I’ve told them they could… I’m not used to that. People don’t usually turn me down. </em>
</p><p>Agatha could believe that. If only Rio knew how close she’d come to caving, hovering over her number in her cell, wishing she could be a little braver.</p><p>Another message: <em>It’s refreshing, but it only makes me want it more.</em></p><p>The thump thump of Agatha’s heartbeat was loud in her ears as she stared at the words on her screen. She didn’t know what to say.</p><p>She knew what she <em>wanted </em>to say (<em>I want it, too</em>), but her fingers stalled, refusing to type the words. The dots appeared again, followed by:</p><p>
<em>If you want me to stop, just tell me. </em>
</p><p>Stopping was the last thing Agatha wanted Rio to do. She hadn’t felt this alive—despite the headache, despite the hangover, despite her exhaustion—in years. The knowledge that Rio <em>wanted </em>her, that she wasn’t just flirting for the sake of it, or for a bit of fun—the fact that someone as stunning as Rio could want her in any way was electric.</p><p>Before Agatha could type a frantic <em>no please don’t stop, I don’t ever want you to stop </em>a heavy knock sounded on her front door.</p><p>The noise jolted her, phone flying out of her hand and onto her bed, because she wasn’t expecting company. She had no deliveries scheduled, and Ralph wouldn’t be stupid enough to bring Nicky back early without warning her. Wanda was the only one who might come over without a courtesy text first, but Agatha was certain she would still be in bed nursing her own sore head.</p><p>Another knock, so hard Agatha could hear the door rattle even from her bedroom.</p><p>And then a voice that made her blood run cold.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness! Open this door right <em>now</em>! I can see your car out front—I know you’re home!”</p><p>Her mother. What the <em>fuck </em>was she doing here? Panicked, Agatha scrambled to her feet as the knocking continued and hastily pulled on a robe before racing down the stairs. She should have probably looked in a mirror, but she knew what would stare back at her—messy hair, reddened cheeks, and the heavy bags under her eyes that never seemed to lessen, no matter how much sleep she had.</p><p>All things her mother would no doubt comment on the second she laid eyes on Agatha’s face, but if Agatha had taken the time to make herself presentable and left her mother outside for another second…</p><p>That would be even more unacceptable.</p><p>Agatha wrenched open her front door, half-hoping that she’d imagined her mother’s voice, but no. For on her stoop, in all of her terrible glory, stood the one and only Evanora Harkness herself. And of course she looked immaculate, despite the four hour flight that she must have caught to darken Agatha’s door.</p><p>“You look terrible.”</p><p>“Gee, thanks, Mom, it’s nice to see you too.”</p><p>Evanora grunted and brushed past Agatha to cast her critical gaze around her home. Which, okay, it wasn’t perfectly clean and tidy—she had a messy ten-year-old for fucks sake—but it wasn’t exactly a trash heap. But it wasn’t up to Evanora’s standards. “Bit of a mess in here, isn’t it? Though not as bad as your appearance. Divorce doesn’t look good on you, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, let out a deep breath, and counted to ten before she answered. “I wasn’t expecting company, mother.”</p><p>“Did you just get out of bed? It’s eleven thirty.”</p><p>“And I had a late night.”</p><p>Evanora’s gaze flitted over to the kitchen island, and the two empty bottles of wine sitting on it. “Yes, I can see that.”</p><p>“So, what, I’m not allowed to enjoy myself?” Agatha folded her arms across her chest, her headache returning full force now that she was faced with her worst nightmare. “Nicky’s with Ralph for the weekend, and I wanted a drink. Sue me.”</p><p>Based on the way Evanora’s lips pressed together tightly, mentioning Nicky hadn’t been the wisest move. “Ah, yes. So, you broke up your family so you could down two bottles of cheap Merlot on a Friday night alone?”</p><p>“I wasn’t alone.” Probably not what Agatha should have focused on first. “And that’s not why I’m divorcing Ralph. What a minute—how do you even know about the divorce?” Agatha sure as hell hadn’t told her. She’d been hoping to stall it for as long as she could. Preferably until it had been finalized.</p><p>“Well, when you wouldn’t take my calls, I thought something must be wrong, so I reached out to Ralph. He told me everything.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “I’m certain he did not tell you <em>everything</em>.”</p><p>“He said he made a mistake, but that you hadn’t given him the chance to apologize for it.”</p><p>Unable to cope with this while she was standing—it felt like a knife was stabbing into the side of her skull—Agatha slid onto the couch and pressed her fingers to her temples. “A mistake? Did he tell you what he’d been doing?”</p><p>Evanora waved a hand, remaining on her feet—so that she could look down on Agatha with disdain. “The specifics don’t matter. I can read between the lines, it’s clear he betrayed you in some way. But we all battle with temptation, Agatha. You know that better than most, don’t you?”</p><p>Agatha’s head snapped up, her lip lifting in a snarl. Maybe a few weeks ago—still shackled to her husband and her mother’s image of a perfect life—Agatha would have shrank back, instead. Would have accepted whatever hand her mother dealt to her, like she always had.</p><p>But Agatha had changed, the day she’d divorced Ralph.</p><p>(The day she’d met Rio.)</p><p>She didn’t want to hide any more. Didn’t want to cower behind the shadow of Evanora Harkness, terrified of the consequences of disobeying her.</p><p>For her whole life, all Agatha had wanted was to be loved.</p><p>By the father who had walked out when she was a baby and never looked back. By the mother who had blamed Agatha for him leaving, using it as an excuse to berate her for every mistake, for every time she had not been perfect. By the husband who had never been someone she’d really wanted.</p><p>But she would no longer bend and break herself to fit into the mold of what other people wanted her to be.</p><p>If they could not accept her as she was, unquestionably, then Agatha was no longer interested in knowing them.</p><p>“I never strayed in my marriage,” Agatha said, her voice quiet and deadly. “No matter how <em>tempted </em>I may have been. He couldn’t offer me the same decency.”</p><p>“Perhaps not. But if I can forgive you for your past sins, I’m sure you can forgive your husband for his.”</p><p>“My <em>past sins</em>?” Agatha’s voice was raised, too loud, strained with the weight of all the things that, until now, she’d been too afraid to say. “You mean for daring to fall in love with another wom—”</p><p>The backhanded slap shouldn’t have been unexpected—it was not the first time her mother had struck her—but Agatha wasn’t prepared for it. The skin of her cheek stung, and her mother’s diamond ring split the skin of her bottom lip clean open, warm blood trickling down Agatha’s chin.</p><p>“Look what you made me do,” Evanora said, like Agatha had <em>forced </em>her to raise her hand. “Agatha, you’re forty-two. Past your prime. Do you really want to spend the rest of your life alone?”</p><p>Wiping at her wounded lip with the back of her hand, Agatha glared up at her mother. “Like you are, you mean?”</p><p>“So ungrateful. After all I’ve done for you.”</p><p>“You have done <em>nothing </em>for me.” Agatha pushed herself to her feet, and wrapped her hand around her mother’s wrist to drag her toward the door.</p><p>Evanora was so shocked—Agatha had never stood up to her before—that she let her.</p><p>“Nothing other than force me to try and be your perfect daughter, but no matter what I did, it was never good enough. And yes, I’d rather be alone and happy than stuck in a marriage to a man I don’t love, hiding what I truly want. I might be forty-two, but I am far from past my prime—I feel <em>free </em>for the first time in my life. And I’m sick and tired of trying to conform for you.” Agatha yanked open the door and shoved Evanora over the threshold. “So, thanks for the visit, mother, but you’re not going to change my mind. And until you can accept me for who I am—who you <em>know</em>, deep down, I really am—then I don’t want to see you again.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest heaved, her heart beating a staccato rhythm as Evanora stared up at her in disbelief.</p><p>“Clearly, you’re still drunk,” Evanora said, eventually, as she brushed the sleeve of her coat, rumpled from Agatha’s grip. “Not in your right mind. When you’ve come to your senses, we can talk again. I didn’t fly all the way out here for you to dismiss me. Not until you’ve realized what a grave mistake you’re making with Ralph.”</p><p>“All the way out here—it’s four hours.” Agatha shook her head. “And I’ve never been in a better frame of mind, actually. I’m sorry you wasted a flight coming over here to see me, but you’re not going to change your mind. And I meant what I said—I don’t want to see you until you can accept me. All of me. Which I’m fully aware you’re not likely to ever do, so—goodbye, mother. Have a nice life.”</p><p>Agatha shut the door before she could lose her nerve, slamming it in Evanora’s face, and sliding the deadbolt home for true dramatic effect.</p><p>And then she rested her back against it, her knees trembling, and sank to the floor, letting the tears fall.</p><p>Not because she regretted what she’d said. She <em>did </em>feel free—no more so than when she heard the sound of an engine start up outside, and her mother’s rental car drive away. But she was overwhelmed.</p><p>By finally standing up for herself. By finally being brave enough to say all of the things that had been building in her chest since she was a teenager to the woman that loved nothing more than to make Agatha’s life a living hell.</p><p>Agatha sat there for a long time before she pushed herself to her feet. Her eyes felt raw and dry from all of the tears, her throat sore, nose stuffy, and while her lip had stopped bleeding it was throbbing in time with the pounding of her head.</p><p>She needed to clean herself up, needed to relax. A hot bath sounded heavenly. So she dragged herself back upstairs, and froze when she saw her discarded phone sitting on the bed, remembering the conversation she and Rio had been having before her morning was so rudely interrupted.</p><p>Another three notifications waited for her. The first had been sent not long after Rio’s last message.</p><p>
<em>That was too much, wasn’t it? </em>
</p><p>The second thirty minutes later. <em>Fuck, Agatha, I’m sorry. I swear I’m not usually like this. It’s clear I’ve read the signals all wrong… please forgive me? </em></p><p>And the final one had been sent just a few minutes ago. <em>You don’t have to, though. The silence speaks for itself. I’m sorry, Agatha—I’ll stop. You won’t hear from me again. </em></p><p>Agatha read them all, and though it was wrong, she couldn’t help but smile. Rio appeared so confident, but she’d revealed her hand in the way the messages sounded progressively more panicked—she was just as affected.</p><p>Well, Agatha <em>had </em>been looking for a way to relax… and she <em>was </em>on a rather daring streak… with no plans for the rest of the day…</p><p>Before she could talk herself out of it, Agatha called Rio’s number.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>The relief was palpable in her voice, wrapping around Agatha’s shoulders like a warm embrace. She sank into it, already feeling herself starting to relax, and said the words that she’d been wanted to say ever since they’d first met.</p><p>“I want to book a session.”</p>

<p>Doubts crept in the second Agatha pulled to a stop outside of Rio’s house.</p><p>Okay, maybe that was a lie—maybe she’d doubted herself the second Rio had told her she could come over that night. Maybe she’d spent over an hour agonizing over what to wear (was it presumptuous to wear nice underwear even though she knew that wasn’t what this was? Would Rio notice that she’d put on her nicest—and tightest—floral blouse? The way her black slacks hugged her curves?).</p><p>Maybe actually getting behind the wheel had made her heart race so fast she’d thought, for a moment, she was having a panic attack.</p><p>But she’d made it.</p><p>And now she sat, like she had four weeks ago (had it really just been four weeks since they’d first met? Since Agatha’s life had turned on its head?), staring at Rio’s front door.</p><p>Only this time, it was dark, the moonlight illuminating the path through Rio’s front yard. And this time, Agatha knew exactly what was awaiting her inside that house.</p><p>She shivered as, just like last time, the front door opened. Light spilled out across the grass, framing Rio like a halo. She wore a dress, dark green, tight to her hips where it floated down to her knees. Panels were cut out of the sides, revealing her ribcage and the toned muscle of her stomach.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth watered at the sight of her.</p><p>She was out of the car without a second thought.</p><p>“You really need to stop loitering outside my home,” Rio said, as Agatha approached, her heels clicking on the paving stones. “What will my neighbors think?”</p><p>What <em>did </em>Rio’s neighbors think about the frequent—and different—visitors to her house? It was a reminder of what, exactly, Agatha had come here to do—and that this was a <em>job </em>to Rio, no matter how flirty her messages. Some of her confidence wavered.</p><p>But then Rio’s eyes flitted across her body, taking her in from head to toe, and the flash of her teeth as she bit down appreciatively on her painted red bottom lip made Agatha take the final two steps forward until she was standing in Rio’s hall.</p><p>“Hi.” It seemed too little, too insufficient, for the things that had led Agatha there, but she didn’t know what else to say.</p><p>How else was she supposed to start this interaction?</p><p>God, what was she <em>doing</em>?</p><p>“Hi.” Rio shut the door behind her with a soft click, eyes running once more over Agatha’s frame—frowning at the set of Agatha’s shoulders. “Are you nervous?”</p><p>“I…” Denial was the first thing that leapt to Agatha’s lips, but if she was going to do this—if they were going to do this, whatever <em>this </em>may turn out to be—Agatha knew she had to be honest. Not just with herself, but with Rio as well. “Yes. I’ve never done anything like this before. I don’t know what to expect.”</p><p>“That’s okay.” Rio’s voice was soft, her eyes, when Agatha dared to meet them, shining with warmth. “We can—” Rio paused, frown returning to her face. “What happened to your lip?”</p><p>“Oh.” Agatha touched her fingers to the swelling—she’d tried her best to hide the cut with lipstick, and the redness of her cheek with concealer, hoping Rio wouldn’t notice. Again, her first instinct was to lie.</p><p>Again, she railed against it. Ducking her head, she stared at the wooden floor, at Rio’s heels and the way they accentuated the muscles of her calves. “I saw my mother today. She slapped me and her ring cut me.”</p><p>A noise left Rio—a mixture of a growl and a sigh—and Agatha’s breath caught when gentle fingers wrapped around her chin and tilted her head up. Rio’s eyes were dark, furious, but her touch, when she brushed her thumb gently—so, so gently—across Agatha’s wounded lip, was soft.</p><p>Cool.</p><p>It took every ounce of Agatha’s willpower not to take that thumb between her lips.</p><p>“She hit you?”</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha could hear her heartbeat in her ears, feel the way her breath trembled when Rio didn’t release her right away. “But it’s not a big deal.”</p><p>Another noise—of disbelief, this time, as Rio’s grip tightened, just a little, on her chin. “Not a big deal? No one should ever raise a hand to you unless you specifically request it.”</p><p>Agatha thought of Rio’s hands on her and shivered. “Well, I threw her out of my house and told her I never wanted to see her again, so. It won’t be happening again.”</p><p>“Good.” Rio finally released her, and Agatha pressed her back against the door, trying to catch her breath.</p><p>If she was this wrecked already, how the hell was she going to survive the rest of the evening?</p><p>“That’s, um, why I didn’t reply to you straight away. Earlier.” Agatha ran a hand through her hair, Rio’s eyes watching the movement closely. “You didn’t do anything wrong. I was just dealing with her.”</p><p>“Is that why you came here tonight?” Rio asked, her head tilted to one side. “Because she got you all wound up?”</p><p>“You <em>did</em> say you could help me out with stress.”</p><p>God, that damn smirk. Agatha wondered what she could do to wipe it away.</p><p>“But that’s not the only reason,” she said, feeling emboldened by being in Rio’s mere presence. “I came because I wanted to. Because I… I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it since I first came here.”</p><p>Well, that wiped the smirk from Rio’s face—it was replaced by a look of intensity, instead. “Hmm, good. And what is it you’ve been thinking about, Agatha? What is it you want?”</p><p><em>You </em>was her first thought, but that didn’t seem wholly appropriate. No matter how attracted she was to Rio—how attracted Rio might be to her in return—that wasn’t what this was about. “I… I don’t know,” she said, and it was honest. She had no idea what she wanted to get from tonight. Rio out of her head? “Aren’t you supposed to be the one in control, here?”</p><p>“Oh, Agatha. That’s not what this is about at all—<em>you’re </em>the one in control, here. You’re the one who tells me what you want. You’re the one who makes the rules, sets the boundaries. I just follow them.” Rio stepped closer—not touching, but close enough for Agatha to feel the heat of her body, to smell the earthly scent of her perfume. “So, tell me—what <em>do </em>you want? First thing that comes to mind.”</p><p>Agatha glanced at Rio’s lips, feeling unmoored—she’d worn heels, but so had Rio, so she was still two inches taller than her. “The first thing that comes to mind isn’t something in your job description.”</p><p>“Try me.”</p><p>“You told me you don’t sleep with your clients,” Agatha said, even though her cheeks were burning. But, Rio had asked—and Agatha was supposed to be being true to herself.</p><p>“Oh.” For the first time, Agatha saw Rio falter. She stepped back, putting some distance between them.</p><p>Agatha felt cold.</p><p>“Is that why you really came here?”</p><p>“No. What I said before, about not being able to stop thinking about it… I should have said I can’t stop thinking about <em>you</em>. Not when you’re everywhere I look. I guess I thought that coming here might help.”</p><p>Rio stared at her for a long moment, brows scrunched together, before she laughed.</p><p>Agatha bristled immediately, one hand already reaching for the door handle—she did <em>not </em>come here to be humiliated. “What’s so funny?”</p><p>Rio noticed her grip on the door handle and stepped close again. “Shit, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to laugh, it’s just… you could’ve just asked me on a date, you know? You didn’t have to hire me, Agatha.”</p><p>“I… oh.” Okay, now she <em>did </em>feel humiliated, but for an entirely different reason. For if there was one thing Agatha Harkness was not, it was stupid. And yet… “I didn’t think of that.”</p><p>“I kinda got that, based on the look on your face.” Rio looked far too amused for Agatha’s liking.</p><p>She peered up at Rio through the curtain of her hair. “You could have asked <em>me </em>on a date.”</p><p>“I didn’t want to presume. Plus, you literally left your husband like, a month ago. Not to mention my job.”</p><p>“Kids soccer coaches <em>are </em>bottom of the dating pool.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes narrowed into a glare. “You know that’s not what I’m talking about. Not many people are lining up to date a dominatrix. It’s not an easy thing to handle—it’s still sex work, even if I’m not fucking any of my clients.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to be so blasé.” Feeling daring, Agatha reached out and settled her hands on Rio’s hips—she ran her thumb across the skin left bare by Rio’s dress, gratified by the way her breath stuttered in response. “But your job isn’t exactly a secret to me. I did hire you.”</p><p>“You did. So you should know my most important rule.” Rio’s hands encircled Agatha’s wrists and pulled them away from her skin—pressing them against the door, instead. “No touching.”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip, smothering a moan at the feel of being pinned down, of the playful look in Rio’s brown eyes. “S-sorry.”</p><p>“I’ll give you a free pass just this once.” Rio didn’t release her grip on Agatha’s wrists, thumbs stroking across her skin, no doubt able to feel the frantic beat of her pulse.</p><p>“Would you… if I <em>had </em>asked you on a date, would you have said yes?”</p><p>“You’ll have to ask me to find out,” Rio said. She released her grip on Agatha and took a step back. “But not tonight. Tonight is about <em>you</em>.”</p><p>“We’re still… are we still doing this?” Agatha had assumed—apparently naively—that her confession had thrown things off.</p><p> “Well, you still look a little stressed, and I did promise I could help you with that.” Rio arched an eyebrow. “Unless you don’t want to?”</p><p>“I… no.”</p><p>“Okay, then.” Rio held out a hand. “Come with me.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated. “I thought you said no touching.”</p><p>“Oh, you’re a quick learner. I like that. It’s fine if I give you permission, and I do, so—come.”</p><p>Agatha slotted her fingers through Rio’s, and allowed herself to be tugged up the stairs, wondering what the hell she was getting herself into.</p><p>On the landing, Rio pulled her toward a door—but paused with her hand against the frame. Without a word, she turned and led Agatha to a different door, further down the hall, instead.</p><p>Inside was a bedroom—but unlike the rest of the house, it was far from impersonal. Plants were scattered over the window ledge, and textbooks were open on the sturdy wooden desk tucked into the corner. The white walls were covered with movie posters—mostly horror—and Agatha spotted a few animal skulls nestled between books on the shelves running along one wall.</p><p>One of the closet doors was open, and Agatha glimpsed pairs of black jeans, a familiar pair of combat boots beneath. The queen-sized bed was made, covered by a dark green bedspread, a thick black blanket nestled at the foot of the bed.</p><p>Rio’s bedroom, clearly—and the fact that it was a little messy, not quite put together, suggested to Agatha she hadn’t been intending for anyone to see the inside of it tonight. “What was in that other room?” Agatha asked, as Rio closed the door behind them, still keeping hold of Agatha’s hand.</p><p>“Another bedroom. It’s where I usually take my clients. Well, that and my basement for the more extreme sessions, but…” Rio trailed off, biting her bottom lip as he eyes roved over Agatha once again.</p><p>“But?”</p><p>“But you’re different,” Rio said. “And I’m hoping this is the only time we do this.”</p><p>“Should I be offended?”</p><p>“No. And you know why not, so don’t be coy with me.” Rio tugged her forward—she settled herself at the end of the bed, and released Agatha’s hand. “Now. Kneel.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed. “I thought we weren’t supposed to be doing that.”</p><p>Agatha wanted to feel Rio’s smirk pressed against her skin.</p><p>“We’re not. And my rule is back in place—no touching. Do you want to know another rule? You’re supposed to listen to me. So. Kneel.”</p><p>The tone of Rio’s voice—soft and sweet but oh so commanding—wrapped around Agatha and all but begged her to comply. So she did, sinking down until Rio’s plush carpet brushed against her bare knees.</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>Okay, <em>fuck</em>, Agatha was not going to make it through the night alive. Because Rio hadn’t even touched her—had said just a handful of words to her—but Agatha wanted to melt. She was wet—could feel it against the lace of her underwear—her clit throbbing when Rio’s eyes met hers.</p><p>She desperately found herself trying to scramble for the upper hand. “I thought I was supposed to tell you what I wanted.”</p><p>“You had your chance to do that.” Rio crossed her left leg over her right—the movement made the skirt of her dress ride up to reveal the black thigh-highs she was wearing, and Agatha bit back a whimper. “You told me you didn’t know. But I can see what you need, Agatha.”</p><p>“And what’s that?”</p><p>“Honestly?”</p><p>“Yes.” <em>Tell me how you see me</em>.</p><p>“Well, there’s a few things.” Rio bent at the waist, leaning in close, her hands wrapped around the bed on either of her hips. “What I think you need—crave—the most is control. You thrive on it. You carefully control every aspect of your life—which is why you’re enjoying this so much right now. Why it feels so good to give it up to someone else. Although deep down, I know you’re thinking about how much more you’d enjoy it if <em>you </em>were in control of <em>me</em>.”</p><p>Agatha could not deny that. The power she’d feel, if she could have Rio on her knees with nothing more than a single glance… it was intoxicating.</p><p>“But I don’t think that’s what you need right now.”</p><p>“No?” Agatha fought not to show how breathless Rio’s mere words had made her. “You don’t think it’d be fun to switch places?”</p><p>“I’ll get on my knees for you one day,” Rio promised, “but you’re in my domain right now, baby. I’m in charge, here.”</p><p>Agatha clenched her teeth so she didn’t show how much she enjoyed the pet name, but it was useless—Rio seemed to notice everything, her eyes sparkling.</p><p>“I think what you need right now…” Rio reached out with one hand, brushing her fingers over Agatha’s cheek before stroking gently through her hair. “Is touch.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fluttered closed, enjoying the sensation far more than she should.</p><p>“When was the last time someone touched you without wanting something from you?”</p><p>“I…” Agatha hesitated, thinking of her mother’s slap, of Ralph’s grabby hands. Even Nicky, lately, only seemed to hug her when he was trying to get her to agree to something. “I don’t know.”</p><p>“Turn around.”</p><p>This time, Agatha didn’t fight the order—she went willingly, and was rewarded by both of Rio’s hands working through her hair. She was gentle, careful not to tug even when her fingers snared on a knot Agatha hadn’t managed to brush out before she left the house.</p><p>And then those fingers danced over the back of Agatha’s neck to work at her shoulders, kneading the muscle.</p><p>She closed her eyes, breathed deep through her nose, and bit back any noises that threatened to escape—because Rio’s hands on her bare skin was magic, stoking a fire in her stomach that only grew with every deliberate drag of her thumb.</p><p>“This is supposed to be relaxing,” Rio murmured, voice close to Agatha’s ear. “But I can feel you tensing up. Stop fighting it.”</p><p>“Easier said than done.”</p><p>“Why? I know I’m good at this. I’ve taken massage classes.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but laugh. “Of course you have.” It <em>felt </em>like she had, because Rio <em>really </em>did seem to know what she was doing with her hands. “I guess this just isn’t how I expected the evening to go.”</p><p>“No? You expected me to, what? Tie you up in my basement and spank you?”</p><p>That image made Agatha choke on air. “Fuck.” She turned her head to glance at Rio over her shoulder—she hadn’t realized how close Rio was leaning, and their cheeks nearly brushed. “Is that still an option?”</p><p>“Eyes forward.” When Agatha was too slow to comply, a hand wound through her hair to gently push her head back to face the door. “And no, that’s not an option. Not for you.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Because I don’t think I could handle seeing you like that and <em>not </em>touch you,” Rio murmured, voice back close to Agatha’s ear. “You know, in eight years, I’ve never crossed a line with a client—never ever even come close—but you…” The hand in her hair tugged, tilting Agatha’s head back to expose her neck, and Agatha felt the warmth of Rio’s breath against the skin there. “You make me want to. You drive me crazy, Agatha.”</p><p>“I bet you say that to all the girls.”</p><p>A chuckle, low and dirty, made Agatha’s toes curl. “I really, really don’t.”</p><p>“Well, if it’s any consolation, the feeling is mutual.”</p><p>Rio released her hold on Agatha’s hair, and shifted her mouth away from her skin. She hadn’t even made contact, but Agatha felt the loss like a physical ache. “I shouldn’t have agreed to this. Shouldn’t have brought you up here. It’s not right.”</p><p>“Please don’t stop,” Agatha said, before Rio could move away from her fully. “Please. It… it feels nice. And I promise I’ll behave myself. You just might have to talk to me so I don’t think about… other things.”</p><p>With a soft sigh, Rio’s hands returned to kneading her shoulders. “What do you want to talk about?”</p><p>“Why did you take massage classes? It can’t have been just for this, right? Surely this isn’t a common way to spend a session.”</p><p>“You’d be surprised.” Rio’s thumbs dug into the back of her shoulder blades, and Agatha arched into it. “It isn’t all leather and spanking. Some people just want to be taken care of. Some of them just want someone to talk to.”</p><p>“Which is your favorite?”</p><p>Rio’s dirty laugh came again, and Agatha was really starting to like the sound of it. “I thought we were supposed to be staying away from dangerous topics?”</p><p>“Forgive me for being curious.”</p><p>“I like both, for different reasons.” Her voice was quiet, open in a way Agatha wasn’t used to hearing. “Either way, you’re becoming what someone needs. Someone they trust. It’s a powerful feeling, but there’s a lot of responsibility that comes with that, too.”</p><p>“And you’ve done this for eight years?”</p><p>“I started when I was twenty.” When Agatha hesitated, Rio’s fingers skimmed down the notches of her spine. “It’s okay. You can ask me whatever you want. Can’t promise I’ll aways answer, though.”</p><p>“That’s so young.” Agatha thought of herself at twenty—unsure of herself, of her place in the world—and could not imagine falling into this lifestyle. “How did you even start?”</p><p>“Well, I saw an ad on Craigslist…” Rio’s smile was clear to hear in her voice. “I’ll tell you my story, but you have to listen to it all—and I don’t want any sympathy from you. You think you can do that?”</p><p>Agatha would try her very best. “Okay.”</p><p>Rio’s hands smoothed along her lower back. “So, I grew up in foster care. My parents died when I was six. Car crash.” The words were perfunctory, practiced, and without much emotion behind them. “I bounced in and around group and foster homes for years, but no one ever wanted me for more than a few months at a time.”</p><p>Agatha drew in a breath, and Rio’s hands pressed harder in warning.</p><p>“That counts as sympathy,” she said, before carrying on. “It wasn’t easy. And when I hit eighteen, they were like… good fucking riddance. Tossed me out. It’s a really great system. My parents left me a trust fund, but I could only access it when I turned twenty-one, so I was broke and homeless. But I had some friends who had been in care too, and they helped me out. One of them was a dancer at a strip club, and she got me a job with her, but I hated it. The money was good, but taking off my clothes… having men leering at me… it wasn’t for me.”</p><p>Eighteen and effectively homeless, forced to work at a strip club just to survive. Agatha forced herself not to react, but a piece of her heart broke for Rio all the same.</p><p>“And then one of the girls at the club started talking about this other job she’d started, working at a BDSM dungeon. The way she described it… I don’t know. It spoke to me, I guess. To have some autonomy. Power over other people. To be in control, for once. I asked her if she could get me an interview, she did, and they hired me on the spot.”</p><p>Rio’s thumbs reached the small of Agatha’s back, kneading until she felt pliant, relaxed despite Rio’s words.</p><p>“I stayed with them for a few years, while I put myself through college. And then I used the trust fund money—sorry mom and dad—to branch out on my own, and become a bit more selective with my clients. I knew I wanted to get my doctorate, and I knew Westview was one of the best places to do that, so I bought this house and I settled down here. It’s close enough to the city that I get enough business.”</p><p>“And you plan to stop when you finish your doctorate?”</p><p>“I think it’d be pretty hard to balance this with a full-time nine-to-five job. Even if it probably would pay better.” Rio’s hands dropped to Agatha’s hips, just holding instead of massaging. “But I’m ready to quit, now. I’ve done it for long enough.”</p><p>“Will you not miss it?”</p><p>“Yes and no. I think I’ll miss the people—I like a lot of my clients, and I like helping them the way that I do—but it’s a lot to deal with. It’s almost like a performance. Sometimes when I get home I just want to curl up in my sweats and watch <em>Love Is Blind</em>—not wrestle myself into a leather catsuit.”</p><p>Agatha snorted, despite the delicious mental image that conjured. “Should I be upset you didn’t wear that for me?”</p><p>“I thought you’d appreciate this look more.”</p><p>“So you dressed up for me?”</p><p>“Yes.” Rio’s hands squeezed her hips once before she pulled away. “I’m afraid our time’s up, Agatha.”</p><p>Disappointment flooded through her body, though Agatha knew it was probably for the best. She couldn’t seem to control herself around Rio. With a wince—she’d been kneeling for a <em>long </em>time—she climbed to her feet and turned.</p><p>Rio had risen too, and Agatha admired the faint flush on her cheeks, glad to see she hadn’t been completely unaffected by their time together.</p><p>Reaching for her bag, Agatha pulled out the envelope containing the amount of money Rio had—somewhat reluctantly—asked for to cover their session and handed it over.</p><p>She tossed it onto the bed behind her. “Thank you.”</p><p>“Not going to check it’s right?”</p><p>“I trust you not to screw me over,” Rio said, with a small shrug. “It wouldn’t be very smart of you, considering I’m going to be seeing you again.”</p><p>“Awfully presumptuous of you.”</p><p>“I was talking about Nicky’s next soccer game.” Rio’s eyes twinkled in the dim lighting. “Why, were you talking about something else?”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks burned, but she refused to look away from Rio’s eyes. “You know I was.”</p><p>“Ask me, then. But—” When Agatha’s mouth opened, Rio was quick to press a finger to her lips, silencing her. “Not now. Not here. Take a breath, make sure you’re okay with everything that happened tonight. Make sure next time you ask me for something, you know what you want. Okay?”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, Rio’s finger still pressed to her lips. “Okay.”</p>

<p>Agatha wanted to disregard Rio’s advice completely, and message her as soon as she arrived back home.</p><p>But she held herself back.</p><p>Because Rio was right—this wasn’t something to rush into. It was something to be certain of, something to cherish, something to savor—something Agatha had waited a very long time for. A shot at being herself, at going after what she really wanted—what she had forced herself to deny for so long.</p><p>So, before Agatha threw caution to the wind, she did what any good historical researcher would do, and she thought things through.</p><p>All of the positives: Rio was beautiful; Agatha was very, very, <em>very </em>attracted to her; Rio was seemingly attracted to her, too; the age gap didn’t seem to be an issue for Rio; Rio already knew about Nicky and her divorce and was seemingly still interested; Rio made her feel more alive than she’d felt in over twenty years.</p><p>All good.</p><p>But then all of the negatives: Agatha <em>was </em>older, settled into her life where Rio was just starting out—what if her career took her away from Westview? What if she <em>wanted </em>to leave Westview, settle down elsewhere in the country?</p><p>Agatha <em>was </em>a mother—Nicky came first, always. What would he make of her dating not only a woman, but his soccer coach? Even if they kept it quiet, it would have to come out eventually. It would affect him. And if he wasn’t okay with it, Agatha didn’t think they’d be able to make it work.</p><p>(And the thought it not working made Agatha ache all over.)</p><p>There was Rio’s job, too—in theory, Agatha was okay with it. She knew she could ask Rio about it, and she would assuage any of her fears, but the practicality of it, of knowing that when Rio couldn’t be with her, she might be with a client, might have her hands on them, even if it would never be sexual for her…</p><p>That would be difficult.</p><p>And then there was the fact that Agatha hadn’t dated a woman since she was a teenager—an ill-fated affair that had ended in tears when they’d been discovered by Evanora Harkness. She hadn’t dated anyone since Ralph, when she was twenty-one—she had no idea what she was doing. Would Rio have the patience for that? For Agatha’s relative inexperience?</p><p>All things for her to think about.</p><p>But there was only ever one outcome.</p><p>Even if it would end badly, Agatha needed to try. She needed to know. She absolutely could not, under any circumstances, let Rio Vidal slip through her fingertips.</p><p>She wouldn’t survive the what-ifs. The not knowing if she’d let something wonderful pass her by.</p><p>Rio was worth any risk.</p><p>Agatha was certain of that most of all.</p><p> </p><p align="center">* * *</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Wanda didn’t question it when Agatha offered to pick the boys up from soccer practice on Monday afternoon.</p><p>Maybe she thought Agatha just wanted to spend more time with Nicky after being without him all weekend (he had, regrettably, had a good time with Ralph, and was excited to go back his grandmother’s in two weeks’ time), or that she wanted to do a good deed to make up for the hangover Agatha had left her with at the weekend.</p><p>So, Agatha found herself leaving her office early to make the trip across town to the soccer field. A few other parents were watching the practice, and Agatha smiled politely as she took her place near the halfway line.</p><p>Nicky waved when he saw her, and Agatha waved back, glad to see him so happy as he raced around with the ball at his feet.</p><p>It took Rio longer to notice her—she had been crouched with another of the boys when Agatha had arrived.</p><p>When she did, Agatha was amused to see Rio do a double-take, like she hadn’t expected Agatha to be there. Which was fair—it was the first practice she’d attended, after all—and she was gratified by the way Rio’s eyes slid over her figure, her lips curving into a bright smile.</p><p>Agatha stood there for the remaining ten minutes of practice, knowing she should be watching Nicky but unable to keep her gaze from darting to Rio. She was everywhere, jogging around the boys and demonstrating moves with the ball at her feet, moving with an easy grace Agatha envied.</p><p>At one point—and Agatha didn’t know if this was for her benefit, but liked to assume it was—Rio lifted her hoodie over her head and finished the rest of practice in just her tank top. Agatha tried not to salivate at the sight of her bare arms on display, at the muscles in her back and her stomach, accentuated by the clingy material.</p><p>Was the woman <em>trying </em>to kill her?</p><p>By the time Rio blew the whistle to signal the end of practice, Agatha was feeling a little hot under the collar.</p><p>Nicky skipped over to her, Billy and Tommy a few steps behind.</p><p>“Hi, boys. Would you mind waiting here a sec? I just need to ask your coach something before we head home.”</p><p>“Okay, mom.”</p><p>Agatha kept one eye on the three of them as she crossed over to where Rio was bending to collect cones—and if Agatha’s gaze lingered a second too long on Rio’s ass as she approached, could you really blame her?</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>At the sound of Agatha’s voice, Rio—disappointingly—straightened up. “Hey. Didn’t expect to see you here today.”</p><p>“Yeah, well. I thought I’d surprise you.”</p><p>“And surprise me you did.” Rio’s gaze tracked down Agatha’s torso, lingering at the open collar of her shirt. It left her collarbones bared, as well as hinting at the swell of her breasts beneath. “You teach your classes like that?”</p><p>“I may have undone an extra button or two before I got out of the car.”</p><p>“Mm, well, I appreciate that.”</p><p>“Good.” Agatha bounced on the balls of her feet, feeling an inexplicable bought of nerves. “I, um, I’ve been thinking about what you said.”</p><p>A sculpted eyebrow rose. “Oh yeah?”</p><p>Agatha tried not to get distracted as a bead of sweat ran down the side of Rio’s neck—what she’d give to swipe it away with her tongue. “Yeah. I’ve thought about it. A lot.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“Have dinner with me on Friday?” The words rushed out of her quick, nervous—when was the last time Agatha had been nervous about anything?</p><p>“I’d love to, but I can’t Friday.” At least Rio looked regretful. She brought a hand up as if to run it through her hair before realizing that it was tied up, and let her arm fall back down to her side. “I, um, I’m booked all evening.”</p><p><em>Booked</em>. Agatha knew that could only mean one thing, and tried not to deflate too obviously. Still, she’d known none of this would be easy—there were too many potential pitfalls—so she wasn’t dissuaded. “How about lunch, then? I’m free between twelve and two?”</p><p>“I… yeah.” Rio almost looked surprised by Agatha’s easy acceptance. “Yeah, twelve works for me. We could meet outside the science building? Where we talked last time?”</p><p>“Great.” Agatha would love nothing more than to close the distance between them and press a lingering kiss to the curve of Rio’s cheek, but she forced herself to step back, away of the three ten-year-olds standing not too far away. “I’ll see you then.”</p><p>“Not coming to pick Nicky up from practice on Wednesday?” Rio called as Agatha began to walk away.</p><p>She turned to glance at Rio over her shoulder. “Maybe, maybe not. It’s fun to keep you guessing.”</p><p>Rio’s soft laughter echoed in her ears as she returned to the boys. “You three all ready to go?”</p><p>“Uh-huh.” Nicky fell into step beside her, Billy and Tommy half a step behind them. “What were you asking Coach Vidal about?”</p><p>“Oh…” Agatha paused, searching her brain for a viable excuse. “Just wanted to check when your next game was.”</p><p>“It’s Sunday, mom. I could’ve told you that.”</p><p>“Yes, but you <em>also </em>forgot to give me the permission slip for your museum trip last week, Nicky—sometimes you’re not the most reliable.”</p><p>He grumbled, but seemed to accept it, and Agatha breathed a sigh of relief. All three boys piled into the backseat of her sedan. She was content to listen to them chatter about practice—Rio and how good she was a prominent feature of their conversation—as they made the short ten minute trip to their neighborhood.</p><p>Agatha opted to park in her own drive and walk Tommy and Billy over to Wanda’s.</p><p>When she knocked on Wanda’s door, she opened it with a smile. “Hi! Thanks for picking them up today, Agatha.”</p><p>“Not a problem.”</p><p>“Mom.” Nicky tugged at Agatha’s sleeve. “Can I please go and play Minecraft with Billy and Tommy before we go?”</p><p>Agatha glanced down into his pleading eyes. “I’m sure both you and the boys have homework you should be doing first.”</p><p>“Please? Thirty minutes, I swear.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips and looked toward Wanda, who was suppressing a smile of her own. She could tell by the look on Wanda’s face that she didn’t mind—they’d been doing this dance for years. The boys had been inseparable since they’d met in kindergarten. “Fine. Thirty minutes. Starting now.”</p><p>Nicky squeezed her tight before racing into the house after Billy and Tommy, the three of them hurrying toward the living room and the PlayStation that Wanda and Vision had caved and bought a few months ago.</p><p>“Boys, hey?” Wanda waved Agatha inside, leading her over to the open-plan kitchen where they could keep an eye on the boys but wouldn’t necessarily be overheard.</p><p>“I know. What did we do to deserve it?”</p><p>“I have no idea. Although twin girl teenagers?” Wanda shuddered. “I’m not sure that would have been any better.”</p><p>Remembering what she’d been like as a teenager, Agatha had to agree. She leaned against the counter as Wanda fussed with a pot on the stove. “Do you need any help cooking?”</p><p>“No, thank you. I just need to simmer this now until Vision comes home.” After turning down the heat, Wanda came to stand beside her. “So, not that I’m complaining, but are you going to tell me <em>why </em>you wanted to pick the boys up today?”</p><p>Damn. Agatha really thought she’d gotten away with it. Doubly so, if she and Rio were going out for lunch—if they’d gone out in the evening, Agatha would have been forced to ask if Wanda could watch Nicky, and that would open up a whole can of unexplainable worms.</p><p>“Maybe I just felt like doing a good deed.”</p><p>“Mm, I’m not sure I believe that, Agatha.”</p><p>“Rude. I do nice things sometimes.”</p><p>“Yes, you do, but the boys practice literally five minutes away from where I work. You had to come all the way across town—finishing early—to get them.” Wanda was like a dog with a bone when she felt like there was a mystery to be solved.</p><p>She was a dream when it came to escape rooms.</p><p>Less so when she was digging into Agatha’s personal life.</p><p>“Okay. If I tell you, you can’t freak out, and you can’t say anything to anyone.”</p><p>Interest sparked through Wanda’s eyes and she shifted closer. “You know I’m an excellent secret keeper.”</p><p>“I wanted to go today because I… wanted to see Rio.” Agatha kept her eyes on Wanda’s face so she could assess her reaction. Which was mostly one of confusion, her eyebrows scrunching. “Well, I wanted to speak to Rio.” Agatha glanced down, fiddling with the hem of her shirt, and took a deep breath. “I, um, kinda asked her on a date.”</p><p>“<em>What</em>?!”</p><p>Wanda’s voice was loud enough to make three heads pop over the back of the couch.</p><p>“Okay, I would <em>firmly </em>class this as freaking out,” Agatha hissed, before shooting the boys a smile. “Everything’s fine, boys. Carry on with your game.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, you cannot drop a bomb on me like that and expect me to be calm!” At least Wanda had regained her inside voice, her words whispered angrily into the scant space between them. “I feel like I’ve missed about a thousand steps, can we go back a little?”</p><p>“I told you I wanted to date women.”</p><p>“Yes, <em>after </em>you also told me you weren’t ready yet.”</p><p>Agatha groaned, letting her head fall back so she could stare at the ceiling. “Do you think it’s too soon?”</p><p>“Do <em>you </em>think it’s too soon?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t hesitate. “No. I… I think I fell out of love with Ralph a long time ago. I don’t know if I was ever even <em>in </em>love with him. Not the way I should have been. So even though it’s only been a few weeks since we split up, it’s… it feels like it’s been longer than that.”</p><p>“Okay. <em>That </em>part makes sense to me—though we might need to circle back to the never been in love with him at all part, because what the <em>fuck</em>, Agatha, you were together for like twenty years—but what doesn’t is where Rio comes into this. I mean, I have eyes. She’s hot. But she’s also… <em>you know</em>.”</p><p>“Believe me, I do know.” While it was actually nice, to air some of these thoughts—some of her inner turmoil over the last few weeks—aloud, there were some things she wasn’t willing to share. The evening she’d already spent with Rio was one of them.</p><p>“And you’re okay with what she does?”</p><p>“In theory. In practice… I guess I won’t know until we try.” Agatha sighed. “But I do want to try.”</p><p>“Since <em>when</em>?”</p><p><em>Since the first moment I saw her</em>. “We’ve talked a few times. After I first met her, I ran into her on campus. And then when Nicky hurt his nose at practice. We’ve texted a few times, too. She’s just… I don’t know. There’s something about her, Wanda. I can’t stop thinking about her. And I mean, you said it yourself. She’s <em>hot</em>. I think there could be something there. Something worth exploring.”</p><p>“Hmm.” Wanda drew out the sound, and then she shook her head. “You know, I’ve never seen you look like that when you’ve talked about Ralph.”</p><p>“Like what?”</p><p>“I don’t know. It’s like your eyes lit up when you started thinking about her. I’ve never seen you look like that before.”</p><p>Agatha ducked her head, letting her hair fall across her face so she could hide behind it. “Yeah, well. It’s been a long time since I felt like this.”</p><p>“Is it… you don’t have to answer this if you don’t want to—but have you felt like this before? Or is women a new thing?”</p><p>Keeping her gaze trained on the floor—her shoes were scuffed, she should really clean them up—Agatha sighed. “No, Wanda, it’s not a new thing. But when you have a mother like mine, it wasn’t something that was acceptable when I was younger. And I was stupid enough to listen to her.”</p><p>“Hey.” A finger pressed against her chin, tilting her head upright. “You’re not stupid. I have met your mother, and that woman is terrifying. You haven’t done anything wrong.”</p><p>“Haven’t I?” Agatha’s laugh came out hysterical, and she bit it back before she attracted any unwanted attention from the living room. “I let her convince me to marry Ralph. I stayed with him for twenty years, even though, deep down, I knew he would never be what I really wanted. God, I actually feel <em>sorry</em> for him. No wonder he stepped outside our marriage. Can you really blame him?”</p><p>“Yes, actually, because he stayed in the marriage, too. If he wasn’t happy, he should have told you, and he should have broken it off instead of getting his kicks elsewhere. <em>You </em>never strayed.” Wanda narrowed her eyes. “Right?”</p><p>“Of course not.” Agatha had kept herself in much too deep a state of denial to ever even consider it.</p><p>“Look, it’s clear both of you made mistakes, and neither of you is completely faultless in this. But you can’t change the past, Agatha—and you deserve to be happy. If that’s with Rio, then good for you.”</p><p>Agatha found herself blinking back tears—it wasn’t often she opened up, and when she did, she hated the way it made her feel. Like her insides had been scooped out, churned around, and stuffed back in again but all in the wrong places, too sharp and too fragile. She didn’t have many friends—wouldn’t even have Wanda, if not for Nicky—but she knew she was lucky to have someone like Wanda in her life. “So you don’t think Rio is another mistake?”</p><p>“It doesn’t really matter what I think, Agatha,” Wanda said gently. “It matters what <em>you </em>think. And it’s clear from the way you’ve talked about her that you want this. You don’t need anyone else’s permission to do that. Well, other than hers, but I’m assuming she said yes, because she’s an idiot if she turned you down.”</p><p>Laughing, Agatha felt some of the tension slither from her shoulders. “She said yes. We’re getting lunch on Friday.”</p><p>“Lunch? But then there’s no chance of her walking you back to your door and you inviting her inside for a ‘nightcap’. Boring.”</p><p>The mere thought of Rio inside her home made Agatha’s cheeks warm and her stomach drop in a not entirely unpleasant way. “Yeah, well. She wasn’t free in the evening, so I made do.”</p><p>Something in the tone of Agatha’s voice made Wanda’s eyebrows twitch. “And when you say she isn’t free…”</p><p>“She has a client, yes. Which I really don’t want to think about, so if we could just skate over that, I’d be grateful.”</p><p>“Oh , Agatha.” Wanda’s fingertips brushed against the small of her back. “What <em>are </em>you getting yourself into?”</p><p>Agatha wasn’t entirely sure.</p><p>But she was excited—and sure, nervous as hell, too—to find out.</p><p>Friday couldn’t come quick enough, because she knew as soon as she had Rio in front of her, those brown eyes on hers, those red lips pulled into a warm smile, it would assuage any and every single one of those doubts.</p><p>And the thought of Rio’s hands on her again? Even if it was only an innocent touch, a brush of a hand against her back, or her wrist, or her cheek; a brush of her calf beneath the table with her foot?</p><p>Well, Agatha knew it would <em>burn </em>of all those doubts away, leaving nothing but fire in their wake.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>“Can I ask a question, Professor Harkness?”</p><p>The voice of one of Agatha’s students—David? Darren? Dennis? Fuck, she was so shit at remembering all their names—halted Agatha’s progress in getting all of her belongings packed into her bag as quickly as possible.</p><p>Did David/Darren/Dennis not know she was running on a very tight schedule?</p><p>Already, two hours was <em>not </em>long enough to spend with Rio after not hearing from her since Monday. Three full days of agonizing silence, where every buzz of Agatha’s phone had made hope leap into her chest, wondering if it would be a text from Rio.</p><p>Of course, Agatha could have reached out to her, too.</p><p>But she hadn’t wanted to come off as too eager—too <em>desperate</em>—so she’d held herself back, forcing herself to be content with the fact that, for two hours at least, Rio would be all hers.</p><p>Except her time was already being eaten into. It took a lot of willpower not to brush the student off, but Agatha forced a smile. She was a harsh teacher—she did not accept mediocrity, only excellence—but she was a good one. A fair one. And part of that was making herself available to those who were willing to ask for help, even when it was a massive inconvenience for her.</p><p>“Of course. What’s on your mind?”</p><p>What was on his mind was an honest curiosity about the lecture Agatha had just delivered on the end of the Salem Witch Trials—which turned into a riveting discussion that Agatha actually regretted having to cut short.</p><p>It was rare for her to see such passion from her students—most were only in classes as a means to an end, or cared only about the goriest parts of history, rather than the nuances and complexities of living in the time periods she covered—and Agatha promised they could pick it up after the following lecture as she hurried out the door of the room.</p><p>By the time she reached the science building, she was running seven minutes late, and half-expected Rio to have left.</p><p>But no, she was sitting on a bench, head bent over her phone, looking delectable in a pair of tight black jeans with rips at the knees, a white shirt, and a red and white flannel shirt.</p><p>Agatha glanced down at her own outfit. She hadn’t wanted to dress up too much for classes, so had chosen her regular slacks, but paired it with one of her nicer blouses. The material was gauzy, meaning she’d donned a tank top beneath, but it gave a glimpse of her collarbones and breasts that she hoped Rio would appreciate.</p><p>“Sorry I’m late,” Agatha said, out of breath as she careened to a stop in front of Rio. Not her finest entrance, but she hadn’t wanted to waste another second. “I got held up after class.”</p><p>“It’s okay.” Rio, as was customary, tracked her gaze across Agatha’s body, taking in every inch of her. “You look amazing.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Would she ever be able to stop herself blushing when Rio gave her a compliment? “So do you. Shall we?”</p><p>Rio pushed herself off the bench and slid her phone into the back pocket of her jeans. “Where to?”</p><p>“I thought we could go somewhere off-campus, if that’s okay with you?” While Rio wasn’t her student, Agatha did not want to be observed on a date by anyone who was. And given the number of classes she taught, the likelihood of one of her students being in any of the establishments on campus at any given time was high.</p><p>“Wherever you like.”</p><p>“I’ll drive.” Agatha would need to be able to concentrate on <em>something</em> other than Rio’s close proximity. Then she realized she probably shouldn’t presume, and glanced at Rio. “If that’s okay with you?”</p><p>“Sure.” Rio followed as Agatha began to head for the parking lot. “Though for the record—I kinda liked you just making the decision.”</p><p>“Oh?” Agatha’s heartrate ticked up. “I thought <em>you </em>liked doing that. Being in control.”</p><p>“Professionally, yes.” As they walked, Rio leaned in, her breath warm against the shell of Agatha’s ear. “Personally? I’m <em>more </em>than happy to let someone else take the wheel.”</p><p>“You’re not only talking about driving, are you?” Agatha liked all of Rio’s laughs, but this one—the low and dirty chuckle—that one was her absolute favorite. And hearing it so close to her ear… well.</p><p>Let’s just say it was a miracle she didn’t trip over her own feet.</p><p>“No, Agatha, I’m not.”</p><p>“Okay, well, I’m going to need you to stop talking like that when we get to my car unless you want me to crash it. Or drive you straight to my house.”</p><p>Rio leaned away, wide smile on her mouth. “I mean, I wouldn’t be opposed to going back to your house. But you’d have to cancel your afternoon classes, because an hour isn’t nearly long enough for all the things I want to do to you.”</p><p>Jesus <em>fucking </em>Christ. Agatha tugged at the collar of her blouse. Had it always been so tight against her neck? Or could she just not breathe because of the thought of Rio, her, a bed and several uninterrupted hours to—</p><p>“Here we are.” Agatha’s voice was too high, too strained, as they reached her sedan. As Rio climbed into the passenger seat, Agatha shoved her bag in the trunk and allowed herself to take a moment, to take a breath, to calm the jittery feeling in her stomach and the aching temptation to clamber straight across the center console and straddle Rio’s lap.</p><p>
<em>Get it together, Harkness. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Find some self-control. </em>
</p><p>After another deep breath, Agatha rounded the car and slid behind the wheel. The place she had in mind was only a five-minute drive away, but it was upmarket enough that she was certain no Westview student had ever set foot inside.</p><p>Her fellow professors might, but Agatha didn’t care about being seen by any of them. Most of them had a low opinion of her anyway. But it wasn’t <em>her </em>fault none of them could meet her ridiculously high standards.</p><p>“How’s your week been?” Agatha asked once she’d pulled out of the parking lot, needing to say something to break the silence between them. It wasn’t an awkward one, but the less time Agatha had alone with her thoughts—her dirty, <em>dirty </em>thoughts—the better.</p><p>Rio shrugged. “Oh, you know. Could’ve been better, could’ve been worse. I had to grade twenty papers from one of the classes I’m a TA for, which is always fun. And my advisor—whose class it was, to be clear, so he knew full well I was busy—is on my ass about why I haven’t sent him my latest chapter.”</p><p>“Academia, huh?”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “Sometimes I wonder what I was thinking.” She turned to rest her cheek against the headrest, eyes on the side of Agatha’s face. “You like it though, right?”</p><p>“I love it,” Agatha said. “I’ve never even considered doing anything else. Teaching is great, but teaching something you’re passionate about is even better. Even if it does come with a lot of grading.”</p><p>“And why history?”</p><p>“I’ve always been interested in it, ever since my first class in high school. I think learning about the past is important to learn how to shape the future. And the more I learn, the more I love it.”</p><p>“I can tell—you get this really cute look on your face when you talk about it.” Rio’s smile was wide. “Almost as cute as your blush whenever I say something nice about you.”</p><p>“Stop it.”</p><p>“Stop what? Saying nice things about you? Why? Are you not used to hearing them?” When Agatha didn’t answer, Rio sucked in a breath. “You’re not?”</p><p>“Not really.”</p><p>“Your ex-husband is an idiot.”</p><p>“Yes, well, I don’t really think that should be a surprise.” Agatha turned into the parking lot of the restaurant, but when she pulled to a stop Rio didn’t seem inclined to move, her eyes on Agatha with a startling intensity.</p><p>“I mean it, Agatha. You should be told that you’re beautiful every single day.”</p><p>Agatha shifted in her seat. “Have you looked in a mirror, lately?”</p><p>“I find it’s best not to compare myself to other women.” Rio reached over to tuck a strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear, then brushed her fingertips across the arch of her cheekbone. “But I mean it. You <em>are </em>beautiful.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Rio trailed her fingers over her jaw and down the side of her neck, and Agatha let out a shaky breath. “If you keep doing that we might end up back at my place after all.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes sparkled. “Hey, I told you my terms for doing that.”</p><p>“I don’t fuck on the first date.” Not that she’d <em>had </em>a first date since she’d been twenty years old—and definitely had not subscribed to that rule.</p><p>“<em>You’re </em>the one who keeps talking about taking me back to your place. Talk about mixed signals.” But Rio’s hand dropped from Agatha’s skin to wrap around the door handle. “Shall we go eat?”</p><p>“No place I’d rather be.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">* * *</p><p align="center"> </p><p>They were directed to a booth in the corner of the restaurant, nestled away from the prying eyes of the handful of other patrons inside.</p><p>Rio sat opposite her, elbows on the table and head in one of her hands as she glanced over the menu. Beneath the table, her leg bounced and Agatha wondered if it was with nerves.</p><p>Surely not.</p><p>Surely <em>she </em>was the only one who felt out of her depth here.</p><p>“Is everything okay?” Agatha asked, once she’d settled on her order—a cajun chicken flatbread. “Your leg might be about to break through the floor.”</p><p>“Sorry.” Rio flashed Agatha a shy smile. “Nervous habit.”</p><p>“What could you <em>possibly </em>have to be nervous about?”</p><p>“Well.” Rio set down her menu, and Agatha found herself distracted by the way her fingers moved to smooth it closed. “For one, I’m on a date with a gorgeous woman who is well out my league—”</p><p>“Bullshit. Again—have you <em>looked </em>in a mirror lately?”</p><p>“—even if she is more than happy to interrupt me.” Rio shot her a dark look, but Agatha could tell from the way her lips threatened to twitch into a smile that she wasn’t really annoyed. “And she brought me to a fancy restaurant—”</p><p>“You think this is fancy?” Sure, it was no greasy diner, but it was far from Michelin-starred.</p><p>“—in the middle of the day, and I only have…” Rio glanced at the watch on her wrist, “another hour with her before I have to try and focus on grading another ten papers this afternoon.”</p><p>“However will you cope?”</p><p>“I have no idea, but I think I’ll manage.” Apparently unable to sit still, instead of bouncing her leg, Rio gently slid the side of her foot against Agatha’s calf beneath the table.</p><p>She chose to do this at the exact moment that Agatha’s mouth opened to give her order to the server—meaning her first attempt at speaking was a rather undignified squeak.</p><p>Rio hid her smirk behind a cough, and managed to order her own meal—a hamburger—even with Agatha’s glare boring into her face.</p><p>After their server left them, Rio managed to ease Agatha’s glare when she reached across the table to cover Agatha’s hand with her own, fingertips dancing in a distracting rhythm across the back of her knuckles.</p><p>It felt nice. Rio had been right last Saturday, it had been <em>eons </em>since someone had last touched her for the sake of it. And while Rio’s intentions might not be wholly innocent—she seemed to be enjoying the effect it had on Agatha (softer breaths, fluttering eyelashes)—Agatha sure as hell wasn’t going to stop her.</p><p>“So, how long’s it been since you did this?” Rio asked, chin propped up in her other hand.</p><p>“Dated?” She pursed her lips when Rio nodded. “Well, I was married to Ralph for twenty years, so… it’s been a minute.”</p><p>“Wow. And have you ever dated a woman before?”</p><p>Biting her bottom lip, Agatha allowed herself a moment to gather her thoughts before she answered. It was not a part of her life she liked to remember. “Yes. When I was in college. Away from my mother’s influence, I dated a few. I even fell in love with one.” She swallowed, forcing herself to recall the shape of Becca’s face, the curve of her smile. “But then my mother found us together, and she…” Agatha squeezed her eyes shut, as if she could block out the words that still sprung so easily to her mind.</p><p>
<em>You’re such a disappointment, Agatha. </em>
</p><p>
<em>You were born evil. </em>
</p><p>
<em>If I’d have known you’d turn out like this, I wouldn’t have let you be born at all. </em>
</p><p>Rio seemed content to listen, her thumb still brushing over the back of Agatha’s hand. Her mouth, when Agatha changed a glance up at her face, was twisted into a grimace. </p><p>“She didn’t exactly take it well. And because I was young, and dumb, and absolutely terrified of her… I let her get into my head. We broke up, and I swore I’d never touch another woman again, and when she set me up with Ralph—the son of her friend from church—I just… went along with it.” Agatha ran a hand over her face, risking smudging the make-up she’d painstakingly applied that morning. “Like a coward.”</p><p>“I’m so sorry, Agatha.”</p><p>“You don’t think that’s terrible? Breaking Becca’s heart, lying to myself—lying to Ralph? Marrying someone I knew I could never truly love?”</p><p>“I think that’s human.” Rio’s hand covered the back of hers and squeezed. “We all make mistakes. And yeah, maybe you made some big ones. But that doesn’t make you a terrible person.” She shifted to interlace their fingers. “And selfishly, a part of me is glad everything happened the way it did, because if it didn’t, you wouldn’t be say across from me right now. And that would be a real fucking shame.”</p><p>Despite herself, Agatha laughed, her raw feelings eased by the sound of Rio’s voice. “So, how long has it been since <em>you </em>did this? A week?”</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched into a smile. “No. It’s been a minute for me, too. Not twenty years, mind you, but… I don’t know. Maybe two years since I last dated anyone?”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth fell open. “I don’t believe that for a second. Two years? You?”</p><p>“Why is that so hard to believe?”</p><p>“I don’t know. Because you’re young and you’re gorgeous and there isn’t a soul alive who would be in their right mind if they turned you down.”</p><p>“You’d be surprised.” Rio released Agatha’s hand as their food arrived, using both hands to dig into her burger with the kind of abandon that Agatha would have hated from Ralph but on Rio just seemed to work. “Fuck, this is amazing,” Rio said, tongue darting out to catch a bit of sauce from the corner of her mouth.</p><p>Agatha had to agree.</p><p>“Is there a <em>reason </em>you haven’t dated anyone in all that time? Haven’t you been lonely?”</p><p>“I mean, I’m not a nun.” Rio managed to pause the defiling of her burger long enough to answer Agatha’s question. “I’ve had a one-night stand here and there. But dating’s just… I don’t know. Exhausting. And as soon as a woman finds out what I do…” Rio clicked her fingers together. “She’s either gone, poof. Or she starts asking me <em>way </em>too many personal questions and wants me to do questionable things to her, which I might be into, but not on a first date with someone I don’t know. So, I decided it wasn’t worth it anymore and I stopped trying.”</p><p>Agatha realized then why Rio had been so implicit with Agatha. Why she’d urged her to make sure she really wanted this before asking Rio out. Because it <em>meant </em>something to her. Something deeper than just grabbing dinner or drinks.</p><p>Rio didn’t do this with just anyone.</p><p>But the fact that she was here, now, sitting across from Agatha with burger juice on her fingers and a spot of mayo on her chin, meant that she was just as invested in this as Agatha was.</p><p>The thought filled her with relief. “What made you say yes to me?”</p><p>“I told you—I think you’re fascinating. And then the fact that you already know about my job but it didn’t send you running for the hills. Or make you want to jump my bones.”</p><p>“Well, I wouldn’t go that far,” Agatha said, making sure Rio noticed the deliberate way her eyes traced across Rio’s upper body. She’d discarded the shirt earlier, leaving her shoulders bare, and those biceps…</p><p>Agatha was going to be dreaming about them later.</p><p>“No, you’re different. You wouldn’t believe the way some people speak to me when they find out. Like… I’m property. Nothing more than a tool they can use to get off. But you don’t look at me like that.”</p><p>“And how do I look at you?”</p><p>“Right now?” Rio paused so she could lick her fingers clean—which she did deliberately, and slowly, her eyes on Agatha’s the whole time. “Like you want to devour me.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t argue with that.</p><p>She felt hot all over, yearning for Rio to reach back across the table to take her hand. Even just that simple touch made her want to tremble—the thought of Rio touching more of her bare skin, running her hands over Agatha’s hips, breasts, thighs…</p><p>She might self-implode.</p><p>But what a fucking way to go.</p><p>“But it’s not in an ownership kind of way. It’s in a I-want-to-rip-your-clothes-off-and-never-stop kind of way.”</p><p>“I think that about sums it up.”</p><p>Rio laughed, leaning further back in her seat. “You’re a dangerous woman, Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>“Speak for yourself, Rio Vidal.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">* * *</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Agatha could have stayed in that booth all day, enjoying getting to know everything there was to know about Rio Vidal.</p><p>Rio told her some—lighter—stories from her time in foster care, how she’d gotten so into plants (<em>I was never allowed pets, so plants were my thing that I could keep alive, and take from home to home with me</em>), and even some funny stories about her early days as a dominatrix learning on the job.</p><p>In return, Agatha talked a little more about her job, and the classes she was teaching that semester. Rio asked her about Nicky, and Agatha told her how he’d gotten into soccer—Vision’s fault—and how much she’d missed him the weekend he’d spent away from her.</p><p>They strayed away from any more talk of painful pasts, failed relationships, and Rio’s looming evening with a client who was decidedly not Agatha.</p><p>When the time came to leave, Agatha was filled with regret, wishing she could stay there for the rest of the afternoon. Because Rio was magnetic, her stories funny, the cadence of her voice a balm to Agatha’s jagged heart. At no point was the conversation stilted, or awkward, or did the silence become uncomfortable.</p><p>It was the easiest date Agatha had ever been on, by <em>far</em>.</p><p>She wanted another one already.</p><p>She knew the lesbian U-haul joke well—but she’d never thought for a second it would ever apply to her.</p><p>Pulling into a space in the Westview parking lot, Agatha turned to Rio with a pang in her chest.</p><p>But it seemed she wasn’t the only one who wasn’t ready for their date to end just yet. “Let me walk you to your next class?”</p><p>“I’m going to my office, actually. It’s my office hour ‘til three.” And based on the horrific assignment she’d set earlier that week, she was expecting a few students to drop by.</p><p>“Even better,” Rio said, a twinkle in her eye that Agatha didn’t have the heart to say no to.</p><p>“They’re renovating my usual building, so I’ve been relegated to the geography department,” Agatha said as she led Rio across campus.</p><p>“And how’s that working out for you?”</p><p>“Terribly. My office is too cramped, and the coffee machine they have in their kitchen is diabolical. I’d be better off drinking muddy water from a puddle.”</p><p>“Have you considering buying your own machine?”</p><p>“And let the rest of those vultures use it? Not a chance.” Agatha hurried up the steps to the geography building, aware she only have five minutes before her office hours started. The plus side of being in this building, though, was she was on the first floor rather than the third. Which, when the elevators were out more often than not, was a huge pain in the ass. “And as you can see,” Agatha said as she unlocked her office door, indicating the small space with a wave of her hands, “there isn’t exactly much space to put one inside here.”</p><p>“That’s because every available surface is covered with books.” Rio glanced around with a critical eye, letting the door fall shut behind her as Agatha set her bag on her desk. “Have you considered that most things are on the internet, now?”</p><p>Agatha shot her a glare. “Very funny. <em>You </em>try finding well cited articles online about medieval history.”</p><p>“This book <em>looks </em>like it’s from medieval history.” Rio ran a finger along the spine of one of the books on Agatha’s shelf—when Agatha saw her, she gently smacked her hand away.</p><p>“You won’t find a first-hand account of medieval history like that on the internet, either. No touching my books.”</p><p>A wicked look crossed Rio’s face as she bit her bottom lip. “<em>Just </em>your books?”</p><p>Agatha rose to the challenge she saw in Rio’s eyes. “Is there something else in here you’d like to touch, Rio?”</p><p>“Mm, yes.” Rio shifted closer, her hands dropping to Agatha’s waist, thumbs caressing the sharp lines of Agatha’s hip bones. “Very much so.” She ducked her head, pressing her forehead against Agatha’s. “I know you said you don’t fuck on the first date, but do you kiss on them?”</p><p>“Depends how nicely you ask me,” Agatha breathed, already knowing the answer was a resounding <em>yes</em>.</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio raised both of her hands, cupping Agatha’s cheeks and tilting her chin up towards her. “Can I kiss you?”</p><p>“<em>Please</em>.”</p><p>Rio leaned in, closing the scant few inches of space between them, until her lips brushed against Agatha’s. They were soft, and Rio was gentle, applying only the tiniest amount of pressure before leaning away.</p><p>It made Agatha’s heart race all the same, made her stomach clench and her center ache, no more so than when Rio’s dark eyes met her own.</p><p>“I’d kiss you harder,” Rio said, her thumbs running across Agatha’s cheeks, “but it will make it very hard to leave this room.”</p><p>“Then you’d better go.” Agatha’s voice was shaky, affected by Rio’s closeness, by her tender touch. “Before I kiss you again.”</p><p>“As you wish.” Rio kissed her forehead, just the briefest touch of her lips, before releasing Agatha’s cheeks and stepping toward the door. “I’d love to do this again sometime.”</p><p>“Me, too. But it’s your turn to arrange the next one.”</p><p>“I can do that.” Rio pulled open the door, and Agatha was relieved there was no student waiting for her outside. She needed some time to pull herself together, to force the flush from her heated cheeks. “Te veo, Agatha.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>When Agatha arrived at her office on Monday morning, a plant—and a re-usable mug of coffee—was waiting for her outside her door.</p><p>Smiling, Agatha scooped both up as she unlocked her office door, reaching for the tiny note tucked into the leaves of the plant.</p><p>
<em>I wish I could’ve spent this weekend with you. I can’t wait until Friday. </em>
</p><p>
<em>P.S. This coffee is from the Biology building. If it’s up to snuff, you’re welcome to visit me—sorry, the coffee machine—whenever you like. </em>
</p><p>“Who’s your secret admirer?” Agatha jumped at the sound of Jen’s voice, turning to find her longest-serving—and most grating—colleague standing in the hall. Why their offices had ended up opposite one another even after the move was some kind of sick joke.</p><p>“No one.” Agatha refrained from closing the door in Jen’s face—she could be civil, when it suited her—and set the plant down on the edge of her desk.</p><p>“Oh, so those just magically appeared outside your door?”</p><p>“Stranger things have happened.”</p><p>“Yeah, right.” To Agatha’s annoyance, instead of leaving her alone, Jen stepped inside her office and reached out a hand to play with the leaves of the plant. “It’s bad form to accept gifts from students, you know.”</p><p>“Good thing it’s not from a student, then, isn’t it?”</p><p>“So you <em>do </em>have a secret admirer.”</p><p>“It’s not a secret to <em>me</em>.” Agatha kept the card clenched tight in her fist, not trusting Jen not to take it and read it if left with the opportunity.</p><p>“Aren’t you married?”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, looking away from Jen’s probing gaze. She was private at work—they only knew about Ralph because of the ring on her finger. Had only met him once or twice at work functions or awards dinners—certainly none within the last few years. Opening up about her divorce hadn’t exactly been at the forefront of her mind, considering she did her best to keep herself to herself. “We’re separated. Divorcing.”</p><p>“Oh shit. I’m sorry.”</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “Don’t be. Good riddance, as far as I’m concerned.”</p><p>Jen’s eyebrows shot up, her hand dropping back to her side. “Wow. Don’t hold back or anything. And you’re already moving on?”</p><p>“I don’t really see how that’s any of your business.” Agatha’s handle on her temper was rapidly fading the longer Jen stood in front of her. “Now, if you don’t mind, I have things to do before my first class today…”</p><p>Thankfully, Jen took the hint, ducking out of Agatha’s office without another word.</p><p>Once she was gone, Agatha closed the door behind her and settled behind her desk, bringing the coffee to her lips. It wasn’t as good as the coffees from <em>Espresso Yourself</em>, but in comparison to the dregs from the geography department, it was divine.</p><p>She hummed as she set the mug back on her desk. It was covered in snaking thorny vines, like the ones in Rio’s tattoo, and the thought that Rio had made her a coffee, in her own mug, and taken the time to drop it off outside her office made something warm settle in her chest.</p><p>Reaching for her phone, Agatha pulled up the message thread with Rio. They’d texted on and off all weekend, Rio clearing her schedule for Friday so she could take Agatha out in the evening. Ralph had asked if he could take Nicky again—Agatha was glad to see him stepping up, as long as he didn’t want <em>too </em>much time with him—so she’d been quick to agree.</p><p>But Friday seemed so far away…</p><p>She opened up a new message.</p><p>
<em>The coffee is passable. If I did want to get myself another cup, where would I find this mysterious coffee machine? </em>
</p><p>The reply was almost instant.</p><p>
<em>Well, you couldn’t just wander the halls of Biology by yourself… there’s critical and secretive experiments going on in here, you know. I would, however, be willing to take you to it—if you so desired. </em>
</p><p>Agatha glanced at the time—she had forty minutes before her first class of the day. And, despite what she’d said to Jen, she had very little she needed to do before it. Without Ralph in the house, Agatha could spend her evenings working once Nicky was in bed—so sue her for being a <em>little </em>obsessed with her job—meaning all she had to do in the mornings was read any emails she’d gotten overnight.</p><p>
<em>Are you free now? </em>
</p><p><em>Eager</em>.</p><p>From the speed of the reply, Rio wasn’t one to judge.</p><p><em>But yes, </em>came the follow-up. <em>I’ll meet you outside the building in five? </em></p><p>
<em>Sure. </em>
</p><p>Pushing herself away from her desk, Agatha slid her phone into her pocket and grabbed the mug, drinking the rest on the short walk over.</p><p>Like Rio didn’t already know that the coffee was just an excuse to see her.</p><p>When Agatha arrived, Rio was already waiting in the doorway in her signature ripped jeans and combat boots. “Hi,” she said, her smile bright and warm. “Glad you liked the coffee.”</p><p>“And the plant. Though it’s awfully bold of you to assume I can keep one alive.”</p><p>“You’ve kept a kid alive for ten years.” Rio held the door open for her and ushered Agatha inside. “And that’s much harder than remembering to water a plant every other day.”</p><p>“You <em>say </em>that, but at least Nicky can remind me when he’s hungry.”</p><p>Rio’s laughter echoed off the walls.</p><p>Agatha had never been inside the building before—never had a reason to, before today. The walls were white, the air sterile as Rio led her deeper inside. They passed a few lecture halls, then labs, their walls glass and allowing Agatha a glimpse at the benches within with a handful of people in white lab coats tinkering with equipment that probably cost more than the history department’s budget for the entire year.</p><p>“Do you have an office in here?”</p><p>“I do, but I share it with five other grads. To say getting any useful work done in there is a challenge is an understatement.” Rio shouldered open a set of double doors. “The kitchen is in here.” She settled a hand on the small of Agatha’s back as she led her inside.</p><p>It was small, a round table in the center. The counterspace was taken up by the precious coffee machine, a toaster, and a microwave—as well as an array of mugs and dirty plates.</p><p>A single person sat at the table, a laptop in front of him. Agatha had never seen someone wear so much eyeliner—it matched the painted black of his nails.</p><p>“Hey, William.” Rio lifted her hand in a wave as she gently took the mug from Agatha’s hands. “Too loud in the office?”</p><p>“Yes.” William pressed his fingers to his temples. “If I hear one more story from Brad about all the women he slept with at parties this weekend…”</p><p>“Brad has never seen a woman naked in his life.” With practiced ease, Rio set her mug beneath the spout, fiddling with the buttons as Agatha watched.</p><p>William snorted. “Please say that to his face.”</p><p>“Oh, I have.” As the machine hissed and whirred, Rio turned to lean her back against the counter. “This is Agatha, by the way.”</p><p>Agatha managed a small smile beneath William’s clear scrutiny. She wasn’t sure how she was supposed to act in here—did Rio want people to know they were dating? Did <em>Agatha</em>?</p><p>Well… maybe not anyone in her own department. Not because she was ashamed of Rio, or anything like that. She was done with her years of hiding, of caring what other people might think. It was only because Jen would be fucking insufferable about it if she ever got a look at Rio.</p><p>“She might be around a lot from now on,” Rio continued, the words casual.</p><p>William barely blinked. “Cool.”</p><p>“And Agatha, this is William. Of my fellow PhD students, he’s one of the least annoying.”</p><p>“That might be the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me.”</p><p>“Yeah, well.” Rio’s lips pulled into a fond smile as she looked at him. “Don’t get used to it.”</p><p>“Noted. Hey, Agatha.” William’s gaze settled on her face. “Do you like board games?”</p><p>Rio groaned. “Oh my God, William, quit it. Agatha does not want to join your games nights.”</p><p>“How do you know?” William looked affronted. “She might. And then you’ll have to come.”</p><p>Amused, Agatha watched the two of them bicker, almost like they were siblings. “When you say board games… do you mean like Monopoly?”</p><p>When William’s eyes lit up, Rio groaned. “Oh, you’ve done it now, Agatha. Asking him that is like putting a coin in him—he’s going to talk your ear off for the next thirty minutes. At least.”</p><p>Agatha glanced at her watch. “Well, I only have twenty until I need to head to class, so…”</p><p>“I can work with that.” William pushed the lid of his laptop down, a serious look on his face. “No, I do not mean Monopoly. There are so many other board games out there, Agatha. You’re missing out if that’s the only one you can think of. There’s co-operative games, and deck building games, and roleplaying gam—”</p><p>“Okay, no.” Rio cut him off with a shake of her head. “If Agatha only has twenty free minutes, she is not spending it listening to you prattle on.”</p><p>“But—”</p><p>“Nope.” The coffee machine finished spluttering, and Rio snatched up the mug to press it into Agatha’s hands. “One passable coffee.”</p><p>“Thank you. Do you not want your mug back?”</p><p>“Keep it. I have more.”</p><p>“She really does,” William piped up again, looking deflated. “You would <em>not </em>want to see Rio without her three morning coffees.”</p><p>Agatha, who would very much like to see Rio before any coffees—preferably because she’d woken up stretched out to her in bed—had to disagree.</p><p>“Come on, I’ll walk you out.” Rio’s hand returned to the small of her back, burning even through the thick material of her cardigan. “Say bye, William!”</p><p>“Nice to meet you,” he said. “And if you <em>do </em>decide to expand your horizons, Agatha, our next games night is Wednesday, at—”</p><p>Rio closed the door behind them, cutting off the last of his sentence.</p><p>“Hey, what if I wanted to go?”</p><p>Rio arched an eyebrow. “<em>Do </em>you?”</p><p>“…No. Although dragging you along and making you suffer through it would be entertaining.”</p><p>“Mm, if you want me to suffer, Agatha,” Rio leaned in close, breath warm in Agatha’s ear, and the tone of her voice, low and husky, curled around Agatha’s throat, settled in her stomach, hot between her thighs, “there are much more <em>pleasurable </em>ways to achieve that.”</p><p>Agatha tripped over her own feet.</p><p>If not for Rio’s arm wrapping around her waist, she probably would have fallen right on her face.</p><p>“You okay, there?” Rio asked, voice twinkling with as much amusement as her eyes.</p><p>“Fine.” Agatha cleared her throat, wishing she could as easily clear her mind of all the pleasurable ways she could make Rio suffer. Fuck.</p><p>“You sure?” Rio’s arm remained curled around her, fingers splayed across Agatha’s hip.</p><p>Her shirt had risen up, Rio’s fingertips brushing her bare skin, and what Agatha would give to be in a room with a door that locked. Friday could not come quick enough. “Mhm.”</p><p>Rio let her go, and when they reached the doors of the building, Agatha felt a flicker of regret. She didn’t want to go—didn’t want to leave Rio—but the thought made her realize that she <em>needed</em> to. She needed some space, needed to not let her head become too clouded, like it did whenever they were together.</p><p>They’d been on <em>one </em>date.</p><p>After her first date with Ralph, Agatha had felt nothing but a looming sense of dread about their second.</p><p>She needed to calm herself down, needed not to fall so fast, needed to cool off.</p><p>“I’ll see you Friday, then?” Agatha said, turning to face Rio and fighting the urge to lean up and kiss her goodbye.</p><p>“Unless you want more coffee before then.” Rio’s smile was warm, sent heat curling through Agatha’s body. “I’ll pick you up at eight.”</p><p>“Looking forward to it already.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">* * *</p><p> </p><p>When Ralph called her at twelve thirty on Friday, Agatha had a sense she wasn’t going to like what he was going to say.</p><p>“Agatha, I’m really sorry to do this on such short notice, but I can’t take Nicky this weekend.”</p><p>Irritation thrummed through Agatha’s body. He’d had one weekend, <em>one</em>, in the six weeks since she’d kicked him out, and now he was flaking?</p><p>Agatha was going to ki—</p><p>“It’s my mother.” He at least sounded somewhat apologetic. “She had a fall this morning, and I’ve been at the hospital with her since. They’re going to keep her in overnight, but I’ll be back and forth all weekend to see her—you know she doesn’t have anyone else.”</p><p>Some of Agatha’s anger deflated. She wasn’t a monster—even if she <em>did </em>hate his mother, she didn’t wish her any ill will. And he wasn’t cancelling because he was flaking, it was a genuine emergency. “Of course, Ralph.”</p><p>“Thank you.” His relief was palpable. “Will you tell Nicky I’m sorry? And that if I can, I’ll still make his game on Sunday?”</p><p>Agatha thought of her, Ralph, and Rio all being in the same place at the same time and shuddered. “I’ll tell him. Do you need anything? Food? I can swing by and drop off some supplies after work.”</p><p>“No, we’re fine, but thank you. I… I appreciate it, Agatha. I… I know we haven’t talked much over the last few weeks if not about Nicky, and I know I said a lot of things I regret the day we ended things, but I… I hope one day we might be able to be friends. For Nicky, if nothing else.”</p><p>“I hope so, too.” Ralph wasn’t a terrible person. He’d been a terrible husband, toward the end, but Agatha knew she’d been far from a perfect wife. And they’d gotten on well, once upon a time. Had been good friends. Getting back to that would be nice. “Well, if you change your mind give me a call. And I’ll hopefully see you at the game Sunday.”</p><p>“Thanks, Agatha.”</p><p>He hung up, and Agatha sighed. There went her kid-free weekend. Which, normally, wouldn’t be a problem—except for the date she’d been very much looking forward to that evening.</p><p>Agatha knew Wanda and Vision were away until Sunday, so they wouldn’t be able to watch Nicky. She could ask Mrs. Hart, one of her elderly neighbors who, since her husband had passed away and left her incredibly lonely, loved babysitting whenever the opportunity presented itself.</p><p>But something about palming Nicky off on the neighbors after his plans with Ralph fell through felt wrong. She never wanted him to feel like a burden, or like he was second choice. That was too close to how her own childhood had played out for comfort.</p><p>So, regretfully, Agatha reached for her phone and dialed Rio’s number. She really hoped she wasn’t about to ruin things.</p><p>“Hi.” Rio answered on the third ring. “You couldn’t wait until tonight to hear my voice?”</p><p>She sounded so excited that it made Agatha wince. “About that…”</p><p>“You canceling on me?”</p><p>“I don’t want to.” The mere thought made Agatha cry—she’d been looking forward to this all week. She hadn’t seen Rio since coffee on Monday, limiting herself to scattered texts. “But Ralph’s mother has been taken ill, so he can’t have Nicky tonight, and I don’t want to abandon him, too. I feel terrible, but can we reschedule?”</p><p>“It’s okay, Agatha.” Rio’s disappointment was clear, but the words were sincere. “You don’t have to apologize for being a good mother.”</p><p>“I’m sorry. I know you cleared your evening for this.”</p><p>“Don’t worry about it. Will you have Nicky next weekend, too?”</p><p>“I’m not sure.” Agatha fiddled with her hair, a nervous habit her mother had ever managed to break. “But if I do, I can get someone to watch him for the night.”</p><p>“Okay. Then we can arrange something for then. And I’ll see you at the game Sunday, right?”</p><p>“Yes.” But there, they would be surrounded by children and parents and not have a moment to themselves without a dozen eyes on them. The thought of waiting another full week to have Rio to herself was torture.</p><p>“So that’s not too long to wait to see me.”</p><p> “Or… you could come over to my place tonight.”</p><p>A beat of silence, as Rio processed what she’d said. “But… won’t Nicky be there? Are you ready for him to know we’re seeing one another?”</p><p>“He’ll be in bed by nine.” It was reckless, to suggest it. Nicky would be in bed, but he’d still be in the house. He could have a bad dream, or need a glass of water, or just not be able to sleep—could come downstairs and discover Rio in his home and ask questions Agatha wasn’t sure she was ready to answer.</p><p>Not that she wanted to keep Rio a secret forever.</p><p>But it was a delicate line, dating her son’s soccer coach.</p><p>“Are you <em>sure</em>?” Rio didn’t sound sold on the idea, and Agatha didn’t really blame her.</p><p>But… she’d missed Rio that week. And having to wait another seven days to be able to kiss her again? Unacceptable. “Yes. It’ll be fine. Please?”</p><p>“Well, seeing as you asked so nicely… okay.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>“Night, Mom.”</p><p>“Goodnight, sweetheart.” Agatha offered her cheek for Nicky to kiss as he passed her. She listened to him trudge up the stairs, heard the familiar sounds of his footsteps as he paced the bathroom while he brushed his teeth, before his bedroom door clicked closed.</p><p>Agatha let out her breath, nervous energy thrumming beneath her skin as she pulled out her phone.</p><p>
<em>Whenever you’re ready, the coast is clear. </em>
</p><p>The reply was quick, like Rio had been waiting with her phone in her hand. <em>On my way. Be there in thirty. </em></p><p>Thirty minutes for Agatha to spiral about what a terrible idea this could be. But it was too late for her to back out now—Rio had already left, and Agatha was too drunk on the thought of having Rio in her home to stop her coming over.</p><p>She flitted around the house, tidying away the dishes from dinner, making sure the rabbit was locked up tight, folding and re-folding the throw blankets that sat on the back of the couch for when the nights grew colder.</p><p>Her phone buzzed. <em>I’m outside. Don’t want to risk knocking. </em></p><p>Agatha crossed to the front door, pulling it open to reveal Rio on the other side. She wore a leather jacket, her hands buried in the pockets. It was unzipped, revealing the shirt beneath—which was a dark green with a <em>deep </em>v-neck that made Agatha’s mouth water.</p><p>Behind Rio, a car pulled out in the road.</p><p>“You didn’t drive here yourself?”</p><p>“I called an Uber, because I drive a motorcycle,” Rio said, as she brushed past Agatha into the house. “Which isn’t exactly subtle when you’re sneaking into someone’s house.”</p><p>“No, it’s not. And of course you do.”</p><p>Rio grinned as she shrugged out of her jacket, hanging it on the hooks beside the door. It looked out of place next to Agatha’s collection of waterproof coats and woolen jackets, but she liked the sight of it, nestled amongst her own belongings.</p><p>Her shoes went next—black sneakers, instead of her usual boots—leaving her an inch shorter but still slightly taller than Agatha. “You sure this is okay?”</p><p>“It’s fine.” Nicky was a heavy sleeper. “Can I get you a drink? I have wine or beer.”</p><p>“Beer sounds good.” Rio trailed after Agatha as she walked down the hall to the kitchen, her eyes flitting across the dozens of family photographs Agatha had splashed over all the walls.</p><p>Agatha was sure Nicky would hate them in a few years, but she loved them. Loved remembering him as a squalling baby, nestled in her arms, then an energetic toddler, little more than a blur in most of the photos because he’d never been still for long.</p><p>And then there were his first days at school, every birthday, every important event in his life.</p><p>“I am aware that my walls are basically a shrine to Nicky,” Agatha murmured as they stepped into the kitchen.</p><p>“I think it’s sweet.” Rio settled herself at the kitchen island as Agatha opened the refrigerator.</p><p>“You don’t think it’s too much? It’s a different vibe from your place.”</p><p>Rio accepted a bottle of beer from Agatha with a smile. “It is, but I’m aware my place is pretty impersonal.”</p><p>“Is that because of your work?” Rio’s bedroom, after all, had been in complete contrast to the rest of what Agatha had seen.</p><p>“Mm. I don’t necessarily want my clients knowing too much about me. For privacy reasons, and also because it would ruin the illusion for them if they could see photographs of me downing a keg or playing soccer.”</p><p>“So is that what I’d find in your photo albums?”</p><p>“Maybe.” Rio took a sip of beer, her eyes on Agatha’s back as she poured herself a glass of wine. “I can’t wait to decorate properly once I retire, though. Finally put some color on the walls.”</p><p>“Not black, I hope.”</p><p>“What’s wrong with black?” Rio looked offended as Agatha approached her, wine glass in hand. “Don’t you think I look good in it?”</p><p>“I do.” Agatha lifted her glass to her lips, watching Rio’s gaze flit to her neck as she tilted her head back. “But that doesn’t mean it would look good in your hallway.”</p><p>“I suppose not.”</p><p>“And how many plants are you going to have in there? Your yard is already out of control.” Though if that was one of the few places in her home Rio could express herself, perhaps that was why.</p><p>“You sound awfully concerned about my future décor choices.” Setting her beer on the counter, Rio reached for Agatha’s hips and pulled her in close. “Are you planning to stick around that long?”</p><p>It was a loaded question to ask on a second date, but Rio’s tone was <em>just </em>the right side of teasing to lessen the weight of it. “Depends.” Discarding her own glass of wine—after another long sip—Agatha draped her arms over Rio’s shoulders to press their chests flush together.</p><p>“On?”</p><p>“On whether or not you’re going to kiss me properly, tonight.”</p><p>Rio didn’t immediately take the bait, much to Agatha’s annoyance. Instead, her eyes lit up, her fingers flexing against Agatha’s hips. “I kissed you properly last week.”</p><p>“You gave me a peck.”</p><p>“Mm, I suppose I did.” Rio leaned closer, skimmed her nose across Agatha’s cheek before settling her mouth at Agatha’s left ear. “And where would you like me to kiss you properly, Agatha?” Her lips pressed to the skin just beneath her ear. “Here?” Then the sharp edge of Agatha’s jaw. “Here?”</p><p>Her breath <em>seared </em>against Agatha’s skin, marking her like a brand.</p><p>Agatha had only taken two sips of wine but she felt punch-drunk already, dizzy from the promise of Rio’s mouth so close to her skin.</p><p>“Or maybe…” Rio ducked her head, and the next kiss she pressed to Agatha’s skin—lower on her neck, against the tendons that stood out there when Agatha tilted her head to the side—was open-mouthed, her tongue flickering against Agatha’s skin. “Here?”</p><p>Agatha drew in a ragged breath—it sounded too loud, too echoing, but maybe that was all in her own head—as Rio did it again, only this time, she scraped with her teeth. Agatha’s knees buckled, and she had to reach one hand down to grip the edge of the counter to keep herself upright.</p><p>Which.</p><p>Humiliating.</p><p>But her neck was sensitive, and she didn’t remember the last time someone had kissed her there. And when they had, it hadn’t been like <em>this</em>—Rio’s lips warm, her tongue wicked, soothing away any sting from her teeth.</p><p>Agatha’s reaction only seemed to spur Rio on further—her mouth opened wider, moving in a hot slide down to where Agatha’s pulse throbbed at the base of her throat.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha breathed, and she slid her other hand—the one not holding onto the counter for dear life—from Rio’s neck and into her hair. It was silken beneath her fingertips, and when Agatha gently ran her nails over Rio’s scalp, her groan reverberated against Agatha’s throat.</p><p>And then she kissed her harder.</p><p>“Do not,” Agatha said, through broken breaths, “leave a mark.”</p><p>“Mm, I like you giving me orders.” Rio lifted her head, her eyes dark and wanting, pupils blown wide. “I’m <em>very </em>good at following them—feel like I’ve kissed you properly, yet?”</p><p>Given her heaving chest, racing heart, and aching clit, Agatha felt well and truly debauched, despite the fact that Rio had barely even touched her. “Not sure. I might need to collect more evidence.”</p><p>Before Rio had the chance to argue, Agatha used her hold of Rio’s hair to finally, finally steer Rio’s mouth against her own.</p><p>Unlike their first kiss, this was anything but chaste.</p><p>Rio’s mouth slanted against hers, open and wanting, and Agatha slipped her tongue between Rio’s lips to move against hers in a hot slide. Rio moaned into it, using her grip on Agatha’s hips to press her back against the counter, trapping her there with the warm solid weight of her body.</p><p>Agatha buried both hands in Rio’s hair, tugging at it when she realized Rio liked that. In response, Rio sucked Agatha’s bottom lip between her teeth, biting gently and then harder when she heard Agatha whimper.</p><p>Fuck, Agatha was on fire. Was spontaneous human combustion possible? Because if it was, she was dangerously close.</p><p>Rio pressed impossibly closer, arching Agatha’s back over the counter. Agatha threw out an arm to brace herself—and promptly knocked over Rio’s bottle of beer.</p><p>The clatter wasn’t loud, comparatively—certainly not loud enough to travel up the stairs where Nicky might hear them—but it made them spring apart all the same.</p><p>Rio righted the bottle before too much could spill, and the pink of her cheeks, the heated look in her eyes, the flush on the skin of her chest left bared by the neckline of her shirt… Agatha wanted to devour her.</p><p>She took a shuddering breath, trying to calm the racing of her heart, and grabbed a towel to mop up the beer that had managed to make its way onto the counter just for something to do with her hands that wasn’t dragging Rio upstairs to her bedroom.</p><p>“Sorry,” Rio said, watching Agatha clean up. “Guess I got a little carried away there.”</p><p>Agatha shot Rio a look over her shoulder. “I wasn’t complaining.” She hung the damp towel out to dry and stood on the other side of the counter, keeping the island between them. “Though maybe we shouldn’t do that again while Nicky’s in the house.”</p><p>“And why’s that?” Rio asked, her eyes sparkling at Agatha across the island. “Worried you can’t control yourself?”</p><p>“Maybe.”</p><p>“Me too.”</p><p>They shared a smile, and Agatha lifted her wine glass to her lips hoping it would ease her parched throat. “Want to go watch a movie?”</p><p>“It wasn’t exactly what I had planned for the night, but sure.”</p><p>“What <em>did </em>you have planned?” Agatha asked once they were settled on her couch. She’d made sure to shut the door firmly behind them, kept the lights low and the sound quiet as she allowed Rio to pick what they watched.</p><p>It was, of course, a horror movie. One that Agatha had never heard of, but she was content just to bask in Rio’s presence.</p><p>“Ah, that would be telling. I can’t reveal those secrets—you’ll find out when I finally get to take you out.”</p><p>“So confident there’ll be a next time?”</p><p>Rio shrugged, stretching an arm across the back of the couch to wrap around Agatha’s shoulders. “You seemed pretty into me in the kitchen.”</p><p>At the reminder—and the light touch of Rio’s fingertips against her bare shoulder, drawing patterns across her skin—Agatha shuddered. There was no denying she had been <em>very </em>into it—as the persistent ache between her thighs and the damp patch in her underwear she felt whenever she shifted constantly reminded her.</p><p>“I’m sorry you cleared your Friday just for this.”</p><p>“Don’t be. I’m happy I still got to see you. That makes it worth it, in my book.”</p><p>It was sweet, and Agatha shifted to rest her head on Rio’s shoulder as the movie began, curling into her side. She was blisteringly warm, chasing away the chill in the air, and Agatha breathed in the earthy scent of her mingled with the floral scent of her shampoo.</p><p>Rio’s hand shifted to Agatha’s hair, combing through it with her gaze focused on the TV. Beneath her ministrations, Agatha felt herself relax further, eyes fluttering shut the longer Rio worked.</p><p>And she must have fallen asleep, because the next thing she knew, Rio was gently shaking her shoulder. The TV had gone off, the room dark other than the glow of Rio’s phone, open in her hand.</p><p>“Shit, I’m so sorry.” Mortification flooded through Agatha’s body as she realized what had happened. How long had she been asleep? “I’m terrible company.”</p><p>“No, it was nice.” Rio’s smile was warm and genuine, her fingers gentle as they tucked a wayward strand of Agatha’s hair behind her ear. “You clearly needed it.”</p><p>“Still. I invited you over here and then passed out on your shoulder.”</p><p>“I didn’t mind.” Rio’s fingers skated down the side of her neck before she dropped her hand back into her own lap. “Honestly. I… I like you that you felt safe enough with me to let your guard down like that.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, because she hadn’t been thinking of it that way. But Rio was right. In many ways, she was still somewhat of a stranger—they’d spent only a handful of hours together, not enough to truly get to know one another.</p><p>And yet, Agatha <em>did </em>feel safe with her.</p><p>And it wasn’t as scary as she thought it would be.</p><p>“I would’ve let you sleep for longer, but it’s getting late and I don’t know what time Nicky will have you up in the morning, but I’m guessing it won’t be late.”</p><p>“He’s getting better. And soon he’ll be a teenager and he’ll barely leave his room. Have you called a ride?”</p><p>“It’ll be here in five minutes.” Rio flashed Agatha her phone screen, which tracked the car on its way to her. “Walk me to the door?”</p><p>Agatha took Rio’s hand and led her to the hall, watching her pull on her leather jacket and wishing she could ask her to stay the night.</p><p>But it was still so early, and she didn’t want to have to sneak her out of the house in the morning before Nicky started asking questions, so instead she drew Rio close to kiss her goodbye.</p><p>It wasn’t chaste, but it wasn’t as heated as their earlier kisses, either—it left Agatha feeling warm all over, eager for the next one.</p><p>“I’ll see you on Sunday,” Agatha promised, as Rio pulled open the front door.</p><p>“Looking forward to it already.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">* * *</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Just like at his last game, Nicky raced across the soccer field to Billy and Tommy as soon as they arrived, leaving Agatha to trudge along behind him.</p><p>Wanda and Vision waited for her, and Agatha was swept into a warm hug by Wanda when she reached them.</p><p>“I feel like I haven’t seen you in ages!” Wanda said. “We need a proper catch up soon. I want to hear all about your date on Friday.”</p><p>“Date?” The voice from behind Agatha was familiar—and unwelcome. When she turned her head, Ralph stood a foot away, a look on his face like he’d just been slapped across it.</p><p>“Oh, shit.” Wanda glanced at Agatha with wide eyes. “Sorry. I did not know he was coming today.”</p><p>Agatha smoothed a hand across Wanda’s back, though she really wished her friend knew how to keep her mouth shut. “It’s okay. Hi, Ralph. How’s your mom doing?”</p><p>“They let her out of the hospital this morning. She’s at home now, resting.” Ralph buried the hands in the pockets of his jeans and rocked back on his heels. “You’re already dating?”</p><p>Agatha tried not to rankle at the tone of his voice—because it <em>must </em>be a shock, considering she’d shown zero interest in him for the past few years of their marriage. “I’ve been out once or twice, yes. Is that a problem?”</p><p>“I… no. I guess not.” His face crumpled into a frown, though, like he wasn’t happy about it.</p><p>Like Agatha cared what he thought. Given his transgressions, she had every right to move on whenever she felt like it. She refused to be judged for it.</p><p>“Does Nicky know?”</p><p>“No.” Agatha drew her jacket tighter around herself. “It’s new, and I wouldn’t introduce anyone to him unless it was serious. And not without talking to you.” Never mind the fact that Nicky was already well aware of who Rio was. Though Agatha knew introducing Rio as her girlfriend rather than his soccer coach was completely different.</p><p>Not that Rio <em>was </em>her girlfriend.</p><p>Two dates did not a relationship make.</p><p>“I would hope you would extend the same courtesy, too,” Agatha continued. “When you decide to start dating again.”</p><p>“Of course. Sorry.” Agatha was surprised by the apology—he didn’t say sorry often. “I didn’t mean to sound so judgy. It’s just… it’s weird, right? It’s been twenty years.”</p><p>“I know, Ralph. This isn’t exactly how I wanted you to find out.”</p><p>“Sorry, again,” Wanda piped up from behind them. “That was very much my bad.”</p><p>“It’s okay, Wanda. I’d rather know, I think.” Ralph offered Agatha a small smile. “Anyone I know?”</p><p>At that exact same moment—because of course it was—a whistle blew on the field to call both teams to attention, and Agatha heard Rio’s voice.</p><p>“Let’s go, team!”</p><p>She swallowed. “No.”</p><p>“Well, I hope it works out for you. And maybe I’ll get to meet him one day.”</p><p>Agatha chose not to correct him. It wasn’t the time, nor the place to tell him she was dating a woman. And not just any woman, but the woman who stood only a few feet away, on the opposite side of the field as the boys took their positions.</p><p>For the first time since arriving, Agatha allowed herself to drink Rio in.</p><p>Her hoodie was wrapped around her waist, leaving her in a ribbed black tank top. It clung to the muscles of her stomach, the curve of her breasts, and left her neck and collarbones bare. Her hair was tied up, but a few strands had escaped to hang around the side of her face, and Agatha itched to be able to reach across the distance between them and brush them away.</p><p>Rio’s eyes darted briefly away from the action on the field to toward Agatha.</p><p>When their eyes met, her smile was radiant, lighting up her face, her eyes bright. Agatha smiled back automatically, remembering the heat of Rio’s touch, the warmth of her embrace and the comfort Agatha had felt being in her arms.</p><p>She ached to do it all over again.</p><p>“Do you want to take Nicky this coming weekend, seeing as you didn’t get him this one?” Agatha found herself asking.</p><p>Ralph turned his head to look at her. “Would that be okay with you?”</p><p>“I don’t want to keep him from you, Ralph.”</p><p>“Then yeah, I’d like that. Thanks.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, eager to tell Rio and hoping she would be able to make some time for Agatha at the weekend. She glanced at Rio again, which was a mistake, because she found herself struggling to focus on the game playing out in front of her when she could be watching Rio’s reactions, instead.</p><p>At Nicky’s last game, Agatha had been determined to keep her eyes as far away Rio as possible, but this time, she had no such qualms.</p><p>It was clear she was so, so invested in the boys, from the way she bobbed and weaved her head as they raced from one end of the field to the other. Whenever Westview made it into the opposition box, Rio rocked forward on her toes, hands clenching—and then groaning loudly when nothing came of it.</p><p>When Tommy scored, she raised both arms above her head, the most animated Agatha had ever seen her—and it was clear from the way all the boys rushed over to celebrate with Rio that they adored her as much as Rio did them.</p><p>Westview won by four goals to two, in the end—though Agatha had to confess that she missed at least two of the goals, admiring the way the sunlight brought out golden hues in Rio’s dark hair—and when the final whistle blew, Nicky bounded over to them with a wide smile.</p><p>“You came!” He said, wrapping his arms around Ralph’s middle.</p><p>“’Course I came, buddy. I didn’t want to let you down again. I’m sorry I missed your first game, but I’ll try and make the rest of them.” He ruffled Nicky’s hair. “Save your mom from having to come to them all. You know how much she hates soccer.”</p><p>The thought of missing a game sent a pulse of panic through Agatha’s body. “I don’t mind it.”</p><p>“Please. In twenty years, I’ve never been able to persuade you to watch it.”</p><p>Over Ralph’s shoulder, Agatha watched Rio approach—she hesitated when she heard Ralph’s words, a small frown crossing her face before it was quickly blinked away.</p><p>“Yes, well, that was then. And it wasn’t Nicky playing.”</p><p>Ralph shrugged. “Suit yourself.”</p><p>Nicky leaned around Ralph’s legs and noticed Rio hovering, a bright smile crossing his face. “Hi, Coach Vidal!”</p><p>“Hi, Nicky. You played well again, today. And so did you two.” Rio glanced at the twins. “Great goal, Tommy.”</p><p>Tommy beamed.</p><p>Agatha glanced at Ralph, wondering if Rio’s voice would spark any recognition. Even if he and Rio had never been face-to-face, they would have spoken—Agatha knew Rio handled booking all of the appointments—but Ralph merely smiled blandly as Rio took the final two steps toward their group.</p><p>“I don’t think we’ve met,” he said. “I’m Nicky’s dad. You seem to be doing a great job with the kids.”</p><p>If Rio was uncomfortable talking to Ralph, it didn’t show in the easy smile on her mouth. “That’s all down to them, not me, Mr. Harkness.”</p><p>“Oh, I’m not Mr. Harkness,” Ralph said. “That’s Agatha’s maiden name. She didn’t want to take mine when we got married.”</p><p>“<em>No one</em> would willingly want to take your name, Ralph.” Agatha wasn’t particularly fond of her own surname, given her rocky relationship with her mother, but it was preferable to Ralph’s.</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, glancing at Agatha. “It can’t be that bad.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips, watching Rio’s reaction. “It’s Bohner.”</p><p>Rio did not disappoint, trying—and failing—to hide her laughter behind a cough. “Your last name is Bohner? Okay, no offence but maybe that <em>is </em>that bad. Wow. I understand why you didn’t change it.” Her eyes twinkled in the low sunlight, and Agatha ached to be able to wrap her arms around Rio and pull her in close, hating the careful few feet of distance between them.</p><p>She hadn’t expected it to be this difficult.</p><p>Hadn’t expect to want—crave—Rio this much so soon.</p><p>Nicky grew bored with their conversation and tugged at Agatha’s arm, his gaze pleading. “Can we all go and get ice cream again? With Dad this time, too?”</p><p>“I…” Agatha glanced toward Rio, wanting nothing more than to stay a little longer, linger in her presence for more than a stolen few seconds. But she couldn’t think of an excuse that wouldn’t be an obvious one, or lead to further questions from Ralph or Nicky. “I don’t see why not.”</p><p>“Yay!” Nicky wrapped his arms around her waist in thanks. “I’m going to get mint chocolate chip this time.”</p><p>“Enjoy yourselves,” Rio said, lifting her hand in a wave. “You’ve earned it.”</p><p>“You’re welcome to join us if you like.” It was Wanda who made the offer, and Agatha wondered if she could sense how much Agatha wanted to stay. “I’d argue you’ve earned it, too.”</p><p>“It’s kind of you to offer, but I shouldn’t.” Rio’s smile was apologetic. “Wouldn’t want any of the other kids to think I have my favorites. Plus, I have somewhere to be soon and I wouldn’t want to be late.”</p><p>Agatha wondered if that was true, or if it was an excuse.</p><p>Hanging out with three of the kids she coached and their parents—one of whom was her situationship and her situationship’s ex-husband—probably wasn’t high up on Rio’s idea of a good Sunday afternoon.</p><p>“I’ll see some of you at practice tomorrow.” With one last wave, Rio turned her back and headed toward the parking lot.</p><p>Agatha watched her go, wishing, as Nicky chattered on about the game with one hand in Ralph’s and the other in Agatha’s, that it was Rio and not Ralph she could spend the next hour with.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha had only taken a few steps inside the Biology building on Thursday morning before realizing she might be making a mistake.</p><p>Her sense of direction was usually good, but all the corridors looked the same—would it kill them to put some posters or flyers on the wall?—and she couldn’t for the life of her remember where Rio had taken her last week.</p><p>She <em>could </em>just grab her phone and call Rio.</p><p>But seeing as she hadn’t mentioned to Rio that she might drop by, that would ruin the surprise. </p><p>Plus, a part of Agatha was worried Rio might tell her not to come.</p><p>Agatha had been left with a gnawing feeling of guilt in the pit of her stomach with how they’d left things at the weekend. Considering their time together was so fleeting, Agatha felt like she should have made the most of it. She should have made more of an effort to talk to Rio, should have tried to persuade her to come along for ice cream.</p><p>In the few days since, Agatha had tried to reach out a few times, but Rio’s replies had been delayed and sporadic. And her attempts to arrange a date this weekend had been thus far unsuccessful, despite telling Rio that Nicky was with Ralph. But Rio was busy Friday, and wasn’t sure if she could re-arrange her Saturday…</p><p>It made her worry.</p><p>Panic that Rio was losing interest, or she’d come to her senses and realized that Agatha came with a lot of baggage and maybe dating the newly-separated parent of one of her soccer mentees wasn’t such a good idea.</p><p>Not that Agatha had been overthinking, or anything.</p><p>Agatha figured that Rio was just busy. She had three jobs, after all. It made sense that her biggest priority wouldn’t be texting Agatha about how her day was going.</p><p>But if Agatha could just drop by and <em>see </em>Rio, see her and speak to her in person, then Agatha would know if things were wrong, or if she was just spiraling for no good reason.</p><p>And if she could just figure out where Rio might be in this goddamn maze of a building, that would be a really good start.</p><p>A door opened in front of her, and a student slouched out of it. They had on a lab coat, a lanyard hanging from their neck with <em>Biology Department </em>printed around the edge, and glanced at Agatha curiously like they could tell she didn’t belong there.</p><p>“You wouldn’t happen to know where Rio Vidal’s office is, would you?” Agatha asked hopefully.</p><p>“Sure. Go through those doors there, take a left and find room 4B.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Agatha followed the instructions, passing two labs before the corridors changed into office space. Most of the doors were open, the sound of typing or chatter spilling out into the hall. It smelled of coffee and desperation—though maybe Agatha’s own grad school experience was clouding her judgement.</p><p>The door to 4B was one of the ones propped open. Inside, five desks were crammed into the tiny space. No wonder Rio had said she couldn’t get any work done in there—each desk backed onto another, the space between them so tiny it was a wonder anyone could get in and out of their chairs.</p><p>Only one desk was currently occupied—William glanced up as Agatha’s shadow fell over him. “Oh, hey Agatha. Are you looking for Rio?”</p><p>“I am—do you know where she is?” Agatha was starting to think coming over here unannounced hadn’t been a great idea, after all. She had no idea what Rio’s schedule was like. She might not even be on campus.</p><p>“She’s in the lab downstairs I think—I can go and get her for you if you like?”</p><p>“Only if it’s not too much trouble.”</p><p>“Not at all.” William skillfully maneuvered himself out of his chair without bashing into the one behind it. “I need to stretch my legs, anyway. Be right back.”</p><p>Agatha remained in the hallway while William disappeared through the doors at the opposite end of it. There, the walls <em>were</em> covered with posters and flyers. Most advertised various clubs and activities, but one in particular snared Agatha’s attention when she saw Rio’s name written on it.</p><p>
<em>This Friday’s Wine and Talk will be held by Rio Vidal, final year doctorate student, discussing her thesis topic: Understanding the genetics behind light and temperature regulation in different plant species. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Albert Lecture Hall from 7 p.m. </em>
</p><p>Agatha ran her finger across the time. Was that where Rio would be on Friday night? Not with a client, but somewhere on campus giving a talk? Was there a reason she hadn’t told Agatha about it?</p><p>At the sound of footsteps down the hall, Agatha pulled her hand back. When she turned, Rio was walking toward her, an open lab coat pulled on over her jeans and turtleneck sweater.</p><p>William was nowhere in sight, and Agatha was grateful for the chance to steal a few private moments alone with Rio.</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio smiled as she approached, which Agatha was taking as a good sign. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>“Do I need an excuse other than wanting to see you?”</p><p>“No.” Rio ushered Agatha inside the office and closed the door behind them. “I’m glad you’re here—just surprised. And embarrassed that you have to see my terrible office. Your temporary one isn’t so bad now, huh?”</p><p>“It’s not so bad in here.”</p><p>“Liar.” Rio leaned against one of the desks—Agatha had immediately clocked that one as hers, based on the spider plant hanging over the edge of it, and the skull coffee mug beside the laptop. “It’s awful.”</p><p>“Okay, it’s not great. But I have seen worse.” Agatha fiddled with the handle of the bag she held by her side, hovering beside William’s desk. “I, um, brought you something.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes lit up. “A present? For me?”</p><p>“Yes.” Before she could second-guess herself, Agatha pulled out the potted plant she’d picked up earlier that morning and held it out toward Rio.</p><p>“Blue hydrangeas,” Rio said as she accepted it, brushing her fingers gently over the petals. “Are you trying to say sorry for something, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks warmed, though she wasn’t surprised Rio knew the meaning of them. “Messing you around last Friday. And then barely speaking to you on Sunday.”</p><p>Rio carefully set the pot down beside her spider plant. “Well, I already told you that I was fine with how we spent Friday, and as for Sunday… you didn’t do anything wrong, Agatha. I didn’t expect you to spend any time with me—you were there for your kid.”</p><p>“So you haven’t been distant with me the last few days because of that?”</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows creased into a frown. “You think I’ve been distant with you?”</p><p>“I… no?” But it sounded like a question, and Agatha cursed herself. Had she gotten this all wrong? God, Rio really <em>had </em>just been busy, hadn’t she? And Agatha had freaked out over it, because she was a disaster who was waiting for something to go wrong, and she was going to ruin things just by being a—</p><p>“Hey, come here.” Rio reached for her hands and pulled her in close, so Agatha was effectively pinning her to the desk. “I’m really sorry if that’s the impression I gave you, because it’s not one I meant to. This week has just been insanely busy.”</p><p>“And this weekend?” Agatha hated how small her voice sounded.</p><p>“I’m still trying to see if I can move some things around on Saturday.” Rio did look apologetic, her thumbs brushing across the back of Agatha’s knuckles. “And believe me, I would <em>much </em>rather be with you on Friday than at this stupid grad school thing I’m being forced to do.”</p><p>“I saw the posters about that outside.” Agatha inclined her head toward the door. “You have to do a talk? With wine?”</p><p>“The wine is for the people listening,” Rio said. “Though a glass or two might help ease my nerves.” She shook her head. “It’s dumb. Once a month the department holds an evening with a different speaker—usually grad students, but sometimes professors—talking through their research. Everyone has to do at least one a year. And Friday’s my spot.”</p><p>“And did you never think that maybe I would want to come and support you? Or is it only open to people in your department?”</p><p>“I… no. Anyone can come.” A frown was back on Rio’s face—but this was one of confusion. “But why on Earth would you want to come and listen to me drone on about plants for an hour when instead you could be enjoying a child-free evening at home?”</p><p>“Well.” Agatha reached up to toy with the collar of Rio’s lab coat, the back of her knuckles brushing against the soft material of her sweater. “I don’t know if you’ve noticed, judging by the totally cool way I’ve played things today—not at all thinking you’re bored with me already when you took too long to reply to my messages—but I’m pretty interested in you, Rio Vidal. Enough to come and listen to you talk about anything.”</p><p>“Oh really?” Rio’s hands slid to Agatha’s hips, thumbs slipping beneath the material of her blouse to rest against her bare skin. “Even plants?”</p><p>“Even plants.”</p><p>“Okay. Then are you free Friday night?”</p><p>“Hmm… let me check my schedule and I’ll get back to you.” Agatha grinned when Rio rolled her eyes. “Yes, I am.”</p><p>“Then will you please come to my dumb plant talk? And if it’s not too late, maybe we can get dinner after?”</p><p>“I’d love to.”</p><p>“Cool.” Rio brushed her lips against Agatha’s, pulling back before they could get too carried away. “And for the record—I’m pretty sure I’m never going to get bored of you.” Her eyes met Agatha’s and caught her gaze, the earnest tone of her voice matched by the look on her face. “I’m sorry I haven’t been super contactable this week. If I’d have known it would bother you, I would’ve made more of an effort.”</p><p>“No, it’s okay. I just… I get in my own head easily. And sometimes it’s still so hard for me to believe that someone like you would ever be interested in someone like me.”</p><p>“Are you kidding?” Rio’s thumbs rubbed against her skin, making her shudder. “You’re the most interesting person I’ve ever met, Agatha Harkness. And you’re not going to get rid of me that easy.”</p><p>“Promise?”</p><p>Rio pressed her grin to Agatha’s lips. “I promise.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">* * *</p><p align="center"> </p><p>On Friday evening, Agatha slipped into the lecture hall at six fifty, wanting a few minutes to find the best seat.</p><p>To her surprise, the room was already half-full—around thirty people were spread around the seats, the low hum of chatter buzzing around the room.</p><p>Rio stood on the stage at the front, fiddling with a laser pointer and a stack of notes which made the tremor in her hands obvious. Her eyebrows were pinched together, her foot bouncing against the floor as she no doubt rehearsed what she was about to say.</p><p>Seeing her so nervous was a surprise—Agatha so rarely saw her as anything less than supremely confident and sure of herself. Though Agatha could say the same about herself—put her before a room of a hundred students and she was fine, but in front of a handful of her peers… that was much more daunting.</p><p>And she’d had a lot more years of experience.</p><p>As Agatha walked further into the room, Rio’s eyes flickered to hers. She wanted to comfort her, to tell it would be okay, but she didn’t want to draw attention to herself—or Rio—by approaching Rio at the front of the room. Instead, Agatha mouthed <em>you’ve got this</em>, and was gratified by the bright smile that crossed Rio’s face.</p><p>To one side of the room were two tables filled with empty glasses and full bottles of wines, as well as a selection of appetizers—cheese and crackers, empanadas and canapes.</p><p>As Agatha was pouring herself a glass of wine—she was here to support Rio, sure, but she wasn’t going to turn down free wine—William appeared by her side with a wave.</p><p>“Hey.” He snagged an empanada. “Rio said I should ask if you wanted someone to sit with—she also said I shouldn’t take it personally if you said no.”</p><p>As she lifted her glass to her lips—the wine was cheap, but it didn’t taste too terrible—Agatha smiled. “Some company would be nice.”</p><p>“Awesome. Then we’re over here.” She trailed William over to the third row, where two other people sat. “This is my boyfriend, Eddie.” William sat beside him and took his hand, before indicating the woman sat on Eddie’s other side with a streak of red in her hair. “And this is Alice. She’s in mine and Rio’s office, too.”</p><p>Both Eddie and Alice offered Agatha a wave.</p><p>“And this is Agatha. She’s Rio’s…” William trailed off, glancing toward Agatha as she settled into the open seat next to William. “I don’t want to label your relationship.”</p><p>“Let’s just go with friend,” Agatha said, with a tight-lipped smile. She wasn’t sure how much Rio had talked about her to her friends, after all. Or even how close they were—just because they were in the same office didn’t mean they were <em>good </em>friends. Agatha hadn’t had many friends in her own grad school cohort.</p><p>Alice snorted. “Yeah, right. No one who is <em>just </em>a friend would willingly come to something like this.”</p><p>Agatha leaned forward to better meet Alice’s gaze. “You’re all here, aren’t you?”</p><p>“Yeah, because we’re in the same department. It’s kind of expected. And Eddie’s just here because he and William are physically incapable of spending an evening apart.”</p><p>“Hey!” William and Eddie protested as one.</p><p>“What?” Alice looked unapologetic. “It’s true.”</p><p>Agatha took a long sip of her wine. “Maybe I just have a vested interest in plant biology.”</p><p>“Or <em>maybe </em>you just want to get into Rio’s pants.”</p><p>Agatha choked on her next sip of wine, and William patted her on the back as she coughed.</p><p>“If it’s any consolation,” Alice said, her eyes sparkling as she lights dimmed, “if you manage to stay awake during this whole entire thing, then you’re probably in with a shot. Hell, if you did this for me I’d probably marry you.”</p><p>Before Agatha had a chance to reply, the sound of a throat clearing carried from the front of the room. Agatha recognized the man standing by Rio’s side from faculty meetings she’d been forced to attend—Anthony Moore, the head of the biology department.</p><p>“Thank you all for joining us this evening for our latest Wine and Talk session. I know there’s more thrilling ways to spend a Friday night—but at least the drinks here are free, right?”</p><p>Polite laughter echoed around the room.</p><p>“Our speaker tonight is one of our own. Please give a warm Westview welcome to Rio Vidal.”</p><p>“Thank you, Anthony.” Rio stepped forward as the applause died down, only the slightest of wavers in her voice giving away her nerves. “And thank you, everyone, for coming tonight. Now, sit back, relax, and let me talk you through the fascinating world of plant genetics…”</p><p>Agatha considered herself a relatively knowledgeable person, with a higher IQ than the average American. But after about five minutes of Rio’s talk, she realized she had absolutely no clue what she was talking about.</p><p>Gene expression and transcription and photo- and thermo-morphogenesis meant nothing to her. Rio may as well have been speaking a foreign language.</p><p>And yet…</p><p>Agatha hung onto her every word.</p><p>Because Rio looked beautiful as she paced up and down that stage in a sleek black and white pinstripe pencil skirt, a matching blazer, and heels. Her confidence grew the longer she spoke, abandoning her notes halfway through and gesticulating with her hands to make her points.</p><p>And Agatha was completely and utterly captivated by her.</p><p>She’d thought, on her approach to the lecture hall, that an hour might be too long. But it passed astonishingly quickly with her attention so thoroughly stolen by Rio’s every word.</p><p>At the end, she powered through some audience questions, casually leaning against the podium on the stage.</p><p>Once it was over—after another round of applause from everyone in the hall—Agatha, along with William, Eddie and Alice, made their way to greet Rio. But they weren’t the only ones—a handful of others, some of them professors Agatha recognized, along with Anthony, beat them to it.</p><p>Agatha was content to hang back, watching the glow on Rio’s face as she basked in their praise, her passion for her subject clear to see.</p><p>By the time Agatha and Rio’s friends reached her, the rest of the hall had emptied out around them.</p><p>“Well done, Vidal.” Alice was the first to reach her, clapping Rio on the back. “Absolutely smashed it. And in front of your girl, too.”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks flushed the most delightful shade of pink. “Thank you. But Agatha isn’t my girl.”</p><p>“Well, clearly she <em>wants</em> to be, otherwise she wouldn’t be here.” Alice had refilled her glass of wine as they’d waited for Rio, and she polished it off in two gulps. “And congratulations, by the way, because she is <em>gorgeous</em>. Not sure how you managed to pull that off.”</p><p>“Can we please not embarrass me in front of the woman I’m dating?” Rio groaned. “Especially after I’ve just humiliated myself on stage.”</p><p>“Please. You killed it, Rio!” William looked at with awe. “I wish I had your confidence.”</p><p>“I didn’t feel it.” Rio looked exhausted, shoulders hunched as she sagged against the podium. “But at least it’s over with now.”</p><p>“Are we going out to celebrate?” Alice asked.</p><p>“<em>I</em> am,” Rio said, reaching out a hand toward Agatha to pull her in close. “But not with you.”</p><p>“Oh, I see how it is.” Alice’s face split into a teasing grin. “You get yourself a hot new girlfriend and you’re blowing off your friends?”</p><p>“Uh-huh.” Rio had given up correcting her, but Agatha didn’t mind. “She’s better company than you.”</p><p>“Well, then I guess we’ll leave you two lovebirds to it.” Alice glanced toward William and Eddie. “Are you two coming for a drink, or are you going to be boring and couple-y too?”</p><p>The pair shared a glance.</p><p>“We’ll stay for one,” William said. “And <em>only </em>one.”</p><p>“Suit yourselves.” Alice raised a hand toward Rio. “See ya around, Rio. And nice to meet you, Agatha. Enjoy the rest of your evening.”</p><p>Once they were gone, Rio pulled Agatha even closer into her side. “I’m sorry about them. And that you had to listen to that.”</p><p>“I like them.” Agatha looped her arms around Rio’s neck, content to breathe her in after a week without Rio properly in her arms. “And I liked listening to you even more.”</p><p>“Yeah? Why’s that?”</p><p>“First of all, because you look stunning.” Agatha ran her palms along the lapel of Rio’s blazer, gratified by the shudder that ran through Rio. “And second of all, because it’s nice seeing you in your element.”</p><p>“You think that was in my element?”</p><p>“Mm. I could tell you were nervous, but you grew into it. And I got to sit and watch you for an hour, so I count that as a win.”</p><p>“If you say so.”</p><p>“I do.” Agatha cupped Rio’s cheek, tilting her head so their eyes met. “I meant it when I said I find you interesting. Everything about you—even when I don’t understand a word that you’re saying.”</p><p>“Well, thank you for coming.” Rio closed the distance between them to kiss Agatha softly. “Now, do you wanna get out of here? I promised you dinner.”</p><p>“Lead the way.”</p>

<p>Rio’s first stop before dinner was to her office to change her clothes.</p><p>“Are you sure?” Agatha ran her gaze appreciatively along Rio’s legs, bared by her skirt, and the sharp cut of her blazer as she followed Rio inside the cramped room. “Because I like you in that outfit.”</p><p>“I feel like I’m playing dress up.” To Agatha’s shock, Rio yanked down the zipper of her skirt right there in the middle of her office, the material pooling at her feet as she kicked off her heels.</p><p>Agatha caught a glimpse of toned thighs, a flash of another tattoo on Rio’s right thigh, and a hint of black lace before she whirled around to face the wall. “Rio! Anyone could walk past and see you half naked!”</p><p>“Well, I’m not shy.” There was the sound of rustling fabric, and Agatha tried very hard not to wonder if Rio’s bra matched her underwear. “And it’s late. No one else will be in here.”</p><p>“<em>I </em>am in here.”</p><p>“And you don’t wanna see me naked?”</p><p>Agatha wanted to so much that she was all but vibrating with the need to turn on her heel, back Rio up against her desk, and drop to her knees between Rio’s thighs. “I didn’t say that. But this isn’t exactly how I imagined it.”</p><p>“You’ve imagined it?” Rio’s voice turned low, husky, the same tone she’d used the very first time they’d spoken on the phone. Footsteps approached, Rio’s hands settling on Agatha’s waist and her mouth close to Agatha’s ear. “How many times?” Her fingers curled into Agatha’s hip and tugged her so that her back was pressed against Rio’s front—thankfully, she was still wearing a shirt. “And, most importantly—how was I?”</p><p>“Should I be offended that <em>you </em>haven’t imagined it?” Deflection was safer than answering, than admitting that she’d dreamed of Rio’s lips against her skin, that she’d touched herself more than once with Rio on her mind.</p><p>“Oh, I’ve imagined it.” Rio pressed the ghost of a kiss to the skin beneath Agatha’s ear. “So many times. How you’d feel, how you’d sound, how you’d taste.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched, eyes fluttering closed as Rio’s warm breath washed over the skin of her neck. “I think we should get out of here right now,” she said, not recognizing the timber of her voice—rough, wrecked, <em>wanting </em>in a way she didn’t think she’d ever felt before. “Because if you keep talking, I’m going to let you find out exactly how I taste right here, right now.”</p><p>“Tempting,” Rio said, fingers flexing on Agatha’s skin, “but the walls are glass, and I don’t want anyone other than me seeing you like that.”</p><p>She stepped away, and Agatha drew in a deep breath, able to breathe easier without Rio’s hands on her.</p><p>When she turned, she found Rio dressed in jeans and a faded <em>Nirvana </em>tee, her skirt, blouse and blazer slung over the back of her desk chair.</p><p>“Mind if I grab my bag from my office before we go?” Agatha could have gotten it while Rio changed, but she hadn’t wanted to leave her—and despite her racing heart and weak knees, she was glad she’d stayed.</p><p>“Sure thing.”</p><p>They walked together, shoulders brushing, Rio telling her about the rest of her week and how nervous she’d been for her talk.</p><p>“I mean it when I said you did great, though,” Agatha said, as she shouldered open the door to the Geography department, tangling her fingers with Rio’s to squeeze her hand. “And now that it’s done with, you don’t—”</p><p>Turning the corner to her office, Agatha froze when she saw two people standing in the hall. It was late—much too late for anyone to still be lurking on a Friday night, and Agatha hadn’t expected to cross paths with anyone.</p><p>Certainly not Jennifer Kale—her sharp gaze taking in Agatha and Rio, the way they walked close together, the easy smile on Rio’s mouth, their joined hands—and Lilia Calderu, the history department chair and one of the few people Agatha respected on this campus.</p><p>“Little late for a department meeting, isn’t it, ladies?” Agatha tried to keep her tone as neutral as possible, releasing her grip on Rio’s hand and shifting to stand a half-step in front of Rio like she could hide her from Jen’s scrutiny. “Without me, no less.”</p><p>“Shockingly, Agatha, the world doesn’t revolve around you.” Jen’s gaze hadn’t dropped from Rio. “I know that might be hard for you to believe.”</p><p>“Play nice, Jen.” Lilia was used to hearing them bicker, but she was yet to tire of chastising them for it. “We were just having a discussion about the syllabus for Jen’s classes this upcoming semester, Agatha.”</p><p>“You don’t have better things to do on a Friday evening?” Agatha arched an eyebrow. “I know I’m a workaholic, but come on.”</p><p>“Well, we can’t always find a student to hang out with instead.” Jen’s lips quirked into a mocking smile as she finally switched her gaze to Agatha. “Please don’t tell me <em>she’s </em>the one who left those things outside your office.”</p><p>Fury surged through Agatha like a tidal wave. She <em>hated </em>the look of judgment on Jen’s face. “Like I told you at the time, Jen—it’s none of your fucking business.”</p><p>“Are you having a midlife crisis?”</p><p>“<em>Jen</em>.” Lilia shot Jen an annoyed look. “Agatha’s right—her personal life is none of our business.”</p><p>In her fifteen years as a professor at Westview, Agatha had kept her private life exactly that—private. She and Rio were barely anything, but her <em>boss </em>was aware of it.</p><p>“It is if she’s dating a student,” Jen muttered.</p><p>For the first time, Rio spoke up. “I’m twenty-nine and in the Biology department, asshole.”</p><p>Despite Agatha’s mortification, the absurdity of the situation made a laugh bubble in her chest that she was too slow to choke back.</p><p>Jen scoffed. “Wow, I can see why she likes you—you’re just like her. A match made in heaven.”</p><p>Lilia clicked her tongue. “Come on, Jen. Let’s continue our conversation elsewhere and leave Agatha to her evening.”</p><p>Blessedly, Jen followed Lilia down the hall toward Lilia’s office, leaving Agatha free to step into her own. She approached the bag behind her desk but paused there, fingers pressed to the bridge of her nose.</p><p>Rio hovered awkwardly in the doorway. “Are you okay?”</p><p>“I… yes.” Agatha sighed. “It’s just… I don’t <em>do </em>this kind of thing at work. I keep my work life and my home life separate. My colleagues barely know my last name, let alone my dating history.” Agatha groaned. “God, Jen’s going to be insufferable after this.”</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>“Why?” Agatha dropped her hand to her side. “It’s not your fault I got complacent.”</p><p>Rio winced. “Complacent? Is it so bad that they know about me?”</p><p>“You don’t understand, Rio. They met Ralph maybe… two or three times over the course of our marriage. Now they’ve met you and we’re not even in a relationship.”</p><p>“We could be.”</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “We could be in a relationship, if you wanted to be. I’m certainly not interested in dating anyone else. Are you?”</p><p>“I—no.” Agatha didn’t really understand how they’d gotten onto this topic. “Obviously not.”</p><p>“Okay. Then why don’t we make things exclusive? Is it better that your colleagues just met your new girlfriend rather than the woman you’ve been out with a few times? And so what if they barely met Ralph? It doesn’t sound like you should be comparing us to your marriage with him. What you did last time didn’t work out—maybe it’s time you changed things.”</p><p>“This has to be the worst way anyone’s ever been asked to be someone’s girlfriend.” But Agatha was stuck on that word—<em>girlfriend</em>—on the fact that Rio didn’t want to be with anyone other than her. “But I suppose you have a point. I don’t want to repeat my past mistakes. But I <em>also </em>don’t want my colleagues all up in my business. Especially when they don’t know the details of my divorce.”</p><p>“So tell them. Or don’t. But I’d really like to come and visit my hot girlfriend in her office from time to time,” Rio said, advancing the few short steps to Agatha. “And maybe do this while I’m here…” She cupped Agatha’s cheeks and kissed her softly. “So if you could be okay with that, that would be great.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, some of the tension seeping from her shoulders beneath Rio’s touch. “It isn’t my intention to hide you, Rio. I’m just not used to this.”</p><p>“Me either.” Rio’s hands slid down to Agatha’s hips. “But how about we figure it out together?”</p><p>“Okay.” Agatha was about to lean up on her toes to kiss Rio again, when Rio’s stomach gave a loud rumble. “Come on. Let’s get you some food.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">* * *</p><p align="center"> </p><p>“I am not getting on that thing.” Agatha stared at Rio’s motorcycle with her hands settled on her hips. “It’s a death trap.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes sparkled, her lips turned up into a teasing grin. “You don’t trust that I’m a good driver?”</p><p>“I don’t trust <em>other </em>drivers,” Agatha corrected. “As a general rule. At least in a car you’re more protected from other people’s idiocy. But this...” She shook her head. “No.”</p><p>“I promise I’ll go slow. And I’ll be careful.” Rio added a suggestive lilt to her words that made Agatha raise her eyebrows. “Come on. You’ll get to hold onto me the whole time…”</p><p>Agatha had to admit that made it more tempting. But… “I am not leaving Nicky without a mother.”</p><p>“I promise it’ll be fine, Agatha. And it’ll be so much easier to park than if you drive!” Rio tried to offer Agatha her spare helmet for the second time, a ridiculous pout on her mouth. “Do you want me to beg? I don’t usually, but for you I’ll make an exception.”</p><p>“Rio…”</p><p>“Fuck, I like it when you say my name like that.” Rio dragged her teeth over her bottom lip. “Like it’s a warning.”</p><p>“It <em>is</em>.”</p><p>“Please, Agatha?” Rio’s tone turned pleading, and she honest to God batted her eyelashes. “It’ll be okay. I won’t let anything happen to you.”</p><p>Agatha had a ten-year-old child at home. She was not unaccustomed to pleas, or to puppy dog eyes. It did not work when Nicky tried it—so why did she immediately want to cave into Rio’s demands?</p><p><em>Because Nicky doesn’t have you wrapped around his little finger the way Rio does</em>, a voice whispered in the back of Agatha’s skull.</p><p>She sighed. “Fine. But if you crash, I <em>will </em>kill you.”</p><p>It was worth it for the delighted smile that crossed Rio’s face as she pressed the helmet into Agatha’s hands. “You’ll love it, honestly. Here, I have a spare jacket, too. Put it on, it’ll keep you warm.”</p><p>Agatha pulled on the jacket over her own coat, zipping it under her chin and trying to ignore the way it smelled of Rio. She tied her hair up—it would be a mess by the time they arrived otherwise—and fastened the helmet under her chin, sure she looked ridiculous.</p><p>But Rio’s eyes were appraising as they took her in, admiring Agatha wearing her clothes. “You look so sexy like that.”</p><p>Agatha tapped the top of Rio’s helmet. “Get your mind focused on the road, Vidal. You promised not to crash.”</p><p>Rio lifted her hand in a salute. “Yes, professor.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, but allowed Rio to store her bag in the box on the back of the bike before they both climbed on.</p><p>Immediately, Agatha felt ill-at-ease. Just one wrong move, and they could tilt—she could be trapped beneath the bike, or they could skid off the road, or—</p><p>“Relax,” Rio said, hesitating before turning the ignition. “Just put your arms around me.” She guided Agatha’s arms around her waist, unperturbed when Agatha held on <em>tight</em>, probably squeezing some of the air from her lungs. “Ready?”</p><p>“Ready,” Agatha breathed, her chin resting on Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>Still, she wasn’t prepared for the bike to shudder to life between her thighs, for the noise of it bouncing around her skull, and she reflexively tightened her hold on Rio.</p><p>But Rio didn’t complain as she eased them out of the parking lot and onto the street lead out of Westview campus. It was clear she knew what she was doing, but Agatha still couldn’t fully relax, even as the wind started to whip through her hair.</p><p>Thankfully, their journey didn’t take them too long—Rio eased them to a stop after fifteen minutes, tucking her bike into a space on a side street in downtown Westview.</p><p>She wisely chose not to comment on the wobbly nature of Agatha’s knees as she eased herself back onto solid ground.</p><p>“There. That wasn’t so bad, was it?”</p><p>Agatha shot Rio a look as she yanked the helmet off her head. “Well, you didn’t kill me, so that’s a positive. But I don’t see how that’s an enjoyable mode of transport.”</p><p>“Cheaper to maintain than a car. Plus, it’s fun!” Rio unclipped her own helmet, her hair mussed from the wind, eyes bright and sparkling in the night air. “You didn’t enjoy it even a little bit?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Liar.”</p><p>Agatha kept Rio’s jacket on as she was led toward a nearby bar, enjoying how it felt to be draped in something of hers.</p><p>“You brought me to a dive bar?” Agatha asked as Rio pressed open the door. Inside, it was dark and crowded, the sound of raucous laughter reaching Agatha’s ears mixed with the rock music thumping through the speakers. “This is your idea of a good date?”</p><p>“It’s my idea of good food.” Rio weaved through the initial clamor of people surrounding the bar towards the back of the room, which opened out into tables and a handful of booths against the back wall. “Best burgers around in here, trust me.”</p><p>Agatha wasn’t convinced, but allowed Rio to lead her to an empty table. At least back here, the music wasn’t as loud, meaning Agatha wouldn’t have to shout to get Rio’s attention. The menu was limited, with only three burgers listed, but Agatha supposed a place like this probably didn’t have the biggest kitchen.</p><p>“You have to go to the bar to order,” Rio said, when Agatha set her menu down. “What do you want?”</p><p>“Whatever you usually have, if it’s the best.”</p><p>“And to drink?”</p><p>“I’ll let you choose that, too.”</p><p>“That’s a lot of pressure.” Rio eased herself to her feet. “You sure you trust me?”</p><p>“I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t.” Agatha caught Rio’s gaze, the words softer than she intended, but no less meaningful.</p><p>And it was worth it when Rio pressed a kiss to her lips as she passed Agatha on the way to the bar.</p><p>Left alone, Agatha scanned her eyes around the room. She was definitely overdressed—she was glad for Rio’s jacket hiding the floral blouse beneath—and at least ten years older than the patrons sitting at the other tables.</p><p>It didn’t bother her, though. She wasn’t one to feel self-conscious, and the fact that Rio was the one she was there with—that Rio had chosen <em>her</em>—was enough to make Agatha feel like she belonged anywhere.</p><p>When Rio dropped back into the seat opposite Agatha, she passed a glass of red wine across the table. “The bartender promised me it was their best.”</p><p>Agatha took a sip and tried not to wince.</p><p>Of course Rio noticed. “Ouch. That bad, huh?”</p><p>“It’s fine.” Agatha glanced at the bottle of Coke in Rio’s hand. “Not feel like a beer?”</p><p>“Not when I have a very beautiful woman to drive home after this.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow as she set her glass down, resting her hand in the palm of her hand. “And who says I’m ever getting on that bike again? Maybe I’ll get an Uber back home.”</p><p>“And miss the chance to be wrapped around me again? I’m disappointed, Agatha.”</p><p>“Or, we could <em>both</em> get an Uber,” Agatha said, daring to slip her foot out of her flats to run along Rio’s calf. “And you could wrap yourself around <em>me</em> in the backseat.” Agatha had the gratification of Rio swallowing the next sip of her drink the wrong way, spluttering as her cheeks tinged pink. “Isn’t that a much more interesting proposition?”</p><p>“It, um.” Another cough. “It sure is.”</p><p>“I like seeing you like this.”</p><p>“Like what?”</p><p>Agatha’s foot pressed harder against Rio’s calf. “Well, you’re usually so unflappable, so confident and sure of yourself… it’s nice to know I can get under your skin. Nice to know I have an effect on you.”</p><p>“You definitely do,” Rio breathed, a tremble in her fingers as she set her bottle down. “It’s all an act, you know. The confidence. I don’t feel all that put-together most of the time.”</p><p>Though Agatha had seen some of Rio’s nerves earlier that evening, the admission surprised her. “Even with your clients? Because the version of you that I saw that night at your place…” Agatha trailed off, remembering Rio’s hands all over her with a shiver.</p><p>“I told you, it’s like a performance. Like I’m playing the role of confident woman number one. But you put me in front of an attractive older woman with great hair and an even better smile and I will turn completely to mush.”</p><p>“I bet you meet loads of those.”</p><p>“No, actually.” Rio’s eyes held hers. “They’re pretty rare. But when I find one, I don’t let them go easily.” Rio reached beneath the table to catch Agatha’s ankle the next time it ascended her calf, maneuvering her foot so her heel rested between Rio’s parted thighs on her chair. Her thumbs snuck beneath the hem of Agatha’s slacks to rub at the bare skin of her own calf, and Agatha let out a breath. “But speaking of confidence… you’re coming across pretty well for someone who hasn’t done this in a while.”</p><p>Until Rio touched her.</p><p>And then every ounce of Agatha’s composure fled her body entirely.</p><p>“Maybe you’re not the only one who’s a good actress.” She managed to force the words out without moaning as Rio’s fingers moved higher up her calf.</p><p>Rio’s fingers stilled. “You feel like you have to put on an act with me?”</p><p>Okay, that had not been what Agatha had meant at all. At least, not in the way Rio had taken it. “No. Not an <em>act</em>, just… I don’t know. You <em>do </em>make me feel confident, when you look at me like that.” Rio’s ministrations resumed, kneading a knot with her thumbs. “When you touch me like that.” She swallowed, and Rio’s eyes watched her throat bob. “I guess I just have to censor myself more than usual so my first thought doesn’t come flying out.”</p><p>“Oh?” Rio’s voice had lowered. “And what’s the first thing that comes to mind right now?”</p><p>Agatha had always been good at rising to a challenge, and she leaned toward Rio over the top of the table—it shifted her foot so that for a fleeting second, it pressed to the apex of Rio’s thighs before she pulled it away, but even that fleeting contact was enough for Agatha to feel the blistering <em>heat </em>of Rio, even through her jeans. “That if you keep touching me like that, I might have to drag you to the bathroom and ask you to get on your knees for me.”</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>.” Rio’s eyes met her own, her breathing harsh and her pupils blown wide, and Agatha was <em>seconds </em>away from saying fuck it, grabbing Rio’s wrist and yanking her to her feet and—</p><p>“Hi!” A cheery voice interrupted, and Agatha turned her head, still a little dazed, to find a server standing by the side of their table balancing a plate in either hand. “I’ve got two everything burgers with fries?”</p><p>Rio was the first one to recover. “Yes, thank you.”</p><p>Agatha slid her foot back into her shoe, trying to calm her racing heart as the food was set in front of her. If only her stomach was still the only part of her that was hungry…</p><p>She shook her head and took a gulp of her terrible wine as she watched Rio shove three fries into her mouth.</p><p>“Do you always eat like that, or are you just trying to be done as quickly as possible?”</p><p>Mercifully, Rio swallowed before she answered—at least she had <em>some </em>table manners. “I like food, Agatha, what can I say. And it’s good. Try it.”</p><p>Taking a bite of her own burger, Agatha had to agree. The meat was tender, cooked to perfection, the lettuce crunchy and the burger sauce tangy on her tongue.</p><p>Rio watched her, waiting for her reaction. “So?”</p><p>“It’s passable.”</p><p>“Passable? Come on. It’s the best burger you’ve ever had, right?”</p><p>“I wouldn’t go that far, but it’s better than I thought it would be, I’ll admit.” And the fries were good, too, crispy and well-seasoned. All in all, Agatha didn’t have many complaints—other than about the wine.</p><p>Rio wasn’t as talkative when she was eating—too busy trying to clear her plate in record time—so Agatha let her attention wander, landing on the darts board over Rio’s shoulder and the couple who were playing there.</p><p>After a minute of Agatha watching, Rio turned her head to see what she was looking at. “You play?”</p><p>“Not since my college days, when I spent a lot of my time in places like this.”</p><p>“Oh, so the great Agatha Harkness wasn’t always too high and mighty to set foot in a dive bar?” Rio teased, polishing off her last two fries and then licking her fingers clean in a <em>highly </em>distracting manner.</p><p>“Twenty years ago, maybe. Now? Not so much.”</p><p>“You’re having fun though, aren’t you? Admit it.”</p><p>“Yes. But that’s more down to the company than anything else.” Rio’s pleased smile made anything even vaguely vulnerable Agatha said worth it.</p><p>“You want to play a game?” Rio asked, jerking her thumb toward another dartboard that was free. “For old time’s sake? That is, only if you can handle losing—I’m pretty good at it, if I do say so myself.”</p><p>“How do you know I’m not just as good?”</p><p>“After a twenty-year break?” Rio raised an eyebrow. “Alright. Let’s go.” Rio tossed a few notes on their table to cover the food and a tip before leading Agatha over to the board. “Shall we make it interesting? Have a little wager?”</p><p>“After you just suggested you were going to wipe the floor with me?” Rio merely wiggled her eyebrows. “Very well, then. What do you want if you win?”</p><p>Rio pursed her lips, considering as she pulled the darts free. “You let me take you down the coast on my bike.”</p><p>It wasn’t the <em>most </em>unappealing thing Rio could have said, but it was far from the least. With a reluctant sigh, Agatha nodded. “Fine.”</p><p>“And what do you want if you win?” Rio gave a few testing throws of the darts, getting her eye in—all of them nestled close to the treble twenty. She handed them over to Agatha for her to practice with a smirk.</p><p>Cocky.</p><p>Agatha had to admit it was working for her.</p><p>But she liked winning. And based on what she’d seen, Rio could probably beat her blindfolded.</p><p>Unless…</p><p>“If <em>I </em>win,” Agatha said, throwing her first one—it landed in the board, thankfully, but on a three. Nowhere near good enough. “Then you come home with me tonight.”</p><p>Well, <em>that </em>silenced Rio just fine, the smirk sliding off her face. “As in…”</p><p>“As in, I’ll let you drive me home on your ridiculous bike.” A thud as Agatha threw her next dart, this one sticking in the twelve. “Then I’ll invite you inside.” She threw her third—wincing when it landed in the one. At least she was getting closer to the twenty. “And I’ll show you the inside of my bedroom. And you can put that pretty mouth of yours to good use.”</p><p>Rio’s swallow was audible.</p><p>“So?” Agatha turned to Rio, the darts re-gathered into her hand. “Do you accept my terms?”</p><p>“I—yeah. Yeah.”</p><p>“Great.” Agatha handed the darts over. “You can go first.”</p><p>All three of Rio’s darts landed in the one.</p><p>With a laugh, Agatha turned to glance at her. “You have to <em>try</em>, Rio.”</p><p>“I am trying.” Rio blinked at her, the picture of innocence.</p><p>“To win?”</p><p>Rio’s lips quirked. “I think whatever happens tonight I’m winning.”</p><p>Agatha was rusty, but she grew into it—enough that after the first couple of rounds, Rio actually did start to try, hitting the occasional double or treble.</p><p>She still ensured Agatha won, though, missing each of the doubles she had the chance to take victory with.</p><p>“Oh no,” Rio deadpanned, as Agatha landed her elusive double five to win the game. “I lost. Whatever will I do.”</p><p>“We could always do best two out of thre—”</p><p>“Nope.” Rio cut Agatha off, and wrapped a gentle hand around her waist. “You won fair and square. Now let’s get out of here.”</p><p>“Someone’s eager,” Agatha said, smug that her plan had worked as they stepped out into the cool night air.</p><p>Rio turned to look at her, giving Agatha a once-over. “Can you <em>blame </em>me? Look at you.” She tugged Agatha close, hands dropping to her thighs. “You look incredible. This jacket might have to stay on…”</p><p>“Well, it’s definitely staying on until we get back to mine.” Agatha yanked the zipper back up to her chin. “It’s freezing.”</p><p>“I can think of a few ways to warm you up…” Rio leaned in close.</p><p>Agatha halted her progress with a hand against her sternum. “Not here, Rio.” She tapped her finger against her collarbone. “Take me home.” </p>

<p>Agatha didn’t care about the roar of the engine of Rio’s bike as she pulled to a stop outside of her home.</p><p>Fuck what the neighbors might think, if they looked outside their window and saw her dragging Rio toward her front door by her wrist. Agatha was past caring—the only thing she <em>did </em>care about was getting Rio inside as fast as possible.</p><p>Agatha fumbled with her keys at the front door, distracted by the press of Rio’s body against her back. She was blisteringly hot, her hips flush against Agatha’s ass, and Agatha groaned when Rio mouthed at the side of her neck over Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>“Fuck, Rio, I need to c-concentrate.” Her hands trembled as she fought to shove the key in the lock—she nearly dropped them entirely when Rio’s teeth grazed against her skin. There was barely any bite to it—a promise, more than anything else—but it was enough to leave Agatha thoroughly wrecked as she finally, finally, yanked her door open.</p><p>And then was promptly pressed against the wood the second it closed behind them.</p><p>Rio pinned her in place, hips against Agatha’s and her mouth meeting Agatha’s own in an open-mouthed kiss. Her tongue slid against Agatha’s, flicked against the back of her teeth, licked at the roof her mouth, filthy and heated, and it was all Agatha could do to grip Rio’s hips and match her intensity.</p><p>Rio’s own hands were everywhere—on Agatha’s shoulders, pushing at the material of her own leather jacket, before dancing down her sides, over the points of her ribs and then sliding back to grab Agatha’s ass, fingers digging into the muscle.</p><p>A shift of their hips, and Rio’s thigh slotted between Agatha’s, giving her some much-needed to pressure to grind against. It felt amazing, despite being so wet—soaked through her underwear, from a few desperate kisses—Rio’s thigh firm against her as she panted against Agatha’s hips.</p><p>“Fuck, <em>Agatha</em>.” The sound of Rio saying her name like that—whiny and needy—was almost enough to make her come. Warm lips trailed over the side of her jaw, Rio’s hands guiding the rock of Agatha’s hips against her. “You feel so good.” Rio pressed kisses down the line of her throat, breath puffing against Agatha’s skin. “If I didn’t want to take my time with you,” Rio murmured, her voice rough and breathless, “I’d take you right here against the door.”</p><p><em>God</em>.</p><p>Another jerk of Agatha’s hips brought her ever closer to the edge—she was so overstimulated, hadn’t been touched in so long, that she was sure she could come from this. From nothing more than rutting against Rio’s thigh while Rio’s tongue swirled against the frantic beat of her pulse at the base of her neck.</p><p>Agatha tangled her hands in Rio’s hair, used her grip to pull her head up, biting her lip when she saw the dazed look in Rio’s eyes, her pupils blown wide. “And if I said that’s what I wanted?” Agatha said, dragging her nails across Rio’s scalp until she heard her whine. “For you to fuck me right here? Would you?”</p><p>“<em>Yes</em>.” Rio let Agatha pull her forward, let Agatha kiss her, hard, tongue licking into Rio’s mouth. When Agatha let Rio pull back, they were both breathing hard. “But are you sure? Don’t you want it a little slower the first time?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “There’ll be time for slow later.” Reaching out, Agatha took one of Rio’s hands and pressed it against her center—even through the material of her slacks, Rio would be able to feel the heat of her. “But right now I need you to make me come before I do it myself.”</p><p>“Fuck.” Rio’s mouth settled back at Agatha’s neck, her fingers fumbling with the button of Agatha’s slacks. When they were undone, they pooled at Agatha’s feet, and she kicked them off, not caring where they ended up.</p><p>After one last bruising kiss against her collarbone, Rio sank to her knees.</p><p>Agatha had thought self-consciousness might settle in, rearing its ugly head, when they did this. She was out of practice, after all. Out of practice and all but <em>begging </em>for it, her clit throbbing in time with the beat of her heart.</p><p>And yet the sight of Rio, fully clothed, gazing up at Agatha from between her thighs, only made her feel powerful.</p><p>Wanted, for the first time in forever.</p><p>It was heady and intoxicating, and as Rio’s fingers curled beneath the waistband of her underwear (thank <em>fuck </em>she’d put on a nice pair that morning—purple lace, one of her few matching sets), Agatha felt her knees start to tremble in anticipation.</p><p>“Can I take these off?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, watching Rio’s face as she pulled her underwear off—watching the hungry look in Rio’s eyes as her focus zeroed in on Agatha’s sex.</p><p>Then warm lips were moving from her knee to the apex of her thighs, and Agatha’s eyes fluttered closed, the breath stuttering out of her. It was all she could do to remain upright, her knees threatening to give out before Rio had even properly touched her.</p><p>But Rio paused before she made contact with Agatha’s cunt, her warm breath driving Agatha insane. “What do you like?” Rio asked, lifting one of Agatha’s thighs over her shoulder.</p><p>Agatha used the leverage to lean further back against the door, stabilizing herself with the help of Rio’s left hand pressing against her hip as her right settled against Agatha’s ass. “I—well, it’s been a while,” Agatha admitted, keeping her eyes closed, because if she looked, if she saw Rio’s head between her thighs, if she was looking up at her in that hungry way, Agatha might just set on fire. “So anything will probably be enough.”</p><p>“Mm, but I don’t want to just be <em>enough</em>.” Rio pressed a bite to Agatha’s thigh, hard enough to make her groan. “So tell me. Do you like it soft?” Rio leaned in and flicked her tongue over Agatha’s clit—the contact was fleeting, but it made her gasp all the same. “Teasing?” This time, Rio’s tongue slid along the length of her to press inside her for one brief, perfect second. “Or firmer?” Rio flattened her tongue, dragging it against her clit in a rough circle that made Agatha’s eyes roll back in her head.</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>, like that. Just like that.”</p><p>With a contented hum, Rio obeyed.</p><p>Agatha dropped one of her hands to the back of Rio’s head, tangling her fingers in her soft hair. Her hips rocked against Rio’s mouth, encouraged by Rio’s hand on her ass, by the little moans Rio was making against her, the vibrations rumbling against her clit.</p><p>She could <em>hear </em>how wet she was as well as feel it, knew she must be soaking Rio’s chin but Rio didn’t seem to care. If anything, it seemed to spur her on further, tongue circling faster—and then she sucked Agatha’s clit gently between her lips and Agatha was <em>gone</em>.</p><p>Her head slammed back against the door, mouth open in a silent scream as pleasure flooded through her, making her head spin. Her knee gave out completely, and if not for both of Rio’s hands at her hips, holding her upright, Agatha would have slumped to the floor.</p><p>Rio coaxed her through the aftershocks, lapping at her gently before she pulled away, keeping her hands steady at Agatha’s hips as she climbed to her feet.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes opened, found Rio’s gaze on her face, tiny crease between her eyebrows. “You okay?” Rio asked, reaching up one hand to tuck a wayward strand of Agatha’s hair behind her ear.</p><p>“Very okay.” God, Rio’s lips and chin and cheeks were <em>glistening</em> and it made her crazy—she curled a hand around the back of Rio’s neck, tugged her in close to kiss her, tasting herself on Rio’s tongue. “Let’s move this upstairs, shall we?”</p><p> </p><p align="center">* * *</p><p align="center"> </p><p>The feeling of being skin-on-skin was even better than Agatha had imagined.</p><p>And boy, <em>had </em>she imagined it.</p><p>Rio felt perfect as she settled on-top of her on Agatha’s bed, <em>looked</em> perfect, too—all tanned skin and lithe muscle, her stomach toned and defined, dusky nipples already hard and begging to be touched.</p><p>Which Agatha was only too happy to oblige, sliding both hands between their bodies to cup Rio’s breasts as they kissed, dragging her palms against her nipples before circling them with her thumbs. Rio moaned into her mouth, her hips shifting between Agatha’s thighs, and Agatha had never felt more alive.</p><p>She wondered how many more noises she could drag from Rio before the night was through, couldn’t wait to explore every inch of that gorgeous body with hands and lips and tongue. Already, she’d spied another skull tattoo on Rio’s hip as she’d watched Rio strip out of her jeans, had wondered if there were any more hiding as Rio had slipped beneath Agatha’s sheets.</p><p>But Rio’s desire for Agatha seemingly hadn’t been sated as she pulled away from Agatha’s mouth and hands to kiss between the valley of her breasts, one hand sliding down Agatha’s hip.</p><p>And Agatha wasn’t going to complain, as Rio sucked a mark into the side of her breast before taking one of Agatha’s nipples between her teeth and swirling over it with her tongue. God, that tongue should be outlawed for the ways it could bring a woman to her knees—Agatha’s back arched into Rio as she moaned, both hands sinking into Rio’s hair.</p><p>She’d never been particularly loud in bed, but it seemed she couldn’t help it when it came to Rio.</p><p>Her hips rocked against Rio’s toned stomach, painting her skin with the evidence of her desire as Rio laved equal attention on Agatha’s other breast. “Touch me,” Agatha murmured, feeling like she might die without Rio’s hands on her. “I want to feel you inside me.”</p><p>Rio groaned against her skin, shifted to slide a hand between them, over Agatha’s thatch of soaked curls, her other arm settling beside Agatha’s head to brace her weight. She teased Agatha’s clit with the pads of her fingers before sliding lower. “How many?” Rio breathed against the side of Agatha’s neck, eyes dark as they met Agatha’s.</p><p>“Two.”</p><p>Rio nodded, leaning in to kiss Agatha as she slipped inside. She went slow—too slow, Agatha rocking up to meet her until Rio was buried to the third knuckle. They both moaned at the feeling, and then again when Rio fucked her in earnest, fast and hard, the curl of her fingers making Agatha’s hips stutter.</p><p>One of Agatha’s hands fell to Rio’s arm, feeling the muscle flexing as she sank inside her, her other hand settling at Rio’s shoulder, nails digging into her skin.</p><p>Their kisses grew messy, uncoordinated, until Rio’s head dropped to Agatha’s shoulder, panting against her skin. “You feel so fucking good, Agatha. So hot. So <em>wet</em>.”</p><p>Agatha could hear it, the slick sound of Rio’s fingers moving between her legs, feel the mess she was making on her thighs, and she was drunk on it. On the sparks that flooded through her with every curl of Rio’s fingers, with every rough slide of her palm against Agatha’s clit.</p><p>Why had she denied herself this for so long? What had she been <em>thinking</em>?</p><p>“I know you’re close,” Rio murmured, alternating between kissing and biting at Agatha’s neck. “I can feel it.”</p><p>Fuck, she was, could feel herself tightening around Rio’s fingers, drawing her in deeper. She could feel it building in her stomach—and then Rio curled her fingers as her palm rubbed over her clit and Agatha cried out in pleasure, clutching at Rio like she was her lifeline.</p><p>Rio worked her through it, pressing gentle kisses to Agatha’s cheek, and she pulled away Agatha whimpered, feeling empty.</p><p>At least until Rio pressed the length of her body against Agatha’s, sweat-slick skin meeting sweat-slick skin, and it was hard for her to feel anything but content. As her breathing slowed in time with her heartbeat, Agatha allowed her hands to roam Rio’s body.</p><p>First, she brushed her fingertips over her cheek, then her jaw and down the side of her neck before she ran her hands across Rio’s back. Her skin was soft, the muscle taut, and the soft sigh she breathed against Agatha’s neck as Agatha’s fingers skimmed her ribcage was music to Agatha’s ears.</p><p>She traced the swirling vines of Rio’s tattoo, starting on her upper arm before moving across her collarbone.</p><p>“That feels nice,” Rio murmured, shifting so that her weight rested once more on her arms, braced on either side of Agatha’s head.</p><p>“Yeah? How about this?” Agatha took advantage of Rio’s positioning to cup her breasts once more, marveling at the warm weight of them in her hands.</p><p>“Mm, more than nice.”</p><p>“And this?” Agatha trailed her lips down the side of Rio’s neck—soft at first, and then with more pressure when she felt Rio react positively to the graze of her teeth. “Or this?” Agatha shuffled down so she could take one of Rio’s nipples between her lips, teasing with teeth and tongue until Rio was breathless above her.</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>.”</p><p>Yep, that was her new favorite noise, the sweetest sound Agatha had ever heard.</p><p>“You need something, baby?” The term slipped out without much conscious thought, but the whine Rio let out made Agatha think she enjoyed it.</p><p>“Your fingers.” Rio accentuated her plea with a non-too-subtle rock of her hips. “Three.”</p><p>“Three?” Agatha curved a hand around Rio’s hip, mouth still pressed to the underside of one of Rio’s breasts, teeth working on leaving a mark behind. “Are you sure you’re ready for that?” Agatha cupped Rio’s sex, felt Rio grind against her palm, and <em>fuck</em>, she <em>was </em>ready, so wet she was practically dripping.</p><p>“Please.”</p><p>Well, seeing as she’d asked so nicely—Agatha shifted, teasing Rio with two fingers before sliding in with three.</p><p>Agatha groaned against Rio’s skin at the feeling of being inside her, slick and hot and perfect, taking her deep so easily. It had been so long since Agatha had done this, but she didn’t hesitate as she curled her fingers, knowing what Rio needed.</p><p>And Rio wasn’t holding back, either—her hips rocked to meet every one of Agatha’s thrusts, desperate and needy and moaning into Agatha’s hair as Agatha continued to suck marks into her skin.</p><p>The sound was obscene, and Agatha found her gaze drifting down, watching her fingers disappearing into Rio, marveling at the wetness coating her hand. Agatha felt drunk on the feeling, on the sheer power of being in control of Rio’s pleasure, on having a woman like this—young and beautiful and brimming with confidence—grinding against her with soft groans.</p><p>Agatha never wanted to stop.</p><p>Never wanted this feeling to end, a greater rush than she’d ever felt before as Rio gasped above her, body going taut as she pulsed around Agatha’s fingers.</p><p>Rio had barely stopped trembling before Agatha was tugging at her hips, trying to yank Rio up the bed. “I want my mouth on you,” Agatha said in response to Rio’s questioning look.</p><p>“Are you su—”</p><p>“<em>Now</em>, Rio.”</p><p>“Fuck, okay.” Still panting, Rio crawled up the length of Agatha’s body until her knees were settled on either side of her head.</p><p>Agatha allowed herself a moment to take in the sight of her, legs spread, cunt slick and glistening, mouth watering at the smell of her. She remembered how careful Rio had been with her earlier—no doubt a leftover from a job that was all about consent—and paused. She glanced up, saw brown eyes staring down at her, Rio’s forearms braced against the wall above Agatha’s headboard. “How do <em>you </em>like it?”</p><p>“You are <em>so </em>fucking sexy.” Rio bit her bottom lip, eyes burning into Agatha’s skin. “It changes, but right now I’m still a little sensitive, so soft. To start.”</p><p>Agatha could do that. She curled her hands around Rio’s thighs and tilted Rio’s hips down as she surged upwards, pressing a gentle kiss against Rio’s clit before dragging her tongue over the length of her.</p><p>Rio’s hips twitched, and Agatha dug her fingertips into her thighs as she explored every crease and fold, the taste of Rio heady in her mouth. She went slow, taking her time, finding all the spots that made Rio groan and reveling in the feeling Rio’s thighs trembling on either side of her face.</p><p>Before long, Rio didn’t want soft anymore, chasing Agatha’s tongue. But Agatha realized quickly that Rio was holding herself back, barely rocking against Agatha’s eager mouth, a line of tension in her back as she grew wetter beneath Agatha’s lips. That wouldn’t do—Agatha tried to tug Rio more firmly against her, but Rio resisted.</p><p>“Stop it,” Agatha said, pulling away from Rio to glare up at her—which was a mistake, because Rio like this? Cheeks flushed, pupils blown, hair a mess from where she’d run her own hands through it?</p><p>Absolutely devastating.</p><p>“Stop what?” Rio looked down at her, lip still ensnared between her teeth, chest heaving and beads of sweat running down the side of her neck.</p><p>“Holding back.”</p><p>“I’m not.”</p><p>“You <em>are</em>.” Agatha gave another firm tug and got absolutely nowhere—how was this woman so fucking strong? “And I don’t want you to. I want to feel how much you want me—I want you to ride my face until you come.”</p><p>Rio groaned, her head tilting back to expose the long column of her throat. “You are going to be the death of me, Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>“Good.” This time, when Agatha tugged, Rio relented, sinking down further and grinding her hips when Agatha swirled her tongue over her clit. Agatha moaned at the feeling, of having Rio at her mercy—of being at <em>Rio’s </em>mercy, hers to use to chase her orgasm.</p><p>“Better?” Rio panted, splaying her fingers flat against the well to better angle herself.</p><p>“Yes. Good girl.”</p><p>The words were muffled—Agatha was <em>not </em>taking her mouth away from Rio’s sex if she could help it—but based on the whispered curse and the particularly forceful roll of Rio’s hips, Rio seemed to have figured it out.</p><p>And Agatha was <em>definitely </em>going to be using Rio’s enthusiasm for that again in the future.</p><p>She had wondered, with Rio’s job, what she’d be like in the bedroom—whether she’d take control there as she did in her professional life, whether she’d want to be in control, or willingly hand it over, shedding that part of herself as she shed her clothes.</p><p>The thrill of knowing it was the latter—because even now, rocking against Agatha’s mouth, Rio was following the curl of Agatha’s tongue, rather than forcing Agatha where Rio wanted her—made Agatha hot all over.</p><p>When it came to sex, control wasn’t ever something she’d thought she would enjoy. In truth, she’d rarely enjoyed sex in the past—it had been perfunctory, performed only when she felt like she absolutely couldn’t put it off anymore—and certainly not enough to think too much about things she’d like to explore.</p><p>But with Rio… the sheer intoxication of having Rio above her, all around her, thighs closing around Agatha’s cheeks as she shook, her orgasm seeming to wash over her like a wave… Agatha wanted to explore it <em>all</em>.</p><p>Agatha didn’t slow the flicker of her tongue until Rio lifted herself off Agatha and collapsed onto the bed beside her, lying on her stomach with one arm flung across Agatha’s waist.</p><p>“You’re not tired already, are you?” Agatha smoothed a hand over Rio’s back. “I thought lesbians were supposed to have stamina.”</p><p>Rio lifted her head to glare at Agatha. “Oh, I have <em>plenty </em>of stamina, thank you very much.”</p><p>“Yeah? You gonna prove it?”</p><p>A hand slid down Agatha’s stomach to find her wet and wanting, and Rio did exactly that.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>“Agatha?” A hand brushed the hair out of Agatha’s face, Rio’s voice as gentle as her touch, rousing Agatha from sleep.</p><p>She blinked awake to find Rio crouching by the side of the bed, disappointingly fully dressed in the clothes she’d been wearing the night before. “Sorry, I didn’t want to wake you, but I really need to go, and I didn’t want you to wake up to find me gone.”</p><p>Agatha pushed herself so she was sitting up—the sheets pooled around her waist, baring her breasts to the cool air, and she was gratified by the way Rio’s gaze flicked to her chest, gaze turning hungry. “What time is it?”</p><p>“A little after eleven.”</p><p>“Eleven?” Agatha didn’t remember the last time she’d slept in so late without the help of a bottle wine or two. Then again, she had no idea what time it had been when she and Rio had finally succumbed to exhaustion—but the pleasant ache of Agatha’s muscles as she stretched suggested they’d been fucking for hours. “How long have you been awake?”</p><p>“Not that long.”</p><p>“But you have to go.”</p><p>Rio grimaced, which Agatha guessed meant she had a client to see after keeping her Friday night free. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>“You should have woken me up earlier.” Agatha would have liked to bask in the morning after a little longer. Maybe wrap herself around Rio’s—preferably naked—body, or indulge in breakfast in bed. Not for Rio to slink out.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t even gotten to watch her get dressed.</p><p>“But you looked so peaceful sleeping.” Rio curved a hand around Agatha’s cheek. “If I could stay I would, believe me.”</p><p><em>Then stay</em>, a petulant part of Agatha wanted to say.</p><p>But she knew she couldn’t. It wouldn’t be fair of her to ask—she didn’t want Rio to sacrifice anything just because Agatha was feeling vulnerable. “Can I see you again tonight?”</p><p>Rio’s smile was soft, thumb brushing against Agatha’s bottom lip. “I’d love to, but it’ll be late.”</p><p>“That’s okay.” Agatha didn’t care—she knew her time with Rio would be limited until Nicky’s next weekend with Ralph, and she planned to take full advantage while she could. “I can come to you this time.”</p><p>“Okay.” Rio leaned forward, lips brushing against Agatha’s, heedless of her morning breath. “About eleven? Oh, shit—you don’t have your car.”</p><p>Agatha waved a hand. “Don’t worry about that.” Wanda would happily drive Agatha to Westview to pick it up if it meant she got a debrief of their date. “I’ll see you later. Please drive safe on your death trap.”</p><p>With a chuckle—and one last, lingering kiss—Rio left. Agatha listened to the front door close, and then the hum of Rio’s engine—which was loud, <em>so </em>loud her neighbors had <em>definitely</em> heard them come back last night, and now Mrs. Hart was probably having a heart attack watching Rio speed away after spending the night.</p><p>But oh, Agatha didn’t care.</p><p>She felt alive for the first time in a long time, despite her sore muscles. Deciding she needed a shower to ease them—and to wash off the scent of sweat and sex before she even thought about stepping outside—Agatha slipped out of bed and into her bathroom.</p><p>As she soaped herself up beneath the warm spray, Agatha couldn’t help but admire the marks that littered her body, a sign of a night well spent. Rio had left imprints of her fingers on Agatha’s hips, scratches along Agatha’s thighs, and Agatha’s favorite—a litany of bite marks over her chest and on her upper thighs.</p><p>Agatha ran a cloth between her legs, wincing—she still felt sensitive, even hours later. Rio had been insatiable, bringing Agatha to the edge so many times she’d soon lost count, but Agatha knew she’d given just as good as she’d gotten.</p><p>Rio would have her own map of bruises to admire.</p><p>Once she was satisfied she was clean, Agatha shut off the spray and wrapped herself in her fuzziest robe as she reached for her phone to call Wanda.</p><p>“Hey, Agatha. Everything okay?”</p><p>“Everything’s fine.” Agatha reclined back in her bed, wondering if she should change the sheets before she left. “Are you busy today?”</p><p>“Not until tonight—we have dinner with Vision’s parents.”</p><p>“Ah yes, your monthly dinner with the in-laws.” Ralph had tried to have them do something similar, once upon a time, but Agatha had soon put her foot down. Once a month was <em>way </em>too often for her to suffer through the company of her mother-in-law. “Looking forward to it?”</p><p>“They’re not so bad,” Wanda said, but she couldn’t hide her sigh. “Why were you asking? You’re not lonely, are you? I would’ve thought Rio would be keeping you company this weekend.”</p><p>“She’s working. But I did see her last night.”</p><p>Wanda gasped. “Tell me <em>everything</em>.”</p><p>“I will. But not right now. You wouldn’t be willing to swing by and take me to campus, would you? I need to pick up my car.”</p><p>“Why would you need to—oh my god!” Wanda squealed so loud Agatha had to yank her phone away from her ear. “You went home with her last night?!”</p><p>“Can you take me or not?”</p><p>“I’ll be there in ten.”</p><p>“It doesn’t have to be—” Wanda hung up. “—right <em>now</em>,” Agatha finished, glancing down at herself—naked and with her hair wet.</p><p>Well, she’d better get ready for company.</p><p> </p><p align="center">* * *</p><p align="center"> </p><p>“Okay, <em>now </em>tell me everything,” Wanda said before Agatha even had the chance to settle herself in the passenger seat of Wanda’s car. “I want to know it all. Spare no detail.”</p><p>Agatha clicked on her seatbelt and shook her head. “There is no way I am telling you <em>everything</em>. We went out, had fun, I invited her back to mine and we spent the night together.”</p><p>“That’s it?” Wanda pouted at her, yet to put the car in back in drive. “That’s all you’re giving me?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Come on, Agatha! It’s been years since I had sex with someone new. And I’ve never been with a woman. Let me live vicariously through you.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Have you <em>thought </em>about being with a woman?”</p><p>“Well, you know.” Wanda shrugged. “In a curious sort of way. Just to see what it’s like.” Wanda finally began to drive them toward campus. “So, how was it?”</p><p>“It was amazing.” Agatha couldn’t keep the dreamy note out of her voice as she let herself remember the night before—the heat of Rio’s touch, the softness of her skin, the way she’d moaned Agatha’s name. “Everything I hoped it would be.”</p><p>“Good! You deserve that. Deserve to be happy.” Wanda tapped her fingers on the wheel as they stopped at a red light. “Okay, I <em>have </em>to ask. Did it get… you know.” She turned to Agatha to wiggle her eyebrows.</p><p>“I’m not sure I do know.”</p><p>“I mean, she’s a dominatrix, Agatha. Did she not use any of the tricks of her trade on you?”</p><p>“Wanda!” Agatha felt her cheeks heat. “I can’t believe you just asked me that.”</p><p>“What? Hey, I won’t judge if you’re into that kind of thing! I’m just interested!”</p><p>Agatha huffed out a laugh, relieved when Wanda pulled into the parking lot on campus. “<em>No</em>, it didn’t. That’s work to her, it’s not sexual.”</p><p>“I don’t know how these things work! And have you asked her that? Because maybe while she’s at work, it’s not sexual, but when she’s not…”</p><p>“Have you ever heard of not mixing business with pleasure?” Besides, Agatha was pretty sure that if Rio <em>were </em>into a dominant and submissive dynamic in the bedroom, she wouldn’t be the dominant one. Not based on the way she’d been willing to let Agatha take control last night.</p><p>Of course, that could just be because it was their first night together, and she knew Agatha was rusty. But she thought it was more than that—she remembered Rio’s reaction when Agatha had said good girl and shivered.</p><p>“I guess. When are you seeing her again?”</p><p>“Tonight.”</p><p>“So soon? God, lesbians really do move fast, don’t they?”</p><p>Agatha reached across the center console to shove at Wanda’s shoulder. “How do you even know that stereotype?”</p><p>“I read things.” Wanda grinned as Agatha shoved her again. “You look happy, Agatha.”</p><p>She tried not to squirm beneath the warm weight of Wanda’s gaze—she’d never been good at opening herself up, no matter how many times Wanda had tried to prize her apart. “Thank you. I am.”</p><p>“How much longer are you going to keep hiding this from Nicky?”</p><p>“God, I don’t know.” She leaned back against the headrest and glanced at the roof of Wanda’s car, some of the honeymoon feeling fading as she thought about the obstacles that still sat in hers and Rio’s path. “I don’t want to keep it a secret, but also… it’s only been a few weeks since Ralph and I split up, you know? To him, this will seem so fast. Add to that the fact that Rio’s a woman and someone he knows…” She shook her head. “It’s a mess.”</p><p>“Hey.” Wanda reached for her hand and squeezed. “It’s okay. You’ll figure it out, I know you will. And at least you know he already loves Rio.”</p><p>“Yeah, as his coach. Not as his mom’s new girlfriend.”</p><p>“Maybe wait until she <em>is </em>your girlfriend as a minimum.”</p><p>Agatha waved the hand that wasn’t beneath Wanda’s. “Oh, we already did that.”</p><p>“<em>What</em>?!” Wanda shrieked so loud that Agatha winced. “You kept that quiet! Since when?”</p><p>“Last night. It’s not a big deal—I’m not interesting in seeing anyone else, and neither is she. It just makes sense.”</p><p>“How romantically practical.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I’m going to go now. Thank you for the ride.”</p><p>“I think it should be Rio you thank for the—”</p><p>“Goodbye, Wanda!” Agatha pushed open the door before Wanda could fully finish that sentence, her laughter ringing in Agatha’s ears as she made her way to her own car and slid behind the wheel.</p><p>She glanced at the time—midday. Eleven whole hours to kill before she could see Rio again, and no idea of how to spend them. The rumbling of her stomach reminded her that she’d yet to eat today—at least that gave her a solid starting point.</p><p>Maybe she’d go into the center of Westview, grab lunch and do some shopping. That would whittle away the time, wouldn’t it?</p><p> </p><p align="center">* * *</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Agatha ensured she wasn’t early this time when she arrived at Rio’s home.</p><p>She did <em>not </em>want to risk running into whatever client Rio had spent her evening with. Agatha would rather live in blissful ignorance of what they might look like, didn’t need any faces to put to the mental pictures that sometimes haunted her whenever she thought about Rio at work.</p><p>Rio answered the door before Agatha had even raised her fist to knock, and she smiled but it didn’t quite reach her eyes.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Agatha asked once she was inside, frowning as she took in Rio’s expression, the tightness of her eyes and the set of her mouth as she led Agatha into her kitchen. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>“Nothing, I’m fi—” Rio cut herself off with a shake of her head as she reached for a mug of tea with trembling hands, resting her weight against the counter. “I shouldn’t lie to you. I <em>will </em>be okay, but right now not so much.”</p><p>Agatha pressed as close to Rio’s side as she could without touching her. “Do you want to talk about it?”</p><p>“It’s just my last client—”</p><p>“Did they hurt you?” Anger surged through Agatha at the mere thought, her hands clenching into fists. “Because if they did, then I’ll—”</p><p>“Down, girl.” Rio ran a hand from Agatha’s shoulder to her hand and tangled their fingers together. “No, she didn’t hurt me. Nothing like that. But this job, the headspace I have to get myself into sometimes, the things some people want me to do… it’s a lot, even if it’s not beyond the boundaries I set.” Rio sighed. “I should have told you not to come over tonight. I’m not the best company when I’m like this.”</p><p>“Do you want me to go?” It would kill her to leave Rio like this, so obviously down, but if that was what she needed, Agatha would give it to her in a heartbeat.</p><p>“No.” Rio squeezed her hand. “I’d like for you to stay. But I understand if you don’t want to.”</p><p>“I do.” Agatha pressed closer, so her and Rio’s arms were touching, the heat of her reassuring. “Is there anything I can do? What do you usually do when this happens?”</p><p>“I have an aftercare routine that I usually follow.”</p><p>“Aftercare?”</p><p>“Hmm.” Rio leaned further into her. “It’s something I do for my clients following intense activities—usually offering emotional or physical support—but I have to take care of myself, too. It’s not just them who need it, sometimes.”</p><p>“And me being here is throwing off your routine,” Agatha deduced. “Okay. So, what do you normally do?”</p><p>“I drink a cup of green tea.” Rio waved the mug held loosely in her other hand. “And I fix myself a snack, then I usually run a hot bubble bath, play music loud enough to drown out any thoughts in my head, and watch a trashy romcom in bed until I fall asleep.”</p><p>“Well, I think we can still manage all of those, can’t we?” Gently, Agatha took the empty mug from Rio. “What kind of snack?”</p><p>“My go-to is usually a grilled cheese.”</p><p>Agatha could work with that—they were one of Nicky’s favorites, so she’d fast become an expert. “Okay. Well, I’ll make you one while you go and run yourself a bath.”</p><p>Rio blinked down at her. “Are you sure?”</p><p>“Yes. Let me take care of you.”</p><p>Rio leaned down to brush her lips against Agatha with a barely-there pressure—but it was so soft, so tender, that it made Agatha ache. “Thank you,” she murmured against Agatha’s lips before she left the room.</p><p>As her footsteps sounded on the stairs, Agatha glanced around Rio’s kitchen and quickly realized she should have asked where everything was before sending her away. No matter. Rio wouldn’t have left Agatha if she didn’t mind her rooting through her kitchen cupboards.</p><p>It took her five minutes just to locate everything she needed—honestly, Rio seemed to have <em>no </em>storage system whatsoever, her cupboards were non-organized chaos—and another few to rustle up the snack.</p><p>But she was pretty happy with her attempt, the cheese melting perfectly by the time Agatha moved it onto a plate.</p><p>Mission accomplished, Agatha stepped out of the kitchen and resolutely kept her gaze away from the door down to Rio’s basement. She wondered what was down there, wondered if Rio would ever show her—wondered if she even wanted to know. Would it be better to live in blissful ignorance? Or better to <em>see</em>?</p><p>She shook her head, ascending the stairs. Agatha followed the scent of lavender to Rio’s open bedroom door. The door to her en-suite bathroom was open, but Agatha hesitated before moving towards it. She couldn’t hear the bath running, but she <em>could </em>hear the sound of trickling water which would suggest Rio had already slid into it.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“Come in.”</p><p>Agatha crossed over to Rio’s bathroom and hovered in the doorway. “Are you sure?”</p><p>“Yes, Agatha.” Rio looked more relaxed already, her head against the back of the bath, and both arms resting along its edge. Her hair was tied in a messy bun, escaped strands clinging to her neck, damp from the bathwater. “It’s not like you haven’t seen it before.” Rio glanced down at the obscene amount of bubbles in the bath. “Not that there is much to see.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, wandering to Rio’s side so she could hand her the plate. “One grilled cheese. Don’t get it soggy.”</p><p>“I’ll try my very best.” Rio had lit a few candles, and Agatha watched the shadows play across the planes of her face as their flames flickered. “Oh my god.” Rio took a bite of the grilled cheese and moaned almost as loudly as she had with Agatha’s fingers inside her. “This is amazing.”</p><p>“Glad it has your seal of approval.” Agatha raised an eyebrow as Rio demolished it in thirty seconds. “Want another one?”</p><p>“No.” She reached for Agatha’s hand after discarding the plate by the side of the bath. “Stay. Please.”</p><p>“Okay.” Agatha folded herself onto the floor beside the bath, one hand in Rio’s and the other moving to the back of Rio’s neck, kneading the muscle there like Rio had done for her the last time she’d been inside her home. “No music?”</p><p>“I’d rather talk to you.” </p><p>Rio was so sweet, so earnest, so <em>needy </em>that it made Agatha melt. She felt drunk on it as she twisted a damp strand of Rio’s hair around her index finger, listening to Rio’s soft sighs.</p><p>“That feels nice.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Mm. And that feels even better.” Agatha had run her thumb up Rio’s neck, settling beneath her ear. “Do you want to get in here with me?”</p><p>Agatha glanced at the tub—it was big, but she wasn’t sure it was comfortably big for two. Still… the thought of that casual intimacy warmed her, and she knew Rio wouldn’t have asked if she didn’t want it, too. “Okay.”</p><p>She pushed herself to her feet and tugged her T-shirt over her head, feeling the weight of Rio’s gaze on her as she stripped bare. Her expression was appreciative, but not heated, like she was just basking in the sight of Agatha’s naked body.</p><p>“You going to sit and stare or are you going to make room for me?”</p><p>“Bossy.” But Rio’s lips were quirked into a smile as she shifted to leave enough space for Agatha to slip into the water behind her.</p><p>“I think you like me bossy,” Agatha whispered as they arranged themselves—Agatha with her back resting against the tub, legs bracketing the outside of Rio’s thighs, and Rio reclining against her chest, hair tickling Agatha’s nose.</p><p>“I really, really do.” Rio relaxed against her, boneless, and Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio’s waist, content to do nothing but breathe her in.</p><p>She didn’t remember the last time she’d had a bath—and she’d certainly never had one like this. The water was warm but Rio was warmer, a furnace against her front and between her legs. Sweat beaded at the back of Agatha’s neck as they lay there, but she wasn’t complaining.</p><p>“How are you feeling?” Agatha’s lips brushed Rio’s neck as she spoke, and she felt a slow shudder ripple through Rio at the sensation.</p><p>“Better.” Rio’s hands ran over Agatha’s lower arms, still wrapped tight around her waist. “Thank you.”</p><p>“It’s okay. Thank you for sharing the way you felt with me. For letting me help you.” She felt a surge of protectiveness as she pressed a gentle kiss to the back of Rio’s shoulder. “But can we get out of here soon? I’m starting so shrivel.”</p><p>Rio snorted but obliged, hooking the plug with her foot before getting to her feet. Agatha watched the bubbles drip down her body to reveal bare skin, mouth going dry as she catalogued every single mark she’d left on Rio the night before.</p><p>A particularly wicked bruise marred the inside of her left thigh, and it took every ounce of self-control to take Rio’s proffered hand instead of pressing her mouth back to that bruise.</p><p>Agatha wrapped herself up in one of Rio’s towels while she watched Rio dry herself off and tug on a pair of boxer shorts and a tight tank top.</p><p>“Can I borrow some clothes?”</p><p>“You mean you didn’t bring any pajamas with you? I thought you were planning on spending the night.”</p><p>“I was, but I was planning on sleeping naked.”</p><p>Rio arched an eyebrow. “Far be it from me to stop you.”</p><p>“I don’t really want to watch a trashy romcom wearing no clothes, Rio.”</p><p>“Well, we don’t have to do that.” Rio stepped close, hands wandering perilously close to where Agatha had tied the towel under her arm. “I have other ideas of how to spend the evening.”</p><p>“No.” Agatha stepped back, and tried not to smile at the way Rio’s face fell.</p><p>“No?”</p><p>“Not after the day you’ve had. I don’t want you to use me as a distraction, and I don’t want to take advantage of you.”</p><p>Rio’s face softened, and this time, when she reached for Agatha, it was to wrap her hands around her waist. “I really do feel better.”</p><p>“I know.” She could tell from the way Rio’s face had relaxed, from how easy her smile rose to her mouth. “But I’m not changing my mind. Let’s watch a trashy film and cuddle until we fall asleep, and <em>maybe</em>, if you’re good, tomorrow morning I’ll make you come before I cook you breakfast.”</p><p>Rio swallowed. “Promise?”</p><p>Agatha leaned up to kiss her. “Promise.”</p>

<p>Agatha woke to find an arm slung low over her stomach, Rio’s face pressed into her shoulder, breaths warm and slow on her skin.</p><p><em>This </em>was more like it—this was how Agatha had wanted to wake up yesterday morning, their legs intertwined, basking in the warmth of another body snuggled close to her own.</p><p>A glance at the clock on Rio’s wall revealed that it was only seven thirty. Agatha could go back to sleep—she only had to be back for Nicky at four, and Rio had assured Agatha she had no plans that day—but she chose to stay awake instead, listening to the sound of Rio’s breathing as she let her hands draw swirling patterns on the skin of her lower back where her shirt had ridden up during the night.</p><p>After a few minutes, Rio stirred, and Agatha paused her ministrations—she hadn’t intended to wake her, just couldn’t resist the lure of her bared skin.</p><p>“You don’t have to stop,” a very sleepy voice murmured into Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>“Go back to sleep,” Agatha said, even as she traced her fingertips along the ridge of Rio’s spine. “It’s still early.”</p><p>“But I seem to recall you making me a promise last night.” A groan rumbled in Rio’s throat as Agatha dragged her nails back down to the small of Rio’s back. “That sounds much more fun than sleep.”</p><p>“Of course that’s the first thing on your mind when you wake up,” Agatha said around a laugh.</p><p>“<em>You’re </em>the one who was feeling me up when I was sleeping.”</p><p>“Feeling you up?” Agatha huffed, fingertips sliding teasingly beneath the waistband of Rio’s boxers to tease at the swell of her ass. “Hardly.”</p><p>“You know exactly what you were doing, Agatha.” Still with her face buried in Agatha’s neck, Rio ran a hand along Agatha’s thigh, bared by her own pair of boxer shorts that Rio had offered her.</p><p>“Will you let me freshen up first? Brush my teeth, at the very least?”</p><p>“No.” Rio kissed her neck, fingertips already inching up the inside leg of Agatha’s shorts. “No jeopardizing the beauty of sleepy morning sex.”</p><p>“But—” Agatha moaned as Rio reached higher to part Agatha with her fingertips, stroking along the length of her. She knew she wasn’t that wet—she hadn’t been awake long enough—but Rio’s touch still felt heavenly. “Give a girl a little warning first.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, I’ll warm you up.” Rio kissed her neck again, more insistent this time, teeth teasing at her skin as she drew lazy circles around Agatha’s clit.</p><p>Agatha’s hips twitched, fingers tangling in Rio’s messy hair as she kissed her way to Agatha’s chest—she tugged at Agatha’s shirt until her breasts were bared, and wasted no time in pulling a nipple into her warm mouth.</p><p>At the same time, she eased two fingers inside Agatha, thumb settling at her clit. Rio worked her up slowly, until Agatha was strung tight as a bow, unable to think about nothing but the curl of Rio’s fingers deep inside her and the delicious swipe of her tongue against her aching nipples.</p><p>Her toes curled when she came, clutching at the back of Rio’s head like it was a lifeline, her heart racing in her ears.</p><p>Rio pressed one last kiss to Agatha’s chest as she eased her fingers free—only to slip them between her lips, moaning appreciatively at the taste.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t just lie there and watch that—she pushed at Rio’s shoulder until Rio’s back was against the bed and Agatha could settle on top of her. She liked the warm weight of Rio beneath her just as much as on-top of her, liked the dark look in Rio’s eyes—still a little sleepy—as she stared up at her.</p><p>Agatha kissed her, tongue teasing at Rio’s lips before she withdrew to kiss her way down Rio’s body to settle between her thighs. Unlike Agatha, she didn’t need warming up—when Agatha tugged her boxer shorts down and Rio spread her legs, she was already glistening, all but begging for Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>And Agatha had made a promise, after all—both she and Rio moaned at the first swipe of Agatha’s tongue along the length of her. She wasn’t in the mood to tease—and Rio wasn’t in the mood to <em>be </em>teased, judging from the eager arch of her hips against Agatha’s mouth when she licked Rio’s clit.</p><p>Angling her hand beneath her chin, Agatha curled two fingers deep and sucked Rio’s clit between her lips until Rio was gasping, hips jerking against her mouth and painting Agatha’s chin with the evidence of her desire.</p><p>“See?” Rio murmured when Agatha kissed her way back up to Rio’s mouth. “Sleepy morning sex is the best.”</p><p>“It certainly has its advantages.” Agatha admired the sight of Rio—eyes closed, cheeks flushed, chest heaving, and committed it to memory incase it was a long time before she got the chance to see her like this again. “Now, I believe I also promised you breakfast, so am I allowed to get up now?”</p><p>“I’ll allow it.” Rio smothered a yawn with the back of her hand, watching Agatha clamber out of her bed.</p><p>“What do you want me to make?”</p><p>“Honestly? I don’t even know what ingredients I have in my kitchen. There might not be anything you <em>can </em>make.”</p><p>“I like a challenge.” Agatha kissed Rio’s cheek before freshening up in the bathroom. She kept Rio’s clothes on—she liked the way they felt, and that they smelled like her—and when she emerged from the bathroom Rio was still lounging in bed on her phone. “Stay in bed if you like—I’ll shout if I need anything.”</p><p>“Are you sure? I feel like I’ve invited you over to my house just to cook for me.”</p><p>“And to give you orgasms.” Agatha grinned as Rio flushed. “And it’s fine. I like doing this kind of thing.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Agatha made her way to Rio’s kitchen, humming under her breath as she rooted through Rio’s cupboards and refrigerator. Rio wasn’t kidding—things were a little desperate. But Agatha found some eggs and some ham, and along with the cheese she’d used yesterday she could rustle up an omelet.</p><p>Agatha spent some time hunting for a chopping board and a knife and muttering about how woefully understocked Rio’s kitchen was before she noticed the dishwasher tucked into the corner and wondered if that was where any missing utensils were hiding.</p><p>If they were, she hoped they were clean.</p><p>With a crow of triumph Agatha discovered that she was right—inside were three chopping boards, several plates and pans, along with cutlery including several sharp knives she could use for the ham.</p><p>And also—the frying pan clattered to the floor when Agatha noticed something else lurking on the top rack of the dishwasher. The clang of it echoed in her ears and she heard hurried footsteps coming down the stairs.</p><p>“Agatha? Are you okay?”</p><p>“Rio.” Agatha turned around to where Rio stood in the doorway, a frantic look in her eyes. “Where is there a dildo in your dishwasher?”</p><p>“Oh, shit.” Rio’s cheeks flushed <em>scarlet</em>, and she hurried over to Agatha’s side to slam the dishwasher door closed. “Can we pretend you never saw that?”</p><p>“No, I don’t think we can.” Agatha yanked the door open again, eyes fixed on the black toy. “The <em>dishwasher</em>, Rio?”</p><p>“It’s a good way to sterilize and clean silicone, okay?”</p><p>“Oh, is it?” Agatha raised an eyebrow, enjoying the mortified look on Rio’s face more than she thought possible. “I had no idea.”</p><p>“It is.” Rio rubbed at the back of her neck. “And it’s important to wash them between uses.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrow arched higher. “And just when, exactly, <em>is </em>the last time you used that?”</p><p>“Do I really have to answer that question?”</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha folded her arms. “Particularly if there was someone else involved.”</p><p>“<em>God</em>, there wasn’t.” Rio’s cheeks were so red it was a wonder she hadn’t set on fire—considering her occupation, Agatha was surprised she could get so embarrassed. “I used it on myself. Last Friday. After I, um, got back from your place.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, mouth going dry as images of Rio flat on her back on her bed, legs spread wide and toy working between her legs, short-circuited her brain.</p><p>“And I forgot to clean it right away and I didn’t think you’d appreciate seeing it on the floor by my bed so I washed it yesterday and now I wish I hadn’t.” Rio grabbed the offending item out of the dishwasher and hid it behind her back. “I’m just going to take this back upstairs and when I come down can we <em>please </em>forget this happened?”</p><p>“Or.” Agatha grabbed Rio’s hips and backed her up against the counter—she reached out to wrap her hand around the back of Rio’s where she held the toy and ran it along her upper thigh. Rio stared at her, pupils blown wide, and the shiver that ran down Agatha’s spine at the look of sheer <em>want </em>on Rio’s face nearly brought her to her knees. “You could sit and watch me cook you breakfast, and then I could bend you over the table and fuck you with this.”</p><p>Agatha could see Rio’s pulse hammering in her neck.</p><p>“F-fuck.” Rio swallowed, <em>hard</em>. “You… you’d do that? You’d want to?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t even have to think about it before she nodded. Something about being with Rio, about her looking at Agatha like that with those dark eyes, filled her with confidence, with desire, made her want things she’d never even considered before.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“D-do you want a harness?”</p><p>It hadn’t been part of Agatha’s plan—she had thought of just using her hands—but she’d never used one before, and the thought intrigued her. “Do you have one?”</p><p>Rio nodded so vigorously it was a wonder she didn’t break something.</p><p>“Okay, then. Go get it.”</p><p>The speed with which Rio obeyed, fleeing the room so fast she nearly tripped over her own feet, was its own kind of gratification.</p><p>When she returned, a leather harness dangled from her fingers, the dildo held in her other hand.</p><p>“You might need to help me but it on.”</p><p>Wordlessly, Rio crossed over to her and sank to her knees, easing Agatha’s boxers down to the floor before helping her step into the legs of the harness. The leather was cool against her skin, and Rio kissed the top of her thighs as she did up the buckles, breath hot against Agatha’s skin.</p><p>“Does that feel okay?” Rio asked when the harness was in place.</p><p>Agatha nodded—it felt odd and a little uncomfortable, but it wasn’t because it was too tight.</p><p>“This next then.” Rio slipped the end of the dildo through the ring with practiced ease—the end rubbed against Agatha’s clit as Rio settled it in place, and she groaned, already imagining what it would feel like when she slid inside Rio.</p><p>Rio looked up at her, eyes dark, before she took the head of the toy into her mouth.</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>.” The bob of Rio’s head pressed the base more firmly against Agatha’s clit, pleasure flooding through her as she tangled her hands in Rio’s hair.</p><p>But this wasn’t part of the plan—<em>she </em>was supposed to be teasing Rio, not the other way around—so, with great difficulty, Agatha tugged Rio away and tried very hard not to notice the way the toy glistened with Rio’s saliva.</p><p>“Not yet,” Agatha said, even though she was panting. “Food first.”</p><p>“While you look like that?” Rio shook her head. “Do you want to kill me?”</p><p>“Far from it.” Agatha bent to pull the boxers back up—which looked ridiculous thanks to her new appendage, but it was nothing she couldn’t pull off. “Sit down.”</p><p>Rio pouted, but did as she was told.</p><p>Agatha could feel Rio’s eyes roving over her back as she prepared them breakfast, beating the eggs and seasoning them with salt and pepper before tossing them into the pan. Once the eggs had just set, Agatha added the chopped ham and the cheese, cooking it for another minute before plating it up.</p><p>When it was set in front of her, Rio wasted no time in devouring her portion—and Agatha had no doubt about why exactly that was as she pushed her cleared plate away, eyes burning into Agatha’s from across the table.</p><p>“You really need to work on your patience.”</p><p>“I think I’ve been <em>very </em>patient, actually.”</p><p>“Do you think?” Agatha deliberately cut her omelet into tiny bites, feeling Rio all but vibrating in her chair opposite.</p><p>The <em>second </em>Agatha set her fork down, Rio whisked both plates off the table and onto the counter, before she climbed into Agatha’s lap, straddling her on the chair and throwing both arms around Agatha’s neck.</p><p>“I don’t think you’re being very patient at all.” But Agatha relented, surging up to kiss Rio, meeting her open mouth with her own. Already, Rio’s hips were restless in her lap, trying to grind against the toy even through both their boxers.</p><p>Knowing she wouldn’t get enough friction, Agatha allowed it, palming roughly at Rio’s breasts as she panted against her lips, nails digging into Agatha’s shoulders.</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>,” Rio said, in that breathy, whiny way that drove Agatha wild. “Please. I need you.”</p><p>“Yeah?” When Rio nodded, Agatha hummed. “Okay. Be a good girl and strip for me, then.”</p><p>God, Agatha loved how fast Rio was to obey her—she scrambled off Agatha’s lap, tank top already halfway over her head, and shoved her boxers down too to leave her completely bare. Agatha lifted her hips when Rio’s fingers curled around the hem of her own boxers, allowing her to tug them off before she repositioned herself, rubbing against the toy.</p><p>“Not yet,” Agatha murmured, halting Rio’s movements with a hand around her hip. “I need to make sure you’re ready first.” She already knew Rio was—could feel the searing heat of her, see the wetness on her thighs—but she wanted to tease her just a <em>little </em>more. She slid a hand between Rio’s thighs, biting her lip when she felt how soaked she was. “Fuck, Rio.”</p><p>“I told you.” Rio rocked her hips into Agatha’s hand as she cupped her. “I need you.”</p><p>Agatha ground her palm against Rio’s clit just to hear her gasp, before pulling away. She wrapped her hand around the head of the toy, rubbing teasingly against Rio’s clit until she was gasping, and only then did Agatha move lower.</p><p>Rio rocked down, taking in the first inch and moaning into Agatha’s hair. Agatha let her hands rest on Rio’s hips, feeling her sink down until she bottomed out, her hips flush against Agatha’s.</p><p>“You feel so good inside me,” Rio murmured, hips starting to grind, and Agatha wished she could feel it—imagined how Rio would feel, hot and wet and squeezing around the length of her. “So fucking good, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, pressing her mouth to the side of Rio’s neck to sink her teeth into her skin as her hips rocked faster, her hands resting on the back of Agatha’s chair to support her weight.</p><p>Rio’s moans echoed around the room as she moved, and Agatha glanced down, watching as Rio raised and lowered her hips, watching the toy disappear inside of her, watching the wetness shining along its length, and couldn’t stand it anymore—Rio was moving too slowly, and Agatha needed to watch her <em>shatter</em>.</p><p>“Stop.” She wrapped her hands around Rio’s hips to still her—which she did immediately, blown pupils staring down at Agatha in confusion. “Stand up, and turn around.”</p><p>Rio’s throat bobbed as she swallowed, scrambling off Agatha’s lap and turning to face her kitchen table. She leaned over it, bracing her elbows against the wooden surface and spreading her legs wide, and Agatha’s mouth watered at the sight of her dripping cunt, begging for Agatha to fuck her.</p><p>The legs of Agatha’s chair scraped against the floor as she climbed to her feet, standing behind Rio and positioning the toy at her core. “Ready?” She murmured, leaning forward to press a kiss to the back of Rio’s shoulder, tongue tasting the salt on her skin.</p><p>“Yes.” Rio rocked back against her. “Please.”</p><p>Agatha pressed forward, sinking into Rio until her hips were flush against Rio’s ass, and both the sound of the toy moving inside her and the noise that left Rio’s lips were obscene. It only spurred Agatha on, her hands wrapping around Rio’s hips as she began to fuck her in earnest. Each rock of her hips rubbed the base of the toy against her clit, pleasure sparking through her body and making her fuck into Rio harder, encouraged by Rio’s breathless cries of her name.</p><p>She was beautiful, and she was perfect, and when Agatha saw Rio slide a hand between her own legs to circle her clit, it tipped her over the edge, her hips spasming and her core pulsing around nothing and then Rio was coming too, her whine high-pitched as she collapsed against the table, completely spent.</p><p>Agatha followed suit, draping herself across Rio’s back and kissing every bare inch of skin she could reach without moving too much, still buried to the hilt inside her. “Are you okay?” Agatha said, Rio’s breathing loud and her heart pounding beneath her ribcage—Agatha could hear it where her cheek was pressed to Rio’s spine.</p><p>“I’m perfect.” Rio straightened up, letting out a harsh breath when the toy slid out of her, and turned in Agatha’s arms to kiss her breathless. “So, how much longer do I have with you before you have to go home?”</p><p>Agatha glanced at her watch. “I’ve got another hour or two.”</p><p>“Okay.” Rio’s hands reached for Agatha’s hips, playing with the buckles of the harness. “Long enough for me to fuck you?”</p><p>Agatha thought of Rio inside her, wrapped around her, and felt her mouth go dry. “Yes, please. Though maybe in bed?” Agatha could feel an ache in her back and in her hips, didn’t want to not be able to walk tomorrow if she let Rio bend her over the table or the kitchen counter. “I’m not as young as I used to be.”</p><p>“Age is just a number, Agatha,” Rio said seriously. “But sure.” She stepped back, taking Agatha’s hand and tugging her towards the stairs. “I don’t care where we are as long as I get to make you come.”</p>

<p>Agatha made it home with fifteen minutes to spare before Ralph was due to drop Nicky off.</p><p>Enough time to blow-dry her hair, damp from the shower she’d taken with Rio before leaving, and exchange the clothes she’d stolen from Rio to drive home in for some of her own, eager to avoid any unwanted questions.</p><p>The knock came at four p.m. sharp, and Agatha smiled when she opened the door to Nicky’s smiling face. He wrapped his arms around her waist before bounding inside, no doubt to check on Senor Scratchy after leaving him with Agatha for the weekend.</p><p>“Any problems?” Agatha asked, when Ralph handed over Nicky’s overnight bag.</p><p>“None at all. I—” Ralph frowned, gaze sharpening as he glanced at Agatha’s neck. “Is that a hickey?”</p><p>Fuck. Agatha had thought her hair would cover the worst of it—Rio had been <em>enthusiastic </em>in her ministrations when she’d realized how sensitive Agatha was there, and Agatha had enjoyed it far too much to tell her to stop. She yanked the collar of her shirt up higher. “That’s not really any of your business, Ralph.”</p><p>“I guess not.” His frown smoothed out and he forced a smile. “Things are going well with your mystery man, then?”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, before she glanced over her shoulder. Nicky was nowhere in sight, but she could hear him cooing over the rabbit from the direction of the kitchen. He’d be preoccupied for another few minutes, at least.</p><p>“Actually, Ralph…” Agatha turned around and took a deep breath, knowing she’d need to bite the bullet sooner rather than later. He was going to find out about Rio one day—better to rip off the BandAid now. If he took it badly, she could just shut the door in his face. “It’s um, not a man at all. I’m dating a woman.”</p><p>“Oh.” Ralph blinked, rocking back on his heels, before he nodded. “You know, that actually makes a lot of sense.”</p><p>“It… it <em>does</em>?”</p><p>“Yeah.” He laughed, reaching up to run a hand through his graying hair. “You know, sometimes when I was checking out a hot woman I’d look at you to see if you’d noticed and find you checking her out, too.”</p><p>Agatha forced her mouth not to drop open in shock.</p><p>“You could’ve told me, you know.”</p><p>Biting her lip, Agatha tried not to let a sudden wave of guilt drown her. “I didn’t want to admit it to myself, never mind anyone else,” she said, keeping her voice quiet. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>“Hey, it’s okay.” Ralph reached out to squeeze her shoulder. “Neither of us were angels in our marriage. Honestly, neither one of us should have let out parents push us together—but I don’t regret it. Can’t, when we got our boy out of it.”</p><p>Agatha felt the same way. She wished things could have been different, but if she could go back, she wouldn’t do anything differently if it would mean Nicky was no longer in her life.</p><p>“I’m also not going to stand in the way of your happiness, Agatha. I’m intending for us to get this divorce done as amicably as possible, because Nicky is the most important thing in the world to me. I know I haven’t always been the best father, but I want to step up now in whatever time I get with him.”</p><p>“I’m glad to hear that, Ralph.”</p><p>“And if you want to introduce this woman to him… you have my blessing.”</p><p>“You don’t want to meet her first?” Agatha wasn’t sure she would offer the same courtesy, were their positions reversed.</p><p>Ralph shrugged. “One day, sure. But I know you wouldn’t bring someone into his life unless you trusted them completely. That’s enough for me.”</p><p>“Thank you, Ralph.” Never in a million years did Agatha think that they’d got along better as divorcees than as husband and wife, and yet it looked like that was where their relationship was heading. “I appreciate that.”</p><p>“You’re welcome. Well, I’ll leave you to your evening.” Ralph dug his hands into the pockets of his jacket. “See you soon, Nicky!”</p><p>“Bye Dad!” Nicky called back.</p><p>Once Ralph was gone, Agatha closed the front door and padded into the kitchen to watch Nicky pet Senor Scratchy, who had curled up in his lap. “Did you have a good weekend, Nicky?”</p><p>“Yeah, it was cool. Dad took me to a baseball game yesterday.” Nicky scratched behind the rabbit’s ears and glanced up at Agatha. “I missed you, though.”</p><p>“I missed you too, sweetheart.” Agatha bent down to kiss the top of his head. “But I’m glad you had fun.” She hesitated, drumming her fingers on the kitchen counter. “How do you feel about me and your dad not being together anymore?”</p><p>It was a topic she’d been careful to stray away from, for the most part, trusting that his therapist would work him through any issues—and maybe not wanting to hear his answers, not wanting to feel that gnawing guilt at the thought of taking his family unit away, raising him in a broken home.</p><p>But that was selfish, and she couldn’t shy away from the emotion of it all if she was going to raise him to be emotionally well-adjusted—more so than Agatha had been, anyway.</p><p>Nicky shrugged. “It’s weird, but…” His eyes darted up to meet Agatha’s. “You both seem happier now. You actually talk to each other instead of arguing. Mandy says it’s not my fault and sometimes relationships don’t work out and there’s nothing that can be done to fix them.”</p><p>“Of course it’s not your fault, Nicky.” Agatha folded herself to the floor beside him, letting him lean his back against her chest. “And you know that we both love you lots, right?”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>He let her hold him for a while longer—perhaps sensing that she needed it more than him—before wiggling out of her grip. “Can we have dinner soon? Dad still can’t cook, and Grandma’s food always tastes weird.”</p><p>“That will be the amount of oil she cooks everything in.” Agatha shuddered at the memories of too many dinners forcing down mouthfuls of terrible food. “But of course. How do fajitas sound?”</p><p>“Awesome!”</p><p> </p><p align="center">* * *</p><p align="center"> </p><p>When Agatha slid beneath her sheets later that evening, she realized that they still smelled like Rio.</p><p>Or that could also be the shirt Agatha was wearing—the soft tee she’d stolen from Rio’s closet earlier that afternoon. She breathed in deep, wishing more than anything that Rio was stretched out beside her.</p><p>Not even for sex—though Agatha had absolutely <em>no </em>complaints about Rio’s prowess in that area, muscles still aching pleasantly from their weekend together—but just for the warmth of her, the curl of her arm around Agatha’s waist, the soft cadence of her sleepy breaths against Agatha’s neck.</p><p>Past Agatha would have thought of such emotion as a show of weakness, would have never imagined feeling something so deep so quickly. It should have terrified her and yet… she found herself reaching for her phone and typing out a message to Rio.</p><p>
<em>I miss you. </em>
</p><p>Less than thirty seconds later, Rio was video calling her. “You miss me, huh?” Rio answered, a soft smile on her face. Like Agatha, she was lying in bed, head propped up on her pillows. “You only saw me a few hours ago.”</p><p>“I know. But then I got into a bed that smells like you, and I wish you were here with me.”</p><p>“I wish I was there with you, too.” Rio’s soft words made Agatha’s heart swell with warmth. “How was the rest of your day? Is Nicky okay?”</p><p>“Nicky’s fine.” Agatha rolled onto her side, resting her phone on the pillow Rio had slept on on Friday night. “He had fun with Ralph. And speaking of Ralph… I actually told him. About us.”</p><p>Surprise rippled across Rio’s features. “You did?”</p><p>“Well, I didn’t say it was <em>you</em>, Nicky’s soccer coach and possibly the woman he called to book his dominatrix appointments with, specifically, but I told him I was dating a woman.”</p><p>“And how’d he take it?”</p><p>“Really well, actually.” Agatha worried at her bottom lip. “He even gave us his okay to tell Nicky.”</p><p>“Wow.” Rio shifted, sitting up to press her back against the headboard. Agatha was momentarily distracted by the flash of skin the movement reveled—Rio’s tank top neckline was low, and it revealed the purple and green bruises Agatha had left in her wake over the weekend. “Is that something you want?”</p><p>“What I want is to not feeling like we’re sneaking around. What I want is to not have to second-guess how I interact with you at soccer practice or games. What I want is to be able to have you here in my bed without worrying about who might see.” Agatha took a breath. “But… is that something <em>you </em>would want? I know dating a single mother isn’t exactly glamorous.”</p><p>“I knew what I was signing up for, Agatha.” Rio’s eyes twinkled with amusement. “Nicky hasn’t exactly come as a surprise. Technically, I knew him before I knew you.”</p><p>“Still.” Agatha knew the <em>theory </em>of involving a child in their relationship and the practicalities were two very different things. “It’s a lot.”</p><p>“It is,” Rio acknowledged. “But I want all of those things, too, Agatha. I want all parts of you—including the single mom. Including Nicky. He’s a great kid, and I’d love to spend more time with him if that’s something you’d be comfortable with.”</p><p>Agatha thought of what she’d seen of Rio with Nicky—and how Nicky lit up whenever Rio spoke to him. Thought of weekends curled up on the couch with Rio on one side and Nicky on the other. Cheering Nicky on from the sidelines and going out to celebrate with both him and Rio after a game. “It’s absolutely something I want, Rio. I just… I don’t know how to tell him,” she admitted. “To him, Ralph and I haven’t been over for all that long. Add to that the fact that you’re a woman <em>and </em>his soccer coach who he loves… it’s complicated.”</p><p>“I know.” Rio worried at her bottom lip with her teeth. “How about if we started hanging out together more? Just as friends—to him—for now. Build it up that way? So it’s more of a transition for him?”</p><p>“I think that sounds like a really good idea.”</p><p>“Maybe… we could start this week? After practice one night? I don’t want to wait until his game to see you again.”</p><p>Agatha was so relieved that Rio was as invested in this as she was. “How about Wednesday? I’ll pick him up and we can get dinner?”</p><p>“It’s a date.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">* * *</p><p align="center"> </p><p>“Hey.” Agatha knocked Wanda’s shoulder with her own when she arrived at soccer practice to find Wanda already on the sidelines.</p><p>“Hey yourself.” Wanda had her hands dug into the pockets of her jacket to ward off the chill in the air. “You’re only here to ogle your girlfriend, aren’t you?”</p><p>“No.” Agatha waved at Nicky as he glanced toward her. “I’m here to support my son.”</p><p>“Uh-huh.”</p><p>Agatha’s attention wandered—briefly—to Rio, who grinned when their eyes met, her breath visible in the air as she jogged along the side of the field.</p><p>Wanda poked Agatha’s cheek. “You’re drooling.”</p><p>“I am <em>not</em>.” Agatha was not prepared for Wanda to be so insufferable about this. “But if I was… would you blame me?”</p><p>“Honestly?” Wanda’s own gaze flickered over to where Rio was demonstrating penalty kicks. “No.”</p><p>“The reason I’m <em>really </em>here though is because we’re going out for dinner after practice. The three of us.”</p><p>“Oh?” Wanda turned to face her, one eyebrow raised. “That’s a new development.”</p><p>“He doesn’t know we’re together.” Agatha cheered when Nicky’s practice penalty kick flew into the back of the net—he ran over to Rio to give her a high-five. “But we thought that maybe if we started hanging out together a bit more it might make it a little easier for him to take.”</p><p>“Not a bad idea.” Wanda smiled as Billy’s attempt hit the back of the net, too. “Though for the record, I think he’s already smitten with her.” Nicky had stayed near Rio, chattering away to her as they watched Tommy step up to the penalty spot.</p><p>“Hopefully he still feels the same way once he knows her as my girlfriend, and not just his coach.”</p><p>“It’ll be fine, Agatha.” Wanda squeezed her shoulder. “When am I going to officially meet her, anyway? Are you hiding her from me on purpose?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Wanda’s mouth opened. “Why?!”</p><p>“Because you know too many embarrassing stories about me. And god knows what you’ll say to her.”</p><p>“I won’t say anything to her!”</p><p>“Oh, so you won’t interrogate her? Ask her what her intentions are?” Agatha wiggled her eyebrows. “I know you, Wanda. I’m not letting you scare her off.”</p><p>“Please. If she can’t handle me, then she doesn’t deserve you. And I won’t scare her off—I’ll be on my best behavior, I promise. Why don’t we go out for dinner soon? Me and Vis, and you and Rio?”</p><p>It wasn’t a bad idea. And it had been a long time since she’d spent any time with Wanda without the kids. “I’ll ask her.”</p><p>“Yay!” Wanda wrapped her in a hug. “Oh, it’s going to be so fun. Wait. Can I tell Vision about you two now? I haven’t said anything to him yet because I wasn’t sure if you wanted me to.”</p><p>Agatha was touched. “I think you probably better had before you officially meet her.” </p><p>“Okay. And don’t worry—he’ll be on his best behavior, too.”</p><p>It was <em>not </em>Vision that Agatha was worried about.</p><p>Rio blew the whistle to signify the end of practice, and Nicky raced over to her side. “Mom, can Billy and Tommy come with us for pizza?”</p><p>“Um…” Having an extra two children along would put a serious dampener on Agatha’s plans for the evening.</p><p>Luckily, Wanda came to the rescue. “Sorry, Nicky, not tonight. These two have a history project to finish.”</p><p>The twins both groaned; Agatha was glad she’d forced Nicky to finish his own project the previous evening. She couldn’t have her boy falling behind in her specialist subject, after all.</p><p>“Come on, boys, let’s go. See you soon Agatha! Hope you enjoy your pizza, Nicky.” With a wave, Wanda dragged Billy and Tommy to the parking lot.</p><p>“Hey.” Agatha crouched in front of a pouting Nicky. “I’m sorry the boys couldn’t join us, but… how would you feel about asking Coach Vidal to come with us, instead?”</p><p>Nicky’s eyes widened. “Seriously?”</p><p>“Yes. She’s spending so much time with you—I’d like to get to know her better.” Agatha pointed toward where Rio was gathering up the last of the soccer balls they’d used in practice. “Do you want to go and ask her?”</p><p>“Okay!” He raced away without another word and Agatha watched him go, a smile on her face.</p><p> </p><p align="center">* * *</p><p align="center"> </p><p>They drove separately to the restaurant, and Agatha and Nicky arrived first.</p><p>Settling into a booth beside Nicky, waiting for Rio to join them, Agatha felt nerves somersaulting through her stomach. What if this went badly? What if Nicky didn’t like Rio outside of the soccer field? Worse—what if Nicky guessed that Agatha had ulterior motives for inviting Rio to eat with them? What if he—</p><p>“Hey.” Rio slid into the booth opposite them. She’d changed from her sweatpants and hoodie combination into a pair of black jeans and a floral blouse that looked more like it had come from Agatha’s closet than Rio’s. “Thanks for inviting me to join you.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes met Agatha’s, one of her eyebrows raising when she noticed Agatha’s expression—and no wonder, if her spiraling emotions were written all over her face.</p><p>“You’re welcome. It’s nice to have an opportunity to get to know you better,” Agatha said, forcing her voice to remain level when Rio’s foot brushed against her calf beneath the table. The gesture was probably supposed to be comforting, but all it did was make her ache.</p><p>“Did you enjoy practice today, Nicky?” Rio asked as she reached for her menu. She’d painted her nails a dark red since Agatha had last seen her, and she couldn’t help but wonder what that shade would look like, digging into her pale skin.</p><p>Something she should absolutely <em>not </em>be thinking about while sitting next to her son.</p><p>“Yeah!” Nicky’s voice was bright with enthusiasm. “I like penalties.”</p><p>“Well, you’re very good at them.” Apparently already decided on her order, Rio set her menu down and smoothed a hand over it to fold it shut.</p><p>Nicky’s cheeks flushed scarlet. “Thanks, Coach Vidal.”</p><p>“How about you call me Rio when we’re not at practice?” Rio spoke in a softer voice when talking to Nicky, making sure to look him in the eye. “I’m not your coach in here.”</p><p>“Okay. Rio.” He sounded like he was testing it out on his tongue. “Did you used to play soccer? Is that why you’re so good at it?”</p><p>“I did when I was in college, but then I got hurt and had to stop.”</p><p>Nicky’s eyes widened. “Do you still hurt now?”</p><p>“Not during our practices,” Rio assured him. “But it does mean I can’t play myself anymore. I have to settle for watching it, instead. Though I prefer watching women’s soccer to men’s—I just think the NWSL is better.”</p><p>“What’s the NWSL?”</p><p>Rio’s mouth dropped open in horror. “You don’t know what the NWSL is?” Her gaze flickered toward Agatha as she shook her head. “How has your mother not educated you on the National Women’s Soccer League?”</p><p>“His mother has little interest in watching people kick a ball around a field, regardless of their gender,” Agatha said, refusing to be cowed by Rio’s look of mock disappointment. “Blame his father for his lack of education on the matter. Or Vision—it’s <em>his </em>fault Nicky plays it in the first place.”</p><p>Rio’s lips quirked into an amused smile. “Ah, so you’re passing the blame.”</p><p>“I didn’t know women had professional teams, too!” Nicky looked overjoyed by the prospect. “Have you ever been to a game?”</p><p>“I have.”</p><p>Nicky looked impressed.</p><p>“I’m actually planning on attending one of the playoff games next weekend—Gotham FC are through to the quarterfinals and their stadium isn’t too far away.”</p><p>“Cool!” Nicky’s eyes widened before he turned to Agatha. “Mom, can we go too?”</p><p>“Uh…” The thought of sitting through two hours—plus travel time—of soccer did not sound appealing. And yet… she struggled to deny Nicky anything. And if it was another opportunity for him and Rio to spend some time together, wasn’t that a good thing? “We can certainly look into it.”</p><p>“There’s still tickets left.” Rio propped her chin on her hand. “If I ask my friends nicely, they might even let you guys take theirs so we can sit together.”</p><p>As nice as that would be—“I wouldn’t want to impose.” Or have Rio’s friends think badly of her. “Not if you already have plans.”</p><p>Rio waved a hand. “It’s fine, honestly—Alice and William won’t mind getting seats together somewhere else.”</p><p>Well, at least Agatha already knew those friends. Alice would probably give Rio a high-five. “Are you sure?”</p><p>“Yes.” Rio’s smile was warm. “I’d love to take Nicky to his first NWSL game. And who knows—maybe you’ll love it, too.”</p><p>Agatha was pretty sure she would—but because of Rio’s company, rather than anything to do with the supposedly beautiful game. “Okay.”</p>

<p>“They’re here!” Nicky announced from where he’d had his face pressed against the window that looked out onto the street—he’d been there for at least twenty minutes, despite Agatha insisting that Rio wouldn’t be there that early. “Let’s go, Mom!”</p><p>Agatha allowed herself to be pulled out of her house and down her drive, to where an SUV was idling by the curb.</p><p>Behind the wheel, Alice lifted her hand in a wave, and Agatha wondered, not for the first time, if travelling to the stadium with Rio and her friends was such a good idea.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t know where she was going, and Nicky had wanted to see Rio, and Rio had assured Agatha that both Alice and William—who was in the passenger seat—would be on their best behavior.</p><p>The backdoor of the SUV was pushed open, revealing Rio—she shuffled over to the opposite seat and beckoned Nicky and Agatha inside. “Hi, Nicky. Hi, Agatha,” Rio said, as both mother and son got themselves situated. “These are my friends, Wiliam and Alice.”</p><p>“Hi.” Nicky ducked his head, bashful on his first meeting with strangers—until he warmed up to them, at least.</p><p>“It’s nice to meet you both,” Agatha said, like she had not, in fact, spent an hour in a dusty lecture theatre with them both just over a week ago.</p><p>“Nice to meet you both, too.” Alice smirked at Agatha in the rearview mirror. “So, Nicky, are you looking forward to the game? Rio tells us it’s your first.”</p><p>“Yeah, I’m excited. I won’t know any of the players, though.”</p><p>“That’s okay.” William turned to glance at Nicky from the front of the car. “I haven’t been to many games, either—it’s fun even if you don’t know what’s going on.”</p><p>“Nicky knows the <em>rules</em>, William,” Rio said, with a fond roll of her eyes. “I coach him, remember?”</p><p>“Hey, I haven’t seen you coach.” William’s eyes twinkled with amusement. “You might have no idea what you’re doing.”</p><p>Rio leaned forward to swipe him on the back of the head.</p><p>“No violence with a kid in the car!” William protested, jerking forward to escape Rio’s reach.</p><p>“Violence is allowed if it’s to defend my honor as a coach.” Unable to get her hands on William, Rio settled for a threatening glare.</p><p>“Rio’s the best coach,” Nicky said, his voice more confident than it had been since getting in the car. “She knows all the rules.”</p><p>“See?” Rio’s gaze turned smug, and Agatha tried really, really hard not to think about how much she enjoyed that look on her. “I’m the <em>best </em>coach. It’s not <em>my </em>fault you don’t listen when I try to explain the offside rule to you.”</p><p>William sighed. “There’s just too many rules, Rio. You can’t expect me to remember them all.”</p><p>“Uh, I can, actually.” Rio leaned her shoulder against the car window. “Remind me why you even come to these games, again?”</p><p>“Because it’s fun! And you know I have FOMO. You and Alice can’t hang out without me.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, but she was smiling—it was clear she loved both William and Alice, and Agatha was glad that, considering she had no blood family, she seemed to have made a family of her own.</p><p>“I should thank you both for giving up your seats for me and Nicky,” Agatha said, as Alice pulled onto the interstate. “We appreciate that.”</p><p>“Oh, it’s fine.” Alice met Agatha’s gaze in the mirror again. “Rio bought us both several rounds of drinks last night to make up for the inconvenience.”</p><p>“She sure did,” Rio said. “My bank account is definitely feeling it this morning.”</p><p>“As is my head,” William added. “On second thought, maybe this game wasn’t actually such a good idea…”</p><p>“Well, I’m not turning around now,” Alice said. “But there’s aspirin in the glovebox if you need any.”</p><p>As they drove, Agatha watched out of the window, content to listen to the bickering of Rio, William and Alice, interjected with the occasional question from Nicky. He relaxed as the miles ticked by—even joining in with some playful ribbing of William calling half-time “the interval”—with the help of Rio always making an effort to include him in the conversation.</p><p>William and Alice were both good with him, too, asking questions and coaxing answers from him in a way that made Agatha’s heart swell with gratitude.</p><p>The drive took a little over an hour, and Alice parked in a side street a little way away from the stadium. The five of them piled out and fell into step with the other people going to watch the game, recognizable in their Gotham jerseys.</p><p>Rio and Alice wore their own, the collars peeking out beneath the leather jackets they both wore, and Agatha wondered if she should have worn the team’s colors, rather than a navy blue sweater and jeans.</p><p>No matter—if she kept on her coat, no one would know the difference.</p><p>She held Nicky’s hand as the crowd grew larger, not wanting to lose him. Rio stayed close on Nicky’s other side, Alice and William walking a few steps behind them.</p><p>“I think we’re going in a different entrance,” Alice said as the Red Bull Arena came into view. “We’ll meet you back by the car after the game?”</p><p>“Sure.” Rio allowed herself to be pulled into a hug. “See ya later!”</p><p>“Hope you two enjoy the game!” With one last wave, Alice and William headed for the arena.</p><p>Rio led them in the opposite direction, careful to keep one hand on Nicky’s back as they weaved through groups of people.</p><p>Agatha didn’t remember the last time she’d been in a crowd like this. She had never attended a sports game before, hadn’t been to a concert since she was in her twenties—and had to admit she found it overwhelming, her hand gripping Nicky’s a little too tight.</p><p>Of course Rio noticed her anxiety. “You okay, Agatha?”</p><p>“I—yes. It’s just busy. More so than I expected.”</p><p>Rio grimaced. “Yeah, sorry, I should have warned you—playoff games draw a big crowd. It’ll be better once we get inside, I promise.”</p><p>To Agatha’s relief, Rio wasn’t wrong—while people milled around inside the stadium concourse, they weren’t as tightly packed as they had been while queueing to enter.</p><p>“I usually get drinks and snacks before finding my seat,” Rio said, jerking her thumb toward a nearby stand. “You guys want anything?”</p><p>Nicky glanced toward Agatha. “Can I, Mom?”</p><p>“Of course, sweetheart.” Agatha wanted him to have the full game day experience, after all. She let Rio walk them over to the stand and order them all a hot dog and a soda before taking them to their seats.</p><p>Agatha felt a lot more settled once she could sit down, Nicky in between her and Rio, staring down at the pitch with wide eyes and ketchup on his chin.</p><p>Agatha met Rio’s gaze over Nicky’s head. “Thank you for inviting us today.”</p><p>“It’s not a problem.” Rio’s tongue licked ketchup from the corner of her mouth, and Agatha struggled not to zero in on it, remembering what that tongue had felt like between her thighs and squeezing her legs together. “You want a run down of the players to look out for, Nicky?”</p><p>“Okay!”</p><p>Agatha listened to Rio point at some of the women warming up on the pitch below them, content to hear the lilt of Rio’s voice.</p><p>When the game kicked off, Agatha followed the action as best as she could—knowing the right places to groan or clap thanks to Rio’s and Nicky’s reactions. But after a while, just like at Nicky’s games, Agatha’s attention wandered over to Rio. To the way she raised her fist to cheer a good challenge or shot on goal, to her slapping her knee in frustration when a decision didn’t go Gotham’s way.</p><p>She was beautiful, the sun catching the lines of her face, her hair pulled back into a messy bun at the back of her head, her cheeks red from exertion and her eyes sparkling in the afternoon light.</p><p>When Gotham scored the first goal of the match after thirty minutes, Agatha found herself on her feet along with the people around them—and then wrapped in a warm hug with Rio, Nicky sandwiched in between them.</p><p>It was fleeting, Rio’s hands blisteringly warm on the small of her back for mere seconds, but it was enough for Agatha to melt into the touch, bask in the feeling of having two of her favorite people so close, getting on so well—she’d been so worried about how Nicky would take this thing with Rio, but if it was more weekends like this, the three of them together, having fun, how could it be anything other than perfect?</p><p><em>Want </em>pulsed through Agatha as Rio stepped away, settling back into her seat as the game restarted. But not just want for Rio—want for more of <em>this</em>, want for more moments together, want to keep seeing Nicky leaning in close to whisper in Rio’s ear, her face lighting up as she laughed at whatever he said.</p><p>Agatha didn’t know how much longer she could keep this thing a secret.</p><p>She almost blurted it out to Nicky then and there—and only the knowledge that that would be a <em>terrible </em>idea had her biting her tongue.</p><p>Soon, she promised herself, catching Rio’s eye again.</p><p>Soon, she’d be able to tell him, and soon, she and Rio wouldn’t have to worry about holding themselves back in public, and soon, Agatha would have everything she’d ever wanted, grasped firmly in the palm of her hand.</p><p> </p><p align="center">* * *</p><p align="center"> </p><p>“You want a hand getting him inside?” Rio waved toward where Nicky was fast asleep, eyes closed and his head resting on Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>Clearly, the excitement of a penalty shootout, followed by dinner with Rio, Alice and William, had taken it out of him—he’d passed out before they’d even gotten on the interstate back to Westview, and slept the whole journey home.</p><p>“You just want an excuse to be invited inside.” Alice snickered from the front seat, and Rio glared at the back of her head.</p><p>“Alice!”</p><p>“What?” Alice rolled her eyes. “He is <em>asleep</em>.”</p><p>“He still has ears.”</p><p>“<em>Sleeping </em>ears,” Alice muttered.</p><p>“Some help would be wonderful,” Agatha said. “And stay for a drink?”</p><p>“Oh, I’m sure she’ll stay for more than a—”</p><p>“Alice!” Rio hissed, though Nicky had yet to stir. “Do not finish that sentence.”</p><p>“Being in a relationship has made you so boring,” Alice said. “We won’t wait for you—you can make your own way home.”</p><p>“I’ll see you both on Monday.”</p><p>Rio opened her door as Agatha gently coaxed Nicky awake—though he remained bleary-eyed, and required both Agatha’s and Rio’s help to stumble, still half-asleep, toward Agatha’s front door.</p><p>She left Rio in the living room as she took Nicky upstairs, barely able to remember the last time she’d seen him so tired. “Goodnight, sweetheart.” Agatha kissed the top of his head after he’d tucked himself up in bed. “I hope you’ve had a good day.”</p><p>“The best day, Mom. Thank you for taking me, even though you hate soccer.”</p><p>“I don’t mind it so much when I’m with you.”</p><p>He offered her a sleepy smile, and Agatha shut his door behind her as she made her way back downstairs.</p><p>Rio had settled herself on the couch, face illuminated by her phone screen.</p><p>Agatha flicked on a lamp. “You could’ve put the light on, you know.”</p><p>“Thought I was supposed to be incognito.” Rio’s eyes sparkled as Agatha joined her on the couch, sitting close, pressing her thigh and her arm against Rio’s. “Didn’t want to give the game away.”</p><p>“I don’t think anything is waking Nicky up tonight.” Agatha leaned in close to press her lips to Rio’s like she’d been longing to all day—she kept it chaste, despite the desire swirling through her gut, not wanting to get too carried away too quickly.</p><p>“You have fun today?” Rio slid one arm along the back of the couch and pulled Agatha into her side. “Have I converted you to women’s soccer?”</p><p>“Mm, not quite.” Agatha wouldn’t be volunteering to attend any games without Rio, that was for sure. “But I did enjoy it. And Nicky had the time of his life, so thank you for that.”</p><p>“I told you—I’m happy to spend time with him. He’s great.”</p><p>“He thinks you’re pretty great, too.” Agatha tugged Rio’s hair out of its bun so she could run her fingers through it. “I think your plan of winning him over is working.”</p><p>“Yeah?” Rio tilted her head, eyes fluttering closed as Agatha gently tugged at her hair. “And is he the only Harkness I’m winning over?”</p><p>“You already won me over, Rio. And I’m pretty sure you knew that.”</p><p>“Still nice to hear from time to time.” Rio grinned. “And speaking of winning people over… Alice wants you to come for drinks with us next time we go out.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but be surprised by the admission. “Really?”</p><p>“Yeah. She really likes you.” Rio narrowed her eyes, assessing Agatha’s response. “Why do you look like you don’t believe me?”</p><p>“I’m just… not used to that.”</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows arched. “People liking you?”</p><p>“I guess.” Agatha glanced down at her hands, away from Rio’s probing gaze. “I don’t have any friends, other than Wanda. None of Ralph’s friends ever liked me—although the feeling <em>was </em>mutual. I’m not used to people wanting me around.”</p><p>“Hey.” A gentle finger pressed to the underside of Agatha’s chin, forcing her head up. “Well, you’d better get used to it. Because <em>I </em>want you around. And so do my friends.”</p><p>Warmth flooded through Agatha as she relaxed into Rio’s side. “Okay. We’ll get drinks.” She rested her head on Rio’s shoulder. “Did you meet both Alice and William through your PhD program?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Rio’s fingers drew patterns on the bare skin of Agatha’s shoulder, and her eyes fluttered closed at the feeling. “Alice and I are the same year—we bonded immediately over our love of women and rock music. And William is a couple years behind us, but we took him under our wing—sometimes I feel like he was my annoying younger brother in another life.”</p><p>It was clear from the tone of Rio’s voice that she loved both of them, and Agatha was so grateful she had that in her life. “Do they know what you do?”</p><p>“Yeah. William gets all squirrelly if anyone mentions it—he’s so awkward, it’s hilarious—so I don’t talk to him much about it. But Alice is a different story. She’s even my safety check-in sometimes.”</p><p>“Safety check-in?”</p><p>“Mm, whenever I met a client, I make sure someone knows where I am, if I’m not at home, and who I’m with. And then after a session’s finished, I check in with them to make sure they know I’m okay.” Clearly, Rio could feel Agatha tensing at the thought of her <em>needing </em>that in the first place, of how that wasn’t all that safe at all, because by the time something <em>had </em>happened to her, it would be too late—because Rio smoothed a hand down her arm. “Hey. It’s okay—nothing bad has ever happened to me when I’ve been with a client. It’s just an insurance policy.”</p><p>Agatha forced herself to take a deep breath out. “And Alice is your insurance policy?”</p><p>“Only if Natasha’s not around.”</p><p>Agatha frowned, sure she’d never heard Rio mention that name before. “Who’s Natasha?”</p><p>“Natasha is my colleague.”</p><p> “The one who met with Ralph.” Of course. Agatha leaned away from Rio’s shoulder so she could meet her gaze. “Are you close?”</p><p>A slow smile spread across Rio’s face. “Don’t tell me you’re jealous of her.”</p><p>Well, considering Agatha’s only experience with a dominatrix was someone who looked like <em>Rio</em>, could you blame her for the flash of insecurity? “Answer the question, Rio.”</p><p>“No, we’re not close.” Rio’s voice was earnest. “I wouldn’t say we’re friends, just coworkers. I met her when I worked at the dungeon, and I liked her—she kept herself to herself, but she was good at the job. I knew starting my own business would be a lot if it was just me, so I asked a couple of the girls if they’d be interested in coming with me. Natasha was the only one who said yes.” Rio’s hand slid to the back of Agatha’s neck, playing with the baby hairs there.</p><p>“And what does she think about you stopping soon?”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “She’ll stop, too. I think she’s only kept on with it this long because she enjoys it. She doesn’t need to do it—her wife is some hotshot federal agent. She definitely doesn’t need the money.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened. “She’s married?”</p><p>“Uh-huh. Does that help with the whole jealousy thing?”</p><p>“And her wife is okay with what she does?”</p><p>“Maria’s pretty chill.” Rio dropped her hand to the back of the couch, eyeing Agatha warily. “Why do you sound so surprised? You know we date people. <em>You’re </em>dating me, knowing what I do.”</p><p>“But I know you’re quitting soon.”</p><p>“I see.” Rio’s expression turned cold, and she shuffled so that her back was pressed against the arm of the couch, putting a few inches of space between them. “And if I wasn’t? What—you wouldn’t have lowered yourself to asking me out?”</p><p>“I—<em>no</em>!” Fuck, Agatha had gone and put her foot in her mouth, hadn’t she? She could see the hurt in Rio’s expression, hated that she’d put it there. “No, that’s not what I meant at all, Rio, please believe me. I don’t see you as less than, I never have. And it would make me a hypocrite if I did—I hired you, for fuck’s sake!”</p><p>“Only because you thought that was the only way you could be with me.”</p><p>“Which was flawed logic.” Agatha reached out her hand, extending it towards Rio and relieved when Rio took it, slotting their fingers together. “Even if you did this for the rest of your life, I would still want to be with you.” She held Rio’s gaze, <em>needed </em>Rio to know she was speaking the truth. “There is nothing on this Earth that would drag me away from you now—you make me happier than I’ve ever been in my life. It’s just… I can’t deny that it’s hard sometimes. I would struggle if this was forever.”</p><p>With a sigh, Rio tugged Agatha closer—she ended up straddling Rio’s hips, her arms around Rio’s neck and Rio’s around her waist, her back slouched so she could press their foreheads together. “I know. It’s hard for me, too. Especially knowing you struggle with it.”</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>“Never apologize for the way you feel,” Rio said, the intensity in her brown eyes making Agatha’s breaths stutter. “I want you to be able to talk to me. Is there anything I can do to reassure you?”</p><p>Agatha’s heart ached at the quiet words, at the imploring look on Rio’s face, at how it felt, for the first time in her life, to be really and truly cared for. “Not anything more than you already do. I know it’s something I need to work through myself.” Agatha ran her fingers once again through Rio’s hair. “Is there anything I can do to reassure <em>you</em>?”</p><p>Rio’s smile was as soft as the kiss she pressed to Agatha’s lips. “You already do, Agatha. The way you took care of me last weekend… no one else has ever done that. Everyone else I’ve been with either wants to ignore my job completely, or thinks I’m a sex-crazed maniac who <em>must </em>want to throw them around the bedroom, and that if I don’t, there’s something wrong with either me or them. Usually me. Because if I do it all day, I <em>must </em>be into that kind of thing in the bedroom too, right?”</p><p>“But you’re not.” Agatha would be blind not to notice Rio’s reactions when it came to intimacy—she was happy to cede control to Agatha, <em>loved </em>following orders.</p><p>“No, I’m not. But no one else has ever noticed that before—or cared enough to, at least.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, Rio.” Agatha kissed her forehead. “You didn’t deserve that.”</p><p>“If it brought me here, to you, then it was all worth it.” Rio’s arms tightened around her waist. “You make me feel worth something. Make me feel seen. Make me feel—” Rio cut herself off, and Agatha ached to know what she had been going to say. “Just promise me, if you ever doubt the way I feel about you, you’ll tell me? I don’t want to lose you over something we could’ve talked through.”</p><p>“I promise.”</p><p>The next time Rio kissed her, it was tinged with desperation—like the thought of ever losing Agatha was inconceivable, unsurvivable. Agatha gasped into Rio’s mouth, kissing her back with the same fervor, losing herself in the stroke of her tongue, the sting of her teeth biting on her bottom lip, the heat of Rio’s body arching up into her own.</p><p>It hadn’t been her intention, when she’d invited Rio inside, to end up here—not with Nicky upstairs, not when Agatha couldn’t take her time—but all she wanted, as Rio’s mouth slid along the column of her neck, was Rio’s hands on her, <em>inside </em>her, to be consumed by her until there was nothing left <em>but </em>Rio and the way she made Agatha feel.</p><p>Powerful, wanted, desperate.</p><p>Loved.</p><p>That last thought made her heart skip a beat, but there was no other word for the reverence with which Rio kissed her skin, murmuring into Agatha’s neck that she was beautiful, that she was perfect, that she felt so good.</p><p>For the way Rio’s hands, inching up her front to cup her breasts, touched her so gently, like she was something to be savored, something to be enjoyed, rather than a means to an end.</p><p>For the look in Rio’s eyes, as she leaned away from Agatha’s neck to pop open the button of Agatha’s jeans and slid inside—for the way her eyelashes fluttered, at the first brush of her fingertips through the slick between Agatha’s thighs, all for her.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t used to feeling loved.</p><p>Sure, Nicky loved her, and Wanda loved her, but this, <em>this </em>was different, this was all-consuming, raw and wonderful, and Agatha knew, as Rio watched her face as she pressed two fingers inside, cataloguing every single micro expression on Agatha’s face, that she’d never felt loved like this before.</p><p>And, too, she had never <em>loved </em>like this before.</p><p>The thought made the breath stutter out of her as her hips rocked against Rio’s palm, her hands in her own hair, drunk on Rio’s wide-eyed gaze as she watched Agatha move.</p><p>It rose to her lips, but Agatha bit it back, because would Rio say it back? Was it too soon? Would it send her skittering away?</p><p>But what if it <em>didn’t</em>? What if Rio was waiting for her to say it first, not wanting to scare <em>her </em>away? Rio had laid herself bare before Agatha countless times, open and vulnerable—could Agatha offer her the same courtesy in return?</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha breathed, after a particularly deep thrust of Rio’s fingers. “Rio, I—”</p><p>A creak on the landing cut Agatha off, both of them freezing, trying not to breathe too loudly in the sudden deathly silence.</p><p>Just when Agatha had convinced herself it was a false alarm, another sound came—this time footsteps, followed by a tiny, uncertain voice calling down the stairs. “Mom?”</p><p>“Nicky!” Agatha’s voice was strangled, panicked as she tried to extricate herself from Rio’s lap, Nicky’s voice like a cold bucket of water to her desire. “Are you okay, sweetheart?”</p><p>“I had a nightmare.”</p><p>As a toddler, he’d often wake screaming, haunted by his subconscious, but it had been years since his last one.</p><p>Glancing at Rio, remembering what Agatha had nearly said, Agatha really, really hoped it wasn’t an omen. She shook her head, knowing she was being ridiculous. And maybe it was a good thing—did she really want her first I love you to Rio to be grinding against her hand on the couch, both of them fully-clothed?</p><p>No, Rio deserved something much more special than that.</p><p>“I’m coming, Nicky—go and get back into bed and I’ll be there in a second, okay?”</p><p>“Okay. Thanks, Mom.” Nicky’s footsteps retreated, and Agatha breathed out a sigh of relief, grateful he hadn’t come down the stairs.</p><p>She glanced toward where Rio still sat against the couch, looking absolutely beautiful with her dark eyes and flushed cheeks. “I’m so sorry.”</p><p>“It’s fine.” Rio rose to her feet only to kiss Agatha’s cheek. “Nicky is your first priority, always. I know that. Go, make sure he’s okay—I’ll wait a few minutes and order an Uber home. I can sneak out without him hearing.”</p><p>Agatha felt awful, walking away from Rio after such a heavy conversation and then without touching her to reassure her Agatha wasn’t going anywhere.</p><p>As always, Rio read her like a book. “It really is okay, Agatha. Call me when he’s gone back to sleep, if that’ll make you feel better?”</p><p>“Okay. I’ll speak to you later.” Agatha allowed herself one last look at Rio, smiling at her softly in the middle of her living room, illuminated by the soft glow of the lamplight, before she opened the door and walked upstairs.</p><p><em>Soon</em>, Agatha promised herself. <em>Soon, Nicky will know, and I won’t have to walk away from her like this ever again. </em></p>

<p>When Agatha knocked lightly on Nicky’s bedroom door, she found him already in bed with the covers pulled up to his chin, his cheeks pale and his eyes red.</p><p>“Oh, sweetheart.” Agatha crossed over to him and smoothed his hair away from his sweaty forehead. “Do you need a cuddle?”</p><p>He lifted up the covers. “Yes, please.”</p><p>Agatha nestled herself in next to him—a much tighter squeeze than the last time they’d done this. She opened her arms and he snuggled into them, his head on her chest, and Agatha told herself to enjoy this while it lasted, knowing it wouldn’t be long before he rejected all comfort from her.</p><p>“Do you want to talk about it?”</p><p>“I don’t want to upset you,” Nicky said, his voice quiet and uncertain.</p><p>“Hey.” Agatha smoothed a hand down his back. “You don’t have to worry about me, okay? It’s my job to worry about you. You can tell me anything, no matter what. Always.” Agatha let him sit with the words for a moment, waiting to see if he’d open up to her.</p><p>“Okay.” Nicky’s sigh was heavy. “Do you remember when I went out to the arcade with my friends from school on Wednesday?”</p><p>“I—yes.” Agatha was thrown by that, having expected something different. Had he managed to sneak onto one of those zombie shooter games that Agatha always insisted he wasn’t old enough for?</p><p>“Well, when we were walking there we went past a restaurant, and I saw Dad inside. With a woman. It looked like they were on a date.”</p><p>“Oh.” Agatha wasn’t surprised—if she was dating, she couldn’t expect Ralph not to. And she couldn’t be mad at him for it, either—it wasn’t like he’d flaunted it in Nicky’s face. They’d both simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time. “Why didn’t you tell me earlier?”</p><p>“I didn’t want you to be sad.”</p><p>“You don’t have to hide things from me, Nicky—I’m a big girl, I can look after myself. And your father and I… you know we’re not together anymore. He hasn’t done anything wrong.” Agatha listened to his steady breaths. “Is that what your bad dream was about? Your father moving on?”</p><p>“Not exactly.” Nicky tucked his head under Agatha’s chin, preventing her from getting a look at his face. “I dreamed that… that they got married and she was this wicked stepmother like the ones from the movies and she tried to take me away from you.”</p><p>“Nicky.” Agatha tightened her arms around his body, still so small against her own. “Nothing in this world is ever going to keep me away from you.”</p><p>“Promise?”</p><p>“I promise.” Agatha kissed his forehead. “Your father and I love you very much—even if we both do move on, that’ll never stop being true.”</p><p>“Okay.” Nicky sniffled, and Agatha squeezed him even tighter.</p><p>“And your father would also never let anyone who acted like an evil stepmother anywhere near you—nor would I. You come first, sweetheart. I hope you know that.”</p><p>“But… that doesn’t mean you won’t find someone, does it?” Nicky shifted back to look at her, peering up at her with wide eyes. “Because I don’t want you to be lonely. Or to turn out like Grandma.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips—while she’d done her best to shield Nicky from Evanora, she’d still weaseled her way into his life. At least, unlike Agatha, Nicky hadn’t ever done anything <em>sinful</em>—she treated her grandson a hell of a lot better than she’d ever treated her daughter. “There is no universe in which I become like my mother, sweetheart. Don’t you worry about that.”</p><p>His eyes still weighed on her face, filled with worry.</p><p>“Does this mean that… if I <em>did </em>want to move on, you’d be okay with that?” Agatha all but whispered the words, her heart beating fast in her chest. She hadn’t, for one moment, expected it to happen like this, but presented with such a golden opportunity to talk to Nicky about it, Agatha couldn’t let it slip away.</p><p>Nicky worried at his bottom lip with his teeth. “It would be weird,” he said, the words halting. “But I think so.” His smile turned cheeky. “So long as you promise they won’t be an evil stepfather.”</p><p>The words, meant to be a joke, were like a suckerpunch to Agatha’s stomach. Because Nicky might be able to accept her moving on, but could he accept her moving on with another woman? And how the fuck was Agatha supposed to even broach that topic?</p><p>It wasn’t the first time she’d wished for a parenting manual, and it probably wouldn’t be the last, either.</p><p>If she could summon one that had a chapter titled <em>how to come out to your kid</em> that would be fan-fucking-tastic.</p><p>“About that, Nicky…” Agatha knew she needed to tell him. She wouldn’t get a better chance than this. She should just… rip off the BandAid. Go all in. Get it done. “I want you to know that I have actually been on a couple of dates with someone. And that someone isn’t a man—they’re a woman.”</p><p>Nicky sat fully up in his bed, frowning down at her as he processed what she’d just said. “A woman?”</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha sat up, too, leaning her back against the headboard and wondering if she should have just kept her mouth shut. Keeping Rio a secret hadn’t been too bad, right? Maybe it wasn’t too late to take it back and pretend she hadn’t said anything. “You know how we talked about all the different kinds of families, and that sometimes women fall in love with other—”</p><p>“I know what being gay is, Mom.” Nicky rolled his eyes. “I just didn’t know <em>you </em>were.”</p><p>Agatha bit back a lecture about how a woman being in a relationship with another woman didn’t necessarily mean they <em>were </em>gay, because sexuality existed on a spectrum and Agatha wasn’t even sure if she was ready to label herself as anything yet—it didn’t seem like the time.</p><p>Nicky’s gaze turned accusatory. “Is that why you and dad broke up?”</p><p>“No. Your father and I broke up for a multitude of different reasons, Nicky.” Had it contributed? Probably. But it wasn’t the catalyst. “Sometimes, relationships just don’t work out, and it’s no one’s fault when they do.”</p><p>Blue eyes stared at her for another few seconds before Nicky nodded, deflating as he sagged back against the wall. “Okay. Well, can you promise <em>she’s </em>not gonna be an evil stepmother, then?”</p><p>Just like that, the tension evaporated between them, and a laugh bubbled from Agatha’s chest. “I can categorically promise you that she’s not, Nicky.”</p><p>“Can I meet her?”</p><p>Well, Agatha had gotten this far. What was one more bombshell before the night was through? “You can, but… you already have.” She watched Nicky’s face—his frown deepening, corner of his mouth scrunching as he absorbed Agatha’s words.</p><p>And then his mouth dropped open. “Coach Vidal?!”</p><p>Agatha absolutely could not tell if he was excited or horrified. “Yes.”</p><p>“I <em>knew </em>it was weird when you asked her to get pizzas with us!”</p><p>Agatha could not believe that was the one thing he’d latched on to.</p><p>“This is so <em>cool</em>. Wait until I tell Billy and Tommy! They’ll be so jealous that Rio’s going to be my new stepmom.”</p><p>“Woah, woah, woah.” If he said anything like that around Rio, Agatha was going to die of mortification. “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves here, Nicky. We have been out a few times—we are <em>not </em>getting married. And you’re not to call Rio anything other than Rio or Coach Vidal without her express permission.” Parent was a role a person should not be thrust into. “But more importantly—you’re okay with this?”</p><p>Nicky regarded her seriously. “As long as it doesn’t mess with my soccer team. Rio said we might win the league if we keep playing the way we have been!”</p><p>Of course that would be his first priority. “It won’t affect your team at all.”</p><p>“Okay.” Nicky crawled back over to her, letting Agatha pull him into a much-needed hug. “I just want you to be happy, mamma.”</p><p>He hadn’t called her that since he was four years old, and her heart ached, happy tears springing to her eyes that she was quick to blink away. “I am happy, sweetheart.”</p><p>“Can she come over tomorrow?”</p><p>“I’ll ask her.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">* * *</p><p align="center"> </p><p>“Hey. Thought you might have fallen asleep.” Rio smiled at Agatha from her phone screen, propped up on the pillow next to her own, her voice a low timber into Agatha’s ears through her AirPods.</p><p>“Sorry, I was with Nicky for a lot longer than I thought.” Agatha stretched out on her sheets, fighting sleep as she felt herself relax beneath the warm weight of Rio’s gaze. She kept her voice quiet, not wanting to wake Nicky after he’d finally fallen back to sleep.</p><p>“Must’ve been a bad dream.” Rio’s hair was messy around her shoulders, face illuminated so, unlike Agatha, she must have bothered to turn on a lamp rather than relying on the glow from her screen.</p><p>“He dreamed that Ralph got a new girlfriend who turned out to be a Disney villainesque evil stepmother.”</p><p>“Oh, shit.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“I guess that means he’s not ready to hear about us, then?” Rio’s voice was soft with understanding, but Agatha knew there was disappointment hidden in there, too.</p><p>“Actually… we had a good talk. About me and Ralph and why it’s okay if we both move on—and that he’ll always come first regardless.” Agatha took a deep breath. “And I did tell him about you and I. I hope that’s okay—I knew we haven’t really discussed it in anything more than an abstract kind of way, but it came up naturally, and I didn’t want to—”</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio cut her off, eyes sparkling. “Stop spiraling. Of course I’m okay with you telling him. I’m glad you did.”</p><p>“You are?”</p><p>“Of course.” God, Rio’s smile eased every single one of Agatha’s worries. “I want to be able to be open with our relationship, and we can’t do that without Nicky’s blessing.” Her smile faded, nerves flashing across her face. “How did he take it?”</p><p>“He thinks it’s the coolest thing ever.” Agatha rolled her eyes, though she couldn’t bite back her smile—especially when she saw Rio’s own face light up, relief palpable in her eyes. “He adores you.”</p><p>“That’s good, because I adore him, too. God, I’m so relieved he’s okay with it.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Yeah. I worried that if he wasn’t, you’d stop seeing me. And I… I don’t know if you’ve noticed, Agatha, but I’m pretty fucking fond of you. I’d hate for anything to get in the way of this. Of us.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart swelled impossibly further beneath the weight of Rio’s words, from the fond look on her face. “Well, you have Nicky’s seal of approval so you don’t need to worry about him anymore. He’s invited you over for dinner tomorrow, if you’re free.” Agatha knew she might not be—she’d spent all of Saturday with them, and she’d need to make up time with those clients another day.</p><p>But Rio didn’t hesitate. “I can be there around seven?”</p><p>“Seven is great. I probably should have asked this before, but you don’t have any dietary requirements, do you?”</p><p>“No.” Interest sparked in Rio’s eyes. “Are you cooking? Because I have <em>missed </em>your cooking.”</p><p>“I’ve barely cooked for you.”</p><p>“Incorrect—you made me the best grilled cheese I’ve ever tasted, and an omelet that I’m sure was really good, but I ate it too fast to fully appreciate the flavor.”</p><p>“Mm, yes, you were a little distracted that morning, weren’t you?” Agatha’s voice lowered, turned teasing, and Rio’s eyes darkened. No doubt, like Agatha, she was remembering being bent over her kitchen table.</p><p>“Yes.” Rio’s voice was hoarse.</p><p>“Are you going to be able to behave yourself around my son tomorrow?”</p><p>Rio pouted. “I always behave myself.”</p><p>“I’m not so sure about that.” Lying in her bed in Rio’s stolen shirt, relaxed against the sheets and thinking about the last time Rio had been there with her, Agatha’s heart thudded. She squeezed her thighs together, the ache that had been pushed to the back of her mind while she’d been with Nicky returning full force with Rio’s eyes on her face. “I wish you were here now,” Agatha said, breathless. “To finish what we started earlier.”</p><p>Rio moaned, the sound obscene right in Agatha’s ear—want flooded through her, curled around her gut, and pooled between her legs. “Fuck, Agatha. I wish I could be with you, too.” Rio’s voice was husky, her teeth white against her bottom lip, and Agatha could see a flush on her cheeks. “You have no idea. The things I’d do to you…”</p><p>Agatha whimpered—would be louder, if she weren’t conscious of trying to keep herself quiet. “Tell me.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze met hers, her pulse hammering in the base of her neck. “Yeah?”</p><p>“Yes. <em>Please</em>.”</p><p>“Fuck, you’re so hot when you beg.” Rio shifted, sitting up in her bed. “Close your eyes, baby. But keep holding your phone up for me, okay? I want to see your face.”</p><p>Another whimper, and Agatha bit down hard on her bottom lip as she obeyed. She’d never done anything like this before, but she didn’t feel vulnerable, giving herself over to Rio like this—she only felt wanted.</p><p>Rio’s breathing was harsh in her ears, already affected. “If was there with you, the first thing I’d do would be to kiss you. Everywhere I could—lips, neck, chest, thighs. I love how soft your skin is, I love how you react under my mouth—the noises you make, the way your hips press into me.”</p><p>Agatha’s hips shifted on the bed, made restless by the mere sound of Rio’s voice. She’d been wet before, when Rio had touched her, but she knew it would be tenfold worse now, the roughness in Rio’s tone driving her wild.</p><p>“I love how sensitive your breasts are. The way your back arches when I brush against your nipples. I bet they’re begging to be touched right now, aren’t they?”</p><p>Not trusting herself to open her mouth without moaning Rio’s name, Agatha nodded her head—the movement enough for Rio to hum in approval.</p><p>“Then touch them for me.”</p><p><em>Fuck</em>.</p><p>Her stomach clenched. Agatha had never been good at following orders—she was much better at giving them—but she rushed to obey, pinching her nipples in the way she liked, imagining that it was Rio’s warm touch instead.</p><p>“That’s it, baby. You’re doing so good.”</p><p>Another jerk of Agatha’s hips—god, was this how Rio felt when Agatha praised her? No wonder she liked it so much.</p><p>“You look so good.” Agatha heard the rustle of sheets in her ears, and then Rio’s soft moan. “<em>Fuck</em>.”</p><p>Agatha opened her eyes to look at her phone, biting harder on her bottom lip at the sight waiting for her—Rio’s dark eyes and messy hair, lips parted as she panted, and a hand clearly working between her thighs. Agatha watched the flex of the muscles in Rio’s upper arm as she fucked herself.</p><p>“I thought I told you to keep your eyes closed.” Rio didn’t look like she was complaining though, holding Agatha’s gaze.</p><p>“You told me to close them.” Agatha barely recognized the timber of her own voice—thoroughly wrecked, and she hadn’t even come yet. “Not to keep them closed.”</p><p>Rio laughed, low and dirty. “I should’ve known you’d be a brat if we tried things this way around.”</p><p>“I want to see you.”</p><p>“Okay. You can see me.” Agatha watched Rio’s lips part in another moan, felt like she was going to vibrate out of her own skin. “But only if I can see you come, too. I want you to touch yourself, Agatha. Two fingers, like I had inside you before.”</p><p>Again, Agatha was quick to obey—her phone shook in her right hand as she slid her left beneath the waistband of her flannel pajama bottoms. She wasn’t surprised to find herself soaked, wetness on her thighs as she ran two fingers through her slick before sinking inside herself.</p><p>“Are you wet for me, baby?” Rio’s voice was enough to bring Agatha close to the edge—she nodded as she rocked her hips up to meet the desperate thrusts of her fingers, able to hear the sound of it even over Rio’s panting. “I’m wet for you, too. You have no idea what you do to me. How much I want you.”</p><p>Agatha had an idea, if it was anything like the feelings coursing through her own body.</p><p>“I’m close,” Rio murmured, head tilted back against her headboard, throat exposed and all but begging for Agatha’s teeth to sink into it.</p><p>“Me too.” She was clenching around her fingers, each rock of her hips dragging her clit against her palm. Her eyes fluttered closed, drunk on the pleasure that was almost within her grasp. “So close.”</p><p>“Look at me,” Rio said, her voice imploring. “I want to see your eyes when you come. I want to see what I do to you.”</p><p>Agatha forced her eyes open, forced herself to look into Rio’s eyes, and on the next curl of her fingers she circled her palm <em>just </em>enough to send herself hurtling over the edge, jaw clenched so she didn’t make any noise.</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>.” Through a haze of post-orgasmic bliss, Agatha watched Rio come, too—her head thrown back, her cheeks pink, and unlike Agatha, <em>loud </em>as hell.</p><p>The sound of her was almost enough to make Agatha come again.</p><p>“That was perfect,” Rio murmured when her eyes blinked open, long after Agatha had wiped her sticky fingers on the sheets. “<em>You </em>are perfect.”</p><p>“And you look beautiful like this.” Tousled and spent, desperately trying to catch her breath. Agatha had never seen a better sight. “Thank you for a wonderful day.”</p><p>Rio’s smile was angelic. “You’re welcome. I’ll see you tomorrow? Or—” Rio glanced at the time with a wry smile. “Later today, I suppose.”</p><p>“Yes. Goodnight, Rio.”</p><p>“Goodnight, beautiful.”</p>

<p>The roar of Rio’s motorcycle engine heralded her arrival long before she knocked. It gave Agatha a chance to wash her hands and discarded the—cute, but definitely not sexy—apron she’d been wearing while she cooked.</p><p>“She’s here!” Nicky screeched, when the knock did come, racing to the door before Agatha had the chance to step out of the kitchen—by the time she made it to the hall, he’d already wrenched the door open. “Hi, Rio!”</p><p>“Hi, Nicky.” Oh, she looked fantastic in a pair of biker jeans, a black sweater and her leather jacket, her hair scraped up into a high pony.</p><p>“You ride a motorcycle?” Nicky peered around Rio at the bike parked behind Agatha’s sedan. “That is so <em>cool</em>! Can you take me out on it?”</p><p>“Sorry, kid.” Rio spoke before Agatha had the chance to ruin all of his hopes and dreams. “You’re way too young.”</p><p>“There’s an age limit?”</p><p>Agatha was pretty sure there wasn’t—though she thought it was ridiculous there wasn’t—but she wasn’t going to volunteer to tell Nicky about Rio’s white lie.</p><p>“Uh-huh. Have to be at least sixteen.” Rio glanced over Nicky’s head, lips curving into a smile when she saw Agatha. “So maybe you can check with your mom in six years’ time.”</p><p>“Oh, I’ll have you trade in that death trap for a real vehicle long before then,” Agatha said, arms folded firmly across her chest. “Nicholas, you are not setting <em>foot </em>on one of those things until you’re out from under my roof.”</p><p>“Fine.” Nicky took Rio’s hand and tugged her over the threshold. “Come in! I want you to meet Senor Scratchy.”</p><p>If Rio was surprised by his easy acceptance of her into his home, she didn’t mention it as she let him drag her toward the kitchen.</p><p>“Nicky, give her a minute to breathe first. At least to take off her jacket and shoes.”</p><p>With a dramatic sigh, Nicky let go of Rio’s hand, allowing her to kick off her boots and hang her jacket up amongst Agatha’s once more. From the bag slung over her shoulder, Rio produced a bouquet of flowers, handing them to Agatha with a flourish.</p><p>“For you, m’lady.”</p><p>“Thank you.” If Nicky wasn’t there, tapping his foot impatiently, Agatha would kiss her. But she didn’t want to push things too fast, so she settled for breathing the scent of the flowers in deep, making a mental note to ask Rio what each flower meant when they were alone. “They’re beautiful.”</p><p>“So are you.”</p><p>“Gross,” Nicky murmured, nose scrunched in distaste as he glanced between them.</p><p>“Oh, I’m sorry, Nicky—you’re beautiful, too. Or would you prefer handsome?”</p><p>He blushed, his discomfort seemingly erased by Rio’s teasing. “Will you come and see Scratchy now?”</p><p>“Of course. I’ve heard so much about this rabbit—I can’t wait to meet him.”</p><p>Rio followed Nicky through the kitchen and down into the basement, which Ralph had kitted out to be a bunny paradise—aside from Agatha’s washing machine, anyway. Agatha trailed a few steps behind them, content that her simmering chicken in peppercorn sauce wasn’t going to burn.</p><p>“Wow. This is pretty awesome, Nicky.” Rio glanced around the rabbit playpen with wide eyes as Nicky bounded over to where Senor Scratchy sat, munching on hay, and scooped him into his arms. “How old is he?”</p><p>“Two.” Nicky proudly presented the rabbit to Rio, who glanced down uncertainly. “He won’t bite.”</p><p>“How do I hold him?”</p><p>“Just like I am.” Nicky lifted Scratchy toward Rio again.</p><p>Rio glanced at Agatha, seemingly for help.</p><p>“Like you’d hold a baby,” Agatha said, but that just made Rio’s eyes widen further.</p><p>“I’ve never held a <em>baby</em>, Agatha.”</p><p>“Ever? You’re twenty-nine years old!”</p><p>“And? That doesn’t mean anything!”</p><p>“Come here.” Agatha descended the final few steps, reaching for Rio’s arms and positioning them so that she’d be able to cradle the rabbit in them. “Like that. He’s not too wriggly. And if you drop him, he’ll bounce.”</p><p>Nicky glared at Agatha as he carefully transferred Senor Scratchy into Rio’s arms. “Don’t drop him.”</p><p>“I’ll try my best.” Rio looked a little lost, as the rabbit situated himself—he stretched up on his back legs, nose twitching as he sniffed at Rio’s face, examining the newcomer. Then he nestled into the crook of Rio’s elbow, content. “He’s so soft,” Rio murmured, lifting one hand to run along his back.</p><p>“Did you not have a rabbit growing up?” Nicky stroked Scratchy’s back along with Rio, peering up at Rio’s face.</p><p>“I didn’t, no.” Rio’s voice was soft. “I was never allowed any pets.”</p><p>“Oh. Well, that’s okay—you can have custody of Senor Scratchy when I’m not here. You can make sure both him and Mom don’t get lonely while I’m at Dad’s.”</p><p>The words—the sweetness of both them and the look in Nicky’s eyes—stole the breath from Agatha’s lungs.</p><p>From the look that crossed Rio’s face when she glanced down at Nicky—eyes wide and shimmering, before they were hastily blinked away, with tears—Agatha had the sense that she felt the exact same way.</p><p>Could it really be that easy? Could Nicky accept Rio just like that? Agatha had hoped, of course she had, that tonight would go well considering how much Nicky already adored her. But she’d still worried. Part of her was convinced that something was going to go wrong, ruin her happiness, because she still felt, deep down, like maybe she didn’t deserve this.</p><p>Didn’t deserve someone like Rio, bright and beautiful and tender, so patient and so soft and so loving with Agatha without her ever having to ask.</p><p>Didn’t deserve to be happy, considering all the awful choices she’d made over the years. Shouldn’t she be made to suffer a little longer? How had she found the right person at the right time, without even looking for her?</p><p>How could Rio be so perfect in everything that she did, and still want Agatha?</p><p>“Thanks, Nicky.” Rio hugged the rabbit closer to her chest, burying her face in his soft fur, and Agatha suspected it was to give herself a precious minute to collect her thoughts—and her emotions. “I promise I’ll take care of both of them.”</p><p>“I know you will,” Nicky said, like it was simple, like his utter faith in Rio was unremarkable. He turned to Agatha. “Is food nearly ready? I’m hungry.”</p><p>With a laugh, unable to comprehend how it was so easy for him to switch topics, Agatha let out a long breath. “I’ll go and finish up. Can I trust you two to put Senor Scratchy to bed?”</p><p>After seeing two earnest nods, Agatha left them to it, jogging back up the stairs to serve the chicken along with roasted vegetables. She opened a bottle of wine for herself, and put a bottle of the beer Rio had drunk last time she’d been over by her place at the table, and a glass of juice for Nicky.</p><p>All the while, she listened to the soft sound of Nicky’s voice talking Rio through Senor Scratchy’s bedtime routine—complete with a carrot as a treat. Agatha knew each step well, considering how Nicky had very firmly told her that she had to do <em>exactly </em>what Nicky did on the evenings he wasn’t around.</p><p>It was a good thing he loved that damn thing so much.</p><p>Footsteps finally sounded on the stairs, and when they both emerged, Agatha directed them to the sink to wash their hands before ushering them into the dining room. “Dinner is served.”</p><p>“This looks amazing.” Rio settled into her seat with her eyes wide. “Thank you, Agatha. I am so relieved you can cook.”</p><p>“You can’t?”</p><p>“Not really. Enough to survive, but nothing like this.” Rio glanced at Agatha like she was waiting for permission before diving in—when Agatha lifted her own fork, Rio started eating with her usual gusto. “It tastes even better than it looks.”</p><p>Agatha’s shoulders relaxed, though she hadn’t been too worried—Rio had already proved she was appreciative of Agatha’s skills in the kitchen. “Glad it meets your seal of approval.” And Nicky’s, judging by the speed with which he was shoveling chicken into his mouth.</p><p>“Can we watch a movie after dinner?” Nicky asked, when he paused to take a breath.</p><p>“If you want to.” Agatha glanced again at Rio, directing the question toward both her and Nicky.</p><p>“Movie sounds cool,” Rio said. “Who gets to pick?”</p><p>“I’ll let you two argue amongst yourselves.” Agatha didn’t really care what they watched—she’d most likely be too busy watching either Rio or Nicky to pay much attention anyway.</p><p>“What kind of movies do you like, Rio?” Nicky turned to Rio with wide eyes, like whatever she might have to say was the most important thing he would ever hear.</p><p>“I like scary ones,” Rio whispered, pretending like Agatha couldn’t hear her. “But I don’t think your mom would want me to pick one of those—it might give you nightmares.”</p><p>Nicky’s eyes widened even further. “What’s your favorite?”</p><p>“Hmm.” Rio tapped her lips. “Halloween is a classic, but I also like Nightmare on Elm Street. And Scream is a modern great.”</p><p>“Can we watch one of those?” Nicky asked Agatha.</p><p>“Absolutely <em>not</em>.” He wouldn’t sleep for a week. “Not until you’re at least fifteen.”</p><p>“That’s ages away!”</p><p>“It’s only five years.” Rio’s fork clattered onto her plate as she finished the last of her food. “It’ll be here before you know it.”</p><p>Agatha shuddered, knowing Rio was right but not ready for her boy to be so close to going to college.</p><p>“Tell you what,” Rio said, leaning close. “On your fifteenth birthday, I’ll show you some of my favorite horror movies, okay? That can be my present to you. And your mom won’t be able to stop us.”</p><p>Nicky’s face lit up at the promise, and even if Agatha knew a lot could change in five years, the words warmed her all the same.</p><p>“What kinds of movies do <em>you </em>like, Nicky?”</p><p>“Superheroes.”</p><p>“Of course.” Rio wrinkled her nose. “I <em>suppose </em>I could sit through one of those if you really wanted to.”</p><p>It was the right answer, based on the way Nicky’s face broke into a big grin. Agatha had no doubt he’d pick something he’d already seen a thousand times, eagerly awaiting Rio’s reactions—but Agatha would be, too. It would be nice to see if they rolled their eyes at the same points.</p><p>“Why don’t you go and set up the movie while Rio and I clear up the plates, sweetheart?” Agatha said once they’d all finished eating. She wanted the chance to check in with Rio—she knew Nicky could be a lot, and Agatha wanted to make sure she wasn’t overwhelmed—and it gave her the perfect excuse.</p><p>Nicky scampered into the living room, and Agatha caught Rio’s eye across the table as they both rose to gather the plates together. “You okay?”</p><p>Rio’s smile was soft, and she brushed her fingers across the back of Agatha’s hand as they both reached for the same glass. “I’m perfect, Agatha. Thank you for inviting me over, and for trusting me with him.”</p><p>“Well.” Agatha felt a stirring of discomfort beneath the warm weight of Rio’s gaze—not because it was unwelcome, but because it made her want to melt entirely. “You already see him three times a week unsupervised.”</p><p>“This is different, though.” In the kitchen, Rio reached for Agatha’s waist once the plates had been discarded by the sink. “This means a lot more. Or at least…” Rio trailed off, worrying at her bottom lip with her teeth. “It does to me.”</p><p>God, Agatha really was <em>so </em>incredibly in love with this woman.</p><p>She couldn’t deny it any more than she could send Rio away—she was a part of Agatha now, nestled into her heart right beside her perfect boy.</p><p>“It does to me, too.” Agatha cradled Rio’s cheeks in her hands, thumbs smoothing over her cheekbones. “I’m glad you’re here.”</p><p>“Me too.” Rio leaned down to brush their lips together—before she had the chance to deepen it, footsteps sounded and they hastily broke apart.</p><p>“Are you guys coming?” Nicky’s face peered round the kitchen doorframe.</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha’s lips still tingled from the ghost of Rio’s kiss—she hoped the day would never come when she wasn’t so affected by her touch. She took Rio’s hand and tugged her toward the living room.</p><p>“I just need to use the bathroom first.” Rio squeezed Agatha’s hand before stepping towards the stairs.</p><p>“How do you know where it is?” Nicky glanced at Rio—one foot on the first stair—with his eyebrows scrunched into a frown. “I didn’t think you’d been here before.”</p><p>“I… haven’t.” Rio’s throat bobbed as she swallowed, but thankfully she was a quick thinker. “I was just going to figure it out. There can’t be that many doors up there, right?”</p><p>“It’s the first door on the left,” Agatha said, knowing that last time Rio had been in her home, it had only been Agatha’s en suite she’d used—they’d been far too busy drowning in one another to explore the rest of Agatha’s home.</p><p>“Thank you!” Rio disappeared, and Agatha settled beside Nicky on the couch—he sat in the middle, living a space for Rio on his other side.</p><p>Agatha smoothed a hand through his hair, making him squirm. “How are you feeling, sweetheart?”</p><p>“Fine.” He peered up at her with a quirked eyebrow. “Why wouldn’t I be?”</p><p>“I don’t know. It’s the first time you’ve seen me with someone who isn’t your dad.”</p><p>Nicky shrugged. “It’s okay. I like Rio a lot.”</p><p>As Rio’s footsteps sounded on the stairs, Agatha sighed. “Yeah, Nicky. I like her a lot, too.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">* * *</p><p align="center"> </p><p>Agatha ushered a half-asleep and yawning Nicky up the stairs as soon as the movie had finished—thirty minutes past his usual Sunday bedtime.</p><p>He must have been tired, because he didn’t argue; he gave Rio a shy hug goodbye before allowing Agatha to steer him to his bedroom, checking one last time that he was really fine with Rio’s presence in both their lives.</p><p>Once she was satisfied—both that he was okay, and that he was on the cusp of being blissfully unconscious—she slipped back down the stairs and to where Rio waited for her in the living room, the two of them truly alone for the first time all evening.</p><p>“I’m sorry you had to suffer through that godawful movie.” Agatha threw herself back down on the couch, smiling as Rio began to inch closer to her.</p><p>“It wasn’t so bad.”</p><p>“Come on.” Agatha raised an eyebrow as Rio settled into her lap, a knee on either side of Agatha’s hips. “You’re telling me you enjoyed it?”</p><p>“Oh, no, it was terrible and I would never ever watch it again.” Rio’s hands combed through Agatha’s hair, making her sigh and her eyelashes flutter. “But I could tell Nicky loved it, and that was sweet. And <em>you</em>, with your eyerolling and your muttered commentary about how many unnecessary fight scenes and CGI they can squeeze into one movie was a particular highlight.”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Rio’s fingers tugged, just a little, pulling Agatha’s head back—when she opened her eyes, Rio’s were fixed on her face, dark and hungry. “Not being able to touch you, though? That was torture.”</p><p>“I know.” Agatha had been both grateful for Nicky wedging himself between them, and maddened by not even be able to do something as innocent as take Rio’s hand in her own. Her actions now were far from innocent, though, as she gripped Rio’s hips, thumbs digging into the sharp line of her pelvis. “Especially after how we left things last night.”</p><p>“Mm, but we still got each other off.”</p><p>“Yes, but…” Agatha leaned up, pressing their chests flush together, so she could breathe into Rio’s ear. “Your fingers feel <em>so </em>much better inside me than my own.”</p><p>“Fuck.” Rio’s hips rocked against her stomach, her eyes darkening as she stared at Agatha’s mouth. “I wish we were alone in this house right now. I wouldn’t stop fucking you until you begged me to.”</p><p>Agatha dug her fingers hard into Rio’s hips, forcing Rio to drag her cunt along Agatha’s stomach harder than before. “Oh, sweetheart.” She was panting into Rio’s ear, skin on fucking <em>fire</em>, and she didn’t care how painfully obvious it was that she was so turned on that barely a single touch from Rio’s fingers would send her flying. “I don’t beg. You, on the other hand…” Another tug of Rio’s hips, and Rio had to press the back of her own hand to her mouth to muffle the sinful noise Agatha dragged from her lips. “I don’t think it’d take much.”</p><p>“You wouldn’t even have to ask.” Rio’s voice was breathless, and when she kissed Agatha, hot and filthy, Agatha could taste how much Rio wanted her in the rough slide of her tongue. “I’ll beg you right now.” Rio shifted so that she could press her mouth to Agatha’s ear, breath warm enough to make Agatha shudder, voice as husky as it was needy. “<em>Please </em>touch me, Agatha. You looked so beautiful last night when you were fucking yourself and thinking about me.”</p><p><em>God</em>. Desire shivered down Agatha’s spine, pooling hot and thick between her thighs, pulsing with every new word that left Rio’s beautiful lips.</p><p>“I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it—I close my eyes and you’re all I can see. You made me <em>so </em>fucking wet. I’m so wet now, can you not feel it? Feel how much I need you?”</p><p>Agatha took the invitation, yanking the zipper of Rio’s jeans down so she could cup her through her underwear—the lace was sodden, and Rio rocked against the palm of Agatha’s hand.</p><p>“You drive me so fucking crazy and I love every second of it. I didn’t know it was possible to want someone this much, but I—”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t take it anymore—she shoved Rio’s underwear to one side so she could slide two fingers along the length of her.</p><p>“—<em>oh</em>.”</p><p>“Shh.” Agatha brought her other hand to the back of Rio’s head, guiding her face into the crook of Agatha’s neck. “You need to be quiet, baby. Can you do that for me?”</p><p>Rio nodded against her skin, mouth open to pant hot breaths against Agatha’s collarbones.</p><p>Agatha hummed in the back of her throat, before burying two fingers inside Rio—her hips jerked, but she didn’t make a sound. “Good girl.”</p><p><em>That </em>got a reaction, though—Rio’s walls clenching around her fingers and her teeth sinking into Agatha’s neck, and it was Agatha who had to clench her teeth to smother her own moan. The bite was vicious, likely to leave a bruise, but Agatha fucking loved the pain of it, loved knowing that it was her who had made Rio that desperate.</p><p>It was a mirror of how they’d ended up last night, with Agatha rocking onto Rio’s hand, on the cusp of admitting something she wasn’t sure she was ready for, but as she watched Rio’s hips move, fucking herself on Agatha’s fingers as her teeth dug into Agatha’s skin to quiet the needy whimpers that caught at the back of her throat—</p><p>Agatha realized she didn’t want to hold it back anymore.</p><p>“You feel so good, baby.” Agatha panted the words into Rio’s ear, enjoying how the sound of her voice made the grind of her hips more desperate. “I love the way you feel around me. I love the way you sound.” Agatha pushed in with a third finger, and Rio swore against her neck. “I love how well you take me.” She angled the palm of her hand, giving Rio something to press against her clit, grateful that Rio’s eyes weren’t on her. “But most of all, Rio, I—I love <em>you</em>.”</p><p>Agatha had no idea if it was the words themselves or if it was a coincidence, but Rio trembled all around her, pulsing around her fingers as she came, teeth biting harder at Agatha’s skin. She was going to have to wear a turtleneck tomorrow—of <em>that </em>she was sure—but fuck, it was worth it, the pain sending a bolt of pleasure straight to her own core.</p><p>She fucked Rio through it, heart beating wild in her chest, trying not to panic, trying not to snatch the words back, trying not to thinking about what look might be in Rio’s eyes when she finally raised her head.</p><p>But Agatha need not have worried, because when Rio finally, <em>finally</em> released her teeth from Agatha’s skin and raised her head, her eyes were dark and wet and achingly soft as she cupped Agatha’s cheeks with both hands and pressed her smile to Agatha’s lips. “I love you, too, Agatha.”</p><p>Relief flooded through her, chasing away any and all of her doubts, her heart so full it could burst.</p><p>The kiss was soft and languid, sweet despite the fact that Agatha was still pressed deep inside her—which Rio seemed to realize at the same time Agatha did, based on the subtle rock of her hips. Agatha brought her to the brink a second time, working up her up gently, their lips parting only when they both needed to draw breath.</p><p>After, Rio dropped to her knees between Agatha’s thighs, yanking her to the edge of the couch with a feral look in her eye as she lifted the skirt of Agatha’s dress to her hips and dipped her mouth between Agatha’s thighs like it was a form of worship.</p><p>Agatha came fast and hard with a hand pressed against her mouth to keep herself quiet, and the look on Rio’s face when she glanced up at Agatha, watching her come down from the high with adoration in her eyes, was almost enough to tilt her over the edge all over again.</p>

<p>“Are you sure I look okay?” Rio smoothed a hand down her blouse for what must have been the tenth time since Agatha had picked her up earlier that evening.</p><p>“You look beautiful, Rio.” Agatha pulled into an empty space in the parking lot of her and Wanda’s favorite Italian restaurant and reached across the center console to squeeze Rio’s hand. “It’s just dinner with Wanda and Vision. You don’t need to be nervous about this.”</p><p>Though it was unbearably sweet that she was.</p><p>“What if I make a terrible impression?”</p><p>“They already know you, Rio. Billy and Tommy are on the team as well as Nicky, you know?” In fact, both Vision and Wanda had <em>technically </em>known Rio for longer than Agatha, given that Agatha had managed to avoid anything to do with Nicky’s soccer for his first few weeks on the team.</p><p>“That’s different.” Rio’s leg tapped its usual nervous rhythm, jostling their joined hands with every bounce. “I don’t spend much one-on-one time with any of the parents. And I’m not their coach tonight, I’m their friend’s new girlfriend.” Rio swallowed, her eyes wide. “What if they hate me?”</p><p>“They won’t hate you.” Agatha brought Rio’s hand to her lips, risking her painstakingly applied lipstick to brush a kiss against the back of it.</p><p>“How do you know that?”</p><p>“Because I don’t think anyone could hate you if they got to know you.”</p><p>Rio swallowed, the panic in her eyes yet to ease. “But they <em>could</em>. And I know they’re important to you. What if they don’t approve? I know Wanda knows what I do.”</p><p>“Yes, she does, and she’s fine with it. She’s happy for me—for us. I promise, Rio. You don’t need to worry. They just want to meet you. Officially.” Plus, Wanda had been warned to be on her best behavior. Agatha trusted she would heed that warning. “Besides, I’ve met <em>your </em>friends. We’re even going out with them tomorrow night—it’s only fair you return the favor.”</p><p>“My friends are all PhD students who barely have their lives together, and tomorrow we’re just going for drinks in a dive bar—this is very different.”</p><p>“It’s not.” Agatha kissed the back of Rio’s hand one more time before reaching for the door handle. “It will be fine. Come on.”</p><p>As soon as they were out of the car, Agatha took Rio’s hand again, lacing their fingers together as they walked through the restaurant door. Wanda and Vision were already settled in a table by the window, Wanda lifting a hand to wave as she noticed them.</p><p>“I’m so glad you’re here!” Wanda rose to her feet to draw first Agatha, and then an alarmed-looking Rio, into a hug. “It’s nice to meet you properly, Rio.”</p><p>“Um, thank you. It’s nice to meet you, too.” Rio accepted Vision’s outstretched hand with a bit more grace, her smile only looking a tiny bit forced as she settled into a seat between him and Agatha.</p><p>“I’ve been wanting the four of us to get together for a while now, but Agatha’s been hiding you from us.” Wanda propped her chin on her hand, green eyes darting between Agatha and Rio.</p><p>“I have done nothing of the sort.” Agatha didn’t bother opening the menu, already knowing she would be ordering the fettucine alfredo. “It’s just difficult to find a time we’re all free when there’s three kids to think about.”</p><p>“True.” Wanda’s face brightened. “It’s nice not to have to worry about them for a night though, right? Thank God for in-laws.”</p><p>“And ex-husbands.” Agatha adored the hell out of her little boy, but the prospect of a full weekend with Rio—clients aside—was going to be heaven.</p><p>Not to mention long overdue.</p><p>She had to admit a part of her had been tempted to reschedule dinner with her friends when she’d gotten a look at Rio’s fitted black dress pants and gauzy blouse—it had been too long since she’d had the chance to properly get her mouth on Rio’s skin without the fear of being overheard.</p><p>“So, Rio.” Wanda’s gaze settled on Rio’s face the moment Rio had discarded her own menu. “Agatha says you’re a PhD student in plant biology? That sounds interesting. Particularly seeing as I struggle to keep them alive for more than a few days.”</p><p>Rio’s lips quirked into a more genuine smile. “Agatha said something similar to me once.” Rio glanced at her, and her smile softened further, into the one Agatha was used to seeing. “I haven’t been to your office in a while—is the one I gave you still alive?”</p><p>“Yes.” Because Agatha had set up a reminder on her phone to water it daily—but she wasn’t going to tell Rio that. “But don’t get any ideas about giving me more—I think one might be the limit of my capabilities.”</p><p>“Plants are more resilient than you think.” Agatha settled her hand on Rio’s thigh when it began to jiggle beneath the table, smoothing her thumb against the muscle. “That’s what drew me to them in the beginning. They can thrive in any kind of environment, places where even the hardiest of humans would never be able to survive. They can communicate with each other, react to sounds—there’s so much they can do that people don’t ever think about.”</p><p>Vision looked thrilled by the prospect. Considering he was an accountant, he probably did find it fascinating. “What specifically is your research on?”</p><p>“I’m looking at how plants change their gene expression in response to light and temperature signals. Our thinking is that if we can isolate what happens in any kind of extreme changes in environment, we can apply that to genetically engineered plants that will then be able to grow regardless of extreme weather conditions.”</p><p>“Like global warming?”</p><p>“Exactly.” Rio’s leg stopped bouncing, some of her nerves easing now that she was in her comfort zone—Agatha knew Rio hated talking about herself, but her research was different. Agatha felt the same—she could talk about her job for hours, but anything even remotely personal? No, thank you.</p><p>As Vision asked her more questions, Agatha watched Rio talk—the light in her eyes, the way she used her hands to illustrate her points, lips stretched into a wide smile. Then she turned her head to reach for her glass of wine, and caught Wanda staring at <em>her</em>. “What?”</p><p>“Nothing.” Wanda lifted her own glass to her lips. “Just never thought I’d see you this whipped.”</p><p>“I am not <em>whipped</em>,” Agatha hissed. “I am in <em>love</em>. That’s different.”</p><p>“Um, what the fuck?” Wanda’s eyes widened. “Since when? Does she know that?”</p><p>“No, Wanda, I’ve just casually announced it to her at the table.” Agatha rolled her eyes, wondering if Rio was even listening—she glanced toward her to check. Based on the way the corner of Rio’s mouth lifted as she listened to whatever Vision was saying, she had definitely overheard the conversation on the other side of the table. “Of course she knows.”</p><p>“And for the record,” Rio said, pausing her in-depth discussion with Vision to glance at Wanda. “I love her, too.”</p><p>“You guys are <em>adorable</em>.” Wanda clapped her hands together. “I’m so happy for you. We should do a toast!” Wanda raised her glass.</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, even as she reached for her own. “To what? Being adorable?”</p><p>“To being <em>happy</em>.” Wanda clinked her glass against Agatha’s deliberately hard. “And to being able to double date now that you’re with someone who isn’t kind of a selfish asshole.” Wanda’s glass clinked against Vision’s and then Rio’s beer bottles. “Ooh, Rio, what are you doing for Thanksgiving? Because you’re more than welcome to join us for the holidays. Agatha makes a mean sweet potato pie.”</p><p>“I—” Rio glanced at Agatha with a helpless look on her face, and Agatha knew it was because they hadn’t discussed the impending holiday season yet—they’d had much more important things to <em>not </em>talk about whenever they were alone together, lately. Agatha had never been so horny in her <em>life</em> as she had been in the past few weeks. “I usually just spend it on my own, or with a friend, if they’ll have me.”</p><p>Wanda’s lips pursed. “That won’t do at <em>all</em>.” She turned to Agatha like it was all her fault. “How come you haven’t invited her?”</p><p>“It hasn’t come up!” Agatha turned to face Rio, taking in the amused quirk of her lips. “But you should spend it with us. If you want to.” Particularly for Thanksgiving, because the thing Agatha was most thankful for this year?</p><p>That Rio Vidal had waltzed into her life and been too stubborn to let her go without a fight.</p><p>Rio’s smile was soft. “I’d like that.”</p><p>“Then it’s settled!” Wanda clapped her hands together, clearly delighted. “You’ll both come to ours, where you belong. As part of the family.”</p><p>A part of Agatha expected Rio to tense up at that, knowing she didn’t have much in the way of her own family—but instead, in the face of Wanda’s easy acceptance, she felt the last of any lingering tension leach from Rio’s shoulders as she relaxed fully for the first time, sagging back in her chair.</p><p>Beneath the table, her hand covered Agatha’s, fingers slotting into the gaps between Agatha’s own. “Looking forward to it already.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">* * *</p><p align="center"> </p><p>The bar was rowdy as Rio led Agatha toward a booth in the back, but Agatha bit her tongue. How could she complain about a little loud music after she’d seen how nervous Rio had been to meet Wanda and Vision last night?</p><p>Letting Rio drag her along to spend some time with her friends like she usually did on a Saturday night seemed rather tame in comparison.</p><p>Not that things had gone badly with Agatha’s friends. Vision and Rio had spent most of dinner bonding over soccer, with Vision even promising to check out a NWSL game next season, and Wanda was smitten with Rio just from the way Rio looked at Agatha, like she was something precious to be treasured.</p><p>All in all, it had been a successful evening.</p><p>Also successful?</p><p>The way Rio had fucked Agatha into the mattress when they’d gotten home, making good on her promise not to stop until Agatha had begged.</p><p>Which she had, eventually, somewhere around orgasm number ten, needing a moment just to <em>breathe</em>. She was still pleasantly sore as she settled into the end seat of the booth, letting Rio slide in next to William.</p><p>Eddie sat on his other side, and they both waved as Agatha and Rio made themselves comfortable.</p><p>“Where’s Alice?” Rio asked as she tugged off her jacket. If William or Billy noticed the dark purple bruise at the base of her neck Agatha had left there last night, they were both polite—or wise—enough not to mention it.</p><p>“Running late, as per usual,” William said. “Did you know she was bringing someone tonight?”</p><p>“Oh, yeah.” Rio glanced at Agatha. “Sorry, I forgot to tell you that this is kinda a triple date situation. She’s been seeing someone for a couple of weeks now.”</p><p>“Apparently it’s not serious,” William added, “but it’s serious enough for us to be introduced. So everyone needs to be on their best behavior.” William’s gaze paused on Rio.</p><p>“What are you looking at me for?” She looked affronted. “I am <em>always </em>on my best behavior. I’m a good girl.”</p><p>Agatha schooled her features into a carefully neutral expression, knowing Rio had phrased it that way just to see if she could get a rise out of her.</p><p>“You can be overprotective.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Eddie shot Rio a nervous glance. “You interrogated me for like two hours the night we first met. It was intense.”</p><p>Rio huffed. “I was just making sure you were good enough for William.”</p><p>“Well, you’re not going to do that tonight, okay Rio? This is the first woman Alice has brought around in…” William’s forehead scrunched as he thought. “I don’t know, actually. A long time. Don’t ruin this for her.”</p><p>Rio muttered something under her breath that Agatha was sure was probably supposed to be uncomplimentary.</p><p>“Oh, hey look—there they are.”</p><p>Both Agatha and Rio turned at William’s words. Agatha saw Alice first, bright smile on her face as she walked toward them—and then Agatha realized whose hand Alice had clasped in her own and her mouth drop opened in horror. “You’ve got to be fucking kidding me.”</p><p>“<em>You’ve </em>got to be fucking kidding <em>me</em>.” None other than Jennifer Kale stood at the table, glaring at Agatha with her lip curled in distaste.</p><p>“Oh.” Alice glanced between Agatha and Jen, rocking back on her heels, her voice small. “You two know each other?”</p><p>Agatha pushed herself to her feet, unwilling to let Jen look down at her. Never mind the fact that Jennifer still had a good few inches on her when they were both standing at their full height—it was the principle of the matter, goddamn it. “You have the <em>audacity </em>to accuse me of having a midlife crisis for dating Rio when you’re doing the exact same fucking thing?!”</p><p>“Oh.” William’s voice sounded from behind Agatha. “They <em>definitely </em>know each other.”</p><p>Jen folded her arms across her chest. “You’re older than me.”</p><p>“By three fucking years!” Fury coiled through Agatha’s stomach, hot and vicious. “I can’t <em>believe </em>you. You’re such a fucking hypocrite, Jennifer.”</p><p>“Okay, maybe I was a little judgy when I saw you with Rio, but can you blame me, Agatha? Last I knew you were married! To a man! And then you’re running around with a <em>woman</em> who is <em>clearly </em>younger than you and I’m expected not to comment on it?”</p><p>“Yes! Because that’s the polite fucking thing to do!” Agatha was all but snarling, knew she was overreacting, going too far, but Jen had always had the rather unique ability to get under Agatha’s skin.</p><p>They’d been in competition for years—over research grants, teaching positions, who could get the best grades out of their classes—and Agatha had done her damned best to keep Jen, and everyone else in her department, at arm’s length. She had a job to earn a living—not for friends. She had Wanda for that.</p><p>She did <em>not </em>want to be grabbing drinks with Jennifer fucking Kale whenever Rio wanted to meet up with her friends.</p><p>“Rio?” Alice threw her a helpless glance. “A little help here?”</p><p>Rio pursed her lips, glancing at Jen, her own arms folded tight across her chest. “I’m not sure what you want from me, Alice. Your girlfriend was kind of an asshole to me the first time we met. She <em>did </em>accuse me of being Agatha’s midlife crisis, and me of being a student much too young for her.”</p><p>Jen’s eyes closed, a flutter of embarrassment crossing her features. Good. “I said I was sorry.”</p><p>“You’re only sorry because it’s blowing up in your face.” Agatha scoffed. “You haven’t apologized to <em>me </em>once since that night.”</p><p>“How can I, when you avoid me like the fucking plague? I’ve tried to, Agatha! I felt awful afterwards, but you turn the other way whenever you see me in the hall despite the fact that our offices are literally opposite one another!”</p><p>“Can you blame me?” Agatha leaned closer, fire running through her veins. “You basically accused me of being a predator!”</p><p>“Okay, we’re not getting anywhere here.” Alice clapped her hands together, desperate to diffuse the tension. “Can we not put it behind us, and try to enjoy the rest of the evening?” Her voice turned pleading as she glanced between Rio, Agatha and Jen. “Please?”</p><p>“I need to cool off first.” Agatha knew she wouldn’t be anything other than snipy if she stayed—she needed some space and some air before she was ready to be reasonable.</p><p>None of them moved to stop her, and she stalked over to the bathroom as she heard bickering voices erupt behind her.</p><p>Once she was inside, she curled her hand around the edge of one of the sinks and glanced at her reflection in the mirror, her eyes wide and feral, brimming with unspent energy. She forced herself to take a deep breath, to dispel the disquiet that Jen’s arrival had flooded her with, knowing she needed to clear her mind before she could even think about setting foot back out there.</p><p>The door opened behind her, and Agatha was unsurprised to see Rio walking through it, her brows pulled into a frown. She crossed over to Agatha and wrapped her arms around her waist, resting her chin on Agatha’s shoulder and meeting Agatha’s gaze in the mirror. “I’m sorry. I didn’t know <em>she </em>was who Alice was bringing.”</p><p>“I know.” Rio’s own reaction had been evidence enough of that. “I’m sorry for reacting like that.”</p><p>“You don’t need to apologize.” Rio squeezed her tighter, and Agatha relaxed back into her arms. “You guys clearly have history.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “It’s not even that deep. We just… I don’t know. We seem to be able to rile each other up. We always have—we’ve worked together for years, but we’ve never gotten along. I know part of that is my fault. I’ve never exactly been an open book at work.”</p><p>“You?” Rio raised her eyebrows, teasing. “Guarded? Never.”</p><p>Agatha flipped her off in the mirror. “I don’t see why I need to share any details of my personal life with the people I work with.”</p><p>“Hmm, maybe because sometimes it’s nice to?” Rio’s lips skimmed against the side of Agatha’s neck, and if she was trying to calm Agatha down, that was certainly one way to do it. “You know, considering they’ll understand exactly what you do and exactly what problems you might face at work.”</p><p>“Are you really taking Jen’s side over mine?”</p><p>“No.” As if in admonishment, Rio nipped Agatha’s skin—over the bruise on her neck that had yet to fully fade, from the night where Agatha had told Rio she loved her. She’d been forced to wear high-necked sweaters and blouses for days. “I’m merely pointing out that it’s not a bad thing for your colleagues to know a little bit about you.”</p><p>“She still accused you of being my midlife crisis.”</p><p>“True.” Rio parted her lips, tongue sliding against Agatha’s pulse point. “She does seem pretty apologetic about that, though.”</p><p>“On her side again.” This time, Agatha said it just to get Rio to bite—which she did, hard enough to make Agatha gasp, her knees buckling. She gripped the sink hard, and Rio chuckled darkly against her skin.</p><p>“I love how responsive you are here.” Rio soothed the sting of her teeth with her tongue, which just made Agatha melt into her further. “And I’m not on her side. I just…” Rio sighed. “I love Alice. And I know she wouldn’t be with someone who was a complete raging bitch. She’s been talking about Jen for weeks and she gets this stupid dopey smile on her face whenever she does—pretty sure it’s the same one I get when I talk about you—so I know it’s serious. And it would be nice if we could all just… get along.”</p><p>“Humph.” Agatha could do that. She could be civil, if it was something Rio needed. But that didn’t mean that she had to cave <em>quite </em>so easily… “I’ll think about it. If you can make it worth my while to behave myself.”</p><p>“Oh yeah?” Rio’s hot breath washed against her neck. “And how would you like me to do that?”</p><p>Agatha turned in Rio’s arms and shoved her—rather unceremoniously, but who really cared—into the nearest bathroom stall, yanking the door shut behind them. Rio gazed at her with parted lips, eyes wide and dazed.</p><p>“First of all,” Agatha said, reaching for one of Rio’s hands and pushing it beneath the waistband of her slacks. Rio took the initiative from there, brushing her fingers through dark curls before sliding between her thighs—gasping when she discovered that Agatha hadn’t deigned to put on any underwear. “You can fuck the edge off right here and now.”</p><p>She was already slick—both from the earlier deep kisses Rio had teased her with before insisting that they had to leave or they were going to be late, and from Rio mouthing at her neck—sighed as Rio circled her clit, gathering wetness before pressing first one, then two fingers inside her.</p><p>“And then?” Rio prompted, leaning Agatha back against the stall door so that she could pump her fingers harder, curling them over that spot that made Agatha’s eyes roll back.</p><p>“And then, after I’ve gone out there and played nice for a while,” Agatha panted, nails digging into Rio’s back as she added a third finger, fucking Agatha hard enough for the door to shake—if anyone stepped inside the bathroom there would be no hiding what they were doing, and that just turned Agatha on even more. “You’re going to take me back to your place, and you’re going to reward me.”</p><p>Rio moaned into her ear, and she shifted to circle Agatha’s clit with her thumb with every thrust of her fingers. “And how would you like me to reward you?”</p><p>“Hmm.” Agatha tilted her head back, baring her neck for Rio to press open-mouthed kisses to. “I want t-to tie you up. And then I want to sit on your face, and have you fuck me with your tongue until I can’t hold myself up anymore. Until you’re begging me to let you come. And <em>then </em>I want to fuck you with your strap until you can’t take it anymore.”</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>, baby.” Another hard thrust of Rio’s fingers had Agatha seeing stars, her moans muffled against the sweat-slick skin of Rio’s neck. Rio fucked her through it until Agatha reached for her wrist, slipping her fingers out—only to suck them between her lips instead. “Fuck,” Rio said again, her eyes wide and her pupils blown. “Can we not just go home right now?”</p><p>Agatha hollowed her cheeks before she pulled Rio’s fingers free with a pop. “No. You told me I had to play nice.”</p><p>“That was before.”</p><p>Agatha grinned, wicked, before she righted her disheveled clothes and stepped out of the bathroom stall. She glanced at herself in the mirror while Rio, still dazed, washed her hands, knowing there was little she could do to hide her aura of freshly-fucked, and finding that she didn’t really care if everyone knew what she’d just been up to.</p><p>“Come on.” Agatha took Rio’s hand and pulled her back toward the table.</p><p>Alice and Jen were talking in low voices to William and Eddie, Alice’s arm slung along the back of the booth to curl around Jen’s shoulders.</p><p>Agatha let Rio sit down first, wanting to be on the end in case she felt the sudden need to bolt.</p><p>Alice took one look at Rio’s face before she snickered. “<em>Cooling </em>off, huh?”</p><p>Reaching for the glass of red wine on the table that someone had presumably ordered for her, Agatha smirked as Rio blushed. “Yes, and it worked <em>remarkably </em>well.” Agatha glanced at Jen. “I’ve promised to be on my best behavior.”</p><p>“And so has Jen,” Alice said, shooting Jen a warning look when she opened her mouth. “We’re going to have a nice drink together, aren’t we?”</p><p>Jen <em>really </em>looked like she wanted to comment on what Agatha and Rio had been up to in the bathroom, but with considerable effort, managed to bite her tongue. “Yes.” She sipped from her own glass of wine, eyeing Agatha like one might a wild animal. “How did you and Rio even meet, anyway?”</p><p>“Rio coaches my son’s soccer team.” It wasn’t a full-blooded lie. And Agatha would rather die than admit the truth of their first meeting to Jennifer fucking Kale of all people. “How did you and Alice meet?”</p><p>“Dating app,” Jen said.</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “<em>You’re </em>on a dating app?”</p><p>Beneath the table, Rio placed a warning hand high on Agatha’s thigh—clearly, that tone of voice was not appropriate.</p><p>“Yes, Agatha. We’re not all still living in the year 2000. Phones do more than just call people these days, you know?”</p><p>Agatha wondered, based on the way Jen winced, if Alice had a similar grip on <em>her </em>thigh.</p><p>“You are literally <em>three </em>years younger than me,” Agatha muttered into her wine glass. “You act like I’m an ancient old crone.”</p><p>When Jen’s eyes lit up, Alice cleared her throat. “Okay! Let’s talk about something else. It’s nearly Thanksgiving—what’s everyone doing for the holidays? I know Rio’s abandoning me.” The look she sent Rio was more teasing than wounded, though.</p><p>Agatha turned to Rio. “You were supposed to be spending it with Alice?”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “We usually spend them together. Orphans banding together for the holidays, you know.”</p><p>“But it’s fine.” Alice smiled at Agatha from across the table. “I can keep myself entertained.”</p><p>Agatha glanced between Jen and Alice. “You two don’t want to spend them together?”</p><p>“Oh, I’m not inflicting my family on Alice this early in our relationship.” Jen shuddered. “That would definitely scare her away.”</p><p>“Then you can come and join us.” Agatha knew Wanda wouldn’t mind—the more the merrier, as far as she was concerned. The woman would take in the whole neighborhood if she found out they had nowhere else to go.</p><p>Alice looked touched. “Really?”</p><p>“Of course. You shouldn’t spend them alone.” Agatha glanced at Rio. “And I know Rio would appreciate having a familiar face there.” While their dinner with Wanda and Vision had gone well, Agatha knew it would take Rio some time to feel truly comfortable around her friends. And Thanksgiving would be a crazy affair, with the three kids, plus Wanda’s brother and his family, and Vision’s in-laws. Agatha sometimes got overwhelmed, and she had been going to Wanda’s for years.</p><p>“Okay, then.” Alice’s smile was warm, and Agatha forgave her there and then for inflicting Jen on her for the evening.</p><p>And based on the look on Jen’s face—quiet and contemplative—Agatha might have won her over, too.</p><p>Both Agatha and Jen managed to behave themselves for the rest of the evening—to Rio’s and Alice’s obvious delight. Agatha only had to bite her tongue a handful of times; maybe Jen wasn’t so bad after all. Not that she’d ever admit that aloud to another person.</p><p>And later that night, when Rio all but dragged Agatha into her bedroom the second they got home, Rio definitely made it worth her while.</p>

<p>“Left hand red.”</p><p>Rio glanced at the only free red spot on the Twister mat—which just so happened to be near-impossible to reach. She’d have to twist herself over both Nicky and Tommy to get there, and considering she was already bent at an extremely awkward angle, she’d have to be a contortionist to make it.</p><p>She glared at Alice, sitting at the couch with the spinner in her hands, smug grin on her face. “You are <em>so </em>cheating to make this difficult for me.”</p><p>“Am not,” Alice said. “See?” Alice turned the spinner, finger pressed to the middle to keep the arrow in place.</p><p>“I didn’t see you spin it.”</p><p>“You can’t cheat, Rio!” Billy’s cheerful little voice piped up from beside Alice—he’d been knocked out of their game early on. “You have to do what Alice says.”</p><p>“Yeah, Rio.” Alice’s eyes glinted with mirth.</p><p>Rio sighed. She wouldn’t make it there—but that didn’t mean she couldn’t have fun trying. So she stretched out her left arm toward the empty red dot, and when she inevitably tumbled to the ground, she took both Nicky and Tommy with her, tickling both their sides until they shrieked.</p><p>The noise drew the attention of both of their mothers, who had been busying themselves in the kitchen, Agatha and Wanda peering at the three of them over the back of the couch.</p><p>“What is all this racket for?” Wanda settled her hands on her hips, raising an eyebrow as she took in the sight of Rio splayed on her back on the crumpled mat with a boy on either side of her.</p><p>“Rio cheated at Twister!” Nicky said, his eyes bright and his cheeks flushed.</p><p>“Me?” Rio pressed a hand to her chest as she sat up. “I didn’t cheat! I fell!”</p><p>“Onto us!” Tommy’s voice was indignant. “We shouldn’t have fallen—we need a rematch!”</p><p>Rio groaned, rubbing at the back of her neck. “<em>You </em>boys can have a rematch. I’m too old for this. How did I even get saddled with playing this game with you, anyway?”</p><p>“Because you’re a disaster in the kitchen,” Agatha said, her gaze fond as her eyes met Rio’s. “And you’re the only one flexible enough to keep up with these three.”</p><p>“I could have gone the rest of my life without hearing how flexible you think Rio is, thank you very much,” Alice muttered—too quietly for the boys to take much notice. Rio swatted at her knee, while Agatha’s lips twisted into a smirk.</p><p>Rio wanted to feel that smirk pressed against her skin.</p><p>What she’d give to play a game of naked Twister with Agatha… Rio sighed wistfully as she climbed to her feet. As nice as it was to be surrounded by the warmth and energy of both their loved ones, Rio would very much like the chance to be alone with her girlfriend for an hour or six.</p><p>Especially considering how Agatha had woken her up that morning—with her mouth between Rio’s thighs.</p><p>Merry fucking Christmas to her.</p><p>“You boys play,” Rio said, as she stretched her arms above her head. It made her tacky Christmas sweater ride up, baring her stomach, and Rio grinned when Agatha’s hungry gaze zeroed in on the flash of naked skin.</p><p>Three months since first getting together, and they still couldn’t keep their hands off one another.</p><p>Rio fucking loved it.</p><p>Rio fucking loved Agatha Harkness, utterly and completely and whole-heartedly.</p><p>If she didn’t, there was no way she’d have found herself embracing this much chaos on Christmas Day. Hers were usually spent curled up on the couch with Alice watching shitty Christmas movies in her barely decorated living room.</p><p>Not in the Maximoff house—sorry, <em>grotto</em>, with the amount of decorations inside it, lights hanging from every available surface and a tree in every room—entertaining three of her soccer charges while the real adults cooked dinner.</p><p>And Rio knew it would only grow even more chaotic soon, when the rest of Wanda’s family arrived. Thanksgiving had been crazy, and <em>busy</em>, but Rio had kind of loved it, too. She wasn’t used to seeing that many people—certainly wasn’t used to being treated as part of the family—but Agatha had pressed close to her side the whole day, making sure she was okay.</p><p>Just like she was doing now, tilting her head toward Wanda’s hallway in silent instruction.</p><p>Rio followed Agatha out there, smiling when strong arms immediately wrapped around Rio’s waist, drawing her in close. “You okay?” Agatha asked, her eyes on Rio’s face.</p><p>Rio loved those eyes—so deep a blue she sometimes felt like she was drowning. “Yes.” She leaned in to press her lips to Agatha’s, sighing against her mouth and wondering if Agatha would ever cease to make her heart race. “Are you?”</p><p>“Mm.” Agatha rested her head against Rio’s forehead, breathing her in. “Maybe next year we’ll just have Christmas as you, me and Nicky.”</p><p>“You love this, really.”</p><p>“I do. It’s just… it’s a lot compared to what I’m used to.”</p><p>“Me too.” Rio kissed her again, just because she could. She knew that Agatha’s childhood had been almost as tumultuous as Rio’s own, and wasn’t surprised that Agatha hadn’t spoken to her mother since the day of her and Rio’s first and only session, when she’d turned up with a split lip. If Rio ever got her hands on Evanora Harkness…</p><p>“I love you,” Agatha murmured, breath warm against Rio’s lips.</p><p>“I love you, too.” So fucking much. So much more than Rio had ever thought it was possible to love another person—her heart didn’t feel big enough to hold the weight of the adoration she felt for both Agatha and Nicky.</p><p>She’d never thought she would have a family. It just hadn’t seemed like it could ever happen, for someone like her, when she’d never had one of her own.</p><p>But Rio knew that with Agatha, she’d found one. They might only have been three months in, but Rio already knew this was forever.</p><p>And from the easy way Agatha spoke about a future for them together—be it planning a vacation for the new year, or casually talking about their plans for next Christmas—Rio knew she felt the same way.</p><p>Next week, they were going to start decorating Rio’s hallway together. She was still seeing a handful of her clients, but she’d cut back over the last few weeks, starting to wind her business down—both in preparation for the absolute insanity of trying to finish her thesis, and because Rio wanted to spend every free second with Agatha and Nicky, rather than working.</p><p>Agatha had never asked her to stop, but Rio knew her job was difficult for her to cope with, sometimes. And Rio had honestly started to resent it taking her time away from being with her two favorite people.</p><p>Which had never happened once before in the past eight years.</p><p>It was how Rio knew she was ready.</p><p>And how she knew Agatha was her one and only.</p><p>“I have a special present for you later,” Agatha murmured, her voice low in Rio’s ear, and her eyes, when she leaned back, dark and hungry, leaving Rio with little doubt about what the nature of that present may be.</p><p>Thank God Nicky was spending the night—and the next two days—with Ralph.</p><p>“Oh yeah? Do I get any hints?”</p><p>“No.” Agatha pressed an open-mouthed kiss to Rio’s neck, with <em>just </em>enough pressure to make her pulse race. “I’d like to keep your guessing. But make sure you eat plenty at dinner—you’ll need the energy.”</p><p>With one final wink, Agatha turned and sauntered into the kitchen, making sure to sway her hips as she went, drawing Rio’s gaze to the incredible curve of her ass.</p><p>Agatha Harkness and her insatiable appetite was definitely going to be the death of Rio.</p><p>But what a fucking way to go.</p>
