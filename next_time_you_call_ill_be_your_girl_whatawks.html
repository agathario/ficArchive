<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha banged on her bedroom wall <i>yet again</i> at 3 am. She felt bad for whoever was on the other side, but hearing their screaming, crying baby every night for the last week through the world’s thinnest apartment wall was some type of medieval torture method brought back from the dead just to punish her.</p><p>After a few minutes, she heard her neighbor grow quiet, and Agatha finally settled in bed, weighted blanket atop her duvet, eye mask settled firmly over her head, before the screaming started up again. “Oh for the love of-”</p><p>She shoved her covers away and ripped the mask off before standing, taking a second to grab her purple floral robe and loosely draping it over some threadbare shorts and her black tank top. She stormed out of her home in nothing but fluffy slippers, knocked harshly on the door next to hers, and waited. She huffed out, exactly once, half out of annoyance and half to blow her messy hair out of her face without sacrificing her slouch.</p><p>A woman opened the door, with warm brown eyes, legs for days, leading up to boxer shorts that suddenly made Agatha’s mouth go dry, and an apologetic look as she held the culprit against her hip. “Hi. Can I-”</p><p>“Yeah, hi, Agatha. Also, that baby is big enough to sleep through the night,” Agatha interrupted.</p><p>“I’m Rio,” tried the other woman, extending the hand that wasn’t holding a wriggly child, who couldn’t have been a year old yet. After a beat of Agatha not shaking it, she dropped it. “And this is Nicholas.” As if on cue, Nicholas began to whimper when he heard his name. “He’s having some sleep regression issues,” Rio continued, trying to sound cheerful as she stared at Nicholas.</p><p>“Well,” Agatha said, moving closer to Rio, “<i>I’m</i> now having sleep regressions too. I can hear you guys every single day of the week.”</p><p>“Do you have any kids, Agatha?”</p><p>“No, but I know that Nicholas should be a good sleeper by now.”</p><p>As she looked closer, Agatha could see the cracked edges of Rio. Her ponytail was haphazard, her socks mismatched, and the old basketball t-shirt she wore definitely had spit up on the sleeve.  “He’s…It’s complicated.”</p><p>Before Agatha could reply, Nicholas began to wail, yet again. Rio winced at his ear-splitting screams and just walked back into the apartment. Agatha took that as a sign to follow her in.</p><p>As she shut the door behind her, she took in her neighbor’s apartment. It was a layout that mirrored Agatha’s own, and she wondered if the reason she’d been hearing Nicholas’s cries so clearly was because they had to share a bedroom wall.</p><p>But, beyond the layout, there wasn’t a lot of similarity.</p><p>Agatha had her creature comforts and a lived-in space, yes, but Rio’s…felt less like a home and more like a garden center. Between the plants taking over the space, and low lighting, and the mismatched baby toys and supplies, Agatha felt slightly disoriented.</p><p>“Please,” Rio whined from the living room. Agatha saw her sit with Nicholas in her lap. “I fed you, I changed you, I bathed you, I am one step away from putting sleepy time tea in your bottle. C’mon, Nicky.”</p><p>Ignoring her words, as if he could understand them anyway, the baby kept crying.</p><p>Agatha looked on and, in her delirious, sleep-deprived 3 am brain, did the only logical thing she could think to do. She crossed the room in three large steps and picked her strange neighbor’s baby up. She cradled him against her collarbone, head held just above her heart, and began to rock him back and forth as she paced the room.</p><p>She wasn’t sure what <i>exactly</i> Nicholas would like, but she had a hunch. He seemed shocked to have another human hold him, his dark brown eyes going wide and curious as they stared up at Agatha.</p><p>Then, his cries quickly went from loud to whimpers, to absolutely nothing at all until Nicholas was sleeping peacefully in Agatha’s arms. She hummed nonsensically as she kept pacing, eyes on the tiny hand that was curled into her shirt.</p><p>“How’d you do that?” Rio asked, mesmerized.</p><p>“Sometimes babies just want to be walked,” Agatha replied, still looking down at the child in her arms.</p><p>“But <i>how</i>?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “I just know. Can’t we just leave it at that?”</p><p>They were quiet for a bit, Agatha continuing her motions around the living room while Rio watched on from the couch.</p><p>When Agatha was certain Nicky wasn’t going to wake up, she asked Rio where his crib was.</p><p>“Oh,” Rio replied with a blush. “I haven’t had a ton of time to set things up for him, but it’s back here.”</p><p>“Time to set up? This baby looks like he’s at least seven months old?” Agatha was confused as she followed the other woman down a hallway and into what was obviously Rio’s bedroom.</p><p>“Wow, you’re good. He’ll be eight months in two weeks.” Rio pointed to a blue pack and play that was empty except for a stuffed Snoopy in one corner.</p><p>“That doesn’t answer my question. Also, he needs a crib.”</p><p>Rio grimaced. “I know, I know.”</p><p>“So…?” Agatha tried.</p><p>“I’m taking care of it. There was a mix-up and we got the wrong one delivered but I promise a real crib is coming tomorrow,” Rio replied quickly. “Can’t we just leave it at that?”</p><p>“<i>Rio</i>,” Agatha replied, knowing her own words had been used against her as she tried not to wake the baby while chastising the other woman.</p><p>“Listen,” Rio said, now whispering, before she moved about the room to turn on what looked like an incredibly fancy baby monitor. “I’m still half convinced you’re a figment of my sleep-deprived imagination.“</p><p>“All the more reason to wonder why you’re unprepared to have this baby?”</p><p>“It just…It just happened.”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“Okay, let’s make a deal. You accept I’m Nicky’s legal guardian, and I won’t ask any questions about why you’re so good with kids. Deal?”</p><p>Agatha frowned but nodded. “Deal.”</p><p>+++</p><p>When Agatha ran downstairs the next morning, a million and one bags in tow and more importantly, <i>late for having overslept</i>, she spotted Rio grabbing her mail. Nicholas was strapped to her chest in a ridiculous baby bjorn.</p><p>Agatha had to admit that her glare softened when Rio lifted Nichols’s chubby hand up and made him wave goodbye to her.</p><p>+++</p><p>To make matters worse, Agatha found a still-hot coffee with a sticky note on it when she came home the same day. The note just had <i>They gave me an extra! Thank you again!</i> and a smiley face.</p><p>She rolled her eyes, but uncapped it and stared at the jet black liquid, one eyebrow quirked.</p><p>Agatha dug through her bag, found a pen, and scribbled a note of her own before sticking it on Rio’s door.</p><p>When Rio left to grab her takeout that night, she squinted through hasty writing.</p><p><i>Nice try. Wrong order.</i></p><p>Rio sighed. “No black coffee,” she murmured to herself. “Okay.”</p><p>+++</p><p>A week later, Agatha heard the crying again. Earlier, at least, closer to eleven than three in the morning this time.</p><p>Agatha stood, running through the same motions she had the first time, and walked up to Rio’s apartment.</p><p>Rio seemed surprised but held the door open just the same, inviting her in once more. “You’re back.”</p><p>“I need my sleep,” Agatha replied. She held her hands out to take Nicholas, who calmed slightly, but still sniffled. “Is he-“</p><p>“He needs a bottle,” Rio said, once she was certain he’d handed him off correctly. “I think.”</p><p>“Easy enough.”</p><p>Agatha watched as Rio measured and made a bottle, almost with scientific precision. Once finished, she passed it over to Agatha, who shifted the baby, nestling him in the crook of her arm, before beginning to feed him.</p><p>Rio tilted her head towards the bottle of wine on the counter, eyebrow quirked up, and Agatha nodded once in silent agreement.</p><p>Agatha didn’t want to think about how natural it all felt. She couldn’t. It was just one of those fluke things; she happened to be good with babies, and her neighbor had a baby. Big deal. It was the right thing to do. <i>The price of living in a community or whatever</i>, Agatha thought.</p><p>“He needs to be burped after,” Rio said after sliding Agatha’s wine glass across the kitchen counter.</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“Right, right.” Rio watched as Nicholas greedily drank his milk. “So…what do you do?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes snapped up, and she turned to stare at Rio. “What?”</p><p>“I can’t ask about the whole,” Rio made a vague gesture at Agatha with her hand and a noise that sounded like a growl mixed with a yawn, “that thing, so I figured we’d talk about something else.”</p><p>“And that something else is my job?”</p><p>“You seem very concerned with your beauty sleep for someone who looks this hot at midnight. And I saw you last week with a bunch of papers in hand, so I assumed you’re important somewhere.”</p><p>Agatha blushed and turned back to Nicholas. “Shut up.”</p><p>“You’re right,” Rio shrugged. “Probably the wine talking.”</p><p>“You haven’t taken a sip yet.”</p><p>“Hmm, has good observation skills,” Rio said, pushing off the counter to walk around Agatha, sizing her up. “Are you a P.I.?”</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrowed. “No?”</p><p>“Maybe you do some type of design work? Skilled and meticulous and weirdly sensitive about your art?”</p><p>“Meh, it’s not that creative,” Agatha answered, curious to see what else Rio might come up with.</p><p>“Alright, attention to detail but not that creative…lawyer?”</p><p>“I’m good at arguing if that’s what you’re asking,” she replied with a sly smile. “But I’m mainly focused on defending myself.”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “Business lady? Of some kind?”</p><p>“I do wear suits often, but no.” Agatha tried to hide her smile.</p><p>“I…give up,” Rio acquiesced.</p><p>Agatha sighed, staring at Rio for another beat before giving in to her warm gaze. “History professor.”</p><p>“Ahh,” Rio said, with the click of her tongue. “Good with babies because you like shaping the minds of tomorrow.”</p><p>“Something like that,” Agatha acquiesced. “What about you?”</p><p>“I’m a mortician, currently on leave though,” Rio added, “obviously.”</p><p>“You’re…a mortician?”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow as Nicky gurgled, breaking out of his feeding stupor. “Is that so surprising?” Agatha gave her a look. “Oh. It <i>is</i>.”</p><p>“Well, kind of.” Agatha placed the bottle on the counter and moved Nicky until his head was hovering just over her shoulder. “Burp cloth?”</p><p>Rio grabbed the first one she found, off the kitchen table, and brought it to her. “Why is that surprising?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged, once again situating herself until she could properly burp the baby. “You’re…my neighbor.”</p><p>“I hate to tell you this, but people in Westview <i>do</i> have to live somewhere. Even me.”</p><p>“Right,” Agatha said in a no-nonsense tone. “And isn’t that somewhere usually the funeral home?”</p><p>“I…it’s…it’s a team effort. I’m not the only one involved, so, no, I don’t live at the home. My…coworker does.”</p><p>“Would you ever? At least, while Nicky is still a child?” Agatha questioned after Nicky let out a particularly loud burp.</p><p>Rio snorted at the sound. “Maybe. But I’m not really the kind of person to. I kinda like the separation of <i>that</i> work and…everything else.”</p><p>”Is that why your apartment looks like a jungle? Can’t have your own private, indoor garden at the…there?”</p><p>“Alright, fair,” Rio said with a chuckle. “But when Nicky came around, I suddenly had a lot more time at home and a lot less of an irregular schedule. And he naps a lot, so…idle hands, and all of that.”</p><p>“He takes a lot of naps?”</p><p>“Yeah, like three-ish, sometimes four?”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “No wonder he can’t sleep. Seriously, how did you become a parent?”</p><p>Rio went quiet for a moment. “We agreed not to talk about it, right?”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip, knowing she’d crossed the line. So she stared instead, tracing the lines of Rio’s face with her eyes, nearly saying a prayer for the gap between her teeth, thought about what her pink lips would feel like against her own, and it felt…terrifying.</p><p>Had she followed Rio’s gaze, she would’ve seen the other woman doing the same to her.</p><p>Agatha passed a well-fed and sleepy Nicky over. “Here. Yours,” she said, before practically running out of the apartment.</p><p>Once the door was closed behind her, Agatha took a deep breath. She heard Nicky whimper as Rio shushed him gently, but tonight was not the night to explore…whatever that was.</p><p>She walked away, heart heavy and tears threatening to spill.</p><p>+++</p><p>Two days passed, and, after a particularly satisfying bath, there was a knock at her door. Agatha opened it to see a pumpkin spice latte on her doormat and another note. <i>Sorry. Better?</i></p><p>Agatha felt a pit form in her stomach at the apology. It wasn’t Rio’s fault. She was just…Agatha took a sip. Better, but way too sweet for her.</p><p>She stepped back into her apartment and got ready for work, thinking over and over about how to respond to Rio’s unnecessary olive branch.</p><p>Thirty minutes later, a piece of paper clearly ripped from a notebook was slid under Rio’s door as she tried to get Nicky to eat his applesauce.</p><p><i>Don’t apologize for what you didn’t do. A latte is closer, but this morning was affront to pumpkins worldwide.</i></p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The <i>third</i> time Agatha was summoned to Rio’s apartment by Nicky’s cries, was about a month into her fall semester.</p><p>The days were finally growing shorter as an autumn chill took over most mornings. Agatha, fully in the swing of teaching, appreciated how much she was equal parts feared and adored by her mostly-queer and definitely annoying group of undergrads this semester.</p><p>She was busy most days, working or researching with her grad students, but Nicky had remained in the back of her mind. And Rio, too, Agatha guessed. She hadn’t heard Nicky cry much at night after the week where she’d rushed to Rio’s aid and figured the other woman got his sleeping schedule back on track. She hadn’t gotten another cup of coffee either.</p><p>But, it rare to see neighbors often in her building and Agatha hadn’t even met Rio <i>before</i> Nicholas was seemingly dropped into her lap.</p><p>Still, the few times she heard him through the wall, Agatha had a moment where she thought about what it might feel like to open the door to her apartment and have…people already there. Maybe a baby. Maybe a woman with soft brown eyes and a teasing smile.</p><p>She didn’t realize she’d been standing in front of Rio’s apartment, knocking on the door, until Rio swung it open, Nicky’s cries echoing behind her. “He’s just- You look…<i>nice</i>.”</p><p>Agatha blushed. “I’m-“ her brain short-circuited for a moment. “Thanks.” Her white shirt was crisp, tucked into brown, wide-legged trousers. She’d left behind the matching suit jacket in her apartment, and the navy tie she’d intended on wearing hung loosely over her shoulders, undone.</p><p>Rio sighed as though she wanted to ask something, but instead, motioned for Agatha to come in. “He’s just through here, handsome.”</p><p>Nicky, who’d been fussing on the soft carpet, quieted down when she came in. “Oh, hello, sir.”</p><p>He gurgled in response, and Rio laughed behind her. “Figures. First time he’s seen you in proper daylight, and he already likes you.”</p><p>“He can tell I’m truthworthy.”</p><p>“<i>Or</i> he can tell you’re someone with the ability to change his diaper.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes went wide. “<i>Oh.</i>”</p><p>“I appreciate when you ran over here because he wouldn’t go to sleep at night, but running over during the day might get you into trouble.”</p><p>“I…I can’t do that right now,” she replied, looking down at the shirt and pants that took her forever to iron. “I mean, I could, but I don’t-“</p><p>Rio snorted and picked the baby up. “Like I said, you look nice.”</p><p>Agatha followed them down the hall into a smaller room she hadn’t noticed the few times she’d been here. It looked like it was an office that was somewhat recently renovated into a nursery. She held herself back from making any comments on that point. “I have, um, a faculty mixer.”</p><p>“And all the faculty dress up like that?” Rio asked, one hand on Nicky as she bent down to grab whatever it was that she needed from the shelves of the changing table.</p><p>“Fine. Faculty <i>and</i> stupidly rich alumni who fund us mixer.”</p><p>“Ahh,” Rio replied with a knowing tone.“So you need money.”</p><p>“Don’t we all.”</p><p>“What’s your elevator pitch tonight?”</p><p>“Don’t need one.”</p><p>Rio paused and took two seconds to glance over her shoulder before she continued changing Nicky’s diaper. “You <i>don’t</i> need money tonight, then?”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “Well, no, I <i>do</i> need money for my research, I just don’t need an elevator pitch.”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“Rio,” she responded in the same tone.</p><p>“Agatha, you’re dressed like that, and you’re telling me you aren’t going to at least try and get something out of this?”</p><p>“I’m going to get a very nice dinner and an open bar.”</p><p>“But no funding?”</p><p>Agatha was confused. She’d never had anyone care about what she did or why, especially when it came to her work. “I- I’m- I have funding.”</p><p>“On what research?”</p><p>Rather than wait for her answer, Rio turned and handed the baby to Agatha before running through her motions backwards, storing it all away and moving back out towards the kitchen, dirty diaper in hand.</p><p>Nicky, meanwhile, grabbed onto her unmade tie and waved it around. Agatha smiled softly into his eyes and headed out of the room.</p><p>“My work is focused on the spirituality of women in colonial America,” she said, catching up to Rio, who had just finished washing her hands.</p><p>“Like…Betsy Ross?” Rio asked, drying her hands on a tea towel.</p><p>“Like Goody Proctor.”</p><p>“Were you always interested in that part of history?”</p><p>Agatha switched gears. “What’s with the third degree?”</p><p>“I’m…” the hesitation was clear on her face.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha tried again, a bit more gentle than the last. “What’s going on?”</p><p>“I haven’t spoken to another adult in like three days.” There were unshed tears in her eyes despite the small smile she offered, and Agatha, once again, realized that there was more to all of this than Rio was letting on. “Sorry. Guess I’m just a bit…” she trailed off, waving her hand into the air dismissively, unsure of how to continue.</p><p>Agatha sighed. “I’m into witches.”</p><p>Rio blinked once. Hard. As if her brain was resetting and then, conclusively, echoed, “You’re into witches.”</p><p>“Yes, but weirdly enough, that doesn’t get many bidders at these things. Hence why I don’t need the rich and famous alumni to pay for my research. I just bust my ass writing grants to total strangers.”</p><p>“You could still try,” Rio said with a shrug. Agatha inhaled sharply as the other woman stepped closer, coming toe to toe in order to remove Nicky’s hold on her tie. “Maybe one of them is really into tarot or something.”</p><p>“Or 17th-century punishment,” Agatha grumbled as the backs of Rio’s fingers brushed against her neck, closing the top button there before flipping her collar up.</p><p>“Or that. Punishment.” Rio measured the sides of the fabric, making sure one was longer than the other, before creating a double Windsor knot at the base of Agatha’s neck. “Or maybe they were in The Crucible in high school or something.”</p><p>“You’re such a nerd,” Agatha whispered under her breath, with no real bite.</p><p>“Unfortunately, the whole nerd thing is part of my charm. There,” she adds, taking the opportunity to run a hand down Agatha’s tie, smoothing it down.”</p><p>“Um, thanks.” Agatha’s throat was tight, and she knew it wasn’t due to the tie, but in the way Rio’s hand lingered on her chest before she took a massive step back.</p><p>“Anytime,” Rio replied, gaze locked onto Nicky now instead of her eyes. “You should go,” she added, taking a sharp breath in.</p><p>“Right, right,” Agatha murmured. She handed Nicky back and took a step away, the space between them suddenly feeling like a chasm.</p><p>Rio stared at her. “Good luck tonight.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Agatha replied flatly. “And sorry I came over.”</p><p>That finally managed to clear the air, and Rio cracked a smile once more. “Any time. I mean it.”</p><p>+++</p><p>That same night, Rio heard one sharp knock at her door. She prayed Nicky didn’t wake up as she opened it.</p><p>There sat a steaming mug of hot chocolate in a cup that had UNT written on it with a darkened handle to spell - <i>yup, definitely Agatha </i> Rio realized.</p><p>She didn’t see any note, but it was still a sweet sentiment. And what must’ve been Agatha’s version of a secret confession. After all, who got home from a mixer to make hot chocolate with, yeah, those were mini marshmallows floating around in it near midnight.</p><p>+++</p><p>Agatha sat across from Jen at the campus coffee shop and stared, eyes wide, her buttondown wrinkling deeply as she bent over and stared at the glittering ring on her best friend’s left hand. “To Alice?!”</p><p>“No, to a killer clown. Yes, <i>to Alice</i>,” Jen replied with a roll of her eyes. “She proposed this weekend.”</p><p>Agatha’s brain spluttered. “I- I’m- Congratulations.”</p><p>Jen’s annoyance dissipated quickly as she smiled back. “Thanks.”</p><p>“How’d she, you know, do it?”</p><p>“Well, when a woman loves another woman very much-“</p><p>“Jen.”</p><p>“We went out to dinner at that new rooftop on Third. The apps were good, but the chicken was a bit dry and the drinks-“</p><p>“<i>Jennifer</i>,” Agatha echoed.</p><p>“She got us into this private section right up against the balcony and got down on one knee, and I think I blacked out for a few seconds, but then she,” Jen’s eyes went misty, “she just told me the truth. That she loved me and wanted to be with me forever and that she wanted to be mine and asked if I wanted to be her wife. And thank god that in my near-catatonic state, I said yes.”</p><p>Agatha hid her smile in a well-timed sip of her coffee. “I’m happy for you both.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Jen replied. “Now, you-“</p><p>“Don’t start.”</p><p>“You need a date for the wedding.”</p><p>“It’s months and months away.”</p><p>“It’s at the end of the school year,” Jen deadpanned.</p><p>“Shotgun wedding?”</p><p>“<i>Not</i> the end of <i>this</i> semester, one, and two, you know that’s not how it works despite Alice trying her best.”</p><p>“Gross,” Agatha said, making a face.</p><p>Jen sighed. “I’m serious. Late-May wedding and you have a plus one.”</p><p>“That’s literally so far away.”</p><p>“I just want…I want you to find the same love I have. Especially after-“</p><p>“If you so much as say her name, I will cut your balls off.”</p><p>“I feel like it’s my duty to get you an anatomy textbook after this conversation,” Jen countered.</p><p>“I get the gist of it,” Agatha said, waving her hand around dismissively. “And I’d like to remind you, I’m <i>fine</i>.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Jen frowned.</p><p>And suddenly, she heard her name again, from a familiar voice behind her. “Agatha.”</p><p>She turned and there was Rio, cutting against the line that had formed by the counter to reach her, setting a hand against the back of Agatha’s chair like it belonged there, in a pair of shorts that seemed too summery for fall, a dark green hoodie, and Nicky strapped across her chest in the same baby bjorn Agatha had seen after first meeting them, legs kicking as he babbled happily.</p><p>If Agatha felt a bit woozy, it was because of the seasons changing. Allergies. No other reason.</p><p>“Hi,” Agatha said, stunned at seeing Rio.</p><p>“Fancy seeing you here.” She winked, as though they were both in on the same joke, before turning to Jen. “Hi, I’m Rio.”</p><p>Jen’s expression filled with recognition. “The neighbor?”</p><p>Agatha, meanwhile, snaked a hand up, allowing Nicky to grab one of her fingers in his chubby fist. “And this is Nicky,” she established, with a sideways glance at her friend.</p><p>“Ah,” Jen replied, as if something was clicking into place. “Nice to meet you guys.”</p><p>“What are you doing over here?” Agatha asked. “Making it your mission to visit every coffee shop in town?”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “Nicky had some check-ups at this university‘s hospital this morning.”</p><p>“Is he okay?” Agatha followed up quickly.</p><p>“He’s fine,” Rio said, eyes softening. “He’s a growing boy. Should be walking and talking soon, I think.”</p><p>“Mhm,” Agatha agreed. “Well, we already know he likes the sound of his own voice. I’ve heard it enough.”</p><p>“Maybe he just liked it when you put him to bed,” Rio countered.</p><p>“You should come to poker night,” Jen added, leaning forward as though to cage Agatha in.</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrowed as her head snapped to look at Jen glaringly. “She’s busy.”</p><p>“Nicky is invited too,” Jen added.</p><p>Rio’s eyes flit back between the two women. “Um, I don’t-”</p><p>“It's at Agatha’s this week. On Thursday.” Jen stood, and Rio took a step back, which meant that Agatha had to pull her hand away from the baby. “It’s super chill. Just a bunch of us complaining and drinking wine. We don’t actually play poker usually. Plus, Agatha doesn’t really like cooking for us, so we always get takeout.”</p><p>“That is not-” Agatha began, but Rio interrupted.</p><p>“I can cook.”</p><p>“You don’t have to,” Agatha added as Jen turned to face her with what Agatha could only describe as the vacant smile and wide eyes of a serial killer.</p><p>“She <i>can cook, Agatha</i>, and she lives next door.”</p><p>“Can you play poker?” Agatha asked, hoping the answer would be no.</p><p>Rio shrugged. “Maybe.”</p><p>“Perfect,” Jen replied in the voice Agatha <i>knew</i> she reserved for rhetorical questions aimed at her students. “You’ll text her the time and everything?” she asked, looking down at Agatha.</p><p><i>No dumb questions, my ass</i>, Agatha thought. “I, um, I’d need her number.”</p><p>To Agatha’s surprise, Jen grabbed her bag and coffee. “I’ll let you guys talk about all of that, then! I have a class coming up. See you later.”</p><p>“Nice meeting you,” Rio added, taking Nicky’s hand in hers and making him wave goodbye, much like she’d done to Agatha the day after she’d stopped his crying. To her credit, Jen actually did wave at the baby, smiling sweetly, before giving Agatha crazy eyes once more and scurrying out of the shop.</p><p>“She’s…” Agatha trailed off, looking for the right words to convey her best friend.</p><p>“Not subtle?”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “Unfortunately not. You don’t have to come, by the way, if you don’t want to.”</p><p>Rio smiled and moved closer into Agatha’s orbit. “I know.”</p><p>“My friends are really nosy.”</p><p>“I assumed.”</p><p>Agatha’s brows shot up. “You <i>assumed</i>?”</p><p>“I- I- I mean, if they’re anything like Jen-” Rio stuttered out. “She just seemed-”</p><p>“You assumed correctly,” Agatha murmured. “But I’m not kidding, they’ll have questions about him.”</p><p>“Okay.” Rio took in a sharp breath before adding. “I can tell you but-”</p><p>Agatha cut her off again. “You don’t have to tell me.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Rio replied, shoulders easing down a bit.</p><p>“So…does that mean you’re coming?”</p><p>“I’ll think about it.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “You <i>could</i> come. But like I said, they’ll have questions.”</p><p>“I’ll…I’ll think about it. I mean it.” Before she could add anything else, the woman at the front counter shouted out her name. “I’ve gotta-“ she hooked a thumb over her shoulder to point.</p><p>“Yeah, yeah,” Agatha acquiesced. “Wait. Give me your phone.”</p><p>Rio passed it over. “I would’ve gotten you a coffee if I’d known you’d be here.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “You didn’t see me?”</p><p>“I did and saw you’re drinking tea.” Rio took her phone back, blush appearing on her cheeks, “but you haven’t said <i>no</i> to coffee, so I’ll keep guessing.”</p><p>“Fine,” Agatha sighed. “A cortado.”</p><p>Rio huffed out a laugh. “Like a latte-“</p><p>“But no foam,” Agatha finished for her. “I had one before the tea.”</p><p>“Good to know.”</p><p>+++</p><p>Just outside the student union the next day, Agatha spotted Jen. “Do you feel better about yourself?” she asked, with no lead-up. Not that Jen needed any. She’d know.</p><p>“I do,” Jen replied with a shit eating grin.</p><p>+++</p><p>While it was true that Agatha didn’t like <i>most</i> people in her spaces, she didn’t <i>mind</i> the Thursday night poker crowd. It was a few faculty members she found interesting, or at least, fine enough to talk to, Jen, who was yes, a coworker, but also someone she’d known since high school, and Jen’s fiance Alice, who now that Agatha thought about it, would probably get along with Rio really, <i>really</i> well.</p><p>Those two were the first to arrive. Jen handed over two bottles of wine and then some type of experimental moisturizer she’d created in her classroom chemistry lab after hours. Alice, meanwhile, spoke about how she’d gotten another squirmy man in her chair and how she should be allowed to tattoo people she liked.</p><p>“Swing by if you want a discount,” Alice added, knowing Agatha was a sucker for a good deal, no matter what it was.</p><p>At some point, Lilia simply let herself in, followed by Rio. “She said we could just come inside,” Rio added with a blush as she handed Agatha a tray of something.</p><p>Nicky was in a stroller, barely awake. “Does he need anything?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Just a dark room at some point. Honestly, he was kinda fussy this afternoon, so his nap wasn’t the best.”</p><p>“Okay, well, if you brought a baby monitor, he can go in my room,” she replied, motioning down the hall. “I’m just gonna place this in the kitchen.”</p><p>Rio nodded and walked away as Agatha turned, three sets of eyes staring straight at her from her living room.</p><p>“You know,” Lilia began, “that woman is <i>not</i> your wife.”</p><p>Agatha scowled. “I know that.”</p><p>“Then why are you treating her like one?”</p><p>“We barely said three words to each other.”</p><p>“Yes, but you were instantly…comfortable.”</p><p>“I’m not above bullying elders,” Agatha retorted.</p><p>“Dude, you looked at her like she was the mother of your child,” Alice said, before biting down on a celery stick from the meager veggie spread Agatha had actually managed to lay out for once in her hosting life. “Also, I didn’t realize you were neighbors with Rio.”</p><p>“She’s the mother of <i>a</i> child, not <i>my</i> child.” Agatha looked over at Jen for help, only to see her shrug and nod at Alice. “And, anyways, how do <i>you</i> know Rio?”</p><p>“She’s got a sick piece on her ribs. Like a whole chest branching out into these flowers. Usually, that hurts like hell, but she was a good one. Sat still the whole time, didn’t mess up her wrap when we took breaks, I was impressed.”</p><p>“Babe,” Jen replied. “What a small world.”</p><p>“She’s going to be good for you,” Lilia added. “And you for her.”</p><p>“Don’t start,” Agatha grumbled.</p><p>“I have a sixth sense for- Rio,” Lilia interrupted herself. “How’s the bambino?”</p><p>“He’s good,” the other woman replied. “Went down easy,” she added, turning to Agatha. “I had to unplug a phone charger to connect the monitor but-”</p><p>“That’s fine,” Agatha said, waving her off. “Does this need reheating?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Ten minutes in the oven and it should be good.” She looked over Agatha’s shoulder. “Alice! Hi.”</p><p>Alice grinned and gave a small wave. But, before she could talk, Agatha grabbed her hand and pulled her along, adding under her breath. “Help me.”</p><p>Rio huffed out a laugh. “Who wants wine?”</p><p>“Or kombucha?” Agatha added a bit louder.</p><p>Everyone in the living room raised their hand from what Rio could see over the shoulder not currently being pulled out of its socket.</p><p>“Are these homemade?” Agatha asked, finally taking a peek under the foil after she placed the tray down and began preheating the over.</p><p>“Mhm,” Rio confirmed. “Half chicken empanadas, half cheese. I wasn’t sure if anyone was vegetarian or not. Also, I didn’t know if this was like a full meal situation or more of a snack so…”</p><p>“It’s perfect,” Agatha replied. “It’s kinda both and neither. Plus, if you get Lilia really drunk, she’ll take over the kitchen and make the messiest, most delicious handmade pasta you’ve ever had in your life. It’s why I always keep eggs and spirulina flour stocked. Kombucha for Alice, by the way. She’s sober.”</p><p>Rio hummed in acknowledgement as she uncorked a bottle and moved towards the fridge. “Based on the five seconds I’ve known Lilia, I’d like to see that happen.”</p><p>They worked in silence after that, Agatha ensuring they would have enough food while Rio poured out five glasses. In a split second, Agatha turned just as Rio grabbed a glass, and their eyes met. Rio’s breath hitched as Agatha’s eyes dipped to look at her lips. “Hi,” Rio said dumbly.</p><p>“Hi,” Agatha echoed.</p><p>“How was your day?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flit back up to Rio’s. “It was fine. Kids being themselves, then being annoying, but I think I scared them enough that they’ll finally stop using AI on their papers and think for once.” She took the glass from Rio’s still outstretched hand. “This seems familiar, by the way.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “You seem happier anytime I’m handing you a glass of wine.”</p><p>Agatha grumbled something she couldn’t make out.</p><p>“But, that’s…good,” Rio continued. “About the kids, and stuff. I feel like if you were my teacher, I’d pay way more attention than I did at school. Definitely wouldn’t use AI.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “Were you a slacker?”</p><p>“Kinda,” Rio raised another glass, and Agatha clinked her own against it before they each took a sip. “I was much better at hands-on learning, but I didn’t realize it until mortuary school. Before that, I was always a bit of a class clown.”</p><p>“Oh, so you were popular?”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes playfully. “More heavily using humor as a deflecting tool.”</p><p>“Well, look at who went to therapy,” Agatha replied.</p><p>“Most women like that.”</p><p>“I like it,” Agatha heard herself respond quickly. She blushed and turned to look at the timer. There were still 5 minutes to go. “We should start moving things around. Don’t want anyone to think we’re gone missing.”</p><p>As if on cue, Alice’s head popped into the kitchen. “Need help with anything?”</p><p>“You can take these,” Rio said, passing over two glasses. “The one to your left is yours.”</p><p>Agatha, who’d been focused on the small charcuterie plate she’d made (she tried <i>sometimes</i>), felt Rio step behind her before another covered dish appeared on the counter along with the mug she’d given her ages ago. “Did you hide that in his stroller?”</p><p>Rio nodded, half leaning into the counter, half leaning into Agatha’s personal space. “He was sharing cargo space with some dip and your very nice mug.”</p><p>“He’s a baby,” Agatha said, “not cargo.”</p><p>“I <i>know</i> that, but he was fine.”</p><p>“He better have been,” she murmured out, no real bite in her words, causing Rio to smile.</p><p>Just before they left the kitchen, Rio looked over her shoulder once more, right at Agatha. “Did you buy a pack and play for him?”</p><p>Agatha’s face went beyond blushing, straight to bright red. “No, of course not.”</p><p>“Then why was there one in your room? I mean, granted, I’ve never been in there before, so maybe you have other-“</p><p>“It’s…You said you’d tell me about how you got him?”</p><p>Rio was taken aback. “Yeah, if you really needed to know.”</p><p>“I mean, I’d really <i>like</i> to.”</p><p>“It’s personal.” And Agatha had never been the best with people, but she could tell something had changed with how short Rio’s breaths became and how she avoided all eye contact with her.</p><p>“Most things are,” Agatha said, giving in. “Sorry, I shouldn’t have pushed. I know we agreed, and I know it’s hard for you, and usually I’m not trying to be-.”</p><p>“It’s just hard to…relive,” Rio offered. “I’ll tell you. Tonight. I’ll stay behind to do dishes and-“</p><p>“You don’t have to do that.”</p><p>“No, I want to, and-“</p><p>“Hey, lovebirds,” Jen yelled out from the living room. “Are we gonna play or what?”</p><p>Neither said anything about how red each turned, thank god.</p><p>The next few hours were…nice, actually. Agatha found herself sinking into her own couch. At one point, Lilia did pull out cards from her purse, and Agatha thought there was a chance she might <i>finally</i> get to hustle someone.</p><p>But it became clear that’s not what was happening when Lilia began shuffling the cards. “I’ll do a reading for the room and then whoever needs one.”</p><p>“Needs an exorcism,” Agatha mumbled under her breath.</p><p>“I heard that,” Lilia replied. “Rio,” she added with a flourish to her shuffling, “as the newcomer, I think you should pick the card that determines the group’s energy tonight.”</p><p>There was a bemused look on Rio’s face as she nodded and waited patiently for Lilia to finish her shuffle. Once the cards were presented, she pulled one out. “Two cups.”</p><p>“The two of cups, upright.” Lilia’s smile brightened. “That’s an excellent card for tonight. It represents harmonious partnerships and the beginning of new attractions. Full of strong, soul-mate-level connections. I think you’ll fit right in.”</p><p>Agatha watched as Rio nodded, taking in Lilia’s words. ”Thank you.”</p><p>“Why don’t you pull another?”</p><p>The other three onlookers in the room watched as Rio took a second, contemplating, before tugging on another card, further away from the center than the first she’d pulled. “Oh, um…”</p><p>Lilia’s eyes went wide. “The death card. Endings, transformations, new beginnings. You’ve gone through something recently, haven’t you?”</p><p>Rio bit her lip, nodding quickly. Agatha felt her own jaw tighten as Jen and Alice both looked at each other, then took a sip of the wine they had.</p><p>“It’s changed you,” Lilia said, not as a guess but as a confirmation. “You must lean into the natural cycle.”</p><p>“It’s not that simple,” Rio replied, voice rough.</p><p>“It will be harder to resist it,” Lilia said gently. “But you must also give yourself grace. Time to transform properly. Don’t rush.”</p><p>Rio nodded again and looked at the ground.</p><p>After a few seconds, Agatha chimed in. “I’ll go.”</p><p>Without missing a beat, Lilia whipped her head around and said, “You called me kooky last time, or was it wispy? So, what is it, am I wispy or am I kooky?”</p><p>“You’ll be kicked out if you don’t read my damn cards.”</p><p>The tension in the room seemed to dissipate slightly as Lilia reshuffled. Agatha pulled one out, placing it on her coffee table, and Lilia’s brows went up. “Interesting.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Do you remember your first reading after-?”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, okay, whatever,” Agatha glanced at Rio, who seemed intrigued but not overtly shocked at the interruption. “Not really. Though there’s not a lot I’d want to remember from that time.”</p><p>“The last card you pulled in that reading was this card. Upright. And now you’ve pulled it again, but reversed. The three of swords.”</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“Soooo,” Lilia continued. “If it were upright, you’d still be in the throes of heartbreak, of pain. But you’ve reversed it. As much as you’d like to pretend nothing has happened, you’ve <i>healed</i>, Agatha. Or you’re at least on the right path towards it.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Fine, whatever, sure.” After a beat, she waved her hands, "Someone else, please, go.”</p><p>“I’ll do it,” Alice replied, pulling a card from Lilia’s stack. “Some dude throwing a javelin. Upright.”</p><p>Lilia chuckled, as did Jen. “The knight of wands,” Lilia provided. “You’re courageous and passionate. A little impulsive, but in a good way.”</p><p>Alice grinned. “I’ll take it.”</p><p>“Be careful that impulsiveness doesn’t lead to your demise.”</p><p>“Always such a joy, Lilia,” Jen added.</p><p>But Alice shrugged. “I get it. Good to not think sometimes.”</p><p>Lilia rolled her eyes. “That is <i>not</i> what I said.”</p><p>“But it’s what you meant,” Alice added, causing Rio to chuckle.</p><p>Agatha looked over as Lilia spoke. “Jen? Want to complete the set?”</p><p>“I know if I say no, you’re going to pull a card for me anyway,” she replied.</p><p>Agatha stifled a laugh as Jen glared and Lilia took a card from the stack with a flourish. “High Priestess.”</p><p>“Go on,” Jen said, failing to hide her interest.</p><p>“You’ve got strong gut feelings, Jennifer,” Lilia responded. “You should trust your intuition.”</p><p>“Damn right,” Alice added. “It’s what got you to go out with me after all.”</p><p>“I had a feeling.” Jen’s eyes softened as she looked at her fiancé. “Just like I had a feeling we needed to invite Rio tonight.”</p><p>Rio perked up, eyes flitting away from where they’d been staring at the bridge of Agatha’s nose to Jen. “Right. Thanks.”</p><p>Before anyone could say anything else, the baby monitor crackled to life and a sharp cry emitted.</p><p>“I got it,” Agatha said, moving to stand.</p><p>“No, I’ll get him.” Rio placed a hand on Agatha’s knee as she got up. Agatha prayed no one would notice her blush.</p><p>“What did I tell you?” Lilia replied. “Married.”</p><p>“Lilia, please,” Agatha hissed. “This is not something to joke about. That goes for all of you.”</p><p>“You literally texted me about how the two of them were ruining your slee-“ Jen was interrupted by Agatha waving her hands around.</p><p>“That was in the before-times, when I didn’t know Rio and Nicky.”</p><p>Agatha’s face turned bright red as the two people she spoke about came around the corner. Nicky was clearly up and alert, gazing around the room until he saw her and tried to break free from Rio’s hold. “He was feeling left out.”</p><p>Agatha extended her arms and accepted the happy baby who quickly settled in the crook of her neck. He’d also grabbed onto a strand of her long hair, but didn’t seem to want to pull it, so she allowed it. For now.</p><p>“He likes you,” Lilia stated, as though her opinion was the nail in the coffin on Nicky liking her or not.</p><p>“He does,” Agatha murmured.</p><p>“So,” Jen began, “you’re a first-time mom?”</p><p>“First time everything, really,” Rio replied. “Have you two thought about kids?” she added, sitting back down beside Agatha.</p><p>“Definitely one or two,” Alice replied. “Just kinda more expensive when you can’t DIY them.”</p><p>Jen caught Agatha rolling her eyes and echoed their conversation from days ago. “Anatomy book.”</p><p>“Huh?” Her fiancé asked.</p><p>“Agatha knows what I mean.”</p><p>“I do,” Agatha said. But any real bite she would’ve had was lost when Nicky yawned on her shoulder and snuggled in deeper.</p><p>“The bambino is tired.” Lilia stood and began to clear plates. “I’ll do this while you put him to bed again.”</p><p>“Do you want me to-“ Rio tried.</p><p>“He’s fine,” Agatha replied quickly. “I’ll hold him. Thanks, Lilia."</p><p>“Speaking of,” Alice tried again after a not-so-subtle nudge from Jen. “How’d Nicky come into your life, Rio?”</p><p>“He was cost-effective,” Rio deadpanned, causing Alice to grin.</p><p>“So…husband?” Jen asked outright.</p><p>Rio chuckled. “No. I’m queer as a three-dollar bill. Nicky was adopted-“</p><p>“Still expensive,” Jen interjected.</p><p>“From family,” Rio finished. She glanced over at Agatha, who’d shown no expression.</p><p>“Makes sense,” Alice replied. “He looks like you.”</p><p>As if he could sense what the room was talking about, Nicky wriggled in Agatha’s arms before letting out a sharp cry.</p><p>Agatha tried soothing him, but it was clear he wanted Rio. She passed him over, but he continued to let his complaints be known. “I think we’re heading out,” Rio said, standing and moving towards the stroller at the edge of the room.</p><p>“That’s our cue too,” Jen said, tugging on Alice’s arm.</p><p>“Great party,” Alice added. “Dip was delicious.”</p><p>Agatha watched as a flurry of activity happened around her. Jackets were put on, and hugs were given, and at one point, she heard Alice let Rio know about a cover-up. The only one who had stood still was Lilia, but Agatha knew she could get her out sooner rather than later.</p><p>Once her apartment was quiet, she sighed and leaned her forehead against the door.</p><p>“You know,” Lilia began, taking her time to gather her things, “this is clearly the beginning of something. But you may have to break free of the road you’re on to get to where you want to go.”</p><p>“I don’t think I have the brain capacity for a riddle right now.”</p><p>“You know what I mean,” she said with an added glare. “You make a very bad fool, Agatha.”</p><p>And with that, Lilia left her alone with her thoughts and some leftover empanadas.</p>

<p>Agatha skimmed the email in front of her again as a part of her somewhat blacked out the first time she read the words <i>Congratulations! The university received a call, and an anonymous alumni donor has decided to fund your research for-</i></p><p>She couldn’t believe Rio’s suggestion to mingle had actually worked. Agatha checked her messages to find Jen and Alice’s quick reply to the news.<i>Congrats! Rain check? It’s date night. </i> from Alice and a much longer, more detailed message from Jen containing basically the same information, and also a question asking if Agatha had seen her purple top, which definitely was not currently sitting in her laundry basket.</p><p>It was very last-minute, sure, but Agatha wanted to head out and do <i>something</i> to celebrate.</p><p>Three failed calls to Lilia told her that the woman was either at a retreat or had lost her phone yet again. Agatha sighed as her thumb hovered over another name.</p><p>It has been about a week and a half since poker night, which was the last time she’d seen Rio, but she’d received two coffees on her doorstep since. One with a note that thanked her for including Rio and Nicky on Friday morning, and another, the following Wednesday morning, with just a smiley face on it.</p><p>Agatha bit the bullet, and after two rings, a familiar voice answered. “Hello?”</p><p>“Hi, hey, hi,” Agatha replied, trying different intonations with each. “How are you?”</p><p>“I’m good,” Rio said. Agatha could imagine the soft smile on her lips.</p><p>“That’s good.” She heard something clatter on Rio’s end. “You okay?”</p><p>“Yeah, I’m, um…” Rio trailed off for a second. “I’m at dinner.”</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha replied. “I thought I’d heard Nicky through the wall a while ago, sorry.”</p><p>“Don’t be,” Rio sighed. “You probably <i>did</i>. I hired a sitter.”</p><p>“Oh. <i>Oh</i>,” Agatha’s eyes widened a bit. “Are you on a date or something?” she joked.</p><p>There was a silence, giving Agatha a chance to pick up on the clinking of silverware on a platter and people chattering on. “I am.”</p><p>“Oh, I see, um, I’m so sor-“</p><p>“Is everything okay? Are you okay? Is it Nicky?”</p><p>“Everything’s fine,” Agatha reassured her. “I’m fine. I just got good news and wanted to celebrate with someone, but I didn’t realize you were on a date. Sorry.”</p><p>After a beat, the background noise on Rio’s end quieted. “What’s the good news?” she asked softly.</p><p>“You remember that schmoozing event I had to go to a while back?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Mhm.”</p><p>“Someone there, I assume, liked my research so much that it’s fully funded next year.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio sighed out. “That’s incredible. Congratulations, seriously.”</p><p>Agatha ignored the heat that suddenly pooled in her stomach. “Thanks, um, anyways, I’ll let you get back to…your date then.”</p><p>“It’s not that exciting.”</p><p>“She must be special to have gotten you to take the night off.”</p><p>“We met at a bar in the before-Nicky times. I was…a different person.”</p><p>Agatha hummed in response but said nothing.</p><p>“How about we do something to celebrate tomorrow?”</p><p>“Yeah, sure,” she replied. “Have fun with…whoever’s there,” was added flatly.</p><p>“Thanks,” Rio whispered before the call ended.</p><p>Agatha ignored the tears pricking in her eyes. It wasn’t her first time celebrating a major accomplishment alone. And she knew the universe didn’t owe her anything.</p><p>She would be <i>fine</i>. It’s just how life was.</p><p>Rerouting herself from the kitchen, Agatha turned to her home office. She kept the good liquor in a bar cart there, mostly because of the aesthetics of having a bottle of very expensive scotch, gifted to her by her employer of all things, beside the custom-built bookshelves that were definitely worth losing her security deposit in this building.</p><p>The upside of having handy queer grad students, apart from the fact that they were good at research, is that they were also good at building sets for plays and musicals and Ikea furniture and would do anything for some extra cash over their summers. Like, say, building a custom bookcase in their professor’s home.</p><p>Agatha gave herself a generous, celebratory pour and sighed at the first sip of it. The pleasant burn warmed her up inside.</p><p>She made her way back to her fridge, realizing that, within the last few weeks of the semester, she’d let grocery shopping fall to the wayside. After pulling her phone out, and a <i>very</i> tempting offer of free delivery from Taco Bell, there was a knock on her door.</p><p>She perked up, looking towards it, before coming to the conclusion that she made it up. As she clicked away from the delivery app, the knock returned, louder this time.</p><p>Her brow furrowed, and she crossed her space before looking out the peephole. There, Rio stood, chest heaving slightly, with a brown paper bag held in her hands. “Agatha,” she called out.</p><p>Agatha swung the door open. “Hi.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth opened as she took a sharp inhale. “Your hair.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand rose to touch it. What had been a perfect high bun this afternoon had gone all the way down since she’d arrived home, replaced by something akin to a lion’s mane. “Oh, yeah. I didn’t brush it. Sor-“</p><p>“<i>Don’t</i>,” Rio replied bluntly before clearing her throat and looking away, almost embarrassed. “Sorry, didn’t mean to be so aggressive, it’s just-...you look good.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Agatha said. Her eyes turned downwards towards what Rio was carrying. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>Rio looked back at her, poking her tongue against the inside of her cheek before smiling. “I heard we were celebrating. I was in the neighborhood.”</p><p>“You were on a date.”</p><p>It was clear Rio hadn’t lied. She wore a black blouse tucked into the same color trousers and felt just slightly taller than usual to Agatha. Her hair was also the most glossy Agatha had seen it.</p><p>If Agatha saw her at a bar, she’d probably hit on Rio too.</p><p>“In the neighborhood,” Rio added. “Mind if I come in?”</p><p>Agatha took a step back and extended her hand, still clutching the tumbler now less than half-filled with amber liquid. Rio's eyes zoned in on it. “Do you want me to pour you one?”</p><p>“Please,” Rio replied, moving into her kitchen. “Where are your plates?” she yelled out at Agatha across the apartment.</p><p>“Next to the fridge,” she yelled back. Agatha followed the exact motions she’d taken barely 20 minutes ago and returned to Rio.</p><p>“Thanks,” Rio replied, taking it from her. She lifted it up, tilting it slightly towards Agatha. “To you. And to your funding and all of the accomplishments to come from it.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t care how hard she was blushing at this very moment. She nodded in thanks and took another sip, simultaneously with Rio.</p><p>“Whoo,” Rio huffed out. “That’s good.”</p><p>“Did you leave your date?” Agatha asked bluntly with all the finesse of a bull in a china shop.</p><p>“I…may have led her to believe there had been an emergency.”</p><p>“An emergency where you needed to box your food up?”</p><p>“Technically, I got this from the hostess, not my server, so she didn’t see it.”</p><p>“Uh-huh.”</p><p>“It wasn’t that great of a date anyway. She mostly complained about her job. And I think at one point she even said she didn’t like kids.”</p><p>“That’s not very first-date material.”</p><p>Rio went red. “<i>Technically</i>, this was like the third date. But it was very casual. And I don’t think I’ll see her again. She wasn’t my type. It was all-”</p><p>Agatha lifted a hand and took another sip. “You don’t have to explain yourself to me,” she said after a pause.</p><p>“Yeah, right,” Rio replied weakly. “Um, anyways, I got the rest of my lasagna to go and another pasta with just sauce and veggies. There’s tiramisu in here too, which I assumed you’d like, since, you know, the coffees.”</p><p>“I do,” Agatha nodded, adding, “like tiramisu, I mean.”</p><p>“Oh, good.” Rio moved around the space with a nervous energy as Agatha just watched. She was still in disbelief at the other woman’s appearance. “The food is still warm, but I can heat it up if you want it hotter.”</p><p>“I’m sure it’s fine.”</p><p>“Great,” Rio replied, a bit louder than necessary. “Sorry, I think I’m just-,” she shook her hands out in front of her. “Just left over energy. From the date.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. She’d seen Rio in many forms, but she didn’t think flustered had been one of them. “Right. From the date.”</p><p>“Uhhuh.” Rio turned back to the takeout containers. “Do you want to watch something while we eat? Or actually use the table in here?”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “That’s mostly there for decoration.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Movie?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes as she grabbed her plate. “It’s just me,” she said, brushing past Rio.</p><p>“Yeah, I know,” Rio whispered back, mostly to herself.</p><p>They sat on Agatha’s couch, eating and half-paying attention to the reality tv show Agatha hit play on. “They’re all already famous.”</p><p>“Like…influencers?” Rio asks.</p><p>“Some of them. But usually they get famous by being on other shows, and then they get to this castle and start betraying each other.”</p><p>At some point, the show fell to the wayside, and they began to catch up. Agatha spoke more about her research, and Rio’s genuine excitement for her bled throughout the interaction, making her blush at every turn and hide behind her bowl of pasta.</p><p>In return, she learned that Nicky was babbling a lot more often and had stood up in the middle of crawling two days ago. Rio was sure he’d be walking very soon. Agatha smiled softly. “We should do something to celebrate him.”</p><p>Rio laughed and agreed and, soon, their empty plates were long forgotten on the coffee table. Rio reached over and paused the show, legs tucked under herself, a hand in her hair, and elbow leaning on the back of the couch.</p><p>Agatha turned to mirror her. Rio smiled, but it didn’t quite reach her eyes. “What?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“This is the first time tonight where I haven’t thought about needing to go and check on him.”</p><p>Agatha’s brows rose slightly. “Is that a good thing?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio replied with a shrug. “I think so. I was so worried about Nicky earlier and, even when I got here, I wanted to stop by and check on him.”</p><p>“But you didn’t.”</p><p>“I wasn’t even sure if he was awake. I mean, I hope he wasn’t awake, it was past his bedtime.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “I think that…<i>worry</i> of what they’re doing never really goes away. No matter how much you trust the babysitter.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly and gave her a funny look. “It’s Lilia.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“The babysitter,” Rio said. “Lilia’s in my apartment right now. Something about wanting to be a Nonna. I…trust her. And yet…”</p><p>“And yet,” Agatha echoed. “You left your kid. You have a right to be worried.”</p><p>Rio looked down, dropping her hand to draw nonsensical patterns on the soft couch fabric with her fingers. “He’s my brother’s.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha replied gently. She set her hand close to Rio’s, but not touching. She wouldn’t make that decision for the other woman.</p><p>But Rio took it anyway, thumb now stroking across Agatha’s knuckles. “I got the call about two weeks before I met you. Car accident. A big pileup, really. He’d been at the wrong place, wrong time.”</p><p>Agatha sucked in a breath as Rio continued.</p><p>“Nicky too. He was in the backseat but survived somehow. It’s why all of his doctors are at the university.”</p><p>“Best child trauma specialists,” Agatha echoed, remembering the banners the medical school always had up.</p><p>Rio nodded. “It was a surprise, to say the least. My brother and I weren’t really close. He and my parents…made their choices when I first came out.”</p><p>“My mom did the same,” Agatha said dryly in a way that didn’t offer sympathy, but understanding. She paused, trying to find the right words. “Was he Nicky’s only parent?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio nodded again. “His biological mom is unreliable. She has…her own issues. It took us almost a month to find her.”</p><p>“<i>Us</i>?”</p><p>That question seemed to bring some levity to Rio. “Believe it or not, they don’t just hand you a kid when their parent dies. The government <i>did</i> need me to legally adopt Nicky.”</p><p>“Smartass,” Agatha mumbled under her breath, causing Rio to smile gently.</p><p>“It sounds bad to say it out loud, but she seemed relieved to know it would be me taking care of him. Signed off on everything the same day we met.”</p><p>“So it’s you then,” Agatha replied resolutely.</p><p>“Not just me,” Rio added quickly. “We have you now. My co-worker, who was busy tonight, also loves Nicky. And Jen and Alice, who say they call dibs next time because they want to be the cool aunts and-“</p><p>“You could’ve asked me to babysit.”</p><p>Rio moved her hand to interlace their fingers. “I could’ve. But Lilia said yes after the first ring.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes at the fact that her friend had not lost her phone but was simply ignoring her, next door, in order to spend time with Nicky. Not that she blamed her. “That woman.”</p><p>“I think she has a sixth sense.” Agatha’s head tilted in question as Rio said, “She told me that I could come running back at any time and that she’d still take care of the baby until midnight.”</p><p>Agatha hummed in response. “So you have your village. Which may or may not include a clairvoyant witch.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio sighed out, feeling tears pricking in the corner of her eyes. “I do.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha murmured, shuffling closer until her knees were pressed against Rio’s thighs. She lifted her other hand to Rio’s cheek, gently pressing until dark brown eyes were looking into hers deeply.</p><p>“You’re not what I was expecting,” Rio whispered into the space shrinking between them. “When you came over that first time, I thought you were gonna bite my head off.”</p><p>“Only if you ask nicely,” Agatha replied.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said, eyes glassy and tooth-gapped smile catching Agatha’s attention.</p><p>“You’re not what I expected either.”</p><p>“Weren’t expecting a blubbery mess who wanted to celebrate you tonight?”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “You’re not a mess.”</p><p>Rio hummed in a way that meant Agatha was left to internally agree to disagree. She held on to Agatha’s wrist with her own, their tangled hands in her lap, head leaning back. They gazed at each other, studying eyes and lips and noses unabashedly, Agatha’s thumb running across the soft skin under her eye absentmindedly.</p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>“Can I..” Agatha trailed off, tilting her head to the side in a silent question.</p><p>“Not yet,” Rio sighed.</p><p>At that, Agatha bristled. “<i>Not yet?</i>”</p><p>She pulled away, but Rio gently kept hold of her, which meant she could go as far as the couch cushion over. “It’s been a long night.”</p><p>“<i>So?</i>” Agatha tried again, sounding like a petulant child.</p><p>“I don’t want to do anything you regret.”</p><p>“I won’t. You won’t.”</p><p>“I just…I need a second. Not a never, just a not now.”</p><p>Agatha’s shoulders relaxed slightly. “Fine.”</p><p>“I was on a date with another woman like an hour ago.”</p><p>“Don’t have to remind me.”</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “You don’t have to apologize.”</p><p>“I’m still-“ before Rio could say whatever it was she was going to say, a piercing wail cut through Agatha’s walls. “Oh, you weren’t kidding. He’s <i>loud</i>.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Worse the closer you get.”</p><p>“Oh god,” Rio said, cheeks bright red and eyes unfocused, almost as if she was trying to map out where in her home Nicky was crying. “This is awful.”</p><p>“I got over it,” Agatha replied with a wink. Just because she was slightly upset didn’t mean she wasn’t bringing her A game. “Anyways, I think you're right.”</p><p>“About what?”</p><p>“You’ve been through a lot tonight. I’ve had my own things,” Agatha continued on. “And I have my own baggage, so yeah, let’s take it slow.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio said, nodding slowly. “That…is good.”</p><p>“Great,” Agatha replied, untangling herself from Rio. “Let me walk you out.”</p><p>Rio followed her through the apartment, slightly confused at what had just happened and how quickly Agatha cycled through her emotions. Once they were at the door, Rio turned to say something which was all but forgotten after the words <i>I’ll see you tomorrow</i> were accompanied with a soft kiss on the cheek, followed by a slammed door.</p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose, trying to keep all of her feelings from spilling out of her chest. Rio was right, they’d had a long, <i>unexpected</i> night together. Rio had the baby. Rio had a lot of roles, actually. And Agatha would have her moment. She had…things to be discussed. They would need time.</p><p>Still, Agatha felt like a teenager who wanted to jump out of their skin at the fact that their crush liked them.</p><p>Oh god, she <i>liked</i> Rio. <i>Whatever</i>, Agatha thought to herself. <i>There’s time</i>.</p><p>+++</p><p>Agatha woke up to a text from Rio asking if she was free the following afternoon. If she replied quickly, that was no one’s business but her own. Her morning was fairly uneventful, mostly catching up on the work she ignored last night, followed by a workout class that kept her sane. She needed to move her body to the world’s loudest pop music or else her mind would offer the worst of thoughts up on a silver platter.</p><p>After showering and spending <i>way</i> too much time trying to figure out what one wore to a winter market, she marched over to Rio’s door and knocked.</p><p>What greeted her on the other side made her almost double over in laughter. Rio had somehow found a coat that matched Nicky’s dark navy snowsuit, fuzzy hood and all, and had him strapped to her chest once more. “You love that thing, don’t you?” Agatha asked, gesturing to her front.</p><p>Rio gave her a weird look. “Yeah, I’m pretty attached to Nicky.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “The <i>carrier</i>.”</p><p>“Yeah, I’m attached to myself too.” That got her a nonsensical grabby hand floating just off her side. “Hello, to you too.”</p><p>“Hi,” Agatha replied, slightly exasperated. “And hello, Nicholas.”</p><p>At his name, the baby made a high-pitched squeal. “Ready to go?” Rio added.</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Need any help?” Rio wordlessly passed over the diaper backpack she usually had on, and they headed off.</p><p>The nice thing about Westview being a college town is that the off-campus suburbs felt very much like a small TV town. They had seasonal markets and events and a gazebo that would put Gilmore Girls to shame, just a few blocks away from their building. Similarly, the holiday market was packed with vendors and food stalls. Rio recommended they start with the vendors and work their way towards the food.</p><p>“Lead the way,” Agatha replied, getting slightly jostled by all of the passerbys.</p><p>Rio used the moment to grab her hand. Agatha’s brows rose slightly, but she offered no comment. They walked deeper into the crowd, just happy to browse and offer opinions. Rio managed to get a few laughs out of Agatha, which she thought were the best gift she’d gotten here so far.</p><p>“Anyone special you’re shopping for, dear?” an old woman called out to Rio from a jewelry stall.</p><p>She shook her head no. “Just looking around.”</p><p>The woman’s eyes dropped for a split second before she looked back up. “I have a collection of vintage engagement rings.”</p><p>Agatha felt herself turn bright red as Rio, still holding her hand, stammered out, “We’re just friends.”</p><p>“If you say so, dear,” the woman responded. “Take my card anyway,” she said, handing the piece of cardstock over. “I have a brick-and-mortar place a few blocks away. You might need it someday.”</p><p>When they pulled away, Rio glanced over at Agatha. She squeezed her hand once to get her attention before speaking. “I swear, I didn’t say anything.”</p><p>“It’s alright,” Agatha replied, looking straight ahead at a woman who was smiling right at the two of them.</p><p>Standing a few feet away was a blonde who had turned at the sound of Rio’s voice. She waved before nudging the brunette beside her, who leaned over some type of candle. Rio smiled and tugged Agatha towards them before releasing her hand, causing Agatha to feel a pang of disappointment.</p><p>“Hi Nicky,” the blonde cried out, moving to hug Rio and the baby. “How are you guys doing?”</p><p>Rio smiled. “We’re great. Out celebrating his ability to crawl.”</p><p>“And you honor that by forcing him to be carried around on this device.”</p><p>“Rio loves the baby bjorn,” Agatha interjected, her voice coming out a bit louder than she anticipated. “She told me herself.”</p><p>The blonde looked amused but said nothing. “I’m Kate,” said the woman beside her, giving a cartoonish wave.</p><p>Rio’s eyes lit up at the name. “Oh! Yelena’s told me so much about you.” The two blushed at Rio, and Agatha couldn’t understand why she felt like she was seeing red. “How are you liking the new house?”</p><p>“It’s…” Kate was clearly trying to find the right words before the blonde, Yelena, Agatha assumed, jumped in.</p><p>“She’s getting used to it. I still tell her there are no ghosts.”</p><p>Kate rolled her eyes as Agatha’s arm found the crook of Rio’s elbow. She was pressed up against the other woman, the closest she’d been to Rio. Rio simply glanced at her with a smirk, and Agatha scowled in return.</p><p>“There are definitely ghosts,” Kate replied. “Like, statistically, there <i>have</i> to be ghosts in that house.”</p><p>“There are no ghosts in there,” Yelena argued back, gasping as if she was preparing to give a much longer retort.</p><p>“How rude of me,” Rio said, tongue poking against the side of her cheek for a second. “Agatha,” she added slowly, “This is my co-worker, Yelena, and her girlfriend, Kate, who just moved into the funeral home with her.”</p><p>Despite Agatha’s shoulders sagging slightly in relief, she did not let go of Rio. “Oh, um, nice to meet you.”</p><p>Yelena gave her a sharp nod. “Likewise.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Kate smiled widely at her. “Hence, ghosts.” She waved a hand around her head as though that was the motion for whatever spirits were around.</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips. “I’m with you. There probably are ghosts in there.”</p><p>Kate inhaled sharply. “<i>Thank you</i>,” she said, turning to Yelena. “See?!”</p><p>“Hmm.” Yelena scrunched her face. “Probably the nice kind then.”</p><p>“Except for the ones that locked you in the upstairs bathroom and made you climb out the window, which later required firemen,” Rio chimed in. “Like getting a cat out of a tree.”</p><p>Yelena shot Rio a look. “I believe that wasn’t a ghost, but some type of hazing ritual.”</p><p>“I did haze you,” Rio admitted, “but only that one time when I put your training dummy in drag. The locking of the door was all the ghosts’ fault.”</p><p>“Nicky, back me up here,” Yelena tried. Kate snickered at her girlfriend’s need to bring the baby into the argument.</p><p>Nicky was definitely not locked into the action and, instead, had found Agatha’s hand on Rio’s arm. He was attempting to pull her fingers off the other woman in order to play with them.</p><p>“Sorry,” Rio said. “Nicky’s kind of obsessed with Agatha. She’s been helping out here and there.”</p><p>“It’s been going well, then?” Yelena asked.</p><p>Rio shrugged. “We have good and bad days. But overall, I think once I find a regular sitter, I’ll be back at work.”</p><p>“I didn’t know you were looking for a sitter,” Agatha murmured, just for Rio’s ears.</p><p>Yelena shook her head quickly. “Not what I asked and not what I meant.”</p><p>“It’s been fine,” Rio replied, a bit more gently than Agatha had seen her speak before, “It’s…worked to take it day by day.”</p><p>“Good,” Yelena said as though something had been finalized. “Good.”</p><p>After a beat of silence amongst the four of them, Kate’s smile widened a bit. “It’s been nice seeing you.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio replied, clearing her throat. “You too.”</p><p>“Nice to meet you,” Agatha added, her focus fully pulled by Nicholas.</p><p>There were goodbyes and hugs exchanged and a promise of performing admin work from Rio before the couple parted ways with Rio and Agatha.</p><p>“She lives in the mortuary?” Agatha asked finally.</p><p>“That’s what I said.”</p><p>“And she’s also gay?”</p><p>Rio huffed. “A lot of alternative people are gay. A lot of alternative people study mortuary sciences. We just so happened to be one and the same.”</p><p>“Aww,” Agatha replied, lifting her hand from Nicky’s to Rio’s cheek. She patted it softly and patronizingly. “It’s cute you think you’re as cool as the woman I just met.”</p><p>She let go of Rio and, after a few steps forward, heard a delayed “<i>Hey!</i></p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio had always considered one of her strongest traits to be her perseverance.</p><p>Have a family who cuts you out because you’re gay? Never return home. Get collegiate scholarships, get weird off campus jobs, get lucky through student health therapy, and do better than you ever expected. Work your ass off until you’re considered to be successful in your field.</p><p>Have said family dump a baby in your lap over ten years later? Consider that the best way to honor the brother you might’ve once had (and to get <i>some</i> revenge) is to raise the kid in a way they’d never understand; in a home that loves unconditionally.</p><p>Have a murderous looking brunette with a gorgeous nose and the sharpest jawline knock on your door at three in the morning? Well, invite the killer in. Let her hold your baby.</p><p>In short, Rio was never someone who assumed that there wasn’t a way out. A solution. But now, she was starting to change her mind.</p><p>It started a few days after she’d grabbed lunch with Agatha. The two of them agreed that a meal where Nicky was mid-nap in between Agatha’s classes was decidedly <i>not</i> date-like.</p><p>Still, Agatha said she had some sort of presentation that morning when she showed up in a brown suit, while Rio did the parental equivalent and chose a hoodie that did not have any type of spit up and dark jeans that accentuated some of her better assets. There might’ve been some footsie played under the table and a bill that was fully paid by Agatha saying she wanted to get her back for all the coffees but it was just semantics.</p><p>Taking it slow wasn’t a problem, in Rio’s mind, rather, now that she decided what she wanted, she didn’t know how to execute it. In the past, Rio was usually someone who made very distinctive decisions. Dead or alive. Hot or cold. Welcomed or cut out. No room for in betweens.</p><p>And then, suddenly, Agatha was entirely in the grey area.</p><p>“They call it the talking stage,” Agatha provided for her.</p><p>“What?” Rio replied, confused. It was another one of their middle of the day not-dates.</p><p>Agatha had messaged her, asking if she wanted to go for a walk around campus. It was cold but not unpleasant and Rio figured that if she bundled Nicky up well he would feel like he was taking the coziest nap in the best air conditioned room, so she agreed.</p><p>“Talking,” Agatha repeated.</p><p>Rio’s brow furrowed. “We <i>are</i> talking to each other right now.”</p><p>“No, I know,” Agatha replied with a gentle eyeroll. “But I asked the kids and-“</p><p>“You told your <i>students</i> about <i>us</i>?”</p><p>Agatha sighed as she pushed the stroller along, ignoring Rio’s confusion. “No, of course not. Someone in the front row mentioned how I had two students dating. And I said I didn’t care and that their final exam was in a week, but then they told me it was two of my TAs and I marched right up to Billy and asked him.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“According to William,” Agatha said, “he and Eddie are not dating. They are talking. I asked what the hell <i>that</i> meant and he said it was the stage where you like a person but before you determine whether you want to date them. You <i>talk</i>.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>“He insists this talking thing won’t impact his ability to help me grade and that it’s helpful but can also feel like a new circle of hell.”</p><p>“Right,” Rio replied. After a beat, she added, “at thirty-two, I don’t really feel like I’m supposed to be following the advice of teens.”</p><p>“He loves to remind me he’s twenty-one,” Agatha grumbled. “Besides, if you can’t, how could I? Hm?”</p><p>Rio hadn’t asked Agatha’s age because Rio wasn’t a dumbass. She could guess the other woman was older, though she assumed not by much. “It makes you…their professor?”</p><p>“I’m ten years older than you,” Agatha replied, very matter of factly.</p><p>Rio sighed internally and also pocketed away the thoughts of being with an older woman, being with <i>Agatha</i> who just so happened to be that much older. <i>That</i> made her head go dizzy with want.</p><p>They ambled by a bench just outside of a playground, usually filled with student teachers, professors, and their kids, and sat. A few, red-faced bundled-up children ran around, not caring that the metal playground equipment was probably freezing in the dead of winter.</p><p>“Talking, then?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha sighed out. “I guess.”</p><p>“Would you want to do eating at some point? Or are we limited to one verb at a time?” Rio asked, eyes following a tiny girl in a bright pink puffer squealing as she slid down the slide.</p><p>Agatha nudged her with her elbow. “Don’t be a smartass. I can eat.”</p><p>“Are you free tomorrow night?”</p><p>There was a beat and then a slow, “No, I have dinner plans with Lilia.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Rio could feel Agatha turn to face her fully, so she did the same. “Okay?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said with a nod. “Another time then.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes searched hers for something Rio assumed she couldn’t find. “How are you so…calm all of the time?”</p><p>Rio huffed out a laugh. “Trust me, I’m not.”</p><p>“Please,” Agatha replied, “you must have the blood pressure of, like, a very stoned surfer or a yogi on a meditation retreat.”</p><p>“Your mind is fascinating to me.”</p><p>“<i>Rio</i>,” Agatha said, breaking her name up into two sing-songed syllables that made her stomach flip.</p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio replied. “You’ve unlocked my tragic backstory-“</p><p>“Oh my god,” Agatha mumbled.</p><p>“So you know I’ve cracked under pressure before,” Rio continued. “And now I just handle it.”</p><p>“Oh, you <i>handle it</i>, do you?”</p><p>Rio blushed. “There are children present.”</p><p>“I haven’t said anything.” Agatha flexed a hand up as though waving away her words.</p><p>Rio broke out into a grin and <i>definitely</i> noticed how Agatha’s eyes swooped down to her lips before staring back at her.</p><p>Before Rio could say anything dumb like, confess how much she <i>like</i> liked Agatha in the middle of the playground, another voice chimed in. “You guys are such a cute family,” a dark-haired woman called out, holding a young girl’s hand.</p><p>The kid must’ve been eight, maybe nine, but Rio was bad at ages. She glanced over at Agatha whose mouth was wobbling open with no words coming out. “Thank you,” Rio chimed.</p><p>The woman smiled brightly and continued speaking. “I’m actually a part of a queer parent support group that meets over at the university library and we’re looking for-“</p><p>“I’m not his mom,” Agatha practically yelled out. The two looked startled at the outburst, the stranger more so, before Agatha cleared her throat and repeated, “I’m not his mother.”</p><p>The woman’s smile dropped slightly. “You mean…biologically? I wouldn’t worry. We actually have workshops on those feelings. It’s why I’m-“</p><p>Agatha stood abruptly. Brusquely. So unlike Rio had ever seen her. “I have to go,” she announced.</p><p>Rio tried to stand but Agatha placed a hand on her shoulder, anchoring her to the bench. She was fully turned away from the stranger and Rio could tell she was panicking. “I’ll text you?” Rio offered quietly.</p><p>Agatha nodded once, sharp, jaw tight, and glanced back at Nicky, still sleeping in his stroller, before quickly walking away.</p><p>“If I said something, or did something…” the woman trailed off.</p><p>Rio shook her head. “You’re fine. It’s just…personal stuff, I think.”</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>“If you have a flyer or a number for the group, I’ll take it though.” The woman’s shoulders eased and they exchanged contact information before saying their goodbyes.</p><p>The sun was a bit low on the horizon already, so Rio stood and began the walk back to her car with Nicky. He’d finally woken up and was now just staring up at Rio, his brow eyes trying to find their identical counterpart.</p><p>Rio sighed, the puff of air coming out like smoke from a chimney, as she passed a large lecture hall. She thought about Agatha and how her anxiety seemed to sky rocket when the woman, Monica, had mentioned them being a family. Rio hadn’t always been the most emotionally intelligent person on the planet, but she could tell when someone had their fight or flight kick in.</p><p>Agatha was flight, clearly, though there had been a moment where things seemed like they could go the other way. Rio tried to shake the thought of Agatha somehow lifting someone up with just her mind and remembered a tiny piece of something Lilia had said after her babysitting stint.</p><p>Rio had paid her and was closing her door before the older woman lodged herself in the doorway as her eyes went wide. “Remember, patience.”</p><p>Rio nodded kindly, tired from her night, and tried to have her take her leave, but Lilia rolled her eyes and tried again.</p><p>“The day you plant the seed is not the day you eat the fruit.”</p><p>Rio had gawked at her, turned to look at the wild array of plants covering the apartment’s entrance alone, and then stared back at her. “I know.”</p><p>“Then you also know that some plants cannot grow alongside others. Root systems are very greedy and can grow tangled and mangled until you pull out the world’s tiniest carrot next to the world’s largest tomato,” Lilia added exasperatedly.</p><p>“Actually, those work well when you plant them side by side.” Lilia glared at her so Rio course corrected. “But I definitely get it. Plants need space to grow.”</p><p>She could tell she’d missed something, but Rio was tired and, it seemed, so was Lilia. She’d left shortly after and Rio had forgotten about the whole conversation, chalking it up to Lilia wanting agriculture advice from her in a convoluted way.</p><p>Now, however, she’d realized there had been something in there about Agatha, despite Rio having played it off as though her original date had kept away that evening longer than expected.</p><p>Breaking out of her trance, Rio realized she’d been standing next to her car for the last few minutes and, as though he could tell he was seconds away from a heater blasting at his car seat, Nicky began to fuss. She got him situated with minimal outburst, wrangled the monster of a stroller into her trunk, and sat in the driver's side, waiting for the car to warm up.</p><p>Rio pulled out her phone and, without preamble, texted Agatha. <i> Are you okay?</i></p><p>Quickly, three dots appeared and Rio’s heart beat in double time until they appeared. She saw them twice more in the span of a minute.</p><p>Finally, after the car was definitely warm and Rio was for sure at risk of getting stuck in rush hour traffic a single abbreviated response buzzed in.</p><p><i> dw</i></p><p>Rio felt deeply uncool looking up what that could’ve meant on urban dictionary and coming to the conclusion Agatha was telling her not to worry.</p><p>And, more importantly, she did worry a bit, because she couldn’t tell if, in this scenario, she was the carrot or the tomato.</p><p>She drove home, thankful that Nicky seemed to be calm after his afternoon excursion. Rio tried to focus on what she was doing instead of the pressing anxiety that seemed to currently loom over anything Agatha. Maybe this was the hellish part of “talking” that Agatha’s TA had brought up.</p><p>Nicky was fed and bathed before Rio set him down in the now no longer makeshift play area of her living room. She nestled herself in there with him, pulling out a few toys she thought wouldn’t rile him up too much before bed.</p><p>“Which would you like, sir?” Rio said, voice low, as though she were talking to some aristocrat and not a baby.</p><p>Nicky, who she was sure understood her, glanced at her and got on all fours, crawling before stopping halfway to Rio.</p><p>“Nicky?” She was confused. His face was determined and he was clearly trying to do <i>something</i>.</p><p>Suddenly, Nicky pushed himself up on his arms and legs, causing Rio to lunge forwards and stop just shy of him, creating a type of safety net in case he fell.</p><p>Nicky, now standing, looked up at her and gave a semi-gummy smile, a few teeth having come in within the last couple of weeks. Rio backed away slightly and he stared, taking one wobbly step forwards and then another.</p><p>Rio felt her eyes water. “Oh my god,” she gasped as he followed with two more steps before reaching Rio and collapsing in her arms. She peppered his face with kisses, much to his delight, all while praising him. “You’re such a smart, beautiful boy! Look at you! You’re walking all by yourself!”</p><p>Nicky giggled and she lifted him up even higher, much to his delight. Rio placed him back down on solid ground and smiled wide, Nicky babbling as he took another wobbly step back into her arms.</p><p>“Oh,” Rio cooed. “You just want to be next to me, huh?” Nicky grabbed onto her shirt tightly. “I hear you. Alright, how about we do a few more bedtime stories instead of playing?”</p><p>She moved in silence to the small nursery. That too had been upgraded. In the last few months, Rio had added a bigger crib and a cushioned rocking chair across from the changing table. She’d given up on getting her safety deposit by drilling and securing a tall bookcase that housed a steadily growing children’s book collection.</p><p>Rio first read one about dinosaurs then one about witches in Spanish before finishing it with a sleeping Nicky listening to Goodnight Moon. She placed him in his crib and watched him for a second.</p><p>A pang of melancholy hit her chest. She knew she was being slightly irrational but she couldn’t stop the train of thought that led her from <i>Nicky’s walking</i> to <i>Nicky’s gonna go to school and graduate some day</i> to <i>He’s not gonna need me anymore</i>.</p><p>A fresh batch of tears sprung in her eyes and she quickly grabbed her baby monitor before leaving the room. Once again, Rio remembered the first few days of taking care of Nicky and how clueless she’d been. She constantly scoured the mom reddit groups and any type of news article coming out with the best of anything and everything for your child.</p><p>But right now, there was really only one person whose opinion she cared about. One person who seemed to have all of the answers on childcare, even before Rio asked the question.</p><p>She pulled her phone out and typed a message out, hitting send quickly, without second-guessing herself. <i>Nicky took his first steps today</i>.</p><p>Agatha quickly replied. <i>cngts to him! r backflips next? or is that aftr he starts running?</i></p><p><i>Haha</i>, Rio typed back. <i> that’s in about fifteen years when he wants to give me my first and last heart attack</i>.</p><p>She could sense Agatha’s wry smile. <i>will make sure to bring fresh flowers to your grave every wk</i>.</p><p>Rio was glad no one could see her blush. She was sure Agatha didn’t intend for that to sound as romantic as it was to Rio, of all people. She just sent back a heart, expecting the conversation to end there.</p><p>Instead, there was another reply. <i>forgot 2 ask you a q from Jen (n Alice) today. what r u doing new years? how impossible would it be for u to get a bby sitter?</i></p><p><i>probably not impossible</i>, Rio said, finding it endearing how Agatha was probably mimicking the way her students texted each other, <i>and nothing. Why?</i></p><p><i>Jen n Alice r having a massive rager (aka more than 2 people over) and asked me 2 invite u.</i></p><p><i>I’d love to go!</i></p><p><i>g8, I’ll let them kno</i>.</p><p>Rio hesitated before sending another message. <i>What are you doing for Christmas?</i></p><p><i>belated celeb of yule w Lilia. burning a big log. y?</i></p><p><i>Want to come over in the morning? Celebrate Christmas with us?</i></p><p><i>just you n Nicky?</i></p><p><i>Just us.</i></p><p>She waited with bated breath before Agatha finally responded, <i>yea</i>.</p><p>+++</p><p>Rio got to the door on Christmas morning before Agatha could knock, which seemed like a good thing considering how much the other woman was struggling with the presents in her hands. “He’s not even a year old,” Rio said in greeting, taking some boxes out of her hands.</p><p>Agatha huffed. “He still deserves to rip open some gifts.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head towards the living room, where Agatha spotted the top of a small Christmas tree, since its body was mostly covered by presents. “I know.”</p><p>“Coffee?” Agatha asked once they’d arranged everything in a way that wouldn’t topple over.</p><p>“I’ll make some but first,” Rio said before nearly running down the hallway to her room and back. “Christmas pajamas. I had to guess sizes.”</p><p>Agatha looked down to find the same green long sleeve tee and green and white plaid bottoms Rio was wearing. “Bathroom?”</p><p>After pointing towards the right door, Rio heard a cry from Nicky and ran through his own morning routine quickly. He was in a full plaid onesie that matched her, and now Agatha’s, pants.</p><p>Rio cradled him against her as she turned the coffee maker on. She wasn’t an expert but she <i>had</i> splurged on a nice one after Yelena had upgraded the one at the funeral home and Rio realized she was essentially drinking sludge every morning.</p><p>She’d been trying, and sort of succeeding, in measuring everything with one hand before Agatha rejoined them. “How do I look?”</p><p>Rio let her eyes gaze down and really take in Agatha’s eyes and full lips, her messy hair tickling her collarbones, jutting out slightly under the shirt that’s taut across her chest, stomach soft and the curve of her hips melting her thoughts. Her brain was stupid and useless and, “Hot.”</p><p>Agatha smirked as a sharp eyebrow rose. “Hot?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Rio cleared her throat. “Like, um, hot in a good way but also in a don’t overheat way so really I’m just looking out for you like if you wanted to wear your t-shirt instead or something or-“</p><p>“I was just teasing,” Agatha replied, stepping forwards to grab Nicky, who’d extended his hands out towards her when he realized who it was. Traitor. “But that’s good to know.”</p><p>Rio felt herself turning nearly tomato red. “You know what you look like,” she grumbled.</p><p>“Oh, do I?” Agatha replied before waiting a beat. “You did a good job picking these out because you look good too.”</p><p>Rio hummed and returned to her work, finally able to move around easily. “I can make your fancy drink by the way.”</p><p>When Agatha didn’t respond quickly, Rio glanced over and found her studying Rio. “Thank you.”</p><p>“Mhm.” Rio tamped the ground coffee. “Do you want french toast? Or pancakes? Or eggs or something?” She fit the portafilter onto the machine, and was distracted by Agatha’s snort.</p><p>“Are you trying to run a B and B from your apartment?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Breakfast is a luxury experience.”</p><p>“Oh god, please don’t tell me you’re one of those people who skips breakfast. It’s not healthy, you know.”</p><p>“I’m usually a coffee drinker until I properly wake up. And I’m usually awoken by my stomach grumbling for lunch.”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“Relax. It’s worked out for me so far.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio replied, cleaning the steaming wand. “I just…I just want to make his first Christmas a really good one.”</p><p>Agatha moved to stand right beside her, not quite touching. “You will,” she whispered into the minimal space between them.</p><p>Rio turned and her breath hitched. Her body swayed forwards, without her meaning to, until Agatha placed a hand over hers. Nicky had curled himself up into Agatha’s neck, tiny fingers slowly moving back and forth across the base.</p><p>“Yeah, okay,” Rio said. Their quiet moment was interrupted by the spluttering of the espresso maker as liquid began to trickle down into a cup-less basin. “Shit.” Rio moved away as the moment broke to put the cup she’d left next to the machine just under it.</p><p>Agatha gasped as Nicky lifted his head. “Rio said a bad word,” she said to him. “Can you say shit?”</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>“What?” She replied innocently. “We’ve still got a bit before he actually talks back.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes playfully. “If that’s his first word, I’m blaming you,” she said, adding a cup under the machine and continuing her tasks.</p><p>Agatha hip-checked her and walked away into the living room area, meaning that Rio could now somewhat be focused on her task.</p><p>She managed to make the drinks and place them on the coffee table before they decided to let Nicky loose at his gifts. Rio sat on the floor with him ripping paper off of various boxes and grinning when it became incredibly clear that he’d gotten the hang of it.</p><p>He was a baby, sure, but Rio still spoke to him about all of the gifts he was opening. He’d been spoiled, having been the only baby most of her friends knew. Agatha smiled softly every time Nicky let out another squeal and Rio glanced up, like she was seeing her again for the first time.</p><p>When they got down to the last few under the tree, Rio grabbed a small box and settled herself besides Agatha. “Don’t know why you got him all of these gifts,” Agatha said warmly before taking a final sip of her coffee. “He’s so happy playing with the wrapping paper.”</p><p>And it was true, Nicky was throwing the crumpled pieces away from himself and watching it fall. Rio bumped her shoulder gently. “I guess that’s your roundabout way of saying you didn’t want a gift either?”</p><p>Agatha looked down at the small box being offered. “I’ll allow it.”</p><p>She took the box from a nervous Rio. “It’s not much, but, well, we just wanted to say thank you for- for being here for us this past year.”</p><p>Sheepishly, Agatha glanced over at her. “I didn’t get you anything.”</p><p>“That’s alright. It was really more Nicky’s idea.” She got a look but then Agatha turned back to the present so Rio took it as a win.</p><p>Agatha slipped the bow around it off and lifted the lid. Inside was a simple, clay ornament, painted purple, with Nicky’s handprint pressed to the center, and the words <i>Nicholas Vidal</i> in cursive underneath it. Her throat tightened and she ignored the tears that sprung in the corner of her eyes.</p><p>Rio wrapped an arm around her back, and hooked her chin on her shoulder. “Do you like it?”</p><p>Agatha turned, face splotchy, nose nearly brushing Rio’s. “I love it. Thank you.”</p><p>“Thank <i>you</i>,” Rio murmured.</p><p>In that split second, Agatha made a decision. She swooped down and pressed her lips to the corner of Rio’s, not enough for it to be a full kiss, but enough to feel the softness of the other woman’s lips.</p><p>Rio could feel her heart beat in double time. She was dazed by the almost kiss and gazed up at Agatha before tilting her head down and pressing another kiss against her clothed shoulder.</p><p>The two stayed like that, watching Nicky play, Rio’s head on Agatha’s shoulder and Agatha’s hand now holding onto Rio’s thigh, for a while.</p><p>+++</p><p>New Year’s Eve brought a fresh wave of anxiety for Rio.</p><p>The days between Christmas and now had been a haze full of a lot of homemade meals and leftovers, teaching Nicky how to play with his new toys, and…Agatha.</p><p>She’d been in Rio’s apartment from the time the sun came up until around 10 pm every night. To Rio, they’d essentially played house. They cooked together and binged the silliest reality tv shows or random christmas movies they could find. Rio tortured Agatha with a Star Wars movie marathon when she realized the older woman had never seen them. In retaliation, Agatha introduced Rio to the wonders of the real housewives. Often, Agatha brought things she was working on and would just sit quietly, Rio and Nicky in the foreground as she planned for the upcoming semester.</p><p>And through it all, there’d been almost no touching. Limited flirting. No more almost-kisses happened. It was like a platonic fog was obstructing any opportunity for romance between them.</p><p>And Rio was <i>fine</i>. She, of course, would respect any boundary line Agatha drew.</p><p>Like boundaries involving her need to shed her sweats after 8 pm one night when the heat in Rio’s apartment got finicky and her oversized t-shirt covered the tops of her thighs anyways. Rio simply ignored the soft, supple thighs almost touching her own for two hours on the couch before Agatha decided to head home.</p><p>Or boundaries involving her not just paying attention but actually caring for Nicky. Agatha would wave Rio away from tasks with a simple “I got him” or “my turn” which in no way tricked Rio’s mind into thinking about how nice it would be for Nicky to have another parent.</p><p>Or, Agatha’s latest boundary, which involved yearning glances that were quickly returned only for one or both of them to break and blush and have the other chuckle before turning back to whatever task they were handling.</p><p>Which led to New Year’s Eve. And led to Yelena insisting that she and Kate wanted a quiet night in and would love nothing more than to babysit Nicky so they could have a legitimate excuse in turning down their friends before crashing on Rio’s large inflatable mattress.</p><p>Rio stood outside Jen and Alice’s house in a sparkly, strappy cocktail dress and heels pulled from the depths of her closet, having heeded Agatha’s advice that, despite this being a house party, Jen was still going to send out a dress code recommendation and Pinterest board to match.</p><p>She rang the doorbell only for it to swing open a split second later, Agatha grinning at her while two people were already making out furiously behind her.</p><p>Rio’s brain short-circuited at the sight of Agatha in a jet black suit with only a black bra underneath her buttoned jacket.</p><p>“Wow,” Agatha said, eyes darting all over Rio. “You clean up nice.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “I’m having this weird sense of déjà vu.”</p><p>“Oh, are you?”</p><p>“I keep seeing you looking really handsome in all of the suits you own.”</p><p>Agatha blushed. “You saw me in sweats with spit up in my hair yesterday.”</p><p>“And yet,” Rio trailed off suggestively, purposefully letting Agatha see how her eyes dipped and rose to look back at her.</p><p>Agatha let out a shuddering breath, echoing. “And yet.”</p><p>The sound of shattering glass was overheard from the small crowd Rio assumed gathered deeper into the house before cheers erupted. “What kinda party is this?” she asked, walking in, past the couple who were now definitely in need of their own room.</p><p>“I think it’s the only one some people go to the entire year,” Agatha answered, following behind her. “Coat,” she said, pressing a hand on Rio’s shoulder as they passed a closet.</p><p>“Thanks,” Rio replied as Agatha helped her shrug it off and hung it up.</p><p>“Jen and Alice have been doing this for the last few years now,” Agatha continued. “And it’s only gotten bigger and bigger.”</p><p>“Drinks?” Rio asked, as she looked around the room. She caught Alice’s eyes, which lit up at the sight of her.</p><p>Alice quickly excused herself from the conversation and nearly slid over to her with socked feet. She was in a clearly dry cleaned white button down and with a leather harness over the top matching her leather pants. “You made it!”</p><p>“And you’re ready for bdsm night?”</p><p>“Ha ha,” Alice replied sarcastically. “Jen got me the outfit and I wasn’t about to complain to my fiancé because her vision makes me look hot as hell.”</p><p>Agatha, who had disappeared for a second, came back with some type of cocktail in a plastic cup and handed it to Rio. “I have to check in on something, but I’ll be back,” she whispered into her ear, hand briefly placed on the small of her back before pulling away.</p><p>Rio nodded, cheeks pink, and turned back to Alice who gave her a look before they both burst out laughing. “So, how’s wedding planning?”</p><p>They spoke for a while until Alice was pulled away by Jen, who <i>did</i> match her in a leather jumpsuit, and Rio searched the party for Agatha once more, but came up short.</p><p>She grabbed another drink, mindful of how strong Alice had made whatever punch she was drinking, and struck up conversation with some former university faculty and their partner for a bit who were intrigued by her own job.</p><p>After another round, she got pulled into a game of flip cup that turned into two that turned into some type of complicated drinking game with various tiers and people jumping up on couches and suddenly Rio realized she needed some air.</p><p>She stepped out into the backyard, only to find the woman she’d been searching for all night. Agatha was pacing along the edge of the small garden, amidst some trees.</p><p>As Rio got closer she realized Agatha was on the phone and she could hear part of her conversation.</p><p>“I just don’t get why you’re calling me and not him…yes, well we’ve <i>all</i> made our choices on that one…because <i>you</i> took that away from me.”</p><p>Rio tried to be quiet, but at some point, Agatha must’ve heard her coming. The panicked expression on her face made Rio reconsider any type of funny opening line. Her brow furrowed. “Hey.”</p><p>Agatha blocked the bottom of her phone with her hand, in a clear effort for whoever was on the other side to not hear them. “Now is really not a good time.”</p><p>“But I’ve wanted to see you all night,” Rio replied petulantly. She realized she might’ve been a bit drunker than she thought.</p><p>“I know, I’m sorry, I just-“</p><p>Agatha was cut off by Jen’s voice, loud enough that it could be heard through the backyard’s sliding glass door. “Five minutes to midnight! Go ahead and find whoooeeever it is you want to kiss at midnight!”</p><p>There was a mad scramble inside and Rio took another step forwards, then another, until she was cupping Agatha’s cheek in her hand. “Agatha?”</p><p>A single tear escaped Agatha’s eye as a tinny voice from the other side of the phone said <i> Agatha, who’s there?</i></p><p>“Are you okay?” Rio asked, unsure of what to do. “Is…is it…is it me?”</p><p>“No, baby,” Agatha sighed out.</p><p>The word bounced around Rio’s mind like a ping pong. <i>Baby, baby, baby.</i> “Then what’s…”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. She raised the phone up to her ear and said, “You can’t keep doing thi-“ Whatever interrupted her caused a defeated expression to ripple across her face before she replied. “Fine, Wanda. I’ll call you later.”</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio tried once more. But she simply burrowed herself into the crook of Rio’s shoulder, arms wrapped tightly around Rio’s waist, and began to weep. Big heaving cries came out as Rio rubbed her back and held on as tightly as she could.</p><p>Inside, Jen shouted out, “One minute!”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio murmured into her hair. “I can’t fix it if you don’t tell me what’s wrong.”</p><p>“I just…I just have to do something I’ve been putting off.” Agatha sounded garbled against Rio’s skin, and Rio pretended not to be affected by that.</p><p>“We can do it together. I’m sure it’s-“</p><p>“It’s across the country,” Agatha said quickly. She lifted herself up and the crowd inside went <i>ten</i>.</p><p>“I have miles. I can go with you.”</p><p><i>Nine</i></p><p>“Darling, it’s not about the miles. I have to go alone. It’s…”</p><p><i>Eight. Seven. Six.</i></p><p>The second pet name hit Rio in the chest, something warm blooming. “It’s what? It’s what? Whatever it is, I want to help.”</p><p><i>Five. Four.</i></p><p>“I have to go.”</p><p><i>Three.</i></p><p>“Agatha, please,” Rio pleaded.</p><p>“It’s a family emergency. I’m sorry.”</p><p><i>Two.</i></p><p>“Family emergency?”</p><p><i>One.</i></p><p>Agatha looked straight at her, eyes bloodshot and with a look Rio would later try to decipher and land on pity. “My…um…kids.”</p><p><i>Happy New Year!</i></p><p>The party inside erupted as Rio felt the world pull the rug out from under her. She stared, hard, at Agatha until the other woman walked just past her, turned and softly said, “Happy new year, Rio.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t say it back.</p>

<p>Agatha’s sadness boiled over into rage somewhere over the Rocky Mountains. After the party, she’d gone home to cry in her shower, hastily packed a bag, and wallowed in her uber to the airport. By the time her very expensive, last-minute flight landed in LAX on New Year’s Day she was tired, grumpy, and ready to pick a fight.</p><p>She’d sent Rio a slew of messages as she waited for the desk agent at the airport rental lot to figure out what she’d be driving, asking (really begging) Rio to call, but doubted they’d be seen any time soon. She’d at least managed to get the last car on the lot and drove directly to the address Wanda had sent her.</p><p>The GPS led her to the parking lot of a children’s hospital along the edges of another cookie cutter suburb where the grass seemed just a shade too green and the houses were all the same.</p><p>The minute Agatha walked in she bristled, the overly sanitized, cold hospital air hitting her senses. Something about it made her deeply uneasy.</p><p>“Hi,” she said to the nurse at the front desk. “I’m here for Thomas Maximoff.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, dear, visiting hours aren’t for another hour.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “I’m his mother.”</p><p>“Oh! But I though-“</p><p>“His <i>other</i> mother.”</p><p>Agatha’s annoyed expression must have tipped her off to the existence of queer people, because the confusion on the nurse’s face quickly changed to remorse. “Oh! Of course, sorry, Tommy Maximoff. And you’re-”</p><p>“Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>“Right, yes, you’re already on the approved visitors list I have here. I just need some I.D. and-“ She looked up at Agatha, already holding her license out. “Great, great,” she said, looking through files on the desk, “Room 8A, down the hall to your left, dear.”</p><p>“Thanks,” she replied flatly and turned towards the direction she’d been given.</p><p>As soon as Agatha stepped through the door, a tiny body slammed into her legs. “Mom! You’re here!”</p><p>“Hey kid,” she said, picking Billy up with ease but pretending to struggle. “Whoa, you’re getting so big! What’s your mother been feeding you?”</p><p>“I like chocolate chip waffles,” he replied with such sincerity that Agatha had no choice but to drop the act.</p><p>“Me too. With a little bit of peanut butter.”</p><p>“Me too!” Billy cried out. “But Tommy’s allergic now so we get a special kind.”</p><p>“Sunflower butter,” a groggy Tommy answered from the bed. He had been sleeping, clearly awoken by his twin brother’s enthusiasm, and had a bright blue cast on his left arm.</p><p>“It’s not as good as the real stuff,” Billy whispered loudly, causing the only other occupant in the room, the one Agatha had been ignoring, to chime in.</p><p>“Hey,” Wanda complained playfully. “You told me you liked it.”</p><p>“It’s <i>fine</i>, Mommy, but I wish it were better.”</p><p>“Wanda,” Agatha said, politely but dry, in greeting.</p><p>Wanda, apparently, did not have the same reservations she did. “Thank you for coming.” She stood, and tried to pull Agatha into a hug.</p><p>Instead, Agatha completely bypassed it, thankful the boys simply giggled at her antics, and moved over to Tommy’s good side. She extended her free hand and he took it with his good one, gently squeezing it before letting go.</p><p>There was a quick knock on the door before a doctor walked in. “I heard Thomas’s other mother made it.”</p><p>Agatha took <i>some</i> comfort in the way Wanda’s eyes lit up with a flash of anger. But, instead of the expected outburst, Wanda gritted her teeth and let out a hissed, “Yes.”</p><p>“I did,” Agatha solidified. The boys giggled again and Billy rested his head on her shoulder like he used to when he was a baby. Like how Nicky did nowadays.</p><p>Agatha ignored the pang of guilt and tuned into what the doctor had been saying. “-Seems to be doing well. No concussion, which is great. I think we’re going to have to keep him here for another hour or so while the discharge is being processed but after that you’ll be free to go.”</p><p>“Great,” Agatha sighed out as Wanda nodded in agreement across the room.</p><p>“So,” the doctor continued. She moved the clipboard in her hands back and forth between the two women. “Which one of you wants to sign him out?”</p><p>“I’ll take it,” Wanda replied, as if she wasn’t the only option. Agatha tried to pretend she wasn’t seeing red.</p><p>“Sure.” The doctor smiled gently, passing the forms along.</p><p>Wanda looked back at the doctor for a beat too long, before adding “I actually had another question, I wanted to ask privately.”</p><p>The doctor’s brow furrowed but she nodded. “Alright, sure.”</p><p>The two stepped into the hallway, Wanda without a look back, and Agatha turned back to the boys. They had dark circles under their eyes, a clear sign that they’d been up all night. “You know,” she began, placing Billy down so she could look at the two of them simultaneously. “Your mom told me what happened.”</p><p>Suddenly, Billy and Tommy started talking over one another, trying to tell their version of the story.</p><p>“We didn’t do it on purpose, swear-“</p><p>“-And mommy had said we could go outside to watch fireworks-“</p><p>“-Had done it before! In the daytime! I didn’t-“</p><p>“-Wrong angle from the tree! So he hit the ground instead of the trampoline-“</p><p>“-Fine until I got up. And then it hurt.”</p><p>Agatha let them finish, the two of them slightly out of breath. She nodded sharply once. “I understand. But, you really freaked your mom out. You really freaked <i>me</i> out. You guys know better than that. And the fact that you’re trying to reason with me, tells me you <i>know</i> that, and that you knew you could hurt yourself by doing what you did.”</p><p>They looked remorseful, heads slightly down. “We’re sorry,” Tommy said.</p><p>“Yeah,” Billy echoed. “We’re sorry.”</p><p>“I accept your apology,” Agatha replied. “And, you should apologize to mommy too.”</p><p>They nodded in agreement before Billy added, “Can I be sorry and not sorry?”</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrowed in confusion. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“Like, I’m sorry I told Tommy jumping from the tree onto the trampoline would be fun” Billy began, with a thinking expression on his face Agatha had seen countless times on Wanda. “But I’m also not sorry, because it means you came to visit us when Tommy’s arm got broken.”</p><p>Agatha mulled the question over. A part of her was proud of his thought process. Tommy chimed in. “I have the same question. I’m sorry, but I’m happy you’re here. You’re the fun mom.”</p><p>“You can be both,” Agatha assured them. “Although don’t let your mommy think I’m more fun than her.”</p><p>“But you are,” Tommy whined back.</p><p>Wanda walked in, looking slightly more peeved than before. “Your dad still hasn’t found a flight that gets in sooner guys, sorry.”</p><p>“Where is he this time?” Agatha questioned.</p><p>“London,” Billy supplied quickly. “He’s got work.”</p><p>“Around the holidays?”</p><p>Wanda sighed out sharply. “Special conference. You know how it is,” she replied, which Agatha knew was shorthand for <i>I’ll tell you later, but not in front of the kids.</i></p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but took the other chair in the room, pulling Billy into her lap, and began asking them questions about second grade and their soccer tryouts and what they’d gotten for Christmas.</p><p>They chatted easily, Wanda chiming in once or twice, but mostly just letting Agatha talk with them, which Agatha appreciated. She usually only saw them once a year for a week or two in the summer. It was the most Wanda had been willing to agree to and Agatha was desperate for even a single second with the twins.</p><p>Around noon, they were finally free to leave. Wanda loaded the kids up in her minivan with a promise of chicken nuggets and Agatha trailing them home.</p><p>“You okay?” Wanda asked as she got into the driver’s seat.</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “I wanted to ask you that.”</p><p>“Talk tonight?”</p><p>Agatha nodded and walked over to the small Prius she’d rented. She checked her phone but had no new messages or calls.</p><p>As she pulled out of the parking lot, she heard the phone ring and quickly answered without looking at the caller ID. “Rio?”</p><p>“Agatha,” Jen sighed out on the other side. “Where are you?”</p><p>“Um, I’m in L.A.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>“Yeah. <i>Oh</i>.”</p><p>“Are the kids okay? Are you okay?”</p><p>“Everyone’s fine,” Agatha replied, taking the same left turn Wanda’s van just had. “Tommy broke his arm last night and Wanda freaked out and…I’m not sure what I’m doing here. I think I just panicked too.”</p><p>There was a beat before Jen filled in the silence. “You’re only human. Wanda has a way of…catastrophizing everything. And you love your kids, of course you’d be worried.”</p><p>Agatha felt that just as she thought she was done crying for the day, the prickling sensation of tears returned. “Jen,” she began, voice cracking. “Is Rio…did Rio…is she…”</p><p>“She called Alice this morning. <i>Early</i> this morning,” Jen added, voice tired. “I think she was hoping to catch her off guard and get some answers.”</p><p>“Shit. What did she say?”</p><p>There was some shuffling on the side and Jen saying something along the lines of, “I’m not playing this game of telephone,” before Agatha assumed she was placed on speakerphone and Alice’s voice chimed in.</p><p>“She was really hurt, Agatha. At all of us. I tried telling her that <i>you</i> told <i>us</i> not to say something until you spoke with her over the holiday’s but-”</p><p>“I chickened out,” Agatha replied, voice thick. Wanda had finally entered a neighborhood Agatha recognized from her previous visits, and Agatha felt like she was running out of time again. “Alice,” she whispered.</p><p>“Yeah?” the voice on the other side asked. Alice sounded almost as defeated as Agatha felt.</p><p>“Be honest. Do you think I can fix this?”</p><p>“Maybe,” Alice replied.</p><p>Jen oh-so helpfully added, “If you can get your head out of your ass.”</p><p>“She was mad,” Alice continued cautiously, “but I think she was more confused. Like she couldn’t understand why you wouldn’t tell her after all this time.”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha replied gently, pulling up to the curb on the house Wanda had parked at.</p><p>“I could tell she still cares about you. She asked about where you’d gone and if you were safe.”</p><p>The twins ran off into the house, but Wanda stared at her for a second before following them in. “I’m sorry I dragged you guys into this.”</p><p>She was sure Jen rolled her eyes as she responded. “We’re your friends. We’re here for you, even when you do dumb stuff like not telling the woman you’re in love with about your life.”</p><p>“I-“</p><p>“We’re Rio’s friends too, now,” Alice added. “Or, we’d like to be.”</p><p>“I’ll let her know…if she ever talks to me again.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Jen said just before Agatha hung up. “Tell her the truth. The <i>whole</i> truth.”</p><p>“Thanks, guys.”</p><p>She got out of the car and entered the house. Billy came running up to her with Tommy close behind, some type of controller in their hands. “Mom, you <i>have</i> to play Mario Kart with us. I want to see if I can play one-handed.”</p><p>“Yeah!” Billy echoed.</p><p>“Boys,” Wanda shouted from the kitchen. “Why don’t we let Agatha take a little break? She’ll go up to play with you guys later.”</p><p>Agatha hated seeing their faces drop, so she agreed and followed them into the den upstairs. After what felt like a thousand rounds, which the boys insisted was only three, Tommy got tired of losing due to being mostly one-handed, so Agatha convinced them to play a slower paced game.</p><p>“But then you won’t get to play with us,” Billy replied.</p><p>“I think your mom was right,” Agatha said, ignoring how sore her back felt after an hour of sitting on a bean bag chair. “I just need to take a little break.”</p><p>She placed a kiss on the tops of both of their heads and headed back down, where she found Wanda sitting at her kitchen counter, furiously typing on her computer. “Nuggets are almost ready,” she said.</p><p>“We need to talk.”</p><p>Wanda looked up mid-keystroke. “Can we talk tonight?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “I have to talk to someone else tonight. Hopefully.”</p><p>“Oh, avoidant Agatha’s actually going to confront something?” Agatha took a sharp inhale ready to argue, but deflated, immediately confused, when Wanda quickly added. “Sorry, sorry, that was a cheap shot. I shouldn’t have said that.”</p><p>A freely given <i>apology</i> was certainly something new from her. Agatha stared, brows knitted. “Are you…feeling okay? Did you hit your head or something?”</p><p>“Ha ha,” Wanda replied dryly. “I deserve that.”</p><p>When Wanda didn’t offer anything beyond those words, Agatha tried again. “Can you just tell me what’s going on? Why am I here instead of,” she lowered her voice, “your husband, famously the father of your children?”</p><p>“He’s visiting his family.”</p><p>“<i>You’re</i> his family.”</p><p>“His mother’s not well. And it was such a last minute trip after Christmas.”</p><p>“Wanda.”</p><p>“We’re…taking a little break,” Wanda finally broke. “Nothing serious. Just needed a change of pace.”</p><p>“He’s on another continent,” Agatha deadpanned.</p><p>“And he feels <i>really</i> bad about it.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, groaning in frustration. “I can’t- I can’t play these games anymore. Either you tell me what’s going on or I-“</p><p>“Vis wants another kid,” Wanda blurted out.</p><p>Instead of teasing her over Vision’s name, the way she normally would, Agatha froze. “He wants what?”</p><p>Wanda rounded the counter to stand in front of Agatha. “I know. That's why I wanted to talk with you after the twins went to bed.”</p><p>“You’re not seriously considering-“</p><p>“No,” Wanda replied quickly. “Or at least, I’m not. That’s why we’re taking a break. I told him it was too much last time, especially since he wasn’t around for most of it. But he argued that he’d changed, which is true, he’s not a bad dad. So I told him I’d have to talk with you about it and <i>that</i> made him upset.”</p><p>“God forbid you speak to the person who you <i>actually</i> raised kids with before you ripped them away.”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“So you decided to call <i>me instead of him</i> when Tommy broke his arm?” Agatha replied in disbelief.</p><p>“I called him first,” Wanda replied, looking down at the floor. “He was on the phone when I was speeding to the hospital. But the first flight he could find was- is, in two days. I called you about an hour later…after when I was, well, you heard me.”</p><p>“Freaking out,” Agatha finished for her.</p><p>“I knew you’d get here faster,” Wanda reasoned. “And I know you’d do anything for my…our…the kids.”</p><p>“Why is that so hard for you to admit?” Agatha was picking over a scab in an argument she’d had a million and one times. An argument she’d never fully understood the other side of. “That they’re my kids too?”</p><p>The oven’s timer beeped and Wanda moved to take the metal tray out. “I’m getting there,” she replied with a watery laugh. Agatha opened her mouth, but as if she knew what she was about to do, Wanda raised a hand, effectively stopping her. “Don’t call them down yet, this is important.”</p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure if now <i>she</i> was the one who’d hit her head on something. “Okay,” she replied slowly.</p><p>“This whole,” she gestured something with her hands before turning away “conversation and, everything, made me realize how, um, important you were- <i>are</i> to us. How you…you did raise them with me, Agatha. Vision was upset because I told him that, <i>if</i> we had another child, which, again, I don’t want to, I’d want them to have the same agreement we have between us and you and the twins. And that regardless of that other kid, I’d, um, had been wanting to expand that agreement for a while now. I…I realized how much they miss you.” Wanda pulled plates from cabinets and started setting their lunches up.</p><p>Agatha finally managed to swallow the lump in her throat. “That is…not what I was expecting. At all.”</p><p>“I know.” Wanda looked like she wanted to reach out and touch Agatha, offering comfort in some way, but she held herself back. “The guest room is made up, upstairs, by the way. In case you want to get your bags out of the car. You’re welcome to stay here for as long as you’d like.”</p><p>“Vision gets here Sunday?”</p><p>“Yes. And he <i>knows</i> you’re here.” Agatha gave her a look, so she added. “I can change too.”</p><p>“Yeah, you’re right, sorry.”</p><p>“It’s a lot,” Wanda echoed herself. “But we’re all trying. And, I can’t speak for you, but I know Vis and I want to work this all out.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, wanting to commit but still feeling residual anxiety from the fight that never came. “Fine.”</p><p>“Okay,” Wanda acquiesced, before taking Agatha’s line. “Boys! Lunch is ready!”</p><p>After lunch they decided it was warm enough to go for a walk around the neighborhood. Agatha listened as the boys pointed out where Tommy beat Billy in a race last week or which neighborhood kid had the better snacks at school.</p><p>At one point, Billy looked up at her. “How come you’re here now?”</p><p>“Because Tommy broke his arm and I wanted to see him.”</p><p>“But you always come in the summer,” Billy added. Tommy nodded along.</p><p>“I…decided to switch it up.”</p><p>“Does that mean we won’t see you this summer?”</p><p>Before Agatha could answer, Wanda chimed in. “Would you boys want to spend more time with Agatha?”</p><p>They nodded their heads furiously. “She’s cool,” Tommy added.</p><p>Agatha snorted. “I’ll make sure to remind you when you’re a teen and want to get rid of me.”</p><p>Tommy stopped in his tracks before launching himself at her waist. “I’ll never want to get rid of you.”</p><p>Billy mirrored his twin on the other side of her body. “Yeah.”</p><p>Agatha held them close and Wanda raised her phone. “Wait, I’m gonna take a picture. You guys look so cute!”</p><p>They smiled, before continuing on their way.</p><p>“More time, huh?” Agatha murmured when the boys were out of earshot.</p><p>“I told you. I’m serious about making it work.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha replied, before waiting a beat. “Is one of you guys dying?”</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes. “No one is dying, Agatha. Vis and I just started a big conversation and I…wanted to keep the ball rolling. Life was getting a little stale.”</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “It’s better than your other coping mechanisms.”</p><p>Wanda grumbled but agreed.</p><p>They got back to the house and the twins argued about which movie to watch until Agatha broke it up, saying there was enough time for a movie marathon. Despite these words, the three of them promptly fell asleep 30 minutes into some type of singing animated movie. Agatha couldn’t even remember which one she’d hit play on, considering how tired she’d been.</p><p>Wanda woke them up from their naps and let them know she’d ordered pizza, since it had been a long day and she didn’t feel like cooking, so Agatha volunteered to go get it. The other three cheered and she felt a sense that she’d lived a version of this day before, where she had a wife and kids who got excited for her over the smallest things.</p><p>Her vision morphed into one of a small baby and a brown-eyed brunette as Agatha put her shoes on.  She stared at her phone, willing for a call to magically come through or texts to appear, but it had been radio silence from Rio since midnight. Agatha had sent a few more messages throughout the day, not wanting to push Rio but <i>also</i> not wanting Rio to think she didn’t care about her.</p><p>She was starting to doubt what Alice and Jen had said earlier that morning.</p><p>When she returned, when the pizza was cleared, and when, only when, Wanda and the twins said good night and left her in her room, did she let the tears fall freely. Agatha was overwhelmed. She showered again, hoping it would somehow help, as if she could wash thoughts down the drain.</p><p>It was barely 9 pm when her head hit the pillow. Curled into herself, lights off and hands tight against the soft blanket covering her body, she shut her eyes and tried to think of something that wasn’t Rio and Nicky, when her phone began to buzz from where it was charging on the nightstand.</p><p>Agatha snatched it up quickly and tensed at the sight of the name and contact picture. She answered the call and let out a quiet, “Rio.”</p><p>There was silence and then a shuddering breath. “Hi.”</p><p>“Hi,” Agatha echoed. “Um, thanks for calling me.”</p><p>“Yeah. I, um, couldn’t sleep.” Rio was quiet for another moment. “I got your texts.”</p><p>“I wrote full sentences this time.” Agatha swallowed the big angry monster trying to keep her away from sincerity. “But, that’s not important,” she rushed out. “What I wanted to say is that I’m…I’m <i>so</i> sorry, Rio.”</p><p>Rio let out an annoyed huff of air. “The thing is, I’m not even sure what you’re apologizing <i>for</i>, Agatha.”</p><p>“I know, and that’s on-“</p><p>“Do you know how I’ve felt,” Rio interrupted, “this whole day, thinking about how stupid I must have looked to you? To my <i>friends</i>? For <i>months</i>?”</p><p>“I’m sorry. And that’s not their fault, I told them not to tell you.”</p><p>“Yeah, seems that worked out well for <i>you</i>,” Rio snided. “You’re the nosy neighbor helping the clueless new parent all while having a family of your own. I’m sure you were having a lot of fun just dragging us along until they called last night.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha replied firmly. “I swear that is not what I was doing.”</p><p>“Then tell me the truth,” Rio demanded.</p><p>“I- I- I want to,” Agatha stuttered out. “It’s just complicated.”</p><p>“Then uncomplicate it for me.” Rio was clearly pissed. “I’m not dumb, Agatha, despite whatever it is you’ve told yourself.”</p><p>Agatha groaned. She’d thought this conversation out forwards and backwards all day and now, it was all coming out wrong. “Rio, please, believe me when I say I want to be honest with you. I want to tell you everything I just…I’m scared of what you’ll think of me.”</p><p>“It can’t possibly be worse than what I’m thinking right now, Agatha.”</p><p>“I have two boys. Twins,” she said, trying to reign her frustration back in. “I’m…They call me mom. Because I <i>am</i> their mom. But I’m not their <i>real</i> mother. Not in a biological or…legal sense of the word.”</p><p>There was a sharp inhale, and then Agatha heard her phone chime that she was getting a FaceTime. She answered it to find Rio, in her pajamas against a lot of pillows, staring at her. Agatha sat up and turned on the lamp on the nightstand.</p><p>“I want to see you,” Rio said in greeting. “I don’t want you dropping off the face of the earth.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but smirk at that. “I haven’t dropped off, I’m just in California.”</p><p>“Right,” Rio grumbled. “Continue.”</p><p>“My ex-wife,” Agatha said, and saw Rio’s eyes grow wide. “She…she…we met in grad school. She was studying chemistry and I was trying to figure out exactly what in history I wanted to specialize in. We got along like a house on fire and made the very youthful, very dumb mistake of eloping, like, the day after graduation.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio replied quietly.</p><p>“I think around that time is when the cheating started too. I was away a lot on conferences or site visits, still in school to get my doctorate and she,” Agatha sighed, “she…said she got lonely. We were divorced by the time we were 30.”</p><p>“That still doesn’t-“</p><p>“The twins are seven right now.” She saw Rio try to hide her surprise when she did the mental math and came to the conclusion that Agatha had children with an ex, five years after they’d divorced. “Trust me, I’m trying to get there.”</p><p>Rio pursed her lips. “Like you trusted me?”</p><p>“Please, Rio,” she begged. “I’ll tell you everything and then…and then you’ll never have to see my face again.”</p><p>Before Rio could answer, there was a knock on Agatha’s bedroom door. It was clear Rio heard it too from the way she leaned in closer to the phone.</p><p>“Who’s there?” she called out softly. The door creaked and Billy’s head popped in. “What’s up, hon?”</p><p>“Can I sleep in here tonight? With you?”</p><p>“What’s wrong with your bed?”</p><p>“Had a nightmare,” he said, already ambling up to the side of the bed that was empty. “And Tommy snores so I can’t fall back asleep.”</p><p>Agatha glanced down at the screen, worried, before nodding. “You’re going to have to give me a minute before I turn off the light. I’m talking to a friend.”</p><p>“Okay, mom,” he replied, snuggling up against Agatha’s waist.</p><p>“That’s…” Rio started.</p><p>“Billy,” Agatha completed for her.</p><p>“Right.” Rio twisted on her side, looking at something over her phone, before glancing back at Agatha. “When do you come back?”</p><p>“Tuesday.” Agatha felt like she was tripping over herself. “We could…keep talking like this on Wednesday.”</p><p>Rio sighed. “To be honest, I really did just want to make sure you were okay.” Agatha nodded. “But I think I need some more time before...”</p><p>“Take all the time you need.”</p><p>“Okay.” Rio made a hmm sound. “Um, thanks.”</p><p>“Thank <i>you</i> for still, you know,” Agatha said, “talking to me.”</p><p>Rio nodded once. “Te veo.” And with that she hung up.</p>

<p>It had been two weeks.</p><p>Two weeks since Agatha had spoken to Rio. Two weeks since Wanda claimed to have turned a new leaf, which Agatha later found out was thanks to some type of mommy vlogger life coach she would have made fun of if it didn’t feel like she’d be kicking some type of gift horse in the mouth. And two weeks since Vision had made it back to his home.</p><p>Agatha never really knew where he stood with the man, outside of just general annoyance. Wanda, to her credit, led the charge and the three of them agreed to a new arrangement that would allow Agatha to <i>actually</i> have the twins visit <i>her</i> during their school breaks. They still needed to nail down the fine print but the knowledge that she’d see her kids more often carried her all the way back to her apartment.</p><p>Which is where she realized she was now truly, and deeply, alone.</p><p>Agatha had spent the last few days of her winter break holed up at home or in her office, figuring that the more she worked, the less time she’d have to think about Rio.</p><p>And Agatha was a grown woman. She understood Rio’s frustrations. But she also wanted to burst through Rio’s door, throw herself on her floor, and confess to every single indiscretion she’d ever made. She didn’t see why that was too much to ask for.</p><p>Her semester started off…fine. The new crop of students complained just as much as the past set. Billy and Eddie had finally gotten together, which somehow pissed Agatha off even more, knowing that these kids survived some type of mysterious, new dating ritual that she and Rio couldn’t get through. But, they at least gave Agatha a wide berth whenever researching together, just happy she had the money to pay them a bit more than the student the university usually granted her this semester.</p><p>She’d met up with Jen and Alice a handful of times, getting told she was meant to be more involved in planning a wedding that was <i>not</i> her own. They had mentioned Rio calling them again, just once, saying that she didn’t fault them but that she needed space away from them too.</p><p>Agatha had sent Lilia a message but all she’d gotten in return was a cryptic <i>Received.</i></p><p>So it was a surprise when she spotted the older woman walking into her building’s lobby. A long day led Agatha to order food delivery and she’d been doubled over checking her order was complete when someone cleared their throat beside her. “Lilia?”</p><p>“Darling,” Lilia replied with a coy smile. “Why are you dressed like that?”</p><p>Agatha had on her robe, fresh out the shower, long locks swept up into the microfiber towel atop her head, and fuzzy bunny slippers she’d never admit to even owning. “I live here.” She tilted her head up haughtily as if that was the end of the conversation.</p><p>“Are you looking to give a certain someone an eyeful?”</p><p>Agatha tightened her robe at the top with the hand not currently holding the bag with her pad thai and spring rolls. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>“Oh,” Lilia seemed to remind herself that she wasn’t just there to criticize Agatha’s apparel. “I’m here to pick up the bambino.”</p><p>“Babysitting?”</p><p>Lilia nodded. “He’s coming to mine for a couple of days.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened at that. “Rio’s got a date <i>that</i> good?”</p><p>Lilia scoffed gently and looked down, muttering something to herself before replying. “She’s sick. Some type of cold going around, I guess, and she doesn’t want Nicky to catch it.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>“You know,” Lilia began, “you could offer to help.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled sarcastically. “I doubt she wants that.”</p><p>“That was your first mistake.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Assuming what she wants.”</p><p>“Lilia,” Agatha began, with force and precision behind her words. “I do not want to fight with you, too.”</p><p>“Is that what you think is happening here? You’re fighting?”</p><p>“I don’t need you meddling.”</p><p>“I am helping someone who asked for help. Have you thought about doing that recently?”</p><p>Agatha was taken aback. “You don’t get to make those types of comments when-“</p><p>“I do when your actions affect me, Agatha.” Lilia’s voice was tight, holding her fury back. “I <i>do</i> get to tell you what a massive dolt you’re being when you hide something and place an already anxious person in a vulnerable position.”</p><p>“I didn’t-“</p><p>“I know you have your secrets,” she continued over her. “And I know you have your reasons. But this has gone on long enough. Not everyone is like your ex-wife.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips. “I know. I want to give her space. Which she did ask for, by the way.”</p><p>Lilia nodded once, slowly. “Then I think it would be a good olive branch to check on her. She’s…I think she misses you.”</p><p>“I can’t. I don’t want to do something just because she’s sick and ruin-“</p><p>“You deserve to live a life too, Agatha,” Lilia quickly interjected. “Just check in. See what she says.”</p><p>“I-“</p><p>“Here.” Lilia passed over a canvas bag. “I was going to drop these off when I picked Nicky up but why don’t you do it instead. Take your time getting into real clothes. I’ll be gone by the time you knock on her door.”</p><p>“But-“</p><p>“For crying out loud,” Lilia rolled her eyes. “It’s a polite gesture. You’re not asking to move in with her.”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip, worry etched on her face, before accepting she wasn’t going to win this one. “Fine. Fine.”</p><p>“Great,” Lilia replied with a smile. “Then lead the way.”</p><p>The two headed upstairs; Agatha to her respective apartment and Lilia to Rio’s. She couldn’t make anything out from the other side of the wall as she got dressed, rubbing oil and scrunching a bit of curl cream through her damp hair, but heard Rio’s door close at one point in time.</p><p>Agatha stared at her cooling dinner, sitting on her countertop, and groaned before grabbing the bag Lilia had left her and walking next door. She knocked lightly, hoping Rio wouldn’t hear her and she’d have to leave without having any type of conversation.</p><p>Of course, no such luck.</p><p>The door swung open to reveal a shivering Rio, dark bags under her eyes and a large blanket draped over her shoulders like a cape. Her hair was messy and her nose was bright red. “What are you doing here?” Rio asked. Although, with her congestion, it really came out more like <i>Wadderyoudoinhere</i>.</p><p>“Meds,” Agatha replied, lifting the bag up. “And a house call. Courtesy of Lilia.”</p><p>Rio gave her a confused glare. “Why wouldn’t she give these to me herself?”</p><p>“She loves to meddle.” Agatha glanced into the apartment beyond Rio, “and I think she knew you shouldn’t be left alone right now.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“Can I come in?” Agatha asked, already crossing the threshold.</p><p>“I can take care of myself.”</p><p>“You look like you’re a sneeze away from death,” Agatha retorted. Before Rio could respond, she started coughing heavily. “Okay, couch, now.”</p><p>Rio begrudgingly followed her instructions, laying down and cocooning herself until just her head was sticking out from under her blanket.</p><p>“Here’s what’s going to happen, you’re going to drink this,” Agatha said, rifling through the bag until she found the cough syrup, “and let me take your temperature. Then, I’m going to clean this place up because, no offense, but I think it’s been a handful of days since you’re done those dishes and vacuumed.”</p><p>Rio whined out in complaint. “I’m fine.”</p><p>Agatha sighed and knelt beside the couch. “I don’t want to start anything, Rio. Not while you’re like this. I just…I want to make sure you’re okay.”</p><p>Rio looked into her eyes for a second, a flicker of something more than just sickness, before a quiet, “Okay,” left her lips.</p><p>Agatha’s shoulders sagged in relief. “Okay, here,” she said, passing over the tiny cup of medicine she’d poured out.</p><p>Rio knocked it back, grimace on her face. “I prefer grape over the orange flavor.”</p><p>“I didn’t pick it out,” Agatha replied. She returned to the bag, failing to find what she was looking for. “You’ve got a thermometer?”</p><p>“Bedside table,” Rio croaked.</p><p>Agatha went into her bedroom, finding tissues strewn on the ground and wondering exactly how long Rio had been battling this cold before calling in reinforcements. She grabbed the tool and returned to the couch. “Open.”</p><p>Rio complied, placing the thermometer under her tongue. What she <i>hadn’t</i> expected was Agatha’s hand to come up and press gently against her forehead. She stared at her, blue eyes locking onto dark brown ones, everything and nothing being said.</p><p>When about a minute or so had gone by, her hand swept across Rio’s brow, down the side of her face, thumb pressing just under her lips. Rio let go without needing to be asked.</p><p>“You’re warm,” Agatha muttered, squinting as she lifted the thermometer up to her eyes. “Low grade fever. Nothing too concerning.”</p><p>Rio sighed, closing her eyes. “Okay.”</p><p>“Do you want to move to bed?”</p><p>Rio’s nose wrinkled. “I really am fine for now.”</p><p>“Alright, here.” Agatha passed her the TV remote that had been left on the floor at some point. “Put something stupid on and shout if you need anything.”</p><p>Agatha chose to tackle the kitchen first, her mental cleaning checklist listing the sink as the biggest biohazard in the apartment, apart from a generally sick Rio. She hummed to herself as she did the dishes, wiped the countertops, and organized the mail on Rio’s small kitchen table.</p><p>She did the bedroom next, moving methodologically throughout the space again. Sheets were replaced with fresh ones from the linen closet and trash was picked up. She would have liked to open a window and get some air in, but it was freezing out. Nicky’s room was the cleanest, so Agatha did a quick sweep over the space before closing the door.</p><p>Completing the chores helped Agatha’s mind. She forgot how good <i>she</i> could feel when she took care of someone she <i>actually</i> cared about. It helped that, although she’d do this for Rio any day and any time, which is something she’d only ever admit at gunpoint, helping her at this particular moment was a type of penance. Or at least, Agatha hoped it could be.</p><p>The living room was the only space left. She watered the plants, organized all of the toys strewn about the space, and yes, after Rio pointed to where it was, vacuumed the area.</p><p>Rio had been in and out throughout the evening. She refused any food Agatha tried to give her but did drink some water and some of Nicky’s pedialyte. Again, Agatha took the wins she could.</p><p>“Alright, let’s shower.”</p><p>“What?” Rio’s eyes snapped open. “We shouldn’t- we can’t-“</p><p>“Slow down, ba- Rio.” She blushed, hoping the other woman hadn’t caught the slip. “We’re not showering together. But you need to.”</p><p>“Are you saying I smell?”</p><p>Agatha gave her a look. “I’ll wait outside the door.”</p><p>“You don’t have to. You’ve done more than enough.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha replied easily. “But I want to.”</p><p>She helped Rio stand and the two, slowly but surely, made it to Rio’s en suite. Despite the permission, Agatha still felt a little awkward rifling through Rio’s drawers to grab a t-shirt and boxer shorts. She passed them along and sat on the corner of Rio’s bed as the door closed and she heard the taps turn on. Agatha checked her email on her phone, making a <i>slightly</i> rash decision before locking it.</p><p>Then, she took a look around the room. She hadn’t been in there before, apart from cleaning it about an hour ago. Rio seemed to have Agatha’s same hatred for her fluorescent ceiling light, as the only lights on had been twin bedside lamps and a small, glowing mushroom on her dresser. Her duvet was forest green and matched the dark floral sheets Agatha had put on. She smiled when she realized Rio’s nightstand was home to three different baby books.</p><p>Across from her was the dresser. It was sparse, apart from a dish with a few rings, the small lamp, and a photo of Rio and Nicky. It must’ve been taken early on, maybe the same day she met him. She looked slightly awkward holding him, but the smile on her face was wide. Nicky was smaller but looked enamored with Rio, a gummy smile aimed up at her.</p><p>“‘M done,” a voice whispered and Agatha jumped, feeling as though she’d been caught doing something she shouldn’t have.</p><p>“How are you feeling?” Agatha pulled the covers back as Rio slipped into bed.</p><p>“Less like a semi ran me over,” Rio said, accepting that Agatha was going to tuck her in no matter what she said. “More like maybe a small sedan hit me.”</p><p>A quiet chuckle left Agatha’s lips. “Alright, let’s just try to make it through the night.” She bright the covers up to Rio’s chin. “Good?”</p><p>Rio looked at her. Her eyes were glassy, but Agatha had chalked it up to whatever illness had struck, nothing more. “I…”</p><p>“What?” Agatha whispered.</p><p>“Nothing,” Rio replied quickly. “It’s silly. And dumb.”</p><p>Agatha crouched beside her bed, coming face to face with Rio, who turned to lay on her side, just to look at her. “I bet it’s not.”</p><p>“It is,” Rio repeated. “I…I’m…”</p><p>“Tell me whatever it is you want to tell me.”</p><p>Rio shut her eyes tight. “Will you stay? Here? With me? Just until I fall asleep?”</p><p>Agatha let out a sharp breath. “Rio…I don’t know if that’s such a good idea. Not while you’re like this.”</p><p>“I don’t-“ Rio’s eyes snapped open. “I don’t mean like <i>that</i>. I just don’t want to be alone.”</p><p>Agatha thought it over, but she knew her resolve with Rio was shaky at best. “Fine. But just until you fall asleep.”</p><p>“Aye, aye, sir.”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“You can stay over the covers,” Rio responded. “No funny business.”</p><p>Which is exactly what Agatha did, laying on the unoccupied side of the bed, which was also her side of the bed at home. She didn’t want to think too much about that.</p><p>Rio shut the light next to her off and Agatha followed. The glow of the small mushroom, still on, sitting on the dresser created a candle light effect in the room.</p><p>“I cancelled my classes tomorrow,” Agatha volunteered. “Figured my students can have an early start to the weekend.”</p><p>“I didn’t-“</p><p>“I know,” Agatha quickly remedied. “I just wanted you to know. In case you needed help again.”</p><p>“Or this awful cold spreads.”</p><p>“That too.”</p><p>There was silence, and then Rio spoke again.“Can I ask you one more thing?” Her voice had grown soft, less nasally and lower since the shower. “It’s about…them.”</p><p>Agatha tensed up. “I told you I don’t want to tell you everything when you’re like this. I want to make sure you have a clear head.”</p><p>She heard the rustling of blankets and Rio turning again to look at her. “Not everything. Just one question.”</p><p>“Rio.” Agatha’s voice broke, but she too, turned onto her side.</p><p>They weren’t quite nose to nose, but their hands nearly met in the middle, centimeters away from each other. Rio was sure that if he’d pinkie twitched, it would hit Agatha’s. “Why’d you do it?”</p><p>Agatha inhaled. She looked away from Rio, down at her own hand, before steeling herself and glancing back up. “I…I didn’t want the dream to end. I liked being with you and Nicky and feeling like I was…part of something. Even if it was just the three of us. Especially when it was just the three of us. I love my boys and I miss them like crazy. But, when I was with you and Nicky…it’s not that I forgot who I was, it’s more that I realized there was a universe where I could have something like that again. I guess I just didn’t want that perfect universe to go away.”</p><p>Rio’s brow furrowed. “You feel like you don’t have that?”</p><p>“Not legally.”</p><p>“Oh.” She could see the wheels trying to turn in Rio’s mind. “Do you miss their other mom?”</p><p>That got Agatha to at least crack a small smile at the poorly disguised jealousy. “I told you there’s more to the story. But no, not really.”</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha began gently. “I’m not trying to be weird or cryptic, but I think you need to sleep.”</p><p>Rio nodded into her chin. “Yeah. But I want to know more about you.”</p><p>“And you will,” Agatha said. Her little finger twitched.</p><p>Rio intertwined it with hers. If Agatha asked about the blush on her cheeks, she’d blame her fever. “Okay. Fine.”</p><p>“Wow, not fighting me on it this time?”</p><p>“‘M tired,” Rio responded, closing her eyes. “And you’re right. I do want to feel better for this talk.”</p><p>“Good.” Agatha watched as Rio’s breath evened out, her own body feeling drowsy.</p><p>She figured closing her eyes for a few minutes couldn’t hurt.</p>

<p>Agatha awoke with what she assumed was her weighted blanket askew. It felt like it was only half covering her legs. And some type of…hair tickling her chin.</p><p>Her eyes snapped open and the top of Rio’s head barely came into view. It was clear Rio was knocked out cold, whatever cough medicine she’d given her the night before working its magic. Early morning light pressed through the blinds, the dimness telling Agatha it was just after dawn.</p><p>She tried to lift her chin, looking for an alarm clock, her phone, anything with an indication of what time it was. Instead, Rio whined and snuggled deeper into her.</p><p>Agatha was torn. She didn’t want to betray Rio’s trust or the tentative truce that had been offered last night. But, Rio clearly needed the sleep and Agatha had to admit she could easily drift off again.</p><p>“I can hear you thinking,” Rio’s muffled voice said, before she rolled off of her. “Sorry.”</p><p>“It’s fine,” Agatha replied quickly.”I didn’t mean to wake you up.”</p><p>Rio made a noncommittal hum as she snuggled into her own pillow, eyes blearily looking over. “‘S fine.”</p><p>Agatha waited, but Rio didn’t offer anything else. “Well, I’m going to go. Hope I don’t catch this cold.”</p><p>“You don’t have to-“</p><p>“I want to.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“Yup,” Agatha said before nearly throwing herself off the bed. She turned back to look at Rio just before she was headed out the door.</p><p>“Wait.”</p><p>Agatha turned and for a split second thought about getting back into bed, fully under the covers, and just holding a recovering Rio.</p><p>“Sunday,” Rio said, eyes now closed, seconds away from drifting back to sleep. “We can talk then.”</p><p>“We don’t have-“</p><p>“I have to get Nicky,” Rio replied. “We can get breakfast or something before I see Lilia. I’ll feel better I promise.”</p><p>Agatha tsked and returned to Rio’s side, pressing her hand on Rio’s forehead again. “Fine, if you don’t have a fever by tomorrow night, I’ll do Sunday.”</p><p>“Deal.”</p><p>Agatha returned home. She decided to gamble with the dinner that had been left on her countertop overnight and ate it cold. It counted as breakfast, even at five in the morning. Then, she put her pajamas on, and went to bed.</p><p>She woke up again closer to noon. There was coughing coming from Rio’s side of the wall, but it didn’t sound as bad as it had yesterday, and Agatha realized that Rio really did care; they’d <i>both</i> be counting down the hours</p><p>+++</p><p>Agatha made sure she was the first at the diner. She needed the jet fuel they served as coffee, having already downed her first cup without cream or sugar, leg bouncing underneath the table.</p><p>“Another, hon?” asked the overly-perky waitress. Agatha nodded, absentmindedly looking over the booth across from her for any sign of Rio.</p><p>The steam from her cup curled into her face until she finally spotted a familiar head of brown hair, rounding the corner on her way inside.</p><p>“Can I get you anything else?”</p><p>“Another coffee would be great, thanks,” Rio replied, popping down in the booth across Agatha’s, startling the waitress.</p><p>“Oh, sure, coming right up.” The smile she gave Agatha was even brighter than before.</p><p>“Hi, um,” Agatha began, “how are you?”</p><p>“Feeling much better,” Rio replied. And it was true, the color had returned to her cheeks and her hair was no longer a mess atop her head. Plus, she’d been able to wear real jeans to this and not just sweatpants.</p><p>“Good, that’s good,” Agatha replied with a sharp nod.</p><p>“Someone was there to nurse me back to health.”</p><p>“I did what anyone would’ve done.”</p><p>Rio’s brow furrowed gently and Agatha felt like the earth would swallow her whole any time now. “Most people wouldn’t, actually.”</p><p>“I just wanted you to be comfortable.”</p><p>“I see,” Rio replied. “And falling asleep on me had nothing to do with-“</p><p>“No! No. That was- No.”</p><p>Rio finally gave in, showing some mercy. “It was the best night’s sleep I’ve had in a while.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>There was a lull, both looking anywhere but the other person, before they tried to talk.</p><p>“So, I was wondering-“ “Do you want-“ they said one over the other.</p><p>“You go,” Agatha replied.</p><p>But Rio, blushing slightly, shook her head. “You can go.”</p><p>Agatha huffed out. “I was wondering if you wanted to see a picture of my kids. If that would help with the whole…everything.”</p><p>“Oh.” Rio’s eyes went wide with surprise. “Yeah, I’d like that.”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha mumbled, unlocking her phone and finding the last one Wanda took before Agatha had returned. In it Billy was on her left while Tommy was on her right. They were in their pajamas, Tommy’s blue cast probably visible from space, and the boys were clearly enthralled with whatever Agatha was saying, glasses on her nose and book in her lap. “It’s kinda blurry but-“</p><p>“No, it’s great,” Rio said, zooming into each person one by one. “I can tell that they love you.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha replied tightly. “That’s Billy and that’s Tommy.”</p><p>“Huh.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Kinda makes sense why you’re so maternal over your TA now.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “I am not.”</p><p>“You have a kid with the same name.”</p><p>“Purely coincidental.” Agatha paused. “Although I do have my suspicions that they’d get along.”</p><p>“Both nerdy?”</p><p>“God yea,” Agatha replied. “And…I don’t know. Call it a mother’s intuition, but I don’t think that kid is going to be 100% straight. He’s very…I want to protect how sensitive he is from the world.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “And the other one? Tommy?”</p><p>“He’s a nerd too. Maybe a bit more of a hell-raiser. Harder to read. He’s the one that broke his arm on new years trying to jump from a tree branch onto a trampoline but, clearly, he missed the landing. I was obviously worried but he was all smiles by the time I got to the hospital. Kid likes raising my blood pressure.”</p><p>Rio hummed in acknowledgement. “So…” she began.</p><p>“So,” Agatha echoed.</p><p>“I know bits and pieces, but I think I just want everything.”</p><p>“<i>Everything</i>?”</p><p>“Well, everything you want to tell me,” Rio said, followed by, “or everything you think I should know. I’m not…I don’t want to push <i>this</i> away anymore. And I don’t think you do either.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, slight frustration peeking through. “Do you have to be so understanding?”</p><p>“For most people? No,” Rio replied, shaking her head. “But for you?” She shrugged. “I’m tired of the miscommunication.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed the anxiety rushing up her tightening throat. “Alright.”</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said, hand skimming the tabletop as if she was going to reach for Agatha. “I’m not trying to judge you. I’m just trying to wrap my head around what happened.”</p><p>“Right.” Agatha nodded slowly.</p><p>So, she began to explain.</p><p>Agatha met Wanda when she was someone who felt…lost in life.</p><p>Agatha had just graduated with a bachelor’s degree, knew she had loved school but didn’t know what to do about it, and, most importantly, she had finally received the money her mother left when she died. Despite that woman trying to do everything she could for the sole purpose of ruining her only daughter’s life, the state now considered the money Agatha’s and not whatever homophobic cause her mother surely intended for it to go to. It wasn’t a large amount but it <i>did</i> mean that Agatha wasn’t depending on the shittiest jobs she could find for rent for a while. Somehow, <i>something</i> had worked out for her.</p><p>After a few visits to her professors’ office hours, she realized that her small liberal arts college needed research assistants in the history department. And that they thought she’d be a good fit for their accelerated doctoral program. She’d get a Master’s in a year and a half and would aim for a doctorate just shy of 30. She wouldn’t have to leave school, just as long as she made sure she’d get into the program. And Agatha Harkness wasn’t going to let some dimwit take her spot.</p><p><i>Lilia</i> had been right to handpick her amidst a small pool of students.</p><p>Rio’s eyes went wide but she said nothing.</p><p>“You know the next part,” Agatha continued, as she mentioned how Wanda and her got along like a house on fire.</p><p>They fell in love between library study sessions and coffee dates and one too many nights out at the only bar on campus. Agatha still remembers kissing her for the first time in a grimy club bathroom on a rare night out to Boston and thinking that she’d rather take the feeling of relief in finding someone that flooded her then, over the feeling of fireworks the movies spoke of.</p><p>Wanda was someone who had lost her family, and had been craving one ever since. Agatha, well, she’d never had much of a family to begin with, but having one sounded like something she had always wanted to try.</p><p>Then came their city hall elopement, where a few friends lost to time between then and now, agreed to be their witnesses. Notably absent was Lilia, who, as Agatha’s PhD supervisor, and closest mentor, told her she hadn’t seen this in the cards for Agatha.</p><p>Agatha had been hurt, sure, but what did some lonely, old lady know about <i>her</i> love life?</p><p>“Wanda cheated on me almost immediately. I learned there was someone on my side of the bed the first few times I went away to conferences as Lilia’s guest. It started a few months after we’d gotten married,” Agatha said, “and again when she started to go to her own things with her own advisors,” she added, now looking down at the table. “I…tried to cheat on her when I realized what was happening.”</p><p>Rio’s brow furrowed. “Tried to?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Some light flirting here, a makeout there. It never evolved into what she was… emotionally doing. I couldn’t take it.”</p><p>Their marriage slowed and eventually got to a grinding halt. Between their fights and the stress of Agatha finishing her dissertation and Wanda accepting a job halfway across the country after she’d finished her own degree, they were done. It took a while to finalize, but the divorce went through just as Agatha began teaching.</p><p>She was thirty, had a failed marriage under her belt, and a need to put everything into work. Agatha learned she had a real skill for writing proposals (begging people) into giving her grant money, and that money usually took her to wherever she wanted to be. She’d spend the school years in small town Massachusetts and used every break she could for travel. Agatha had gone across Europe, to learn of witch trials in Scotland and Spain and Germany. She’d gone to Peru a handful of times to learn about indigenous healers who had been killed for the same reasons. And she was able to connect these accusations against the ones made in Salem, much to the glee of the limited number of academics who knew of her work.</p><p>Nearly five years later, when she was poised to fly out again, this time to Indonesia, she got a call from a number she thought would never appear on her screen again.</p><p>“Wanda?” Rio filled in the blank just before their waitress returned to take their order.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t really eat when she was nervous, opting for some toast and a fruit bowl. Rio, however, either didn’t have the same issues or was making up for her lack of appetite during her illness by ordering something called The Lumberjack Special, with a million questions following it. Wheat. Scrambled. Two- No, three pancakes. Sausage and extra crispy bacon. Home fries were fine.</p><p>“Wanda,” Agatha sighed out in disdained agreement.</p><p>Her ex-wife was calling to ask if Agatha had seen that a new position had opened up in UCLA's history department, looking for someone with her skills and field of study. Oh, and that she needed someone to go to her 8-week checkup with her.</p><p>Rio’s brow furrowed. “The husband-“</p><p>“Was an assshole. Is still one, if I’m being honest. He’s…one of those guys that acts like a hippie and then you find out his grandfather was a lord or duke or someone who is definitely responsible for some atrocity that made his family a ton of money. Honestly it’s a miracle the twins won’t be raised the same way.”</p><p>“And they’re still married?” The shock was evident in Rio’s tone.</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “Haven’t gotten there yet but, yeah. Wanda insists that he’s changed and is a good dad or whatever, but I try not to talk to him too much.”</p><p>“Fair enough,” Rio replied.</p><p>Agatha leaned forwards, playing with the paper napkin on the table. She mentioned flying out to LA for the very first time, worried, because despite how things ended with Wanda, there was still a part of her that felt connected to her. She was someone who understood a part of Agatha’s life no one but Lilia would ever witness. Looking back, it didn’t take a lot for her to stay.</p><p>Wanda needed help and she begged for <i>Agatha</i> of all people to stay with her.</p><p>“It was my biggest mistake,” Agatha said, slowly and calculated. “But brought some of my happiest memories and my favorite people into my life.”</p><p>Rio gulped just as the waitress began to set the plates down. It was quiet, neither really digging in now. “So…”</p><p>“So,” Agatha explained. “I…interviewed at UCLA and they liked me enough. And…I felt like I’d somehow gotten a wife again. And kids.”</p><p>There was never any formal reunion. No marriage certificate resigned or divorce filings torn up. Agatha quietly resigned from her work on one coast and began at the other, much to Lilia’s chagrin. But they both agreed she needed a change of pace. She rented out an apartment for the grand total of two months before Wanda called her, uncomfortable as hell, in the middle of the night saying that if Agatha didn’t come home with a Taco Bell nacho cheese and a gas station hot dog she’d bite her head off.</p><p>Agatha chose to move in the next day. It took a grand total of just one more week before they’d ignited what was left of their romantic relationship.</p><p>“I thought okay, you know, we hit some type of midlife crisis early,” Agatha said, watching as Rio began digging in. Her chest warmed as she realized Rio was trying to look at her while eating, and failing to get any real food on her fork. “And I dunno, maybe, selfishly, I liked that she needed me.”</p><p>Agatha was there throughout the entire pregnancy, through twelve hours of labor, through both boys coming into the world. It didn’t matter that her name wasn’t on the birth certificate, she was their mother. Agatha still remembers, clear as day, driving them all home from the hospital, the twins on either side in the back while Wanda sat in the middle, looking at them in awe and murmuring sweet words every time one of them shifted.</p><p>They rented out a small condo with a yard at that point. Agatha thought about how it only took her seven long strides to get from her and Wanda’s bedroom, to where the twins slept. She’d learned a lot by doing, and more so by just watching her two boys interact with each other. Wanda was always the nervous and careful parent, so Agatha felt like she had more freedom.</p><p>Three blissful years passed by. Agatha was there for it all, raising her twin boys alongside Wanda.</p><p>Which is why it felt like ice in her veins when, on a random Sunday morning, when Wanda was busy with the boys’ breakfasts, Agatha decided to pick up her partner’s ringing phone with the caller ID <i>Work V</i>, and hear an English man’s voice say, “Hello darling, how are the boys?”</p><p>“Oh, Agatha,” Rio gently whispered. Her big, brown eyes shone with pity and Agatha felt another wave of anxiety coarse through her.</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Turns out, he had…a change of heart a few months after the boys were born. They’d been sending pictures and texts and calling each other when I was asleep or thinking I was doing the right thing by taking them out to the park, giving Wanda a break. For years. She didn’t think I’d find out because I’d been so focused on <i>our sons</i>.”</p><p>“That’s awful.”</p><p>“Separating was worse that time around. I…felt like I changed my whole life for her and she couldn’t...”</p><p>Rio waited for a beat. “That’s…a lot.”</p><p>Agatha let out a watery snort. “Gets worse. I flew out to Lilia, basically collapsed on her doorstep, then tried to go back for the kids. Wanda wouldn’t do that, saying Vision was their real dad and I wasn’t a part of their family. Flipped on me so fast I had to hire a lawyer and <i>then</i> Wanda claimed I abandoned the three of them. I was trying to sue my own family so I could at least see my sons. That’s the part I hated the most,” she finished, whispering ashenly.</p><p>Rio sat back in the booth. “That’s why you freaked out at the park. That lady thought you were with us but-“</p><p>“I know I…I want to be a part of…whatever I can get from you and Nicky. But I’ve been kicked out of my family before.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t-“</p><p>“That’s what everyone says,” Agatha replied, sounding defeated. “And then you’re sitting in a windowless room, agreeing to see your kids for two, <i>maybe</i> three weeks of their summer vacation every year, because it’s all you think you’ll ever get.”</p><p>“Fuck.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Their waitress came by to clear their plates and ask if they wanted anything else, but they both waved her off. “I’ll get more time with them soon, though. Wanda’s been on a mommy blogger guru kick and her and Vision are…having their differences. And, I got word that the court approved the change for the custody agreement, so they can’t really take it back now.”</p><p>“That’s great.” Rio offered a small but genuine smile.</p><p>Agatha leaned over her half of the table. “I am <i>so</i> sorry I didn’t tell you. I wanted to, I swear. I was just…”</p><p>“You’ve gone through a lot.”</p><p>“That’s not an excuse.”</p><p>“But you <i>have</i>.”</p><p>“Whatever. I’m still sorry for…for not telling you about them. I should’ve since like the second time I helped Nicky. And…sorry for leading you and Nicky along. Like I said, it was so <i>good</i>, I just wanted to take whatever I could get.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said gently. “That boy isn’t yours.”</p><p>She huffed, looking down at her empty coffee mug before glancing back up. “I…I know.”</p><p>“I don’t say that to be mean but…a secret family.“</p><p>“I wanted more time. With both of you,” Agatha added.</p><p>Rio looked down at that. “You…I…You could’ve had more. I would’ve given you more.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes closed, in a feeble attempt to stop her tears from springing. “Don’t.”</p><p>“There’s a part of me that wants to let you back in,” Rio began, causing Agatha’s eyes to snap wide open, mouth agape, and just staring across the table. “I won’t lie to you. Despite, <i>everything</i> I…I like you. I don’t think you’re a bad person. But,” she continued on, toying with her fingers, “there’s another part of me that <i>does</i> feel betrayed. You, well, you didn’t exactly lie, but you also weren’t truthful. You hid a part of yourself from me. Hid things that, yes are yours, but…I feel like there’s nothing stopping you from doing it again.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “I swear, those are the only skeletons in my closet.”</p><p>Rio gave a half-huff as her tongue poked against the inside of her cheek. “I have a lot in mine.”</p><p>It took Agatha a second and then she groaned. “Really? A dad joke right now?”</p><p>Rio shrugged, chuckling as the two let some levity pass between them. “I don’t get to make a lot of jokes as a mortician.”</p><p>“I’m serious though,” Agatha replied. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>Rio sighed. “I know. I think…maybe, could we start again?”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha whispered. “Clean slate.”</p><p>“Though, to be honest, I want to move slowly and clearly.”</p><p>“Whatever you need.”</p><p>“No more of the talking or whatever. I need to understand what we’re doing.”</p><p>“I get it. It was honestly confusing for me too,” Agatha grumbled.</p><p>Rio shook her head. “This has to be mutual. I want to know <i>you</i> and your kids as much as you want to know mine. I want you to be someone I can rely on, without fear that you’re going to drop another bomb on me.”</p><p>“Like I said, that’s really the big one.”</p><p>“Well that,” Rio said, “and Lilia.”</p><p>“She’d never-“</p><p>“She didn’t tell me anything,” Rio replied, following Agatha’s train of thought. “But she did saythat you’d have a rough go at it. Admittedly, I was a <i>bit</i> more lenient with her than Jen and Alice, but there was something about her I knew I could trust.”</p><p>“I know the feeling,” Agatha acquiesced.</p><p>“I didn’t realize she’d known you for so long.”</p><p>Agatha inhaled sharply. “One trauma at a time, yeah? I promise that’s not as bad. But maybe I need time before you fully diagnose me.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, but her smirk gave her away. “I’m not trying to psychoanalyze you.”</p><p>“Could’ve fooled me,” Agatha replied, with no real bite in her words.</p><p>Their waitress came up to the booth once more, asking if they needed anything else, before wordlessly dropping the check on the middle of the table, and a final smile at the two.</p><p>“I got it,” Agatha said.</p><p>“Let’s split it.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “Let me, please. I’m the one responsible for all of this.”</p><p>Agatha paid up front before they headed out.</p><p>“So,” Rio began.</p><p>“So,” Agatha echoed, feeling lighter now that she had confessed.</p><p>“I’ll…I’ll see you around?”</p><p>“Yeah, yes,” Agatha replied.</p><p>Rio gave her a look before leaning into her space, slowly as if not to spook her, and pressing a kiss against her cheek, hand warm against Agatha’s side. “Te veo,” she whispered.</p><p>Agatha felt like she spent an hour stuck to that exact sidewalk corner, thinking about the feeling that maybe, <i>maybe</i> she could have something good in her life again.</p><p>+++</p><p>Agatha saw Nicky and Rio a few days latter, the former toddling after the latter. She gasped, which was enough to have a small baby running towards her at his full speed.</p><p>She swung him up into her arms, much to his delight. “Thanks,” Rio said, a few steps behind and slightly out of breath. “He’s been pulling the escape artist card all afternoon.”</p><p>“Well, I think that calls for going to the park.”</p><p>“Unfortunately,I think the park is too cold right now,” Rio countered. “Especially with the amount of layers we have to put on before naptime.”</p><p>“Got it.” Agatha swayed as Nicky grew fussy again. “Well, I’ll see you around?”</p><p>Rio nodded, taking Nicky from Agatha's hands. “Yeah, of course.”</p><p>“I um, was thinking about you,” Agatha clumsily got out.</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Yeah,” she replied. “There’s a botanical garden on campus. I saw a flyer for a new exhibit with butterflies. It starts in a couple of weeks.”</p><p>“Oh, cool.”</p><p>“Would you maybe want to go? Might be fun to see the butterflies, um, hatch and all of that. It could be you and me and Nicky?”</p><p>“Like on a date?” Rio blushed.</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha looked down at Nicky and back at Rio. “I think it sounds fun. And you like plants.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio said, sighing in relief at how Agatha <i>had</i> listened to her. “It’s a date.”</p>
