<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>Her ex had made out like a bandit in the divorce. She’d gotten the condo, the car, their friends, and eight thousand bucks a month in alimony for the next eight years. Emotional neglect it had decided as. Irreconcilable differences. </span>
</p><p>
<span>That was the part that had gotten under Agatha’s skin. They’d been together for fifteen years, married for ten of it. And during that time she’d clawed her way to the top of the partnership ladder at the firm. For a decade she’d worked early, late, weekends, and holidays. All in support of her wife whose primary contribution to their finances was a small (yet surprisingly profitable) Etsy shop.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hadn’t minded that though. She enjoyed being a provider and breadwinner. When she fell in love with her ex it was because of her free spirit. But it turns out her wife would have preferred someone who was a little less successful, a little less ambitious, a little less </span>
<em>
<span>hungry</span>
</em>
<span>. Someone who was around more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The one term Agatha hadn’t been willing to budge on was keeping </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span> house. She’d owned it outright before the divorce, and though the condo was more valuable, this one was hers. Plus it had a pool.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After the divorce was finalized, the other partners had insisted she take a few weeks, and as she was currently between cases, she’d agreed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So she set herself to refamiliarizing herself with the house that she had bought but had had little hand in decorating or tending to. She had realized this morning while fiddling with the expensive espresso machine her wife一</span>
<em>
<span>her money</span>
</em>
<span>一had bought that she was a stranger in this place. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was beautifully decorated but with the pictures gone and the last of her ex-wife’s boxes out, Agatha noticed how little of herself there was in this place. She shook off the feeling and donned a flowing robe before making her way out to lounge by the pool.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It had been an extravagance when she’d bought it, one that she hadn’t ended up using as much as she’d thought. A few times a year her ex would convince her to invite their friends round to make a day of it. But these days the only person in it was the pool guy or whatever who dropped by a few times a week. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She thought it was once a week. She wasn’t sure. Her wife had maintained the schedule of cleaners, landscapers, and other workers who had shuttled in and out of the house. Agatha had never interacted with any of them. She just paid the bill.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The last thing her ex had given her was a little notebook with all the details of the household details and routines she kept written down. It had been meant as a gift. Agatha took it as one last dig. As if she, a prestigious and renowned attorney with a perpetually full client list, couldn’t manage a house alone. </span>
<em>
<span>Her</span>
</em>
<span> house.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had no problem being alone. In fact, at this point in her life, 48 years old and starting over, she </span>
<em>
<span>welcomed</span>
</em>
<span> it. In that spirit, she removed her robe and dropped it carelessly to the side before laying down on her stomach. She hadn’t bothered with anything under the robe. The well-manicured hedge was tall blocking out any prying eyes, and the feel of the sun against her skin was too good to pass up. The warmth washed over her and before long she drifted off into a nap. </span>
</p><p>
<span>One that was far too brief and incredibly rudely interrupted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey lady, not that it’s my business, but you should probably flip before you burn.” A cool voice broke her solace. Agatha startled at the sound and scrambled to sit up, grabbing the robe and pulling it like a sheet to cover her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>At the far end of the pool stood a young woman balancing a long pole and a large net on her shoulders. She was in a tank top and black shorts, shorts Agatha couldn’t help but notice that seemed to expose miles of tan leg. A faded blue cap covered her hair drawn up into a tight ponytail, and dark sunglasses covered her eyes. Eyes that were likely crinkled based on the wide smirk on her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s cheeks flushed, partly from embarrassment but mostly from irritation. The audacity. It was her pool, and she didn’t need unsolicited skincare advice from some… cheeky, young, </span>
<em>
<span>far-too-young</span>
</em>
<span> her brain filled in, pool girl.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Clearing her throat, Agatha pulled her robe properly around herself and shot the girl a frosty look. “I’m fine, thank you. You're right, it's not your business. And it's Agatha, not lady.” she replied, trying to channel her best courtroom voice, the one that brooked no nonsense. But the pool girl only grinned wider, clearly unfazed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, I’m just looking out for you,” the young woman said, casually lowering the net to her side. “You looked so comfortable. Didn’t want you waking up looking like a lobster.” She chuckled softly, clearly enjoying the little power shift in the exchange.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed, pushing her damp hair off her forehead. “I assure you, I’m capable of managing my own sun exposure.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The girl shrugged and held up her hands in mock surrender. “Suit yourself. Just trying to keep my favorite clients looking flawless.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opened her mouth to retort, then promptly closed it, entirely caught off guard. </span>
<em>
<span>Flawless?</span>
</em>
<span> Was this woman actually flirting with her?</span>
</p><p>
<span>But before she could formulate a response, the pool girl pulled off her sunglasses, hooking them on her tank top. Her eyes sparkled with mischief as she looked at Agatha. “Anyway, don’t let me stop you. I’m just here to clean up some leaves.” She tilted her head with a smirk. “Unless there’s anything else?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her face warm, and not from the sun this time. “Thank you, but I’m perfectly fine alone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The girl’s grin softened, turning from teasing to something almost gentle. “Got it, message received. But if you change your mind…” She tossed the net over her shoulder, turning toward the pool with a jaunty two-finger salute. “Just holler.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood, muttering to herself as she bundled up her robe, irritation simmering in her chest. She wasn’t used to feeling so… disarmed. Shaking her head, she left the pool area, telling herself she was <em>absolutely</em> not affected. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But as she retreated back into the house, she realized her pulse was still racing—and not entirely from annoyance. Agatha resolved to keep a proper distance from the pool girl, convinced that the brief, nerve-jangling encounter had been more than enough excitement for one day. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>The next day, Agatha sat by the pool with her morning coffee, a large pair of sunglasses shielding her gaze as she scanned the pages of a novel. She didn’t even look up when she heard the gate open, determined to ignore the girl’s arrival and maintain her composure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning!” the girl called, her voice dripping with sunshine. Agatha inclined her head ever so slightly, just enough to acknowledge her but not enough to encourage conversation. But the girl seemed undeterred, already strolling over to the side of the pool, crouching down to scoop a few stray leaves out with her net.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Must be a pretty good book,” she said, her tone casual. “Guess that explains why you haven’t noticed me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stiffened, pretending to be absorbed in the page. “I’m reading, I’m not interested in distractions.” She kept her tone clipped, aiming for disinterest, but a smile tugged at her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh-huh,” the girl replied, feigning disbelief. “Bet I could change that. You know, give you a more interesting story than that book.” She moved in closer, adding in a conspiratorial stage whisper, “If you’re brave enough.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t hold back a scoff, finally looking up from her novel. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Today the woman wore dark green tennis shorts and a matching oversized camp shirt held together by a single button. A white sports bra covered her chest but the outfit did nothing to hide her smooth tan stomach and slightly muscular tone. Agatha’s throat went slightly dry. She was confident in her appearance, even pushing 50 she knew she looked damn good. But even at her prime, she’d </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> looked like that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But if she had she knew she would’ve been shameless in showing it off just as the girl was doing now. And she couldn’t blame her. The hot pool guy, or pool girl, in this case, was a cliche for a reason. She couldn’t blame her game. Agatha imagined that it would be all too easy to spend her days flirting with bored housewives and offering either flattery or a thrill to pick up some extra tips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha wouldn’t be so easily charmed. Even in the privacy of her own home, she flushed slightly. A torrid affair with a girl half her age on the heels of the end of a decade-long marriage was far more scandal than she wanted to invite. That was deep into predictable midlife crisis territory. And she refused to be predictable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, she was never more thankful that she’d worn sunglasses today so that the girl couldn’t see her eyes wander appreciatively over her body. There was nothing wrong with appreciating a view. But as she felt her flush grow, threatening to expand beyond what her oversized sunglasses could hide, she quickly shook her head and regained her composure. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have no interest in whatever tall tales you might tell, thank you.” Her gaze met the girl’s familiar smirk, which was far too infectious. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She leaned on the net pole, grinning. “Aw, you wound me. Here I was thinking I was your favorite source of entertainment around here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Believe me, you flatter yourself.” Agatha sipped her coffee to hide her smile, but she knew she’d been caught.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where’s the nice one? She at least usually offers me a water bottle or something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha frowned and for a brief moment caught herself jealously wondering, </span>
<em>
<span>had they? </span>
</em>
<span>But she shook the thought from her head. No, her ex was many things, but if she could’ve been kept satisfied through sex alone she’d still be here.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry kid,” she sneered, “you’re stuck with the not nice one now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Heard. As long as I’m still getting paid, I’m not picky.” She raised her hand towards Agatha in a mock salute before heading back to her work. But just as she reached the pool, she turned, calling out, “Name’s Rio, by the way. Figured you’d want to know who’s stealing your peace and quiet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s retort died on her lips as she watched Rio saunter back to the water, all easy confidence and charm. Ridiculous, this girl was ridiculous. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She sighed and snapped the book shut before heading inside.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, not to be outdone by her ex, call it an insurance policy, she returned briefly outside with a bottle of Gatorade in her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned at her knowingly and opened her mouth her mouth to make some clever comment. But Agatha didn’t allow her, she tossed the bottle at her with more force than necessary before just as quickly returning inside. She </span>
<em>
<span>absolutely did not</span>
</em>
<span> let the ease with which the woman caught one-handed out of the air affect her. She certainly didn’t notice the curve of her bicep flex as she did so.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Inside, Agatha shut the sliding door with a huff, feeling her pulse race at the exchange. Ridiculous. This whole situation was absurd, but she couldn’t deny there was a thrill in it—a thrill she’d hardly felt in years, if ever. But it just had to be the change of pace, the novelty of it all. She was a woman who appreciated intellect, stability, wit—all traits she’d found in her ex. But those hadn’t been enough.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her thoughts kept returning to Rio. The way she smirked, completely unbothered by Agatha’s icy demeanor, like she could see right through her. And Agatha couldn’t ignore her attraction, no matter how much she tried. The woman was just so confident, so at ease with herself, and maybe that was what made it so enticing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d never been one to be pursued so openly; her usual partners were intellectuals, serious-minded women who preferred cocktails to sports drinks and long conversations to flirtatious banter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In a moment of sheer indulgence, she found herself imagining what it would be like to give in a bit to the overt flirting. She imagined herself spread on her stomach on the lounge chairs, asking Rio to help her apply sunscreen. The preposterous scenario played out in her mind—Rio’s hands warm and confident on her back, that easygoing smile as she teased her. The thought alone sent a small thrill up her spine before she caught herself, mortified.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Absolutely not,</span>
</em>
<span> she thought, banishing the fantasy with a sharp mental reprimand. Here she was, weeks out of a bruising divorce, fantasizing about a young woman barely half her age. </span>
<em>
<span>The absurdity,</span>
</em>
<span> she thought, rubbing her temples. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She had no business entertaining even a passing fancy for someone so obviously just looking to pass the time. This was all a bit of fun for Rio, no doubt, and probably a regular act to make sure she got an extra few bucks each visit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her ex had been the one for grand gestures, for taking the world by storm with her free-spirited ways—until it had all crumbled under the weight of Agatha’s ambitions. </span>
<em>
<span>Emotional neglect</span>
</em>
<span> the court had called it, her wife’s little jab etched in legalese for all eternity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And yet here she was, imagining frivolous excuses to bring the pool girl closer.</span>
<em>
<span> Get a grip, Agatha,</span>
</em>
<span> she scolded herself, realizing she hadn’t even read a word of the chapter she’d tried to focus on by the pool.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a heavy sigh, she leaned against the kitchen counter, resolute that this—whatever this flirtation was—would go no further. She’d focus on getting back to work soon enough. But as she looked out the window, her eyes lingered, catching sight of Rio by the pool, laughing softly to herself as she finished her work.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned away from the window with a huff. She didn’t care, she told herself. After all, it was just a ridiculous little moment. To give it any more weight than that would be foolish. Agatha </span>
<em>
<span>wasn’t</span>
</em>
<span> a foolish woman.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She stormed up the stairs and forced herself into a cold shower.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>A few days later, Agatha was attempting to relax, trying out the yoga mat that had been gathering dust in the corner of her bedroom. But right as she worked on balancing in a warrior pose, she heard a familiar voice call out from behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nice form,” Rio observed, a chuckle barely suppressed. “Could use a little work on the stance, though.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s concentration slipped, and she stumbled out of the pose, turning with a glare. “Do you make a habit of popping up unannounced?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Take it easy lady, just adding some chemicals, I’ll be gone in a jiffy” Rio shot back, winking. She set down her net and strolled over, placing her hands on her hips. “But if you need a trainer…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, rolling her eyes. “Let me guess you’re a certified yoga instructor as your side gig?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nope, but I know a thing or two about staying limber.” Rio’s grin broadened, clearly enjoying Agatha’s thinly veiled fluster.  “Just think about it. I’d make a good workout buddy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, keeping her face neutral even as her pulse quickened. “I’ll keep that in mind.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio winked at her before heading over to the pool, swinging the jug of chlorine in her hand as she whistled. It was a hot day and Agatha couldn’t help but notice how her shirt clung to the sweat on her back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going to get some water,” Agatha said in a rush, “want some?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure that’d be great,” she called back, shooting an easy smile over her shoulder as she knelt by the pool, “thanks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned on her heel, the kitchen feeling hotter than the day outside. Filling a glass from the Brita pitcher, she glanced out the window toward the pool again, stealing another look at Rio. She was crouched over, swirling a test strip in the water, the light glancing off her tanned skin and damp shirt. </span>
<em>
<span>Ridiculous,</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha reminded herself again, giving herself a small shake.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She went to refill the pitcher at the sink, and as she twisted the faucet handle, a loud</span>
<em>
<span> pop</span>
</em>
<span> sounded from under the counter. Suddenly, a jet of cold water sprayed from the pipe, dousing her blouse and splashing across her face. Agatha stumbled back with a cry, throwing her arms up defensively as the water continued to pour out, drenching her kitchen floor. "You have got to be fucking kidding me!" she shouted, trying in vain to block the gushing spray with her hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A moment later, she heard a voice from behind. “You okay in there?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She whipped her head around to find Rio poking her head through the door, one brow raised in amusement. "No," Agatha snapped, wiping water from her face. "Does it look like I’m okay?"</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned. “Fair point. Looks like you’ve got a burst pipe. You need to turn off the water valve before you’re swimming in here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clenched her jaw, the frustration clear on her face. “I don’t— I don’t know where that is.” She hated the admission; it sounded helpless, and she was far from helpless. Or at least she liked to think so.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Unbothered, Rio stepped inside. “No problem, I can find it,” she said, bending down and peering under the sink without hesitation. Within moments, she found the valve, twisting it until the water finally ceased its relentless flow. She straightened up and gave Agatha a once-over, smirking as she took in the soaked state of her blouse. “Gimme a minute. I’ll grab my tool belt from the truck and get that fixed up for you,” she said, casual and cheerful.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha folded her arms over her chest, feeling absurdly exposed despite the soaked fabric sticking to her skin. “Thank you,” she muttered, trying to reclaim some semblance of dignity.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio just chuckled and breezed out the front door. Agatha rolled her eyes, though she couldn’t help noticing how Rio’s shirt was now soaked through as well.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha busied herself with grabbing towels to mop up the floor, cursing under her breath. She was supposed to be relaxing on this so-called “break,” but instead, she was practically drowning in her own kitchen, and now… now she needed the help of her insufferably charming pool girl.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A few minutes later, Rio returned, tool belt swinging with each step and a grin on her face that was entirely too self-assured for Agatha’s taste. "All right, let's see what kind of damage we’re dealing with," Rio said, dropping down to inspect the pipe, the toned muscles in her arms flexing as she worked. Agatha turned away, feeling slightly bashful. Here she was, a decorated attorney with hundreds of cases under her belt, feeling flustered by girl who happened to be some versatile jack of all trades fixing her plumbing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up from her work, catching Agatha staring at the counter instead of at her. “Good news is, it’s an easy fix,” she said, flashing that familiar smile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” Agatha replied curtly, folding her arms tighter around herself. She refused to be drawn in by the casual confidence Rio exuded, yet there she was, feeling more flustered by the moment. Rio gave her another once-over, clearly noticing her discomfort.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Water should be back on in a jiffy,” she said, tightening the pipe fitting. “But you’re gonna want to let it drain a bit before using it.” She stood, brushing her hands off on her shorts, a smudge of grease on her wrist. “And maybe dry off before you catch cold?” Her tone was warm, a hint of teasing, but Agatha could hear the genuine concern.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips quirked, just barely, as she held back a sigh. “I was…going to, thank you.” The warmth in Rio’s gaze made her suddenly self-conscious, and she looked away, hoping Rio didn’t notice the faint blush warming her cheeks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned, clearly pleased with herself. “It’s not a problem. You’re welcome. And hey, thanks for the drink,” she added, motioning toward the glass of water on the counter. She downed it in one go, the action somehow managing to look graceful, then placed the glass neatly in the sink.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With her work finished, Rio headed back for the door. “If anything else springs a leak, you know who to call,” she said with a wink, heading out as casually as she’d come. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched her go, that signature smirk still lingering in her mind. She clenched her jaw, determined not to let this absurd situation get under her skin, yet knowing full well it already had. </span>
<em>
<span>Ridiculous.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>When she heard the hum of Rio’s truck fade down the street, she made her way upstairs still grumbling to herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers worked absently at the buttons of her shirt, her mind swirling. She scolded herself for letting someone as seemingly carefree as Rio occupy so much space in her thoughts. Rio was so unbothered, so laid-back. Everything neither her ex-wife or she had ever been. And, Agatha realized with a jolt, that difference threatened her to feel something far deeper than just a passing physical attraction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That thought rattled her. She hardly knew this woman. How could Rio’s easy charm feel like anything more than a trivial distraction? With a scoff, she shook her head, deciding not to entertain the idea. She had better things to do than dwell on some absurd notion of connection with a young, flirty pool girl.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let her shirt fall to the floor as she stepped into her bedroom. She stripped off the rest of her clothes, letting herself fall back onto the cool sheets, deliberately pushing any stray thoughts about Rio's humor, her confidence, or the strange warmth she left in her wake to the side. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She refused to dwell on the way Rio’s eyes sparkled whenever she threw a quip her way, or the sly glances she seemed to catch, as though Rio had been studying her for longer than Agatha realized.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, Agatha turned her thoughts to something simpler: the curve of Rio’s bicep flexing as she’d tightened the pipe, the ease with which she’d handled the tools, the glint in her eye that somehow felt like a dare. She could let herself linger there, imagining Rio’s hands, her grip steady and sure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she closed her eyes, allowing herself this indulgence, Agatha told herself that it was nothing more than lust. She just needed to release some pent-up tension. It had been a while, even before their divorce had been finalized they’d long stopped sharing the same bed. She just needed to get off That was all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She idly trailed her hand over her chest, brushing her thumb over her nipple. Her other hand drifted towards her thighs. Agatha let her eyes close, a small smile tugging at her lips as her mind wandered. She could almost feel Rio’s hands, warm and roughened, trailing down her arms, that easy grin hovering just a bit too close. The memory of Rio’s low, teasing voice echoed in her mind, words meant to fluster and unnerve her as much as they made her feel seen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She imagined the gentle press of Rio’s fingers lingering at her waist. She pictured her pulling her closer, her gaze steady and mischievous as if to say, </span>
<em>
<span>I knew you'd come around.</span>
</em>
<span> The thought sent a thrill through her, and she allowed herself to sink further into the daydream, savoring the playful, magnetic pull she felt every time they met.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment she considered grabbing the lube from her nightstand but as her fingers dipped between her legs it was evident that it wouldn’t be needed. As she pressed her two fingers into herself she considered if Rio’s hands would be soft and gentle or if they’d carry firm callouses. She wondered what she was like in bed, if she’d go slow and take her time or if she’d be rough and demanding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha settled on the latter and when she came, she did so biting her tongue to keep the girl’s name out of her mouth.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>After two weeks off, Agatha was itching to return to work. She needed a distraction from, well, </span>
<em>
<span>her distraction</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha fished her phone from her purse and dialed Lilia’s number, tapping her nails impatiently as she waited for her partner to pick up. The familiar voice came through, warm and direct, with that hint of cool authority Agatha had learned to respect, even if it did occasionally get under her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>"Agatha! How’s the R&amp;R treating you?" Lilia asked, her tone carrying a hint of amusement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m ready to come back,” Agatha replied, not bothering to sugarcoat it. “I need something to do that isn’t lounging by the pool.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a pause, and Agatha could practically hear Lilia’s shrewd mind weighing how best to handle this. "I understand, but you know as well as I do that coming back now isn’t ideal. You’ve just wrapped two intense cases back-to-back. Not to mention your personal matters. Take a little more time. The firm isn’t going anywhere."</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opened her mouth to protest, but Lilia cut in smoothly. “Listen, Agatha, I know you’re itching for routine, but we’ve got the Jefferson case coming in two weeks. That one has </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> written all over it—messy family dynamics, high stakes, perfect for your expertise. I’d hate for you to come back just to lose your edge before you even sink your teeth in. We need you fresh.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her objection falter. The Jefferson’s had threatened a messy ugly divorce for years. If it was finally happening it would be the kind that demanded a sharp mind and plenty of patience. It would be the exact kind of work she could throw herself into fully. </span>
</p><p>
<span>With a sigh, she leaned back, resigning herself. "Alright, Lilia. Two weeks. But the second they sign a contract…"</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ll be the first one I call,” Lilia promised. “Enjoy the sun while it lasts, Agatha. The work will always be here.” </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>Agatha hung up, unwilling to admit even to herself that her partner had a point.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sun was high, casting a golden warmth over the yard as Agatha waited by the pool, reclining on a lounger in a swimsuit she hadn’t dared to wear in years. Its deep neckline and high-cut sides revealed enough that she could almost hear her ex-wife’s disapproving voice in her head. But today, that voice was irrelevant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She adjusted her sunglasses, heart thudding in a way she hadn’t felt in years, as she heard the gate open and Rio strolled in, casually swinging her net pole.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning,” Rio greeted her with her usual cheeky grin. But her eyes did a quick double-take, glancing over Agatha with barely disguised surprise. “Looks like someone’s embracing the pool life.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirked, letting herself feel a spark of satisfaction at the flicker of surprise on Rio’s face. “I figured it was finally time to make use of this place properly,” she replied, resting an elbow on her lounger and meeting Rio’s gaze. “Besides, wouldn’t want you to be the only one enjoying the view.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raised an eyebrow, clearly thrown. “Can’t say I’m complaining.” She leaned on her net pole, her usual confidence faltering for a split second before her grin returned. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stretched languidly on the lounger, arching her back just enough to catch Rio’s gaze again. She knew the effect it would have and found herself reveling in it, enjoying the slight flush that rose on Rio’s cheeks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you sure you’re not?” Agatha teased, tilting her head with a playful smirk. “You look a little… flustered.” She let her tone linger, watching as Rio’s mouth opened as if to reply, only for her words to vanish into a slightly sheepish laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Flustered? Me?” Rio shook her head, clearly scrambling for her usual confidence. “I, uh… just didn’t realize you ever actually used the pool.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, today I plan on it,” Agatha replied, crossing one leg over the other and giving Rio a once-over as if assessing her. “I’m just waiting for you to be ready.” She couldn’t help but chuckle as she saw Rio scrambling to decide whether this was an invitation or just a tease. The tables had turned, and Agatha was firmly in control, and she relished every second of it. This was more like it. Why hadn’t she been doing this all along?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right,” Rio mumbled, clearly rattled as she turned to focus intently on the pool, making a show of dipping the pole in and clearing a few stray leaves. “Almost done here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned forward, resting her chin on her hand, and watched her with amusement. “Take your time, sweetheart,” she said, letting the endearment roll off her tongue as if it was the most natural thing in the world. She saw Rio’s hand pause mid-sweep, and for a brief moment, Rio looked over her shoulder, eyebrows raised.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged, pretending innocence as she stood, stretched once more, and walked past her to the pool’s edge. “Looks good enough,” she replied smoothly before diving into the water with a graceful arc, the cool splash breaking the silence that followed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she surfaced, Rio was still standing by the edge, looking stunned but highly entertained, her own smirk creeping back. Agatha gave her a satisfied smile, feeling a thrill at having taken control of their little game, for once completely and unapologetically on her terms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let herself float in the cool water, her smirk widening when she noticed Rio still hovering at the pool's edge, shifting from foot to foot like she was trying to come up with an excuse to stay.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Need a lifeguard?” Rio asked, tilting her head with a playful grin. “I mean, you talk a big game, but I’ve never actually seen you swim.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed. “I’ll be fine, thanks,” she replied, her tone breezy. “I think I can manage a few laps without any help. But I’ll keep you in mind if I get into trouble.” She winked, enjoying the faint blush that crept up Rio’s cheeks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave a reluctant nod, her grin fading just a bit as she rubbed the back of her neck, clearly trying to think of one last thing to say before leaving. “Alright, alright. But you know where to find me if anything… if you need anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Duly noted,” Agatha replied smoothly, giving a lazy wave of her hand. “And thank you, Rio. For the pool, I mean. You’ve done good work.” She saw Rio’s eyes light up just a bit at the compliment, and Agatha couldn’t help the warmth in her own smile. “Now, go on. You must have more fun things to do with your weekend than babysit me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right. Sure,” Rio said, nodding a little too quickly, almost stumbling as she took a step back. She recovered with a quick wink, flashing her usual charming smile. “Enjoy the water, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>With one last look, she finally turned and left, and Agatha watched her go, savoring the victory. But as Rio’s truck rumbled down the street and silence settled back over the pool, Agatha found herself staring at the empty gate, almost disappointed by the quiet she’d been so sure she wanted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She let out a breath and sank deeper into the water, her fingers trailing along the rippling surface.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>A few days passed, and Agatha found herself waiting with an edge of anticipation she hadn’t felt in years. It was ridiculous, she told herself, how easily Rio had wormed her way under her skin, making her look forward to these visits with a thrill that had no place in her life. But she couldn’t deny it, and when she saw Rio's truck pull up, she barely managed to keep her face neutral.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Today, Rio had shown up in a tank top that showed off her shoulders and that faded flower and vine tattoo that crept around her left shoulder. She had barely stepped through the gate when Agatha gave her a smirk, as if daring her to make the first move.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Someone’s finally dressed for the heat,” Agatha remarked, resting a hand on her hip as Rio set her supplies down. “Or are you just trying to show off?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, seemingly unfazed, but Agatha didn’t miss the quick glance she threw her way. “Just dressing for the weather,” Rio said, her voice light, though her gaze lingered for a fraction longer than usual. “Not my fault if it’s appreciated.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, trust me,” Agatha replied, arching a brow. “It’s not unappreciated.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s laughter faded into something quieter, her eyes taking on that familiar, playful glint. “That right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha crossed her arms, leaning casually against the lounger as Rio got to work. She could feel her own pulse thrumming, each exchange of banter only adding to the heat simmering in the air between them. Eventually, Rio looked up from the filter, her eyes sharper than usual.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know, I can’t tell if you’re actually enjoying this,” Rio teased, “or if you’re just seeing how far you can push me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, leaning forward a bit, her gaze locked on Rio’s. “Maybe a bit of both.” She could feel her heart racing, her pulse pounding with the thrill of closing the distance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Careful,” Rio murmured, her tone lower, nearly challenging. “You might get more than you bargained for.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Promise?” The word slipped out before Agatha could catch it, her voice breathier than she intended, and she saw Rio’s gaze darken in response. The air between them felt electric, and neither of them moved, caught in the charged space that stretched thinner with every second.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, Rio broke the silence, her voice barely above a whisper. “You don’t know what you’re asking for.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t I?” She raised her hand and curled one finger, beckoning the girl over to her. “Come, sit.” A thrill passed through her as Rio heeded her call and walked over to her. She sifted slightly on the lounger to give some room for the girl to perch on the lounger next to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Through all their teasing, they had never been this physically close to one another.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath hitched, a surge of something wild rising in her. Without thinking, she reached out, her fingers brushing Rio’s arm before sliding up to her shoulder. She saw Rio’s eyes widen, the bravado slipping just a little, and in that moment, the last of her own restraint broke. </span>
</p><p>
<span>In one swift motion, she closed the distance, pulling Rio toward her and pressing her lips to hers, tasting the surprise that melted quickly into a heated response. Rio’s hands found her waist, pulling her closer as Agatha deepened the kiss, letting herself be swept up in the dizzying thrill of finally giving in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Every inch of her felt alive, the tension between them dissolving in the warmth of Rio’s mouth, the softness of her skin. Agatha ran a hand through Rio’s hair, tugging just enough to hear the soft gasp that escaped her, savoring the heady satisfaction of having shattered the careful distance they’d kept for far too long.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, Agatha pulled back just enough to look into Rio’s eyes, their breaths mingling as she took in the sight of her—flushed, breathless, and smiling like this was exactly where she’d wanted to be. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” Agatha murmured, her voice still thick with desire, “that was overdue.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve been such a tease,” Rio hummed. “I thought, but I wasn’t sure…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The air between them was thick with the tension that had been building for days, weeks—longer than either of them was willing to admit. Rio’s breath was warm against Agatha’s lips, the teasing smile replaced by something darker, more intense. The space between their bodies was electric, charged with desire.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Without another word, Rio leaned forward, hands on Agatha’s shoulders as she straddled her, the shift in position sending a shockwave of desire through Agatha’s. The feel of Rio’s bare thighs against hers was enough to leave her breathless, but it was the heat in Rio’s eyes—wild and unrestrained—that made Agatha’s pulse spike.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart hammered in her chest as Rio’s fingers threaded into her hair, tugging her head back to expose the line of her throat. The move was a deliberate one. As if Rio wanted to see her vulnerable, to watch her lose control. And Agatha, to her surprise, didn’t fight it. Instead, she leaned into the touch, her body craving more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s lips crashed onto hers, forceful, hungry. The kiss was all teeth and desperation. Agatha groaned as she felt her tongue press greedily into her mouth. She slid her hands up Rio’s back, her fingers digging into the firm muscle beneath her shirt as she kissed her back with an equal, burning urgency. The world outside seemed to vanish—there was only the heat, the pull, and the dizzying desire that drowned out all rational thought.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The lounger creaked beneath them as Agatha leaned back, her body sinking into the cushion as Rio hovered over her, unrelenting. Every movement, every brush of skin against skin, pushed Agatha further into the spiral of this reckless attraction. Her breath came fast, shallow, her pulse racing with anticipation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s lips trailed down Agatha’s jawline, over the curve of her neck, her teeth grazing lightly against her skin. Agatha’s fingers tightened in her hair, urging Rio back up, pulling her into another kiss, deeper this time—more daring. The taste of Rio was intoxicating, the feel of her hands on Agatha’s skin sending jolts of heat through her veins. </span>
</p><p>
<span>For the first time in a long time, Agatha stopped thinking. She didn’t care about the consequences, the complications of it all. All that mattered was Rio—the way she felt beneath her hands, the way their bodies seemed to fit together perfectly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She needed <em>more</em>.</span>

<p>Agatha swallowed, feeling the warmth in her cheeks as she tugged Rio’s shirt free, letting her fingers graze over warm, sun-kissed skin. “You’re very generous with your services,” she teased, though a faint edge of genuine curiosity slipped through. “Do all the neighbors get this special attention?”</p><p>Rio laughed, low and easy, unbothered by the question. Her gaze never left Agatha’s, her eyes glinting with something both playful and reassuring. “Flirting’s just flirting,” she replied, her voice a soft murmur. “But no—I don’t go around doing this for anyone else. None of them are nearly as interesting.” She moved her hands to pull Agatha’s robe loose, pulling it down and away from her before leaning over to kiss at her jaw.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth twitched with a half-smile, still not quite satisfied. “No girlfriend?” She arched an eyebrow, testing, probing. “Or someone closer to your own age?”</p><p>Rio shook her head, looking almost amused by the thought. “Not my style,” she answered, brushing a stray strand of hair from Agatha’s cheek. Her fingers lingered there, light and deliberate. “I like women who know who they are, who have a little more… life to them. More mature women. I like the way they carry themselves, the stories they have, the confidence. They’re sure of what they want.”</p><p>Agatha held her breath as Rio’s words washed over her. She could feel her pulse thrumming in her ears, caught off guard by the tenderness in Rio’s gaze, the way she seemed genuinely fascinated by her. Her own insecurities faded, replaced by a raw sense of excitement she hadn’t felt in years.</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened as she searched Agatha’s face. “So…” She leaned in, her voice a gentle whisper as she brushed her lips just over Agatha’s, not quite closing the distance. “Do you know what you want, Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha felt the weight of the question settle over her, filling the air between them. She hesitated, for once unsure. The words hovered on the edge of her tongue, but they wouldn’t come, tangled in the complex web of desire.</p><p>Her hands slid up Rio’s arms, pulling her close, her touch almost reverent as she finally admitted, in a soft, barely-there murmur, “I don’t know. I just… don’t want you to stop.”</p><p>A slow, understanding smile spread across Rio’s face, and she leaned in, her lips brushing gently over Agatha’s. “I can work with that.”</p><p>Again she kissed her, and Agatha groaned as she felt her roll her hips against her. Quick fingers moved to untie and remove the haltered bikini top she wore and Agatha privately praised her foresight to wear something that was easy to remove.</p><p>“Fuck you’re hot,” Rio groaned before bending her head and moving to bury her face against Agatha’s breast. Immediately Agatha wrapped her hand in her hair, holding her there against her. The firm tug seemed to just spur the younger woman on more and she nipped softly at the soft skin there.</p><p>Agatha grabbed eagerly at the edge of the bandeau Rio wore, pulling it up and away. Rio grumbled slightly as she was forced to move her lips away. “I wasn’t done there.”</p><p>“I’m not stopping you, but you shouldn’t be the only one getting to enjoy a view,” Agatha teased. She laughed as Rio sat up straight for a moment and playfully flexed an arm. “God, never mind, forget I said anything. If your head gets any bigger it won’t一”</p><p>She was cut off as Rio leaned down against her again and kissed away her teasing comment. </p><p>“Too late,” Rio chuckled as she moved her lips back to her breast. “The hottest woman I’ve ever seen is letting me ravish her in the middle of the day next to her fancy ass pool. My ego couldn’t possibly couldn’t get any bigger.”</p><p>Agatha’s responding laugh choked into a moan as her tongue brushed over her nipple. “And here I thought with all your teasing that you planned this.” She reached to palm Rio’s ass pulling her closer, grinning as the woman groaned eagerly.</p><p>“No,” Rio murmured, moving her lips to the other side. “I mean, I definitely <em> dreamed </em> about this,” she looked up long enough to wink up at her. “But no, I didn’t plan this. I’m really fucking delighted to be here though.” She moved back off of Agatha’s hips and moved her legs to the side so she could kneel between them. Rio let her fingers dip under the waistband of Agatha’s linen shorts. “There’s something else I’ve been dreaming of,” she hummed as she rolled the waistband slightly, glancing up at Agatha with a cheeky smile.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and lifted her hips up. “Do you ever stop talking,” she teased.</p><p>Rio gave her another playful wink as she gently removed her shorts and lifted one of Agatha’s legs over her shoulder. “I’m about to.” She pressed a kiss to her knee before leaning her head down. For a moment Agatah felt a little self-conscious but that fleeting thought left her the second she felt Rio’s lips press against her.</p><p>Agatha moaned and leaned back fully against the lounge chair. She let Rio’s hands at her hips pull her down further and closer to her. As her tongue swiped up against her Agatha threw her arm across her forehead, shielding her eyes from the bright sun.</p><p>Rio’s tongue pressed inside her and she whimpered, blindly reaching down to grasp her firm shoulder, canting her hips up closer to her eager mouth. She let the leg not draped over Rio’s shoulder fall to the side of the chair, spreading herself more as she planted her foot against the warm pavement.</p><p>Everything was so hot. The sun, the body pressed against her, the tongue working inside her. She gave herself over to the feeling, moaning eagerly and without any of her usual restraint. “Rio, more,” her words came out in a stutter as she moved her arm to look down at her. </p><p>The woman looked up at her and smiled, her face wet half from the sun and half from Agatha. “Gladly.” She purred, propping herself up on one elbow and moving her other hand to press two fingers inside Agatha. Her head dropped again and she pressed a gentle kiss to her clit before drawing it between her lips.</p><p>It didn’t take Agatha long after that and she cried out sharply as all of her pent up desire, frustration, and walls came crashing over her all at once. Rio stayed between her legs, kissing and licking gently through the aftershocks of her orgasm. She only moved her head away when Agatha wrapped her hand in her hair and tugged, pulling her back up to kiss her lazily.</p><p>“That一” Agatha gasped, running her hand through Rio’s touseled hair, “was the best I’ve felt in fucking years.”</p><p>Rio quirked an eyebrow at her and smiled smugly. “Years? I thought you <em> just </em> got divorced.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and shrugged realizing what she had admitted to the girl and to herself. “I said what I said.” </p><p>Rio laughed too in that easy way of hers before gently brushing Agatha’s hair away from her face. “Well, the pleasure’s all mine.” She leaned down and kissed her again, unhurried now, but her hands still roamed freely up and down her arms and sides.</p><p>The lounge chair creaked slightly underneath them and Agatha shifted uncomfortably her back catching slightly. Quickly Rio lifted her weight away moving onto her knees. “Do you need to sit up? I can一”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha shook her head, “Don’t. I’m not done with you. Just switch places with me.” She stood for a moment and rolled her shoulders as Rio quickly removed her shorts and reclined on the lounger, tucking both arms behind her head. Agatha settled back on top of her, eager to kiss away her stupid cocky smirk. </p><p>Rio was eager and vocal, her hands quickly moving to grasp at Agatha, pulling her closer and roaming freely over her back. “It’s not gonna take me long,” she husked, her voice low and rough. “I don’t know if you heard me before but you’re the hottest fucking一”</p><p>“Hush.” Agatha said, leaning down to kiss her. She moved her hand between Rio’s legs and moaned against her mouth as she felt how wet she was. “Do you ever stop talking?” Her own voice was raspy as she pressed her fingers inside her her thumb falling to circle against her clit.</p><p>Rio whined beneath her, eagerly rocking her hips back up against her. “If I ever stop telling you how hot you are check for a pulse because it means I’m dead,” she husked, propping herself up on her elbows to lean forward and kiss Agatha again.</p><p>Agatha felt a surge of pride as she quickly unraveled the girl beneath her. Even when she wasn’t talking, Rio was loud, and for a moment Agatha’s mind drifted to the neighbors who were likely getting an earful. But as Rio came with a cry of her name, Agatha realized that she didn’t give a shit what they thought.</p><p>She removed her fingers and kissed Rio gently, before moving to stand and pull her robe back around herself. Rio looked up at her with heavy eyes still panting slightly. “Is this uh, is that your cue for me to get out of here?” She asked with a smile, though Agatha caught something that seemed small in her voice.</p><p>She shook her head and bent to kiss her again, letting her hand trail against her cheek for a moment. “You don’t have to go.” Agatha considered her next words carefully but seeing as she had already thrown caution to the wind… it wouldn’t hurt to let her stay a little longer. It seemed  too transactional not to mention rude to just kick her out. “But I think we should both get out of the sun. It’s hot out here.”</p><p>“Yeah it is,” Rio responded with a suggestive wag of her eyebrows. She hopped off the chair and pulled her shorts and tank back on.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes fondly before opening the door and heading inside. The blast of the air conditioning chilled her in an almost sobering way. But she didn’t have a chance to second guess herself before Rio followed her inside and wrapped her arms around her waist. “Hey, seriously. That was <em> really </em> fun,” she murmured, kissing the back of her neck in a way that made her shiver.</p><p>Agatha smiled and turned to kiss Rio again. </p><p>Agatha lingered in Rio’s embrace for a moment before pulling back with a soft smile. "Are you hungry?” she asked, her voice hesitant but warm. “I, um… I don’t cook. My ex-wife handled that sort of thing. But I’m very good at ordering takeout.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Sure, I like takeout”</p><p>They ended up ordering from a small Italian spot Agatha liked—one of those places that took pizza seriously, with thin, blistered crusts and a long list of unusual toppings. As they debated what to get, they landed on olives and mushrooms, a combination Agatha remembered her ex had always been disgusted by.</p><p>Once the food arrived, they settled onto Agatha’s oversized sectional, the pizza box open between them and two glasses of wine balanced on a tray. Agatha felt herself unwinding in a way that was unfamiliar, laughing freely as they swapped stories. It was comfortable, almost disarmingly so, and she found herself glancing at Rio with curiosity, wondering about this young woman who’d somehow caught her attention so thoroughly.</p><p>After a moment’s hesitation, Agatha looked at Rio, folding one leg beneath herself. “I don’t know that I want to know. But I’m going to ask anyway, how old are you?”</p><p>Rio grinned and took a sip of wine. “I’m twenty-eight,” she replied, glancing over at Agatha. “Is that going to scare you off?”</p><p>Agatha smirked, raising an eyebrow. “Only a little,” she teased, though she was surprised at the rush of relief she felt. “Twenty-eight, huh? And you’re a… student?” She tilted her head, watching Rio’s reaction carefully. </p><p>“Yep. Graduate student. Engineering,” Rio said, nodding with a satisfied smile.</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly, trying to reconcile her surprise. “An engineer. I didn’t see that coming,” she admitted, watching as Rio took another bite of pizza, looking completely at ease.</p><p>Rio chuckled, leaning back into the soft cushions of the sectional. “I get that a lot. Most people assume I’d be in, I don’t know, something artsy or something. I don’t really give off an academic vibe I guess. But I’ve always liked solving problems—and, well, engineering is about as much of that as you can get.”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow, intrigued. “And here I thought you were just here for the free access to my pool.”</p><p>“Oh, that’s a definite perk,” Rio said with a laugh, eyes glinting.</p><p>Agatha blinked, trying to picture the laid-back, witty woman next to her buried in equations and blueprints. “So, next question, what the hell are you doing moonlighting as a pool cleaner?”</p><p>Rio shrugged, biting into a slice of pizza. “My stipend isn’t exactly generous. And I spend so much time inside studying, it’s nice to be out here in the sun once in a while.” She grinned. “Plus, meeting people like you isn’t a bad perk.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, taking a sip of her wine to hide a small smile. “I can imagine the neighbors must be heartbroken you’re spending all this time at my house.”</p><p>Rio laughed. “There might be a few who’ve asked me to… linger, but they’re not nearly as interesting.” She leaned back, watching Agatha with a soft, teasing look. “You’re… different.”</p><p>Agatha felt herself flush slightly, caught off guard by the compliment. She glanced down, unsure of how to respond to the warmth building between them, this strange, unexpected connection that felt both thrilling and a little terrifying.</p><p>She took a long sip of the wine, savoring the taste before glancing over at Rio. She hadn’t meant to open this particular bottle. It was one she’d picked up with her ex-wife on a vacation to Italy, an indulgent purchase on a trip that was supposed to save their marriage. But here she was, sharing it with someone who somehow made the occasion feel worth it. </p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, watching Agatha with an amused look. “This is really good wine,” she said, tilting her glass thoughtfully. “I’m guessing it’s, what… worth about half my rent?”</p><p>Agatha laughed, rolling her eyes. “Don’t think about it like that. But maybe,” she teased, leaning back with a smirk, “there have to be some perks to hooking up with older women.”</p><p>Rio’s laughter softened, and she turned to Agatha with a gentle look that took her by surprise. “There’s a lot more to like about you than just that,” she murmured, her voice genuine. “This isn’t just some, I don’t know, kink for me, or whatever. I mean, I like your age, sure, but it’s not the most interesting thing about you.”</p><p>Agatha’s smirk faltered as her gaze met Rio’s, and for a moment, the air between them stilled. She opened her mouth, feeling her usual witty response fizzle out. Instead, she gave a small, vulnerable smile, feeling more seen in that moment than she had in some time.</p><p>She leaned in, her lips curling into a coy smile. “Oh really? So, if it’s not my age, what is it?” she asked, her voice teasing but her gaze steady.</p><p>Rio chuckled, a faint blush creeping up her cheeks. “Oh, you’re going to make me say it?”</p><p>“Yes, I am,” Agatha replied, her smile widening. “Go on, impress me.”</p><p>Rio let out a soft laugh, glancing down at her glass before looking back up at Agatha. “Alright, if you insist.” She took a breath, meeting Agatha’s eyes with a sincerity that caught her off guard. “I like how you’re not afraid to say what’s on your mind. You’re confident, and you don’t pretend to be anyone you’re not. I know I’ll get the truth from you, even if it’s wrapped up in sarcasm.” She paused, her voice growing softer. “And you’ve got this… strength, you know? Like you’ve been through a lot but still somehow came out sharper.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, her usual composure slipping as she felt Rio’s words hit deeper than she’d expected. She swallowed, fighting back the warmth rising to her cheeks. “Well,” she said, her voice a little quieter than she intended, “you certainly don’t hold back, do you?”</p><p>“Hey, you asked,” Rio said with a grin, her voice lightening again. She leaned in closer, her gaze playful. “But if you’re looking for me to keep going, I’d be happy to oblige.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, biting back a smile as she sipped her wine. “I think I’ve heard enough for now. You’re certainly a charmer.”</p><p>Rio smiled and shrugged before finishing her glass. “I just call it like I see it.”</p><p>Agatha felt her phone buzz as she refilled their glasses. She glanced down to see her ex’s name lighting up the screen. The message was short, but it carried an unmistakable tension.</p><p>
<em> "I found some things of yours. Want me to drop it off, or would you rather I mailed it?" </em>
</p><p> Agatha frowned, her grip on her phone tightening as an unexpected wave of irritation—and something like dread—washed over her. The last thing she needed tonight was a reminder of her ex, especially now, when she’d managed to feel a little lighter, more at ease.</p><p>Rio noticed her reaction immediately. “Everything alright?”</p><p>Agatha forced a smile, setting her phone face down on the ottoman. “Just… an interruption I wasn’t expecting,” she said, brushing it off. But Rio’s gaze lingered, concern flickering behind her usual relaxed expression.</p><p>“From the ex?” Rio asked gently, her tone softer now.</p><p>Agatha sighed, nodding. “Unfortunately. The timing is impeccable, isn’t it?”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, a small, wry smile playing at her lips. “You know, we could ignore it. Finish our wine and let it wait until tomorrow. I mean, how often do you take a night off like this?”</p><p>Agatha looked at her, surprised by the earnestness in her voice. For once, someone was offering her a choice that didn’t involve obligation or expectation. She hesitated, glancing at her phone again, and then, with a slow exhale, turned her attention back to Rio.</p><p>“You’re right,” she said finally, feeling a weight lift as she spoke. “Tonight’s mine. She can wait.”</p><p>Rio’s smile grew, her eyes bright with approval. “That’s the spirit.” She leaned back against the couch, clinking her glass lightly against Agatha’s.</p><p>Agatha laughed, feeling the tension melt away. She clinked her glass back, savoring the moment, and took a sip of the rich, velvety wine. “Interested in another bottle?”</p><p>Rio smiled, “I’m not going to say no. Let me guess, this next one is a rare vintage from Turkey, no a honey mead from Greece?” </p><p>She rolled her eyes but instead of the cabinet opened the fridge, “No, the good stuff is for savoring. When you want to get drunk and ignore annoying messages from your ex, grocery store rosé is best.”</p><p>Rio laughed and allowed her glass to be refilled. For the rest of the evening, Agatha found herself leaning into Rio’s lighthearted presence, appreciating every little laugh, every easy smile. Eventually, she found herself back in her arms, leaning against her as they shared another bottle.</p><p>As the evening lingered on, Agatha let herself relax fully, each moment melting into the next. She felt Rio’s arm around her shoulders, the gentle brush of her fingers grazing her skin every so often, keeping her comfortably grounded in the present. The warmth from Rio’s closeness, the laughter they shared—it all felt natural like they’d been doing this for ages.</p><p>Eventually, the wine buzz settled over them both, and Agatha glanced at the two empty bottles on the table. She let out a small sigh, more of satisfaction than anything else, and tilted her head to look at Rio. “You know, I might actually be having fun.”</p><p>“Only ‘might’?” Rio teased, her smile growing as she looked down at Agatha, her eyes a little softer in the low light.</p><p>Agatha scoffed, playfully rolling her eyes. “Don’t let it go to your head.”</p><p>Rio smirked, her hand shifting slightly on Agatha’s shoulder as she brushed a stray lock of hair back behind Agatha’s ear. “Too late,” she whispered.</p><p>Their eyes met, and Agatha felt the air between them grow thicker, charged in a way that sent a spark through her. She raised an eyebrow, challenging. “And here I thought you’d already done enough to get my mind off things tonight.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, her gaze never wavering. “Maybe I could do a little more.”</p><p>The words were simple, but the intensity in her voice pulled Agatha in. For a moment she simply held Rio’s gaze, feeling the weight of the offer between them. With a slow smile, Agatha took Rio’s hand, guiding her to her feet. She didn’t say anything, just started leading her toward the stairs, her heart pounding as she felt Rio’s hand clasp hers a little tighter. </p><p>They made their way up to Agatha’s bedroom. Once inside, Rio closed the door behind them, and they stood for a moment in quiet anticipation. Agatha felt a thrill of freedom, the rush of something new, as she turned to Rio with an inviting look.</p><p>Rio grinned, her voice low as she leaned closer. “Guess I’m staying over, then?”</p><p>Agatha’s soft laugh was answer enough as she wrapped her arms around her, pulling Rio into a kiss that was all warmth, heat, and release. She tasted the wine on her lips as she let them fall into the bed together.</p><hr/><p>The morning light streamed through Agatha's bedroom, casting a soft glow across the room. She stretched, feeling the warmth of Rio beside her, and for a moment, everything felt right. But as she lay there, fully awake, the reality of the situation crept in. It wasn’t regret, exactly—she didn’t wish the night away or feel any lingering doubt about Rio herself. Yet, something about the way they’d rushed into this, without so much as a second thought about the complications or what came next, made her feel a bit exposed.</p><p>She glanced over at Rio, who was still sleeping peacefully, looking younger and more carefree than ever. Her insecurities whispered to her, and she began to wonder if maybe she had been foolish, letting herself get so swept away. With a soft sigh, she sat up, brushing a hand through her hair before nudging Rio's shoulder.</p><p>“Hey,” she said softly at first, then more firmly. “Time to wake up.”</p><p>Rio stirred, blinking sleepily at her, a sleepy smile tugging at her lips. “Morning…”</p><p>Agatha returned a small smile, but it didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Morning. You should probably get going, I’m sure you have plans for the day.” Her tone was cooler than she intended, but she couldn’t quite shake the feeling of needing space to think.</p><p>Rio picked up on it right away, her smile fading as she sat up. “Sure. Just… let me find my things.” She was trying to sound casual, but Agatha could tell she noticed the shift.</p><p>They had just made it to the staircase, with Agatha walking a step ahead when a knock sounded at the front door. Before Agatha could register what was happening, she heard the key turn door click open, and she froze, turning in disbelief as her ex-wife walked in.</p><p>The silence that followed was thick and immediate. Agatha’s throat went dry as she felt her ex-wife’s gaze flicker between her and Rio. The weight of old judgments lingered in the air, pressing down on her, making her painfully aware how the situation looked.</p><p>Rio quickly took in the tense atmosphere but remained relaxed. She turned to Agatha and, without a word, leaned in and pressed a gentle kiss to her cheek. “I’ll catch you later,” she murmured, giving her shoulder a reassuring squeeze before breezing past the other woman, leaving Agatha with one last glance that was warm, free of resentment or hurt.</p><p>As the door closed, Agatha stood there in silence, feeling the weight of the encounter settle around her. Her ex-wife crossed her arms, raising an eyebrow as if to challenge her to explain. But for once, Agatha didn’t rush to defend herself. Instead, she turned and walked into the kitchen to start making some coffee.</p><p>“Agatha, have you completely lost your mind?”</p><p>“Claire, please,” she grumbled, the slight hangover from the wine along with the surprise visit was quickly forming into a headache.</p><p>As Agatha busied herself at the counter, her hands moving mechanically as she reached for the coffee, she could feel Claire’s gaze burning into her back. The tension in the room thickened, and she knew this conversation was inevitable, though she hadn’t expected it to come so soon. She let out a slow breath, trying to center herself, but Claire’s voice came again, sharp and insistent.</p><p>“Seriously, Agatha. What the hell is going on here?”</p><p>“It’s not what it looks—”</p><p>“Don’t give me that, Agatha. I know you fancy yourself the smart one but I’m not stupid. Don’t try to tell me that I didn’t see what I definitely just saw. It’s been what, a month?” She wasn’t even trying to hide the judgemental edge from her tone.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes for a moment, massaging her temples. “Can we not do this today, Claire? I’ve got enough going on.” The frustration in her voice was clear now, the headache growing with every word exchanged. She wasn’t sure why she always managed to push her buttons so easily, but it felt just like every conversation they’d had recently. A battle.</p><p>Claire’s steps echoed behind her as she walked into the kitchen, still not letting up. “You think I’m just going to stand by and watch you continue to self-destruct?” Her voice was cold, but there was something else in it too—something close to hurt. “You’ve been out of this marriage for a month? And this? This is what you come up with?”</p><p>Agatha’s grip tightened on the coffee pot. She turned around slowly, facing Claire for the first time since she’d walked in. “I’m not the one who walked away, Claire. Remember?” Her voice had an edge now, the sting of old wounds resurfacing.</p><p>Claire's jaw clenched, but she didn’t back down. “Don’t do that. Don’t try to make me the villain in this. You think I wanted things to fall apart?” She was speaking faster now, words tumbling out like she couldn’t keep them inside any longer. “You think I wanted to leave you behind? But you were so damn wrapped up in yourself and your career—do you even <em> know </em> how it felt to watch you ignore me, to be invisible in our own life?”</p><p>Agatha’s heart tightened at the accusation, and she opened her mouth to argue, but the words didn’t come. Instead, all that came was a raw, hollow feeling she hadn’t allowed herself to acknowledge before. They had been so much to each other, once. And she had failed—failed in a way that still gnawed at her every time Claire was around.</p><p>“You’re not the only one who hurt, Claire,” Agatha finally said, her voice softer now, the anger slowly ebbing into exhaustion. “I did my best, but you didn’t see me. You didn’t see what I was trying to do.” She shook her head, fighting the sting behind her eyes. “I thought if I worked harder, if I made enough money—”</p><p>“You thought that would fix everything,” Claire interrupted, shaking her head bitterly. “But it didn’t, Agatha. You didn’t even see me when I was standing right in front of you.”</p><p>The silence hung between them, thick and suffocating. Agatha’s mind raced. She had never fully processed the damage they’d done to each other, the years of bitterness and neglect that had piled up, until now. </p><p>Claire seemed to sense the shift, though, and her expression softened, just a fraction. She sighed, her arms dropping from their defensive crossed position. “I just don’t get it,” she said quietly. “I don’t get—whatever this is with her. You’re… you’re not that kind of person.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrowed at the implication, her voice suddenly sharp. “And what exactly do you mean by that? What, because I’m with someone younger, suddenly I’m not ‘me’ anymore?”</p><p>“No,” Claire responded quickly, shaking her head. “I just don’t want you to make the same mistakes. I don’t want you to lose yourself again. I just—I don’t know why this feels like a reaction to everything that’s happened.”</p><p>Agatha took a step back, her hands tightening around the edge of the counter. “You don’t get to tell me how I’m supposed to live my life,” she said, her voice low but firm. “I don’t owe you explanations, Claire. You made your choice. Now I’m making mine.” </p><p>The words felt harsh even as she said them, but they were the truth. She had spent so long holding onto the past, trying to fix something that couldn’t be fixed, but not anymore.</p><p>Claire stood there for a long moment, her face unreadable. Finally, she let out a slow breath, her shoulders sagging with resignation. “I just don’t want to see you getting hurt,” she repeated, this time quieter.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze softened just a touch, but she didn’t say anything. Instead, she turned away, her focus drifting back to the coffee brewing in the machine. “Yeah well, I’m already hurt,” she said bitterly. “And it really isn’t any of your business. You left because you were tired of tying yourself into knots to try and make me happy. That’s not your responsibility anymore.</p><p>The silence that followed was heavy and long. Finally, Claire spoke again, her voice softer. “You’re right. It’s not. I just came by to drop off some of your clothes I found mixed in with my things.”</p><p>“Thanks. You can leave them at the door,” Agatha murmured before adding sharply, “and your key.”</p><p>“Right. I’m sorry. I should’ve waited for you to answer instead of letting myself in. It’s not my house anymore.” She took the key off her keyring and placed it on the counter.</p><p>With that, she turned to leave, pausing at the door. “Good luck with everything,” she added, and without another word, she left. </p><p>Agatha stood there, watching the door close behind her, the silence of the house pressing in on her. Her fingers gripped the edge of the counter, but she couldn’t shake the feeling that Claire’s words had lodged themselves deep inside her, like a splinter that wouldn’t come out. </p><p>She thought about what Claire had said—about how a fling with wasn’t going to help her heal. Agatha had tried so hard to convince herself that she wasn’t looking for anything serious, that this was just a temporary distraction, a break from the weight of everything. But deep down, she wasn’t so sure anymore.</p><p>Her mind wandered back to Rio—her easy smile, the way she’d looked at Agatha last night, the way she made her feel seen in a way that Agatha hadn’t felt in years. But maybe that was part of the problem. Maybe Rio wasn’t <em> the </em> solution. Maybe she’d been just a little too convenient. Agatha had spent so long avoiding emotional connections, keeping people at arm's length, that she wasn’t sure she even knew how to navigate this. </p><p>She paced around the kitchen, still feeling the aftershocks of the conversation with her ex. Had last night been a mistake? Had she actually lost her mind? Would the awkward run in with her ex scare Rio off and break the ease of their moments together?</p><p>As the hours ticked by, Agatha found herself getting restless, trapped in her own thoughts, unable to shake off the sense of unease. She looked at the clock on the wall, the weight of the evening creeping into her bones. </p><p>She grabbed her jacket and called a cab</p><hr/><p>The bar was loud and buzzing with the kind of energy that felt so far removed from the suffocating quiet of her house. Agatha walked in, scanning the room for a distraction. She wasn’t looking for anything serious tonight. Just something to take her mind off the doubts swirling inside her head.</p><p>She walked up to the bar and ordered a top shelf whiskey, her fingers tapping impatiently against the counter as she waited. The glass was cold and smooth in her hand when the bartender slid it over to her. She took a long sip, feeling the burn of the alcohol as it slid down her throat, hoping it would dull the discomfort gnawing at her.</p><p>The bar was crowded, filled with people laughing, talking, music playing in the background. For a brief moment, Agatha felt detached from it all. She didn’t belong here, or maybe she just didn’t know how to connect with anyone anymore. Her ex’s voice echoed in her mind, accusing her of making the same mistakes. <em> This </em> wasn’t going to heal her. Was she just doing it all wrong?</p><p>Agatha glanced around, looking for someone—anyone—to distract her, and for the first time in a while, she felt the pull to just be someone else. Someone who wasn’t carrying the weight of a failed marriage. Someone who didn’t feel a weird guilt about a one time misguided hookup. She needed to forget about both women, forget about all the complications, and find someone else to take her mind off things, if only for tonight.</p><p>She spotted a woman at the far end of the bar, about her age, with dark hair and confident posture. She wasn’t <em> exactly </em> Agatha’s type, but she was someone who could be a brief escape. Someone who wouldn’t ask about her past or question her decisions. Someone appropriate.</p><p>Agatha felt herself getting up, her legs moving of their own accord as her mind raced with a mixture of hesitation and resolve. </p><p>But as she took a step forward, she stopped. Her breath caught in her throat as the door to the bar opened, and she saw someone else standing there walking in. Rio.</p><p>Agatha froze, her heart skipping a beat. </p><p>What the hell was Rio doing here?</p><p>Rio’s eyes scanned the room before landing on Agatha, a flicker of recognition passing through her expression. She took a step forward, and Agatha could feel her own pulse quicken.</p><p>It was impossible to ignore the way her presence filled the space, drawing Agatha’s attention back to her without needing a single word. Suddenly, the thought of finding someone else, of escaping her own doubts, felt foolish.</p><p>Rio walked toward her, a knowing smile tugging at her lips as she closed the distance between them. Agatha stood frozen, clinging to her glass to have something to ground her.</p><p>"Fancy seeing you here," Rio said, her voice teasing but soft.</p><p>Agatha let out a breath she didn’t realize she’d been holding, her shoulders relaxing just slightly. "I could ask you the same thing," she said, her voice coming out a little hoarse. She forced a smile, though the tightness in her chest didn’t quite ease.</p><p>Rio shrugged. "Meeting some friends. But I’m always early, and they’re always late."</p><p>Agatha’s gaze flickered away for a moment, the weight of her doubts creeping back. The thought of leaving, of finding someone else, started to feel ridiculous. What was she doing? She wasn’t going to fix anything by pushing people away.</p><p>Rio was right there, standing in front of her, close enough that Agatha could feel the heat of her body. Without thinking, she reached out, her fingers brushing against Rio’s hand.</p><p>“Well, since you’re here. Do you want to talk about this morning?”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, her lips curling into a playful smirk. “If you want to. But really, it's none of my business. I’m happy to pretend the awkwardness never happened if you are.” She slid onto the barstool next to Agatha with an exaggerated sigh. “I mean, who wants to talk about regrets when there’s whiskey to be had?”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, though there was a flicker of amusement behind them. “You’re not exactly making it easier to stay serious, you know.”</p><p>“Hey, I’m just trying to make sure you don’t overthink things,” Rio said, leaning in a little closer, her voice dropping to a more intimate level. “You had a good time last night, didn’t you?”</p><p>Agatha froze for a beat, the question landing in her chest. She nodded, a smile pulling at her lips despite herself. “Yeah,” she said, her voice quieter than intended. “I did.”</p><p>“Then what’s the problem?” Rio asked, her eyes glinting with mischief. “You’re allowed to have fun, Agatha. It’s not like you’re signing a lifetime contract here.”</p><p>Agatha bit back a laugh. “I wasn’t exactly thinking about that.” She gave Rio a sideways glance. “More like... what happens next.”</p><p>“Well,” Rio said, her smile turning a little more knowing, “next is more fun. I’m always down for more fun. But if you’re gonna get all serious on me again, I can always find someone else to laugh with.” She gave Agatha a playful shove on the shoulder.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, her confidence returning in spite of herself. “You think you can just walk in here, say a few words, and everything will be fine?”</p><p>“Pretty much,” Rio said with a mock-innocent shrug. “Works every time.”</p><p>“Yeah, well, it’s not <em> that </em> easy,” Agatha replied, her voice taking on a teasing edge as she leaned back. “You think I’m just going to throw all my doubts away because you showed up?”</p><p>Rio smiled. “I’m hoping that’s exactly what happens.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched into a reluctant grin as she leaned in just a little, giving Rio a playfully challenging look. “You’re really full of yourself, aren’t you?”</p><p>“Confidence is attractive,” Rio teased back, her voice smooth and light. “And you <em> are </em> attracted, so clearly something’s working.”</p><p>Agatha snorted, feeling her earlier reservations slip further away. “You know I had so much fun last night I forgot how annoying you are.”</p><p>“Hey, I’m just being honest,” Rio said, her voice low and teasing. “But if you’re still worried, we can keep this as casual as you like. No pressure, just... fun.”</p><p>Agatha took a moment to look at Rio, the way her eyes sparkled with a mix of mischief and sincerity, and a warm laugh bubbled up from her chest. “You’re something else, you know that?”</p><p>Rio leaned in, her voice dropping to a soft, teasing whisper. “You still haven’t told me if you regret last night.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, but before she could answer, Rio kissed her lightly on the cheek. It was a quick, teasing gesture, but it left her breathless for a moment, her heart picking up speed in her chest.</p><p>Agatha shook her head with a small, incredulous laugh. “Okay, okay. I don’t regret it. Are you happy now?”</p><p>“Much happier,” Rio replied, her grin wide and playful. “See? I knew you’d come around.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, a fond smile tugging at her lips. “Yeah, yeah. Don’t let me keep you from your friends. Go have fun. I’m heading home.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, her grin mischievous. “Let me come with you. I’ve got no problem ditching them.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, amused. “No, no. You should stay and have fun. Don’t let me be the reason you waste your night.”</p><p>She turned to slip off the barstool, but Rio’s hand shot out, catching her wrist.</p><p>“Seriously,” Rio said, her voice softening but still playful. “They’ll be fine. They’d probably be pissed at me if they saw you walk out and I chose to stick around with them.” </p><p>Agatha paused, her gaze meeting Rio’s, a mix of amusement and something else flickering in her eyes.</p><p>“If you sure,” she finally said hesitantly.</p><p>“Of course I am beautiful, let’s get out of here.” Rio hopped off the barstool and wrapped her arm around Agatha.</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, smirking at the confident way Rio spoke. "Beautiful, huh?" she teased, but there was a warmth in her tone that softened the words. She let Rio lead her out of the bar, the door swinging closed behind them.</p><p>As they stepped into the cool night air, they spotted Rio’s friends gathered near a group of motorcycles, laughing loudly and exchanging playful banter. They caught sight of Rio first, and immediately began calling out to her with grins and exaggerated waves.</p><p>"Hey, Vidal, leaving us already?" one of them shouted, winking dramatically.</p><p>"Do we get to meet your new friend, Rio?" another chimed in, nudging Rio’s arm playfully.</p><p>Rio just laughed, her eyes twinkling as she shrugged. "Maybe. Depends on how well you all behave."</p><p>Agatha watched Rio with a curious glance, noticing how Rio seemed proud to introduce her to the group, a subtle but clear sense of ownership in the way she stood just a little taller, her smile just a little brighter as she glanced at Agatha. </p><p>"Don’t worry," Rio said to them with a mischievous grin, "She’s way cooler than any of you anyway."</p><p>The group erupted into good-natured laughter, but no one tried to convince Rio to stay. After all, they all knew better than to argue when she was set on something. One of the friends raised a hand in mock salute. "Alright, alright, you kids have fun. We'll see you around."</p><p>"Yeah, yeah, you all be good," Rio teased back before turning to Agatha. She gave her a quick, satisfied look, as if to say, <em> See? They don’t mind. </em></p><p>With a final wave, they headed toward the car. As Rio unlocked it, she gave Agatha a playful nudge. "See, they didn’t care, rowdy but harmless."</p><p>As they drove back to Agatha’s place, the tension from earlier seemed to fade away with every mile. Agatha looked over at Rio, her lips curling into a soft smile. "I’m glad I ran into you tonight."</p><p>Rio gave her a quick, sideways glance before returning her eyes to the road. “Good. Me too. And remember, don’t get stuck in your head. We can keep this casual.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and smiled as Rio began to hum along to the radio. She could do casual.</p>

<p>
<span>As soon as the car was parked in the driveway, Rio leaned across the console, tangling her hand in Agatha’s hair and pulling her into a hungry and demanding kiss. It immediately promised more and Agatha grabbed her face pulling her closer to her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How long have you been waiting to do that,” she murmured against her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Since outside the bar when I saw your ass in that skirt. But I figured you didn’t want to give my friends a free show.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled and kissed her again. As Rio’s hand drifted to her shirt and reached for a button, she caught her wrist and broke away from their kiss to grin at her teasingly. “Nice try, hot shot. I’m too old to settle for getting felt up in your truck.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pouted for a moment but Agatha shook her head firmly. “No. Not here. Get your ass inside.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The pout turned into a grin as Rio nodded eagerly. “Yes ma’am.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They crashed through the front door and Agatha dropped her keys and bag to the floor carelessly before turning to shove Rio against the door. She grabbed her face as she kissed her, humming eagerly as her lover’s hands fell to grip her ass pulling her close.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How the fuck did you get this skirt on,” Rio growled, biting harshly under her jaw. “God, your legs always look so good, but in this? You’re making me crazy.” She pulled back and arched and eyebrow at her. “You were planning on getting laid tonight weren’t you?” Rio smiled and put a hand over her heart in mock offense, “And you didn’t call?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shut up.” Agatha shot back, pulling her into another kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They kissed their way through the hall, and Agatha was relieved that there were no photos left to be knocked off the walls as they collided against them. They stumbled into the kitchen and in an instant, with a surprising show of strength, Rio lifted her onto the marble countertop.</span>
</p><p>
<span>From this position, Agatha had to tilt her head more to reach her but she didn’t mind. Their lips collided again, rough and biting. She wrapped her legs around Rio’s waist, kicking off the heels she had worn as she did so. Rio’s hands were back at her shirt, fumbling at the buttons. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is this silk,” she murmured against her neck, “if it’s expensive tell me and I won’t rip it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is. But I don’t care,” Agatha growled, leaning her head back for a second as she gasped, “get it off.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t need any further permission and took the shirt in both hands, pulling hard enough to send several buttons clattering across the tile. “Oh, this is </span>
<em>
<span>definitely</span>
</em>
<span> expensive.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced down and noticed that Rio was staring, practically drooling at the black lace bra she had worn. The hungry, desperate look in the woman’s eyes shot through her and she felt a surge of confidence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A slow grin spread across Agatha's face as she took in the look. She reached down, her fingers brushing against the fabric of Rio's shirt, then tugging her closer.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It is. Do you like it?” she teased, her voice low and challenging, a spark of mischief in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded eagerly. “Fuck yes—thought I was ready for anything, but you keep surprising me,” she murmured, her voice rough as her fingers traced along Agatha's sides, lingering over the lace with an almost reverent touch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s laughter was soft, thrilled by the control she seemed to have over Rio at that moment. She tilted her head, lips brushing just along Rio’s jawline before she whispered, “I think I’m wearing something else you’ll like. Want to see?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please,” Rio gasped, her hands already moving to push at the hem of Agatha’s skirt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah ah, patience.” Agatha scolded, placing a firm hand on Rio’s chest and pushing her back a step. Rio obliged, taking a step back but Agatha noticed how her fingers twitched impatiently at her sides.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Smirking, Agatha slowly crossed her legs, revealing the thigh highs that she’d worn.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio choked, frozen in place as she stared hungrily. “You look…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, “You don’t have to tell me, honey. I know.” She spread her legs and beckoned Rio back closer. The woman immediately stepped forward placing her hands on her revealed thighs, her fingertips curling around the top of the stockings.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave Rio a sly smile, clearly relishing the effect she had on her. She leaned in close, just enough to let her breath brush Rio’s ear. “Now, why don’t you follow me upstairs?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t wait for a reply, just slipped off the counter and began a slow, deliberate walk toward the staircase. She could practically feel Rio’s gaze on her, the intensity of it making her pulse race. The sound of Rio’s footsteps following close behind was all the answer she needed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Making out in the hallway had been fun, but the anticipation of this, the knowledge that she had rendered the young woman into a helpless mess who just stumbled behind her was even better.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they reached the top of the stairs, Agatha paused, turning just enough to look back at Rio, who was watching her with barely-contained excitement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you coming?” Agatha asked, her tone light but challenging.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, stepping closer until they were nearly toe-to-toe. “Wherever you lead,” she said softly, her eyes gleaming.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good girl,” she said softly, trailing a finger under her chin before stepping into her room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio followed eagerly, closing the door behind them before leaning against it to catch her breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moved to sit primly at the side of the bed, crossing her legs again purposefully flashing her thigh.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They both stared at each other for a moment, not sure who would make the next move.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head, smirking slightly as she watched Rio, who was still leaning against the door, trying to pull herself together. There was a spark in Agatha’s eyes, a playful challenge as she looked Rio up and down. She could tell Rio was waiting for a signal, some invitation to come closer. She licked her lips and let her gaze drag over her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well? Are you just going to stand there, or are you planning on joining me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t need to be told twice. She crossed the room quickly, only stopping when Agatha held up a finger to stop her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Kneel,” Agatha said firmly, her voice cool and commanding and leaving no room for negotiation. Rio eagerly complied, falling to her knees in front of her. She looked up at Agatha eagerly, leaning forward for just a moment to press a kiss to her knee then one to the hem of her stocking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned forward, spreading her legs slightly and running a finger down Rio’s jaw. “You really don’t mind waiting, do you?” she murmured with a teasing smile. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed softly, “Not if this is the reward.” Agatha chuckled, both amused and pleased with Rio’s response, and placed both hands on the bed behind her leaning back slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good answer. I like you like this. I didn’t know you had it in you to be so patient.” Agatha shot her a conspiratory smile. “I think you deserve a reward.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio licked her lips and nodded quickly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Take them off,” Agatha husked, extending one leg towards Rio, pressing her foot against her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Needing no further instruction Rio quickly rolled the thigh highs off her, kissing down her leg as she went. Her hands roamed up and down her legs, as she looked back to Agatha awaiting her next instruction.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes flashed, she was a little mad with power. But for once in her life power wasn’t the most important thing here. Getting Rio’s hands on her was a much more immediate need. She stood up from the bed, passing her hand through Rio’s hair as she did so.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Be a dear and unzip me?” She turned around facing away from the girl, smirking as she heard her breath catch. Rio’s hands pulled down the zipper and moved the skirt down to pool around her feet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck,” she heard Rio rasp. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But before she could reply with another teasing comment, it was her turn to be caught off guard as she felt teeth scrape against the curve of her ass. Agatha let out an unholy moan as she fell forward, catching herself with her hands as she leaned over the bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh you </span>
<em>
<span>liked</span>
</em>
<span> that.” Rio purred, her confidence returning as she pulled her underwear down. She gently sank her teeth into Agatha’s ass again before rising to her feet. Agatha felt a hand gently press at the center of her back, not forcing her or trying to control her, more like a question.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled as she allowed herself to be bent over the bed. Rio’s hands moved to firmly squeeze her hips as she leaned forward to kiss her shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now can I tell you how good you look?” She asked in a teasing whisper, letting her lips ghost over the shell of Agatha’s ear.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded against the bed, pushing her hips back against her. “Keep touching me like this and you can tell me whatever you want.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s soft laugh sent a wave of warm breath over her ear and Agatha trembled, curling her fists in her expensive sheets. She felt the weight of Rio on top of her leave and she whined at the loss of contact. But that whine was quickly replaced by an obscene moan as she felt Rio knock her legs further apart and dart her tongue teasingly at her clit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck, Rio!” She whined, lifting her hips more as she raised herself onto her tiptoes. Rio licked a long stripe from her clit up to her center, letting her tongue dip inside her for a moment. Her tongue teased dangerously higher for a moment before Agatha reached behind herself to push her head away. She rolled and sat up in the bed, grabbing Rio’s shirt and hauling her into her a needy kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Need you inside me. Right fucking now.” She growled, desperately grabbing Rio’s hand and pulling it between her thighs. The woman eagerly complied, crawling on top of Agatha and pushing her onto the bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love how bossy you get.” Rio teased quickly shedding her own clothes and removing Agatha’s bra. As soon as they were both completely naked she wasted no time in pressing one then two fingers inside her. Not enough though, just teasing at her entrance. “Tell me what you want.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my God, Rio I don’t fucking care just fuck me.” Agatha groaned, grabbing her wrist to try and force her fingers deeper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked but complied, sinking her fingers inside her. It felt like her whole body came off the bed to meet them. Agatha’s hips jumped in fits and starts with each steady thrust and curl of Rio’s fingers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t control the desperate needy noises leaving her and she grasped for a pillow, pulling it to cover her face and muffle the sounds. Just as quickly Rio ripped it away, “No way! I want to see you. And hear you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded blindly knowing that at this moment she’d give her anything she wanted. In reward, Rio pressed a third finger inside her. The stretch was just on the edge of too much but as Rio’s thumb fell to her clit and began to circle over it, Agatha found herself pulling the woman even closer as she clenched around her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she came it was with a deep and feral moan, and with her nails scratching down Rio’s back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Based on Rio’s growl she didn’t seem to mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha whined as Rio removed her fingers but before she could protest they were replaced by her mouth again. It was exceedingly gentle and tender, as she pressed small kisses against her where her body still fluttered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t take any more. She </span>
<em>
<span>had</span>
</em>
<span> to have more. She whimpered and tangled her hand in Rio’s hair unsure whether she wanted to pull her closer or push her away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Babe, please,” she whimpered, the endearment falling from her before she could second-guess herself. She felt Rio smile against her and that alone silenced any concerns she had.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio placed one more gentle kiss against her clit before finally moving her head away. She kissed a meandering path up Agatha’s body stopping to spend several minutes kissing and nipping gently over her breasts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s full body was flushed, and her breath came in heavy gasps. Every movement seemed to take a monumental amount of effort, but eventually, she forced the strength to reach her hand to Rio’s face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lifted her head to look up at her, letting her nipple slip from her mouth with a soft pop. “Yes?” She questioned softly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come here,” Agatha whispered, her voice cracking slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled fondly and pressed one last kiss to her breast before rolling to the side and moving to lay her head next to Agatha’s on the pillows. She immediately tangled their legs together, one arm wrapping over her midsection as she scooted closer to her, the other slipping under Agatha’s head and curling around to play with her hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed with contentment, leaning in to press her face into Rio’s neck. “You’re gonna have to give me a minute,” she murmured against her throat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t mind,” Rio replied softly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let her fingers trace gentle circles along Agatha’s shoulder, her hand light and soothing. She settled in, adjusting to make sure Agatha was as comfortable as possible. The quiet felt warm, like the soft blanket they were wrapped up in together. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a slow breath, feeling her pulse gradually settle as she pressed closer. For a moment, she let her eyes drift shut, just taking in the steady rhythm of Rio’s breathing and the faint scent of her lingering perfume. It had been a long time since she’d felt this content, this...at ease with someone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Rio murmured after a moment, her tone playful, “is this the part where we exchange deep secrets or do you want to just keep lying here and pretending the rest of the world doesn’t exist?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled, her hand slipping up to rest on Rio’s shoulder “You might be waiting awhile before my brain can form sentences again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, don’t rush on my account,” Rio replied, smirking. “I’m good with this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t help but smile. “Me too.” She paused, tracing her thumb over Rio’s hand. “You know...I wasn’t really looking for this. Thought maybe it was too late for me to find something like this again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head, meeting Agatha’s gaze with a softness that caught her off guard. “Funny thing about life,” she murmured, “it likes to surprise you when you least expect it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, nuzzling closer to Rio. “Is this still casual?” She asked, wincing a bit at how fragile her voice sounded.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio just smoothly replied, “It can be whatever you want it to be, babe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, a soft, contented sound as her eyes fluttered shut. She mumbled something almost incoherent, her voice trailing off. “I want… want to take care of you too…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pressed a gentle kiss to the top of her head, smoothing a hand over her hair. “Shh, there’s time for that later,” she murmured, her voice a soothing whisper. “Right now, I’m just happy to hold you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, the tension slipping from her shoulders as she nestled closer, quickly falling asleep in Rio’s arms.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>Nothing about this felt casual.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Not when she woke up to gentle kisses being peppered against her back. Not when she had Rio’s voice whispering a soft good morning in her ear, her hair tickling her cheek. She tried to roll over to face her but Rio clicked her tongue softly and she could feel her shake her head against her as her arms wrapped more tightly around her and she could feel her chest flush against her back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Casual wasn’t having the best night's sleep you had in years wrapped in the arms of your much younger lover. Casual wasn’t the way that Rio’s hands slowly slipped down her front, movement sluggish with sleep as she reached to cup between her legs rocking her palm against her clit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going to go make some coffee.” Agatha yawned, trying to roll away but Rio’s hands held her firmly in place.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t want coffee. Want you,” she mumbled against her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart skipped at Rio's sleepy confession, feeling the warmth of Rio’s breath against her shoulder. She swallowed, her resolve weakening as Rio’s hands tightened around her waist, holding her close. Clever finger parted her, teasing featherlight touches around her clit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re relentless,” she murmured, trying and failing to keep a teasing edge to her tone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled softly, nuzzling into the curve of her neck. “I can stop if you really want me to…” Her other hand traced gentle circles along Agatha’s stomach, a slow, soothing motion that made leaving the bed feel impossible.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let herself sink back into Rio’s embrace, sighing, “You’re trouble.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good trouble, I hope,” Rio replied, her tone light and playful, but there was a softness in her touch, a warmth that seemed to chase away every doubt lingering in Agatha’s mind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She smiled, her voice barely a whisper. “The best kind.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>This quiet intimacy definitely wasn’t casual. But right now, still half asleep, she couldn’t force herself to care.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We should take a shower,” Agatha murmured, unable to put any force behind her words or pull herself from her lover’s hold.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hummed in response, her lips grazing Agatha’s shoulder as she let her fingers drift lazily inside her. She curled them gently and Agatha couldn’t help how her hips twitched in response. Even though her mind was still foggy with sleep, her body was waking up. “Hmm… A shower, huh? Are you sure that’s what you want?” Rio teased, her voice barely above a murmur.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shivered at the feel of Rio’s fingers moving gently inside her. “I thought I was sure,” she replied, her words soft and almost drowsy, “but you’re making it very hard to get up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” Rio whispered a smile in her voice. “Because I’m not done with you just yet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a soft laugh, the kind that surprised even herself. She felt Rio smile against her skin, and for a moment, everything else felt irrelevant.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine,” she huffed, no real annoyance in her voice. “But let me roll over then, I want to see you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pressed one more kiss to her shoulder before removing her fingers and allowing Agatha to roll to face her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha finally managed to roll to her side, she was struck by the sight before her. Rio, usually so self-assured and effortlessly composed, lay there with her hair tousled and messy, strands falling across her face in a wild way. Her cheeks were faintly flushed from sleep, and her half-lidded eyes held a soft, almost shy warmth as she met Agatha's gaze.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In this gentle morning light, she looked so soft and vulnerable. Her sleepy smile was slow, the kind that crept up lazily and lingered in the corners of her mouth. A faint line marked her cheek where it had pressed against the pillow, and the sight of it tugged at Agatha’s heart in a way she wasn’t prepared for. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d expected to wake up feeling the familiar thrill of attraction, but instead, she felt something deeper, something that left her breathless. For once, it wasn’t just the pull of desire—it was affection, tender and grounding, and it made her want to reach out, to pull Rio close and keep her there. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She let her fingers drift to Rio's face, brushing a stray lock of hair back, and Rio’s sleepy gaze softened even more as she leaned into Agatha's touch. “Hey,” she whispered softly, leaning forward to kiss her gently.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned into the kiss, tracing her fingers over Rio’s jaw. She pulled away after a moment, scrunching her nose as she felt how dry her mouth was. “Let me at least go brush my teeth. I </span>
<em>
<span>know</span>
</em>
<span> I have morning breath.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t care,” Rio mumbled, already leaning forward to try and kiss her again, but Agatha shook her head, pressing a kiss to her forehead instead.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I care.” She untangled herself from the woman, who pouted but didn’t try to stop her again as Agatha rolled out of bed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the bathroom, Agatha took a steadying breath, letting herself settle into the quiet as she brushed her teeth. She glanced at her reflection, blinking at the disheveled woman staring back. Her hair was a mess, her eyes still softened from sleep—and she looked unmistakably…happy. The thought made her pause, her hand stilling as she ran her tongue over her teeth, almost as if studying this unfamiliar side of herself.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She splashed cool water on her face, hoping the sharp chill would wake her up, would keep her from spiraling into what this all meant. She’d wanted easy, something fleeting, hadn’t she? The word casual seemed at this point to be a mockery But the easy warmth of waking up beside Rio, the way it felt like she was meant to be there—it was more than she’d bargained for.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Before her thoughts could tumble any further, she caught sight of Rio in the mirror. Rio had slipped into the doorway, leaning casually against the frame, watching her with that same soft smile that made Agatha’s heart skip. Her gaze was warm, her hair still a mess, and her eyes held a playfulness that seemed to catch every bit of light in the room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Morning, gorgeous,” Rio murmured, her voice low and affectionate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed out a laugh, turning to face her but feeling suddenly shy under the weight of Rio's gaze. “You really don’t have to watch me brush my teeth, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stepped closer, wrapping her arms around Agatha from behind, her chin resting comfortably on her shoulder. “Can’t help it,” she said softly, pressing a gentle kiss to Agatha’s shoulder. “Kinda like seeing you like this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smile softened as she caught Rio’s eyes in the mirror again, feeling that same warmth settle over her. “Yeah,” she whispered, barely able to meet her own reflection. “I think…I kinda like it, too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you have an extra toothbrush? I realized that you were probably very nicely hinting that I had morning breath too,” Rio teased, smiling playfully at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed and handed one from the medicine cabinet to her. “I </span>
<em>
<span>wasn’t</span>
</em>
<span> going to say anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned as she took the toothbrush, leaning over the sink beside Agatha and quickly brushing her teeth. They shared a few playful glances in the mirror, and Agatha couldn’t help but feel a strange sense of domesticity settle over them. Here they were, standing side by side in the morning light, brushing their teeth like they’d done this a hundred times before. It felt…comfortable, in a way she hadn’t expected.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finishing up, Rio gave a dramatic little breath test with a mischievous grin. “Better?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled, rolling her eyes. “Much better.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned in close, her voice dropping to a murmur. “Good, because I wasn’t finished kissing you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She closed the small distance between them, and Agatha felt herself melt into the kiss, her hands slipping up to cradle Rio’s face. It was slower, softer than last night—like they were savoring the quiet moments left between them before the rest of the day began.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finally pulled back, Rio brushed a thumb along Agatha’s cheek. “So, what does a morning-after look like for you? Breakfast? A hasty goodbye? I don’t want to step on any toes here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a breath, feeling a flicker of nerves mixed with the warmth that lingered. “Breakfast sounds…nice,” she said, surprised by her own words. Normally, she’d have had an easy exit planned, but this time, she found she didn’t want to leave.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smile widened. “Breakfast it is, then.” She took Agatha’s hand, giving it a gentle squeeze. “But only if you let me cook. It’s one of </span>
<em>
<span>many</span>
</em>
<span> valuable skills.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I’ll hold you to that,” Agatha teased, but there was a softness in her voice, a hint of something genuine that she still wasn’t ready to acknowledge just yet. “But let me get a shower first, I haven’t fully woken up yet.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave her hand a light tug smiling mischievously. “Want some company?” She glanced over at the large double shower her smirk widening. “Seems like you’ve got room for two.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes before trying to work her face into a more serious expression, “I prefer to shower alone.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, but,” she drawled undeterred, “I think it would </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> start your morning off right if I went down on you in the shower.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha flushed immediately as she considered the offer. “You drive a hard bargain,” she sighed dramatically before grabbing her hand and tugging her into the shower with her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The water was hot and quickly washed away any remaining sleepiness from her. Or maybe she was woken up by the feeling of Rio pulling her closer under the spray. Goosebumps prickled all over her body despite the hot water temperature.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kissed her slowly, pressing her body closer and nudging her backward. Agatha gasped as her back hit the cold tile.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry,” Rio apologized half-heartedly, ducking her head and taking one her her nipples into her mouth. Agatha moans softly instantly forgiving her. Rio kissed her way down to her stomach as she moved to her knees. She bit gently at the crease of her thigh, Agatha was so soft here. Rio wanted to stay here forever, she was positive that Agatha had some fancy water heater that would keep them both warm for at least an hour, but it was hard to continue to tease when all she wanted was to bury her tongue inside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She moved her hand to lift Agatha’s leg over her shoulder, ignoring her grumble, “If I slip and break a hip I’ll never forgive you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve got you. Rest your weight on me. I’m not going to let you fall.” Rio squeezed her calf, the muscle here was so firm compared to her soft thighs. She leaned in, dragging her tongue against Agatha, smiling as she felt her hips buck against her mouth and a hand fall to tangle in her hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love this,” Rio husked against her, pressing her face more eagerly against her. As she dipped her tongue inside, her nose bumping against her clit, Agatha let out a loud moan that seemed to be amplified as it echoed off the shower walls. It makes her crazy. She wants Agatha just like this, messy, lost in pleasure, spread completely open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That's it baby,” Rio said, her words muffled against her, unwilling to pull her mouth away for even a moment to speak more clearly. “You taste so good. You’re fucking perfect.”</span>
<span>Agatha leaned her head back against the shower wall, spreading her legs wider as she allowed her hips to roll against Rio’s eager tongue. She moved desperately, whimpering as if she couldn’t get enough from the woman beneath her. Privately Rio agreed, she couldn’t get enough from her either.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fingers too? Or just my mouth?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, Rio, please.” Agatha groaned, reaching blindly for her hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha came, Rio’s face was soaked with more than the spray of the shower. Rio saw the moment just before Agatha’s legs give out and caught her, supporting her as Agatha tried desperately to catch her breath bracing her hands on her shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She carefully eased up, still supporting Agatha. “Still prefer showering alone?” She teased, kissing her playfully, nipping her lip as she pulled away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a breathless laugh. “You make a good case. I may need to gather more evidenceー” Rio raised her eyebrows playfully and her hand slid to Agatha’s breast against before she laughed and pulled it away. “I didn’t mean </span>
<em>
<span>now</span>
</em>
<span>. Scoot. I need to wash my hair. And I remember you promising me breakfast.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pouted for just a moment before kissing her once more. “Alright, alright, let me see what I can do.” </span><br/>

<p>The sun was warm, the pool water sparkling just a few feet away as Agatha lounged, letting the quietness of the afternoon settle around her. She was half-dozing, her mind wandering, when she heard the familiar sound of Rio’s footsteps approaching. A small smile tugged at her lips as she opened one eye and found Rio standing by her chair, hands on her hips and a teasing grin already on her face.</p><p>“Enjoying yourself?” Rio drawled, her voice full of that infuriating charm.</p><p>“I was,” Agatha replied, raising an eyebrow. “Until someone decided to interrupt my peace.”</p><p>“Oh, don’t mind me,” Rio said, flopping into the chair next to Agatha’s with exaggerated nonchalance. She stretched out, clearly getting comfortable, though her eyes were fixed on Agatha with an unmistakable gleam. “I can sit here quietly. Won’t bother you at all.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a long, dry look, but Rio only smirked, stretching with a little hum. After a moment, Agatha shifted, adjusting her swimsuit and glancing at Rio from the corner of her eye. “You just gonna sit there and stare at me, or…?”</p><p>“Oh, I don’t know.” Rio leaned back, tapping her chin thoughtfully, her gaze drifting up and down Agatha with a deliberately slow once-over. “Might take my time…really soak it all in. Don’t want to rush anything, right?”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, feeling her patience start to fray. She had expected Rio to come over, say something witty, maybe kiss her—anything but this smug, drawn-out act. “You’re being annoying, you know that?”</p><p>“Annoying? Me?” Rio gasped, clutching her chest with a mock-wounded expression. “I’m just appreciating the view!”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and looked away, but Rio wasn’t done yet. She leaned closer, nudging Agatha’s arm. “What’s wrong, hon? You look like you’re waiting for something.”</p><p>“You know <em> exactly </em> what I’m waiting for,” Agatha said, trying to keep her voice steady, though her irritation was beginning to bubble over.</p><p>“Do I?” Rio cocked her head, her grin only widening. “Maybe you should spell it out for me. I know you’re not just waiting for me to check the filter.”</p><p>Agatha’s patience snapped. With one swift movement, she shoved Rio hard, tipping her right over the edge of her chair and into the pool with a splash.</p><p>She watched with satisfaction as Rio resurfaced, gasping and sputtering, her smirk finally wiped away. But before Agatha could fully revel in her victory, Rio reached up, her hands catching Agatha’s arm with surprising speed. In one quick yank, Agatha was pulled off balance, and a split second later, she was in the pool, too, the cold water shocking her senses.</p><p>They surfaced together, Agatha splashing hair out of her face and glaring, though she couldn’t quite hide the smile tugging at her lips. “You’re infuriating.”</p><p>Rio just laughed, wiping water from her eyes. “Admit it—you love it.” She swam closer, her eyes gleaming with mischief. “Guess I’ll have to be even more annoying next time, just to see what you’ll do.” </p><p>Agatha splashed her, but there was no real heat behind it. The truth was, she couldn’t stay mad—not with Rio smiling at her like that, her teasing softened by something that felt almost like tenderness.</p><p>Agatha shook her head, flicking water off her fingers in Rio’s direction. “You’re impossible.”</p><p>Rio laughed and darted closer, catching Agatha’s wrist in her hand with a challenging glint in her eyes. “Maybe you just need to learn to keep up,” she teased, tugging Agatha toward her before letting go and swimming a few feet away, just out of reach.</p><p>“Oh, so we’re playing that game, huh?” Agatha narrowed her eyes and lunged, sending a wave of water crashing over both of them as she closed the distance. Rio squealed, slipping out of her grasp only to let Agatha catch her again a second later, the two of them grappling in the water, half-wrestling and half-laughing as they spun around each other.</p><p>“Is that all you got?” Rio taunted, squirming to break free again, her laughter warm and unrestrained.</p><p>Agatha gave her a mock glare. “You’re being a brat, you know that?”</p><p>“Guilty as charged,” Rio shot back, sticking her tongue out. She splashed water at Agatha’s face, her grin never faltering even as Agatha caught her around the waist and tugged her back.</p><p>“Maybe I should find a way to shut you up,” Agatha murmured, her voice low, her grip firm as she pressed Rio back against the edge of the pool.</p><p>Rio’s teasing expression softened as Agatha leaned in, their laughter giving way to the sudden, electricity between them. Agatha’s hands found Rio’s, pinning them gently against the wall as her lips brushed against hers, a slow, deliberate kiss that quickly erased every bit of Rio’s playful defiance. </p><p>Rio’s free hand slid around Agatha’s neck, pulling her closer as she kissed her back with the same, eager intensity.</p><p>When they finally broke apart, Rio looked at her, breathless, a soft smile playing at the corners of her mouth. “You’re full of surprises,” she whispered, her voice barely audible over the soft lapping of the water around them.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help her hungry grin. “Darling, you have no idea.” She pulled off Rio’s shorts under the water before hauling her up onto the edge of the pool, roughly pulling her legs apart to stand between them.</p><p>Agatha leaned in close, her fingers grazing along Rio’s thigh as she stepped between her legs, their faces mere inches apart. Rio’s breath hitched, her playful demeanor replaced with a look of stunned anticipation. Agatha let her hands rest on Rio’s waist, holding her firmly in place as she leaned in, her voice low and teasing. </p><p>“Thought you could get away with all that teasing, hmm?” she murmured, her gaze intense as she studied Rio’s face, clearly enjoying the effect she was having. </p><p>Rio swallowed, her confident smirk faltering just a bit. “Maybe I wanted to see what you’d do about it.”</p><p>Agatha’s laugh was rich, a sound that made Rio shiver. “Careful what you wish for,” she replied, brushing a thumb along Rio’s jawline before pulling her in for a slow, deep kiss, savoring every second as if to remind Rio just who was in charge of the moment.</p><p>When they finally parted, Rio looked at her, completely caught off guard and breathless. “You’re something else,” she whispered, her voice barely above a murmur, hands tightening around Agatha’s shoulders.</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Good. Now, are you going to behave, or should I keep reminding you?” She sank down in the water a little bit, tilting her head to rest it against Rio’s thigh as she smiled coyly up at her.</p><p>“I can be so good,” Rio choked, her hips stuttering slightly as she leaned back out her elbows.</p><p>“I know you can baby,” Agatha breathed before pressing her tongue against her. “Keep being good for me.”</p><hr/><p>As Agatha leaned back on her couch, the reality of her last night of summer freedom washed over her. Tomorrow was Monday, the day she’d finally return to work. Her day had been a haze of final preparations and shifting back into the sharp focus her job demanded. But now, in the quiet evening, there was a tug of melancholy in the knowledge that tomorrow, everything would change. Her easy days spent poolside would soon be replaced by the brisk march of meetings, deadlines, and late nights. And Rio… well, she wasn't sure what would happen with Rio.</p><p>For a moment, she considered just letting this, whatever it was between them, just die off. She’d be busy at the office and with their schedules out of sync, unless she put in an effort there would be no awkward running into each other. Letting the fling slip into memory felt logical, almost natural. But the thought of doing that left a small ache, one that lingered even as she tried to brush it off. </p><p>After a moment of consideration, she picked up her phone, typing out a quick, unguarded message asking Rio to come over. As soon as she hit send, she almost regretted it—she didn’t need to cling to a summer romance. She couldn’t be that desperate.</p><p>But when Rio’s reply came almost instantly—<em> “On my way!” </em>—Agatha felt the flicker of nerves ease into something warmer, something that made her heart skip just a little.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, there was a knock at her door, and she opened it to find Rio grinning, a bag slung over her shoulder, her eyes shining with excitement. She looked a little out of breath, her hair slightly windswept as if she had rushed straight here. The thought made Agatha’s ego swell a bit.</p><p>“Well, you didn’t waste a second, did you?” Agatha teased, but the warmth in her tone gave her away.</p><p>“Wouldn’t dream of it,” Rio replied, stepping in and tugging her close, arms wrapping around Agatha’s waist as if she belonged there. She gazed at her with a softness that made Agatha’s throat tighten. “Need company? Or something else?”</p><p>Agatha gave a faint smile, relaxing into Rio’s arms and letting herself be held, if only for a moment. “I don’t want to think tonight.”</p><p>Rio’s grin softened, her gaze steady as she nodded, understanding without needing more words. She gave Agatha’s waist a gentle squeeze, her hand drifting up to trace the line of her jaw, and in that brief, quiet pause, Agatha felt a spark of anticipation bloom into a blaze. “I can do that. I figured you might be in a mood,” she teased adjusting the bag on her shoulder, “so I brought some backup.”</p><p>Agatha raised her eyebrows with a curious smile before taking Rio firmly by the hand and pulling her up to her room. The instant they crossed the threshold Agatha pulled her close, their mouths meeting with a fierce, hungry urgency that erased every trace of lingering hesitation.</p><p>She didn’t know what would happen after tonight, but she was determined to make it count. As if Rio could feel her swirling uncertainty she kissed her with an urgency and desperation Agatha hadn’t felt since the first time they hooked up by the pool.</p><p>Agatha led them into her room and quickly began to remove her clothes, Rio watched with a curious expression but followed her lead. “All business huh,” she teased, pulling her shirt over her head.</p><p>“Show me what you’re packing.” Agatha, replied, removing her pants and flopping back onto the bed. She looked almost regal as she leaned back against the ridiculous number of pillows, spreading her arms leisurely to drape over the headboard. </p><p>Rio pulled a strap on from the bag and Agatha nodded in agreement. “What else?”</p><p>Rio grinned mischievously, moving to rest one knee on the bed leaning over Agatha, “What makes you think there’s something else?”</p><p>“Well, I figured if that was all you brought, you would’ve taken the chance to wear it over here under your clothes,” Agatha teased, reaching to pull at Rio’s belt loop. “Seems like something you’d be into.”<br/>
<br/>
Rio gulped and she bit her lip in thought, “Well fuck. I hadn’t thought of that. Filing that away for another time.” She leaned down and kissed Agatha quickly. “But you’re right, I also brought this.” She pulled from her bag an oval band with a hole cut in the center.</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrowed, “Is that a knee brace?” She asked, suddenly a little defensive. If this was Rio making some teasing age joke she didn’t appreciate it.</p><p>Rio laughed and shook her head. “No, noーwell,<em> kind of </em>, you’ll like it though. Hang on let me show you.” </p><p>Agatha watched skeptically as Rio pulled the band over her leg to rest just above her knee, her eyebrows raising in realization as she pulled a dildo from her bag through the hole in the band, securing it against her. Rio rolled to lay on top of her, smiling playfully. “I’m guessing you haven’t tried this?”</p><p>She shook her head, “It’s a knee strap? I don’t know that I see the appeal. It looks a little ridiculous.”</p><p>Rio smirked, unbothered by her lover’s skepticism. “You say that now. But I find it helps with… flexibility.” She moved her knee to press between Agatha’s legs as she applied some lube to the toy. “Besides, it also lets me do this,” she said moving to straddle Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>And as Agatha felt her make contact, felt both how wet Rio already was against her thigh as well as the head of toy press against her, she suddenly understood. “Oh,” she growled eyes lighting up with delight, “I see.”</p><p>“I know how much you like to have me in your lap grinding on you,” Rio husked, leaning over to nip at Agatha's ear. And I also know how much you like having me inside you. This lets you get two things you love at the same time. I’m very generous like that.” Rio smiled, leaning down to kiss her, her hands moving to massage over her breasts. “Think it’s enough to help you stop thinking for a bit?”</p><p>“Shut up and show me,” Agatha growled, reaching to pull Rio against her.</p><p>Any doubts left her as Rio pushed the toy inside her. With this, Rio was able to get closer, deeper, and use more of her strength to drive into her. And each time she moved her knee, Agatha felt the hot spread of her against her thigh. She moaned as she tangled her hair into Rio’s hair, pulling forcefully and kissing her with an eager tongue and teeth.</p><p>They shifted a bit so that Agatha was half sitting up, her knees bent slightly. Rio straddled over her half in her lap, half kneeling. She took Agatha’s face between her hands, kissing her slowly as she began to rock her knee.</p><p>“Fuck, this feels, fucking incredible.” Agatha gasped, grabbing desperately at Rio’s hips and pulling her harder against her. Rio moaned with her, the muscles in her stomach drawn taut as she moved her hips and knee in unison. Agatha let her nails dig in a little bit, the hunger in her fueled further as Rio moaned.</p><p>I told you,” she began to tease, but her snarky comment was lost as Agatha reached a hand to wrap around her throat.</p><p>“I <em> told you </em> , to shut up and show me.” Agatha hissed, though her eyes softened for just a moment as she quirked an eyebrow as if to silently ask <em> you okay with this? </em></p><p>Rio moaned and nodded, placing her hand over Agatha’s and encouraging her to squeeze slightly. She looked desperate, wanton, feral. Agatha imagined she probably did too.</p><p>“I <em> only </em> want to hear you say my name.” She said, reaching her other hand between them to find Rio’s clit. The woman above her whimpered and nodded, driving the toy faster against her.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio groaned, moving her hand to rest on Agatha’s chest to support herself. She rolled her hips against her more desperately. Agatha moaned as she felt her spreading over her. </p><p>She kept up a steady stream of praise, egging Rio on, and pushing them both further. Her fingers continued to pass urgently over Rio’s clit as she spoke to her. <em> You’re so fucking wet. You feel so good. You look so hot like this. </em>And in return, Rio repeated her name over and over again like a sacred prayer.</p><p>Rio moved her knee back enough to slip her fingers between them, pressing harshly at Agatha’s clit. She immediately cried out, moving her hand from Rio’s throat to the back of her neck instead, pulling her down into a rough kiss. They gasped against each other, tongues clashing, teeth knocking each other. She wasn’t sure which thrusts were hers and which were Rio’s, just that they both were rapidly approaching some point of no return. </p><p>“Agatha, Agatha, I’m going toー” Rio’s words came out as a choked sob as she desperately tried to push herself closer to Agatha.</p><p>“With me,” Agatha said fiercely though she could no more deny the woman on top of her than she could stop her own orgasm that hit her like a freight train at that exact moment. They continued to move together, sweating and panting, kissing and biting, grabbing and pulling, until suddenly it was all too much. </p><p>Agatha gasped and let herself fall fully back against the bed. Seconds later, the breath was knocked out of her as Rio collapsed on top of her.</p><p>She wrapped both arms around her, still needing her closer. Her heart was racing, and she could feel Rio’s too. Agatha moved her lips to Rio’s face, not quite kissing, just dragging them over her skin.</p><p>Rio hummed softly and nuzzled closer, kissing under Agatha’s jaw. “Can I talk now?” She asked softly, her eyes warm and her grin turning playful.</p><p>There was a low hum in her chest as she couldn’t help but chuckle. She reached up and gently brushed away a lock of hair away from Rio’s eyes.</p><p>“Yeah. We can talk,” Agatha said softly, slightly nervous about what conversation she was opening herself up to.</p><p>But Rio remained quiet, just moving her head to rest her ear over Agataha’s heart. They lay there for a while, and Agatha began to wonder if she’d fallen asleep on top of her.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>There was a long pause and her heart felt like it was going to burst out of her chest.</p><p>Rio’s fingers traced small, absentminded circles on Agatha’s shoulder, her breathing shallow as if she were working up the nerve to speak. Agatha held her breath, waiting patiently, not wanting to interrupt whatever Rio was piecing together. Her pulse quickened as she watched the shift in Rio’s expression.</p><p>“I…” Rio began, her voice a little unsteady. She paused, swallowing, her gaze dropping as if the words she was considering were too fragile to risk eye contact.</p><p>Agatha’s heart was hammering now, a mix of anticipation and apprehension swirling within her. She’d caught this look in Rio before—a rare, open honesty she usually deflected with a joke or a flirtatious smile. She knew that whatever Rio was on the verge of saying would change something between them, make things more real. And though she didn’t know how she felt about that yet, a part of her wanted to hear it all the same.</p><p>But then, as if catching herself, Rio flashed her usual easy grin, eyes sparkling with a familiar mischief. “I was just gonna say… you’re way too comfortable. You’re making it really hard for me to ever want to get out of this bed,” she teased, nudging Agatha playfully.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, the tension in her chest loosening as she relaxed back into the moment. She couldn’t deny the flicker of relief that ran through her, but at the same time, there was a pang of disappointment—a part of her that had wanted to hear whatever Rio had left unsaid.</p><p>“Guess I should feel flattered,” she replied, brushing her fingers through Rio’s hair with a soft, understanding smile. She sensed that this deflection was Rio’s way of protecting herself, and, for now, she was grateful. </p><p>They settled into a comfortable silence, Rio curling closer, her hand resting on Agatha’s heart as if grounding herself. Agatha held her, letting the moment linger as they both avoided the depth of what they were feeling, content to let it exist in the quiet between them for just a little longer.</p><hr/><p>After settling in at her desk the next morning, Agatha dove into the Jefferson case files, trying to shake off the haze of her night with Rio. The office felt different—sterile and impersonal after the warmth of her summer break. But she set her jaw, determined to pour herself into the work. She’d handled dozens of cases like this before: divorce, infidelity, property settlements. She knew how to navigate them, even if she didn’t always like what she uncovered.</p><p>Later that evening, returning to a familiar pattern, she took the files home, spreading the documents across her sectional as she began to dissect the case. Mrs. Jefferson had been married for nearly twenty-five years, a seemingly perfect life on the surface—until she’d found her husband with his assistant, a woman just twenty-six years old. Agatha read the words in Mrs. Jefferson’s statement: <em> “It’s like I don’t recognize him anymore, or myself. I gave him everything, and he… he traded me in like I was nothing.” </em></p><p>The details gnawed at Agatha, stirring up feelings she’d carefully kept buried. She saw herself in those words, memories of her own marriage slipping back into focus. Claire, standing in their kitchen, arms crossed as she declared that Agatha had been emotionally<em> absent, </em> that she’d given her heart and soul to her career and left her wife in the dust. </p><p>But, unlike Mrs. Jefferson, Agatha hadn’t even been given the courtesy of an affair to explain it all. Instead, she’d just become a stranger in her own marriage, replaced in her ex’s life with the comfort of new friends and a fresh start that Agatha had paid for. Now, here she was, seeing the same betrayal play out in someone else’s life, hearing the same frustration echoing back at her.</p><p>Her fingers tensed around a sheet of paper, her mind drifting to Rio. The careless, age-old stereotype that had haunted her whispered at the edges of her thoughts. <em> Younger. Temporary. </em> Even though she knew Rio had never made her feel disposable, never treated her like a passing fling, the insecurities clawed their way up, filling her with an irrational doubt she didn’t want to acknowledge. </p><p>She pushed the case files away with a sigh, burying her face in her hands, the weight of her past and her present colliding uncomfortably.</p><p>Agatha sat with her phone clutched in her hand, staring at the screen, thumb hovering over Rio’s contact. The knot in her stomach tightened, a bitter mix of longing and guilt. She knew she couldn’t let this go on, couldn’t keep pretending that a fling could stay as simple as they’d both thought it would. Not when every text from Rio stirred up feelings she wasn’t prepared to face, not when she knew how it could end. </p><p>Before she could talk herself out of it, she sent a message: </p><p>“Can you come over?”</p><p>The response came almost immediately, a flash of emojis and excitement on her screen.</p><p>
<em> “On my way, gorgeous ;) Can’t wait to see you.” </em>
</p><p>Another text.</p><p>
<em> “Was just thinking about you too! You have perfect timing.” </em>
</p><p>Another.</p><p>
<em> “Plus we didn’t get to use everything else in my bag ;)” </em>
</p><p>Agatha’s heart sank, her throat tight as she read the words. The flirty, carefree tone that once lifted her spirits now felt like a cruel reminder of everything she was afraid of. <em> She’s going to be crushed, </em>  she thought, the weight of her decision pressing down. Rio’s eagerness, her bright enthusiasm—Agatha knew she’d never meant to mislead her, but the hurt was already inevitable. </p><p>As she waited for Rio to arrive, Agatha moved around the room, trying to steady herself. She picked up the scattered case files, piling them neatly to keep her hands busy, to push back the doubts clawing at her resolve. She knew ending this now was the right choice, even if it felt like tearing out her own heart in the process.</p><p>“It’s unlocked,” Agatha called. She was lying on the couch and couldn’t be bothered to get up. She heard Rio slip inside and come searching for her.</p><p>When Rio spotted her, her usual bright smile faltered slightly as she took in Agatha’s tense posture, the tightly clenched jaw, and the way her arms were crossed defensively across her chest. She approached slowly. Her warmth didn’t fade but her movements were gentler, as though sensing that something fragile lay between them. As if she was afraid of scaring Agatha off.</p><p>“Hey,” she murmured, slipping off her shoes. “Rough day?”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze dropped, her fingers digging into her arms. “I don’t want to talk about it.”</p><p>Rio blinked, visibly taken aback, but recovered quickly. Her brows softened with understanding as she reached out, resting a light hand on Agatha’s shoulder. “Alright,” she said quietly, giving her space. “We don’t have to talk about anything.”</p><p>She looked at Agatha with that easy smile, her hand sliding down to entwine her fingers with Agatha’s, grounding and steady. She tugged gently, coaxing her to make room next to her on the couch. “C’mere,” she murmured, settling down next to her.</p><p>Agatha hesitated, but the kindness in Rio’s eyes pulled her in, and her arm found its way around her, her thumb tracing soothing circles over Agatha’s hand, warm and grounding.</p><p>“I’m glad you texted me,” Rio whispered, leaning close enough that her breath brushed Agatha’s cheek. “Let me help you forget all about it, if just for a little while.”</p><p>Her voice was soft, laced with tenderness, and as she looked at Rio’s patient, gentle face, Agatha felt her heart twist with an ache that was as comforting as it was painful. She’d wanted to end things tonight, but somehow, she couldn’t bring herself to say the words.</p><p>They stayed there for a while, Agatha not talking and Rio not pushing. But she could feel her stomach twisting like a viper poised to strike.</p><p>Agatha sighed, running a hand through her hair as she finally began to talk, her voice strained. “The case I’m picking up—it’s a mess. Husband, wife, couple of kids, years of loyalty... and then the guy decides to ruin it all for some girl twenty years younger than him. It’s… awful. Honestly, he’s disgusting. And I can’t help but feel like—” She paused, her fists clenched. “Like I’m no better than this asshole.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened, but she immediately shook her head. “Hey. No. That’s not the same, not even close.”</p><p>Agatha’s expression hardened, and she pushed herself up off the couch to pace, her words spilling out faster now, almost desperate. “Isn’t it, though? I’m just another older woman, having her fun with someone twenty years younger. You really think I’m not the same as him?”</p><p>Rio’s jaw tightened, a flicker of frustration flashing in her eyes, though her voice remained gentle. “Agatha, come on. You’re the one being childish right now.” When Agatha bristled, Rio held up a hand, not backing down. “Listen to me. If you don’t want this anymore, if you don’t want to see me—then just say it. Don’t blame it on some guy in your case file. That’s not fair to you, or to me.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to protest, but Rio stepped closer, her tone steady, controlled, as if choosing her words carefully. “I’m not some victim here. You didn’t lure me in, and you didn’t trick me. I’m a grown woman, and I know exactly what I’m doing with you. If you want to end things, that’s on you—but don’t act like you don’t have control over your life.”</p><p>The words hit Agatha like a punch, and instinctively, her voice turned sharp, lashing out. “Control over my life? Really? That’s easy for you to say, Rio, when you’re young and just beginning. You don’t know what it’s like to look back and feel like maybe you’ve been on the wrong path this whole time.”</p><p>Rio’s face softened even further, and she stepped forward, reaching for Agatha’s hand, even as Agatha’s expression stayed hard. “Maybe I don’t get it exactly,” she murmured, her fingers gentle as they held onto Agatha’s. “But I know that blaming yourself for feeling something—something good—isn’t going to help anything.”</p><p>For a moment, Agatha’s anger wavered, and she looked down, conflicted. She could feel the warmth of Rio’s hand, the patience in her gaze, and it unraveled something tight inside her.</p><p>Rio’s hand cupped her cheek so gently, “Agatha, look, I’ll put all my cards down right now—”</p><p>“Rio, don’t, please—” Agatha shut her eyes and winced, she tried to turn away but Rio placed a hand on her hip holding her in place.</p><p>“No, Agatha you need to hear me, I need you to know, to know that I—”</p><p>“Don’t!’ Agatha shouted, and she felt sick as she watched Rio recoil slightly from her, her hands dropping to her sides. “Please. Please don’t.” She said, her voice breaking as tears began to fall.</p><p>Agatha’s shoulders heaved as she struggled to catch her breath, overwhelmed by the raw ache rising within her. She hadn’t meant to shout. She hadn’t wanted to see that flash of hurt cross Rio’s face, nor the way her own heart twisted painfully in response. She swiped at the tears spilling down her cheeks, but it was useless—she was unraveling right there in front of her.</p><p>“Agatha…” Rio’s voice was soft, almost tentative now as if she were afraid of pushing her further away. But she took a careful step forward, eyes never leaving her face. “You don’t have to shut down every time it gets hard. I know it’s easier to push me away, to tell yourself you don’t deserve this, but… you don’t have to do that with me.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened, and she pressed her hands to her face, feeling the weight of everything she’d been holding back crash over her. “You don’t understand, Rio,” she choked out, her voice a strained whisper. “This isn’t just… a fling for me. It was supposed to be, but it’s not. And that terrifies me because if I let this mean something… if I let you in… it’s only going to end up hurting you. Or me. Or both of us.”</p><p>Rio’s expression softened further, and she gently took Agatha’s hands, lowering them from her face and holding them between her own. “I know the risk, Agatha. I’m here because I want to be. I’m not afraid of it… or of you.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her, her defenses slowly crumbling as she took in Rio’s open, earnest gaze. She wanted to believe her, to take comfort in that steady assurance, but fear kept her walls intact, even as her heart ached to let them fall.</p><p>After a long silence, Agatha finally whispered, “What if I mess this up? What if I hurt you?”</p><p>Rio’s smile was gentle as she lifted Agatha’s hand, brushing a soft kiss against her knuckles. “Then you mess it up. Then you hurt me. Maybe I hurt you. Maybe we tear each other to pieces. Maybe one day you tell me to get the fuck out and that you never want to see my face again.” She looked up at her, unwavering. “But any of that would hurt less than if I walked out the door right now without even trying.”</p><p>The tenderness in Rio’s gaze melted the last of Agatha’s defenses, and she felt herself lean forward, letting her forehead rest against Rio’s. Her breaths were shallow and shaking.</p><p>“I think you should go,” she said shakily, tears streaming down her face.</p><p>“Agatha, I know what you <em> think </em> should happen,” Rio whispered, brushing her hand through her hair. “What do you want?” </p><p>And that was the question that broke her, that kicked her feet out from under her and made her collapse fully against Rio as she sobbed with ugly gasping breaths.</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<em> “I don’t know.”  </em>
</p><p>Gentle hands pressed into her back, Rio’s thumbs rubbing in slow circles. Agatha couldn’t remember the last time she cried like this. Not through her wife walking out or the following divorce proceedings. Not when her mother had died, <em> good riddance </em>. Not once, perhaps in her entire life, had she wept like this.</p><p>Maybe that was why she couldn’t stop and was now sobbing in the arms of her one-month-long situationship. She would have berated herself if all her energy wasn’t focused on gasping air into her lungs.</p><p>But Rio held her through it all, all the same. When the initial flood of tears had passed and Agatha began to feel her face start to flush with shame instead of tears, Rio finally spoke. </p><p>Her voice was gentle as she held her close, still rubbing those comforting circles. “Hey,” she murmured, leaning back just enough to look into Agatha’s eyes. “It’s okay.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, her face burning as she looked down, but Rio lifted her chin gently with a finger, not allowing her to retreat into herself completely.</p><p>“Agatha,” she said, her tone low and soft as if she were a trapped animal, “you’ve got a lot you’re working through. A lot that you’ve been locking away for a long time, I think.” She gave a small encouraging smile. “And that’s okay. It’s good actually. You don’t have to force everything into how you think it should be. You don’t have to force yourself into who you think you should be. Not for me. Not for anyone else.”</p><p>She tried to respond, but the words were caught in her throat and Agatha caught herself blinking back another wave of tears. Rio’s steady hands continued to anchor her, soothing her in a way she’d never allowed or expected.</p><p>Rio continued, her gentle hands never leaving her. “Take your time. Work through what you need to. And when you’re ready一if you’re ready一you just let me know.” She smiled kindly, too kindly Agatha bitterly thought, before letting her voice grow a little playful as if she knew that Agatha had met and exceeded her emotional quota for the whole damn year in one night. “And remember, I swing by Wednesdays and Fridays so if you want to pretend this never happened no nude sunbathing then.” Rio teased her gently.</p><p>Rio’s words settled deep within her. She felt that flicker of shame again, an urge to apologize, to pull away and bury everything she’d just lay bare… but Rio’s patient gaze held her in place. She took a shaky breath, “I… I don’t know what to say,” she whispered hoarsely.</p><p>“You don’t have to say anything.” Rio gently brushed her fingers over her cheek, wiping away the tear tracks. “Just take care of yourself, Agatha. And when you figure out what you need, call me.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, her fingers twisting in the fabric of her shirt as she pulled the neck up to wipe her face. She desperately wanted to ask Rio to stay. Not for sex, just to have someone next to her in the massive bed in her empty home. But that was a level of vulnerability she wasn’t sure she could take. She straightened her posture and wiped at her eyes with her thumbs.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she said softly, trying to pull her voice back into a less pathetic tone. “You're, uhm, you’re right.” Agatha shifted from one foot to another. </p><p>Rio moved her hands into her pockets and shrugged. “I know. All my exes say I’m annoyingly well-adjusted.” She flashed a grin at Agatha hoping to make her smile.</p><p>Agatha did, even though it didn’t reach her eyes fully. “I’m sure you weren’t expecting to come over and get covered in tears. I’m sorry that I一”</p><p>“Agatha. Relax. You’re so afraid of scaring me off. <em>You’re too old for me, you’re too emotional, you work too much</em>,” Rio interrupted to playfully mock her before growing serious again. “I get that you’re used to having to defend your work every day. You don’t have to defend your heart. You don’t have to justify how you feel. You do you.”</p><p>“Thanks for that Yoda.” Agatha snarked, rolling her eyes as she turned to make her way into the kitchen. But Rio caught her wrist and forced her to turn towards her again.</p><p>“I mean it, Agatha. Don’t spiral over this. Don’t treat it like a case. Just go with your gut.” She smiled fondly, “I hope that brings you back my way but if it doesn’t, no hard feelings, you’re still my favorite customer.” Rio gave her a cheeky wink and kissed her hand before Agatha could pull it away. “Te veo!” She called, breezing out the door and pulling it shut behind her.</p><hr/><p>Over the next few weeks, Agatha took these words to heart and settled into a routine that felt foreign in its simplicity. She took each day one at a time, filling her hours with small, personal milestones that didn’t involve work or the distraction of someone else’s company.</p><p>One morning, she found herself lingering in the kitchen, staring at her mostly empty fridge. She hadn’t done much grocery shopping lately, always opting for takeout or whatever leftovers she could find, but that morning she felt an urge to cook. She pulled out some eggs, peppers, and a bit of cheese, determined to make herself an omelet. Her first attempt stuck to the pan and came out scrambled instead, but she laughed it off, determined to try again.</p><p>On her second attempt, she managed to get it right, folding the omelet just as it began to crisp. She plated it, and sitting down at her kitchen counter, she realized it was the first time she’d made herself breakfast in… she couldn’t remember how long. There was a quiet satisfaction in the ritual of cooking, of tasting something she’d made just for herself.</p><p>Later, while tidying up, she passed by the door to her spare room. She hesitated before opening it, her gaze falling on the rowing machine gathering dust in the corner. She’d bought it maybe a year ago with an ambitious goal to use it daily, but life had quickly gotten in the way. </p><p>She rolled it out of the corner and set up her phone with a workout playlist, adjusting the settings and gripping the handle. The first few minutes felt awkward as her muscles, long unused to this type of exercise, struggled to find the rhythm. But soon, her body settled into it, her breathing syncing with the pull and release of each stroke. When she finally finished, her muscles ached, and her lungs were burning, but there was a sense of release, of reconnecting with her body in a way she hadn’t for a long time.</p><p>Reaching out to old friends was harder than Agatha had expected. She hadn’t realized how many had faded over the years, casualties of her marriage and the tunnel vision that followed her divorce. But one evening, feeling braver than usual, she texted Alice—a friend she hadn’t seen in half a year at least but who had always known how to bring out a lighter side of her. To her relief, Alice responded warmly and suggested dinner at a cozy restaurant downtown.</p><p>When they met, Agatha felt a bit awkward at first, unsure how to fill the gaps between them, but Alice’s easy laughter quickly set her at ease. They reminisced, sharing old inside jokes and memories of Agatha’s ex, laughing over stories Agatha had long forgotten.</p><p>“So, how’s Claire doing?” Agatha asked, her voice more hesitant than she intended. She felt silly for caring, but curiosity had gnawed at her for too long. She focused on her glass, swirling the last sip of her wine.</p><p>Alice raised an eyebrow, then smiled in a way that was both sympathetic and cautious. “She’s doing well, actually,” Alice said gently. “She’s dating someone new—a teacher, I think. They seem happy. It’s... casual, from what I hear.” She looked at Agatha as if gauging her reaction.</p><p>Agatha nodded, feeling an odd mix of relief and something sharper. She didn’t know if it was jealousy or guilt, but it settled somewhere in her chest. “Good for her,” she murmured, managing a small, polite smile. She hadn’t expected to feel much, but hearing about her ex dating again stirred up old feelings she’d thought she’d buried.</p><p>Alice gave her a searching look. “And what about you?” she asked, resting her chin in her hand. “Are you seeing anyone?”</p><p>The question caught Agatha off guard, and she stammered, glancing down at her plate. “I—uh. Not really.” She paused, unsure how to explain Rio without it sounding... complicated. “I mean, I had something recently,” she finally admitted. “But it wasn’t serious. It was... it was supposed to be casual.”</p><p>Alice tilted her head, smiling knowingly. “Supposed to be?”</p><p>Agatha let out a reluctant laugh. “Yeah. It, uh, ended up being a bit more than that.” She fiddled with her napkin, not meeting Alice’s eyes. “Or maybe just more complicated than I planned.”</p><p>Alice grinned, giving her a gentle nudge. “Agatha Harkness, overthinking things? Never,” she teased. “So, what happened?”</p><p>Agatha sighed, leaning back in her chair. “She’s... she’s different from anyone I’ve ever been with. She’s easygoing, doesn’t play games, and somehow, even when she’s teasing, she’s... kind.” She shook her head, smiling faintly as she remembered Rio’s warmth, her patience. “But I don’t know if I’m ready to let someone in like that again. I’ve got too much to work through first.”</p><p>Alice watched her with a look of understanding, nodding slowly. “You know, sometimes the right person comes along when you’re not ready, and sometimes they wait for you to catch up. And sometimes,” she added with a knowing smile, “they don’t wait at all, and that’s okay too.”</p><p>Agatha took in her words, feeling them settle. The truth was, she didn’t know if she was ready or if Rio was someone she was meant to hold onto—or if Rio even wanted that from her. The night they broke things off she had seemed close to a confession but had just as easily slipped into giving Agatha space. But sitting here with Alice, talking openly about her feelings, Agatha felt the weight on her shoulders ease just a little.</p><p>As they lingered over their empty plates, Agatha hesitated before adding, “There’s one more thing.” She bit her lip, trying to keep a straight face. “This… woman I mentioned? She’s also my, um, pool girl.”</p><p>Alice’s eyes widened, and then she burst out laughing, her laughter filling the cozy space around them. “Of course she is! Agatha, I’ve always said you gave off serious cougar vibes.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but couldn’t help laughing, feeling a hint of warmth in her cheeks. “Oh, please. It’s not like that.”</p><p>“Uh-huh. Keep telling yourself that.” Alice’s grin was both teasing and fond. “So, what? Every time she cleans the pool, you come up with some excuse to check on her ‘progress’?”</p><p>Agatha snorted, surprising herself at how she didn’t feel the usual twinge of irritation. “Maybe a little,” she admitted, enjoying the way Alice’s laughter wrapped around her.</p><p>Alice leaned back, still grinning. “Nothing wrong with that. Besides, sounds like she’s got you all twisted up. I’d say that’s a good sign.”</p><p>Agatha shrugged, her smile lingering as she traced patterns on her napkin. “Maybe. Or maybe I just finally found someone who knows how to challenge me.” She threw Alice a playful look. “You never know, maybe I’ll show up next time in a convertible with a much younger girlfriend. Complete the midlife crisis bingo card.”</p><p>Alice laughed, raising her glass in a mock toast. “Oh, I’d love to see it. Here’s to you, Agatha, <em> finally </em> having some fun!”</p><p>As they clinked their glasses, Agatha realized she wasn’t even bothered by the joke. For the first time, she felt herself growing comfortable in her own skin, allowing herself to enjoy the humor and warmth of it.</p><p>“Thanks for tonight Alice,” she murmured, smiling genuinely. “I don’t know why I let myself get so isolated.”</p><p>Alice squeezed her hand across the table. “Well, that’s what friends are for, right? We’re here to drag you back out when you start acting like a hermit. We aren’t just Claire’s friends, we’re yours too.”</p><p>They shared a laugh, and by the end of the night, they’d agreed to grab dinner again in a couple of weeks. Agatha left the restaurant, feeling lighter and more connected than she had in a long time.</p><p>At work, Agatha threw herself into her cases with the same intensity as always, but she made one small but significant change: her laptop stayed in the office. It felt strange at first to leave without her work bag, almost like she was forgetting something important, but she forced herself to try it for just one week. </p><p>To her surprise, she slept better, her mind less occupied by the constant presence of unfinished work. She realized that when she returned to the office each morning, her mind was sharper, and more focused. Her clients deserved her best, she reminded herself, and if taking better care of herself helped her be more present, then it was worth it.</p><p>And yet, despite the progress she was making, Agatha couldn’t help but think of Rio. In quiet moments, her mind would drift back to her—a flash of Rio’s teasing smile, the way she’d held her so gently on that last night together. She’d wonder what Rio was doing if she was thinking about her too, and there was a warmth there, along with a sharp pang of longing she couldn’t quite shake. </p><p>But Agatha didn’t text, didn’t call, didn’t go out to the pool on cleaning days. She wasn’t ready yet; she needed to hold onto this space she was creating for herself, to build her own foundation before she could face whatever might still be between them.</p><p>In these small, quiet moments—cooking, rowing, laughing with friends, and leaving work behind when she stepped through her front door—Agatha felt herself growing, finding a peace she hadn’t realized she’d lost. And though there were still unanswered questions and feelings she wasn’t quite ready to face, she found herself okay with the uncertainty, okay with moving forward one small step at a time.</p><p>The last piece in the puzzle was to determine whether Rio had been a fluke. Whether she was truly the counterpart Agatha had built her up to be in her mind, or if she’d just been a thrilling interlude. In her gut, Agatha felt that she knew the answer even if she wasn’t ready to say it out loud. But still, it didn’t hurt to be sure. Reluctantly, she allowed her friends to set her up on a string of <em> perfectly fine </em> dates.</p><hr/><p>On her first date with Sophie, Agatha arrived early at the wine bar they’d agreed on. She felt a little flutter of nerves, though she told herself it was just the novelty of going on a date after so long. When Sophie arrived—a tall woman with a warm smile and an easy laugh, a lawyer as well—Agatha couldn’t help but feel at ease.</p><p>“Wow, this place is nice,” Sophie said as they settled in with their glasses of wine. “I think I could get used to this kind of date.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, raising her glass in a toast. “Well, I’ll take that as a compliment.”</p><p>As they talked, Sophie asked Agatha about her work and recent projects, genuinely interested in hearing about her cases. Agatha found herself talking more freely than usual, surprised by how open she felt with Sophie. </p><p>But as Sophie launched into a story about her own mishap with a client, Agatha found her mind wandering. She’d catch herself glancing at the door, as if half-expecting to see Rio stroll in, casually late, tossing a quick wink her way. She snapped back to the present as Sophie’s laughter filled the air.</p><p>“Did I lose you there for a second?” Sophie teased, arching an eyebrow.</p><p>“Oh, no, sorry,” Agatha said, laughing softly. “Guess I’m just a little distracted tonight.”</p><p>Sophie smiled, tilting her head thoughtfully. “Well, maybe next time we can go somewhere more relaxed. I’d love to hear more about what makes you tick.”</p><p>As they said goodbye, Agatha felt a sense of gratitude for Sophie’s kindness, the easy way she’d deflected her distraction. Yet, as she walked to her car, she couldn’t shake the feeling that something was missing.</p><hr/><p>Her second date was with Marissa, a chef with an infectious laugh and a tendency to pepper every story with exaggerated details of her kitchen mishaps. By the way she told it, it was a wonder she had any fingers left. They met at Marissa’s restaurant, where she had secured them a private corner table.</p><p>“So,” Marissa said, pouring a glass of wine for Agatha. “Be honest. Have you ever had a true dining disaster?”</p><p>Agatha laughed, shaking her head. “Not as dramatic as yours, no. The last thing I tried to bake brownies out of a box they ended up like a rock.”</p><p>Marissa threw her head back, laughing. “Oh, I’d love to see that. Next time, I’ll teach you a few tricks.”</p><p>The dinner was rich with flavors, and Marissa’s charisma kept the evening lively. But as Agatha watched Marissa describing the art of making the perfect risotto, she felt an odd sense of distance. Marissa was brilliant, her passion for food infectious, but there was a kind of warmth she missed—a softness that Rio always seemed to carry.</p><p>“So, what do you say, Agatha?” Marissa’s voice broke through her thoughts, and Agatha blinked, realizing she hadn’t heard a word.</p><p>“Sorry, Marissa,” she said, feeling her cheeks flush. “Guess my mind’s somewhere else.”</p><p>Marissa offered a playful smile, but Agatha caught a flicker of disappointment. “Well, you know where to find me if you decide to bring it back here.”</p><p>When they hugged goodbye, Agatha thanked Marissa, but as she walked back to her car, she found herself thinking that she’d rather be eating takeout on the sofa with Rio than indulging in the finest dishes with anyone else.</p><hr/><p>The third date was with Lena, a painter Agatha had met at a gallery opening a couple of weeks back. They met at a cozy jazz lounge, where Lena immediately swept her into an animated conversation about art, passion, and the sheer thrill of creation.</p><p>“You ever feel like that?” Lena asked, eyes bright with intensity. “Like there’s something inside you that just has to be let out?”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, considering the question. “Maybe… I feel that way when I’m really in the groove with a case. There’s a thrill in uncovering the truth, in pushing until I get to the heart of things.”</p><p>“That’s beautiful,” Lena said, reaching across the table to squeeze Agatha’s hand. “See? We’re more alike than we realized.”</p><p>Agatha offered a smile, but her heart wasn’t in it. Lena was brilliant, a whirlwind of ideas and charm, but it didn’t feel right. There was a spark missing, something that made Agatha hesitate when Lena leaned closer, her voice dropping to a soft murmur.</p><p>“Would you want to come back to my studio sometime?” Lena asked, her gaze intense. “I’d love to paint you.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, searching for the right response. “That’s really sweet, Lena… but I think I might not be ready for that.”</p><p>Lena withdrew her hand, offering a kind, understanding nod. “No pressure. Just thought I’d ask.”</p><p>As they parted ways, Agatha couldn’t help but feel a pang of regret—not because of what she’d said, but because each date seemed to drive home the same, inescapable truth: none of these women made her feel the way Rio did. The comfort, the laughter, the way she felt utterly at ease in her own skin—those things weren’t so easy to find. </p><p>And as she drove home alone that night, Agatha let herself wonder if maybe, just maybe, the person she really wanted was the one person she was still avoiding.</p><hr/><p>Wanda had come the closest. Convenient too, her cheerful neighbor had invited herself over under the guise of gathering ideas for her backyard renovation.</p><p>Wanda leaned back on one of the lounge chairs by the pool, her flaming hair catching the late afternoon sunlight. She had a way of making herself comfortable anywhere, and today was no different. Agatha sat across from her, feeling the weight of Wanda’s presence as much as her own swirling thoughts. </p><p>“I have to admit,” Wanda said, stretching her legs out and glancing around the pool area, “you’ve got the perfect setup here. Makes me jealous every time I look out my window.”</p><p>Agatha smirked faintly. “Well, maybe once you start your renovation, you’ll have the nicest backyard on the block.”</p><p>“Maybe,” Wanda said with a sly grin. “But I think I’d still be sneaking over here for the company.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow, sipping her iced tea. “Is that so?”</p><p>Wanda leaned forward slightly, her eyes locking onto Agatha’s. “You know it is. Don’t act so surprised.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t reply right away, letting the words hang between them. Wanda was stunning, confident, and direct—qualities that Agatha might have found irresistible once upon a time. But now, there was a strange hesitation she couldn’t quite shake.</p><p>Wanda didn’t seem deterred by the silence. She shifted closer, her voice dropping to a teasing murmur. “So, Agatha… you just gonna sit there, or are you gonna let me kiss you?”</p><p>Agatha blinked, startled by the boldness, though not entirely displeased. She could feel the weight of Wanda’s gaze, the energy crackling between them. Maybe this was what she needed—a distraction.</p><p>“Well?” Wanda prompted, her smile softening as she leaned in slightly.</p><p>Agatha hesitated for only a second before leaning forward, closing the space between them. Wanda’s lips were soft, her touch confident, and for a fleeting moment, Agatha let herself get lost in it. But just as the kiss deepened, the sound of the gate opening jolted them apart.</p><p>Agatha turned sharply, her stomach flipping as she saw Rio walking in, a crate of pool chemicals balanced effortlessly on one hip. She froze mid-step, her eyes landing on the two women. </p><p>“Oh,” Rio said, her tone light and breezy, though her smile didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Didn’t mean to interrupt.”</p><p>Agatha stood quickly, guilt twisting in her chest. “Rio, I—”</p><p>Rio raised a hand, waving off whatever Agatha had been about to say. “Don’t let me stop you two.” Her tone was casual, her smile fixed, but Agatha caught a flash of something in her expression—jealousy? Hurt? It was gone as quickly as it came.</p><p>Wanda, for her part, didn’t seem fazed. She leaned back in the lounge chair, a curious look on her face as she watched Rio unload the crate by the pool shed. “You must be the famous pool girl,” she said, her voice playful.</p><p>Rio chuckled, glancing over her shoulder. “That’s me. Pool girl, chemical supplier, occasional handywoman. I wear a lot of hats.”</p><p>Agatha felt her cheeks burn. “Rio, you don’t have to—”</p><p>“Really, Agatha,” Rio said, cutting her off gently. “I’m just dropping these off. I’ll get out of your hair.”</p><p>And with that, she turned, her movements brisk as she walked back to the gate. She didn’t look back, but the sharp sting of her absence hit Agatha harder than she’d expected.</p><p>“Well,” Wanda said, breaking the silence. “She’s… something.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond right away, her eyes lingering on the gate where Rio had disappeared. Wanda tilted her head, studying her with a knowing smile. </p><p>“Something tells me you’ve got a bit of a history there,” she said, her tone light but probing.</p><p>Agatha let out a slow breath, sinking back into her chair. “It’s… complicated.”</p><p>Wanda laughed softly. “Complicated seems to be your thing.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t reply, her mind too busy replaying the brief flash of jealousy on Rio’s face. She knew she should be here, in this moment, with Wanda—someone who was easy and straightforward. But all she could think about was the way Rio had walked away, and the ache it left behind.</p><p>“Agatha,” Wanda sang, reaching to trail her fingers over her arm, “can I interest you in something… not complicated?</p><p>Agatha snapped out of her thoughts, glancing over at Wanda’s sly smile. The teasing lilt in her voice pulled her back into the present, and she managed a faint smirk of her own. </p><p>“Not complicated, huh?” she said, her tone dry but carrying a hint of challenge. “What does that even look like?”</p><p>Wanda leaned closer, her confidence unwavering. “Oh, you know. No strings, no expectations—just two adults having a little fun.” Her fingers skimmed lightly over Agatha’s arm, sending a pleasant shiver up her spine.</p><p>Agatha hesitated, her gaze dropping to Wanda’s hand. This was exactly what she thought she wanted, wasn’t it? A distraction. A chance to shake off the heaviness that clung to her. She looked back up, meeting Wanda’s eyes, and nodded. </p><p>“That sounds… perfect,” she said, her voice quiet but certain.</p><p>Wanda grinned, her green eyes glinting with mischief. “Glad to hear it.” She stood, taking Agatha’s hand and pulling her to her feet. “Because I’d hate to think I wasted all this charm on someone who wasn’t interested.”</p><p>Agatha allowed herself a small laugh, following Wanda’s lead as they headed inside. The summer air clung to them, thick and warm, as they stepped into the cool, dim interior of the house. Wanda’s hand didn’t leave hers, and the confidence in her stride felt contagious. </p><p>As they made their way down the hall toward Agatha’s bedroom, Wanda glanced over her shoulder, her voice taking on a softer tone. “Just so we’re clear, Agatha—this is casual. One time. No overthinking it.”</p><p>“Crystal clear,” Agatha said, her voice a little breathless as they reached the doorway.</p><p>“Good,” Wanda murmured, spinning back to face her. Her hands slid up to Agatha’s shoulders, her touch light but insistent. “Now, no more distractions.”</p><p>Agatha leaned in, their lips meeting again, the kiss deeper this time, fueled by urgency and mutual understanding. Wanda was everything she’d promised—direct, bold, and uncomplicated. And for a moment, Agatha let herself get swept up in it, the weight of her thoughts momentarily forgotten.</p><p>But even as they tumbled onto the bed, Wanda’s laughter in her ear and the press of her body against hers, a small part of Agatha couldn’t quite let go of the image of Rio’s retreating figure. It lingered like a shadow in the back of her mind, refusing to be silenced, even as she tried to lose herself in the present.</p>

<p>
<span>Wanda kissed like it was a challenge—bold, demanding, almost competitive in the way she pressed against Agatha as if she wanted to claim victory over her. Her lips moved with confidence and intent, urging Agatha to match her pace or fall behind. It was exhilarating, no doubt. Wanda kissed like she </span>
<em>
<span>knew</span>
</em>
<span> she was desirable and enjoyed wielding that power, her teeth grazing against Agatha’s bottom lip in a way that was equal parts playful and insistent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But the sharpness of Wanda’s kisses only served to highlight how different they were from Rio’s. Rio’s kisses had been soft and deliberate, like she was savoring every moment, drawing Agatha in with a warmth that made her feel seen and safe. Where Wanda’s touch felt like a fire that might burn too brightly, Rio’s felt like a steady flame, sure and patient, inviting rather than demanding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Wanda’s hands roamed, her movements confident and sure, Agatha found herself trying to focus on the thrill of it—the sharpness, the heat. But she couldn’t shake the memory of how Rio’s hands had held her like she might slip away, the way her lips had brushed against hers like a quiet promise, rather than a declaration of dominance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda pulled back, sitting up from where she straddled Agatha, a triumphant smirk tugging at her lips as she whispered, “You keeping up?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha forced a smile, matching Wanda’s playful energy. “Oh, I know I am,” she said, shoving Rio from her mind and pouncing forward to flip Wanda onto her back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She focused on the woman beneath her instead of the one in her head. She wouldn’t allow herself to keep making comparisons. Wanda’s body was softer, </span>
<em>
<span>she’s so soft</span>
</em>
<span>. Her eyes a different color,</span>
<em>
<span> her eyes are piercing green.</span>
</em>
<span> Her moans were lower, </span>
<em>
<span>she sounds sultry. </span>
</em>
<span>With each comparison, Agatha forced her mind to spin into a compliment, and to remind herself who she was with, she began to speak them aloud, husking them against Wanda’s ear. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She focused on the way Wanda drug her bottom lip between hers, the way she kissed over the bridge of her nose, the way her finger rested against the dimple of her chin as she pulled Agatha by the chin into another hungry kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I get it though,” Wanda murmured roughly as she pulled Agatha’s hands to the hem of her dress. That was another way she was different, Wanda </span>
<em>
<span>took</span>
</em>
<span>. Agatha complied, pulling it over her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s that?” Agatha hummed, dipping her head to catch her breast in her mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pool girl. She’s hot. Think she’s taking new clients?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze for a split second then growled and pinched her nipple between her teeth in warning. Wanda’s words hung in the air, a jagged edge slicing through whatever heat had built between them. Slowly, she pulled back, her lips parting from Wanda’s skin as tension began to coil tight in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What did you just say?” Agatha asked, her voice low but sharp, betraying the sudden flood of emotions she couldn’t quite name yet—jealousy, possessiveness, and something more dangerous that made her blood run hot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda smirked, utterly unbothered, and brushed a strand of hair over her shoulder. “Relax. I’m just saying she’s easy on the eyes. Didn’t think someone like you would mind a little competition.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw clenched, “Competition?” she echoed, her voice laced with disbelief. She couldn’t tell if she was angrier at Wanda for saying it or at herself for how much it affected her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Wanda said, holding her hands up in mock surrender, a teasing grin still tugging at her lips. “I’m just kidding. No need to get territorial. Or… is that what’s going on here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bristled. Territorial. The word stung because it felt too close to the truth, and yet she hated the idea of anyone thinking she was </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> person—someone petty, irrational, and possessive. But the reality of it burned inside her. The thought of anyone else looking at Rio, thinking about Rio, was unbearable.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s grin widened, clearly enjoying the reaction. “Oh, I hit a nerve, huh? Didn’t peg you for the jealous type. Guess the pool girl’s got you wrapped around her finger, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s enough,” Agatha snapped, her tone cutting through Wanda’s amusement like a blade. She roughly flipped Wanda onto her stomach, tangling a hand in her hair and pushing her face against the pillow as she leaned to bite against her shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda tilted her head to the side, smiling triumphantly, taking glee in how easily she was getting under her skin. “What? Is it not that </span>
<em>
<span>casual</span>
</em>
<span> after all hon?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t answer. She couldn’t. Instead, she ran her free hand through her hair, trying to steady her breathing, trying to sort through the chaos roaring in her mind. Before Wanda could make another needling comment, she hauled her onto her knees and roughly shoved two fingers inside her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t have to be a bitch just because you want to get fucked rough,” she finally replied, before putting all of her effort into shutting up the woman beneath her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Annoyingly, even after Wanda came she still carried the same haughty attitude. She languidly rolled over and stretched out in Agatha’s bed, far too poised for someone who had just minutes ago been screaming her name. “You’re welcome,” she drawled, smirking as she watched Agatha pace the room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her an annoyed glance, “You mean thank you?” she asked, retrieving her shirt from the floor and pulling it back over her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda smirked and shook her head, “No, you heard me. </span>
<em>
<span>You’re welcome.</span>
</em>
<span> I think I just helped you realize something very important.” She stretched once more before getting up from the bed and pulling her clothes back on.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned against the door, her arms crossed slightly. Whatever teasing comment Wanda said next faded into the background as her thoughts spiraled around one inescapable truth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>This wasn’t about Wanda. It was never about Wanda.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio. It always came back to Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes snapped back to Wanda as the woman approached, leaning towards Agatha and then tapping her cheek twice. Agatha rolled her eyes and kissed her cheek. “Thank you, Wanda,” she finally teased back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda’s eyes gleamed mischievously and she winked at her. “You’re </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> welcome. I’ll see myself out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped aside, opening the door for Wanda with a dramatic gesture, her sarcasm barely masking the turmoil still churning inside her. “Don’t let the door hit you on the way out,” she quipped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda grinned. “Don’t worry, darling, I won’t. And hey,” she paused in the doorway, glancing back at Agatha with a glint in her eye, “if it doesn’t work out, well, you know where I live, and you can let pool girl know as well.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised a brow, arms still crossed. “Noted,” she replied dryly, though she knew there wouldn’t be a next time. Wanda was bold, fun, and unapologetically herself—qualities Agatha could appreciate—but the moment had left her feeling more hollow than she cared to admit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Wanda strolled down the hall, humming to herself, Agatha shut the door with a sigh, leaning her forehead against it for a moment. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re welcome,” she muttered, echoing Wanda’s parting words with a sardonic twist. But as the silence of her home closed in, her chest tightened. Wanda had been right about one thing: this had forced her to realize something very important.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pushed off the door and, as she heard the front door shut, headed downstairs and wandered into the living room, sinking onto the couch and staring at the pool through the glass doors. The water shimmered under the soft glow of the outdoor lights, but her mind was miles away—stuck on the image of Rio’s face, that brief flash of jealousy, and the way she’d then walked away so breezily, as if it hadn’t bothered her at all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand came up to rub at her temple. “What the hell are you doing?” she whispered to herself, the question hanging in the air unanswered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She wanted to let it go, to stop thinking about Rio, to stop feeling the pull that had never quite let up. But Wanda’s teasing words played on a loop in her mind, taunting her with the truth she didn’t want to admit but could no longer avoid. Agatha leaned back, closing her eyes. Pretending it didn’t matter wasn’t working anymore. It never had.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Almost on cue, she felt her phone vibrate and she glanced down to see Rio’s name flash across the screen.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Hey. I’ll come by Monday at 9 to close up the pool for the season. Just wanted you to be aware.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at the message, rereading it three times. It was polite, professional even. But all she could focus on was </span>
<em>
<span>why</span>
</em>
<span> Rio had texted at all. </span>
<em>
<span>Had</span>
</em>
<span> seeing her with Wanda made her jealous? Or worse—had she been so put off that she didn’t want to be around her anymore? The thought made Agatha’s chest tighten. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She considered her response carefully before typing back:  </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Thanks for the heads up. I’ll be at work, so you’ll have the place to yourself.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She hit send and placed the phone facedown on the coffee table, determined to push the interaction from her mind. But as she stared at the pool outside, her thoughts spiraled. Wanda’s teasing voice crept in:</span>
<em>
<span> Pool girl. She’s hot.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned and covered her face with her hands. She wasn’t going to be able to leave this alone. All weekend she fretted, until finally coming to the simplest solution.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>At six in the morning on Monday, Agatha grabbed her phone again and dialed Lilia, her partner at the firm. It rang twice before Lilia picked up.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha? Everything okay?” Lilia’s voice carried a mix of concern and surprise—Agatha wasn’t exactly known for casual calls.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I—” Agatha hesitated, then forced herself to sound convincingly ill. “I’m not feeling great. I think I need to take today off.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a beat of silence before Lilia replied, sounding even more surprised. “Oh, of course! I’ll have your assistant reschedule your meetings and—well, let me know if you need anything?”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you,” Agatha said, already feeling the guilt gnawing at her. She’d never called in sick, not even during her marriage when Claire had tried to convince her to play hooky or begged her to take it easy when she actually was sick. But this time, it felt different—necessary, even.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>After hanging up, she leaned back into the couch, staring at the ceiling. A plan was forming in her mind, half-formed but insistent. If Rio thought she could breeze in and out without a word, Agatha wasn’t going to let her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And if that meant calling in fake sick for the first time in her life, so be it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sound of the pool gate opening pulled Agatha from her pacing in the living room. She turned sharply, spotting Rio stepping inside with her usual ease, a bucket of supplies in one hand. But when their eyes met, Rio froze mid-step, her expression shifting from surprise to something more guarded as Agatha stepped out the sliding door.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio said slowly, setting the bucket down. “I thought you were at work.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha crossed her arms, trying to steady herself. “I decided to stay home today.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked, clearly caught off guard. “Oh.” She straightened and glanced toward the pool, her tone casual. “Well, I’ll just get started. You don’t have to hang around if you don’t want to.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do want to,” Agatha said firmly, taking a step closer. “Actually, I’ve been waiting for you.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated, her casual demeanor faltering. “Waiting for me?”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes.” Agatha exhaled slowly, forcing herself to meet Rio’s gaze. “I wanted to talk. About… what happened. With Wanda.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s jaw tightened, and she looked away, running a hand over the back of her neck. “You don’t have to explain anything. It’s not my business who you kiss.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think it is.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes snapped back to hers, startled.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry,” Agatha said, her voice soft but firm. “I shouldn’t have kissed her.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why not?” Rio mumbled, her tone almost bitter. “You’re allowed to. You’re supposed to, remember? Explore, figure out what you want. I’d be pretty fucking hypocritical if I got upset about it. That’s what I wanted for you.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Was it?” Agatha stepped closer, her heart pounding.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio dropped her gaze. “I thought it was. I wanted you to be happy. To find what you needed. But seeing you with her…” She trailed off, her voice low. “It affected me more than I expected.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath caught. She closed the gap between them, her voice trembling with urgency. “Why, Rio? Why did it bother you?”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated, her usual confidence slipping. “I <em>tried</em> to tell you,” she muttered, her voice barely audible. “That night, when we—when you ended things. I wanted to tell you then, but you wouldn’t let me.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>The words hit Agatha like a punch to the chest. She thought back to that night, to how she’d shut Rio down, too scared to hear what she’d been on the verge of saying.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was wrong,” Agatha admitted, her voice breaking. “I was scared, and I shut you out. But I’m here now, and I’m listening.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes searched hers, uncertain. “Agatha, you don’t have to—”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I do,” Agatha interrupted, her chest tightening. “Because I feel something for you, Rio. I’ve felt it since the first day we met, and I’ve tried to ignore it, but I can’t anymore.” She took a shaky breath, the weight of her confession finally spilling out. “I’m falling for you. And I think I’ve been falling for you this whole time.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s lips parted, her expression raw with disbelief and something else—something that looked a lot like hope. “You mean that?”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, her voice steady despite the vulnerability in her chest. “I do.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, neither of them moved, the space between them electric with possibility. Then, slowly, Rio reached out, her hand brushing against Agatha’s cheek.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve been falling for you too,” Rio whispered, her voice soft but certain. “Probably from the moment you gave me shit for being concerned about your ass burning in the sun.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed shakily, relief and joy bubbling in her chest. “So what do we do now?”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smile was small but genuine as she leaned in, their foreheads nearly touching. “Whatever we want.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And when their lips finally met again, it felt like the answer to every question Agatha hadn’t dared to ask.</span>

<p>
<span>They kissed until they were breathless, and even then they only barely parted, lips still brushing as their foreheads pressed together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I missed you,” Agatha murmured, cupping Rio’s face between both her hands. “You have no idea.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I do.” Rio said firmly, moving her hand to trace one of the worry lines on her forehead. “Because I missed you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closed her eyes, leaning into Rio’s touch as if she could melt into her completely. Her voice was soft as she confessed,  “I was stupid. I thought I could forget about you. Thought I could just move on. That this was just something silly, that there wasn’t any world where you’d actually be interested in…” she trailed off.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s fingers stilled, her thumb gently brushing Agatha’s cheekbone. “You weren’t stupid,” she said quietly. “You were scared. I was too.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled back just enough to meet Rio’s gaze as her hands slid down to rest on her shoulders, grounding herself. “But I’m not scared anymore,” she said, her voice steady. “Not of this. Not of you.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s lips twitched into a small, tender smile. “Good,” she murmured, leaning forward to steal another kiss, this one slower, deeper, as though she wanted to savor every second. When they finally pulled apart again, Rio’s expression turned more serious.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So what now, Agatha?” she asked, her voice low but steady. “Because I can’t pretend that I’m okay with casual anymore. I’m not looking for halfway. If we do this, I’m all in.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha squeezed Rio’s hands gently, her eyes soft. “I don’t want casual either,” she said firmly. “And I don’t want halfway. I’ve never been good at half-assing anything. I’m in, Rio. All the way.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a breath she didn’t realize she’d been holding, her shoulders relaxing. A small, shy smile played on her lips, a rare vulnerability flickering in her gaze. “I have to admit something,” she said, her voice quieter now, almost hesitant.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilted her head, her brow furrowing slightly. “What is it?”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced down at their joined hands, her thumb idly brushing over Agatha’s knuckles. “I was </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> jealous,” she admitted, her cheeks tinged with color. “When I saw you with that redhead.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyebrows shot up, surprise flickering across her face. “You? Jealous?”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes but couldn’t help the small laugh that escaped. “Yeah, I know. Shocking.” She rubbed the back of her neck with her free hand, looking more bashful than Agatha had ever seen her. “I told myself I wanted you to explore, to figure out what you wanted. But when I saw you kiss her…” She shook her head, her voice trailing off.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>"What?” Agatha pressed, stepping closer.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio met her eyes, the raw honesty in her gaze making Agatha’s breath hitch. “It hit me how much I didn’t want to see you with anyone else. And it scared the hell out of me because I realized how much I…” She paused, her voice catching.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart pounded as she stepped closer, her fingers brushing Rio’s cheek. “How much you what?”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhaled a shaky laugh, her hand covering Agatha’s on her cheek. “How much I care about you,” she admitted softly. “I wanted to come off as cool and collected and mature about the whole thing, but the truth is, I couldn’t stop thinking about you. Even when I told myself to back off, I kept finding excuses to come by.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips curved into a soft smile, her heart swelling at the vulnerability in Rio’s words. “You’re not the only one,” she confessed. “I’ve been a mess. Like I did all the things, I started working out一”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio playfully squeezed her shoulder, “trust me, I noticed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes fondly, “I started meeting up with old friends again, I’ve been trying to work less at home, I learned how to make an… okay omelet. I was working on just making myself better. And I thought a few dates, Wanda, would help me be sure of that.” Her eyes crinkled as Rio grumbled, and she paused to kiss her pout away. “But none of it stopped how I felt seeing you walk away that day… it broke something in me.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand tightened around Agatha’s waist as she pulled her closer, her voice low but steady. “Then don’t let me walk away again.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I won’t,” Agatha promised, her voice firm as she leaned in to kiss Rio again, this time with a slow, aching tenderness that spoke volumes of everything she had been too scared to say.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>When they pulled apart, Rio chuckled softly, the tension in her shoulders finally easing. “You know, Wanda did me a favor.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, her lips quirking into a smirk. “Oh, really?”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, her confidence returning. “Yeah. She helped you figure out what you want. And thankfully, it’s me.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, the sound light and free. “I guess she did.” She leaned in, her forehead resting against Rio’s. “And for the record, I don’t need any more detours to figure that out again.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smile widened, her hands slipping to Agatha’s waist. “Good,” she murmured, pulling her closer. “I plan on making damn sure of that.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, they stood there, wrapped in each other’s presence, the rest of the world fading into the background. The only sound was the soft ripple of water in the pool and their steady, shared breathing.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio broke the silence first, her lips quirking into a smirk. “So… does this mean you’re firing me as your pool cleaner?”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted, swatting her arm playfully. “Don’t push your luck.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, her confidence returning in full force. “Guess I’ll stick around a little longer then.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha led the way upstairs, her hand slipping into Rio’s as they walked through the house. It felt surreal to have Rio here like this, not just as a guest or a visitor but as someone she could let in—really let in. There was room in her home for one more.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When they stepped into the bedroom, the soft lamplight bathed everything in a warm glow, and for a moment, they just stood there, taking each other in. Rio’s eyes swept the room, lingering on the neatly made bed before landing back on Agatha with a teasing glint.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can we try something new?” Rio quipped, though there was a softness in her tone that undercut the bravado.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes but couldn’t help the small smile that tugged at her lips. “I’m listening.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, the sound low and genuine as she tugged Agatha closer, wrapping her arms around her waist as she slowly began to remove her clothes. “I want us to take our time. I want to kiss every inch of you. And we have all day. I want to still be here, making love to you when it gets dark and when the sun comes up again.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s breath hitched, her fingers brushing the curve of Rio’s jaw. “You’re awfully confident.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, leaning in until their noses almost touched. “What can I say? You bring it out in me.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>The teasing shifted into something deeper as Rio kissed her again, slow and unhurried, as though they had all the time in the world. Which, for today at least, they did. Agatha’s hands slid into Rio’s hair, her heart racing as she melted into the kiss.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finally broke apart, Rio rested her forehead against Agatha’s, her voice soft and teasing. “So, are you going to let me do that?”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, the sound warm and unguarded. “I can’t think of any better way to spend my first ever sick day,” she murmured, her hand sliding down to squeeze Rio’s.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” Rio said, her voice dipping into a playful drawl. “Because I don’t think I could sleep still wondering if your hot neighbor was better in bed than me.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned, shaking her head. “Don’t ruin this moment.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, her arms tightening around Agatha as she pressed a kiss to her temple. “Never,” she promised, her voice soft and sincere.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>They fell into bed together and Rio made good on each of her promises. They whispered and touched gently, fully exploring one another, taking their time for the first time. At some point, Agatha cried, and Rio paused to kiss each tear away and murmur gentle affections against her ear. They fell asleep together, tangled in her sheets, and when Agatha woke up to the sound of Rio softly snoring, her body draped protectively over hers, it felt like the most natural thing in the world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>For the first time in months, perhaps longer, Agatha felt at peace, the swirling doubts and fears quieted by Rio’s steady presence. And as they drifted into the comfort of each other’s arms, she realized she didn’t need to look for what was missing anymore. It had been here all along.  </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<em>
<span>Four Months Later</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The hotel ballroom shimmered with warm golden light, strung with twinkling garlands and an extravagant crystal chandelier that cast prismatic reflections across the polished floors. Agatha stood just outside the grand double doors, her hand clasped tightly in Rio’s, giving her a reassuring squeeze.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ready?” Agatha asked, her voice soft but steady as she glanced at Rio.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked stunning in a tailored black suit, the jacket slightly cropped to reveal the sleek silk blouse beneath, its deep emerald tone accentuated her olive complexion and brought out a tint of hazel in her eyes. A slim black tie and understated silver cufflinks completed the look, giving her a suave edge. Her usually tousled hair was combed back, though a rebellious curl still fell artfully over her brow.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I should be asking you that,” Rio replied with a crooked smile, her nerves betraying her as she adjusted the cuffs of her blazer for the third time. “You’re the one walking me into </span>
<em>
<span>your</span>
</em>
<span> world.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked every bit the part of a powerhouse in a floor-length champagne-colored gown with a high neckline that cascaded into a low, elegant back. The fabric caught the light, shimmering, and her diamond earrings sparkled with each turn of her head. Her dark hair was swept up into an intricate knot, leaving her neck exposed in a way that made Rio’s gaze linger.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You look incredible,” Rio added, her voice dropping as she leaned in slightly. “Like, you should come with a warning sign. Like we should just ditch this stupid holiday party and head up to our room. Bet that dress would look even better一”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, some of the tension lifting from her shoulders as she leaned in to press a quick kiss to Rio’s cheek. “Hush. So do you. But we’re a package deal now. And you can’t blame me for wanting to show you off. Let’s go knock them dead.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Arm in arm, they stepped into the room. Conversations hummed and champagne glasses clinked, but a few heads turned at their entrance. Agatha held her head high, exuding her usual confidence, but Rio could feel a slight tremor. She gave her a reassuring squeeze, grounding them both.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Almost immediately, Lilia appeared, her sharp eyes gleaming as she took in the sight of them. Lilia, ever the bold one despite her age, was dressed in a shimmering gold jumpsuit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, well, well,” Lilia said, her lips curving into a knowing smirk as she approached. “If it isn’t Agatha Harkness, finally deigning to show up at one of our little gatherings with a plus one. And not just any plus one.” Her gaze flicked to Rio, appraising but warm. “So, </span>
<em>
<span>you’re</span>
</em>
<span> the girl I’ve heard so much about.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio flushed but held her ground, offering her hand. “Rio,” she said, her voice steady but her smile a touch shy.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Lilia repeated, shaking her hand with a grin. “I like you already.” Turning back to Agatha, she added with a teasing lilt, “And I’ve got to say, Harkness, you’re really batting above your league.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, though a faint blush crept up her cheeks. “Don’t start, Lilia.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I wouldn’t dare,” Lilia said, her grin widening. “But you better believe the rest of the office will.” She took a sip from her champagne glass and winked at Rio. “Just keep her out of trouble, will you?”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, finally relaxing as she slipped an arm around Agatha’s waist. “That’s the plan,” she replied smoothly.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a sideways glance, impressed and amused by her ease. She leaned in closer, her lips brushing Rio’s ear as she whispered, “You’re handling this way better than I thought you would.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fake it till you make it,” Rio murmured back, her lips twitching into a grin.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>As the three of them moved deeper into the crowd, Lilia kept up her good-natured teasing, introducing Rio to a few colleagues and occasionally dropping sly comments that made Agatha roll her eyes and Rio laugh.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>But as the evening went on, Agatha found herself watching Rio more than anyone else, marveling at how easily she navigated the room, her charm and wit winning over even the most skeptical of Agatha’s colleagues.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>For the first time, Agatha didn’t feel like she had to carry everything alone. Rio was by her side, steady and sure, and it felt... right.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time they made their way to the dance floor, swaying to the slow rhythm of some schmaltzy holiday classic, Agatha realized she didn’t care what anyone else thought. This was her world, yes, but she didn’t have to walk it alone. Not when Rio had such an easy way of making everything infinitely better.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>And as she rested her head on Rio’s shoulder, their fingers intertwined, Agatha finally felt at home.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio broke away to use the bathroom and Agatha took the chance to order two drinks at the bar. Lilia sidled up to her, still smirking playfully.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, well, she is </span>
<em>
<span>something</span>
</em>
<span> isn’t she?” She hummed, playfully knocking Agatha’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, exasperated, rolled her eyes again and took a sip of her drink as Lilia continued.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I like her. She’s sharp. You need someone who will say no to you. She’s funny too. You should be proud, she’s a catch.” Lilia gave her a cheeky wink as they watched Rio emerge from the bathroom and search the crowd for them. Anyone with eyes could see how her searching glances melted into pure adoration as her eyes landed on Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
