<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>Dr. Rio Vidal shrugs off her white coat and tosses it onto the chair in the corner of her office. With a sigh, she sinks into her desk chair, exhaustion pressing into her bones. Despite that long week, at 45, she finally feels like she has her life together. The grueling years of medical school and residency stole her twenties, but now? Now, she has a solid career, a respectable salary, and a work schedule that, while not perfect, is at least manageable. A personal life? Nonexistent. But that’s hardly a priority.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a few more clicks, she closes her patient charts for the day. A whole week off stretches ahead of her. A week well earned and long overdue. Tomorrow, she plans to do absolutely nothing - Just take-out and movies in bed. Bliss. And then a few days later, an obligatory girls' night she’d been guilted into.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just as she leans back, ready to savor the thought of freedom, a voice breaks through her moment of peace.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Sharon’s head appears around the doorframe, her usual oversized quilted bag slung over one shoulder. As the hospital’s internal medicine coordinator, Sharon is the one who keeps the interns in line, assigns them to attendings, and orchestrates those painfully awkward team-building events.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just wanted to remind you about the new intern BBQ tomorrow afternoon,” she says with a bright smile. “I need you to bring hot dog buns.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Will do, Mrs. Davis.” Rio gives a sarcastic thumbs up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s Shar-on” She reminds her for the hundredth time before disappearing down the hall. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhales sharply. It’s not that she dislikes working with interns. In fact, watching them evolve from terrified baby docs into competent clinicians is, admittedly, rewarding. But this week has been brutal. She’d been counting on solitude and booze, and now, instead of a peaceful escape, she’s stuck entertaining a group of nervous 20-something’s over hot dogs and sodas. </span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>The next day is brutally hot. One of those “fry an egg on the sidewalk” kind of days that news anchors love to test for the sake of views. Whoever decided interns should start in July deserves to be shot. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio considers skipping the BBQ. It’s not like Sharon could punish her for not showing up - one of the benefits of being an attending. But in the end, she pulls on a dark green tank top and jean shorts. She picks a longer pair, trying to maintain the illusion of “respectable attending” but one who knows it’s hot as fuck and she doesn’t want armpit stains. She gathers her hair into a loose ponytail, swipes on a little mascara and calls it good. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The air conditioner blasts as she pulls into the parking lot. At the far end, she spots Sharon setting out condiments and chips. Somehow, she’s roped Steven Strange into manning the grill. Amazing, considering half the time he seems lost in another dimension, leaving his residents to fend for themselves while he meditates in a call room.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A few outpatient attendings linger, strategically avoiding unnecessary interaction with the interns. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And there are the interns. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Even from across the lawn, they’re easy to spot. A loose circle of bodies, standing together yet not truly interacting. They skirt around each other, avoiding direct eye contact, the awkward tension palpable. These are top-tier nerds with the social skills of a crouton.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s nothing like Grey’s Anatomy. No steamy hookups in elevators, no dramatic confessions. Just sweltering heat and buzzing flies amidst the dying grass of an unkept city park. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So Sharon, what fresh hell awaits?” Rio drops the buns onto the picnic table. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Sharon throws her a look.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m kidding,” Rio throws up her hands in mock protest. “As long as you don’t make me play two truths and a lie as an icebreaker.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I came up with something far more interesting this year.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>And that’s how Rio found herself in a makeshift circle, surrounded by the 2 other attendings who bothered to stick around and 7 interns who haven’t decided to bail yet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She takes a long drink of her too warm soda and unceremoniously plops down into the grass. The sun is oppressive and she feels the sweat rising on her back already. She shields her eyes from the too bright sun, choosing to look down and pick at a dandelion resting next to her ankle. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Sharon jumps into the middle to introduce herself, and the unfortunate game. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is a guessing game.” She starts handing out pens and small squares of paper to each person. “Write down an interesting fact or hobby of yours. One of our fabulous attendings will read them out loud and try to guess who they belong to!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The small crowd lets out a small, collective groan. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stares at the blank paper. Every year it’s the same - a week into their residencies and she won’t remember a single fun fact about them. She will know who has the ability to talk to patients like they aren’t robots and who gets their charting done on time so she actually makes it out of the hospital at a decent hour. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She quickly jots down “I am scared of spiders.” Her generic go-to answer for these games every year. She folds the paper, once, twice into a perfect square. As she rises to pass the card to Sharon, she sees something coming toward the group. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Well not something. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Someone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Based on her age and the fact that Rio knows all the attendings, she must be a new intern.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But what intern shows up as a welcome BBQ for their new job in </span>
<em>
<span>that. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Her high waisted jean shorts cut off at her butt. No, above her butt, the sloped edges of her ass hanging out the back. Despite the fact that she looks no more than 5’4”, her legs look impossibly long. The expanse of smooth, milky skin stretches down to her feet, adored in high heeled wedges completely inappropriate for the venue. Her brunette hair is tied up in a ponytail, but still reaches halfway down her back in messy waves. She’s wearing a deep purple crochet top, cropped to above her belly button. As she heads for the cooler without a word, Rio can see the criss-crossed ties forming three perfect bows across her bare back. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Christ. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio feels the heat coil in her belly at the sight of her. Then the heat quickly rises into her cheeks out of embarrassment for ever thinking of an intern like </span>
<em>
<span>that. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The brunette fetches a cold soda out of the cooler and starts walking toward the group. Rio tries to focus on the dandelion again but she can still see her out of the corner of her eye. The brunette doesn’t open the soda. No, she tilts her head to the side and presses the cold can along her neck. The condensation gathers on her skin before it beads and slides down her collar bones and disappears between her cleavage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallows hard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As if the gods themselves hate her, the girl then waltzes right next to Rio and plops down in the circle next to her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rips the dandelion from the ground.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nice of you to finally join us.” Sharon hands the newbie her pen and paper while quickly explaining the rules. While most interns look at Sharon like this is another test they must pass, this girl actually looks </span>
<em>
<span>bored.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Why do the stupid attendings make us go to these things anyway?” The brunette turns to Rio. “It’s not like any of them even show.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m one of those ‘stupid attendings.’” Rio bites back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh shit. Sorry. I didn’t expect that. I just thought you might be one of those “old” interns that started late.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You think I’m old?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well not old. Just older. Plus I thought you were too hot to be an attending.” She says nonchalantly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Excuse me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The girl just shrugs unapologetically. Apparently calling an attending hot before you’ve even introduced yourself is a perfectly acceptable intern move in her book. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m Agatha by the way.” She doesn’t even attempt to shake Rio’s hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, Rio sticks out her hand, “Dr. Vidal.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ohhh.” She doesn’t return the gesture, just mouths “Dr. Vidal” sarcastically like she’s mocking her. “But what’s your first name? ”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ha. Nice try.” Rio actually laughs at the girl, a smile forming on her face. It feels awfully close to flirting. </span>
<em>
<span>Shit. </span>
</em>
<span>“Dr. Vidal for now.” She shuts it down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay people!” Sharon is clapping her hands together to get their attention. “Pass those papers back!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agtha rushes to scribble something, before glancing sideways at Rio, shielding her answer from her with her hands. Then she passes it back, a smug look on her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A beat passes while Sharon gathers the remaining answers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s put an attending in the hot seat! Dr.Vidal, I’d like you to come up and do the honors. Take a guess at whose fun fact belongs to whom!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The small group of fresh faced doctors look entirely too excited for a game that’s basically the equivalent of child’s birthday party entertainment. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hard to believe this group of newbies will be responsible for patient’s lives soon when today they are writing down “I play drums and piano.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ummm, you?” Rio points to a girl with black hair with red streaks down the front. She sports black pants in 100-degree weather so Rio is guessing she’s the wanna-be rock star type. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The girl nods. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio guesses the next one wrong. “Collects watches” is the most generic, boring fact in the world - of course it belongs to Stephen Strange. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you Dr. Strange for that fascinating fact…” Agatha snickers at the name. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The next paper belongs to an intern named Billy, who turns out to be a twin. His brother, Tommy, is a lawyer. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, Rio grabs the last paper and slowly unfolds it. The writing is small, but elegantly scrolled across the page. She knows who it is, there is only one name that hasn't been called yet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I…” she starts to read. And frowns. “I’m not reading that.” She crumbles the paper, her eyes dart around for a trash can. Finding none nearby, she pockets the paper. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ok….Well I guess that’s a wrap then everyone! Check your emails to see which attending you are assigned to come Monday morning!” Sharon, sensing Rio’s uncomfortableness, jumps in, saving her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait! No one guessed mine!” Agatha springs up from the grass as the others begin to scatter. She stomps toward Rio, reaching out to grab her wrist.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s jumps as her fingers circle her wrist. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn’t read my paper.” Agatha sticks the index finger of her left hand in her mouth, biting at the nail. Her other hand remains on Rio’s wrist. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Write something appropriate next time.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>With that, Rio yanks her wrist out of her grasp and stomps toward her car. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She doesn’t look back, she doesn’t slow down. She slides into the seat and peels away from the curb. The faster she drives, the more flustered she gets until she pulls into her driveway in record time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck!!” She hits the steering wheel, activating the horn and causing her to jump. She works to control her breathing, dropping her head to the steering wheel.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, when she can’t take it anymore, she fishes out that little piece of paper from her pocket, smoothing it out against the dash to read the words once more. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I want to fuck my attending</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With a little arrow pointing right. Exactly where Rio was sitting. </span>
</p><p>
<span>In all her years working as an attending, this takes the top 3 for most brazen moments. The other two weren’t nearly as dramatic for her personally - the time a nurse’s husband showed up and punched the ICU doctor after finding out about their affair and the time a family member threatened to kill her because he thought they were conducting secret COVID experiments on his wife. Interesting antidotes, stories to tell over drinks with friends - but never in her years has any intern ever been so shameless and bold against an attending. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s a ploy, she figures (and hopes). Just a way to try to get under her skin. Or a joke. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio figures the best course of action is to ignore it. Pretend it never happened. Don’t give Agatha the satisfaction of knowing that Rio is really fucking flustered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She tosses the paper into the center console. </span>
</p><p>
<span>— </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio spends the next few days catching up on everything she neglected during her 12-hour shifts - grocery shopping, laundry, tidying up the house.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A couple of work emails wait for her, including the list of residents assigned to her this month. She ignores it, knowing their names won’t make a difference. The first few weeks with new interns are always rough. Not only are they stepping into their roles as full-fledged doctors for the first time, but they’re also navigating a new hospital and an unfamiliar computer system.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She’ll bring her usual donuts on the first morning, though none of them will touch them until midday—when they finally realize they won’t have time for lunch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She doesn't want to give herself a headache before the work week even starts. She’s had her headphones in most of the day, effectively drowning out any thoughts of the absurdity of the BBQ (and Agatha) with music. Because she refuses to let her, an intern, get into her brain. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When her phone finally does buzz, she’s happy to see it’s Natasha texting to remind her to meet at dinner tonight at 7 for girl’s night.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She glances at the clock and realizes it’s already 6pm. Somehow, she spent the entire day avoiding her own thoughts, completely oblivious to the time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Cursing under her breath, she rushes into the shower, scrubbing shampoo into her hair before working it into a foamy lather. She steps back  into the warm water and tilts her head back, eyes closed, feeling the bubbly mixture sliding down her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Without warning, the image of Agatha’s long legs in those too-short shorts slams into the front of her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes snap open.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nope. Absolutely not. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Under no circumstance can she think of an intern </span>
<em>
<span>that way</span>
</em>
<span>. Regardless, the woman is twenty years younger than her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Nope.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jaw tightening, she turns the shower to ice cold, stepping beneath the freezing stream. The shock steals her breath, but she stays put, standing there until the shivering drowns out </span>
<em>
<span>everything else.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Thirty minutes and one freezing shower later, she’s making her way to The Coven &amp; Cork, a popular wine bar in town. The heat hasn’t let up, even as the sun dips behind the horizon, so she’s chosen a black spaghetti strap dress, sans bra. It’s just too damn hot to add any unnecessary material. A pair of black strappy heeled sandals complete the look. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She texts Natasha as soon as she pulls into a parking spot. She gets a quick reply that she’s already got a table, just inside to the right. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Just before Rio steps out of her car, she sees the paper from the BBQ still sitting in her center console. The one Agatha so obscenely scribbled on during their little game. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She grabs it, folds it in half and shoves it into her purse. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio has known Natasha since college, when they were paired together as roommates. They both started as pre-med, but Natasha jumped ship early on to work in cyber security. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha is always hoping for juicy hospital drama and finally Rio has something beyond rumors of nurses sleeping together. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio steps into the dimly lit wine bar, giving her eyes a second to adjust to the light. She spots Natasha’s back from the door, just where she said, at a small two person. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A couple of glasses of red wine and a charcuterie board later, Natasha leans in, eyes twinkling with mischief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So do tell me, Dr. Vidal, what’s the latest tea? Any of the newbie doctors hot?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio coughs as her drink slides down her throat. Her eyes burn as she struggles to regain her composure. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That good, huh?” Natasha laughs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wrong pipe.” She finally manages to choke out while pointing at her throat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, one of them was hot is what I’m hearing.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio purses her lips and shakes her head like she’s rejecting the idea. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“C’mon Rio. I’ve known for you what? 15 years? You’ve had a few flings in college. Our couple of drunken nights. And then what? One serious relationship.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groans.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This isn’t a dry spell anymore. It’s celibacy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay. Fine” Rio huffs. “I have one story for you. About one intern. But it has nothing to do with me and my dry spell.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure…” Natasha gives her a knowing look but leans forward, fully invested in the impending gossip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well we had the welcome BBQ for the new interns,” Rio starts. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ohhh bad food and lawn games, sexy.” She lifts her eyebrows jokingly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well there was one intern who showed up….” Her voice trails off. Her eyes flick to the door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What? Rio?” Natasha snaps her fingers in front of her face to get her attention. “Showed up what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There.” She tries to motion with her eyes toward the door to Natasha’s right but she doesn’t take the hint. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No! Natasha. Right </span>
<em>
<span>there.” </span>
</em>
<span> Rio grabs her chin and turns because low and behold, Agatha just walked in the front door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Like a cartoon character, Natasha’s jaw drops. “</span>
<em>
<span>That’s </span>
</em>
<span>your new intern.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Close your mouth, Natasha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry, it’s just, look at her.” She eyes Agatha up and down a few times. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio does.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>The deep blue suit set. The button-up, just barely concealing what looks like nothing underneath. The tousled waves she scrunches into her hand as she talks, a playful smile curving her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Thank heaven above Agatha doesn’t notice her. She follows the hostess toward the back of the restaurant—presumably to meet friends. Or a date.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Neither of which should matter to Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Because she is her supervisor.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The entire non-encounter throws Rio for a loop. Now, Natasha won’t stop asking about Agatha, but the truth is, Rio knows next to nothing about her. Sure, Sharon has a file on her somewhere, buried in her office. Rio could easily ask for it. No one would question it - just another attending preparing for upcoming rotations.</span>
</p><p>
<span>If she’s lucky, Agatha won’t be assigned to her for months. She might even be off on her endocrinology or cardiology rotations, floating outside the hospital entirely. No chance of running into her. No reason for this ridiculous flustered feeling to persist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That’s all it is - just a reaction. Human biology…and anatomy…at play.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Maybe she just needs to get laid. Hell, maybe she and Natasha should bang one out for old time’s sake.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio? Hello? Are you still with me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio finally blinks, snapping back to the present as Natasha’s hand waves wildly in front of her face.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Was there something else about the BBQ that you were going to tell me?” Natasha seems a bit more concerned now, studying Rio’s face with a furrowed brow. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio digs into her purse and pulls out the crumpled paper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha takes it, reading it over a couple of times. Then her eyes go wide. “Wait… is this about </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yep. That little arrow?” Rio points. “Right where I was sitting.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha lets out a slow whistle. “So what are you going to do about it?” She asks, taking another sip of her wine. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gives her a confused look. “Nothing. I’m her supervisor. Plus, she’s what? 25? Which doesn’t matter. Because I’m like - her teacher.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That didn’t stop Derek.” Natasha says matter-of-factly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Grey’s Anatomy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groans. “That show is fictional Natasha. Real hospitals are nothing like that. We are too busy with too many patients to fuck in call rooms.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“All I’m hearing are excuses.” She jokes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swats at the air in front of her as if slapping Natasha away, but she just laughs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As Rio looks up, she sees it. Agatha walks casually across the restaurant, glancing to the side as if she’s searching for something, like the restroom. But her eyes don’t land on any signs at all. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They land on Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Before she can say a word, Agatha starts walking toward her smirking. Panic flares in Rio’s chest as she scrambles for something clever to say, anything to break eye contact. But Agatha’s gaze shifts down, right to the table in front of her. Right to her paper on the table, now worn and creased from too much folding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A wicked smile crosses her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She strides up to their table, looming over them with a glint of mischief in her eyes. Rio expects her to speak, to quip something, but she just stares at them, a stupid smirk plastered on her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can I help you with something, Agatha?” Rio finally breaks the tension.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I could ask you the same,” she replies smoothly, tilting her head. “Is that my paper from the BBQ?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snatches the paper off the table, crumbling it into her fist. “It was mine.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are a terrible liar.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>A beat of silence.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glances around at the nearby tables, where diners are quietly engaged in their own conversations. Then, with absolutely no warning, she locks eyes with Rio and loudly exclaims in fake shock, “What kind of girl do you think I am, Dr. Vidal!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes widen in horror as the surrounding tables fall into momentary stillness. The woman at the next table gives her a scandalized look. An old man nearby simply blinks in confusion.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But still, Agatha continues, now just trying to cause a scene. “An attending, trying to proposition her intern in the middle of a restaurant!” She gasps, clutching her chest in fake shock.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I did no such –You came over here –I didn’t even –” failing to string together a coherent sentence. She can feel the heat creeping up her neck, settling in her cheeks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha says nothing, eyes darting between the pair like she’s watching a soap opera unfold. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha seems ridiculously pleased with Rio’s inability to quip back. She bites the nail of her index finger and lets out the most ridiculous (and</span>
<em>
<span> definitely</span>
</em>
<span> not adorable) giggle Rio has ever heard. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Annoyed, Rio grabs Agatha’s forearm, yanking her hand away from her mouth. “Stop it,” she growls.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha just seizes the opportunity, dragging her now-saliva-coated finger across Rio’s arm like a napkin. As if that weren’t enough, she leans in close to Rio’s side. Her lips next to her ear. Agatha’s warm breath hits her skin in little puffs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“See you Monday, </span>
<em>
<span>Dr. Vidal</span>
</em>
<span>,” She purrs in a whisper, but loud enough that Natasha could clearly hear. She straightens, offers a playful little wave, and turns sharply on her heel, strutting away without a second glance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The moment she’s gone, Natasha bursts out laughing, doubling over and clutching her stomach.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh you are so fucked!” </span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Monday morning Rio walks into the internal medicine office, in her overly scratchy hospital issue scrubs, donuts in hand. The interns are already there, fashionable early as they should be. They sit at the long conference table in their brand new starched white coats, pockets filled with pens. </p><p>“Dr. Vidal, I brought you a coffee!” An overeager boy greets her, shoving a hot coffee in a to-go cup into her hand. </p><p>“You’re Billy, right?” She takes an appreciative sip. </p><p>He beams like he won some prize. “You remembered!” (It was more like a lucky guess)</p><p>“And…” Rio struggles to recall her name from the bbq.</p><p>“Alice.” She offers. Rio nods.</p><p>Alice sits back in her chair and acknowledges with a lift of her chin, but says nothing. Rio likes her already, she seems no nonsense, focused. Billy frowns, clearly not content with his lack of personal attention. </p><p>“Why are there only two of you?” Rio asks, grabbing her list of patients and scanning a few photocopies for the newbies.</p><p>Billy feels the need to speak up again. He’s already firmly planted himself as just a bit too overeager. It takes some tact to deliver bad news, a sense of confidence to convey a diagnosis to a patient. Billy is already like a dog waiting for you to throw a ball. </p><p>“My email said Agatha was supposed to be joining us.” He starts pulling out his phone and scrolling to the email as he speaks. “I remember her from the BBQ and orientation and she…” </p><p>“Of fucking course, it’s Agatha.” Rio groans, cutting him off. </p><p>“I believe it’s Dr. Harkness now.” Agatha strolls in. She’s got her white coat folded and draped over her arm. She’s wearing custom, tailored jogger scrubs and heeled boots. Heels. In the hospital. Rio lets out an exasperated sigh. </p><p>“Not to me.” Rio begins. “Despite your medical degree, you are still in training.” She speaks to the entire group now. “Everything you do from this point forward, comes back to your attending. It’s my license on the line, not yours. You don’t make a decision without consulting me first. You don’t so much as sneeze without asking me, or I’ll make sure the only patients you see are the ones guaranteed to vomit on you.”</p><p>“Seems a bit dramatic.” Agatha rolls her eyes. </p><p>“Agatha, since you didn’t find it important to be on time for your first day, you get assigned Mr. Rogers. Alcohol withdrawal and liver failure. He was found unconscious in an alleyway. Oh and he has bed bugs.” Rio slides her the patient list for the day. </p><p>A second later, Agatha’s name actually hits her. </p><p>“Harkness?” She questions to herself, racking her brain for where she’s heard that name before. </p><p>“Yes?” Agatha looks up for her paper as if summoned. </p><p>“You’re Evanora’s daughter?”</p><p>“Shhh, don’t say it so loud. I don’t want people to know.” She makes a disgusted face and looks around at her colleagues. They are wholly engrossed in their patient’s charts on their computers. Billy keeps shaking his head as he looks over lab values, seemingly confused. </p><p>“Yeah the name isn’t obvious at all.” Rio points out. “You’re the hospital CEO’s daughter. Her name is on a fucking building.”</p><p>“So maybe you shouldn’t give me the bed bug patient after all.” Agatha teases. </p><p>“Nice try. I’ve met her, you know.” Rio mentions. “She doesn’t seem like the type that would mind you suffering a bit. For the learning experience and all.” </p><p>Agatha lets out a long sigh before plopping down at a computer and opening her patient’s chart for the day. For a while, it’s silent, just the sound of clicking keyboards and scrolling mice as they prepare for the day. At least at work, Rio feels like she has the upper hand, despite Agatha’s earlier antics. </p><p>Rio is prepared to go greet her hospitalized patients far earlier than the interns, as expected. Then the interns will do the same - now completely on their own. Their goal is to function as independent physicians, with Rio as their fallback to keep all their medical decisions in check; to make sure they don’t accidentally kill anyone. Eventually, they will all meet up together to complete “rounds” and discuss all the patients, their diagnoses and treatments together. That’s when Rio will really get a sense of their medical knowledge and how prepared they are for these long three years ahead. </p><p>There is just one last order of business before she officially starts the day.  </p><p>“I’m sure I’m going to regret this, but send me all your phone numbers.” She writes her number on the top of the patient list still sitting on the conference room table. “We can start a text chain. Feel free to text or call me with questions. I know it’s your first month so things are still new. Don’t hesitate to reach out sooner rather than later. If you text that your patient is already dead - I consider that too late.” </p><p>She looks over to see Billy frantically taking notes while Alice listens intently.</p><p>”I believe people called it a ‘group chat’ now.” Billy muses. <br/><br/>“Great, thank you for calling me old.” </p><p>Across the table, Agatha is ignoring the conversation, tapping away on her phone, lips pursed in an amused little grin.</p><p>As Rio steps into the hallway, heading toward the patient rooms, her phone buzzes. Someone must be kicking off the text chain. </p><p>But it’s not a group chat. It’s from a single number.</p><p><em>Was this a sly way of getting my number?</em> </p><p>Agatha. Of course.</p><p>She has to take it one step too far everytime. Despite trying to maintain all professionalism, she feels her chest flutter as she reads the words. Rio bites her cheek to remind herself that she’s in the hospital, as her supervisor. Under no circumstances can she even reply. </p><p>So she begins typing anyway. </p><p><em>I have a feeling you would have found a way to give it to me. </em></p><p>Rio sees the little typing bubble pop up right away. Then disappear. They begin again. So maybe Agatha’s not as self-assured as she gives off. </p><p><em>Careful, Dr. Vidal. Someone might think you are flirting with me</em>. </p><p>Rio feels a wave of adrenaline surge through her as the elevator doors open to the hospital floor. She shoves her phone into her white coat pocket and decides against replying again.  </p><p>—</p><p>Two hours later, Rio is just about finished seeing all the patients for the day. Just one left - the alcohol withdrawal patient with bedbugs. </p><p>She turns the corner to find Agatha sitting at the nurses station, leaning back in a desk chair, her legs propped on the countertop. She’s surrounded by 4 female nurses, all seemingly enthralled with some story she’s telling. Her hands fly animatedly and the nurses lean in closer, eyes locked on hers as she continues. Suddenly they are all bursting out in laughter, smiling white toothy grins at her like she hung the moon. </p><p>Rio watches a young blonde, likely a nursing student, put her hand on Agatha’s forearm as she laughs, giving it a squeeze. Agatha glances up at her and smirks. The same damn smirk she gave Rio at the picnic. And the restaurant. Apparently she gives them to anyone who gives her an ounce of attention.</p><p>The jealousy flares in Rio’s chest. She knows she has no right. None at all. Agatha isn’t hers. She can’t be hers. </p><p>But that ugly, green monster of jealousy snarls again as Rio thinks they shouldn’t be touching her. </p><p>She starts to stomp across the hall, toward the small crowd with no plan in mind. Halfway there, her mind starts listing possible ways to break up the small clique, to get Agatha away from them. </p><p>Shoving Agatha in a supply closet and shutting her up with her mouth comes immediately to mind. </p><p>The jealous beast inside smiles at the idea. Rio’s fingers curl into small fists as she imagines yanking her away, fingers pressed into the small of her back, urging her forward. She would open the small supply closet door, she knows exactly where the rarely used one is - and pull Agatha into her by the collar of her white coat. The smell of her invading her nostrils - Lavender? Vanilla? She wants to shut her up with her mouth, her tongue prying open her lips to taste her. Her fingers buried inside of her until Rio can feel her shatter for her. </p><p>Then she thinks about how many beers she will have to consume tonight to make these thoughts go away enough to sleep. Or how many orgasms she needs before Agatha isn’t haunting her dreams. </p><p>Instead, she lands on a different kind of wicked idea; tamer, but no less calculated. She turns back down the hallway, to the other nurses’ stations, and picks up a hospital phone. The list of resident pager numbers sits directly in front of it, easily accessible to staff. Her finger scrolls down the list until she finds what she’s searching for - Agatha Harkness, MD.</p><p>She dials. Waits for the familiar beep. Then punches in the number of the phone she’s holding, followed by a crisp “911.” In about three seconds, Agatha’s pager will display the callback number- and the urgent emergency code. As Rio sets the phone back on the cradle, a flicker of guilt stirs in her chest. For a split second, she regrets the abuse of power, until the phone rings.</p><p>“Dr. Harkness.” Agatha’s voice comes sharp and a little frantic. “I was paged 911 to this number.”</p><p>“Is flirting with nurses in your job description?” Rio grates. As much as she tries to hide it, the irritation comes through in her voice. </p><p>“You paged me 911. This is an abuse of power, you know?” Agatha almost chuckles. </p><p>“Have you seen your patients? Written notes? Ready for rounds?”</p><p>Rio hears Agatha yawn into the phone. </p><p>“Done. And done. Also Billy decided to take it upon himself to read the MRI on Mrs. Jones by himself. Before radiology. He tried to tell her that her symptoms were anxiety. Radiologist said it’s actually a spinal stroke. So I smoothed things over with her, scolded Billy and called neurology to come see the patient.” Agatha boasts. </p><p>“Billy did what?” Rio almost didn’t hear the rest of it. “I have to go talk to him.” </p><p>“You’re welcome.” Agatha says in a sing-song voice before hanging up the phone. </p><p>Rio scrubs her hands over her eyes. Overeager July interns will be the death of her. She takes a deep breath and picks up the phone again to page Billy, ready to scold him. This is why she can’t get distracted by Agatha. </p><p>—</p><p>Rio grabs her second coffee of the day and a bag of chips before texting the group: </p><p><em>Rounds in 10 minutes in the conference room. </em></p><p>By the time she walks in, the team is already gathered. Alice is mumbling to herself as she preps for her presentation. Billy looks defeated, still reeling from Rio’s earlier talk (well scolding) with him. He’d clearly hoped to prove himself today, but instead, he’s just made himself the one to keep a closer eye on.</p><p>Agatha has her feet kicked up on the table, a package of sour gummy worms resting on her lap. As Rio takes a seat at the head of the table, something small and soft hits her on the temple, landing on the pile of papers in front of her. </p><p>A sour gummy worm. </p><p>“Agatha, what the hell?” Rio narrows her eyes at her but she pops the candy in her mouth anyway. Damn, she forgot how good these are. As she settles in, she flashes Agatha a small smile, tongue in cheek.</p><p>Billy’s hand flies up like he’s in a classroom. </p><p>“Yes?” Rio asks.</p><p>“So if I have a famous mother do I get special treatment too?” He starts rambling. “Because mine isn’t like ‘famous famous’ but she is a doctor at Mayo and she’s researching….”</p><p>Rio cuts him off. “Agatha isn’t getting special treatment. She’s just been doing what she’s told.” </p><p>Billy rolls his eyes. </p><p>“Dude!” Alice snaps, slapping his arm. </p><p>When Rio glances at Agatha, the intensity of her gaze catches her off guard. Her icy blue eyes are large and wide and she’s got a faint blush in her cheeks. She shifts ever so slightly in her chair. She raises an eyebrow as she slyly mouths “ohhh.” And then a knowing smile. She bites her lips and whispers “yes ma’am.” </p><p>Rio coughs, forcing herself to look down at the patient list, the names blurring together. Focus…</p><p>“Okay Billy, since you are so hell bent on being the main character, you get to present your patient first. And please,” she leans in, voice sharp. “don’t skip over the part where you decided to tell a woman with a stroke that it was all in her head.” Her words are laced with frustration and a hint of anger. “In case you weren’t aware, misogyny has no place on my team.”  </p><p>Billy swallows hard. “I didn’t mean..I just…” he stammers. </p><p>Rio raises a hand to stop him. “I’m not looking for excuses. I’m looking for change.” </p><p>Billy nods then begins with a shaky voice. “Mrs. Jones is a 63 year old female with a past medical history of…”</p><p>The rounds drag on, Rio quizzing them on their clinical reasoning and presentation skills. Every so often, she throws in a mini-lecture about the medical topic relevant to their cases. Right now, she’s discussing Agatha’s liver failure patient. </p><p>Rio is drawing the complex biliary tract out on a spare piece of paper when she looks up at her small crowd. Of course, Agatha is staring at the ends of her hair, brow furrowed as she picks at the split ends. </p><p>“Agatha, are you even listening?” Rio asks. </p><p>“Although most people think alcohol is the most common cause of liver disease in the US, but nonalcoholic fatty liver is quickly surpassing it.” Agatha answers without looking up. “These are medical student level questions. I thought this was supposed to be hard.” She wiggles an eyebrow at Rio. </p><p>Rio is taken back. Despite her cool attitude, Agatha is sharp. The fact that she can rattle off the latest statistics shows she’s been doing some serious reading. </p><p>“I’m….impressed.” Rio admits, surprised.  </p><p>“I can be very impressive, Dr. Vidal,” Agatha practically purrs. </p><p>Billy mutters “oh shit” under his breath, his mouth hanging open. “Told you!” He whispers loudly to Alice, his face a mix of awe and disbelief. </p><p>“Moving on.” Rio does her best to ignore the unexpected heat rising in his cheeks. The other interns are staring intently at her, waiting for a reaction. </p><p>She clears her throat for the second time and shifts her focus back to the schedule. “Remember we’ve got a night shift in a couple of weeks.” The collective groans from the group fill the same space. </p><p>“Alright, you’re dismissed. Finish your charting for the day and I’ll see you tomorrow.” Rio stands, gathering her papers. She rushes out of the room before the interns have a chance to make her lose her composure. Again. </p><p>—</p><p>As the day finally comes to a close, Rio presses the down button on the elevator on the sixth floor. Fatigue settles into her shoulders, weighing down her upper back. The fluorescent hospital lights seem sharper now, too bright against her tired eyes. She just wants to go home and sink into a hot shower until she’s half asleep. Dropping her head, she rubs the back of her her neck, kneading the ache from long hours on her feet.</p><p>The elevator doors slide open and she steps in, grateful it’s empty. She steps inside, moving to the back wall, crossing her arms. </p><p>Just before the doors close, a hand, a perfectly manicured hand, stops the doors. Behind it, Agatha slips inside the elevator. She looks exhausted. But it’s not unexpected - it’s her first day. Her hair is now tied up in a loose ponytail, stray hairs framing her face. Her mascara has just the slightest smudge below her eyelashes. But she says nothing. She just exhales, deep and heavy, and stands in the middle of the elevator. </p><p>Rio has 5 floors. Five floors alone with Agatha in this impossibly small space. She should do nothing. She should say nothing. She should shut down any flirting between them. She should…</p><p>The elevator starts its descent. </p><p>Rio shifts forward with one step toward her. </p><p>5th floor. </p><p>Agatha takes a slow breath, then exhales through pursed lips.</p><p>4th floor. </p><p>Agatha reaches behind her, pulling the elastic tie out of her hair. It spills down her back, long, impossibly long. Rio is instantly enveloped in the scent of sandalwood and vanilla. </p><p>3rd floor. </p><p>Rio takes another step. Just a small one. And she’s square with Agatha’s back. Her fingers find the middle of her back, ghosting upward on her spine. Her hair floats over Rio’s fingers. </p><p>2nd floor. </p><p>Agatha lets out the faintest, breathy moan at the contact and Rio feels her heart pull in her chest. She wants to lean in, brush her lips over her neck, follow that path up to her jawline. To her mouth. Feel Agatha sigh into her. Agatha leans back into her more. Her chin tilting up. </p><p>First floor. </p><p>The elevator lets out its final “ding” as the doors open. Rio takes one step back, shoving her hands into her white coat pockets, as Agatha steps out without turning around. For a second, Rio wants to follow her. Her body is screaming at her to move - to continue out of doors out of the hospital, away from prying eyes and security cameras. But her mind, the small logical piece of it left, pushes to the forefront. That piece keeps her feet firmly planted against the linoleum floor of the elevator until the doors close again. Only then does she move, two small steps forward, to push the ‘doors open’ button. They slide open to the first floor once again.</p><p>Agatha has already left. </p><p>Rio reaches the conference room without further incident, pausing only to text a reminder to her interns: Sign off all patient charts before the end of the day.</p><p>Emoji responses start to roll in - thumbs-ups, salutes, even a skull. She chooses to believe they all understand. Or so she hopes.</p><p>By the time she steps out of the hospital, the sun is low, casting sharp streaks of gold across the parking lot. The glare off the cars makes it hard to see too far ahead, but she can just make out a figure leaning against her driver’s side door.</p><p>She doesn’t need to get closer to know who it is.</p><p>“How did you know this was my car?”</p><p>Agatha tilts her head, the hint of a smirk playing at her lips. “I told you, I’m very impressive. And observant.”</p><p>Rio arches a skeptical brow.</p><p>“I saw you leaving the BBQ.” Agatha answers before Rio asks further. A beat, then she adds, “So… are we going to talk about how you just smelled my hair back there?”</p><p>The bluntness catches Rio off guard. A sharp hit, leaving her exposed in a way she doesn’t like.</p><p>Every instinct tells her to retreat. To slip into the car, shut the door, and drive away without answering. But Agatha is blocking her escape. </p><p>“You followed me into that elevator.” Rio almost wants to laugh at her own poor excuse to defend herself. </p><p>“I actually wanted to ask for a ride home.” Instead of fighting her back, Agatha pivots. Again. Rio realizes this is a theme with her. </p><p>“One of the other interns can’t help you out?” Rio fetches her keys from her bag. </p><p>Agatha just shrugs, offering nothing more in the way of an explanation, as she sidesteps out of the way of the driver’s side door. </p><p>“Where do you live?” Rio sighs, unlocking the door. </p><p>Agatha opens her mouth to answer, but a voice from across the parking lot comes drifting over, calling her name. </p><p>Rio glances over to see none other than Evanora Harkness making her way toward the pair, sharp heels clicking across the asphalt. </p><p>Rio straightens her spine and takes a step back. Away from Agatha. Even though they weren’t standing that close each other to begin with. </p><p>“Agatha.” The voice comes again, sharp and warning. “It’s time to go.” She comes to stop in front of the pair. Her eyes take in Rio, a judgmental up and down look. </p><p>Rio glances over at Agatha. She suddenly looks so small, her face fallen a bit. Defeated. She starts to follow quietly before turning to Rio and offering a purse lipped smile and a shrug. </p><p>“I’ll see you tomorrow then. Great work today, Agatha.” She tries to offer her something appreciative to her, knowing she’s going home with that.</p><p>Evanora stops suddenly then turns slowly back around to Rio. </p><p>“You’re her attending this month?” She questions. Rio can’t tell if it’s general inquiry or accusatory. Whatever it is, it doesn’t feel friendly. </p><p>“Dr. Vidal, I’m a hospitalist.” She sticks out her hand but Evanora doesn’t shake it. </p><p>“Huh. Interesting.” She places a hand on Agatha’s shoulder and appears to squeeze it, pushing her forward. “Come.” </p><p>As she follows Evanora, shoulders slumped, she glances back at Rio with a sad sort of look. </p><p>Rio climbs into her car before grabbing her cell phone and sending a quick message to Agatha. </p><p><em>You text me if you ever need anything. No questions asked</em>. </p><p>She knows it’s blurring the lines. And right now, she doesn’t care. She suddenly feels like she has to get Agatha away from that woman. Somehow. </p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio wakes up three times that night. The first time, she tells herself it was just to make sure the interns had finished their charting for the day. To her surprise, all their notes were completed and properly signed.</p><p>The second time, she gets up for a glass of water before sitting back in bed, staring at her phone as if it might suddenly alert her to something — though she had no idea what. There is no work-related reason to be awake. Instead, she opens Facebook and types in Agatha’s name.</p><p>Scrolling through, she realizes how much she was dating herself. Of course, Agatha doesn’t have a Facebook. Instagram turns up nothing under her name. Neither did TikTok. Of course, the CEO’s daughter was smart enough not to use her real name online.</p><p>After an hour of doomscrolling, she finally drifts back to sleep. But her dreams are anything but restful.</p><p>She dreams she is in the hospital; but it’s an endless, twisting maze. Somehow, she has hundreds of patients to see, and the day is already slipping away. She is frantically running from room to room, but no one seems to be in the room they are supposed to be in. </p><p>She crosses the threshold into another dimly lit patient room. A figure lay still in the bed. The face is hard to make out, so she steps closer; her movements quiet, almost cautious. At first, she thinks the patient must be sleeping, but their body is too still, too rigid.</p><p>She hovers over the figure, heart pounding, and turns to see the face. Evanora.</p><p>A cold dread spreads through her, like ice in her veins. Rio raises a trembling hand, fingers hovering over the neck, searching for a pulse.</p><p>Evanora’s eyes shoot open. Dark, unforgiving pupils lock into hers. Her hand shoots out, snatching Rio’s wrist. The grip is firm and unforgiving, causing Rio to wince as nails dig into her skin, </p><p>“Leave. Her. Alone.” Evanora hisses, gritting her teeth. </p><p>Rio’s eyes snap open. She wakes up in a cold sweat, her heart racing and her sheets are twisted around her legs. </p><p>Fuck. </p><p>She lay there for a moment, staring at the ceiling, trying to slow her breathing. It was just a dream. A stupid, stress-induced dream. But the image of Evanora’s dead, soulless eyes was still burned into the backs of her eyelids.</p><p>Rubbing her eyes a final time, she grabs the phone by the side table to look at the time. 5am. Her alarm won’t go off for another thirty minutes. She considers closing her eyes again, but the thought of slipping back into that dream makes her stomach twist. </p><p>With a sigh, she tosses the covers off and swings her legs out of bed. Might as well be up.</p><p>Now, as Rio climbs out of the shower, feeling mildly better as the dream is now pushed further into the recesses of her mind, her phone buzzes. </p><p>
<em>Can you bring me an iced latte with oat milk?</em>
</p><p>Rio groans. Leave it to Agatha to completely abuse what she meant by texting her if she needed anything. She types out a reply. </p><p><em>Doctor’s lounge coffee is free</em>. </p><p>Rio has already been accused of favoritism. She sure as hell isn’t showing up with coffee for just one of them. Her phone buzzes almost instantly with a response:</p><p>
<em>But it tastes so nasty 😩</em>
</p><p>She swears she can hear the whine in Agatha’s voice through the text. </p><p><em>You know, you are kinda a princess</em>. </p><p>It takes mere seconds before Rio’s phone buzzes again. </p><p>
<em>Ohhh Dr. Vidal. Call me princess again and I’ll come.</em>
</p><p>Rio nearly drops her phone. What the fuck? Agatha usually toes the line but this was fifty feet beyond it. </p><p>Her thumb hovered over the screen, ready to type out “what the hell is wrong with you?” Because she can’t have evidence like this in writing. </p><p>But evidence of what? There is nothing going on. Nothing has happened. </p><p>Yet.</p><p>No, nothing can happen - she reminds herself when her phone dings again.</p><p><em>Sorry! I hit send too soon. I meant I’ll come in early every day this week.</em> </p><p>She doesn’t believe her. </p><p><em>I don’t believe you.</em> She pens back.</p><p>And Agatha leaves her on read. </p><p>And that’s how Rio ends up walking into her second day with her new interns, holding a drink carrier full of overpriced custom iced coffees for each one of them. At least this way no one could accuse her of showing Agatha special treatment. And they all get more caffeine out of the deal.</p><p>“This isn’t going to become a habit,” Rio grumbles as she hands out the drinks to Alice, Agatha, and Billy.</p><p>“You’re welcome,” Agatha gushes to the others like she’d personally made it happen.</p><p>“I paid,” Rio shoots back. “And if I recall, you promised to come in early the rest of the week.”</p><p>“Anything you want, Dr. Vidal,” Agatha purrs, dragging out her name like it was a secret between them.</p><p>Billy raises an eyebrow.</p><p>Rio scrambles to make it sound less scandalous. “She just offered if I brought coffee. Nothing exciting.” Rio flicks the air like she’s brushing away the idea. “Now let’s get down to business. Today you take on more patients. All your patients from yesterday are still here, let’s add a few more. Work hard not to get their labs or medications confused. For the love of God, don’t make me the attending that has patient death on day 2.” </p><p>Billy’s eyebrow stays raised. “No pressure, then.”</p><p>—</p><p>Rio doesn’t want to call it a “quiet” day at work. Because anyone who’s ever worked in healthcare knows, if you say the word “quiet” in the hospital, it will jinx the entire day. </p><p>But, so far, the day has gone unusually well. No screaming patients. No one has tried to die. And, surprisingly, Agatha has kept to herself and her work.</p><p>Rio walks into the doctor’s lounge, lunch in hand, relieved to finally get a full meal during work hours. She wasn’t going to say it was because it had been “quiet” today though. No way.</p><p>The lounge was sparsely populated, spare for a few attendings scattered around. One was slouched in a LazyBoy chair, watching the news, while others were either charting at the scattered computers or scrolling through their phones with cafeteria food in hand.</p><p>Rio takes a seat in the back corner at one of the high-top tables. She feels like she has a moment to breathe. Grabbing her phone, she opens it, ready to scroll through the news or social media. Anything, really, to dissociate from the hospital for a second.</p><p>She scoops a spoonful of mac and cheese into her mouth and opens her emails. One of her favorite fanfics has been updated. Perfect.</p><p>Luckily, she’s got her back to the wall and about 45 minutes to kill so she starts reading, diving headfirst into the story of a Hollywood director and her superstar. It’s hot, too hot to read at the hospital. But, her scrubs are a dark color today and before long she’s squirming in her seat as the pair enters the Los Feliz mansion. </p><p>She’s so engrossed she doesn’t register the footsteps coming near her, or the chair being pulled out next to her. </p><p>“Whatcha reading?” Comes Agatha’s voice to her left, just over her shoulder. She’s close enough that her hair cascades onto Rio’s shoulder. </p><p>“Jesus Christ!” Rio jumps, hitting the locking button as she slams her phone down on the table. “You scared me.” </p><p>“I just wanted to come have lunch with my favorite attending,” Agatha says, taking a seat next to Rio, her plate full of very plain looking salad. </p><p>“I’m the only attending you’ve had.”</p><p>“Still my favorite.” Agatha smirks at Rio, stabbing her lettuce with a fork. “So, what were you so engrossed in over here?”</p><p>Before Rio can react, Agatha grabs her phone off the table, holding it close to her chest like it’s a prize.</p><p>“It’s none of your business,” Rio snaps, immediately reaching out to reclaim it.</p><p>But Agatha’s grip is tight, and the phone is pressed too close to her chest. As Rio leans forward to take it back, Agatha turns her body to shield it, trying to block her with an almost playful movement. Instead of grabbing the phone, Rio’s hand brushes against Agatha’s breast as she turns.</p><p>Agatha gasps audibly, and Rio jerks her hand back like she’s been burned. Does she pretend it didn’t happen? Apologize? Make a crude joke? Awkwardness falls over the table while Rio is arguing with herself. </p><p>She looks over at Agatha to see her swiping at the phone now, plugging in passwords in an attempt to open it. </p><p>“Excuse me! Hand it back,” Rio commands, sticking out her hand like a mom asking a child for a toy. </p><p>“I tried 6969 and that didn’t work,” Agatha muses. “So what password would Dr.Vidal pick?” Rio watches in vain as she punches in 0000 and the phone unlocks for her. “God, how old are you? Who uses that as a password anymore?”</p><p>Rio groans and half heartedly reaches for the phone again. Agatha once again turns her back to Rio. Now Rio can see her eyes growing wide, the phone still displaying Rio’s reading from earlier. </p><p>“You know this is basically porn,” Agatha raises an eyebrow at her. </p><p>“It’s reading! And it has a plot,” Rio protests. </p><p>Agatha chuckles. “There is a great vampire one by the way.” She leans in close to Rio. So close that Rio can feel little puffs of air on her cheek as she speaks. “I think you’d find it <em>very interesting</em>. I’ll send it to you.”</p><p>Rio exhales, leaning back in her chair. “This isn’t a good idea, you know.”</p><p>“What? Me sending you porn? I mean sophisticated reading.” </p><p>“You. Hanging out with me. Like this.” Rio gestures between them. “Your mother clearly wouldn’t approve.”</p><p>“My mother has never set foot in these hospital halls.”   </p><p>“Doesn’t mean she doesn’t know what goes on in them,” Rio warns. </p><p>Agatha purses her lips like she knows Rio is correct and returns to her salad. It’s then Rio realizes Agatha is still palming her phone.</p><p>“Are you going to give that back?” Rio asks, her voice tight as the phone buzzes in Agatha’s hand.</p><p>“In a second,” Agatha replies, unfazed. “Gotta see who’s texting you in the middle of a workday. Boyfriend? Girlfriend?” She unlocks the phone again, her eyes scanning the screen. “Ugh. It’s just Billy. Says he’s almost done with his notes since it’s been so quiet today.”</p><p>Rio drops her forehead onto the table with a groan. “Fuck, he shouldn’t have said that.”</p><p>The shrill of several pagers ringing comes through at the same time the overhead speaker crackles, an announcement coming through.</p><p>
<em>“Code Blue room 3614. Code Blue room 3614.”</em>
</p><p>“That’s, that’s my patient,” Agatha says frantically, her voice laced with panic. She nearly falls off her high top chair in a rush to get to her feet. “I…I haven’t done this before. I’m not ready.”</p><p>Rio’s heart races a little faster but she doesn’t hesitate. She stands quickly, locking eyes with Agatha. “Yes you are. I’ll be right next to you the entire time.” <br/><br/></p><p>Rio grabs their plates and tosses them in the trash as they make their way out the door. She ushers them away from the elevator, muttering “the stairs are faster,” as they begin their ascent to the third floor. Agatha grabs her ACLS card out of her white coat pocket, trying to recite the algorithm as they go.</p><p>They reach the room quickly, the large amount of hospital staff there spills out from the small space into the hallway. </p><p>Whatever hesitation Agatha had felt in the doctor’s lounge either melted away or she was hiding it like an Oscar-winning actress, because Rio watches her enter the room with the poise of someone who’s done this a thousand times.</p><p>The room is organized chaos. One nurse is frantically doing chest compressions, a line of two others wait diligently behind her to take her place when she fatigues. </p><p>“I’m Dr. Harkness. This is my patient. I need to know what happened,” Agatha commands, stepping to the foot of the bed with a clinical authority Rio hadn’t expected from someone so green. Her hands are shoved into her coat pockets. Rio takes a step back, scanning the vitals in case Agatha needs any help.</p><p>Agatha listens intently as the patient’s nurse reviews the case, her hands trembling slightly at her notes. Agatha instantly asks for how many doses of epinephrine the patient has received and when the last dose was. </p><p>She correctly asks for another dose. </p><p>It’s impressive, to say the least. Rio can’t remember any intern being able to step up to this level on day two. <em>Great, her ego will only get bigger</em>, Rio briefly thinks. </p><p>But as the oxygen saturation drops, Rio is about to speak up, fearing Agatha might miss it. The respiratory therapist starts to look at Rio nervously, furrowing her brow and pursing her lips. She glares at Agatha and Rio knows she’s about to speak up. </p><p>“I’m going to intubate,” Agatha announces, her tone rising, the sharp edge of panic starting the bleed through. She flicks a brief look to Rio as if asking permission. She nods back subtly, walking with her to the head of the bed. Rio grabs the few supplies Agatha needs, laying them out within reach. </p><p>Agatha grips the glidescope handle, positioning it as she lifts the patient’s chin, opening the airway. </p><p>“I can’t visualize the cords,” Agatha starts to sound a bit frantic, the panic setting in more. To her right, the respiratory therapist flinches like she’s getting agitated with the rookie moves. </p><p>“Just slow down,” Rio coaches, trying to reassure her, “pull back a little bit more,” Rio reassures her. She leans closer, trying to get more of a visual on what Agatha sees. </p><p>Rio’s shoulder brushes against Agatha’s. She doesn’t move. She just presses further into her. Agatha doesn’t move away. </p><p>The scent of vanilla clings to Agatha’s hair and suddenly invades Rio’s nostrils, clashing with the sterile smell of the hospital. </p><p>Rio watches a stray hair cling to Agatha’s temple. She notices the subtle caramel highlights framing her face. </p><p><em>Do not think of how good her hair smells over a dead body,</em> Rio thinks. Who the fuck turns death into something erotic? </p><p>Agatha finally threads the tube between the vocal cords and into the trachea, while Rio is lost in her own little seductive world. </p><p>As the CO2 detector flashes from yellow to purple, Agatha lets out a breath of relief. “Tube’s in.” The respiratory therapist connects the bag to deliver a breath.</p><p>Rio forces herself to shake off the distraction, stepping back to the foot of the bed. The code continues with more rounds of epinephrine, compressions, fluids. Thirty-five minutes of controlled chaos. And then, a heartbeat. It’s weak and irregular. But there.</p><p>A collective exhale moves through the room, then the weight of the situation settles heavy across everyone’s shoulders. Agatha leans back to scrub a hand down her face as people start to shuffle out. </p><p>Rio watches her. Agatha hesitates as the crowd squeezes through the small doorway, then suddenly moves faster, her footsteps weaving through the crowd. She doesn’t linger for the debrief like she’s supposed to. She doesn’t glance back at the patient or review the monitor again. She bolts. </p><p>Without a word, Rio follows, lengthening her stride a bit to try to catch up to Agatha’s retreating figure. Down the hallway. Speeding down the stairwell. </p><p>“Agatha?” Rio questions, hopping down the stairs after her. </p><p>She doesn’t hear her. Or ignores her. Rio isn’t sure which.</p><p>Agatha pushes through the side door and disappears outside. Rio speeds after her, the door slamming shut behind her. </p><p>Rio rounds a corner of the building and almost smacks into Agatha’s back, hunched over with her hands on her knees.</p><p>Rio hears the vomiting start a second later. The sound of liquid hitting the concrete fills the narrow alleyway. </p><p>“It’s ok. You’re ok.” Rio reassures her. She reaches out without thinking, her hand finding Agatha’s back, rubbing slow, grounding circles along her spine. </p><p>Agatha gags once more and coughs before wiping her mouth on the back of her hand. </p><p>“Don’t,” she says, barely audible. She keeps her back to Rio, shoulders rigid. Then, hesitantly, she turns. Her eyes are red, glossy with unshed tears. “She’s still going to die, isn’t she?”</p><p>Rio nods. “She’s 85, Agatha. She was without oxygen for a while. The human body can handle a lot. But sometimes we don’t prevent death, we just fight it off for a little while longer.”</p><p>Agatha seems to absorb that. She breathes out, and something shifts behind her expression. “We can’t fight death.” She comes face to face with Rio now, their bodies inches apart. </p><p>Agatha’s eyes soften, so much it almost hurts to look at her. </p><p>Rio doesn’t think, she doesn’t pause. She raises her hands up to cup Agatha’s face gently, her fingers brushing the edges of her hair. For a second, she just holds her like that. Out here in the back alley of the hospital, the cold is biting at them, but it’s just the two of them. Rio holds Agatha like she’s some fragile, precious thing. Holding her in a way she knows she shouldn’t. In a way she knows crosses a line that she no longer cares about. </p><p>Agatha parts her lips and she glances at Rio, sighing. </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio warns. “That lady. She isn’t your family.” </p><p>Agatha looks at her with a bit of shock, her eyebrows creasing like she’s in pain. Rio instantly regrets her honesty in a moment that felt so raw, so vulnerable. </p><p>She watches Agatha shake her head slightly, detaching herself from Rio’s grasp. She can feel Agatha’s walls building back up, brick by brick. </p><p>And then just like that, Agatha is walking away, back toward the job where Rio is her superior. Back to the world where none of this is allowed to exist. </p><p>— </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio takes the long way back into the hospital. She doesn’t want to risk running into Agatha again. </p><p>It’s been two days since this all started. Two fucking days since Agatha walked into the hospital, into her life, apparently intent on ruining it. </p><p>Rio’s built a reputation as a solid attending here. The residents like her, the nurses like her. Hell even most patients like her. </p><p>Then Agatha waltzes in that first day wearing shorts entirely too short. And suddenly Rio is thinking about touching what’s under the shorts. </p><p>And then she’s actually putting her hands in the girl’s hair. </p><p>A girl 20 years her junior. </p><p>She is royally fucked. </p><p>So she walks into the conference room hoping, by the grace of God, Agatha isn’t in it. </p><p>No such luck. </p><p>Agatha’s got her head down, forehead resting on the table and she doesn’t bother looking up as Rio walks in.</p><p>For a split second, Rio wants to run her hand along Agatha’s back. Soothe her and tell her it’s all ok. For what? She’s not sure. It’s ok she held her in the courtyard when she knows she shouldn’t? It’s ok her patient is dying? It’s ok that Agatha freaked the fuck out after her first code?</p><p>But there is Billy, as present as ever, typing away on his laptop like a guard dog. </p><p>He gives Rio a look when she enters that’s somewhere between shame and disbelief. She wonders how much he knows. </p><p>Thank fuck the day is almost done. </p><p>“Let’s all meet in here in an hour to run the list,” Rio announces like she had an actual purpose for entering the room in the first place. </p><p>“What’s ’run the list’?” Billy asks. Agatha doesn’t move from her spot against the table. </p><p>“Review all the patients for the day and go over what you need to tell the night team about them. Make sure Alice is here too.” She pauses. “Agatha? Are you hearing me?”</p><p>Agatha gives a thumbs up without lifting her head. </p><p>Satisfied enough, Rio retreats to her office across the hall to gather her things - and her thoughts. She closes the door behind her and exhales slowly, dragging a hand over her face. Then she powers down her laptop, sliding it into her shoulder bag along with her phone and water bottle.</p><p>Since she plans to leave right after the review with the interns, she decides there’s no reason to stay in her scrubs. She might as well change.</p><p>She kicks off her shoes, then peels off her scrub pants and pulls on a pair of sweats. Next, she turns around and grabs the hem of her scrub top and starts tugging it over her head.</p><p>That’s when she hears it.</p><p>The door creaks open behind her.</p><p>Of course. In her rush, she forgot to lock it.</p><p>“Dr. Vidal?” Agatha’s voice comes fluttering toward her from the doorway. “Oh. Sorry. I…” </p><p>From under her shirt she hears the door click again and she assumes Agatha left, shutting the door behind her. She finishes stripping off the remainder of her shirt, until only her deep green bra remains. Rio turns toward the door, intent on grabbing her shirt from the desk. </p><p>“Agatha!” Rio yelps. Agatha didn’t leave. Of course she didn’t. Instead she’s standing there. Her back leaning against the closed door, arms crossed. She’s got a coy smirk tugging at her lips.</p><p>Rio should feel self-conscious. She should grab her shirt and throw it on. Or cover herself with her hands. </p><p>But in that moment, something changes. Like the heat rises in the room; like two magnets in proximity with one another. Rio looks right into Agatha’s eye, raising an eyebrow. Silent. Suddenly it feels like a challenge of who will back down first. </p><p>Agatha was the one who walked in. But she doesn’t flinch. Doesn’t apologize. Her eyes move slowly, dragging down Rio’s body like she’s drinking her in. She studies the hollow of her throat, her collarbones, down to the swell of her breasts. Her eyes linger along the thin lace of Rio’s bra. </p><p>And the cold of the hospital isn’t reason Rio’s nipples are hard against the fabric. </p><p>Agatha’s eyes snap back up to Rio’s and Rio expects another sarcastic smirk from her.</p><p>But instead Agatha’s pupils are wide, her lips parted, her cheeks flush. </p><p>She’s fucking turned on. </p><p>Rio takes two steps toward her until she invades her space. She can feel the heat radiating off both of them. She bites her lip, then lets her gaze drop, just for a moment, to Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>Agatha’s breath catches. Rio watches the subtle movement of her throat as she swallows hard, her breathing growing shallower with every inch of proximity.</p><p>Finally, Rio feels like she has the upper hand. </p><p>She’s so close she could just tilt her head, barely move, and kiss her. The temptation is razor-sharp, just beneath the surface, pulsing with potential. She doesn’t want to think about the consequences. Not right now.</p><p>“You should…really…lock your door,” Agatha whispers, the words coming out in short bursts. </p><p>Rio lets the words linger in the air, a hint of a smirk tugging at the corner of her mouth.</p><p>“Maybe you should knock,” she murmurs, her voice low, deliberate.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flash with surprise at the comeback before something darker threads through it. But she doesn’t move. Neither of them does.</p><p>The space between them feels thinner than air now and Rio swears she can hear Agatha’s heart racing even from there; unless it’s her own. </p><p>“Was there something you needed, Agatha?” Rio murmurs, her voice soft, breathy, trembling on the edge of a dare.</p><p>Wrong move.</p><p>Agatha steps back - slow, calculated. Her tongue pushes against the inside of her cheek as she lets her gaze trail deliberately downward, eyes locking onto Rio’s nipples poking against the lace. </p><p>“I think I’ve got everything I came for,” she says with a low chuckle, her eyes never lifting.</p><p>Then she turns and walks out, leaving the door open behind her.</p><p>Rio clenches her fists at her sides, jaw tight. Agatha is maddening. Every time she thinks she’s found footing, the younger woman flips the ground beneath her. It’s a constant tug-of-war with control, deflection, heat and Agatha never lets her forget it.</p><p>She wants to hate it.</p><p>But she really doesn’t.</p><p>Rio slams the office door shut and this time she locks it, throwing her t-shirt over her head. She takes a long drink of water, trying to flush the heat from her face and from everywhere else. </p><p>Focus. Reset. Just ten more minutes, she tells herself. Then she can go home.</p><p>By the time she steps out five minutes later, patient list in hand, her pulse has mostly settled. She keeps her eyes on the paper as she joins the team.</p><p>Everyone is eager to wrap up for the day so they move quickly through the list. Until they get to Agatha’s patient, the one they coded earlier today.</p><p>Rio scans the notes, then looks up. “Final order of business. Agatha, you need to give the night team a head’s up about your patient. You don’t want them to be surprised when a nurse calls them that she passed away.”</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrows. “That’s it?”</p><p>Rio nods. “That’s it.”</p><p>“They don’t really know her though.”</p><p>“That’s ok. These things happen, they can declare death. You get sent the death certificate to sign via email in a couple of days.” Rio says matter-of-factly. </p><p>Agatha doesn’t respond right away.</p><p>“That’s not what I meant,” she says finally, quieter. “She doesn’t have any family. She’s just... alone. In that room.”</p><p>“You aren’t obligated to stay. Your shift ends at 7,” Rio begins, then hesitates when she sees the uncertainty in Agatha’s eyes. “That being said, no one will fault you for it.”</p><p>Agatha nods slowly, looking down at her hands. She starts picking at her thumbnail.</p><p>“Yeah. I think I’ll stay,” she says. “I mean...I know the nurses are short-staffed. So really, I’m just helping them out.”</p><p>She adds the last part like she needs to justify it - to Rio, maybe, or to herself.</p><p>Rio nods. She gets it - feeling invested, attached to a patient you spent some much time with. You want to see it through, even to the end. </p><p>As Agatha slips out of the conference room and heads down the hall toward her patient’s room, Rio returns to her office. She could go home. She should go home. It’s Agatha’s decision to stay.</p><p>But something tugs at her. </p><p>She tells herself it’s about being a good attending. That it’s professional oversight for her intern. That she’s just making herself available if Agatha needs anything.</p><p>But she knows better.</p><p>It’s not the doctor in her that’s lingering. It’s something else. The way Agatha softened. The way she stayed. The way it makes her feel more human, less untouchable. It pulled at something in Rio that she doesn’t usually let anyone get close enough to touch. And something she doesn’t think Agatha lets others touch either.</p><p>So she stays too.</p><p>One coffee break, a vending machine candy bar, and three hours later, she’s still in her office. The hospital’s gone quiet around her, and no word has come from Agatha. Not from the nurses either.</p><p>She unlocks her cell phone, setting it on the desk next to her. 10pm. Grabbing the office phone, she dials up to the nurses’ station. Agatha’s patient is still alive but barely. The nurse points out that Agatha’s been in there the entire time. </p><p>“She hasn’t so much as taken a bathroom break. She’s just sitting in there holding her hand.” The nurse notes into the phone. Rio hangs up, leaning back in her desk chair, threading her fingers behind her head. </p><p>Rio can’t leave. Not now. </p><p>You don’t forget that first death as a doctor. The names might fade over the years, the faces blurred, but you never forget that feeling. Watching them slip away, powerless to help, when all you’ve been training for, all you’ve been working for all those years - is to try to save them. You never forget the stillness of the room after. The silence that envelops everything when it’s really, finally over. </p><p>So Rio waits. </p><p>Another 45 minutes go by and Rio hears shuffling in the conference room. She rises from her chair and goes out to meet Agatha, eyes rimmed red. </p><p>“It gets easier, doesn’t it?” Agatha asks quietly. Suddenly, she seems so small, so vulnerable. </p><p>“Sometimes it does,” Rio replies. “But some deaths will always hit you harder than others.”</p><p>Agatha looks up, uncertain.</p><p>“That’s a good thing,” Rio adds. “It means you’re still human.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a soft chuckle, wiping her eyes with the back of her hand. She brushes her hair out of her eyes while straightening her back. Like she’s pushing the reset button on her emotions. </p><p>“I’m fine now. It’s over,” she says clinically as she reaches for her coat, gathering her things.</p><p>“Come on,” Rio says, heading for the door. “We’re getting ice cream.”</p><p>“Ice cream? I know I’m young, but I’m not a kid.”</p><p>“Are you saying you don’t like ice cream?”</p><p>Agatha gives a little smirk. “No, I do.”</p><p>“I’m driving,” Rio says as they step out of the conference room. “But you’re buying.”</p><p>They walk together toward Rio’s car.</p><p>“So why ice cream?” Agatha asks. “Why not, I don’t know...booze?”</p><p>“In the fire department, there’s a tradition,” Rio says. “Your first fire, first time on the news, first anything - you owe the team ice cream.”</p><p>“Kinda morbid now,” Agatha gives her a disgusted look. </p><p>“Hey now. Everything's better with ice cream.” Rio chuckles, before her face grows more serious, remembering. “My dad was a fire captain for 20 years. I used to go on ride alongs with him. They even made me buy ice cream my first time.” </p><p>Agatha shrugs at the response, like it’s not a big deal. But as Rio looks over at her, she can see a hint of a smile. </p><p>—</p><p>“What is that monstrosity you picked?” Agatha asks. “Why does it look like a dog?”</p><p>“It’s a Snoopy ice cream bar! How could you not know Snoopy?” Rio snaps back playfully. </p><p>They are leaning against the food of Rio’s car now, ice creams in hand. Luckily, the July night is still warm, the heat from the day still clinging to the humid air. </p><p>“God, you need to get laid.” Agatha says casually, bringing another spoonful to her mouth. </p><p>Rio’s head snaps up at the comment before a wicked idea crosses her mind. </p><p>“Why, are you offering?” She offers back. She expects to catch Agatha off guard with her quip. </p><p>But she should have known better. </p><p>Agatha doesn’t respond. Instead she leans down toward Rio. </p><p>For a second, Rio isn’t sure if she’s going to lean over and kiss her or snap her teeth at her. Instead, Agatha continues to lean down, her eyes never leaving Rio’s. She bends down even further then, her tongue darting out to lick the entire length of Rio’s ice cream. </p><p>“Tastes good,” she purrs.</p><p>Rio can’t help but stare at a small drop of vanilla on Agatha’s lip. Just begging to be touched.</p><p>“You’ve got a…” Rio gestures to her lip.</p><p>Agatha wipes the side of her mouth. </p><p>“No, it’s right…” Rio gestures again.</p><p>Agatha wipes her chin this time and now Rio swears she’s missing it on purpose. “Would you?” Agatha asks, scooting closer to Rio before tilting her chin up. </p><p>Rio swallows hard. Every interaction with Agatha feels like a bomb she’s trying hard to keep from detonating. And now Agatha’s seen her half-naked, although accidentally. Hell she’s held her face in her hands. Why does this feel more intimate? Because it’s more purposeful? Like a line they are crossing that can’t be taken back? </p><p>Rio brings her right index finger up to Agatha’s lip, slowly. Agatha opens her mouth to the touch, as if the motion is too familiar; an instinct. Just waiting for Rio to press her finger inside. </p><p>Instead Rio wipes the vanilla from her lip, the white liquid gathering on the tip of her finger.  </p><p>In a flash, Agatha snatches Rio’s wrist, drawing her finger up to her mouth. She licks down the sides of her finger before sucking it into her mouth, pressing her tongue flat along the tip. The sensation is too much. It shoots straight to Rio’s core and she has to bite back a moan. </p><p>She squeezes her legs together as Agatha pulls the finger out of her mouth with a pop. She looks entirely too pleased with herself.  </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, this is…” Rio starts to warn. </p><p>Agatha raises her hand to stop her “Whatever you are going to say, don’t.” Agatha bites back. “I’m just helping you out,” she smirks back. </p><p>“Right, sure. Helping.” Rio squeaks out but her brain feels it is running on fumes. She can’t keep doing this - let Agatha get the upper hand and leave her flustered and turned on. For a split second, she thinks about turning the tables. Literally. Pinning Agatha against the roof of that car and shoving her thigh between her legs. Kissing her hard and bringing her to the edge before denying her an orgasm. </p><p>Fuck, her stupid turned on brain. She has to mentally slap herself because she can’t be thinking like this. </p><p>Flirting? Sure. Pushing the flirting a little bit to include touching? Sure. But a sexual relationship? Situationship? Fuck buddies? No. Nope. Nah. <br/><br/>She can’t flush her entire professional career down the toilet for some intern. </p><p>She glances up to see Agatha watching her, studying her face like she’s reading her mind - watching her mentally battle herself. </p><p>“We should…go,” Rio stutters when she finally does manage to speak. <br/><br/>“Whatever you say, doctor,” Agatha watches her for a second longer like she’s waiting for the other shoe to drop. Or Rio to fold. She isn’t sure which.</p><p>Then Agatha hops down from the hood of the car, dropping her remaining ice cream into the trash. </p><p>—</p><p>“You sure it’s ok I’m driving you home?” Rio asks as she turns down the suburban street. </p><p>“That old crone has long since drank herself into a stupor. It will be fine,” Agatha scoffs. “It’s right here.” </p><p>The car slows as Agatha points out the house she shares with her mother. Although Rio can hardly call it a house. It looks like a mansion. The two stories of red brick are accentuated by large white columns along the front. A veranda wraps its way around the front, adorned with outdoor chairs that look largely unused. </p><p>“It’s…” Rio begins. </p><p>“A monstrosity, I know,” Agatha finishes. “My mom liked its history. As a plantation.” Agatha spits out the last words. “I’m moving the second I can.”</p><p>Rio nods in understanding as Agatha unbuckles, reaching for the door handle. </p><p>“Oh hey. Before I go,” Agatha pauses, before opening the passenger’s side door. “My mom says to tell you I have to take tomorrow off.”</p><p>“You don’t really get days off as an intern,” Rio replies, confused.</p><p>“You going to say no to the CEO?” Agatha lifts an eyebrow. “Plus it’s not like I have a choice either.”</p><p>Rio sighs. “I know. I’ll take your patients for the day. You’ll be back the next day?”</p><p>“Oh yeah.” Agatha says nonchalantly. “It’s just this stupid thing my mom wants me to do.” She starts to close the door, shugging. “My wedding dress fitting.”</p><p>And with that she slams the door, walking toward the house. </p><p> </p>

<p>
<span>Rio tells herself she’s not going to think of Agatha at all today. The conference room is quieter without her constant quips and sarcastic comments. She doesn’t miss it. Or her. Because she’s not thinking about her and what she’s doing right now. She’s not thinking about what the hell she meant by “wedding dress fitting.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Engaged. </span>
</p><p>
<span>That would mean Agatha is engaged.</span>
</p><p>
<span>To whom?</span>
</p><p>
<span>And why didn’t she tell her.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Because she’s just using you for a little workplace fun. Or to get ahead in the program. Either way.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Using you. </span>
</em>
<span>She thinks. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Using you.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Where’s Agatha today?” Billy interrupts her thoughts from his seat across from her at the conference room table. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She’s going to kill him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Personal matter,” she shuts down the conversation as fast as she can. Billy gives Alice a look before pulling out his phone, presumably to text Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She could text her too, right? As a mentor…</span>
<em>
<span>Hey, hope the dress fitting is going well. By the way, what the actual fuck? You are engaged?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Ok, maybe not. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So she gets days off and we don’t?” Alice asks. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s out of my hands,” Rio shrugs, turning back to her computer. Without Agatha to chart on her patients today, Rio has a bit more work to get through. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I came in with the flu once as a medical student,” Billy muses to no one in particular. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And your mom isn’t the hospital CEO,” Alice rolls her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glares at her, her eyebrows knit together. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What? Everyone knows. Her mom even gave us a little speech at orientation. Although I can’t say it was inspiring,” Billy cuts in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was vile.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy nods to Alice. “And kinda threatening. I can see why Agatha hates her. She told me once her mom even went so far as to arrange…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice elbows him in the side. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Arrange?! Arrange what</span>
</em>
<span>?!? Rio’s inner voice screams but she says nothing and continues to stare at her computer, the words now blurring together. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nevermind, I shouldn’t have said anything,” he murmurs under his breath. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You can feel free to speak your mind,” Rio lays it on sweetly, hoping he will spill.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not really my place to say,” Billy hesitates, side eyeing Alice as he does. She tenses her jaw at him and shakes her head subtly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We should go see our patients,” Alice adds, ushering him to the door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dammit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How’s it going with the intern?” Natasha asks, taking a sip of her wine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>On a whim, Rio had called her on the drive home, desperate to drown her thoughts in something stronger than silence. Now they sit side by side at the bar, house wine in hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Engaged,” Rio says flatly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, fuck. We need something stronger than wine.” Natasha flags down the bartender and orders two shots of tequila.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio downs hers in one go, then slams the lime on the bar without biting it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ok. So she’s engaged. Like, to a man? A woman?” Natasha questions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No idea,” Rio admits. “I need another one.” She signals for another shot. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So let me get this straight. She just casually drops that she’s engaged and leaves it at that? No explanation?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Basically.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you end things?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There was nothing to end.” Rio waves her hand dismissively, then grabs Natasha’s untouched shot and drinks it too. “We flirted. She’s engaged. Haven’t seen her since.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“When do you see her next?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tomorrow,” Rio sighs. “Which means I need another shot.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha gives her a look. “As much as I support a good spiral, maybe pace yourself a little.” She slides the next round of shots just out of reach. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Absolutely not.” Rio ignores her warnings, leaning on the bar to grab the additional shots. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This isn’t like you to freak out over some fling. Or not fling. Someone you flirted with. So what? She’s someone special then?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rests her head on her hands on the bar. Truth be told, Rio isn’t sure why she’s spiraling. Deep down, nothing can happen between them. She’s Agatha’s boss. The CEO’s daughter. Engaged daughter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s too much to think about. Her head swims, tangled with too much tequila and regret. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha takes the hint and starts rubbing her back slowly in an attempt to soothe her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She lifts her head and mouths “thanks,” ready to drop her forehead back on the bar. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But out of the corner of her eye, she sees a flash of brunette hair enter the bar - hair she swears is familiar. Her stomach drops at the sight, but that doesn’t stop her. She stands quickly, sudden thoughts of confronting her in the forefront of her mind. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s then that the world tilts on his axis below her. She sways, she’s sure it’s only slightly, as she reaches for a nearby chair to help stabilize her. It’s not her fault the chair seems to slip out of her grasp, sending her tumbling…</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, Jesus,” Natasha wraps her arms around her middle, hauling her upright before she hits the floor. “You’re done.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine,” she slurs, again, only slightly. “But Agatha…” she attempts to gesture toward the girl.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha!” She tries to yell out, reaching her direction. The girls slightly around, looking toward the noise. She’s about the right age. The nose isn’t quite right, her eyes not as icy blue and her lips are a touch thinner. But Rio could squint, maybe make it work for tonight.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, you.” Rio slides up next to the brunette. As her friends part the circle a little to allow her in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hi,” the brunette giggles back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio reaches over to grab a strand of brown hair. She misses the first time, swaying slightly on her feet before wrapping her fingers around a lock. She brings it to her nose. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her face scrunches up. She doesn’t smell like Agatha either. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you just smell her hair?” A random blonde in the circle asks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s your name?” Rio ignores the blonde. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Kathryn.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eww.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The brunette looks mildly offended at the remark and swears she slightly steps back from her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are not doing this,” Natasha whispers harshly into Rio’s ear as she comes up beside her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh! This is my friend Natasha!” She wraps her arms around her neck, leaning onto her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have to excuse her. She’s a little drunk.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s 8pm,” one of the friends says disgustedly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Natasha shrugs before hooking her finger into one of Rio’s belt loops and pulling. Rio stumbles backward toward the door as Natasha practically drags her along. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was fucking embarrassing, Rio. Jesus, you are down bad.” Natasha pulls open the bar door, ushering her through it. “Come on. Let’s get you home.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s alarm is especially obnoxious this morning. She swears it can’t possibly be going off at the right time because there is no way she got enough sleep last night. The pounding in her temples starts immediately, a throbbing reminder of just how bad an idea last night was. She groans as she rolls over in bed, her hand slamming on top of her phone in an attempt to stop the clanging noise coming from it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There, beside it, is a bottle of water and two ibuprofen - bless Natasha for thinking ahead. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Thirty minutes later, she’s showered, changed and still fighting a lingering headache and growing nausea as she walks into the call room to greet her interns. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The dark circles under her eyes are barely covered with make-up, her hair tied up in a bun but still damp. Their confused (and somewhat disgusted) looks give away just how rough she must look. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio decides its best to just focus on her shoes - her Converse sneakers peeking out of her scrubs - as she beelines it for the coffee machine. Something, anything, on her empty stomach might help. And she desperately needs the caffeine. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As she pours the lukewarm liquid into a styrofoam cup, she can feel her three interns watching her from the conference table, whispering and nudging each other. The sugar packets are gone and creamer empty so she’s stuck with black coffee today - downing the small cup in two gulps. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Whatever silent battle the interns were having, Alice apparently lost because she speaks up first.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dr. Vidal? Are you ok?” Alice asks hesitantly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Peachy,” Rio offers through gritted teeth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice watches her like she knows she’s lying. Still Rio tries to plaster a fake smile on her face as she turns to grab a refill. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The black coffee on an empty stomach now feels like a mistake. One that’s threatening to come back up. She spins, contemplating how far the bathroom is and how long she has to make it there….instead she doubles over into the nearest trash can, the coffee burning as it comes back up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The room is horrifically silent apart from the splashing sound of her regurgitated coffee against the plastic bag lining the trash can.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wishes someone would say something, anything, to break the awkward tension. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my god, you think she’s pregnant?” Billy whispers, too loud. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Not that. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha actually laughs loudly, apparently amused. That sound makes Rio want to vomit again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s gay,” Agatha answers, flatly. At that, Rio decides to keep her head in the trashcan a little bit longer. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How do you know?” Billy asks, then pauses. His eyes go wide. “Wait, are you two?” He gestures wildly between them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can hear you!” Rio snaps, lifting her head from her vomity safe space. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m engaged, remember?” Agatha deadpans.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Riiiight,” Rio swears she hears Billy draw out the word, to the point where it sounds sarcastic. But then again, he always sounds a little sarcastic. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hurls again into the trash can, this time mostly bile and dry heaves. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going to go get her some water,” Alice offers, gently, making her way toward the door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe we should all go,” she hears Billy counter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she lifts her head from the trash can, she expects to see an empty room, but misfortune seems to favor her today - there is Agatha, still rooted in her spot a few feet from the trash can. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice and Billy still stand at the conference room door, holding it open, waiting. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stands a few feet away, watching with a look that both sad and expectant, like she’s waiting for something. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio should say something. Or ask her to stay, create a make-up task with charting or helping with a patient, just - something to keep her there. Give her an excuse to talk to her…  </span>
</p><p>
<span>She says nothing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha draws in a deep breath and takes two steps forward, toward Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>For a second, Rio holds her breath, unsure of what’s about to happen. But Agatha only reaches past her, to the counter behind Rio, grabbing a napkin. She presses it into Rio’s hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Enjoy your hangover,” she whispers before following her fellow interns. </span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>As the interns round on their patients, Rio bribes a hospital pharmacist for some Zofran. A breakfast burrito, Gatorade and an anti-nausea pill later - she’s feeling less like a gremlin and more human. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There is just one lingering issue. One that keeps popping into her brain as her patients drone on about toe pain they had once 15 years ago…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tells herself she can’t make it obvious she’s mad at Agatha. She can’t really be mad at her, right? It’s not a crime to flirt while engaged. Technically. It’s just bad taste. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And who’s to say they can’t still flirt. Or touch. Or maybe make-out a little…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her thoughts continue to drift as stands rooted at her spot at the nurses station, the chaos of the hospital buzzing around her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She’s lost in her thoughts when a hand lands on her shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She jerks away at the sudden intrusion. “What?” she snaps. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stands there next to her, an inch shorter than her. Her white coat sits just below her hips, scrubs too tight and that damn long ponytail…</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I need help with a paracentesis on a patient,” Agatha says calmly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Go ask a senior resident,” her answer is short. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I did, they are all busy. And I’ve never done one. I need an expert to show me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not my problem.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turns back to the chart she wasn’t even reading. Agatha doesn’t move. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“But…it is your problem,” Agatha tilts her head at her, confused. “You are my attending. It’s your patient too.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine,” Rio grates. “Let’s go get the supplies.” Rio pushes off the counter of the nurses’ station, Agatha following closely behind.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The short walk gives Rio just enough time to decide to ignore the fact that Agatha’s eyes feel like they are boring through her from behind and focus on the actual work. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio enters the code to the supply closet and opens the door, allowing Agatha to enter first. The space is cramped, made smaller by shelves stacked with IV tubing, sterile supplies and patient hygiene kits. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio can smell her stupid perfume hit her nostrils as she scoots by Rio, further into the small closet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Diagnostic or therapeutic?” Rio asks. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha freezes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“For your para. Are you sending the fluid for analysis or just relieving the pressure?” The words come out harsh - full of underlying anger and laced with annoyance of being forced into proximity with Agatha. Maybe she should just say fuck it and confront her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Diagnostic.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio yanks the correct kit off the shelf, shoving it at Agatha’s chest.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rushes past her, her shoulder knocking into Agatha as she makes her way to the door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks…” Agatha mutters under her breath, rubbing her now sore shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They make it to the patient’s room and with quick consent for the procedure, the prep begins. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grabs two procedure gowns, tossing one in Agatha’s direction. Rio is sure Agatha knows how to put it on. She must have done it hundreds of times as a medical student. But suddenly she’s fumbling like she’s never seen the inside of a hospital in her life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can you help me tie it?” Agatha turns her back toward Rio before sweeping her ponytail to the side, exposing the curve of her neck. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t say a word as her fingers grasp the two strings of the gown. She tells herself she will keep her fingers as far away from the bare skin of Agatha’s neck as possible, but still, she’s finding it hard to actually tie it when it isn’t flush against something. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She draws it closer to Agatha’s neck to cinch down the tie. And then accidentally (she swears it was accidental), her fingers brush against the bare skin. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She doesn’t move them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha makes a sharp inhale at the sensation, finching as Rio’s fingers linger just a second too long. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She turns, facing Rio, lips parting slightly. Then her top teeth sink into her bottom lip - just enough, just a touch. A flicker of innocence, or seduction - maybe both. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio feels her frustration growing. She can’t seem to be next to Agatha without her palms itching to touch her. Like a forbidden fruit and Agatha is the damn snake in the Garden of Eden. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t do that.” Rio’s voice is low, strained, but there is a firmness to it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t do anything.” Agatha raises an eyebrow. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio is suddenly acutely aware of where they are, their patient only feet away from them, watching the interaction intently. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We need to get started,” she bites, then turns to their patient, a fake smile plastered on her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha furrows her brow a bit at the harshness of her words, but says nothing. She slips on her sterile gloves, fingers precise, movements smooth as she pulls the necessary supplies from the kit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio settles back into work mode quickly, watching Agatha’s every move - the way she uses the ultrasound to locate the correct spot, how steady her hands are as she numbs the patient’s skin, perfectly extracts the fluid with such confidence. Especially for an intern…then it hits her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shit,” Rio curses under her breath. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn’t falter, she doesn’t pause - her eyes continue to focus in as she finishes the procedure flawlessly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn’t need me, did you?” Rio questions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha strips off her gloves, tossing them into the bin as she finishes. “Who says I didn’t?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You just executed that perfectly. You didn’t even ask me a single question.” Rio’s voice drops, tinged with accusation. “So why am I here, Agatha?” She glares. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because you are my attending.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>An act. It’s all an act. The same act she’s been pulling for a week. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio? She’s been buying it. Hook, line and sinker. Falling for her charm, her glances, the quiet seductions - like a fool. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Meanwhile, Agatha goes home to God-knows-who. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio looks up, Agatha is watching her. Not just looking - but studying her face. Agatha’s blue eyes flicker to her brows, the tension of her jaw - watching her carefully as Rio spirals beneath the surface.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re…you’re mad at me.” It wasn’t a question, but a realization. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio warns, her name heavy on her tongue. “This is hardly the time.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That para was flawless. You know it.” Agatha’s voice is quieter now, searching. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio almost rolls her eyes at the statement, but settles for a scoff.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>It hits Agatha that this is bigger than a simple procedure. “Wait, are you jealous?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No!” Rio snaps, a little too quickly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes light up, almost delighted. “You are. You are jealous!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, we are </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> doing this here.” Rio starts cleaning up the supplies, throwing them in the biohazard bin. </span>
</p><p>
<span>An elderly voice drifts from the bed behind them. “You can keep doing it here, I don’t mind. I’ve been stuck in this bed for a week. At least give me some juicy gossip.” </span>
</p><p><span>“Mrs. Brock,” Rio starts, her professional tone kicking in. “I apologize that my </span><em><span>intern</span></em><span> is</span> <span>being unprofessional.”</span></p><p>
<span>“Oh don’t apologize for her,” Mrs. Brock waves a hand. “She’s adorable. You do seem jealous though, Dr. Vidal. What did sweet Dr. Harkness do to you?”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glares at Agatha. “Now you have patients ganging up on me?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirks, her old confidence slipping back into place. “What can I say? I’m a charmer.” She winks at her patient, now sitting up in the bed listening intently. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Apparently, Mrs. Brock decides now is a good time to play mediator. “But what </span>
<em>
<span>did </span>
</em>
<span>she do, Dr. Vidal?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s cheeks burn hot. She could leave. She should leave. She’s the attending - no one’s holding her hostage. But her feet feel too heavy. She wants to throw up again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She swallows the bile rising in her throat just enough to force out the words. “You lied to me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I did not,” Agatha fires back, too fast. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn’t tell the truth.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn’t ask.” Agatha lifts her chin. “And I’ll have you know. Ralph is very respectable.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ralph?” Rio stares. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Bohner,” Agatha mutters.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So you’re going to be doctor Bohner? Why didn’t you go into urology?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Even Mrs. Brock snorts, “Oh, that is unfortunate, honey.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just shut up ok?” Agatha shoots Mrs. Brock a glare. “You too.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>But as Agatha looks back at Rio, she can see the fight is drained from her face. Agatha doesn’t look like a future bride ready to defend her marriage. She looks…embarrassed, almost fearful. Her eyes dart to the floor, eyes a little too wide, like she’s trying to keep something from fraying, just below the surface. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t see a ring,” and there is Mrs. Brock again, chiming in, apparently undeterred. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t wear it at work,” Agatha says, sheepishly covering her left hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure honey.” She points a gnarled finger at Rio. “So you. Why are you jealous?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio opens her mouth just as the curtain rustles and Billy sticks his head in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh good! Dr. Vidal, I’ve been looking for you. The nurses said you were in here.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come in, dear!” Mrs. Brock says cheerfully, like she’s hosting her own little Grey’s Anatomy episode. “We were just talking about why Dr. Vidal here is jealous of Dr. Harkness’ engagement. Now I think…” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my god, I think I love you for this!” Billy gushes. “And I </span>
<em>
<span>totally</span>
</em>
<span> want to hear more gossip. Seriously, I live for this. But umm…my patient,” he pauses, careful not to reveal too many details in front of another patient. “He’s hypotensive now. I think his last blood pressure was 80/40 and I tried to give fluids but you know he has heart failure so…” He starts rambling. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart rate kicks up just slightly at his words, but her face stays composed. “Lovely to chat with you Mrs. Brock,” a hint of sarcasm in her voice. “We should have your results tomorrow morning.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She pivots and slips out of the room, Billy and Agatha hustling behind her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As they speed-walk down the hospital corridor, Billy leans toward Agatha. “So you finally told her?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhales loudly enough for Rio to hear. “Kinda. But mostly she figured it out on her own. It was…awkward.” She pauses, her voice dropping lower like she hopes Rio doesn’t hear. “I’ll text you about it later.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But did you tell her it’s a sham? That Eva-whora arranged it?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s stomach drops at her words, but she keeps walking, pretending she’s focused on finding Billy’s patient’s room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Behind her, Agatha’s sharp whisper cuts through the hall. “Shhh! Someone will hear you!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Too late.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio heard every word.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But she keeps moving, she doesn’t turn around, doesn’t give herself away.  But her chest is tight now. Her mind is racing, looping the word </span>
<em>
<span>sham</span>
</em>
<span> like it’s suddenly rewritten the last week of her life. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s not real. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was never real. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But…it doesn’t mean it still won’t happen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could go through with it. Her mother clearly has that kind of power. And Agatha - Agatha fears her. That much is obvious now. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They reach the patient’s door and Rio stops in front of it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hesitates behind her, but Rio doesn’t give her a glance. Not a flicker of acknowledgement that she knows anything more. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” she says cool and steady, her eyes on the door handle. “You’re dismissed for the day.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh,” Agatha pauses uncomfortably. “I guess I’ll see you both in a couple of days then,” Agatha offers hesitantly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pushes into the doorway without a further glimpse back in Agatha’s direction. </span>
</p><p>
<span>That’s right, Rio recalls as they enter the next patient room. They finally have a few days off. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then night shift. </span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Night shift is a whole different beast in the hospital. While the rest of the world sleeps, night shift becomes responsible for the entire hospital, not just a select group of patients. There is high stress, little sleep and endless phone calls and emergencies. </p><p>It took a few years, but Rio has her night shift routine down perfectly now. The night before, she stays up as late as she physically can. </p><p>Did you know grocery stores are often open 24 hours? Midnight grocery shopping is a level of peace Rio never knew was possible. </p><p>Then Rio usually sleeps in as late as she can, eats a late lunch/early dinner and takes another nap before going into the hospital at 7pm.</p><p>She brings her favorite energy drink, a comfy pair of slippers and a book for down time in the call room.</p><p>She has her routine down perfectly. </p><p>Well had it down perfectly.</p><p>Until now. </p><p>Because now there is Agatha - bright eyed and sharp tongued and invading every aspect of her being. Every time she closes her eyes she sees Agatha watching her, biting her lip, feigning innocence. Her hair infiltrates her dreams. She swears she can smell her perfume on every pair of scrubs she owns. </p><p>And now Agatha won’t stop texting. </p><p>Apparently, confessing the truth about her little arranged engagement unlocked some new level of entitlement and made Agatha feel like she can go right back to being her flirty little self like nothing ever happened. </p><p><em>I can’t sleep. </em>Comes a text around 11am, waking Rio up. </p><p><em>Stop looking at your phone then</em>. Rio replies.</p><p>
<em>Oh, bossy. I like it. </em>
</p><p>
<em>I’m literally your boss. </em>
</p><p>Rio isn’t sure if she should shut this down or just give in and enjoy the fire. Eventually, Agatha will go off and marry Mr. Bohnerific, probably pop out a couple of kids, quit medicine and pretend to enjoy life in the suburbs - her medical degree boxed up in the garage, gathering dust.</p><p>Rio will go back to the job that she lives for. The one that gives her purpose. And slowly, somehow, forget Agatha ever existed. Or at least attempt to. </p><p>Or she could stay mad at her for all the little stunts she’s pulled. Speak to her only when the job deems it necessary. Then no one wins and Rio spends the rest of the year even more miserable.</p><p>Rio tries not to think about the possibilities as she tosses and turns in bed, in the middle of the day, struggling to sleep. </p><p>Maybe they could fuck it out. Once. Get it out of their systems. Like it’s some kind of disease and that might be the cure. Rio won’t lie to herself, the thought crossed her mind as she stood cramped in the tiny space of the supply closet, Agatha inches away. It’s part of the reason she had to leave so fast. Otherwise, the impulse to yank at that damn ponytail until Agatha’s head fell back, her neck exposed, demanding her lips, was going the best of her. Maybe Agatha would back her into the shelving, shove her hand down her scrubs and let her ride her fingers to oblivion. Or Rio could drop to her knees and taste her, Agatha’s hand holding back her hair as her tongue dips into her…</p><p>Fuck, now she’s wet. </p><p>She just needs one quick orgasm. Get off, settle her mind, then she can get some rest. </p><p>She turns to the bedside nightstand, tugging the drawer open to grab her vibrator. Then she drags down her pajama shorts down to her knees and sets the vibrator to a medium setting. But even that, at first contact, feels like too much and she jumps at the sensation.</p><p>She turns it down to low and relaxes, letting her knees fall open, the warmth spreading throughout her belly and core. She focuses on the humming between her legs and exhales against the sensation, the familiar warmth settling in before starting to climb higher. </p><p>But it stops there. The feeling falls, like she’s starting all over again. She rotates her hips against the vibration, trying to grind and deepen the sensation. It doesn’t help. It builds a bit more, then abruptly stops. Her frustration builds. </p><p>“Fuck!” She yells into the void. She turns the vibrator off and pushes it off the edge of the bed. It lands on the floor with a small thud. </p><p>She should just roll over and try to go to sleep but she’s still wet, the unfulfilled sexual desire pulsing beneath her skin. </p><p>She replaces her vibrator with her fingers, trailing down her curls, along her slit. She closes her eyes as she runs her finger across her clit, teasing her entrance. </p><p>The black abyss behind her eyelids falls away until it’s just Agatha in front of her, sitting in her office chair at the hospital, watching her. </p><p>“So wet for me,” She hears Agatha whisper. </p><p>For a second, she wants to shy away, open her eyes and blink away the vision of her intern watching her get off. But she doesn’t move because now, finally, she feels at ease, sliding her fingers from her clit to her entrance. </p><p>She turns to Agatha, to find her staring right at her - face with pure hunger, eyes dilated, watching her finger as it slides easily inside herself. Agatha bites her lip as Rio starts pumping in and out. She can hear how wet she is now, the slick rhythmic sound echoing off her bedroom walls. </p><p>Agatha opens her legs in the chair, dropping her elbows to her knees, leaning closer. It’s like she’s coaching her, encouraging her to keep going - her own private show. As if she can read her mind, she nods to Rio, a small smile across her lips. </p><p>Rio adds a second finger, feeling herself stretch. She whimpers as the spring tightens further, rippling through her as her cunt clenches around her fingers with her movements. </p><p>Her palm presses into her clit and she rotates her hips. She’s so close to dissolving into her pleasure and shattering. She flips onto her stomach quickly, her fingers now curling into her spongy center as she grinds into her hand. </p><p>“Good girl,” Agatha purrs. </p><p>The words send Rio’s back arching, driving her hips into the bed and she sees white behind her eyes.</p><p>Rio comes with a small scream, her mouth dropping open. The wave of her orgasm hits her hard, pulling her under. Her toes curl as every muscle in her body tightens and her walls pulse around her fingers, wet and warm. </p><p>Her body jerks again as the pulsing starts to fade, but doesn’t want to open her eyes yet. She lets the image of Agatha watching her still play in her mind. Like she’s mesmerized by the image of Rio getting off in front of her. Agatha’s fingers dig into the legs of her pants, clinging to the material as if to keep from reaching out and touching her. </p><p>Rio can’t bear the intensity anymore and she snaps her eyes open, the image disappearing instantly. </p><p>A tiny pit forms in her stomach at the thought of visualizing her intern like that. And that she has to face her in only a few hours, pretending like she hadn’t just lost control over the image of her watching. </p><p>The guilt dissipates, slowly gives way to wondering what Agatha would be like in that situation. Would she be commanding? Turn the tables and want to be the one in charge, opposite of their everyday life? </p><p>She falls asleep as the possibilities float through her mind. </p><p>— </p><p>At 2pm, Rio’s phone buzzes again. Agatha is relentless. </p><p>
<em>I heard a rumor. </em>
</p><p>
<em>You should be sleeping. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Can’t. Billy says there was an intern a few years ago, Wanda or something. </em>
</p><p><em>What about her?</em><br/>Rio already knows where this is going. She remembers the Wanda drama. It’s part of the reason the program became so strict on attending-resident relationships in the first place.  </p><p>
<em>That some attending got her pregnant. Then he up and left. Or died? And she went insane. </em>
</p><p><em>Insane is a strong term</em>.</p><p>
<em>So it’s true? </em>
</p><p><em>Try to sleep, Agatha. See you tonight</em>.<br/>Rio’s final text reads, before she sets her phone face down. </p><p>Her phone buzzes once more as she starts drifting to sleep. She glances at it with half opened eyes. </p><p>
<em>If you left, I might go insane too. </em>
</p><p>—</p><p>Night shift always goes one of two ways.</p><p>Either its 12 hours of nonstop chaos - stat pages, crashing patients and too many cups of coffee with the night blurring into the light of early morning.  These kinds of nights love to happen on full moons. </p><p>Or it’s unusually quiet. The hospital, like the rest of the world, actually sleeps and the hospital hallways have a stillness to them, a peace. And those nights, she is only paged to a patient room in the case of an emergency.</p><p>Rio can usually tell what kind of night it’s going to be the second she walks into the hospital at 7pm. Either the electric buzz of frenzied energy or an unnatural calm fills the air. It’s like the hospital is a living breathing entity - the walls pulsing with life and death. </p><p>Tonight it’s the latter. And for once, she is grateful for it. The madness of the last few weeks, lends way to a quiet mercy. A chance to breathe. </p><p>She grabs a few snacks and an iced coffee from the cafeteria as soon as she walks in before settling into the attending call room. She kicks off her shoes and curls up on the twin sized bed with a new book. </p><p>Her pager and cell phone sit diligently on the bedside table, awaiting a call. </p><p>She tries not to think of Agatha in the resident call room. The potential that she’s just a hallway away.</p><p>Rio stares back at her book. She’s read the same paragraph three times and absorbed none of it. The words dissolve against the background noise of her thoughts - of Agatha. </p><p>If Rio opens the door, turns left and walks down the hallway 50 feet, she might find Agatha stretched across a small bed. Maybe her hair would be sprawled across the pillow while she scrolls through her phone or maybe she’s already asleep - curled on her side in her too tight scrubs.</p><p>She hates that she’s wondering what Agatha is doing. Or wondering about her at all. Everytime Agatha infiltrates her thoughts, a little voice in the back of her mind reminds her she’s engaged. Off limits. Her intern. </p><p>Now that she’s in the hospital, the fun idea of flirting and touching seems much more risque. There is no situation in the world where this doesn’t end in her world imploding. </p><p>A sudden buzz interrupts her thoughts and she jumps at the noise before realizing it’s her pager. She drops the book in her lap and scrambles to stop the intrusive noise. </p><p>It’s the emergency room calling her to admit a patient to the hospital - an elderly lady with a broken hip. It’s a fairly easy case and a pleasant patient - so she gives it to Billy to undertake. Her rule of thumb is to always give an easy admission to the weakest intern; that way she has a strong intern saved for any true catastrophes. </p><p>An hour later, she sits beside Billy in the emergency room, staring at the computers at the nurses station. He drones on slowly during his assessment of the patient with Rio filling in any gaps he missed. </p><p>As he finishes, he spins in his office chair to turn toward her. “So,” he pauses, more casual now with a sly smile on his face, “how long have you been working here?” </p><p>“Almost 10 years,” she says nonchalantly, eyes on the computer in front of her as she looks through the patient’s x-rays. </p><p>“But what brought you to this hospital? Did you grow up around here or something?” </p><p>Suddenly, this feels more like prying than casual conversation. She turns her chair to face him, eyes narrow. “What’s with the small talk?” </p><p>He blinks. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“You always try to dig into your attendings’ personal history or am I just the lucky winner tonight?”</p><p>“I’m just trying to get to know you,” he gives a small shrug like it’s no big deal. </p><p>“Or fishing. Looking for dirt to report back to Agatha?” </p><p>Billy’s eyes grow wide at her question and Rio realizes what she said a second too late. </p><p>“Now, why would I be reporting anything back to another intern?” He eggs her on, knowing she’s been caught. </p><p>“Isn’t she your friend?” Rio attempts to pivot. Nothing has happened between you two, she has to mentally remind herself. Any tea Billy thinks he has on her, any leverage he could try to use for God-knows-what, means nothing.</p><p>“And she’s your intern. Not really how the hierarchy works, right?”</p><p>Rio doesn’t answer right away, which apparently Billy thinks of a gateway to pry some more into her life. </p><p>“Is that why you are jealous of her engagement?” He leans forward toward her like he’s sharing a secret. “Did something like <em>happen</em>-happen with you two?” He’s far too giddy about the entire conversation.</p><p>“You’re officially the most annoying intern I’ve ever had.”</p><p>“You didn’t deny it.” </p><p>“I don’t owe anything. I’m your boss, remember?,” Rio snaps. “And if you were even half as good at medicine as you are at gossip, I might trust you with more than a broken hip.”</p><p>“Ok, ok,” He throws his hands up in mock defense. “I’ll go.” He stands and gathers his things, his lips pursed like he’s contemplating saying more. </p><p>“Let the others know I’ll call them if there is another admission,” Rio says flatly before turning back to the computer. </p><p>Billy stops a few feet away, turning again to Rio like he just can’t resist. He looks around quickly to make sure there is no one else within earshot. </p><p>“For what it’s worth, she literally never stops talking about you. Even if half of it is about how annoying you can be.”</p><p>Rio tries not top smile as he turns to leave. </p><p>—</p><p>A couple of hours later, she’s actually bored. At least busy nights make the shift go faster; a little adrenaline of a crashing patient every few hours keeps her energized.</p><p>Tonight is just crawling by. She did a quick yoga video she found on youtube, downed another cup of coffee and caught up on a bunch of bills that needed to be paid. </p><p>She even did two laps around the emergency room nurses’ station, practically looking for work to do. </p><p>Now she’s lounging in the office chair in the call room, feet propped up on the desk as she scrolls Tik Tok. </p><p>She’s watching yet another Hacks edit when the call room door squeaks open, a mess of black hair poking through the crack.</p><p>Billy sticks his head through, then quickly drops his eyes, realizing a second too late that he probably should have knocked. </p><p>“What’s going on?” Rio asks, her feet dropping off the desk as she is immediately concerned about his sudden presence.</p><p>“Just seeing if you want to join us for a movie?” Billy looks up cheerfully, opening the door more widely. </p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Well it’s been…I won’t say it.” Billy’s eyes dart around, remembering he can’t say the “q word” in the hospital. “But we have some down time. We were going to put a movie on my laptop in the call room.” </p><p>Rio instantly wants to say no. Historically, attendings don’t hang around the interns during night shifts.</p><p>Intern usually spend their time chugging energy drinks in their call room, spilling late night secrets to each other. Attendings…well they sleep, stretch, walk laps around the hospital hallways. They aren’t 25 anymore and night shift tends to wreck more havoc on their bodies. </p><p>There is one thing pushing Rio to say yes to a movie on a tiny laptop screen in a cramped call room.</p><p>Well, one person.</p><p>So she agrees. </p><p>When Rio steps into the room, the whole setup feels suspiciously intentional. Billy and Alice sit on the floor in front of the twin size bed, a laptop propped on an office chair in front of them. </p><p>Agatha is already propped up on the bed behind them, squished to one side, leaving an open area to her left. A well-worn hospital blanket that she clearly stole from the nurses’ station rests across her lap. </p><p>Rio kicks off her shoes and climbs to sit cross legged on the bed next to her, her knee just barely brushing along the side of Agatha’s thigh. Agatha doesn’t make a move to scoot away. </p><p>“They picked the movie,” Agatha notes as Billy starts up the screen. “It’s some low budget horror film about sharks in tornadoes.” </p><p>“Hey!” Alice sounds slightly offended as she clicks off the room lights. </p><p>“Sharknado could totally happen,” Billy insists. </p><p>Rio feels like she’s back in high school again, watching movies in her basement with stolen beer, her heart thudding as her fingers creep closer to the girl beside her, hoping she wouldn’t pull away. </p><p>As the movie begins, Alice and Billy open a bag of Doritos and M&amp;M’s that they snatched from the doctor’s lounge. </p><p>The movie is as bad as promised, full of cheap CGI and cheesy dialogue. Twenty minutes in, now nearly 2am, Rio is struggling to stay awake. She shifts to lean back against the wall, letting her head tip back until she’s resting in a comfortable position. </p><p>Then she feels it. </p><p>A hand slights over her right thigh, slow and deliberate, felt through the fabric of her scrubs.</p><p>Her eyes snap open.</p><p>Agatha is still looking straight ahead, seemingly focused on the screen. She has a small subtle smile curved into her lips. </p><p>Rio’s gaze drops to her leg. At some point, the edge of the blanket has shifted so it’s now draped across both their laps, neatly hiding Agatha’s hand. </p><p>Agatha’s thumb begins to trace slow, deliberate circles over her fabric. </p><p>Rio should move. Or pull away. But she really, really doesn’t want to. Not when Agatha’s fingers drift toward her inner thigh, gripping the soft flesh there with quiet, possessive pressure. It’s a fucking bold move for Agatha to assume Rio wouldn’t just jump up, calling her out in front of her peers. But as her fingers keep moving, Rio realizes she doesn’t just want to see how far Agatha will push this - she wants her to touch her. </p><p>A rush of warmth floods between her legs as Rio realizes just how close Agatha’s fingers are now to her center, the tips of her fingers skimming the outline of her briefs. Then the faint scent hits her - sharp, musky and hers, lingering in the too small room with the faint smell of sex. </p><p>She knows Agatha can smell it too. Her nostrils flare, her eyelids flicker wider. Her fingernails digging into Rio’s clothed thigh. </p><p>She hopes the others can’t smell it too. </p><p>This is a whole new level of inappropriateness and Agatha isn’t even touching her skin. Despite the fact that her two other interns are sitting right in front of her, and they’re on duty in the hospital call room, Rio wants Agatha’s fingers to do more than sit on top of her clothes. </p><p>Rio barely turns her head, just enough to catch Agatha’s profile. Her lashes are lowered, jaw tense. Rio can see her breathing a bit heavier, like she’s holding back something, hungry. </p><p>Rio’s hand slides slowly under the blanket, careful not to make too much noise. Before she can think further about it, she places her hand flat on top of Agatha’s. For a second, it feels affectionate, like teenagers awkwardly holding hands, but moments later, she’s moving, dragging Agatha’s hand upward to the waistband of her scrubs. </p><p>Then she lets go, leaving Agatha’s hand hovering at her waistband. A thought flashes in her mind quickly that she doesn’t want to push her, this has to be Agatha’s decision, not hers. </p><p>The air seems to shift then, Agatha’s back straightening as the tension increases. Her fingers shift under the blanket, tugging at her pants. Rio’s pulse starts to thunder in her eyes. Her breath catches at the movement. </p><p>The drawstring of Rio’s scrubs loosens in a single pull, the knot falling away. Rio exhales as her thighs relax, opening to her, inviting. </p><p>No one in the room seems to notice. The movie drones on, a faint laugh of Alice heard in the distance. Everyone else feels so far away, like it’s only the two of them there. </p><p>Rio’s stomach muscles tense as Agatha’s fingers brush along her skin, slipping beneath the loosened band of pants. A lightest touch across her skin ignites her like a flame. The room feels too hot and she wants to throw the blanket off her lap and yank down her scrubs. </p><p>But she can’t. </p><p>Not here.</p><p>She can only focus on the way Agatha’s fingers drag down the front of her briefs. The way she starts to throb for her, growing wetter. </p><p>Agatha keeps her fingers on top of Rio’s underwear, continuing their journey south before settling between her thighs. The fabric there is drenched and Rio can see her bite her lip as she registers it. Her palm presses down over the soaked cotton. She grinds in slow circles, the heel of her hand adding pressure where Rio aches for it. </p><p>Rio’s head drops back against the wall, careful not to let it thud. Her breath catches and she fights the urge to buck up into the pressure. But her patience is fraying, her thighs starting to tremble as she’s barely holding on. </p><p>It’s like tunnel vision now. The desire for Agatha to sink her fingers into her, push her over the edge has taken over any rational part of her brain. </p><p>But it’s Agatha who stops. Her fingers still over the material, but she doesn’t pull completely away. </p><p>At the loss of movement, a soft, broken whimper slips from Rio’s lips before she can catch it. She opens her half-lidded eyes to see Agatha leaning in, close enough that her breath puffs along the shell of her ear. </p><p>“Can you be quiet for me?” She whispers, voice rough and thick. </p><p>Rio swallows hard before nodding subtly. </p><p>Agatha smiles wickedly. “Good girl.” </p><p>And that’s all it takes for her to push the material to the side, slipping into her wet folds. </p><p>Rio opens her mouth in a silent gasp, her eyes screwing shut as Agatha drags two fingers through her arousal. Her fingers glide through her cunt, gathering her wetness up to circle her clit. She continues like this, raking up and down, never dipping more than the slight tip of her fingertip inside her.  </p><p>Rio’s fingers find purchase on the only thing in front of her, the old hospital blanket across her lap. She twists it in her palm in an attempt to keep from screaming. Her hips buck up once into Agatha’s fingers, desperate for more. The pleasure is spreading across her belly, fire raging across her skin with each brush of her clit. It’s not enough, she wants Agatha to fill her. Ruin her. Thoughts of her naked, tangled in her sheets, her head between her thighs, threatened to overwhelm her. </p><p>It’s everything and not enough as she circles her clit again, Rio’s cheeks flaring red as she feels another gush of her arousal coat Agatha’s palm. </p><p>“You’re soaked,” Agatha mutters, voice barely audible but thick with heat. “You want this that badly?”</p><p>Rio bites her lips as she nods, unable to look Agatha in the eyes and admit what she does to her. </p><p>“Use your words.” </p><p>“Yes,” Rio breathes. “God, yes.” </p><p>Rio didn’t expect this shift in dynamic. The younger woman, her trainee, had her practically begging for her touch. </p><p>Agatha hums low in her throat, her smirk returning as she shifts in the bed. Her hand never leaves Rio’s skin as she angles herself so the tip of her fingers find her entrance. She doesn’t hesitate as she slides a finger inside her. Then another. The stretch steals the air from Rio’s lungs, but she doesn’t dare cry out. Not here. </p><p>“Stay quiet,” Agatha murmurs again. This time she presses a featherlight kiss to Rio’s cheek. “Or I stop.”</p><p>Rio purses her lips, not a sound coming out. She might just up and quit her job before she lets Agatha stop touching her at this moment. Agatha moves again, slow, deep thrusts of her fingers before curling inside of her. </p><p>Rio tries to stay silent, but her body betrays her. Her hips roll to meet every thrust, every nerve electrified. She’s thankful for the obnoxiously loud scenes of people screaming in the movie playing somewhere in the room as her breath comes in small, deperate gasps while Agatha fucks her. </p><p>Agatha watches her falling apart, her eyes dark as she takes in Rio’s flushed cheeks, her tense jaw, her quick breaths. She presses her forehead briefly into Rio’s temple, not stopping. </p><p>“You’re doing so good,” she murmurs, like she’s the one coaching Rio. “You’re so fucking good for me.” </p><p>The praise slices through Rio with more force than the touch. And Rio doesn’t care anymore. She wants to hear her low voice waning on control, coaxing her orgasm out of her. </p><p>Her thighs begin to tremble, the pressure coiling fast and hard in her belly. Agatha must feel the way she clenches around her fingers because he presses deeper, burying her knuckles into her. </p><p>Rio is frantic now, her teeth buried in her bottom lip to stifle the sounds that threaten to tear out of her. </p><p>She’s on the edge of her orgasm, as Agatha curls her fingers into her once more, her thumb pressing into her clit. </p><p>For a brief second, she steals a glance at Agatha only to find her watching her, her expression softer. Their eyes meet for a brief second, but it’s Agatha who looks away first, her eyes dropping down to the blanket, like the intensity of Rio’s gaze is physically burning her. </p><p>It’s the vulnerability in that moment that undoes her. </p><p>The orgasm hits like a wave, sudden and violent. Her legs jerk, threatening to kick the blanket off. A strangled sound from her throat starts to escape. Agatha’s other hand flies up to cover her mouth as it does, making the angle now awkward and twisted. Rio folds forward instinctively to the only thing in front of her, forcing her to bury her face into the crook of Agatha’s neck as she convulses. </p><p>Agatha holds her there, her hand moving slowly as she coaxes her through the aftershocks.  As Rio stills, she remains pressed against Agatha’s neck and side, heart racing as she comes down from her high. </p><p>Agatha draws her fingers out of her scrubs slowly when she finally stills. She catches a glimpse of Rio’s eyes once more before she brings them both to her mouth and sucking them clean. Her tongue laps along the sides. </p><p>She turns to Rio, mouthing “so good” before she continues her quest to clean every last drop from her skin. </p><p>“Agatha?” comes Billy’s voice, suddenly, from the floor below. </p><p>Rio jumps at the sound, reality crashing back into place. She’s still in the call room. The resident call room. The interns sit immediately below the space she was just fucked in. The air feels colder, the room feels much smaller, and the movie too loud. </p><p>Agatha is unfazed. </p><p>“Hmm...” She mumbles with her two fingers still in her mouth. </p><p>“How did you like it?” He asks. She gives him a blank look, the fingers dropping from her mouth onto the blanket below, wiping off the saliva. He gestures to the laptop. “The movie.” </p><p>“It was better than I ever imagined,” Agatha sugar coats. “I’d just love to watch it again sometime.” </p><p>Rio knows she isn’t talking about a low-budget shark movie anymore. She feels her neck flush at the innuendo, guilt following right behind it. </p><p>She just let an intern fuck her. Publicly in a call room. Never in her 10 years at this hospital has she done anything so remotely close to this. Hell, she hasn’t even called in sick before. </p><p>A wave of nausea rolls through her. </p><p>“What did you think, Rio?” Agatha asks, all innocence. Then she slowly, deliberately, adds “I mean <em>Dr. Vidal</em>.” </p><p>Rio stands up quickly, the blood rushing a bit from her head as she does. She gathers her pager and cell phone, shoving them into her scrub pants, still untied. She starts rushing to the door, almost tripping over Billy’s outstretched legs in the process. </p><p>“I’ll page you if something comes up,” she mutters, pulling the door shut behind her. Just outside, she stops to slump against the wall, face buried in her hands. </p><p>Through the door, she can hear Billy’s voice drift out, “I guess she didn’t like it.” </p><p>“Oh no,” Agatha laughs. “She loved it.” </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p><br/>Rio’s sneakers hit the linoleum hard as she moves down the hallway, trying to refrain from breaking into a full-on run. Every movement is a reminder of what she just did - her scrubs rubbing against her damp, sticky thighs, her skin too sensitive from Agatha’s touch. </p><p>She ducks back into her call room. The overhead fluorescent light feels too harsh, too bright on her overtired eyes. She clicks off the light switch with shaky hands, turning on the small desk lamp on the nightstand instead. It basks the room in a softer, warm glow. </p><p>It wasn’t supposed to happen. Not here. And not like that - with Agatha in control, with Rio giving in so easily, so fast.</p><p>She drops onto the bed as she exhales slowly, but it catches in her throat halfway. She covers her face with both hands, just trying to regain some sense of composure. </p><p>What the fuck are you doing?</p><p>It’s not like her. She’s the attending. She’s supposed to be above this. Detached. In control.</p><p>Not letting some barely-graduated intern finger her in a call room at work.</p><p>Is it worse that she let her? Or worse that she enjoyed it so much she’s already thinking about what it would feel like for Agatha to get her off again? </p><p>Fuck.</p><p>There’s a knock at the door and she freezes. She wants to pretend she doesn’t know who it is. Or that she isn’t there. Neither of which she can actually get away with. </p><p>“Dr. Vidal?”</p><p>Rio closes her eyes. She doesn’t answer.</p><p>The door cracks open anyway. Of course it does, because Agatha never waits for permission. </p><p>Agatha slips inside wordlessly and closes the door behind her, leaning against it casually. She seems so untouchable, despite her somewhat disheveled look. Her scrub top is wrinkled and untucked. Her hair now pulled out of her usually messy ponytail and tangled down her back. Her cheeks are flushed pink and Rio tries not to think about how she could be the reason behind it. </p><p>“Are you hiding,” Agatha says, voice low, “or panicking?”</p><p>“Get out.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t move.</p><p>Rio rises from her spot on the bed, walking forward until she’s face to face with her. “I said get out, Agatha,” she practically growls, clenching her jaw. </p><p>That makes Agatha blink, but just once, before she tilts her head instead of retreating. Her voice drops low. “Say my name like that again.” </p><p>Rio’s face flushes hot. “Don’t.”</p><p>“You liked it,” Agatha murmurs. She leans in, peeling herself away from the door until her mouth hovers only centimeters from Rio’s lips. She can feel small puffs of air hit her face as Agatha whispers, “I felt you. Every part of you wanted that.” </p><p>She backs up against the door once more, her eyes raking down Rio, taking her all in, “You still do. Don’t you?”</p><p>Rio plants a hand on the door behind Agatha’s head, an attempt to steady herself. Her fingers linger just above Agatha’s hair, pressing firmly into the wood. It ends up looking more like she’s caging her in - and maybe she is. She wants to take the power back, set the world back on its rightful axis. Despite being taller, despite being her boss, she still feels like she is the one unraveling. Even now, the proximity of Agatha makes her dizzy, like her mind is fuzzy, tunnel vision except for the one person in front of her. </p><p>“You don’t get to talk to me like that,” Rio murmurs, but there is no real bite to it. Her eyes drop to Agatha’s lips as she says it and the words feel hollow, false. </p><p>“I do, actually. You let me.”</p><p>“That was a mistake,” Rio resolves quickly. </p><p>A slow, wicked smile curls across Agatha’s face. She steps forward, close enough for Rio to feel the heat rolling off her skin. </p><p>“Are. You. Sure?” She pauses with every word. Deliberate. Calculated. As she does, she brings her palm to the junction of Rio’s thighs, pressing her fingers into the damp material. </p><p>“Are you wet for me right now, doctor?” She murmurs, “If I reach into your scrubs again, will I find you dripping for me?” </p><p>The dam breaks. </p><p>Rio drops her hand from the door frame, threading into the nape of Agatha’s neck, bracing her there. Her fingers dig into the flesh, just enough and Agatha tilts her head back on instinct. Rio’s other hand slams into her right hip, nails digging in, holding her there possessively. </p><p>In an instant, Rio’s lips crash into Agatha’s. The hesitation, the guilt is gone, replaced with heat and hunger overtaking her. </p><p>Rio tilts her head to kiss her deeper, feeling more frantic now. She bruises into her, her left hand pulling at her hair, opening Agatha up to her mouth more. She feels possessed. Or possessive - no man, no random fiancé in the world would kiss her like this. Like she’s trying to consume her, brand her. Until Rio’s face is the only thing in Agatha’s mind every time she sees that stupid man she’s engaged to. </p><p>Her body starts to ache for Agatha once more. The cooling, damp underwear growing warm, fresh with new arousal. She wants her deeper, more wholly. There is no coming back from this. No place that exists where Rio will ever not think of Agatha’s hip gliding against hers, the fire pooling in her belly. </p><p>When Rio’s tongue slips past her lips, Agatha’s composure slips. </p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha growls, her hands flying to cradle Rio’s jaw. Her fingers dig in as she kisses her back with matching intensity, her tongue moving in tune with Rio’s. </p><p>Agatha’s hands trail down her neck, her shoulders, starting to roam down her body. Rio can feel the control slipping again, the desire to just bend to Agatha’s will starting to pull her under. </p><p>But not this time. This time she wants to feel her. </p><p>She gathers Agatha’s hair in her hand, close to the root, and tugs. Agatha’s eyes snap up to meet Rio’s - the motion clearly work - dark, deep desire clouds her vision. </p><p>Rio wraps an arm around her waist, raising her from the door she’s pressed against. Agatha practically yelps, caught off guard at the ease in which Rio carries her with one arm. </p><p>“Bed, now.” Rio commands. </p><p>She drops Agatha in front of the bed, onto her feet. Agatha breaks the kiss, for just a second, whipping off her shirt in the process, Her bra quickly follows.</p><p>And Rio can’t help it, she looks down at her - bare chested, nipples pebbled under the cool air of the room. </p><p>She takes two large steps toward her. Agatha must think she’s going to touch her, the way her back straightens like she’s offering her chest up as some sacrifice, a prize. </p><p>Instead, Rio hooks both arms behind Agatha’s thighs and hoists her up. Agatha’s legs wrap around her waist instinctively. </p><p>“God, you’re strong,” Agatha’s hand run down Rio’s shoulders, squeezing her biceps. </p><p>“I have a small gym in my garage where I lift. Plus yoga. Sometimes I find the videos on YouTube. Like tonight, I….”</p><p>She’s cut off by Agatha’s lips leaning down from her spot above her. She deeps the kiss, fingers gripping Agatha’s thighs as she does - until Agatha pulls back just enough to speak. </p><p>“You’re adorable. But are you going to keep talking about your exercise routine or are you going to fuck me?” </p><p>Rio walks over to the edge of the bed, her legs bumping against the wood bed frame. She drops Agatha onto her back, landing with a soft thud on the small mattress.</p><p>Agatha plants both feet on the bed and lifts her hips, sliding off her scrub pants and underwear in one smooth motion before tossing them to the floor. </p><p>Rio should have known Agatha would be like this. Unabashed, looking like a sinful present as she scoots forward on the bed. Rio can’t help but watch as she brings her knees up, feet braced at the bed’s edge. </p><p>Open.</p><p>She’s opened herself up to her as fully as she can. Rio wants to think of it like an offering. </p><p>Agatha pushes up onto her elbows, her abs flexing slightly as she watches Rio. Studies her. </p><p>Rio takes a second to drink her all in. She drags her gaze over Agatha’s body - her breath catches at the sight of her - laid out, legs spread and waiting. Her thighs are flushed and trembling just slightly. The soft swell of her stomach rises with every breath. A small landing strip of curls stops right before her folds, the hair glistening with slick arousal. She’s puffy and pink with want. </p><p>Rio drops to her knees in front of the bed, like she’s at an altar and Agatha’s cunt is all she wants to worship. </p><p>Agatha sucks in a breath as her hands curl into the sheets behind her. Waiting. Anticipating. </p><p>Rio slides her hands up the back of Agatha’s thighs, fingers sinking into the skin as she leans forward. She drags her mouth along the inside of one thigh, unhurried, until she moves toward the junction of her legs. </p><p>Her right hand spreads Agatha open, fingers slowly coating themselves in her arousal. </p><p>“You’re soaked,” Rio whispers against her thigh, her voice low. “You’re unbelievable.” </p><p>“Shut up,” Agatha returns as her hand pushes Rio’s head down toward her cunt, making her desire known. </p><p>Rio drops her head closer, becoming enveloped in her scent. She flicks her tongue against her once, light and maddening. Agatha jerks her hips lifting to get closer. </p><p>Then Rio flattens her tongue to take one long, slow lick along the folds. </p><p>“Shit,” she takes another long swipe of Agatha’s folds. “You even taste good.”</p><p>“Of course I do,” Agatha moans. </p><p>Rio brings her mouth back to her, lapping at her. </p><p>As she dips her tongue into her entrance, Agatha’s hips begin to roll in smooth circles, a ring of wetness forming beneath her on the sheets. Rio continues to lap at her, circling her clit then tracing down. </p><p>The rhythm starts to shift as Agatha grows more frantic. She grinds against Rio’s mouth with purpose now. Her fingers tangle in Rio’s hair, tugging hard, holding her there. Forcing her deeper. </p><p>She’s drowning in her, surrounded by the scent of her arousal, the slick desire on her tongue and the desperate, broken moans pouring from Agatha’s lips. </p><p>It’s heaven wrapped in an HR nightmare. But nothing else matters at this moment. She just wants to feel Agatha come against her mouth. </p><p>She picks up the pace, sucking hard against Agatha’s clit. Agatha lets out a strangled cry, her hips moving in more frantic, uneven thrusts. Rio reaches out, an arm pinning her hips to the bed, holding her tight against her mouth.</p><p>She can feel Agatha’s arm against her head, fingers now grasping at her own breast, pinching and rolling the nipple beneath her fingertips. </p><p>A wrecked moan comes from above her, Agatha’s head falling backward. </p><p>“Do you want more?” Rio asks, her voice low and hoarse. She doesn’t want to wait for an answer before diving back in, lapping at her then alternating sucking and flicking her clit. She brings a hand up to the inside of her thigh, fingers poised along the flesh at her entrance. </p><p>Rio wants to touch her. Fill her. She wants Agatha to sit on her face until she can’t breathe. Until her lungs burn and her mouth is soaked with nothing but her. </p><p>She can tell Agatha is holding back. Rio can feel it in the trembling of her high, her swollen cunt starts to clench, so close but not quite falling over the edge. </p><p>“Let go, Agatha,” she sucks more fervently on her clit, before pressing her tongue flat against the bud, applying pressure. </p><p>“Fingers,” Agatha moans, the words coming out rushed. “Now.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t wait. She pushes two fingers inside her, sliding through her with ease. She curls them upward instantly, hitting the spongy spot as she pumps in once, twice - the wet, squishy sound is obscene. And perfect. </p><p>At the same time her tongue circles her clit again with tight, focused swirls around the swollen bud, in sync with her fingers.</p><p>Agatha screams. </p><p>Her thighs clamp shut around Rio’s head and hand trapping her there in the shudder of her climax. The sound is muffled by Agatha’s thighs and Rio can only pray no one else hears it. </p><p>A gush of wetness escapes Agatha, squirting forward to flood Rio’s mouth until it’s dripping down her chin and onto the bed beneath Agatha’s thighs. She sucks it down greedily, like a woman starved. </p><p>Her mouth stays there, lingering with slow, steady licks as Agatha jerks above her. </p><p>Goosebumps rise along Agatha’s thighs as she comes down from her high. “I…” she sighs, her head and arms dropping back onto the bed as she lies back. “I’ve never done that before.” </p><p>“I want to do that again,” Rio murmurs, drunk on the idea of more Agatha. Her fingers find Agatha’s entrance once more, pressing in up to the first knuckle. </p><p>Agatha hisses at the sensation, her stomach muscles tightening in response. </p><p>Rio pauses, stilling her fingers. She hesitates before she starts to pull back. </p><p>“Come back,” Agatha insists, her hand moving to grasp Rio’s wrist, guiding her firmly back in place. </p><p>Rio eases two fingers inside again, pushing in slowing, giving Agatha the chance to adjust to the sensitivity. She holds them there, waiting, placing small kisses along Agatha’s inner thighs. She can taste her salty sweet arousal starting to dry on the skin. </p><p>“God, please move,” Agatha groans frustratedly, pushing her hips up against Rio’s still hand. Her voice is tight, just edged on desperation. Rio loves it. </p><p>She stays perfectly still, fingers buried deep but unmoving, her mouth still resting near the inside of Agatha’s thigh. She’s pushing her further, edging her toward desperation. </p><p>Agatha keeps moving her hips, seeking friction despite Rio’s lack of movement. Agatha might be panting, flushed, legs spread wide - but she’s still trying to keep a shred of control, that much is obvious. Agatha moves her hand down her abdomen to swipe across her clit, taking matters into her own hands. </p><p>“Uh uh.” Rio’s hand grasps at Agatha wrist, drawing it to Agatha’s side, pinning it there. </p><p>“Then do something already!” </p><p>Rio presses a small kiss along her mons, then drags her tongue along the sides of her folds - not touching where Agatha wants her month. Teasing. Tormenting.   </p><p>Agatha gasps, thighs trembling. “Rio, please.” </p><p>Rio smiles, lips curling against the inside of her thigh. “Say it again.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice drops to a sultry purr. “Dr. Vidal.” </p><p>That does it. </p><p>Rio grins before her tongue dives into her soaked folds, quickly making her way to lock her hips around her clit and sucking - hard. At the same time, her fingers curl and thrust deep, buried inside her. </p><p>“More,” Agatha cries out, her voice breaking. </p><p>Rio sinks a third finger into Agatha, feeling her stretch and then clench around her. She is hot and pulsing around her fingers. </p><p>“Fuck,” Rio groans as Agatha flutters around her. “So tight.” </p><p>She draws her fingers out, then pushes back in with a steady glide. She picks up the pace, her fingers working in an unrelenting rhythm. Her palm grinds against Agatha’s clit.</p><p>Agatha lets out a strangled sound, somewhere between a gasp and a moan. </p><p>“Shit,” Agatha exhales sharply, her voice wrecked. “I’m going to come.”</p><p>The second orgasm crashes into her more quickly. Her body locks up, eyes squeezing shut as wave after wave rolls through her. She’s left shaking and gasping, her hips stuttering against Rio’s hand. </p><p>Rio doesn’t stop. She keeps sucking, fingers moving deep to drag every last spasm from her body, determined to make her feel everything. </p><p>Only when Agatha jerk away, her body too raw and oversensitive, does Rio finally relent. </p><p>She carefully withdraws her fingers, gently as Agatha twitches slightly at the loss.</p><p>Rio reaches toward the bedside table, grabbing a few tissues. “Sorry,” she looks up at Agatha apologetically, holding the tissue in her hand, “I wish I had something better.” </p><p>Rio leans in, gently dabbing up with what can without adding to the stimulation. She moves quietly before wiping off her own fingers. Agatha’s legs drop off the edge of the bed - heavy and exhausted. She lets out a low sigh, her body loose and boneless, before crawling up toward the pillow. </p><p>Rio rises slowly from the floor, her knees stiff from kneeling too long. She stretches, shaking out her legs gently before climbing onto the bed, sitting next to Agatha. Agatha is already there, reclining with her head on the pillow. Too comfortable, too at home in the attending call room space. </p><p>Rio hovers for a moment, undecided, ultimately resolving that she feels more content sitting up next to her. She brings her knees up, resting her arms across them. </p><p>But Agatha won’t allow the distance. She reaches out, fingers curling gently around Rio’s hand, tugging her down beside her. </p><p>Rio concedes easily to drop to the pillow next to her. Her eyes fix on the ceiling, listening to the sounds of Agatha’s breathing even out.</p><p>It takes her half a minute before Agatha turns to her to rest on her side, one arm tucked behind her head. </p><p>“You’re still dressed,” Agatha notes, voice casual but pointed. </p><p>Rio glances down at her scrubs, then back at her. “That I am,” she says with a tight-lipped smile. </p><p>Agatha reaches over, fingers grasping the hem of Rio’s top, starting to ease it upward. </p><p>But Rio catches her wrist mid-motion, stopping her. “Don’t,” she shifts sideways on the bed, creating more space between them. </p><p>Agatha raises an eyebrow. “Why? Nervous?” Her tone is teasing, edged with mischief. “You’ve already come for me once, you know. That was…incredibly hot, by the way.” </p><p>“This isn’t the same.”</p><p>“How so?” Agatha props herself up on her elbow. </p><p>Rio hesitates. “You’re 25. Look at you.” Her eyes rake down her still naked body, lounging casually in front of her. </p><p>Agatha tilts her head at Rio, waiting for more explanation. </p><p>“God, this is embarrassing.” Rio drops her gaze. Looking into Agatha’s icy blue eyes is just too much. Too intense. Too vulnerable. “I’m twenty years older than you, Agatha. My body is twenty years old. Softer. Different.”</p><p>“Different doesn’t mean worse you know.”</p><p>Rio lets out a low, humorless laugh. “Spoke like someone whose skin still bounces back.”</p><p>“I’ll close my eyes,” Agatha teases, squeezing them shut then slips her fingers under the hem of Rio’s shirt, tugging it just beneath her breasts. </p><p>Agatha cracks one eye open, stealing a playful peek at the exposed skin then grinning as she pushes the shirt higher, over Rio’s breasts and off entirely. She moves down her body again, tugging at the scrub pants, still untied from earlier. </p><p>“I know you are peeking.” </p><p>“So sue me.” As Agatha says it, she reaches behind Rio’s back to snap open her bra, stripping it off. </p><p>Rio shivers as Agatha’s fingers begin to trace along the curve of her ribs. </p><p>“Agatha…” It’s meant to be a warning, but it lands somewhere between a sigh and a plea.</p><p>“God you are so hot.” Agatha murmurs, fingers still tracing the underside of Rio’s breast. </p><p>Rio rolls her eyes sarcastically, a smile tugging at the corner of her mouth. “Be serious.”</p><p>“I am.” Agatha places feather light kisses along her collarbones, working her way down to her sternum.  “Have you seen you?” </p><p>Rio sucks in a breath, her body arching without permission. The motion forces her breasts closer to Agatha’s mouth. Agatha hovers there, her long brown hair cascading down her face, across Rio’s chest. Her tongue flicks out, teasing the tip of her nipple. Then she closes her lips, blowing cool air across the damp peak. </p><p>Rio shudders. </p><p>The motion pulls a smile from Agatha, like a challenge has just been unlocked. She cups Rio’s breast fully, settling the weight of it in her hand, squeezing slightly. Her thumb pinches the nipple, rolling and pinching the sensitive nub. </p><p>Then Agatha leans in again, sealing her mouth over Rio’s nipple. She sucks softly, just enough to make her whimper. </p><p>“Oh shit,” Rio breathes, her head tipping forward to watch Agatha - her mouth works on one breast, while her hand tugs at the other. Rio hands slide into Agatha’s hair, anchoring her there as her hips shift, seeking friction. </p><p>Agatha deepens the motion, sucking hard at her, sending lightning down Rio’s abdomen straight to her core. A sharp cry escapes Rio’s lips as Agatha continues her relentless pace.</p><p>Rio can’t believe how fast it’s building, how quickly she’s unraveling and she realizes she might come from this. She doesn’t care if it’s too much, too soon, she wants to shatter. And now. </p><p>“Don’t…don’t stop,” Rio whimpers, her voice breathy. Agatha quickens her pace, tongue lapping hungrily, her teeth grazing the hypersensitive skin just enough to sting. </p><p>Rio’s chest starts to heave, her breathing growing heavier. A slight sheen of sweat coats her forehead as the room grows warmer. Her whole body coils, teetering on the edge. </p><p>Then Agatha pulls back. </p><p>“Wait, no, no, no,” Rio protests, her voice bordering on panicked. “Why did you stop?”</p><p>Agatha climbs up to meet her gaze,  lips wet with saliva. “I’m not letting you come just from that,” she smirks like she figured her out. “I’m not done with you yet.” </p><p>“Oh that’s so not fair,” Rio argues, but Agatha doesn’t move. She just watches like she’s letting Rio cool down. Rio is having none of it. Her nipples still feel the buzz of Agatha’s tongue, her clit throbbing with want and inattention. “Fine, I’ll take care of it myself then.” She trails her hand down her curls, seeking her wet heat. Her fingers graze her clit, her legs squeeze together as she increases the pressure. </p><p>For a second, Agatha watches her, eyes wide at the image of Rio’s fingers sinking into herself. It’s like she’s mesmerized by the image before her, watching reverently. </p><p>Rio circles her clit again, harder this time, her hips lifting into her own hand. A needy sound slips out - guttural and unrestrained. </p><p>“God…” Rio whimpers, her head tipping back as her hips roll against her own hand. Two fingers slide lower, gathering her arousal up before plunging inside.</p><p>Rio can hear Agatha’s breathing grow ragged at the sight as her eyes flutter closed. </p><p>“Fuck,” Rio groans at the stretch. Her other hand flies to her breast, pinching the nipple as she chases the high Agatha denied her. Her breathing turns more ragged, sharp moans escaping with the thrusts of her fingers. </p><p>Agatha continues to watch her like that, her lips parted, eyes heavy - as if the image alone is enough to undo her. Again. </p><p>“Agatha…” Rio draws out, arching as she whimpers her name. </p><p>Something in Agatha snaps then. </p><p>She moves in an instant, grabbing Rio’s wrist mid-thrust. “Enough,” Agatha growls, voice low and dangerous. She pins the other wrist next to the first one along her lower stomach. </p><p>Rio wrenches in Agatha’s grasp, it’s not enough force to keep her bound completely. But as she moves, Agatha’s fingernails dig into her inner wrist. </p><p>“No,” Agatha commands, wrenching her hand completely away from her core now, pinning it hard against the mattress above her head.  The move is sharp and decisive - a sense of dominance flooding back like a surge of electricity. </p><p>“You don’t get to tell me what to do,” Rio spits back. </p><p>Agatha laughs. A straight mocking sound as she tightens her grip once more along Rio’s wrists. “You don’t get to come unless I say so.” </p><p>Rio’s breath hitches, her chest rising and falling in shallow bursts. She doesn’t want to admit what Agatha in command does to her. Instead she just trembles slightly, torn between more defiance and complete surrender. </p><p>Agatha leans closer - her voice dangerous. “You want to come?” Her lips trail hot down Rio’s jaw. She kisses her hard enough to bruise, pressing harshly into her lips. Her teeth catch Rio’s lower lip and bite down, sinking down in the flesh. She soothes the small wound with her tongue.</p><p>“Then you’re going to take everything I fucking give you,” Agatha growls against her mouth. “Understand?” Agatha’s hand slides in between Rio’s thighs as she says it. </p><p>Rio’s only answer is a strangled sound. </p><p>Agatha doesn’t wait for more. It seems like she never really expected an answer. Instead she pulls back, scooting toward the edge of the bed. </p><p>“Hold on,” She slides halfway off the bed, hands braced on the floor, ass high in the air as she reaches for her scrub pants crumpled on the ground. </p><p>“What are you doing?” Rio whispers, mouth now dry, as she watches Agatha. She doesn’t dare move her hands from their place above her head. </p><p>She grabs the waistband of the scrubs, fingers sliding into the front pocket. Her deep purple underwear, previously bunched inside - fall to the floor. </p><p>“Got it,” Agatha pulls out a small, lipstick-shaped object and grins, clamoring back onto the bed. </p><p>“You brought a vibrator to the hospital?”  Rio asks as Agatha holds up the object like a prize. </p><p>“Thought I might have some downtime tonight,” Agatha replies breezily, flicking the switch. The low buzz hums between them as she climbs up Rio’s legs, nudging her knees open. “Turns out I was right.”</p><p>As soon as Rio’s legs fall open, she slips between them, pressing the vibrator to her clit without warning. </p><p>Rio shrieks at the sudden motion, her hips jolting up at the contact. The vibration is relentless, even on low and Agatha didn’t ease her into it. </p><p>“Oh fuck,” Rio chokes out, her wrists still resting above her head. Every nerve is on fire, buzzing with need as her body aches. </p><p>“Such a good girl for me,” Agatha watches Rio, smirking as her body writhes beneath her. She applies more pressure, rocking the toy against her swollen clit. Rio’s hips lift off the bed, trying to match the rhythm. Her fingers turn to dig into the pillow above her head. </p><p>Agatha’s gaze flicks away quickly, moving to search the room, seemingly looking for something. Her eyes land on Rio’s nearby stethoscope, resting on the bedside table. </p><p>“Don’t move,” she drops the vibrator. It buzzes against the sheets on the bed beneath her. She reaches toward the table to grab the stethoscope. She climbs up Rio, legs resting on either side of her head as she loops the stethoscope around Rio’s wrists above her head in a loose knot. </p><p>“There,” she says, tightening the knot, “That’s better.” </p><p>Rio tugs against the tubing, wrists flexing. It’s just firm enough to remind her not to go anywhere. </p><p>Agatha returns to pick up the vibrator again. She returns it to Rio’s clit. Hard. Rio instantly starts wiggling against the restraint.</p><p>“Oh my god,” Rio cries. </p><p>Agatha watches her with a wicked look across her face, free hand now moving to press down on Rio’s lower abdomen, holding her still. </p><p>The vibrations are merciless, buzzing directly over her clit. Her body starts to shake, legs squirming wildly. Her thighs try to snap shut at the overwhelming sensation, but Agatha shifts, slipping her body between them, holding her open.</p><p>“No,” she demands, “You’re going to take it.”</p><p>Rio lets out a low, helpless moan. Her body attempts to buck again but she’s trapped by Agatha’s hand on her abdomen, her hands tied up by the stethoscope. Her muscles ache with the need for release. </p><p>The vibrator moves up, just enough, to give Agatha room to slip two fingers inside of Rio. </p><p>“Fuck yes,” Agatha growls. </p><p>She drives her fingers deep, pumping in and out. She curls them, relentless and precise. Rio’s breathing grows ragged. </p><p>“Oh my god,” Rio cries out. Her eyes are unfocused and wide. Every muscle in her body pulls taunt, trembling. Her bound hands twist uselessly against the stethoscope tubing. </p><p>Agatha leans over to watch her face - teetering on the edge as her fingers pump harder. “That’s right,” her voice rough, “give it to me.” </p><p>Rio shatters with a strangled sob. Her thighs seize up, squeezing inward against Agatha as the orgasm crashes over her. </p><p>She practically tries to sit up at the raw devastation that racks over her. As the wave settles, she rocks back into the bed, her chest heaving. </p><p>“No more,” she sobs, twisting her body to get away from the toy, on the edge of collapse. </p><p>Agatha finally pulls the toy away as Rio slows down, her body starting to still and relax. Her hands, still bound in the stethoscope, drop toward her stomach as she curls onto her side, gasping. </p><p>The humming noise of the vibrator stops and the room is suddenly so quiet, filled with the smell of sweat and sex. </p><p>Agatha leans toward Rio, starting to undo the knot holding her hands bound together. She carefully strokes the skin where the pressure had been, turning her wrists over to examine the area. </p><p>“Look at you,” she drops the stethoscope to brush a sweaty strand of hair from Rio’s forehead. What happened to all that control, Dr. Vidal?” She teases but her voice is almost sweet beneath the taunt. </p><p>Rio turns onto her back to glare at her. “Fuck you.” </p><p>With not an ounce of offense in her voice, she quickly fires back, “you just did, repeatedly.” </p><p>“Don’t be so smug,” Rio replies weakly, knowing her words fall on deaf ears. </p><p>Agatha smirks before curling into Rio’s chest, her bare hand resting between her breasts. A curtain of hair falling over half her face, shielding her as she closes her eyes. </p><p>“You can’t stay here,” Rio murmurs, brushing a strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear. </p><p>“I know. Just give me 5 minutes and I’ll get up,” Agatha promises. </p><p>Rio exhales and looks up at the ceiling. </p><p>“Fine, but don’t fall asleep.” </p><p>She’ll give her a moment. Just a moment before she sends her back toward the other interns.</p><p>“I won’t,” her words barely audible and slightly slurred, like she was halfway to sleep already. </p><p>As Agatha’s breathing starts to grow heavy, Rio starts counting ceiling tiles, trying to will herself not to fall asleep. </p><p>She turns her head slowly to not wake Agatha but steals a glance at the bedside clock - 5am. She has two hours before shift change. </p><p>She’ll rest for just a second then wake Agatha up before anyone from day shift shows. </p><p>She settles deeper into the mattress as Agatha curls more into her side. </p><p>Soon, her own eyes struggled to stay up, the edges of her vision blurring as sleep pulled at her. </p><p>She shuts her eyes for just a moment.</p><p>A cat nap really. </p><p>—</p><p>Something feels off.</p><p>Rio’s eyes snap open. The restful haze of the night vanishes in an instant. The air is too warm for early morning, the harsh fluorescent lights of the hallway already illuminated. </p><p>She turns toward the bedside clock. </p><p>7:45am. </p><p>“No, no no,” Rio scrambles out of bed, heart racing. “Fuck!” she yells, yanking on her scrubs with trembling hands. </p><p>Agatha sits up sleepily, the hospital sheets pooling around her waist. “What is it?”</p><p>“Get up. Now. Get dressed.” </p><p>“Wait, were we paged?” Agatha stands, slipping on her scrub pants. </p><p>“No. We’re fucking late,” she gestures toward the clock. </p><p>They finish dressing in rushed silence. Rio grabs her badge and stethoscope, shoving them in the pocket of her white coat. </p><p>She cracks open the door, shielding Agatha with her body, to peek out into the hallway. </p><p>“The hallway is clear. Go find Alice and Billy - get sign out. Say you crashed in an empty patient room or the surgery call room. Make something up.” </p><p>“I think they already left…” Agatha barely has time to respond before Rio practically shoves her out the door. </p><p>Rio waits to see Agatha turn the corner before she steps out, attempting to look as casual and nonchalant as possible. She closes the door behind her, turning…</p><p>Only to run straight into Dr. Jennifer Kale - looking, far-too well rested, and absolutely pissed. </p><p>“When were you planning on telling me my patient crashed overnight?” Her voice is clipped. “He looks like shit this morning.”</p><p>Rio stares at her, stunned. “He was fine. I swear. No one paged me.” As she says it, she fishes her pager out of her pocket. </p><p>Seven pages. </p><p>Her stomach drops. </p><p>She missed seven pages while she fucked Agatha. </p><p>“Oh, so all the nurses were lying when they said they paged multiple times? They said they even paged you overhead on the intercoms.”</p><p>“I...I must have slept through it.”</p><p>“What the hell’s happening to you, Vidal? You are usually on top of your shit,” Jen questions, her head tilting a bit as if she’s trying to decipher some mystery. </p><p>“Dr. Vidal is always on top of things,” comes Agatha’s voice from further down the hallway. Christ, why won’t she ever just do what she’s told? </p><p>“Who the fuck is this?” Jen whips around at the voice. </p><p>“Intern,” Rio says dismissively. </p><p>“So, you have interns doing your bidding now.” It’s not a question. </p><p>“She’s just sucking up. Trying to get a good eval,” Rio mutters. She doesn’t dare look at Agatha. </p><p>She sees Agatha glares at her out of the corner of her eye and Rio prays she understands it’s all for show. </p><p>“Run along then, intern.” Jen waves a dismissive hand at her before pushing past Rio into the call room. </p><p>She surveys the room for a second - the sheets tangled, one corner of the fitted sheet lifted half-off the mattress.</p><p>“Jesus, what the hell happened here?” Jen steps over the mess toward the computer, sitting down to log in. “It stinks.” </p><p>Rio forces a dry laugh. “Night terror,” she mumbles. “I’ll take these.” She gathers up the sheets, wrapping up the evidence of their night into a giant ball before dropping them in the hamper in the corner of the room. </p><p>Jen glances back at her once more, eyes narrow. “Look, I’m not going to report you or anything for your little lapse in judgement with the pager. But you need to get your shit together girl.” She turns back to the computer to begin her day.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>In her 10 years of practice, Rio has never missed a day of work. Until now. </p><p>She can’t bring herself to even call, worried her voice will betray her. Instead, she texts the backup physician for the day, faking food poisoning. </p><p>She doesn’t know how to face Agatha; how to talk to her anymore. </p><p>How does she continue as her attending knowing how she moans when her mouth is on her? How does she look her in the eye when Agatha’s coaxed two orgasms out of her in one night? </p><p>So she decides to break things off. Whatever this “thing” is. It’s for the best. For both of them. </p><p>That’s it. </p><p>She’s going to keep all her emotions nice and buried deep and focus on her career. Clearly, Agatha clouds her judgement. A toxic substance oozing into her that poisons her blood until she can’t even do the simplest tasks at work. </p><p>So she spends her day off hiding in the covers while she catches up on Love Island for an obscene amount of hours - until the light fades outside and her eyes burn from staring at her screen.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t text her the entire day. </p><p>— </p><p>When Rio finally makes it back to work the next day, she gets into the office early, even before the interns. She brings coffee, a ridiculously large iced latte clearly for herself and no one else. She doesn’t apologize for not asking them if they wanted one. She plants it right next to her computer to make sure the interns can see it.</p><p>A clear line in the sand. </p><p>I’m the attending. Not your friend. I don’t bring you coffee. </p><p>Professional.</p><p>Distanced.</p><p>She doesn’t glance up from the computer as her trio walks in. </p><p>They silently plant themselves at their computers and get to work, but Rio can see their suspicious gazes as they type. </p><p>“We missed you yesterday,” Billy offers cheerfully. Rio doesn’t return a smile. </p><p>“Food poisoning,” she replies dryly. </p><p>Clearly her plan is backfiring, because Agatha looks far too smug at Rio’s answer. Like she thinks Rio was too wrecked and unable to walk to make it to work. When in reality she was sulking about how Agatha seems to have fucked up her entire life for a quick fuck. </p><p>“Dr. Kale took over for you. And she isn’t nearly as pleasant,” Billy remarks. </p><p>“I liked her,” Alice shrugs. </p><p>“What gave you food poisoning?” Agatha probes. </p><p>“Does it matter?” Rio snaps back. </p><p>Agatha purses her lips like she’s trying not to burst out laughing. </p><p>Rio stands up quickly, gathering her things. </p><p>“We are going to do walking rounds today,” she snaps as she walks toward the door, expecting them to jump up and follow. No one moves. </p><p>“What’s walking rounds?” Alice asks. </p><p>“Rounds at each patients’ room,” Agatha offers, logging off her computer and standing.</p><p>“Exactly. You will present your patient to me in the room in front of them. It helps the patient feel included in their medical decision making, plus it helps you all stay professional during rounds. No distractions, no making jokes,” Rio says flatly. </p><p>“I think we are very professional during rounds,” Billy shrugs. </p><p>“Totally professional at all times,” Agatha almost snickers. Rio wants to strangle her. </p><p>Instead she turns and walks out the door. The interns finally get the idea and rush to follow behind her. </p><p>As they step into the elevator, Agatha moves to stand beside her, the back of her hand brushing lightly against Rio’s. The contact is brief, but it’s enough to make Rio’s skin prickle anyway. She forces herself to take a half step sideways, breaking the contact. </p><p>She can feel Agatha’s eyes glancing down at her hand as she does, a small angry huff of air escaping her lips. </p><p>The elevator continues to hum as they move, silence stretching across the small room. Only the sound of Billy’s frantic rustling breaks it as he flips through his notes, trying to memorize as much patient info as she can in the short period. </p><p>Rio keeps her eyes fixed on the passing elevator numbers, trying to will the ride to end. </p><p>—</p><p>“Good morning, Mrs. Harvey. We are going to do things differently today. Dr. Wu-Gulliver is going to be leading rounds. So I’ll let her do the talking and I’ll jump in if she needs me,” Rio smiles and winks at the elderly lady in bed. </p><p>That first patient room takes 45 minutes. </p><p>Alice can’t seem to remember any of her patient’s lab numbers and she didn’t have time to write them down. Agatha has to log onto the bedside computer to read them outloud to her. </p><p>Then Rio makes her go through an entire physical exam, narrating as she goes. Alice fumbles her way through it, pausing awkwardly halfway through because she can’t remember the next step. Rio has to bail her out by finishing the exam. </p><p>The patient seems delighted in the extra attention. Everyone else looks miserable. </p><p>Except Rio. </p><p>She’s actually relishing in the way all of them seem rushed, frantic and confused. In the way they have to keep asking her questions and need her help. It feels like the authority is making its way back into its rightful place. She feels in control again. It feels good. </p><p>Billy’s patients are a mess. He somehow forgets all order when presenting his patient’s case, rushing to the diagnosis before he even mentions what the patient is in the hospital for. </p><p>They all seem flustered and tired. </p><p>But by the third hour, even Rio’s patience is wearing thin. She gathers them in the hallway before they enter the next patient’s room, Agatha’s patient. </p><p>“We are three months into this program and you are all acting like you’ve never stepped foot in the hospital. This is embarrassing,” she says loud enough that a few nurses look up. </p><p>Alice drops her head. Billy purses his lips, glancing around to see who’s watching.</p><p>“To be fair, we’ve never done walking rounds before,” Agatha offers. </p><p>“Did I ask for feedback?” Rio snaps. </p><p>The group doesn’t respond but gives each other a few tense looks. Rio turns before they have a chance to think of something snarky to say and starts down the hospital hallway to the next room. </p><p>“Are we being punished?” Billy whispers. “I mean…we are working through lunch.” </p><p>Rio, walking just ahead, overhears and doesn’t bother turning around. “You are interns. I’m not legally obligated to give you a lunch.” </p><p>Billy pushes on. “Is this because you slept through your pages on night shift? Because that’s totally not our fault so I don’t see why we are being punished for it.” </p><p>Rio spins on her heel as they reach the next nurse’s station, coming face to face with Billy. “Who told you about that?” She asks against her better judgement because she already knows the answer. </p><p>Around them a few residents linger, preparing for rounds. Nurses pass back and forth, in and out of patient’s rooms quickly. No one glances their way. </p><p>Billy and Alice both silently point to Agatha. </p><p>Rio’s eyes narrow. “Seriously?” She growls through gritted teeth. </p><p>But Agatha doesn’t answer her. She isn’t even looking at Rio. </p><p>Her eyes are fixed just past her. There is an ever so slight flicker of recognition across her face before her expression changes - eyes going wide, a slight flush blooming across her cheeks. </p><p>Almost as soon as it comes on, a switch flips - she takes a breath and her face grows hard, jaw tightening. For anyone else, it looks like she noticed something in passing, the moment barely registering in her otherwise busy day. </p><p>But Rio sees her more clearly. </p><p>“Agatha?” What are you…” Rio turns to follow her gaze. </p><p>And she sees it. </p><p>There, tacked up to the bulletin board, smack in the middle of the nurses’ station: </p><p>A pair of purple underwear. </p><p>Agatha’s. </p><p>A handwritten sign beneath it reads: </p><p>Lost &amp; Found - attendings’ call room.</p><p>For a second, no one moves. Rio’s mind goes blank, like her brain is refusing to process what she’s seeing. Then all at once, it spins. </p><p>She tries to recall Agatha getting dressed. Tries to recall if she put her underwear on. </p><p>Did Jen do this? </p><p>Was it a joke? A warning? </p><p>Does she ignore it? Pretend she has no idea? </p><p>“No way,” Alice breathes beside her. </p><p>“Oh. My. God.” Billy practically squeals. “Do you know who’s those are?” he whispers, leaning toward Rio like they share some secret.  </p><p>Agatha doesn’t move. She stands there, stoic, oozing fake indifference. </p><p>Rio considers lying. </p><p>Instead, something inside her snaps. She isn’t sure what fuels it but she takes a sharp inhale, her breath catching slightly in her chest. She does it again, this time more controlled, focused. </p><p>Then she marches over to the bulletin board, extracts the pins and shoves the underwear in her scrubs pocket. </p><p>“What is she doing?” Billy makes a confused face. “Are they hers?” </p><p>No one answers. </p><p>Rio turns, now calm as ever. “Let’s go,” she says sharply, walking again. “We have two patients left to see. Agatha, your three year old patient is next.” </p><p>She glances over her shoulder to find all three interns staring. Alice looks vaguely bewildered, like she’s waiting for someone to explain the joke. Billy has a small grin on his face, either he’s impressed or way too entertained by the chaos. Agatha has her arms crossed, chin slightly lifted to give herself the look of cool detachment.  </p><p>The nurses have paused mid-work, fingers frozen over keyboards, medications in hand as they watch it all unfold. </p><p>“I said let’s go!” She shouts. The nurses scramble to avert their eyes, scattering from the nurses’ station. Her interns break into a light jog to catch up.  </p><p>They walk in silence into the pediatric wing and into the next patient room. </p><p>—</p><p>This time, Rio doesn’t introduce herself or the team. She just glares at Agatha, eyes narrow, then offers a curt nod to go on.</p><p>“Umm, this is Chris. He’s three. Here for bilateral 2nd and 3rd degree hand burns and…”</p><p>“You need to introduce yourself,” Rio interrupts, her voice tense. </p><p>Agatha doesn’t look at her. “Right. Yeah. I’m Dr. Harkness. This is Dr. Vidal, the attending,” she offers a pursed lip smile toward Rio. “We will be your hospital team during Chris’s stay.”</p><p>The young boy in the bed is too absorbed in playing with a plastic dinosaur clutched in his bandaged hands to look up. Agatha turns to the parents instead. </p><p>“It’s my understanding that Chris was burned on the stove.”</p><p>The father offers a small nod. </p><p>“I only looked away for just a second,” the mother says quickly. “I had to answer the door and then I heard him scream. He must have grabbed the pot.” </p><p>Rio can see the change in Agatha’s face as the mother talks. Her eyes start narrowing, nostrils flaring. </p><p>“He’s three! He can’t be left alone for any period of time,” Agatha bites at her suddenly. </p><p>“Dr. Harkness…” Rio warns. Agatha seems to back down, taking a step back. </p><p>But the mother forges on. “Are you a mother?” She asks. Then as Agatha shakes her head, she scoffs a bit “then you don’t know.” </p><p>Agatha’s face flushes instantly, the red creeping along her chest. She opens her mouth to respond but before a single word escapes, Rio gives her a dirty look - a warning. </p><p>Agatha snaps her mouth shut. </p><p>For a beat, she just stands there, shoulders rigid, something bitter flickering in her eyes. Then she exhales slowly, her shoulders dropping a bit as she does, willing herself to calm. </p><p>“The severity of his burns means he’ll require extensive debridement while in the hospital. We still haven’t ruled out the possibility of surgery. Regardless, once discharged, he will still require months of physical therapy.” </p><p>“Are you sure?” The mother interjects, already pulling out her phone. “Because I’ve been reading in online groups about honey and coconut oil…”</p><p>Something in Agatha fractures then. </p><p>“Are you fucking kidding me?” </p><p>“AGATHA!” Rio snaps at her, voice sharp. </p><p>But Agatha doesn’t stop. Her eyes are locked on the mother, voice growing more anger with every word.</p><p>“Your child is in the hospital with serious burns because he was left unsupervised, next to a hot stove. And now your solution is condiments? You want to gamble his recovery on some mommy blog instead of evidence based medical care?” </p><p>This time, Rio doesn’t just warn her - she moves. She walks toward Agatha and places a firm hand on her shoulder, unmistakably ushering her away. </p><p>But the boy’s father is already on his feet, face flushed and shaking with anger. </p><p>“Step out of the room, Agatha,” Rio says sternly. She steps in front of her - but not to remove her, to shield her. </p><p>“You can’t talk to us like that!” he snaps back. “I want the patient advocate in here! I want the CEO of this hospital!” </p><p>Agatha steps sideways to peer around Rio and barks out a laugh - high, bitter and borderline unhinged. </p><p>“I promise you, she doesn’t give a shit!” She spits, eyes wild with furry. </p><p>“Enough,” Rio whips her head toward Agatha, her voice coming in low and commanding. Her hand moves from Agatha’s shoulder to her wrist, wrapping around it and tugging. A signal. A finality. You’re done. </p><p>Agatha doesn’t pull away from her hand, but turns toward the door, skin still buzzing with rage. </p><p>Alice looks down at her shoes as she walks, avoiding eye contact. Billy shifts uncomfortably, shuffling his hands from his coat to scrub pockets several times. </p><p>No one speaks as they walk toward the door. </p><p>Just before they step through the threshold, a booming voice comes from behind them again. </p><p>“And we want new doctors!” the father demands. “None of this intern shit.” </p><p>Rio stops in the doorway, glancing back, her expression unreadable. </p><p>“Gladly,” Rio says sarcastically. Her smile is thin, full of teeth and zero warmth. “And for what it’s worth?  She was right.”</p><p>Then she yanks the door shut behind them with a slam. </p><p>— </p><p>Even with the door closed behind them, Rio doesn’t let go. She keeps a firm grip on Agatha’s wrist as they march down the hallway in silence. She yanks Agatha’s arm forward to match her strides, urging her to keep up. </p><p>Alice and Billy scatter behind them like smoke, running to avoid the fight. </p><p>“Get in here now!” Rio wrenches the door open to an empty dictation room - an old closet that barely fits two computers along a narrow countertop. </p><p>The door clicks shut. Then silence. Thick and electric. </p><p>Rio finally turns to face Agatha, fury simmering just below the surface. </p><p>“What the fuck was that?” She hisses. </p><p>Agatha’s breathing quickens as she clenches her fists at her sides. “I was advocating for my patient.” </p><p>Rio scoffs back. “That wasn’t advocacy! That was a meltdown. You don’t get to humiliate a hurt mother because you are mad at me.” </p><p>Agatha flinches. “I’m not -“</p><p>“Bullshit.” Rio claps back, her voice rising. “And if you want to spiral, do it on your own time.”</p><p>Rio starts pacing, hands twitching like she wants to hit something - or grab something. </p><p>“This is why getting involved with an intern is a terrible idea,” Rio mutters, more to herself than to Agatha. “The immaturity, the lack of boundaries…” </p><p>“Fuck you,” Agatha spits. “That had nothing to do with my patient.”</p><p>“Oh please,” Rio fires back. “You were seething. That wasn’t about medicine. That was about me. You’re mad at me for avoiding you this morning. Then I grabbed your underwear off the bulletin board and it sent you over the edge. Just admit it.” </p><p>Agatha steps closer, defiant. “Oh so you are so above it all because you took them down? You could have just ignored them, you know?” </p><p>Rio’s eyes narrow. “Did you leave your underwear in the call room on purpose?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>A beat passes.</p><p>“No.” </p><p>Another pause. Then a smirk. </p><p>“Maybe.” She laughs now, low and mean. “Hey you want straight answers, ask a straight lady.”</p><p>Rio takes a step forward, now invading Agatha's space. “You are infuriating, you know that, right?”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t move. “And you’re not?”</p><p>“Absolutely not.” </p><p>“Oh you are,” Agatha breathes, her voice dropping. “You walk around like you are God’s gift to medicine, untouchable. Like nothing ever gets to you.” </p><p>Rio’s eyes, locked onto Agatha, drop down to her mouth. “You think this doesn’t get to me?”</p><p>“Oh sweetheart, I know it does.” </p><p>Rio pushes Agatha back against the counter, crashing her mouth into hers. It’s rough and angry and Agatha’s hands are already in Rio’s hair, pulling her closer as she moans. </p><p>Rio grabs onto the collar of Agatha’s white coat, attempting to yank it down away from her shoulder. Her mouth is on her neck in the next breath, biting into the flesh then sucking. </p><p>“Don’t you leave a mark,” Agatha growls. </p><p>“Might be too late,” Rio murmurs against her skin. </p><p>Agatha arches into her, her eyes fluttering shut. Her hands slide under Rio’s scrubs, scratching hard along the bare skin. “God, you’re so -“ she gasps, her breath hitching as Rio bites just below her jaw. “mean when you are angry.” </p><p>“You like it,” Rio rasps. Her hands move to Agatha’s waist, gripping hard and dragging her onto her thigh. </p><p>Agatha whimpers as Rio shoves her thigh upward, pressing it firmly beneath her legs. Her fingernails dig into the skin of Rio’s back. “I hate you.” </p><p>“Liar.” </p><p>“Give me back my underwear.”</p><p>“No. I’m keeping them.” </p><p>Rio fists the back of Agatha’s coat and drags her harder against her thigh, rocking her in place, forcing friction. </p><p>Agatha lets out a muffled gasp as her fingers fly to Rio’s shoulders. They dig in as she attempts to steady herself. </p><p>“Don’t stop,” she pants, her voice starting to fall apart as her hips stutter against Rio’s thigh. </p><p>“Wasn’t planning on it,” Rio’s mouth is on her neck  now, kissing and sucking a path along her skin. </p><p>Agatha’s hand roams under Rio’s top again, fingers finding her breast. She palms it roughly, then slips under her bra, pinching at the nipple. She’s rewarded with Rio’s deep groan against her neck, Rio’s hips jerking forward. </p><p>Agatha whimpers again as Rio tightens her grip on her hips, dragging her across her thigh again and again. Her hips grind down against the thick muscle of Rio’s thigh. The friction is dizzying and maddening - the pressure keeps teetering on the edge, but not enough to push her over. </p><p>Frustrated, Agatha grips the counter behind her, using it to lift herself up slightly, changing the angle on Rio’s thigh. </p><p>Sensing her urgency, Rio pulls at the tie of her scrub pants, slipping her hand inside wordlessly. With no hesitation, Rio sinks two fingers into her, her wet, hot heat accepting her easily. </p><p>Agatha starts to cry out, but Rio cuts her off with a kiss, swallowing the moan with her tongue. Agatha whimpers into Rio’s mouth, her hips jerking into Rio’s palm. </p><p>Outside the doorway, footsteps echo in the hallway as a conversation comes closer. </p><p>They both freeze - Rio’s fingers buried to the hilt inside her. Rio drops her forehead onto Agatha’s, pinching her eyes shut, waiting for the click of the door opening. </p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha whispers, “did you lock the door?”</p><p>“It doesn’t lock.” Rio offers casually. Her fingers flex inside Agatha now, curling toward that spongy spot. “Be quick,” she says with another thrust. “And quiet.” </p><p>The footsteps begin to fade outside the door. </p><p>Agatha seizes the opportunity and braces her hands on the counter again, then uses it to push herself up - lifting and dropping her hips to ride Rio’s fingers. </p><p>Again. And again. </p><p>“God,” Rio feels Agatha’s cunt clench against her as she watches Agatha ride her fingers. “Use me just like that.”</p><p>Agatha’s movements become faster, more frantic. Her breath is shallowing, coming in bursts against Rio’s cheek as she builds toward the edge. The angle is perfect now, every bounce slamming her back down into the curl of Rio’s fingers. Slick. Tight. </p><p>Rio groans as she watches Agatha move wildly against her. Every drag of her pelvis becomes messier, less controlled as she rides Rio’s fingers. </p><p>Taking what she needs. Her ponytail is loosening, hair curling at the edges where sweat dots her brow. </p><p>Agatha looks down between them, staring at the spot where Rio’s fingers disappear into her pants. </p><p>“This should be your strap,” she half-whispers, half-moans. </p><p>“Then come over tonight,” Rio blurts out without thinking.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t answer. She just clenches around her fingers, a high-pitched whine catching in her throat. </p><p>“I’m not going to last,” she breathes against Rio’s cheek.</p><p>“Come for me.” </p><p>Agatha buries her head in Rio’s shoulder to keep from crying out. Her body starts to tremble, hips jerking as she bounces harder and faster. The pressure is unbearable. </p><p>When Rio’s fingers are buried completely into her, she grinds once, twice onto Rio’s thigh and palm to send her over the edge. At the same time, Rio curls hard into her front walls. </p><p>The sound of a sharp, gasping cry gets buried into Rio’s shoulder as she comes; sinking her teeth into the flesh to muffle the sound. Rio hisses at the sensation. Agatha’s body arches into her, locking down in her hand as she pulses against Rio’s fingers. </p><p>Then Agatha collapses forward, forehead resting against Rio’s collarbone. Her skin is flushed and trembling as she tries to catch her breath.</p><p>Agatha finally leans back, wincing as Rio withdraws her fingers. They are damp and sticky as Agatha catches Rio’s wrist. </p><p>Before she can lift them to her mouth, Rio scolds her, “Don’t start again.”</p><p>“You can’t resist me, can you?” Agatha drops her hand, reaching instead to fix her ponytail. </p><p>Rio grabs a tissue from the counter, wiping her hands clean. “We have to get back.”</p><p>Agatha adjusts her waistband, smooths down her coat and quickly wipes residual mascara from under her eyes. She resets herself like flipping a switch. </p><p>“I’m aware,” she replies, voice light. She starts to walk toward the door calmly. Just before she turns the knob, she asks, “So what’s the story this time? I was being punished for my little antics back there?” She winks at Rio.</p><p>“You were being really reckless, Agatha,” Rio’s voice turns serious. </p><p>Agatha’s lips curl into a smile as her eyes flick to Rio’s swollen lips. “Funny, so were you.” </p><p>And then she turns down the hallway, like nothing happened. </p><p>—</p><p>Rio gathers the team again that evening, running over their list before departing for the night. She tries to keep her tone even and clinical.</p><p>In fact, all day Rio kept her distance, finding any excuse to duck into an empty work room or any open computer she could find away from people. </p><p>Because she doesn’t trust herself right now. Not around Agatha. Everytime she tells herself she won’t slip up again, she ends up with her fingers buried inside of her. </p><p>“Dr. Vidal?” Billy asks, cutting through her thoughts. “If that’s all, can we go?”</p><p>“Yes, yes,” Rio brushes them away. “Good work today. See you all Monday.” </p><p>The interns begin to gather their belongings and one by one they make their way out the door. </p><p>Rio stays behind, lingering over a few last minute charts and checking up on Agatha’s pediatric patient. Apparently the parents are very happy with the switch to Dr. Kale. Figures. </p><p>By the time she makes her way out of the conference room, the hallway is nearly empty.</p><p>Except for Agatha, waiting by the staff elevators, her bag slung over her shoulder. </p><p>“Finally,” Agatha exhales. “I was beginning to think you were avoiding me.” </p><p>Rio scuffs. Because in a way she was, but not for the reasons Agatha probably thinks. </p><p>“I had a few items to finish up before heading out,” Rio says, moving toward the exit. Agatha falls in sync with her. </p><p>They walk in silence until they reach the glass doors. </p><p>“Wait,” Rio pauses by the door. “Where are you going?” </p><p>Agatha looks confused. “You asked me to come over,” Agatha says, hesitation growing in her voice. “Or was that not…I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have assumed. It was probably the heat of the moment.” </p><p>“I didn’t think you were going to. You never answered...” </p><p>Agatha smirks. “I am now.”</p><p>Rio can’t help it, the magnetic pull is back, the itching desire to touch her seeping into her palms once more. She reaches up toward a stray hair, intend on brushing it behind Agatha’s ear - when they both hear the sharp click of heels down the hallway.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>The sharp voice slices through the air, stopping them both in their tracks. Rio drops her hand. </p><p>Rio turns her head to see Evanora, dressed in a well pressed suit, arms crossed, watching Agatha like a hawk. </p><p>Agatha’s shoulders tense immediately as she takes a step back from Rio. </p><p>“Mother.” </p><p>Evanora’s eye flick briefly to Rio, eyes narrowing at her then returning to Agatha. “Why aren’t you home yet?”</p><p>“I had to work late,” Agatha offers sheepishly. </p><p>“You’re her attending.” It isn’t a question. “Shouldn’t you be making her more efficient or do I need to appoint someone else to oversee her education?”</p><p>“Not at all,” Rio says through gritted teeth. “In fact, Agatha and I were just going to study for her upcoming boards. I’m tutoring her.” </p><p>“She can study on her own. And it’s late.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers tighten on the strap of her shoulder bag, knuckles whitening. </p><p>Agatha gives a small, sheepish nod. “Another time,” she says to Rio, not quite meeting her eyes. </p><p>Evanora arches an eyebrow, “I wouldn’t count on that.” She places her hand lightly on Agatha’s back, ushering her down the hallway. </p><p>Agatha turns to walk with her mother without looking back. </p><p>As they leave, Rio sees Evanora eyeing Agatha again, head tilting to examine her neck. </p><p>“Dear lord, child. What is that on your neck?”</p><p>Agatha’s hand flies up to cover the mark.</p><p>“Just Ralph,” she lies. You know how he can be.”</p><p>“Well tell him to be more careful,” Evanora barks. “I can’t have you running around this hospital looking like some whore.” </p><p>Rio feels sick.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>Rio is just about to fall asleep when her phone buzzes. </p><p>Agatha: <em>Can I come over? Pleez</em> </p><p>Rio blinks at the message, the screen feels too bright for how late it is. </p><p>It’s past midnight. A Sunday night. They both have work tomorrow. </p><p>This is clearly a booty call.</p><p>And Rio knows she should say no. </p><p>She rolls over in bed and thumbs out a reply.</p><p>
<em>I’ll send you a pin with my address. </em>
</p><p>Twenty minutes later there is a soft knock on her door. Rio opens it to find Agatha standing there in a hoodie and running shorts, hair tied up, no make up. She leans slightly off-kilter in the doorway, one hand braced on the frame. </p><p>“Hey you,” Agatha says, her words slightly slurred. “I missed you.” She leans in, lips pursed for a kiss but nearly misses, stumbling forward. Rio catches her. </p><p>“God, are you drunk?” Rio asks. “You smell like a bar.”</p><p>“Just,” A hiccup. “A little.”</p><p>Rio steadies her, fingers gripping her waist. </p><p>“A little?” Rio scoffs. “You were seconds away from passing out on my porch.”</p><p>Agatha giggles, her fingers fisting weakly in the front of Rio’s sleep shirt. Rio hauls her inside before her neighbors get a show. She kicks the front door closed with her foot, catching Agatha under her arm as the intern nearly goes down. </p><p>“Ok, ok.” Rio guides her toward the couch. “Sit down before you crack your head open.” </p><p>“So this is your place, huh?” Agatha immediately stands back up, staggering around the room. Rio trails behind her, grabbing a glass of water and Advil in the process. She hands it to her wordlessly. </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio’s voice sharpens. “What are you doing drunk on a Sunday night? We have work in the morning.” She hands her the medicine and Agatha swallows it wordlessly as she takes a big gulp of water. She walks (well stumbles) into the living room, eyes browsing through the books Rio has stacked on a small shelf. </p><p>She stops in front of a window, fingers fiddling with the blinds. “Fight with my mom,” she admits finally, face falling. </p><p>“Oh,” Rio softens, starting to walk closer to where Agatha stands with her back to her. “I’m sorry.” </p><p>“She wanted me to finalize the guest list for the wedding.” </p><p>Rio stops walking, her stomach sinks.</p><p>“And did you?” Rio asks before she can stop herself. She tells herself she’s being supportive, a sounding board - not prying. </p><p>“Ha! Like I get a say in anything,” Agatha laughs dryly, pushing herself backward from the window. She wanders again until she stops at the doorway to Rio’s bedroom, hand poised on the handle. “Is this your room?”</p><p>Rio realizes that’s the end of that conversation. </p><p>“It is,” she replies but Agatha is already pushing the door open and stepping inside like she owns the place. She kicks off her shoes, leaving them sprawled across the floor. Rio steps over them to follow her.</p><p>“Looks comfy,” she says before flopping down on the sage green quilt. She sprawls across the bed like a starfish, staring up at the ceiling. “Hmm and it is,” her voice sounds softer now and Rio wonders if she’s starting to fall asleep. </p><p>Rio walks toward the bed, pausing at the edge to see if Agatha is closing her eyes. Instead, she smirks up at Rio through her eyelashes. </p><p>“Wanna feel?” She purrs. </p><p>Rio crosses her arms. “I’m not taking that invitation.” </p><p>Agatha rolls to her side, propping her head up with her hand. “To what?”</p><p>“Whatever it is you think you are doing.”</p><p>“I’m not doing anything,” she says sweetly before crawling up toward the pillow, pulling the quilt down and climbing inside. “I like your sheets. Very…soft.”</p><p>Rio exhales slowly, her patience growing thin. “You’re drunk.”</p><p>Agatha bites her lip, sitting up in bed. “Only a little.” </p><p>“Lay down Agatha. I’m not touching your while you are in this state. We’re just going to sleep,” Rio climbs in next to her, keeping her distance. </p><p>Rio reaches to turn out the light, muttering “if you touch me tonight, I’m kicking you out.” </p><p>“You wouldn’t!” Agatha gasps in fake exacerbation in the dark. “What about accidentally? Like in my sleep?” </p><p>Rio shakes her head but doesn’t respond before turning to her side, away from Agatha. </p><p>After a few seconds of silence, Agatha murmurs, “Thanks for letting me crash here.” </p><p>“Sleep.”</p><p>“I like your house.”</p><p>“Agatha.” </p><p>“I missed you.” </p><p>Rio closes her eyes and sighs. “Go to sleep.”</p><p>Agatha hums, but doesn’t press. A few quiet seconds pass, then almost inaudibly, “…you smell really good.”</p><p>Rio groans into her pillow. “Stop talking.” </p><p>“I’m just saying.” Agatha shifts under the blanket. “How come you don’t smell like this at the hospital?”</p><p>“I don’t wear perfume at the hospital. Patients can be sensitive to it,” she explains. “Now sleep.”</p><p>“Fine,” Agatha sighs and turns over, curling her back to Rio. “This is nice.”</p><p>“For the love of God!” </p><p>“Who knew you were so grumpy when you’re tired,” Agatha practically laughs. </p><p>“I’m this close to giving you a sleeping pill,” Rio holds up her fingers in the dark. </p><p>She hears Agatha huff before she finally nestles deeper into the covers. Rio can feel the warmth beside her, just inches away. Close but not touching. </p><p>Minutes slowly tick by while Rio stares at the ceiling, the silence stretching between them. Eventually, Agatha’s breathing evens out, her body relaxing into sleep. </p><p>— </p><p>Rio wakes up to the sound of her shower running.</p><p>The spot beside her is empty, sheets still warm. The bathroom door is cracked open. She rises from the bed, making her way to the open door. She pushes it open slowly, peeking inside. </p><p>Agatha stands under the stream of hot water with her eyes closed, head tilted back. </p><p>“You can come all the way in, you know,” Agatha says without looking. “It’s your bathroom after all.”</p><p>Rio steps all the way into the bathroom, the door clicking behind her. The room is thick with steam, blurring the edges of Agatha’s silhouette against the glass. </p><p>“I didn’t mean to wake you,” Agatha says from behind the cloud of steam. </p><p>“You didn’t,” Rio lies. “I just…heard the water.”</p><p>Agatha cracks the door open and sticks her head out. Wet strands of hair cling to her cheeks. “And you came to check on me? That’s sweet.”</p><p>Rio leans against the sink. “You really made yourself at home.” </p><p>“I figured I better rinse off the bar,” Agatha laughs, retreating back to the warmth of the water. “I didn’t want to go into rounds smelling like tequila.” </p><p>Rio scrunches her nose, “Why aren’t you more hung over?”</p><p>“You gave me Advil and water,” Agatha shrugs. “And I’m 25.” </p><p>“How could I forget?” She chuckles. </p><p>Rio’s eyes trace the fogged outline of her body, the curve of her shoulders and ass through the glass, the water sliding down her back. </p><p>She swallows hard and bites her lip, pushing herself off the bathroom counter. </p><p>“You going to join me?” Agatha asks as Rio stalks toward her.</p><p>Rio doesn’t answer, she just strips off her shirt, stepping out of her underwear as Agatha opens the glass door all the way, making room. </p><p>As she steps in, Agatha’s eyes slide down her body. “Hi,” she smiles, her voice softer. </p><p>“Hi yourself,” Rio’s eyes drift down Agatha’s glistening skin, water sliding down her collarbones, the valley beneath her breasts. “Can I help clean that tequila off?” </p><p>Agatha nods as Rio grabs a bar of soap, lathering it up in her hands. She starts with Agatha’s shoulders, her touch slow and methodical. </p><p>She smoothes the suds along her collarbone, behind her neck. She pauses at the fading hickey along her neck, the one she blamed on Ralph. She presses a finger into the bruise, eliciting a sharp hiss from Agatha. </p><p>“Turn around,” Rio commands. </p><p>Agatha obeys, her hands braced against the wall in front of her. Rio’s palms slide down the line of her spine, tracing along her back, until her arm wraps around her waist. She leans in, her chest pressing along Agatha’s back, lips brushing against her ear. “All clean,” she whispers. </p><p>Rio reaches forward, rinsing her hands briefly under the warm stream of water. She returns to skim her fingertips along Agatha’s stomach, starting to drift lower. </p><p>“Uh uh,” Agatha’s hand comes up to stop her, fingers wrapping gently around her wrist. Rio freezes, thinking she did something wrong. </p><p>“I want to taste you,” Agatha admits. </p><p>Rio’s knees nearly buckle. </p><p>She wastes no time dropping to her knees on the floor of the tile shower. Her hair clings to her shoulders, water from the shower head cascading down her back. Her hands smooth across the back of Rio’s thighs, guiding her forward toward her mouth. </p><p>Rio braces her palms against the cool tile of the wall in front of her. She closes her eyes, letting the hum of the water and the hot steam envelope her as she waits for Agatha’s touch. </p><p>Instead, she feels the ghost of Agatha’s breath on her thigh. Her fingers flex against the back of Rio’s thighs, kneading the flesh there. </p><p>Rio lets her head drop forward against her forearm. The ache starts to coil low in her stomach as Agatha kisses along her thighs. Her mouth makes her way to the patch of curls at the junction of her thigh, where she takes a long inhale before swiping, softly, along her slit. </p><p>Rio tries to resist thrusting her hips forward into her tongue. She groans as Agatha slowly parts her with one hand, her tongue dipping into her entrance before she flattens it along the entire length of her. </p><p>“I want…” Rio chokes out, the words coming out breathy and low. </p><p>Agatha stops, pulling back to look at her face. “You can say it,” she encourages. </p><p>“Your nose.”</p><p>“My nose?” Agatha’s brows lift. She brings two fingers to the bridge, tracing along the slight bump. “I always hated it.”</p><p>“Oh God. No,” Rio’s voice is more firm now, courage building. She shakes her head, water droplets falling from her face. “Don’t ever change it. It’s so…hot.” </p><p>Rio’s hand slips lower, fingertips replacing Agatha’s on the slope of her nose, lingering at the rise. “I want to ride it.”</p><p>For a second, there is only the sound of water hitting tile. Then Rio swears she hears it - Agatha’s breath catching, quiet but sharp.</p><p>She looks down at Agatha to see her raise her chin and scoot closer. Giving herself over. </p><p>Rio places her hand on Agatha’s cheek, feeling her lean into the touch slightly. For a moment, it feels soft, too intimate - like a small threshold being stepped over. The emotion is there, just under the surface. Rio feels it tugging in her chest, threatening to burst free. But she quickly moves her hand to Agatha’s hair, brushing the wet strands back from her face like she’s brushing away whatever the fuck that was that she just felt. </p><p>She takes to sinking down slowly, closing the distance between them. Her thighs part, knees bending to shift the weight of the body forward. </p><p>When she settles, the small bump along the ridge of Agatha’s nose finds her clit. She can feel Agatha’s eyes flutter closed beneath her. </p><p>Her hips roll once - testing - the pressure too perfect.  </p><p>She hovers there for a second, torn between the shocking pleasure coursing through her and the heady awareness of how desperate she feels. Her fingers thread through Agatha’s hair - not pulling, not guiding - just as an anchor. </p><p>Agatha’s nails dig into her thighs, the biting sensation makes Rio hesitate. She thinks about pulling back, worried she’s uncomfortable beneath her. But Agatha doesn’t flinch; she nudges her forward, encouraging her on. </p><p>Rio slowly starts to grind onto her as Agatha opens her mouth, dipping her tongue into her with every roll. </p><p>“Fuck,” Rio growls, her hips finding a rhythm now. “Right there.” </p><p>Agatha hums against her as if she is agreeing, her tongue continuing to lap at her.</p><p>Each slow drag of Rio’s hips grinds her clit against the small bump, the pleasure building. </p><p>Rio drops her head forward, the water hitting her upper back now and cascading down. It drops between them, hitting Agatha’s cheeks and hair. She doesn’t swipe it away, but stays focused, eyes closed against Rio’s thighs. </p><p>Rio’s sharp gasps break into something more guttural as her thighs start trembling - a mix of heat pooling low and the burning sensation of her bent position above Agatha. </p><p>Agatha pushes her nose higher, her nails digging deeper into Rio’s thighs. She’s not just holding her there anymore, she’s holding her like she wants to own her. Possessive. </p><p>“Shit…” Rio pants, “shit.” The words tumbling out between shuddering breaths.</p><p>Every grind drags her closer, the air between them stretching tight, humming with heat. Her legs shaking with the effort to stay grounded.</p><p>Her fingers curl harder in Agatha’s hair, her head tipping forward until it rests against the shower wall, as if she can’t quite hold herself upright anymore. Each roll of her hips gets slower, deeper - chasing a slow building wave. </p><p>Agatha’s breath warms her, every exhale deliberate. She flicks her tongue through her folds, drops her tongue inside of her. Rio can feel her arousal even through the wet of the shower, dripping down onto Agatha’s chin, running down her own legs. </p><p>The tension winds higher, the pressure has nowhere left to go but spill over. She doesn’t want to come yet and tries to hold back - breathing hard through her nose, her jaw clenched - trying to prolong her pleasure.</p><p>Agatha shifts just slightly, the angle perfect, the pressure becoming unbearable in the best way.</p><p>“Ohhh god…” Rio’s voice is nothing more than a hoarse whisper, breaking apart between syllables. Her hips rock long and slow as she tips over the edge. Not in a crash but in a slow, molten spill that takes her whole body with it. </p><p>She lets out a shaky moan as she melts, her thighs crushing into Agatha’s face until she wonders if she’s struggling to breathe. The waves roll through her until she’s wrung out and trembling.</p><p>Finally she slows her breathing, straightening her knees now on shaky legs. The water has turned colder, sending her shivering in the wake of her orgasm. Her fingers release from Agatha’s hair and she steps back, offering a hand for Agatha to stand. </p><p>Agatha takes it, their palms fitting together. Neither let’s go right away. Agatha glances down, catching the slow drag of Rio’s thumb over her skin.</p><p>Rio suddenly feels too exposed, too vulnerable like this. “Uh…” Rio clears her throat, straightening, as she pulls her hand away, dropping it to her side. “That was nice.”</p><p>“Nice?” Agatha questions softly, the word carrying more curiosity than teasing. </p><p>Rio drops her gaze. “What am I supposed to say?” She reaches for the soap, moving to scrub away the last remnants of her arousal. “I’m glad you ended up being my intern…” She stops short, the words suddenly feeling more intimate than she intended them to be. </p><p>Agatha picks up on it too. Her breathing quickens a bit at her words. She pauses, eyes lingering on her. “Me too,” she says at last, voice quiet but certain. </p><p>Rio’s lip curve, slow and small. </p><p>As they step out of the shower together, Rio hands her a fresh towel from a cabinet to dry off. </p><p>Rio runs a comb through her hair, then ties it into a low bun at the nape of her neck. </p><p>When she’s done, Agatha takes the comb without asking, drawing it through her damp hair. She then reaches for Rio’s lotion, rubbing it over her legs. The motions feel comfortable and domestic in a way that feels like the edge of something dangerous. </p><p>Then Rio picks up her phone and the spell breaks. The clock shatters the moment as they are both running late for work. </p><p>Rio rushes into her bedroom, opting for her own scrubs today. </p><p>Agatha follows, pausing in the doorway, wrapped in a towel. </p><p>“Can I borrow some clothes?” She asks.</p><p>“No,” Rio says, tossing her the hoodie and shorts she wore the night before. “Wear these until you can grab scrubs at the hospital. It’s too risky for you to show up wearing something of mine.” </p><p>“Fine,” she pulls on her shorts. “But honestly, how many people would recognize your street clothes?” </p><p>Rio steps closer as Agatha pulls the sweatshirt over her head. The mood shifts, feeling suddenly more serious. </p><p>“Hey,” she says softly, “I’m just trying to protect our jobs, that’s all.” </p><p>Agatha’s eyes drop, like she feels guilty for not thinking of that. She lifts her index finger to her mouth, biting at the nail. </p><p>Rio stands directly in front of her, just watching, the guilt seeming to come in waves. After a few seconds, she gently reaches up, pulling the finger from her mouth to thread their hands together. </p><p>Agatha blinks too quickly. “I know,” she says breezily, “it’s totally fine.” But it sounds hollow. She jumps up to her tiptoes, trying to change the mood and kisses her quickly, lips barely brushing. </p><p>But Rio catches her before she can pull away, cupping her face and kissing her deeper. It’s meant to be soft and quick, but when Agatha’s tongue brushes along her lips, Rio feels herself being pulled under. She tilts her head, her hands starting to push up the hem of Agatha’s sweatshirt. As her hands start to drift higher, aimed for her bra, she stops herself. </p><p>Agatha groans lightly as Rio pulls herself away. </p><p>“And no more of that!” Rio calls, walking out of the bedroom toward the kitchen. </p><p>Rio grabs two travel mugs, pouring hot coffee into both of them and hands one to Agatha. </p><p>“Did you drive here?” Rio asks as they make their way out the front door. </p><p>“I took an Uber. So I guess you are driving me to work.” </p><p>“I’ll park far away.”</p><p>“Of course you will,” Agatha says, sliding into the passenger’s seat. “What’s the worst that could happen though? You get a slap on the wrist?”</p><p>“No.” Rio warns as she starts to drive away from her house. “You get a slap on the wrist,” Rio’s tone grows more tense. “I get fired for sleeping with the CEO’s daughter, my intern, my engaged intern. And I get blacklisted for every teaching hospital. I still owe 300 grand in student loans, Agatha.” </p><p>Agatha winces. She looks down at her coffee cup lid, fingers tightening around the mug. “Oh. I didn’t know.” </p><p>“I once watched a neurosurgeon get physically escorted out by security. Mid-surgery.” </p><p>“I get it,” Agatha says, her voice barely above a whisper. </p><p>“I’m just saying.”</p><p>“I said I get it,” Agatha cuts in, her eyes still down. “Please drop it.”</p><p>They spend the remainder of the car ride in silence. </p><p>—</p><p>They don’t make it two steps inside the hospital before spotting Evanora perched at the security desk, her toe tapping impatiently against the floor. The security guard behind the desk looks miserable. </p><p>“Agatha. Where were you last night?” She snaps, not even bothering with a greeting. </p><p>“I stayed with a friend,” Agatha replies carefully. </p><p>Evanora’s lips press into a thin, disapproving line. “Which friend?”</p><p>“You don’t know her,” Rio hears Agatha lie as she slowly starts to slip away, inching down the hallway in attempts to avoid Evanora’s wrath. </p><p>“I really have to get to work,” Agatha says, but hesitates mid-step like she’s waiting for Evanora to dismiss her. </p><p>With the flick of her wrist, Evanora waves Agatha off like she’s a gnat hovering too close. </p><p>As Agatha starts down the hallway, Evanora calls out once more. </p><p>“One more thing.”</p><p>Agatha freezes, turning slowly toward her. “Yes mother?”</p><p>“That mug you are holding,” Evanora says, a slow, cold smile forming as she tilts her head, “We gave them out as attending gifts last year.” She pauses. “I picked them out myself.” </p><p>—</p><p>Rio should feel bad. She really should. Her careless slip up with the coffee cup nearly gave them away. </p><p>She’d been far enough down the hallway to avoid Evanora’s anger, but not far enough to miss the end of their conversation. </p><p>Agatha, bless her for being a great liar, told her mother she’d found the mug in the attending call room last week. Then, without missing a beat, she joked about using it to trick new nurses into thinking she’s an attending. </p><p>Her mother seemed suspicious but didn’t press further. </p><p>But the second Agatha catches up and they turn the corner into a long, empty hallway, she pushes Rio up against the wall, kissing her hard. Her breath catches as Agatha’s lips claim hers without hesitation. The guilt that was gripping her chest the moment they walked into the hospital starts to fade. </p><p>“I thought I said no more of that,” Rio pulls away but starts peppering kisses along Agatha’s jawline, unable to stop herself. </p><p>“Then make me stop,” Agatha tips her head back against the wall, bearing her neck. </p><p>Rio doesn’t. She presses her lips along her pulse point, fingers toying with the hem of her shorts. </p><p>It’s then she hears the sounds of Billy and Alice, a conversation drifting closer. </p><p>“Sounds like I don’t have to,” Rio murmurs before peeling herself away. She slides out from under Agatha’s arms before clearing her throat and straightening her shirt.  </p><p>Agatha smirks, cheeks still flushed. “Have you been to the sixth floor?”</p><p>Rio furrows her brow. “There is no sixth floor of this hospital.” </p><p>“Oh yes there is,” she has a mischievous look in her eye. </p><p>“The elevator goes to five.” </p><p>“Right,” Agatha says. “Then you take the stairwell to the sixth floor,” Agatha says, stepping backward toward the sound of her fellow interns. “I’ll meet you there at lunch,” she whispers before joining the other interns in the hallway. </p><p>—</p><p>Rio’s not angry anymore, not like she used to be about her constantly slipping up, her toeing the line of getting caught with Agatha. </p><p>Part of her still knows it’s a dangerous game. A game that could ruin everything she built.</p><p>Reckless. Completely reckless. </p><p>And yet…it’s fun. </p><p>More than fun. It’s magnetic. </p><p>She actually wants to go to work now - because she wants to see Agatha. To hear her constant quips, her quick comebacks. </p><p>Then there is the other side of it. The private side, just for her.</p><p>She wants to hear Agatha’s moans as she comes. Scoop up her arousal gathering in her underwear. Feel her tongue against her clit.  </p><p>It’s almost addicting, this pull, this desperate hope that every corner she turns, Agatha will be there - leaning against some counter, scrubs stretched too tight, long ponytail falling loose in an effortless way. </p><p>She knows she’s getting bolder. Crossing lines she swore she wouldn’t. </p><p>Can she run her hand across Agatha’s thigh during rounds?</p><p>How far can Agatha run her socked foot up Rio’s leg before her breath betrays her? </p><p>How loud can Agatha moan on the sixth floor before someone hears? </p><p>Some sane part of Rio screams to stop. This entire thing isn’t just reckless - it’s foolhardy. But the other part? The part that’s hooked, that’s desperate for more - that part refuses to listen. </p><p>And maybe…just maybe, that’s what scares her the most. </p><p>—</p><p>Rio rushes them through rounds. </p><p>Forget bedside rounds, forget full presentations and long drawn out lectures about the intricacies of the renal system.</p><p>She has each intern run through a list of their patient’s diagnoses and treatment plans. No tangents. No questions unless someone is actively crashing. </p><p>It’s blunt. But efficient. </p><p>By the fourth patient, Alice leans over to Billy and whispers, “What’s her deal today?” </p><p>“Yes, Dr. Vidal,” Agatha chimes in, sounding perfectly sweet, “Are we on a time crunch today?”</p><p>Rio knows Agatha what Agatha is expecting - a blush, a flustered excuse or maybe a nervous laugh.</p><p>Not today. </p><p>She looks Agatha straight in the eye, expression completely neutral.</p><p>“I’m starving,” she draws out the last word. “Skipped breakfast.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widen as a blush creeps up her neck. </p><p>Rio doesn’t let up. </p><p>“Now let’s continue,” Rio looks back at her computer. “Before I get so hungry that I start punishing someone.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a small strangled noise in her throat. </p><p>— </p><p>“Put your pager and cell phone on the table,” Rio gestures to a dented tray table along the wall of the sixth floor.</p><p>The room is dim, filled with abandoned hospital beds, cracked monitors and dusty IV poles stacked around. The windows are boarded up so only streams of sunlight peek through the cracks. </p><p>“Why?” Agatha asks. “Afraid I’m going to sneak pictures of you?”</p><p>“I’m not missing any pages this time,” Rio points out. “We are doing this right.”</p><p>Agatha snorts. “Right? Is there anything right about fucking your boss in the abandoned equipment wing of the hospital?” </p><p>“Turn around,” Rio growls. </p><p>“Excuse me?” Agatha raises an eyebrow at her. </p><p>“You heard me,” Rio commands, “Shirt off. Then turn around. Hands on the bed.” </p><p>“Rio…” Agatha warns, but her tone is light, testing.  Somewhere between resistance and surrender. “You think you can control me?”</p><p>“I do,” Rio growls, walking toward her like a predator ready to attack its prey. “You talk a big game but you want to shatter for me.” </p><p>Agatha’s eyes widen, pupils blown. </p><p>Rio stops, her voice softening. “You say the word, I stop,” Rio smiles at her. </p><p>“Engaged.”</p><p>“That’s the safe word you pick?” Rio questions. “Do you always have to be such a smart ass?” </p><p>Agatha raises an eyebrow at her, “Do you want to punish me for it?” She teases. </p><p>“God yes,” Rio breathes, her eyes growing dark at the idea. </p><p>Agatha strips off white coat, scrub top and bra, finding an abandoned hospital bed nearby to drop them on. She finds another bed, toward the middle of the room, and places both hands on the mattress, back arched. Her scrub covered ass jutted out, inviting. </p><p>“Like this?” Agatha teases as she bends down, forearms on the bed. </p><p>Rio walks over, surveying the sight. She trails one finger down Agatha’s spine, scratching lightly, watching the goosebumps bloom in the wake. </p><p>“Perfect,” her mouth follows the trail of her finger, leaving wet kisses from her neck down to the small of Agatha’s back. </p><p>When she reaches the base of the spine, Rio steps back, away from her. She turns toward the abandoned equipment and starts searching the room. </p><p>Agatha turns her head, just enough to ask, “Where did you go?” </p><p>“Patience….” Rio calls quietly, digging through dusty boxes nearby. She throws aside some old linens, a tangle of tubing until she finds exactly what she’s looking for - a pair of hospital restraints. </p><p>The kind used for combative hospital patients. Padded and soft. </p><p>Rio turns back, holding them back up. Agatha’s breath hitches.</p><p>Rio slowly approaches Agatha, eyes locked on her. “Will you be a good girl for me?” Rio purrs. </p><p>Agatha lets out a soft whimper, “Yes.” </p><p>Rio smirks. “So that’s what you like.”</p><p>Agatha bites her lower lip, a pink blush creeping across her cheeks. </p><p>Rio steps behind her, looping the restraints gently around each wrist and securing them to the metal railings on the side of the bed. It leaves Agatha bent over, arms outstretched. </p><p>Agatha shifts once, testing the limits. </p><p>Rio steps back for a moment, admiring the sight. “Oh, sweetheart,” Rio says, kneeling behind her, fingers brushing over the waistband of Agatha’s scrubs. “I’m just getting started.”</p><p>Rio peels them down slowly, exposing the curve of her ass. Her underwear follows, a slick strand of arousal clinging to the gusset until the damp material pools at her feet.</p><p>“You look so good like this,” she says, voice low and reverent. “Tied up. Open. Waiting.”</p><p>Agatha’s thighs tremble. </p><p>Rio comes to stand behind Agatha, her hands sliding along the smooth skin of her thighs. Her fingers brush lightly over her cunt, never pressing, just grazing over the skin. </p><p>Agatha whines, high pitched and desperate. </p><p>“You want this, don’t you?” </p><p>Agatha says nothing, her head dropping forward onto the mattress. </p><p>“Answer me,” Rio barks. </p><p>Agatha turns her head slightly, cheek pressing into the mattress “Or what?” She smirks.   </p><p>The sound of the first spank echos against the abandoned concrete walls. </p><p>Agatha jolts, a howl tearing from her throat before she can catch it. A red handprint blooms across her ass. Rio rubs the red mark with her hand, soothing the warm skin. </p><p>Agatha breathes hard into the mattress, hands tugging at the restraints instinctively. But she doesn’t pull away.</p><p>“You’re shaking,” Rio murmurs, bending down to kiss the curve of her spine. “Still being so brave.” </p><p>Agatha exhales, voice shaky but sure. “You want to be in control.” </p><p>Rio’s smiles against her skin.</p><p>“And I want to see you lose it,” she breathes, stepping back to admire her. Agatha’s ass is flushed and vulnerable, thighs spread and glistening with arousal. “You were wet before I even touched you.”</p><p>She pauses a second, but Agatha doesn’t answer. Rio continues, “Were you thinking about fucking me during rounds?” </p><p>Agatha hums in response, her body twitching in anticipation.</p><p>“I asked you a question.”</p><p>Then she lands the second slap, just slightly harder than the first - less punishment, more possession. Agatha moans, the sound needy, broken at the edges.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha gasps. “I’ve been wet since rounds.” </p><p>“That’s my girl,” Rio praises, her voice a warm thread wrapping around every bruise. “You’re perfect like this.” </p><p>She caresses the heat blooming across Agatha’s ass, then leans down, pressing a kiss to one cheek. </p><p>She slides a hand between Agatha’s thighs, cupping her heat, feeling the slick proof of her arousal. Agatha’s hips jerk, a desperate little sound escaping her lips.</p><p>“So needy,” Rio croons. “So messy for me.”</p><p>She removes her hand slowly and licks her fingers clean, tasting Agatha on her tongue. </p><p>Agatha groans, trying to press backward toward Rio, but Rio only ghosts over her cunt, barely gazing over her clit. </p><p>Agatha shivers, arching into the touch again. She bites her lip in an effort to prevent from crying out. </p><p>“What do you want, Agatha?” Rio’s voice is low in her ear, her fingers still teasing along her entrance. </p><p>“What do <em>you</em> want?” Agatha challenges again. </p><p>“Beg for me,” Rio whispers. </p><p>Agatha’s head snaps toward Rio, her eyes dark and hungry. “No,” she tests.</p><p>Rio lands a third spank, the edges of her fingers slapping along Agatha’s glistening folds.  </p><p>“Dammit, fine! You.” Agatha growls. </p><p>Rio challenges her back by pushing in one finger, just to the first knuckle. “I know you can’t hold out much longer before you are desperate for it.” </p><p>She removes her finger and much to her delight, elicits a whimper from Agatha. </p><p>“See?” Rio pushes the tip of her finger in her again, before slowly withdrawing. </p><p>“Fuck you,” Agatha says through gritted teeth. “Okay, please.” </p><p>“God, you make me lose my mind,” Rio murmurs, her voice ragged with want. “Every time you talk back. Every time you look at me. I want to ruin you.” </p><p>Agatha’s composure wanes then, the confession starting to break her. “Then do it.” </p><p>Rio exhales sharply, the sound half a growl. Her middle and ring finger slide in with no warning - stretching, claiming her. Agatha’s cry echoes through the empty room before buries her head into her bicep to muffle the noise. </p><p>“That’s it,” Rio murmurs, her body pressing into Agatha’s back on the bed, voice in her ear. “My desperate little intern.”</p><p>Agatha bucks backward against her as Rio pumps in and out, her body trembling against her fingers. She’s slick, hot heat, drenching Rio’s fingers, coming too close to the edge too fast. </p><p>Rio pulls back a bit, making her whine. She gathers her slick along her fingers, brushing her clit just once as she does. </p><p>“Can you take another pretty girl?”</p><p>Rio withdraws her fingers just slightly, teasing the entrance before pressing again, ready to add a third finger. Agatha’s wall clench, too tight, a soft gasp escaping her lips.</p><p>“God, Rio…I can’t.”</p><p>“Relax for me,” Rio purrs, her voice insistent. Agatha exhales long and shaky, surrendering just enough. </p><p> Taking her cue, Rio slides a third finger inside, more slowly this time. Her other hand snakes around Agatha’s waist to grind against her clit.  </p><p>Agatha shrieks, something high pitched and so unlike her. Rio feels herself growing wetter not just at the sound but at the sheer power of making Agatha fall apart. </p><p>Rio thrusts inside her again as Agatha continues to shutter against her relentless pace, clenching around her fingers. Rio can see her cheeks flush, tears starting to brim in her eyes. </p><p>The slick starts to slide down Rio’s hand to her wrist. </p><p>“You want more?” Rio murmurs, kissing along her cheeks, tasting the salt as the tears brim over Agatha’s eyes. “You think you can handle it?”</p><p>Agatha nods, frantic with her lip biting between her teeth. “God yes.”</p><p>Rio drags her fingers free, leaving Agatha clenching around nothing, before pressing back in, this time with four fingers. The stretch causes her body to jolt, her hips jerking forward at the intrusion. </p><p>“Fuck - Rio,” her voice breaks, her restrained hand clawing at the bed rails. “I’m going to…”</p><p>“Not yet,” Rio pants. </p><p>“Let me come, dammit!” She practically yells, fighting to hang onto some shred of control. Tears cling hot at the corner of her eyes, refusing to fall. </p><p>“You know, if you just let go, I could wreck you in the best way.” Her free hand kneads at the curve of Agatha’s ass, squeezing possessively. “Tell me, are you going to be this difficult when I bend you over with my strap?” </p><p>“The…other…way…around.” Agatha huffs through shallow pants, trying to throw defiance into her words. “My strap,” she squeaks out. But her hips betray her, jerking and grinding against Rio’s hand, clenching, dripping for more. </p><p>Rio grinds her own hips into Agatha’s ass, pushing her hand deeper, just before she curls her thumb inward. The stretch increases, obscene. She watches entire hand starting to disappear inside of the younger woman. “God, look at you, stretching for me. So full for me.”</p><p>Agatha is wrecked, a sheen of sweat clinging to her back. Her body trembles as heat coils in her belly, equal parts pleasure and pain. </p><p>A feral smile cuts across Rio’s face. She leans into her more on until her front is pressed into Agatha’s back. The thumb of her left hand strokes at her clit again. </p><p>Agatha shutters, the fight leaving her as she starts to splinter into fragments. Rio curls her fingers forward when she thrusts and watches as the tears Agatha fought spill down hot on her cheeks, dripping down to the sheets. </p><p>Rio feels her tighten hard around her fingers, thighs squeezing. She swipes her thumb across Agatha’s clit again, and Agatha’s voice cracks, a strangled moan tearing free as her orgasm rips through her like it’s tearing her apart. </p><p>The wet, desperate sounds of Agatha’s cunt clenching around her hand, paired with the guttural noise of her coming undone, are too much for Rio to bear. </p><p>“You’re mine,” Rio chokes out as her own body starts to shuttering. Her hips thrust forward, grinding into Agatha’s ass, like she can get more contact. “Say it - say you’re mine,” Rio purrs, thighs trembling as a release overtakes her, untouched. </p><p>Agatha quakes with her own aftershocks, collapsing forward as the orgasm subsides, her forehead dropping to the mattress. Her arms go limp along the bed railing she once gripped. Rio holds her close, hand buried deep until they both come down from their spiral. </p><p>Slowly, Rio withdraws her hand from Agatha’s waist. She carefully slides her fingers out, leaning down to press a kiss along Agatha’s damp hairline, before undoing her restraints. </p><p>Neither speaks. They just redress in silence, using a few old hospital towels to clean up before tossing them in the trash. </p><p>They finally start climbing the stairs side by side back down to the fifth floor, where they can catch the elevator back to reality. Rio replays the last few moments in her head. Agatha holding onto control, only giving it over in the last seconds, on her own terms; finally shattering for her. </p><p>And Rio, whispering a confession as she fell. </p><p>They cross to the next floor, reaching the elevator as the doors open for them. As they step inside, a realization cuts through Rio’s haze - Agatha never returned the sentiment. </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p> </p><p>
<span>Rio stands at the edge of her bed, a small duffle bag open in front of her. She stuffs a few clothes in without bothering to fold them - bathing suit, jeans, t-shirts and pants and a shirt that could pass as formal. And her strap. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She’s got a whole weekend away with Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Well, technically, a weekend away with the entire internal medicine program, residents and attendings alike. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The resident retreat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The annual retreat is meant to be about resident wellness and bonding, tucked away in a mountain hotel. The one time a year where everyone lets their hair down, on the hospital’s dime. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Internally, it’s a shit show. Historically, it features obscene amounts of alcohol, the occasional cheating spouse and on a few instances of the destruction of property (although that resident </span>
<em>
<span>swears</span>
</em>
<span> a goose flew in and broke the window). The venue usually changes after they get blacklisted from the hotel every year. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio can’t stop circling back to the same thought - Uninterrupted time with Agatha, outside the walls of the hospital. Hours that won’t be stolen by pages, patients or Evanora’s watchful eye. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s goal is to pull Agatha away as soon as possible and spend the entire night with her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As she makes her way into the bathroom, gathering her toiletries, her mind flickers back to their last time together. The way Agatha unraveled beneath her and yet, how she still couldn’t bring herself to say it outloud; couldn’t admit what was between them - not even at Rio’s prompting. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio exhales sharply. It feels like handling a ticking time bomb. Every second with Agatha is laced with an edge of pleasure and danger. Because no matter how good it feels, it always circles back to the truth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She’s the CEO’s daughter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her engaged daughter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The words catch heavy in her throat. Fuck. Rio doesn’t even know when the wedding is. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The wedding. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Every time she thinks about it, her throat tightens. It sits in the back of her mind as she kisses her, creeps into her thoughts when she watches her come undone. And when Agatha avoided her earlier sentiment in the hospital, a little voice whispered “she’s someone else’s first…” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The uncertainty is the worst part. Wanting her so much and never knowing deep down she’ll likely get to keep her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>__ </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio requested an early check-in. While the interns cram into shared rooms with queen beds, roommate style, the attendings are tucked away on higher floors with their own rooms, situated a few floors away from the chaos. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Moments later, she’s texting Agatha her room number, pacing just inside her hotel room door until she hears her footsteps in the hallway. She yanks the door open before Agatha even has to knock. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck, I’ve been waiting for this,” Rio growls as she shuts the door behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha is on her instantly, mouth against hers, spinning her until she’s pressing her back into the door. Her hands clamp onto Rio’s hips possessively, tongue sweeping in with a hunger that almost startles her. Rio doesn’t care. She wants her here, against the door, the bed, the shower. Anywhere and everywhere. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I bet the hospital CEO would love knowing her daughter’s getting fucked on the hospital dime,” Agatha rasps against her ear. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> bring her up again this weekend,” Rio turns her sharply, pinning her against the wall with a thud. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, ma’am.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio licks her lips, tasting Agatha on them. “That’s my girl.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She pulls back to take a second to really look at Agatha. Her flushed cheeks, swollen lips. Her hair is piled into a bun on her head and Rio reaches up, tugging the tie free to let it spill loose down her back. Their eyes catch and Rio watches her gaze soften and for a second, they just stay like that, wrapping up in each other against the wall. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha furrows her brow at her, breaking the spell. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You just look beautiful,” Rio says softly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lips part, almost in surprise - something raw crosses her face before she quickly drops her gaze. “Don’t,” Agatha’s voice is thin, almost breaking, as her eyes fix on the neckline of Rio’s shirt. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Say things like that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why?” Rio questions. She holds her there, searching her expression, waiting for an answer. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha only replies by moving - crashing her mouth against Rio’s this time. The kiss is rough and urgent, like she’s trying to bury something that almost slipped free. Rio is about to call her out on it but Agatha is clawing at her shirt, dragging it up and over her head before discarding her own. The room is filled with only the sound of frantic kisses, the dull knock of shoulders and hips against the wall. It’s like the tension of the moment is replaced with a burning wildfire of desire coursing through both of them.   </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hands don’t stop moving until their clothes are discarded and they are scrambling onto the bed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Fuck engagements and half-love declarations, as Agatha flops down onto the pillow, hair sprawled out beneath her, Rio thinks, that even if she only gets her for a few months; just like this, it might be worth it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looks down at her from her spot on the bed, eyes half closed, lips parted. Even without asking, Rio knows what she wants. Her legs fall open, cunt glistening in arousal. Rio climbs up the edge of the bed, her body slithering up until their naked bodies are flush together. She takes a nipple in her mouth, rolling it with her tongue, eliciting a high pitched whine from Agatha’s throat. Rio sucks along the pebbled flesh, sucking it into a soft peak. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her lips move to the underside of her breast, finding the perfect spot to brand her. She sucks hard on the skin, pulling it into her mouth until she knows it’s bruising under her lips. Then she bites down, hard. Agatha’s hips jerk upward, connecting with her stomach. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh god,” Agatha moans as Rio licks the wound, tasting small drops of copper on her tongue.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want to mark you everywhere,” Rio groans into her skin, nipping along the side of her other breasts. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck,” Agatha wraps her thighs around Rio’s hips from below her, her center connects with her abdomen. “You really shouldn’t…” Agatha starts to protest as Rio’s teeth sink into her breast again, just along the edge of her nipple. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just like that,” Agatha’s tone quickly changes; she hisses as another mark is made, forgetting her earlier sentiment. Her hips grind into Rio’s stomach, trying to ride her abs as a means to get off. Rio lets her slide along her, slick arousal painting her skin. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pinches her nipples again, smiling as she unwraps Agatha from her middle, placing her down on the bed to move between her thighs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her fingers part the flesh, smearing the arousal around her folds, coating her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shit,” she groans, her mouth leaning closer to its target. “You’re soaked.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her tongue darts out, licking a long swipe from the bottom up. She doesn’t want to rush this time. Her tongue laps at her, tasting every drop that she gives her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighs from above her, her head dropping down to the pillow. Her fingers thread through Rio’s hair, gripping the strands at the root, urging her forward. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She sucks at her like she’s starving, every moan, every jerk of Agatha’s body spurring her on. She wants to drown in her scent, in the salty-sweet taste of her on her tongue. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swirls her tongue along her clit, before sucking the swollen bud further into her mouth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m…” Agatha breathes, her fingers digging sharply into Rio’s scalp. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She sucks her clit again, hearing her breathing pick up. She wants her to squirt again, like that first night, where her eager mouth will be waiting. Rio brings her right hand up, two fingers start dipping into her…</span>
</p><p>
<span>A sharp knock comes at her door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha groans, grinding her hips into Rio’s face in a desperate attempt to claim her orgasm. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Go away!” Rio shouts, her voice muffled by Agatha’s thighs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Vidal! Open up!” The knock comes again, harder this time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m so not done with you,” Rio whispers as she throws a comforter over Agatha. “Do not say a word.” She grabs a hotel robe, wrapping it around her naked body before answering the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jennifer Kale stands there, arms crossed, looking slightly annoyed that she has to wait. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you in a robe?” She tilts her head at her. “Didn’t we just check in?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I...was about to hop in the shower,” Rio lies, hoping it sounds plausible enough. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do that later,” Jen breezes. “Let’s go grab a drink at the bar before the lecture. Might be a bit less boring if we are tipsy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tries to think of an excuse, any excuse, but her aroused brain is foggy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Umm, yeah. Ok,” she stammers. “Let me just throw some clothes on.” Her mind immediately goes to Agatha, still in her bed. She needs her to be able to sneak out. “I can meet you down there.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She starts to close the door but Jen’s hand darts out, stopping her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nonsense! I’ll wait out here,” she says too cheerfully. “We can walk down together.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen leaves the door slightly ajar while she waits. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grabs some clothes from her bag, Agatha still silent under the covers. She changes in the bathroom quietly while Jen yaps the entire time from the doorway, her voice drifting through the room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Five minutes later, Rio steps into the elevator with Jen, donning jeans and a white t-shirt, opting for casual comfort instead of formalwear. She left Agatha in her room and dropped a key on the nightstand, hoping she will decipher her hint. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The bar is situated just to the right of the lobby, near the entrance of the conference room. A few interns and residents linger at the couches, drinks in hand. She climbs into a bar stool next to Jen, ordering a drink and a small appetizer to share. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So how’s it been with your interns?” Jen asks casually, swirling her wine. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio forces herself to focus her attention on Jen, attempting to push thoughts of Agatha to the back of her mind. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not bad,” Rio shrugs. “Billy took a bit to catch on but he’s improving a lot now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He still writes everything in that black notebook like it’s the Bible?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughs, “Don’t remind me. Every time I speak, he’s scribbling in there. I want to throw it out a window.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please do,” Jen laughs, before leaning back. Her eyes narrow a bit. “You have that little spitfire, Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, she can be </span>
<em>
<span>something.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That entire day you had off it was ‘Dr Vidal does it this way’ and ‘Dr Vidal said that.’ It was annoying.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, right. She gives me hell everyday. Questioning everything.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No way,” Jen says, “She may not show it but she practically worships the ground you walk on. Like an unholy amount. I don’t know how you deal with her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio finishes the rest of her drink in one gulp. “I know how to put her in her place.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen tilts her head, studying Rio a little too hard with a sharp, knowing look that makes Rio shift in her seat. “You like that, don’t you?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sets her glass down a little too hard on the bar. “Like what?” She tries to play it off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That she gives you hell. Most interns are terrified of you, of your knowledge. But she isn’t. You live for that pushback.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio forces a laugh, leaning back in her seat, careful to keep her face neutral. “You’re reading too much into it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe,” Jen smirks, unconvinced. She takes a slow sip of her wine, eyes never leaving Rio’s. “Or maybe I see the way you look at her when you think no one’s watching.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The words punch straight through her. Has she been that obvious? </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio picks up a chip from the appetizer, breaking off the corners just to keep her hands busy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve got an imagination,” she says finally, keeping her tone even. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen only hums, like she doesn’t buy it for a second. “You know how rumors go in this hospital. It doesn’t take much for a story to get legs.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lets the chip crumble between her fingers, jaw tight. “I don’t entertain rumors.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen swirls the last of her wine, finishing the glass. “Of course you don’t. Doesn’t mean they don’t exist.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What have you heard?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just that you show a lot of favoritism toward Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s a career move. Given her mom’s position and all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure…sure it is.” Jen slides off her barstool, smoothing her blazer. “Come on. Let’s grab seats before Sharon starts.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio follows, every step calculated, but she can feel her pulse in her throat. She hates that Jen’s words leave her feeling so exposed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hides in the back of the mandatory lecture, taking a seat beside Jen and Strange. It’s the retreat’s one thinly veiled educational component, a way to get the hospital to pay for the trip. Attendings usually spend the time scrolling through their phones, while interns pretend to be interested just long enough to not raise suspicion. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Two rows ahead, among the other interns, is Agatha. She must have slipped in at some point before Rio noticed. She sits now at a long table, hotel pens, pads of paper and little bottles of water arranged at each spot. Rio can only see the pant of her head, but she knows it’s her. Agatha left her hair down, the small knots and twists from Rio’s earlier hands barely concealed, strands falling as if she brushed it with her fingers before leaving the room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Three hours. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio has three hours of these lectures to endure then she’s free for the rest of the night. Free to take Agatha back to her room. Free to finally have her alone again. Free from Jen’s stupid assumptions and her prying eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The lecture starts and Sharon drowns on about finding joy everyday or some bullshit. She pulls up a powerpoint, telling them they should journal - Rio tunes the rest out, eyes still fixed on the back of Agatha’s head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her phone buzzes on the conference table, luckily face down. Rio snatches it up quickly, silencing it, then slides it under the table to glance at the notification. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A text from Agatha. With a picture attached.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I was lonely when you left.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The picture is faceless. Showing only the bottom half of Agatha, fingers spread through her curls, touching herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She hides the phone quickly, dropping it into her lap. Jen and Strange seem engrossed enough in the lecture, so she steals a peek again, careful to keep the screen hidden under the table. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s a live photo. Rio presses and holds on the screen to see Agatha’s fingers dipping inside her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A rush of wetness pools between Rio’s legs. The earlier interruption left her buzzing, every nerve on fire where she was left untouched. Rio shifts in her seat, crossing her legs to increase the pressure. She tries to look attentive. She can feel her pulse hammering, the heat pooling low in her stomach. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She looks ahead to see Agatha, head resting in her hand, absent mindingly twirling a piece of her hair without a care in the world. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She risks another glance at her phone. Another message comes through. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Can’t stop thinking about you. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Her pulse spikes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She thumbs over the keyboard: </span>
<em>
<span>me neither.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>And there is the danger again, the addiction drawing her in, Agatha coursing through her veins, begging her for another hit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The phone vibrates against her palm almost immediately, a quiet insistence that makes her chest tighten. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Let’s leave. This is boring.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s pulse spikes. She wants to slip out, claim a bathroom break. Agatha can follow behind her by a few minutes. The flush is rising in her neck, the ache between her legs growing with every second she forces herself to sit still. She needs to look normal, needs to seem like she is paying attention, but every glance at Agatha in front of her sends a jolt right through her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen leans over, whispering to her. “She makes that joke every year.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The words snap her back. Rio has no idea what Jen is referring to, the lecture long since a blur in front of her. Rio flips her phone face down on the table, forcing her lips into something like a smile. “I remember.” She doesn’t. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The rest of the lecture crawls by. Every word Sharon says is meaningless, even more so than usual. Her gaze keeps betraying her, snagging on Agatha’s small movements in front of her - scribbling on the hotel notepad, tapping the end of the pen against her lower lip. Rio shifts in her chair, leg bouncing under the table; restless. </span>
</p><p>
<span>At last, the crowd rises, starting to shuffle out. Rio stands quickly, shoving her chair back then trying to hide her urgency with a casual stretch. She wants to time it right - avoid Jen and close the distance to Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moves down the center row, arms linked with Billy. Rio slips behind them until they cross the threshold of the conference room, Rio lets her shoulder collide with Agatha’s back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oww,” Agatha whirls around, annoyance flashing across her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry, Agatha, didn’t see you there,” Rio mocks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dr. Vidal,” Agatha replies, too formally. Rio wants to push her up against a wall. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, Dr. Vidal, we are all going down to the jacuzzi then drinks in my room. 305. You are welcome to join!” Billy says too enthusiastically. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen chimes in on Rio’s right, “Am I invited, or is this a cool-attendings-only situation?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my god! It’s like an everyone thing!” Billy notes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” Agatha claps her hands together. “I’m going to go get my suit on.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Same,” Rio echos, too quickly. She forces herself not to fall in step with Agatha as she leaves. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As they drift toward the lobby, Rio catches Jen’s voice, “Is something going on with those two?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy pauses and from where she stands, Rio can’t tell if he’s going to cover for her or just oblivious. Finally, he shrugs. “I always thought they kinda hated each other.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>—</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio makes her way up to her room, quickly pulling on green swim shorts and a bikini top. Then perches on the edge of the bed, waiting. </span>
</p><p>
<span>5 minutes pass. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then 10. </span>
</p><p>
<span>No knock. No text. She hadn’t exactly asked Agatha to come by, but part of her expected it given that frantic urgency they left each other with earlier.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, she gives in, pulling out her phone. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Are you coming by my room first? </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>No reply.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She finally gives up and goes to the pool deck, where the place is alive with chatter. Residents are scattered throughout a few hot tubs and poolside chairs, drinks and joints in hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A few of the newer interns try miserably to hide the joints as she passes by. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Relax,” Rio mutters with an eye roll. “I didn’t see a thing.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She tosses her towel into an empty chair, scanning the water.  Agatha is already there, shoulder-deep, next to Billy and a few others whose name Rio doesn’t care to recall. No clear space for her - not next to Agatha anyway. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As she walks across the deck toward the awaiting water, Agatha looks up. Her gaze starts at Rio’s legs, slowly crawling up the expansion to her stomach, lingering along her biceps, her breasts, finally meeting her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s so brazen. So exposed. Rio feels like her prey. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moves, wading through the water with a sudden purpose. She makes her way to the steps, water dripping off of her. She’s in a bright red string bikini that stretches across her ass where she climbs the three steps. Rio tries to force herself to look elsewhere but she knows her eyes are lingering just a second too long. Rio notices a few male residents turn their eyes toward her, hitting each other in the chest as they do. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We need bubbles!” Agatha declares, turning the small knob just outside the jacuzzi. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she comes back in the water, it’s right next to Rio, their legs purposefully touching. The jets churn to life, frothy bubbles obscuring what’s below the surface. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dr. Vidal!” Billy raises a beer in greeting. “Dr. Kale was just telling us about her craziest patient experience.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I told them about the guy who would inject toilet water to make himself sick.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was nothing compared to the guy who claimed he ‘slipped’ onto a lightbulb,” Rio adds.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait, where did it end up?” Billy asks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Exactly where you think,” Rio laughs at the memory. “Had to be surgically extracted.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Flared ends, people,” Jen joins in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy practically chokes on his beer. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The group launches into various hospital stories, some talking over each other. Shop talk continues even on a retreat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>That’s when Agatha’s hand slides over Rio’s thigh. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nearly jolts but the heat of the moment pins her in place. Fuck the fact that they are surrounded by colleagues - she’s been starved all day, restless and growing more feral with need. The hours since Agatha was in her bed stretched like torture, each one a cruel reminder that she couldn’t get enough of her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought you were going to come by,” Rio whispers, her voice low.  She tips her head back like she’s stretching, eyes up to the sky, trying to disguise her words. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Couldn’t get away,” Agatha offers back. Her gaze lingers on Rio’s mouth, then drags lower toward the top of her bikini top, just peeking out of the water. “I’ll make it up to you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“God,” Rio exhales, breaking into a shiver despite the warm water as Agatha’s hand presses higher, spreading heat in its wake. “You better.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I could do it right here if you want.” Her fingers skim the edge of Rio’s shorts, just starting to wander under the fabric. “Could you be quiet for me?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio starts to protest but her thoughts quickly unravel. “I…” the sentence dies on her tongue as Agatha’s finger slides along her folds, slick with want. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha slips a single finger inside her and Rio has to bite her bottom lip so hard it stings just to try to smother the sound threatening to come out. The jets churn the water into froth, masking the rocking of Rio’s hips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen says something about the lecture but the words are muffled under the roar in Rio’s head. She can’t focus because Agatha finds her clit and flicks, sending white hot heat through her. Agatha only laughs at her misery, somehow steady and unaffected by the undoing she’s caused. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand slides under the water, catching Agatha’s wrist in a bruising grip. She squeezes, hard, nails biting at the skin. This freezes Agatha - a warning. This isn’t the time or place. Rio’s eyes snap up to her, a swirl of fury and need. “You’re insane,” she hisses under her breath. “We can’t do this here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smirks, something dark and slightly sinister, but her fingers don’t stop. “No one is watching you, Dr. Vidal,” she purrs. “They are all too caught up in their own lives.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Somewhere deep within the recesses of her mind, something screams at Rio that it isn’t true, that she should stop her…but Agatha’s thumb continues to circle her clit ruthlessly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mouth tips closer, brushing Rio’s ear as she shifts. “I’ll come with you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Rio questions because the idea is entirely too absurd, even for her. But Agatha is already moving, angling her hips slightly forward, until the jet is perfectly lined up, pulsing at her from beneath the surface. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio can see her try to keep her expression neutral, but she exhales sharply, almost inaudible. She sees the flash in her eyes, the way her jaw tightens and the subtle shiver that gives her away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s entire body tenses, a flush rising in her cheeks as she watches Agatha - her chest heaving in shallow, ragged breaths. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Across the tub, she faintly hears Jen laugh and Billy mention another drink. The world narrows again to the steady, devastating rhythm of Agatha’s hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Earth to Rio,” Jen teases, leaning closer. “You’re so flushed. Is the heat getting to you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shifts in her seat, Agatha’s fingers pumping into her again. “Something…something like that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilts her head, feigning innocence, her finger curling inside Rio. “Maybe she just needs to relax,” she tips her head back until it’s resting on the edge of the jacuzzi. To anyone watching, she looks composed, like she’s simply relaxing into the head of the tub. But her tone is too breathy, too unfocused - the jets reeking havoc below the surface. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha keeps her fingers working inside Rio, while her own hips rock, almost unnoticeable against the pulse of water.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck,” Rio lets the word slips through and she tries to muffle it into the sound of a cough. She’s too hot, the steam from the jacuzzi and the growing pressure between her legs threatens to overwhelm her. Agatha presses again, harder, faster - hurling toward the inevitable edge. Every muscle in her body goes taut - a wire straining before it snaps.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tries to maintain an ounce of composure but as she glances over, Agatha looks at her with hooded eyes, her smirk turning strained. Rio watches the slight furrow in her brow, her shoulders tensing. Rio feels it - her slight shutter, her loss of control. Their eyes lock and for a suspended second, Rio knows she’s coming apart, utterly exposed. The fingers inside Rio still for a moment for a moment as she falls, before returning to their pace - plunging again - rougher, faster. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s composure is lost. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The orgasm tears through her, brutal and merciless heat searing through her as her hips jerk into Agatha’s hand beneath the surface. Her nails, still locked on Agatha’s wrist, dig into the skin, carving into her. She wants to sink under the surface to hide the collapse, her body convulsing slightly at the waves of release.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha sees it too, standing quickly to move between Rio and the crowd, sheltering her as she comes undone. Her fingers twisting in her as she does, sending an additional shockwave through her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio finally slumps against the wall of the jacuzzi tub, watching Agatha withdrawal her fingers then slide them lazily through the water as if cleaning them off. She’s still quivering, muscles tight and she wants to be furious with Agatha’s recklessness. Again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want to fucking tear you apart,” Agatha mouths, eyes still dark with desire. She flashes “10 minutes” with her hands before turning to Billy and picking up his conversation like nothing happened. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The need comes roaring back on Rio like a hungry beast. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Excuse me,” Rio says abruptly, voice tight. She releases Agatha’s wrist and pushes herself out of the water, quickly straightening her shorts as she stands. She grabs her towel, not bothering to hide her urgency. “Too hot in there, I’m going to go back to my room to cool off.” She says pointedly, eyes flicking to Agatha knowingly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen raises a brow but shrugs, turning back to her drink. Billy launches into another story.</span>
</p><p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p> </p><p>Rio jabs at the elevator buttons, as if sheer force of will (and hitting them multiple times) might drag the cart down faster. The lobby hums around her but she can only hear footsteps coming closer to her - the only ones she cares about. </p><p>Agatha easily catches up with her, no towel - her bathing suit still steaming as water drops onto the marble flooring below her bare feet. She continues stalking forward until she’s directly behind Rio.</p><p>Rio can still feel the jacuzzi heat radiating off of her. Agatha leans forward, just barely, until each ragged breath is whispering over Rio’s bare shoulder. Rio bites down on her lip, stiffening her spine in an attempt to maintain some composure or she’ll give them both away. </p><p>The elevator dings and they step in, the doors sliding shut. In that instant, Agatha is on her - slamming her back into the elevator wall, pinning her hands down at her sides. Her mouth traces along Rio’s jaw, down her throat, teeth catching on her collarbone where she sucks hard enough to bruise. </p><p>“You’re mine tonight,” Agatha growls, something dark and commanding. </p><p>The words should feel like a gift, the claim Rio has been starving for. But the word <em>tonight</em> bites back on her, like glass lodging into her brain. Temporary. </p><p>Her voice breaks free before she can stop it. “Just tonight?”</p><p>Rio can feel Agatha freeze under her words, her lips peeling away from Rio’s damp skin. The sudden absence burns and she instantly wants to take it back and pretend she never said it. Rio dares a glance, searching for Agatha’s eyes but she refuses to meet them. Her gaze lingers instead on a scatter of freckles across Rio’s shoulder, as though they’ve become infinitely more fascinating than the question hanging between them. </p><p>Then without a word, Agatha twists and presses the elevator button to her floor. The car jerks to a stop almost too quickly, doors sliding open. </p><p>Rio’s stomach plummets. “Wait, are you…” </p><p>“I’ll meet you there,” Agatha interrupts, finally glancing up and winking just as the doors close between them. </p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>“I wanted to bring you something special,” Agatha teases as soon as Rio opens her hotel room door. </p><p>She’s dressed in a swim cover up, some light flowy gown, her hair still damp from the jacuzzi. Without waiting for an invitation, she drifts to the center of the room, eyes watching Rio. </p><p>“Sit,” she offers softly, motioning toward the bed.</p><p>Rio perches herself on the edge, leaning forward where she rests her hands on her knees.</p><p>Agatha walks over to stand in front of Rio, nearly touching her. Rio opens her legs to accommodate her, Agatha stands between them. From this position, she looms over her and Rio has to look up to meet her face. Agatha hooks her index finger under Rio’s chin before bending down to kiss her. She leans into Rio as their tongues tangle, their bodies connecting. </p><p>Suddenly, Rio’s eyes go wide beneath her, her lips pausing mid-kiss. </p><p>She pulls back from Agatha and her eyes drift down to Agatha’s waist. </p><p>Agatha raises an eyebrow and smirks. Then she lifts her arms, stripping the gown over her shoulders. She discards it somewhere on the floor. Rio looks down to see dark leather crossing along her hips, a deep purple cock jutting out from between her legs. </p><p>“And here I thought you’d be riding me tonight,” Rio’s teeth sink into her bottom lip, half-smirk, half-confession. </p><p>Agatha shakes her head as she watches her. Rio can feel the dynamic change, the way Agatha’s eyes grow dark and predatory. Her hand comes up to Rio’s jaw, grasping along the sides, squeezing. The grip is strong, almost painful. </p><p>“Mine,” Agatha growls, the strap resting against Rio’s knee. </p><p>The lust clouds over Rio’s mind as she shivers. The shift in the air is unmistakable now. Agatha isn’t being coy, she’s hunting. </p><p>Her fingers slide from Rio’s jaw to her hair, along the nape of her neck. She yanks at the root, causing Rio to gasp. Her head falls back at the movement, mouth open. </p><p>“On your knees,” Agatha commands. </p><p>Rio obeys, dropping from the bed until she’s kneeling on the carpet in front of Agatha. </p><p>“Open your mouth,” Agatha demands. </p><p>Rio obeys, her mouth open and waiting. </p><p>“Now stick out your tongue.”</p><p>Rio does, like she’s in mass, waiting for sacrament. </p><p>Agatha leans forward, eyes locked on hers as she spits deliberately onto her tongue. Rio shudders, swallowing greedily without waiting for permission; her body aching for more. </p><p>Agatha smirks, then turns to sit on the edge of the bed. The strap juts forward, dark and waiting. </p><p>Rio doesn’t need to be told. She leans in, licking slowly from base to tip, lingering at the head as though worshipping at the altar of Agatha. </p><p>“Oh fuck,” Agatha groans, her composure slipping as Rio’s mouth envelops the length of her cock.</p><p>Rio sinks deeper, gagging softly as her throat tightens, but she pushes through, desperate to take more. She exhales, her throat opening to take her deeper. The sight of her - eyes wet, lips stretched, mouth full - makes Agatha’s fingers curl into her hair. Guiding but not forcing. </p><p>“You talk such a big game, Dr. Vidal,” Agatha purrs, watching as the tears brim on Rio’s eyes. “But I think this is where you are best. On your knees for me. Sucking my cock.” </p><p>Rio bobs her head, slower now. Every movement is like devotion, her lips stretched, her tongue teasing against the underside as though Agatha can feel it.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitches, hot and ragged, as her fingers tighten in Rio’s dark hair. </p><p>“Fuck, look at you,” Agatha groans, her thighs tightening, voice shuddering with need. “So eager to take it. So perfect.”</p><p>Rio pulls back with a wet gasp, spit sliding down her chin. Her eyes flash up at Agatha - hungry and dark before she swallows her down again, deeper this time. She gags, the sounds tearing through Agatha like a lightning strike. </p><p>“Jesus,” Agatha’s voice breaks. Her hips jerk forward, forcing Rio’s throat to stretch around her. Rio moans against it, hands clutching at Agatha’s thighs, nails digging into her skin. Tears start breaking free from the corner of her eyes, cascading down her cheeks. </p><p>Agatha shudders, leaning forward, her own pulse hammering as she watches the cock disappear down Rio’s throat. Rio is all-consuming under her, trembling and bobbing like she can’t get enough. She continues like that, sucking along the length of her until Agatha can’t take it anymore. </p><p>“Get up,” Agatha commands, tugging sharply at her hair, forcing her upright. </p><p>Rio sways slightly backward, knees weak as she obeys. Her lips glisten with spit, a slick trail leading to Agatha’s cock. Her lips are swollen, cheeks pink, tears streaking her skin. </p><p>Agatha’s gaze roams her as she stands, her head tilting. “You are wearing entirely too many clothes,” she groans. “Let’s fix that.” </p><p>Her hands settle on Rio’s hips, fingers tugging the swim shorts down. Rio bites her lip, eyes wide as she watches Agatha motion for her to spin around. She plucks at the bikini top strings, watching it untie and fall to the floor. </p><p>“Better,” Agatha takes her seat back on the edge of the bed. “Much better.” </p><p>And Rio can’t help it, she leans forward without asking, meeting Agatha’s lips with a mix of desperation and obedience. Agatha’s hand snakes down, sliding along Rio’s bare hips, pulling her closer onto her lap. </p><p>“Now did I say you could do that?” Agatha teases with no real malice behind her voice. </p><p>“I couldn’t resist,” Rio murmurs against her mouth before leaning in to kiss her again. Agatha doesn’t protest; she just slides her tongue into Rio’s mouth with demanding heat. </p><p>Agatha’s fingers trail lower, moving to Rio’s center, teasing, stroking along the slick skin. </p><p>“I was going to grab the lube…But I don’t think it’s needed.” </p><p>“Not needed,” Rio repeats her answer. She straddles Agatha hips before grabbing the strap in one hand, stroking it through her folds, coating the silicone in her arousal. </p><p>“Sit on it.” Agatha orders, her eyes grow dark again as Rio starts sinking down. Rio moans as she takes it all in, filled to the hilt. When she starts to move again, Agatha’s fingers dig into her thighs, stopping her immediately. </p><p>“I want you to listen very carefully to me,” Agatha commands, tilting Rio’s head back up to look her in the eyes. She leans back slightly, elbows resting on the bed. Rio’s knees fall on either side of her hips. </p><p>The new angle stretches her further. “Oh my god,” Rio gasps, throwing her head back at the sensation of Agatha stretching her, lost in the moment.  </p><p>“Listen to me,” Agatha’s fingers come up to the sides of her throat, squeezing gently on the pulse points. “Don’t move. Not until I say.”</p><p>Rio tries to freeze but her hips betray her, twitching slightly. </p><p>Agatha pulls Rio down to her, chest flush with hers. Her teeth nip along her jaw. “Look how good you look. Full of my cock.” </p><p>Rio whines.  Every inch of her trembles, every nerve igniting with want. She desperately wants to move.  Agatha’s hands roam as she waits, sliding up her slides, cupping her breast. She pulls the nipple under her fingers, making Rio shiver, her hips rolling on instinct. </p><p>Agatha laughs at her growing desperation. She dips her head to take one of Rio’s nipples in her mouth, biting down softly before soothing the rough flesh with her tongue. </p><p>Rio moans, something raw and animalistic, and her hips start rolling again. She’s chasing the friction of the harness against her clit. An angle that sends an electric jolt through her, pushing her closer to the edge.</p><p>“I said don’t move,” Agatha tries to still her hips again. </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio warns, her voice strained, “if you don’t let me move, I’m going to come right here. I can’t hold on much longer.” </p><p>“Ride me,” Agatha groans roughly. </p><p>Rio obeys eagerly, her hips rising up, almost sliding the cock out of her before slamming back down. Agatha’s head drops onto the bed with a content sigh. Rio moves her hands to Agatha’s chest, using it as leverage to bounce on her again. Agatha’s hands find the bones along Rio’s hips, gripping, keeping her flush against her with every thrust. Rio cries out, every nerve electrified. </p><p>The friction is building, pushing her toward the edge as she sets a steady pace, riding Agatha. A thin sheen of sweat starts to coat her brow, her thighs burn, but she doesn’t care. She’s lost in the sensation - the stretch, the leather pressing against her sensitive flesh. Every movement is a delicious torment. </p><p>“Who do you belong to?” Agatha murmurs, her voice low and possessive. </p><p>“You,” Rio gasps, trembling above her. </p><p>“Say it again,” Agatha presses, her hips rising up to meet Rio’s. </p><p>“You, fuck.” Rio shivers, uncontrollably, hips stuttering. </p><p>Agatha must feel how close she is, her movements now more erratic, more urgent. Rio’s fingers find her own clit, rubbing tight circles. </p><p>“That’s it…right there…” Agatha ushers her toward the edge. “Don’t fight it, baby. Give it to me.”</p><p>Rio’s cries grow louder, raw, ignoring how loud she is or who might hear her in this space. She doesn’t care. Her movements are driven by the overwhelming pressure, fed by Agatha’s eyes watching her, her dominant voice coaxing it out of her. </p><p>The pet name. The dark look in Agatha’s eyes. Her commanding voice. It hurls Rio toward her orgasm with embarrassing intensity. </p><p>She throws her head back as she shatters for her. Her orgasm rips through her in waves, not soft or sweet but brutal, unrelenting pleasure. Her walls clench tight, her body spasms like it’s tearing her apart. Her vision sees white stars at the edges. Rio can feel the flood of wetness leave her, coating her inner thighs and the harness. </p><p>Rio barely comes down from her high, Agatha still inside her as her hips twitch once more with the last tremors of her release. </p><p>“More,” she whines.</p><p>“Fuck yes,” Agatha hisses, slipping out of her quickly and rising to her knees behind her. Rio crawls onto all fours, the slick still dripping between her thighs. “So greedy.” </p><p>Agatha’s hands find her hips instantly, gripping hard before she thrusts into her without warning.  The force stings deliciously, making Rio gasp, but there is barely time to register it before Agatha is pulling out and slamming into her again. </p><p>“Oh my god,” Rio moans, her head dropping to the bed below her. Her hands fumble blindly for a pillow, clutching it under her as her head drops down. She’s angling her ass up at Agatha, a motion that makes her inner walls clench tighter around her. </p><p>“So tight.” Agatha’s fingers digs into Rio’s hips as she thrusts in and out, claiming her. Rio can feel the raw, almost violent thrust, the way her nails bruise into the flesh. “You look so pretty like this, bent over for me.” </p><p>Rio arches, her hips rocking back to meet Agatha’s force. She wants Agatha to bruise her, to leave a mark that will linger long after tonight. A memory of the way she took her, utterly claimed. </p><p>Agatha slams into her again and again. Every nerve feels hypersensitive, her clit pulsing with every movement. It doesn’t take her long to reach her second orgasm. It crashes into her as Agatha hits her at the perfect angle, deeper than before. </p><p>“You’re not done,” Agatha barely slows down as Rio whimpers through the pleasure. </p><p>Agatha drives into her again and Rio cries out, body collapsing with overstimulation. She drops onto the bed, flat. Agatha places her hands flat on her back, holding her down, controlling her entirely. Rio sighs into it, the pressure of Agatha’s hands on her back, the bed bouncing beneath her. She feels entirely claimed, but whole - her brain is starting to get fuzzy, floaty and Agatha’s thrusts drive her higher, closer. </p><p>Her thighs clench together and waves of heat radiate from her, quaking, shuttering, begging for relief. She snakes a hand underneath her, squished into the bed. She applies pressure to her clit and her hips arch upward into Agatha as she thrusts. </p><p>Overwhelming pleasure hits her again, another her orgasm crashing over her. She screams into the pillow, her voice muffled. </p><p>“I’m right there with you, baby,” Agatha cries out above her, chasing her own orgasm as Rio drowns in her. “Jesus,” she shutters above Rio, her hips stalling for a second before her legs quiver with release. </p><p>Rio’s mind is foggy with pleasure of multiple orgasms, every inch hypersensitive. Agatha rolls her hips again, sending jolts through her body - so sharp they border on unbearable. </p><p>“One more,” Agatha murmurs, her voice low. </p><p>“I don’t have anymore,” Rio whimpers. </p><p>“Yes, you do.” She wraps her arm around Rio’s hips, hauling her up backward toward her. </p><p>Agatha lifts her right hand, slipping her thumb past her own lips. She sucks slowly, coating it in spit, her tongue circling until it glistens. Then she drags it down, pressing against the tight ring of Rio’s ass. </p><p>The pressure makes Rio hiss through her teeth. Agatha pulls her thumb out slightly, then leans down and spits directly onto her ass, letting it drip down her and spread. She uses her thumb to smear the wetness, rubbing in small circles as she presses inward. </p><p>“Oh,” Rio moans, feeling herself stretch around the intrusion. </p><p>“Breathe,” Agatha coaches her through it. Rio exhales, her body relaxing slightly as Agatha presses her thumb forward again into her.  “I’m going to start moving, ok?” Agatha asks, her voice rough with the control she’s trying to hold onto. </p><p>“Yeah…” Rio pants, nodding quickly. </p><p>Agatha starts thrusting into her again, her thumb sinking in with the motion. The dual stretch hits Rio so unexpectedly, pleasure laced with the sharp edge of pain. “Yesss…” Rio hisses again, this time an unexpected rush coursing through her. </p><p>“You are perfect like this,” Agatha drives into her again, her breath growing more ragged with want. “Both holes filled for me.” </p><p>Agatha’s voice is driving her closer to the edge again. </p><p>“Yours,” Rio whimpers, her voice hoarse. </p><p>Her body seems to surrender with her words. Her moans break into whimpers as the overload crashes into her. She would expect this orgasm to be smaller, her body wracked and tired. But the sensation overwhelms her, white hot heat exploding behind her eyes. Her knees nearly buckle under her as the pressure bursts. She screams, the sound tearing from her throat, her body seizing around Agatha with violent force. </p><p>Agatha thrusts once, twice, muttering a string of explicits as she comes with her.  A series of smaller orgasms and aftershocks hit Rio. She doesn’t know where one ends and another begins. She’s hit with waves after wave of coursing pleasure, smaller but just as devastating. </p><p>Rio rides it out, each convulsion stealing her breath until she finally collapses forward, her arms giving out as she drops onto the pillow, trembling and wrecked. </p><p>Agatha withdrawals from both holes, slumping on the bed next to her. For a second, Rio can only hear her breathing, just as heavy as hers. Her hand rests next to Rio’s in the bed, touching lightly but never moving to link their fingers. </p><p>After a few minutes, Agatha stands, walking toward the bathroom.  When she comes back, she has a wet washcloth in her hands, warm from the sink. She settles between Rio’s legs on the bed, gently running the cloth over her legs, her cunt, her ass. </p><p>“You were so good for me,” Agatha purrs as she cleans her. </p><p>Rio sighs, her body heavy but satisfied, her head settling into the pillow behind her. </p><p>Rio is very content to just fall asleep right now, Agatha warm against her side. The post orgasm haze hangs heavy over her head, exhaustion tugging at her body. </p><p>But Agatha is already up out of bed again, slipping on the swim dress cover up with nothing underneath. </p><p>“Just come back to bed,” Rio protests, her voice thick with fatigue. “It’s already so late. We can sleep it off.” </p><p>“I promised I’d make an appearance at Billy’s,” Agatha whines. “Come with me. It will be fun.”</p><p>“Somehow I doubt drunken residents in a crammed hotel room is fun.” </p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>By the time they reach Billy’s room, it’s already chaos. Any plan of a discreet, staggered entrance is useless, the music is blaring, door open as people file in and out. Inside, interns and residents mingle, doing shots at a corner table, beer is already soaking into a spot on the carpet. Jen is in the corner, leaning too close to Alice for a mere friendly conversation. </p><p>“I feel too old to be there,” Rio yells into Agatha’s ear, trying to be heard over the music. </p><p>“You are,” Agatha teases as they make their way into the room. </p><p>They weave through the crowd toward a dresser overflowing with liquid bottles, plastic cups and a few sparse mixers. Rio reaches to the back, fishing out a half-forgotten bottle of gin. Out of the corner of her eye, she notices someone waving, directed in their direction. </p><p>“Agatha!” Some guy calls loudly, jumping a bit to get her attention. </p><p>Agatha ignores him. </p><p>Rio doesn’t recognize him. Not from the hospital. Or anywhere really. He doesn’t match the vibe around him in his blue and pink tie-dye shirt, a blue beanie on his head. Before she knows it, he’s pushing his way through the crowd toward them. </p><p>“Do you know him?” Rio asks, pouring the clear liquid into a red cup. </p><p>Agatha takes a long exhale, her face dropping. Rio looks at her face and a sudden cold chill runs through her. She can’t explain it but she feels like she’s on the edge of devastation. A train barreling towards her. One she knows she can’t stop.</p><p>“Rio, I’m so sorry,” Agatha mutters before turning toward the guy. </p><p>“Ralph.”</p><p>“Hey honey,” He opens his arms for a hug, but Agatha angles herself, stiff, her arms pinned to her sides. He leans forward to kiss her cheeks as she pivots, his lips hitting only empty air. </p><p>“Ralph?” Rio manages, the name like gravel in her throat. “You’re the…” She doesn’t finish her sentence. She expects nausea, a collapse, like the floor dropping out from under her. But the emotion surprises her. Rage. Rage at him for ruining her night. Rage at him for trying to claim her - for existing at all. And finally, rage at Agatha for letting him exist in this space. Or maybe at all. </p><p>“Hi,” he sticks out his hand as if nothing is wrong, “I’m Ralph, Agatha’s fiance.”</p><p>Rio stares out his outstretched hand. She doesn’t take it. She doesn’t move at all. Frozen, except for her jaw working, teeth grinding against the scream clawing up her throat. </p><p>Her eyes snap to Agatha, who won’t meet them. Won’t even try. The avoidance only adds fuel to the fire. </p><p>“How did you know where to find me?” Agatha asks, her teeth clenched. </p><p>“Your mom told me.” He finally drops his hand to his side, realizing Rio isn’t going to return the gesture. </p><p>Rio’s vision narrows. <em>Can Rio kill Evanora?</em> She’s a doctor. She knows how to make it look like an accident.</p><p>Against her better judgement, Rio keeps talking, the words spilling out before she has time to process them. </p><p>“Where did you meet Agatha?” She asks, her voice dripping with fake sweetness.</p><p>“Oh my dad knows her mom. She introduced us. And her mom was the one who suggested I propose so early, after only a few months. I guess she just knew she’d say yes,” Ralph tilts his head at Agatha, a smitten look on her face. </p><p>Agatha flashes the fakest smile Rio has ever seen. Under different circumstances, Rio would laugh at the gesture. But then Ralph steps closer, threading his fingers through Agatha’s and gives her hand a little squeeze. His thumb rubs casually along hers. </p><p>The same thumb that pressed into Rio’s ass not even an hour ago. Rio isn’t even sure she washed it. </p><p>Jealously bubbles up in her, ugly and mean. It burns her chest like fire, coursing down her arms to her fingertips. They itch with the urge to peel his hands off of her. Or snap his fingers, one by one, until he understands who Agatha belongs to. </p><p>But her thoughts are interrupted. </p><p>“Oh that reminds me,” a resident pipes up, picking the worst possible moment as he cluelessly elbows in for a drink. “Can I just RSVP to you for the wedding or do I have to do the official online thing?” He looks straight at Agatha, waiting for an answer.  </p><p>Agatha’s eyes go wide. She drops Ralph’s hand like it burns her, wiping it on her dress quickly. “Now really isn’t the best time.” She looks frantically between Rio and Ralph. </p><p>“On the contrary,” Rio spits, overly sarcastic. “How <em>do</em> they RSVP for the wedding, Agatha? And when is it again? Funny - it seems my invite got lost in the mail.” </p><p>The shift is immediate. The hum of conversations die down, heads turn. Even the music seems to have collapsed into silence. </p><p>“Fuck,” she hears Billy mutter under his breath. </p><p>She sees Ralph turn toward the resident, cluelessly picking up the conversation with him like nothing is wrong. </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha warns sharply. “Don’t do this.” </p><p>Rio can hear Jen mutter from her corner, “Did she just call her Rio?” But she doesn’t have the space to deal with that. Not now. Because now she’s pissed. </p><p>“Do what, exactly Agatha?” Rio can feel her blood boiling, her tone rising in anger. “Why wouldn’t you invite your <em>favorite </em>attending to your wedding? It seems everyone else is coming.” </p><p>“Dr. Vidal,” Billy edges up beside her, his voice careful, “Do you want to take a walk…” His words trail off, as if he already regrets saying them. </p><p>“You know what, Billy?” Rio’s glare never leaves Agatha. Her eyes narrow, venom sharp in her voice. “A walk sounds great.” </p><p>She stomps out of the room, the air around her still vibrating with tension. Billy follows, his footsteps quickening to try to keep up. Rio barrels down the hallway with no real destination, only fury propelling her forward. </p><p>“Fuck!” She explodes, slamming her fist into the wall. The hollow thud echoes down the hallway, her knuckles stinging at the force. </p><p>“Hey, umm Dr. Vidal,” Billy ventures again in an awkward attempt to comfort her. </p><p>Rio whirls toward him, face flushed, eyes blazing. “Not the time, Billy!” she snaps, practically spitting the words at him. </p><p>He starts to shrink away, backing down the hallway, his hands raised in surrender. And that’s when Rio sees it - what he’d been trying to warn her about. </p><p>Agatha. </p><p>She stalks down the hall, brow furrowed in anger as her fists are clenched at her sides. </p><p>“What the fuck was that?” Agatha spits, each word cracking like a whip against the empty hall. </p><p>Billy scoots away silently, slinking back into his hotel room. </p><p>“Excuse me!” Me?” Rio snaps, spinning on her heels to face Agatha. Her chest heaves with fury. </p><p>“Yes, you!” Agatha yells back. “You had no choice right! You…” </p><p>“Stop!” Rio interrupts her, the angry echo of her voice bouncing off the walls. She’s fully aware of the scene she’s causing, the noise, even the potential audience. She doesn’t care.</p><p>This has gone on long enough now. Agatha’s avoidance, the secrets. She wants answers. Now. </p><p>“Did you fuck him?” The words rip from her throat before she can think. </p><p>“Rio!”</p><p>“Answer. The. Question.” She steps closer, looming over Agatha as she starts to back up, her back hitting the wall. </p><p>She meets Rio’s eyes, storming anger building in them. Like she’s debating the truth. </p><p>“No.” She says definitively and Rio believes her. “You happy now?” </p><p>“No.” </p><p>“What can I do to convince you then?” She crosses her arms in front of her defensively, tilting her head. </p><p>“Break up with him,” Rio snaps instantly, teeth gritted. </p><p>Agatha flinches, just a twitch, a crease in her brow - but Rio sees it. The weight of the words hang between them, demanding a response. Still, Agatha doesn’t answer. </p><p>“That’s what I thought,” Rio’s voice is low, grinding. That’s it. The answer she’s been hunting for, without even realizing she was looking for it. </p><p>Agatha won’t leave him. </p><p>Not for her.</p><p>The hallway suddenly feels smaller, constrictive. Like the walls are closing in on her, threatening to crush her. </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha’s voice cracks, almost whiny now, raw with desperation. She folds forward on the wall, shoulders slumping as her arms hold her stomach like she can’t physically stand anymore. “Please, my love…”</p><p>The words stop Rio in her tracks. Pain sears through her like she touched a live wire. She wants to reach for her, to grab her. She wants this to be a false reality, a mirror of a real universe where they are together, happy, without these strings attached. </p><p>In that moment, another realization hits her. The puppet master in all of this. The real cause of her pain. </p><p>Evanora. </p><p>“So that’s it huh? You are going to let her control you. Dictate your life?” Rio’s voice shakes with a mixture of anger and grief. She’s waiting, longing for Agatha to contradict her; to tell her it’s not true. She doesn’t want to know the truth. She wants a different ending. </p><p>“I don’t have a choice,” Agatha whispers, barely audible, the finality of it cutting Rio’s chest in two. </p><p>“Seems I’m not the only one concerned about her job,” Rio rolls her eyes. </p><p>“That’s not fair.”</p><p>“So you are going to spend your entire life in a fake marriage that you don’t want? Being unhappy?” Rio’s voice drips with accusation, disbelief and under it all - pain. </p><p>“We can’t always get what we want,” Agatha murmurs, her voice steady but the words hollow. “Sometimes we are just dealing with the cards we are dealt.”</p><p>“This doesn’t even sound like you,” Rio steps closer, her index finger hooking under Agatha’s chin, forcing her to look up at her. “Is that a line that mommy fed you?” </p><p>“Fuck you!” Agatha jerks back, yanking her chin free. “I’m not doing this.” She shoves past Rio, shoulder colliding into her. “Aren’t you supposed to be my attending? Helping me in my professional career? Where does lesbian life advice play into that?” Agatha spits the words like venom.</p><p>“Then I’m an idiot for thinking I was more than that,” Rio retaliates. </p><p>The sudden ping of elevator doors opening breaks through the tension. Two hotel security officers step out, scanning the hallway. </p><p>“Excuse me,” one of them says, an older man in a stretched polo, pot belly stretching the fabric. He looks out of breath, despite taking an elevator ride to reach them. “We received reports of a disturbance.” </p><p>Rio straightens, falling into a professional mode instantly. She flashes a toothy, polite smile even though every fiber of her body is still humming with tension. “We were just leaving,” she says smoothly. </p><p>“She was just leaving,” Agatha corrects, turning down the hallway in the opposite direction. Her posture rigid with quiet defiance. </p><p>“Agatha?” Rio calls, desperation rising quickly. “Agatha!” She calls again, but Agatha doesn’t slow, she doesn’t look back. </p><p>Just before Agatha disappears around the threshold back to the hotel room, Rio’s frustration boils over. “You are a coward!” She yells, her words full of frustration, heartbreak and barely contained fury. </p><p>No response awaits her. </p><p>Rio pivots, shoulders tight, and begins to leave. She steals one last glance back at the party door. And swears she sees a flicker of movement. The back of Jen’s head, darting back inside. </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p> </p><p><span>Rio rolls over in bed and groans, the motion sending a sharp pulse of pain through her skull. As her body stirs fully awake, memories crash into her. She’s still in her hotel room. Alone. Her hangover slams into her reminding her that after her fall out with Agatha, she went straight to the hotel bar, drowning her sorrows alone while the party continued upstairs. </span></p><p><span>The details are a bit fuzzy. Multiple glasses of tequila, an embarrassing amount of tears and endless glances at her phone, begging it to buzz. </span></p><p><span>At least she remembers she was alone. Right now, she doesn’t know if that makes her feel better or worse. </span></p><p><span>Agatha’s strap still sits discarded on the floor of her hotel room. She didn’t even bother to wash it. For a moment, Rio thinks about throwing it away, but she won’t leave that horror for the housekeepers to find. </span></p><p><span>Dragging herself upright, she stumbles to the bathroom. The light is blinding, worsening her headache and the sudden motion leaves her stomach revolting. She heaves into the toilet until her throat is raw. </span></p><p><span>The shower that follows is brutally hot but it does nothing to strip away the memory of Agatha. Her body aches with it - the purple bruises along her hips where her fingers clamped tight, the soreness between her thighs. She hates it. Hates that her body remembers what her mind is screaming to forget. </span></p><p><span>She shoves on a pair of sunglasses as she grabs her bag to leave, hoping anyone who sees her is also too hung over to recognize her.</span></p><p><span>As she climbs into the elevator, mercifully, it’s empty. She slouches into the back corner. </span></p><p><span>It lowers two floors before it stops, the doors opening on the third floor. </span></p><p><span>Jen walks in. Eyes down. Rio pretends not to notice she’s wearing the same clothes from last night. </span></p><p><span>“Rio,” she greets her, her voice a combination of pity and warning. “Do you want to talk about it? I mean, I can’t say I didn’t warn you but…”</span></p><p><span>“Just stop, Jen.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m just saying, I think that…”</span></p><p><span>Rio cuts her off again. “Oh yes, please tell me all about sleeping with an intern! That must be fascinating coming from you; or did you not just leave Alice’s bed?” </span></p><p><span>Jen freezes, eyes wide. “What? How did you..?”</span></p><p><span>“You got in at the third floor,” Rio spits. “Where the residents were staying.” Rio looks her up and down. “And same clothes.” </span></p><p><span>Color rushes to Jen’s cheeks. “Fuck, I wasn’t very sly, was I?” </span></p><p><span>“Didn’t even last a day.” Rio folds her arms. “So no, I don’t need your pity today.”</span></p><p><span>Her words are meant to harm. And they do. </span></p><p><span>The rest of the elevator ride is silent. </span></p><p><span>—</span></p><p><span>By the next morning, Rio wants to call in sick. Again. </span></p><p><span>Her body is practically begging for it. She tells herself it’s a prolonged hangover. A two day age-related punishment. But she knows better. This isn’t her body. It’s her mind. Emotional whiplash. The fallout of crashing out over someone half her age. </span></p><p><span>Calling out would feel like surrendering to those feelings. Like letting Agatha win.</span></p><p><span>No. </span></p><p><span>Today she’ll walk into that hospital polished and professional. Every ounce of her will scream control. </span></p><p><span>The thoughts jolt her with deja vu. The same mentality when she first slept with Agatha. Convincing herself she could compartmentalize. </span></p><p><span>Except this time, it’s not because of a slip up.  </span></p><p><span>It’s because everything’s changed. </span></p><p><span>For those two days, the fight runs like a film reel that Rio can’t turn off. Every word. Every pause. Every movement of Agatha’s mouth. She drags the memories through her mind until they’re raw and frayed. </span></p><p><span>Agatha telling her she won’t leave him. </span></p><p><span>Rio spitting back that she’s a coward. And God, that one even cuts her, jagged and unhealed. </span></p><p><span>Then the silence. And the leaving. </span></p><p><span>Cold and empty. </span></p><p><span>One thing sticks, stubborn and impossible to shake. </span></p><p><em><span>Please, my love.</span></em></p><p><span>My love.</span></p><p><span>Love. </span></p><p><span>The words dig in, relentless. Not a mistake, right? Something Agatha tossed out casually or was it really Agatha’s true feelings slipping through in a moment of desperation?</span></p><p><span>Rio tells herself it doesn’t matter. Love means nothing if the path of Agatha’s life has already been carved in stone. And yet - the thought presses on her chest, heavy and immoveable. </span></p><p><span>She fights to try to sleep that night - tossing and turning until she finally falls asleep and dreams only of </span><em><span>her. </span></em><span>By morning, she feels hollowed out, starting in on the caffeine intake before her alarm even rings.</span></p><p><span>She hauls the door to the conference room open, loud and aggressive. </span></p><p><span>Billy and Alice’s eyes dart up, flinching as if ready to shield themselves from the impending battle.</span></p><p><span>But Agatha doesn’t even look up. </span></p><p><span>It’s deliberate, calculated. Agatha spends the morning breezing past her in the conference room without a glance, snatching her patient list without a word. </span></p><p><span>And when she finally is forced to speak, it’s with a clipped, dismissive tone she would use with a stranger. Not someone she shared a bed with only days ago. Underneath the chill of Agatha’s gaze, Rio still wants to feel the heat of what they once were. But that seems impossibly far away now. </span></p><p><span>Morning rounds are eerily silent except for the sounds of clicking keyboards and the scratching of pens. </span></p><p><span>Rio struggles to concentrate on her computer, lab numbers blur, sentences repeat and dissolve on her screen. She’s chosen her seat at the conference room table with precision - close enough to study Agatha, to catch the smallest flickers of her expressions. Every furrow of her brow, every upturn of her lip. </span></p><p><span>And she hates it. </span></p><p><span>A little part of her hates that in only a few months, Agatha turned her world upside down. Made her question everything she knew, stripped her of certainty - made her want to crawl on her hands and knees to get to her. </span></p><p><span>She hates that she can’t have her - not in the way she wants her. Wholly. Unrestrained. Free. </span></p><p><span>She hates how much she might love…</span></p><p><em><span>No</span></em><span>. She can’t think that. Not here. Not now. Maybe not ever. </span></p><p><span>The only thing that became wildly clear during that resident retreat weekend, was that Agatha will choose him. And her mother. Over Rio. </span></p><p><span>That is something she is still grappling with as she cues up the next patient for rounds. </span></p><p><span>“This patient admitted last night for an MI needs to be optimized on medical therapy. Who can tell me what needs to be added to his regimen?” Rio forces herself to switch her focus back on work, even if her gaze lingers on Agatha a second too long. </span></p><p><span>The room is silent again.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha?” Rio probes, even though it’s not her patient. Or her turn to answer.</span></p><p><span>“Ask cardiology,” Agatha says flippantly.</span></p><p><span>“I’m sure they know the answer, but we are here for your education,” Rio snaps. </span></p><p><span>“Fine.” Agatha grates. “He’s already on a statin, but it needs to be high dose. And we will add a beta blocker, ace-inhibitor and aspirin.” </span></p><p><span>“Now was that so hard?” Rio’s words spit sarcasm.</span></p><p><span>The look Agatha gives her could kill. “Am I done? I’d like to go back to charting.” </span></p><p><span>“No, you aren’t. There is a patient in the emergency room that we need to admit.”</span></p><p><span>“Sounds like Alice can do it,” Agatha snaps in deliberate defiance. </span></p><p><span>“You are doing it.” Rio doesn’t leave room for argument, but Agatha does anyway. </span></p><p><span>“And if I don’t?” She challenges. </span></p><p><span>“I put on your evaluation that I recommend you fail the rotation.”</span></p><p><span>She hears Alice gasp. </span></p><p><span>Agatha slams her hands down on the table as she shoves her chair back, the scrape loud. She stalks toward the door, shoulders stiff. </span></p><p><span>“Don’t be too dramatic or anything,” Rio taunts as she follows her out the door.</span></p><p><span>The emergency room is filled with the usual buzz of elderly patients dozing under fluorescent lights, a drunk man shouting for a turkey sandwich and the sharp smell of antiseptic mixing with old, stale coffee. </span></p><p><span>Rio lets Agatha sign into the workstation, giving her space to click through the chart before she sinks down into the chair next to her, angling just so that her thigh grazes hers. Usually, the touch would earn her a quick quip, a sly sideways glance, or a promise of later. </span></p><p><span>This time, Agatha simply moves away. “Don’t,” she breathes. But she doesn’t sound angry, just…sad. </span></p><p><span>Rio bites her lip and scoots away, leaving a strip of cold space between them. They dissolve into silence, the sounds of the emergency room chaos constantly swirling around them. </span></p><p><span>Rio’s leg bounces beneath the work station table, a restless pulse of energy. Her fingernail taps on the mouse; a relentless sharp clicking noise cutting through their silence. </span></p><p><span>“Can you stop?” Agatha suddenly snaps, glaring at her. </span></p><p><span>“I’m not doing anything.”</span></p><p><span>“Yes, you are. You are fidgeting and I’m trying to concentrate.” </span></p><p><span>Rio picks up a pen instead, her thumb pressing the plunger up and down endlessly. She flips it a few times in her fingers, until it slips, flying sideways to land next to her. </span></p><p><span>“For fucks sake!” Agatha practically yells. </span></p><p><span>“So that’s what it takes for you to talk to me?” Rio lifts an eyebrow as she picks up the pen from its spot on Agatha’s keyboard. “Good to know.”</span></p><p><span>“What do you want from me, Rio?” </span></p><p><span>“I want you to talk to me.”</span></p><p><span>“You mentioned that. But you ask me questions you don’t want the answers to then get mad when I tell the truth.” </span></p><p><span>Rio’s voice drops to a low whisper. “You called me your love.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha freezes, her eyes widening silently. Then she stiffens her jaw. “You heard that.”</span></p><p><span>“Do you want to take it back?”</span></p><p><span>“It doesn’t matter. It can’t…”</span></p><p><span>“It matters to me,” Rio’s voice breaks slightly. </span></p><p><span>“Rio….” Agatha says her name like a warning. “Don’t. Don’t do that. This…we were having fun. That’s it, right?”</span></p><p><span>The words feel like a dagger, twisting into her skin. As much as she wants to pretend there is more. This weekend showed her she was a fool. Grasping at straws of a life that can never happen. Proof she was lying to herself. </span></p><p><span>“Can we focus on the patient now?” Agatha pleads. “Please?”</span></p><p><span>“Yeah…” the words come out small. “Yeah, we can.”</span></p><p><span>Then Rio leans forward, squinting at the patient’s chart on the screen. A 21-year old female here for abdominal pain found to have suspected ectopic pregnancy. </span></p><p><span>Then at the bottom of the chart: </span><em><span>mother at bedside, refusing intervention.</span></em></p><p><span>Fuck.</span></p><p><span>The universe is laughing at her. </span></p><p><span>—</span></p><p><span>“Agatha, what’s your plan?” She asks as they finish reviewing the patient. </span></p><p><span>The tension sits just below the surface, a volcano ready to erupt. But God dammit, one thing years of medicine has taught her is how to ignore all her shit in the moment and focus on the patient. </span></p><p><span>“We need to call OB. They can determine if she needs surgical or medical intervention,” Agatha’s tone shifts instantly into professional mode. Her back straightens as she adjusts her white coat and stands. </span></p><p><span>“Right,” Rio rises to follow. “Let’s make sure the family understands the seriousness of the situation. There is a note that the mother is refusing treatment for her daughter.” </span></p><p><span>A flicker of color drains from Agatha’s face. “If the pregnancy continues, the fallopian tube could rupture, causing life-threatening hemorrhage.” </span></p><p><span>“Exactly. It’s not a matter of </span><em><span>if</span></em><span>, it’s </span><em><span>when,</span></em><span>” Rio pauses outside the door. “I’m going to let you take the lead.” </span></p><p><span>As they step inside, a frail brunette sits in the bed, her knees drawn up to her chest. Her mother is pacing the room, phone in hand, texting furiously. </span></p><p><span>“Finally,” the mother snaps, before they can introduce themselves. “We have been waiting forever. She feels better now; she’s ready to discharge.” </span></p><p><span>“Ok…” Agatha falters for a breath, then steadies. “I’m Dr. Harkness. This is Dr. Vidal. I wanted to make sure you understand what’s happening with Carol.” </span></p><p><span>“I know perfectly well,” the mother’s eyes flash up, filled with hostility, “You doctors are trying to push her into an abortion!” </span></p><p><span>Agatha inhales sharply. “Your daughter’s pregnancy is ectopic. It is implanted in her fallopian tube. To try to save her life, the pregnancy has to be terminated.”</span></p><p><span>Rio gives Agatha a discreet nudge, in the side, urging her to focus on the patient rather than the mother. </span></p><p><span>“Carol,” Agatha starts as she turns to the patient. “Do you understand what I’m telling you.”</span></p><p><span>The patient looks between her mother and Agatha before she gives the smallest of nods. </span></p><p><span>But the mother cuts in again, her voice rising, “See, I knew it! That’s all these liberal types want to do is push for abortions! I bet you are going to make some vaccine with her baby’s parts!” The mother starts yelling now, her words venomous. </span></p><p><span>Rio braces herself for Agatha to snap back - to bear her teeth and rip into the mother until Rio has to drag her from the room. Like she’s seen her do before. But she doesn’t. She just….backs down. </span></p><p><span>“Ok. Well…umm..I guess…” Her voice falters, her words falling over themselves. “I can get discharge paperwork…”</span></p><p><span>“Damn right you will,” the mother says triumphantly. Agatha’s shoulders slump slightly, her frame seeming to curl inward. </span></p><p><span>Rio can see the defeat on her face, the way she folds and caves under the pressure - it’s so unlike her usual. The weight of a mother’s fury pressing her down, forcing her to cave. </span></p><p><span>Suddenly, she feels like an ass for putting her in this room, this situation. </span></p><p><span>“Carol,” Rio steps in, her tone crips. “You are over 18. You can make your own medical decision. Technically, your mother doesn’t get to decide for you.” </span></p><p><span>“Excuse me!” the mother snaps. “I am still her mother, despite her age!” </span></p><p><span>“No,” comes a small voice from the hospital bed. “Mom, I know this is your religion or whatever, but it’s not mine. I’m not going to die because you don’t understand.” She pauses, watching the redness rise in her mother’s face. “I know I need to terminate.”</span></p><p><span>“We will go call OB,” Rio says definitely. She pulls Agatha gently by the shoulder, ushering her out the door. </span></p><p><span>Out in the hallway, she closes the door just enough to create a buffer from the mother’s yelling inside. She starts walking wordlessly through the emergency room halls, out the side door and into the crisp air. </span></p><p><span>Agatha follows silently, her shoulders tight, her hands stuffed into her white coat pockets. </span></p><p><span>When they stop in a courtyard, the same one where Agatha faced her first patient death all those weeks ago, Rio finally turns to her.</span></p><p><span>“Hey…” Rio’s voice is careful. “That wasn’t you back there.” She keeps a measured distance, letting Agatha absorb her words. “You don’t have to cave to her. You are still the doctor in charge.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha swallows. “I know…I just didn’t want to make her angrier." She still sounds so small. </span></p><p><span>For a beat, they stand there, the cool evening air cutting through their white coats. Rio draws her arms around herself, trying to stay warm. </span></p><p><span>“This isn’t about the patient anymore, is it?” Rio tests. “She’s really got a chokehold on you, doesn’t she?” She doesn’t mean the words to come out harsh, but they do. Bitter resentment toward Evanora flares in her chest. </span></p><p><span>Agatha’s nostrils flare at her words, “She’s still my mother, Rio,” she bites back. </span></p><p><span>“But she doesn’t have to be in charge of you,” Rio tries to keep her voice controlled but she feels herself growing angry at the situation. </span></p><p><span>Agatha doesn’t respond, she just purses her lips. </span></p><p><span>And Rio can’t help it, the frustration from the other night comes right back to the surface - angry and hot. “Are you really going to marry him?” </span></p><p><span>“Do you think I have a choice?” Agatha snaps instantly. </span></p><p><span>“Yes, you do.”</span></p><p><span>“Ha!” Agatha laughs, something bitter. “I don’t. This is so much bigger than you know. You think I can run home and tell her ‘Hey mom! Screw this engagement, I’ve been fucking my attending instead? How do you think that would go over?”</span></p><p><span>“I’m not saying to do that, Agatha!” Rio feels her voice rising. “But you can tell her no.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha shakes her head bitterly. “I go against my mother’s wishes and she gets me kicked out of the program. And blacklisted from every residency in the country. Then what?” She spits, her cheeks flushing with anger as she balls her fists at her sides. “I’m a failed doctor. I can’t get a job or a board certification. Are you going to take me in then like some stray cat?” </span></p><p><em><span>Yes</span></em><span>, the word pulses inside Rio like a heartbeat. Instead of saying it, she steps closer, unable to stop herself despite all their fighting. Her hands frame Agatha’s face, thumbs brushing against flushed cheeks. She feels Agatha slowly soften in the grasp, her fists loosening. </span></p><p><span>And God, the sight of those unshed tears in Agatha’s eyes nearly ruins her. </span></p><p><span>“You are in charge of your life. You make the decisions that matter,” she tries to tell her, but Agatha instantly scoffs at her words. </span></p><p><span>“You say that,” Agatha starts, “but it doesn’t feel like that when she’s standing over me, Rio.” </span></p><p><span>“I know,” Rio tilts her head, like she’s helpless against the pull between them. “Just…” </span></p><p><span>Her words fail, and fuck it, despite everything the magnetic force gets her again and she closes the distance, kissing her gently, testing. </span></p><p><span>Agatha exhales into her mouth like a surrender, slowly melting into her like the current pulls her just as much as it does Rio. She starts pressing back, hungry. As her tongue slips into Rio’s mouth, she feels herself spiraling right back into Agatha’s gravitational pull. Her hands Agatha’s waist, finger slipping under her scrubs to brush the skin on her stomach. </span></p><p><span>She’s thinking about rushing her toward the wall behind her, her fingers sliding into her pants to test her wetness. </span></p><p><span>Instead, she forces herself to pull away before their public exhibition gets them both in trouble. </span></p><p><span>Rio rests her forehead against Agatha’s as they catch their breath. </span></p><p><span>“Go home, get some rest. I’ll finish this case,” she says as she watches Agatha lick her swollen lips. “We will start fresh tomorrow.” </span></p><p><span>She hopes Agatha catches that she means more than just this case. That she knows she’s willing to fight for her. Day by day. </span></p><p><span>Agatha nods as a small smile forms on her lips. “Yeah…yeah we can do that.” </span></p><p><span>Then she heads toward the parking lot. </span></p><p><span>—-</span></p><p><span>Rio stays too late that night - the residents have long since gone home. She should too, the resident notes needed to be signed hours ago. She just can’t seem to focus. Her brain loops every word with Agatha in the past few days. </span></p><p><span>It feels like she is standing on train tracks. She sees the oncoming light, hears the thunder of the wheels - Agatha’s impending marriage, her mother’s grip on her life - all barreling toward her. She wants to stick out her hands to stop it. But she knows that’s impossible. So she doesn’t move, she just braces for impact. </span></p><p><span>Rio’s pager buzzes and she grabs it, seeing the ER number. </span></p><p><span>She frowns and calls them back. “Dr. Vidal speaking. I’m not on admissions tonight.” </span></p><p><span>“Hold on,” the unit secretary says, ignoring her.</span></p><p><span>“Dr.Vidal!” The familiar voice of one of the long term ER attendings comes on the other line. “I’ve got a patient for you.”</span></p><p><span>“Yeah, I’m not doing the admissions tonight. Dr. Strange is.” She reaches to hang up the phone.</span></p><p><span>“Wait, wait. You are going to want to take this one.” He pauses. “She’s asking for you.”</span></p><p><span>“Okay…” Rio hesitates. She pulls out a pen and paper ready to take notes on the patient. “Go ahead, name?”</span></p><p><span>“She didn’t want me to go into detail, she just asked me to just have you come see her. Room 14.” And the line clicks dead. </span></p><p><span>Rio doesn’t know what kind of game the emergency room is playing, but she’s a bit annoyed. She logs back onto her computer, pulling up the patient board. </span></p><p><span>Room 14:</span><em><span> Confidential</span></em><span> </span></p><p><span>Two authorizations are required before the chart will open. Rio clicks through, attempting to pull up the name. </span></p><p><em><span>Jane Doe. </span></em></p><p><span>Chief complaint: </span><em><span>Multi-trauma </span></em></p><p><span>Her pulse spikes a bit, unease starting to prick at her. She isn’t a trauma surgeon. This shouldn’t be her case. The best she can come up with is it’s a former patient, asking to see her again. </span></p><p><span>Room 14 is in the corner of the ER, curtains drawn tight. It’s quiet in this corner, closed off from the usual chaos from the rest of the emergency room. </span></p><p><span>A nurse hurries toward her. “Oh, Dr. Vidal! “I’m glad you are here. She’s been asking for you.”</span></p><p><span>“It wasn’t clear on the phone what’s going on.”</span></p><p><span>“Poor thing. She has a lung contusion, splenic laceration and three broken ribs. She has a head laceration that needs sutures too.” She glances around to make sure no one hears her. “She says it’s a car accident but that doesn’t make sense. There was no seatbelt sign, no airbag burns. Honestly, just between us, it looks like someone took a baseball bat to her…”</span></p><p><span>“I’m sorry,” Rio shakes her head trying to piece it all together. “How old did you say she was?”</span></p><p><span>“Oh I didn’t,” the nurse flips the ER paper chart open. “Umm…25.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s heart drops. </span></p><p><span>“I was thinking she needs to be admitted at least overnight…” the nurse starts but Rio doesn’t hear another word. </span></p><p><span>She’s grabbing the door handle, pushing it open. </span></p><p><span>The first thing she sees is the tubing - clear lines snaking across pale skin. A hospital gown drowns the small frame in the bed. </span></p><p><span>A bloodstain streaks across one temple, an open laceration sits above her eyebrow. And her brown hair is tangled, splayed across the hospital pillow. </span></p><p><span>Rio takes a step closer, further into the room.</span></p><p><span>Her chest tightens as the face comes into focus.</span></p><p><span>Her world stops.</span></p><p><span>Agatha. </span></p>

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>is this canon? I might be taking a few creative liberties. We know Evanora basically hated Agatha (“I should have killed you the moment you left my body”) but I’m not sure it was always like that between the two of them. We see that Agatha was a part of her coven, so Evanora did invite her in - and that coven largely seemed like mothers and daughters based on what we know of the Salem Seven. So it does seem at some point Evanora was teaching her and despite her likely abusive nature, they did work/learn together in some capacity. Well, up until Agatha basically snapped and killed them all (but they came after her first!)</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p> </p><p><span>Rio steps quietly into the room, softening her movements so as to not wake her. Agatha’s eyes are closed where she rests in the bed. Purple bruising paints the side of her cheek and a small, angry laceration lies open above her eyebrow. Her left arm wraps protectively around her ribs, every breath shallow and cautious. </span></p><p><span>Rio reaches carefully, brushing her hand along her foot beneath the hospital blanket. </span></p><p><span>“Hi,” Agatha’s eyes meet hers, looking far too large and scared, red rimming the outside. Her cheeks shine faintly where tears have tracked and dried. Even the edges of her nostrils are red and angry. “You came.”</span></p><p><span>Rio swallows hard, steadier her voice before she speaks. “Didn’t have much of a choice. You left it quite a mystery.”</span></p><p><span>“Seemed best to maintain some autonomy.”</span></p><p><span>Rio rounds the bed, planting herself along the side. She lowers the bedrail. Her tone drops, fear and anger swirling together. “Agatha, what the hell happened?” </span></p><p><span>“Car accident,” she answers too quickly. </span></p><p><span>“Bullshit. What did she do?” </span></p><p><span>“Like I said,” Agatha breaks, like she’s on the verge of crying; her words coming out small. “Car accident.” </span></p><p><span>And Rio can’t help it anymore. Agatha might not be hers. She may never get to be hers again. But in this moment, Agatha needs her. </span></p><p><span>“Sweetheart…” The sentiment rushes out before she can stop it. But it still feels right. Her hand raises, hovering above Agatha’s bruised cheek. .</span></p><p><span>“Rio…” Agatha looks up at her, tears silently falling now. </span></p><p><span>Rio slips her shoes off, lifting the blanket to slip into the spot next to her. She moves slowly and carefully, curling herself around Agatha’s trembling frame. Her arms gingerly move around to Agatha’s shoulders, careful not to move her too suddenly. </span></p><p><span>“Someone could see you, you know,” Agatha murmurs even as her head finds Rio’s shoulder. </span></p><p><span>“I don’t care.” Rio’s tone turns more serious. “You have to get out of there.”</span></p><p><span>“And what? Where would I go? I have an intern salary.”</span></p><p><span>“Come stay with me.”</span></p><p><span>“Then what? She fires you. And me.”</span></p><p><span>“And we run away together. I hear Alaska needs doctors.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha starts to let out a small laugh, but stops short, wincing at the motion. “I wouldn’t be a doctor, Rio. I’d be a residency drop out.”</span></p><p><span>“I’ll be your sugar mama then. You can take up fly fishing.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha rests her head on Rio’s shoulder again, sighing. “That does sound nice.” </span></p><p><span>They stay like that for a while, unmoving. The only noises are the faint sounds of Agatha’s blood pressure cuff inflating every few minutes and the slow drip of her IV fluids through the tubing. It’s as peaceful as it can be - for the hospital. </span></p><p><span>At last, Rio tilts her head, murmuring into her hair. “I need to suture that head lac, you know.”</span></p><p><span>“Mmhmm,” Agatha murmurs with her eyes closed. “But you are so cozy.” </span></p><p><span>Rio places a small kiss on her temple. “I’m sorry, I need to get to it before the edges start healing.”</span></p><p><span>She begins to slide out of bed, easing her way out as best she can without disturbing Agatha. She winces anyway. </span></p><p><span>“Morphine?”</span></p><p><span>“Something. Please. It hurts to breathe.”</span></p><p><span>“I’ll be right back.” Rio squeezes her hand before stepping out to grab supplies and a nurse for the medication. </span></p><p><span>She closes the curtain and the door behind her.</span></p><p><span>In the supply room, she gathers sutures, forceps, a vial of lidocaine, gauze and a small bandage. She flags down the nurse and orders morphine for Agatha. </span></p><p><span>When she finally rounds the corner back to Agatha’s room, the door is cracked open, the curtains drawn wide. </span></p><p><span>And standing at the threshold is Evanora. </span></p><p><span>Even though it’s well into the evening, she’s still dressed like she’s stepping into the office wearing cream tailored pants with a black leather belt and a high turtleneck black sweater. She took the time to grab her hospital badge before leaving the house. </span></p><p><span>Rio’s first instinct is to tackle her. Luckily the sensible side of her kicks in before she does. </span></p><p><span>“Evanora,” Rio says, her voice flat and annoyed. </span></p><p><span>Evanora crosses her arms, her gaze slides from Agatha back to her. “So you’re her attending.” </span></p><p><span>Fuck, Rio’s throat dries. She flicks her eyes to Agatha, sticking her tongue in her cheek. She hopes Agatha realizes she’s silently asking how much Evanora knows. </span></p><p><span>Agatha shakes her head softly.  </span></p><p><span>Rio squares her shoulders and moves to stand between Evanora and the bed. A physical shield for Agatha. “I’m her attending, tonight.”</span></p><p><span>Evanora’s mouth twists, an almost evil grin across her lips. “You know that’s not what I meant.” She steps closer, lowering her voice like she’s a predator about to devour her prey. “It’s curious, though. The way you always seem to be hovering. The way she looks at you. I’ve seen it before - in other residents; other…attachments.” She lets the word linger, poisonous. </span></p><p><span>Her gaze slides deliberately back to Agatha. “Some people just can’t help themselves, parading around their sin like it’s salvation.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha flinches, the words stinging. </span></p><p><span>Rio doesn’t quite know what happens at that moment. She knows she stops thinking.  She drops the supplies onto the bedside table. Then her right hand curls into a fist, tucking in her thumb. And she swings. She’s pretty sure she hits the side of Evanora’s jaw judging by the sound.</span></p><p><span>The old woman grunts, something painful before she stumbles, falling sideways onto Agatha’s bed. </span></p><p><span>Agatha gasps.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s knuckles start burning, pain and swelling rising instantly. </span></p><p><span>One would expect such a small, frail woman to concede. But she rises up slowly, blood boiling. </span></p><p><span>“You. Will. Pay. For. This.” She spits as she rises, blood droplets spraying lightly with her words. “Agatha!” She snaps. “Get your things. We are leaving.”</span></p><p><span>Silence follows. Then, “No,” comes Agatha’s voice from the bed. More steady than Rio expected. </span></p><p><span>“Excuse me?” </span></p><p><span>“Get out, mother. I don’t need you here. I don’t need another injury.” </span></p><p><span>“I will call security to have you escorted out,” Rio adds. </span></p><p><span>“Are you threatening me? In my own hospital? What are you going to tell them? That you attacked the CEO visiting her sick daughter?” She wipes the bloody spit from her lips. </span></p><p><span>Out of the corner of her eye, Rio sees Agatha’s fingers slowly stretching across the bed, reaching for the nurse call button. She presses it discreetly. `</span></p><p><span>“At this moment, she is my patient. Not the CEO’s daughter.” </span></p><p><span>Evanora’s hand twitches, rising slowly, palm flat. Rio feels her body tighten, head already starting to turn, bracing for the slap she knows is coming.</span></p><p><span>But before it lands, the door slides open, the nurse’s head poking in. “Is everything alright in here?” She pauses, seeing Evanora’s face, ugly purple bruising now painting her jawline. “Oh my. Ma’am, are you ok? Do you need to see a doctor?” </span></p><p><span>“She’s fine.” Agatha answers for her. </span></p><p><span>Rio cuts in smoothly, gesturing toward the supplies. “I need your assistance to suture Miss Harkness's laceration. She is being admitted overnight.”</span></p><p><span>The nurse nods, stepping further into the room. “I’m afraid visiting hours are over then. Can I get you an ice pack before you go?” She offers Evanora a sweet, oblivious smile, as though she has no idea who she is dismissing. </span></p><p><span>Evanora’s lips press thin, fury sparking in her eyes. “I need </span><em><span>her</span></em><span> name.” </span></p><p><span>“Oh that’s Dr. Vidal,” the nurse answers, none the wiser. </span></p><p><span>“Perfect,” an evil smile curls on her lips before she turns on her heel, walking out the door without bothering to close it. </span></p><p><span>Agatha finally exhales, long and shaky. Her shoulders sag, some of the fight draining out with her breath. </span></p><p><span>“You know you can press charges,” Rio says, her tone shifting to something harder as she tears open a packet of gauze.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes flick toward the nurse now drawing lidocaine into a syringe. </span></p><p><span>“For a car accident?” Agatha asks through gritted teeth. </span></p><p><span>“Even for a </span><em><span>car accident</span></em><span>.”</span></p><p><span>“It’s not worth the effort.” </span></p><p><span>“Agatha,” Rio’s voice lands like a warning. </span></p><p><span>“Drop it,” Agatha whispers, her tone fragile and final all at once. “Now you better sew this up right, even with a bad hand. I can’t have this beautiful face scarred up.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smiles before starting to work. Silence fills the room apart from the sound of packages ripping, bandages opening. Agatha only winces once, as Rio injects the numbing agent into her skin. Otherwise she taps away at her phone. Rio catches a glimpse of her message - Agatha telling Billy she won’t be in tomorrow, blaming her so-called car accident. </span></p><p><span>Once the sutures are done, Rio strides over to the mobile computer, drawing up Agatha’s discharge paperwork. She unhooks Agatha’s monitors, the bleeping slowly dying away. </span></p><p><span>Then she reaches for Agatha’s clothes, ready to help her dress, but Agatha freezes, eyebrows lifted.  </span></p><p><span>“I thought you said I’m staying overnight?”</span></p><p><span>“You are,” Rio smiles, “at my place.” </span></p><p><span>“Rio, we can’t do that.”</span></p><p><span>“Yes we can. She can’t open your chart. It’s a HIPAA violation. And even she isn’t stupid enough to pull that.” </span></p><p><span>“She’s going to fire you,” Agatha warns. </span></p><p><span>“Then I’ll move to Alaska. It was worth it.” </span></p><p><span>Rio grabs a wheelchair from the hallway, crouching to lock the brakes. Then she reaches around to untie Agatha’s gown, carefully, lifting her arms to slip her into a shirt and squats next to the bed to shimmy her pants up her legs. When she offers Agatha her hand, she stands slowly hissing as Rio steadies her, lowering her into the seat. </span></p><p><span>Rio pushes her through the sliding glass doors and out into the dim parking lot, mostly empty at this hour. Once Rio has her settled in the passenger seat, she rounds to the driver’s side. </span></p><p><span>As they start to drive away, out of the hospital parking lot, the glow of Agatha’s phone lights up on her lap. Agatha flips it over in one sharp motion, silencing the buzz. </span></p><p><span>—</span></p><p><span>“Hungry?” Rio asks, once she settles Agatha onto her couch. She’s changed into a borrowed oversized t-shirt and boxers. A fuzzy blanket cocooned around her shoulders. </span></p><p><span>“I can try,” Agatha says dryly. </span></p><p><span>Rio brushes a hand over the top of her head, quick, almost shy in the way she does it. She wants to sink down into the cushions next to her, cradle her close, like she did in the hospital. This feels more intimate somehow, Agatha in her space, Rio offering to nurse her back to health. </span></p><p><span>She hesitates next to her before stepping into the kitchen to pull pots and pans from the cabinet. A bag of rice and a carton of chicken follow. Then she grabs an ice pack, placing it over her sore knuckles as she cooks.</span></p><p><span>From the couch, Agatha watches her in silence for a few minutes. She works methodically, trimming and seasoning the chicken before placing it in a pan. She sets the rice to boil. </span></p><p><span>“You know how to cook?” Agatha finally asks. </span></p><p><span>“It’s nothing fancy. Just seasoned chicken and rice. Figured you might want something mild tonight. Plus,” Rio holds up her right hand, slightly swollen and bruised. </span></p><p><span>Agatha lets out a small huff that could be amusement or disbelief. “I’m usually one for take-out.” </span></p><p><span>“Not the chef type?”</span></p><p><span>“Hey now, I can boil an egg.”</span></p><p><span>“I’ll remember that tomorrow morning,” Rio tosses out casually before she feels the blush rising in her cheeks at her words. </span></p><p><span>Agatha smiles, tucking the blanket tighter around herself. </span></p><p><span>Rio plates two portions, carrying the plates next to Agatha on the couch. She hands her one, followed by a glass of water and pain medication. </span></p><p><span>Agatha accepts them silently, but then as they start eating, Agatha’s phone lights up again. She shoves it quickly beneath the blanket, silencing it with her thumb.</span></p><p><span>Rio wants to give her the space to heal - physically and emotionally. But she still worries about what hooks Evanora has in her. Hell, she doesn’t even know what Agatha said that led Evanora to this level of crazy. </span></p><p><span>“Do you want to tell me who keeps calling?” Rio asks. “It isn’t her…is it?” </span></p><p><span>“It’s nothing,” Agatha deflects, too quickly. “TV?” She pivots, reaching for the remote on the coffee table. </span></p><p><span>“Sure,” Rio drags her hesitation through the word. Still something scratches at her and won’t let go. She forces herself not to pry, not yet anyway. As much as Agatha shut her down at the resident retreat, clearly something changed tonight. Something she wants to be privy of. </span></p><p><span>Agatha flips through the channels mindlessly, running the gamut of channels twice. Then she abandons them for streaming menus, clicking without focus. Her eyes are glassy, detached.</span></p><p><span>Her phone buzzes again, more insistent. This time, when she silences it, she peers at Rio, seeing her watching the motion out of the corner of her eye. </span></p><p><span>“It’s Ralph,” she finally admits. “My mother must have called him. She’s convinced if I spend enough time with him, it will ‘turn me.’” She punctuates it with a bitter pair of air quotes. </span></p><p><span>And now that she has her alone, now that she knows the truth, Rio can’t help but ask more. “Do you talk to him a lot?”</span></p><p><span>“I used to complain to him about my mom. When I had no one else.”</span></p><p><span>“And now?”</span></p><p><span>“I’d like to think I have you.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smiles, reaching her arm out to thread it around her shoulders, drawing her closer. “You do.” </span></p><p><span>A beat passes before she probes again. “Do you wanna talk about what happened?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha keeps her eyes on the muted TV, despite settling into Rio’s side. “Not particularly.”</span></p><p><span>“I lost a patient to abuse once.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s head jerks toward her, startled. Her shoulders tighten beneath Rio’s arm. “I’m not abused.”</span></p><p><span>“I didn’t say that you were,” Rio answers softly. “I’m telling you a story.” She takes a deep breath, her mind going back to that night. “It was an infant. A few weeks old at best. The father shook him for crying too much. How does someone injure their own child? Their own flesh and blood.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha is quiet for a long time, her jaw working silently. “I think you will find that being their own flesh makes them hate them even more. When you don’t turn out the way you expected. When they’re not the person you wanted them to be.”</span></p><p><span>“That doesn’t make it your fault.” Rio’s chest aches at the bitterness in Agatha’s voice. </span></p><p><span>Agatha straightens a little, lifting her chin in defiance. “I’m strong, okay? I’ve survived this for years.”</span></p><p><span>“I know you’re strong. Clearly,” Rio squeezes her shoulder. “You got through medical school. You’re one of the best residents in the program. Not because of your mother, but in spite of her. You’re a good doctor Agatha. You’re a better person.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha offers a small smile. “I didn’t mention you, you know. If that’s what you were worried about.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m not. And it doesn’t matter if you did.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shifts, her voice dropping to something fragile. “I told her I don’t wanna marry him.” She keeps her gaze forward. </span></p><p><span>Rio holds her breath. “What was her response?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha points to her sutured eyebrow, dried blood is caked along the bandage, bruising peeking through the edges. “Lesbians don’t become CEO’s, Agatha,” she uses a mocking tone. </span></p><p><span>“Beth Ford, Leanne Pittsford.”</span></p><p><span>“Who?”</span></p><p><span>“Marsha Johnson, Stormé DeLarverie?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha gives her a blank look. </span></p><p><span>Rio sighs, “Jesus, sometimes I forget you are 25. How about Renee Rapp, Chappell Roan, Lucy Dacus?”</span></p><p><span>“Better.” Agatha smirks. </span></p><p><span>Rio shakes her head. “But for what it’s worth,” she leans into her again, her lips brushing her temple. “I’m proud of you for finding your voice.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha snuggles closer, her reply so quiet, Rio barely hears it, “I am too.”</span></p><p><span>It takes only a few minutes before they are both yawning, the weight of the day starting to press down on them, creeping into their bones.</span></p><p><span>Rio guides her gently toward the bedroom, handing over the extra toothbrush she’s kept since Agatha’s last visit. When they return, she piles pillows high against the headboard. “You’ll be more comfortable like this, if you can sleep sitting up a little bit.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha starts to huff a protest, but her body betrays her. She sinks into the cushiony pile as soon as she climbs into the bed, finally relaxing.</span></p><p><span>—</span></p><p><span>“Are you asleep?” Agatha’s voice drifts softly through the dark, breaking the hush of the room. </span></p><p><span>“I was,” Rio groans, rolling toward her. “What’s wrong? Are you in pain?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha nods, Rio can feel the movement between them. </span></p><p><span>Rio grabs her phone from the nightstand, squinting at the time, it’s well after 2am. “You’re not due for more pain medication for another hour and a half. I can get a heating pad.” </span></p><p><span>“It’s not that kind of pain,” her tone edged with suggestion. </span></p><p><span>“Oh no, we are not doing that. You are injured. You need to spend time and energy getting better.”</span></p><p><span>“Please,” Agatha pleads. “Just one tiny orgasm. I’ll even stay sitting up. Look,” she gestures to her legs, half-propped up on the bed. “I’m in the perfect position.”</span></p><p><span>And damn, how can Rio refuse her? Even in the middle of the night, her hair thrown up in a sloppy bun that she tied with one hand, no makeup on. She looks gorgeous.</span></p><p><span>“Fine,” Rio gives in. “One orgasm. But I’m going to be extra gentle.”</span></p><p><span>“Just give me your mouth already,” She laughs, grabbing Rio’s wrist, tugging her closer. </span></p><p><span>Rio melts into her with a kiss against Agatha’s lips before trailing lower. She slides the borrowed boxers down her thighs and nestles between her legs, breathing her in. </span></p><p><span>Agatha parts her legs slowly, invitingly, as Rio strokes her folds, opening her with steady fingers. Then her tongue finds her - slow and savoring the taste of her arousal. Her tongue works through her, circling, deliberate and unhurried circles around her clit.  </span></p><p><span>Agatha’s hips buck up involuntarily, a ragged breath escaping her throat. Her head falls against the propped up pillows, her eyes squeeze shut as Rio licks along her, pressing her tongue into her entrance. </span></p><p><span>Her tongue continues swirling, licking, circling before she flattens her tongue along her clit, adding pressure. She sucks hard at her clit, pulling just a little as she does because she knows that spot, the motion that drives her wild. </span></p><p><span>Another wave of arousal seeps out of her and Rio savors every drop. She knows her body’s secrets now, like a language. She knows the location that will send her flying, that drives her mad, the kind of teasing she looks, her look when she’s about to come. </span></p><p><span>“Fuck,” Agatha grinds into her, her hips circling against Rio’s chin. </span></p><p><span>She’s rewarded again with a deep moan as Agatha threads her fingers through Rio’s hair. But she isn’t holding her there, she’s not pressing her into her cunt harder. Instead she’s brushing the strands away from her face, moving them in a way that seems reverent, delicate. </span></p><p><span>And then it doesn’t feel like fucking. </span></p><p><span>Not this time.</span></p><p><span>It’s gentle strokes and thigh caresses. It’s Agatha’s hand, now reaching down between her legs, linking her fingers through Rio’s hand to hold her close. </span></p><p><span>It feels dangerously close to making love. </span></p><p><span>“Rio,” she breathes, her voice breaking with her name. </span></p><p><span>Rio looks up at her from between her thighs expecting to find Agatha with her head back, eyes squeezed shut. But instead she’s looking down at her. Eyes open, glassy and defenseless in a way she never allows herself to be. She’s watching her, tilting her head, her lips slightly open, chest heaving. </span></p><p><span>Something blooms in Rio’s chest, threatening to overwhelm her with the intensity of it. When she can’t take it anymore, she dives down, tilting her head, breaking eye contact. </span></p><p><span>She focuses her attention on her movements, driving Agatha closer to the edge, pressing her tongue deeper, licking, sucking, coaxing the wetness from her. </span><span>        </span></p><p><span>Agatha’s breaths start to become more shallow and uneven and Rio knows she’s close. She can feel her drip down her chin, throbbing against her tongue. She focuses on her clit, pressing into it, sucking hard until Agatha starts to grow more frenzied, the edges of control fraying. Her hand breaks free of Rio’s fingers to thread under her shirt, pinching and pulling at her nipple. </span></p><p><span>Her release takes her suddenly, like a wave rushing into the shore. Her thighs tighten around Rio’s head, toes curling as her hips rise. She exhales, a rough string of </span><em><span>yes, yes </span></em><span>across her lips. Rio’s mouth works her through it, unrelenting, letting out a low, satisfied hum as she cleans her up. </span></p><p><span>Finally as Agatha’s body sags and collapses back into the pillows, Rio turns, wiping her chin with her forearm. She plants a kiss along her inner thigh before settling into the spot next to her in bed. </span></p><p><span>Her chest aches with the unspokeness of what just happened; the unexpected tenderness of the moment, the way the lust blurred into something softer. </span></p><p><span>When Agatha rises and pushes herself up slowly, Rio is already moving, sliding off the bed to steady her with an outstretched hand. She leans in, kissing her slowly, the taste of her still heavy on her tongue. </span></p><p><span>“Bathroom,” Agatha gestures, stepping toward the door. </span></p><p><span>Rio nods, watching her retreat. She sinks back onto the mattress, reaching for a glass of water on her nightstand. </span></p><p><span>One thought crowds her throat, loud and echoing in her brain. Desperate and dangerous.  </span><span>She fears it will slip free when Agatha returns. She swallows the rest of her water, hoping to swallow the words along with it.</span></p><p><span>The door creaks as Agatha makes her way back into the bed, slipping in next to Rio. She turns to curl along Rio’s side, her head resting on her chest. </span></p><p><span>“I feel better,” she murmurs. </span></p><p><span>“Good.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes are already fluttering closed, her limbs growing heavy against Rio’s chest. Within minutes, her breathing evens out, soft and steady. </span></p><p><span>Rio lies there for a long time in the dark, staring at the ceiling. And still, she aches to say more, the words bubbling up within her. She can feel herself slipping deeper into Agatha’s pull, an undertow she no longer wants to escape from. </span></p><p><span>“I think I love you,” she whispers into the dark. </span></p><p><span>She’s met with only silence. </span></p><p><span>—</span></p><p><span>The morning light streams through Rio’s blinds, hitting her eyes. </span></p><p><span>Agatha is still asleep next to her, curled softly to her side, one hand resting protectively over her injured ribs.</span></p><p><span>Rio climbs out of bed slowly, not wanting to disturb her. She’s already decided she will stay home with her today - making sure Agatha stays fed and well-medicated. Maybe she’ll even take the rest of the week off.</span></p><p><span>She grabs her laptop from the nightstand and pads into the kitchen. As turns on the coffee pot before settling at the table to pull up her call schedule. She skims down the list of names, looking to see who is on call to cover her shifts. </span></p><p><span>But before she can land on one, her phone buzzes against the wood, making her jump. The number is unfamiliar, though the area code looks oddly like the hospital. </span></p><p><span>“Dr. Vidal.” She answers. </span></p><p><span>On the other end, a voice clears her throat. </span></p><p><span>“Dr. Vidal, this is Sharon Davis,” she sounds clipped, almost rehearsed. </span></p><p><span>“Yes?” Rio hesitates. She can feel the air shift on the other line, tension building. Sharon inhales sharply.</span></p><p><span>“I regret to inform you that effective immediately, you are suspended without pay.” </span></p><p><span>“Excuse me,” Rio tries not to raise her voice. “What </span><em><span>exactly</span></em><span> am I being suspended for?” </span></p><p><span>“Umm,” She pauses as she hears Sharon clicking in the background. “The email says </span><em><span>due to professional misconduct</span></em><span>. And it appears to have come from the top, the c-suite.”</span></p><p><span>Of fucking-course it did. </span></p><p><span>“Sharon, you know this is completely baseless. There has never been so much as a patient complaint against me!” </span></p><p><span>“I know,” Sharon drops her voice low, careful no one can hear her. “If it was me, I’d be obtaining a lawyer. The whole thing smells a bit </span><em><span>fishy.</span></em><span>” Then her tone changes back to a formal cadence. “I will be sending through an email for you to sign as well. Stating you understand the suspension and you will not contact any residents for the foreseeable future.”</span></p><p><span>Rio can feel the color drain from her face. Followed by her blood starting to boil. She knew it might happen but hearing it firsthand feels even worse - Evanora went after her job, her livelihood. And she clearly thinks this will keep her away from Agatha…if only she knew. </span></p><p><span>The line clicks dead. </span></p><p><span>“God dammit!” She slams the phone onto the table, the crack of glass sharp against the wood. </span></p><p><span>“Rio,” comes Agatha’s sleepy voice as she treads into the kitchen. “Is everything ok?”</span></p><p><span>—</span></p>

<p><span>Previously on “can’t be a good girl:”</span></p><p><span>God dammit!” She slams the phone onto the table, the crack of glass sharp against the wood. </span></p><p><span>“Rio,” comes Agatha’s sleepy voice as she treads into the kitchen. “Is everything ok?”</span></p><p><span>—</span></p><p><span>“Everything is fine,” Rio says too quickly, scooping up her phone and tilting it under the light. A thin fracture blooms across the screen. “Just trying to find someone to cover my shifts for the rest of the week.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha frowns. “You don’t have to do that. I can take care of myself.“</span></p><p><span>“Nonsense,” Rio pushes to her feet, walking toward Agatha, arms open. She steps into her embrace. “Someone has to make sure you are well fed and pain free.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s cheek brushes her shoulder and Rio can feel her smile there. “Or I could just DoorDash food while you are at work. With your card, of course.”</span></p><p><span>Rio leans back, giving her a look. “Uh huh, you promised me eggs this morning.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha pulls away, laughing quietly as she pulls the eggs from the refrigerator. </span></p><p><span>While Rio watches her, guilt starts to gnaw at her.</span></p><p><span>But even with the lying, she isn’t ready to go to that place yet. What they’ve created in the last day feels so fragile, so new. She doesn’t want to launch into telling Agatha she is jobless now. And planning to fight the administration on it. She can see it now - Agatha will blame herself, their relationship - and shut her out. She might even go back to her mother. </span></p><p><span>She wants to hold onto the happy bubble they have, for now. Even if it’s threatening to pop. </span></p><p><span>Agatha opens the fridge, fetching two eggs and then finds a small pot, filling it with water to boil. Meanwhile, Rio busies herself with making coffee and a few pieces of toast. The domesticity of it all feels good, comfortable, even with the underlying threat biting at Rio. </span></p><p><span>By the time they sit shoulder to shoulder at the kitchen bar, plates and mugs between them, the fragile peace feels almost real. Almost.</span></p><p><span>Then the lying starts again.</span></p><p><span>“I need to run a few errands today. Just small things - some groceries for dinner, run by the hospital and grab some paperwork…” Rio takes a bite of her toast, now smeared with egg yolk. </span></p><p><span>“I can go with you.” Agatha offers. </span></p><p><span>“No way,” Rio counters. “You still need to heal. Stay here, shower, rest. I won’t be that long.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha gives her a sideways glance but doesn’t press further.</span></p><p><span>An hour later, she sits across from an old childhood friend, and thankfully a medical malpractice lawyer. Lilia has known her family since she was a child, mostly mingling with Rio’s mother, but she was always a strong supporter of Rio going to medical school. She made it to every graduation, white coat ceremony, all of it. </span></p><p><span>“Thank you for meeting with me.” Rio grips her coffee as if it might steady her hands. </span></p><p><span>“Anything for you, dear,” Lilia offers a small smile. “But you’ll have to explain this one to me. You’ve always been one of the hospital’s golden physicians. Why on earth are we here?” </span></p><p><span>Rio lets out a long exhale, before lifting her eyes to meet hers. “I’ve been suspended without pay for professional misconduct.”</span></p><p><span>Shock flickers across Lilia’s face before she reins it in. “On what basis?”</span></p><p><span>“They didn’t say.” </span></p><p><span>Lilia purses her lips, and Rio knows instantly she doesn’t believe her. “Nothing at all?”</span></p><p><span>Rio shakes her head. </span></p><p><span>“Ok,” Lilia hesitates, then reaches into her bag to retrieve a notepad and pen. “I’ll request official records from the Medical Executive Committee so we can prepare.” She writes</span><em><span> MEC records </span></em><span>across the page. “Once we have more formal reasoning, we will know which direction to go, but basically we want to prove you are a safe, reliable physician. And indispensable.” </span></p><p><span>“Sounds good,” Rio swallows her coffee hard, the liquid still too hot and burning her throat. Because she knows what’s coming, what Lilia will say next. </span></p><p><span>“Now is there anything you need to tell me. Anything at all?” Her pen sits poised to scribble down notes. </span></p><p><em><span>Just that I’m sleeping with my intern. </span></em></p><p><span>“Nope,” she lies.</span></p><p><span>“Rio,” Lilia tilts her head at her, like she knows, she’s just waiting for Rio to reveal it. “The MEC isn’t a court. They don’t go after your license unless it’s a suspension over 14 days - then it gets submitted to the medical board. They just need enough concern to justify keeping you out for that long.” </span></p><p><em><span>And that I punched her homophobic mother because of it. You know the CEO? That one. </span></em></p><p><span>“There...was a disagreement,” Rio admits, careful. “One of my interns was a patient, and her mother and I clashed over her care. Things escalated.” </span></p><p><span>Lilia lowers her pen. “Escalated how?”</span></p><p><span>“I wasn’t exactly professional.”</span></p><p><span>“And?” Lilia knows there is more coming.</span></p><p><span>“I punched her.” </span></p><p><span>“Ok,” Lilia sighs. </span></p><p><span>“She’s the hospital CEO.”</span></p><p><span>“Fuck,” Lilia pinches the bridge of her nose. “Evanora?” Rio nods. “She’s going to make this sound bad. Really bad. The MEC isn’t neutral. Most of them know her. Some may owe her favors. You need to expect bias walking in.” </span></p><p><span>Rio nods again, jaw tight. </span></p><p><span>Lilia leans forward, tone intense. “This is why I need honesty from you. This committee can extend your suspension, revoke it or worse - they can remove your hospital privileges. It’s not a judge and a jury, just a handful of physicians and hospital lawyers.” </span></p><p><span>“I’m aware.” Rio clips. </span></p><p><span>“So then why are you so willing to jeopardize your job for this intern? Losing your temper on the CEO of the hospital? You had to know what that could cost you.” </span></p><p><span>“I did.”</span></p><p><span>“And yet, you did it anyway.”</span><span> </span></p><p><span>“Yes.”</span></p><p><span>“Rio,” she sighs again, fatigue of the conversation starting to set in. “Are you sure there isn’t something you aren’t telling me? Anything going on with this intern?”</span></p><p><em><span>Just that I think I’m in love with her.</span></em></p><p><span>“Nothing at all.” </span></p><p><span>And the lies keep piling up. </span></p><p><span>By the time Rio makes it back home, grocery bags in full in her hands, it’s well past four. She pushes open the door and freezes for a moment. </span></p><p><span>Agatha is at the kitchen table, surrounded by medical journals, a highlighter between her fingers. But the air feels all wrong. Tight and tense. Agatha doesn’t stand to greet her, she doesn’t even shift. Her gaze only flicks up long enough to clock Rio moving toward the kitchen before dropping right back to her page.</span></p><p><span>“How were the errands? You were gone practically all day.” The tone feels casual, but Rio can feel her underlying sarcasm. She doesn’t lift her head as she speaks. </span></p><p><span>“Good,” Rio hesitates. “I got some stuff to make chili tonight.” She sets the bags down at the kitchen island, moving to unpack them one by one.</span></p><p><span>“And the hospital?” Agatha’s voice has an edge now, a quiet sharpness that makes Rio’s shoulders tighten. “How was that?”</span></p><p><span>“Fine,” Rio tries to keep her voice light. </span></p><p><span>“Did you run into any of the residents? Let them know I’m ok?” The question feels loaded, but Rio answers anyway, trying to skirt around the tension. </span></p><p><span>“I ran into Billy. He sends his well wishes.” Rio continues unpacking without looking up.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s highlighter pauses mid-stroke. “Really.”</span></p><p><span>Rio freezes. Her hand still hovers in the air where she was about to set down a can of beans. “Yes,” she says but the hesitation cracks through. </span></p><p><span>“Funny,” Agatha murmurs, finally lifting her eyes to meet Rio’s. But there is no softness there, only steady, unblinking tense energy. “Billy didn’t mention that when I texted him.” </span></p><p><span>Rio swallows. “Maybe that was before I was there.”</span></p><p><span>“Maybe.” Agatha drops her highlighter to lean back, crossing her arms. “And how about the part where you were suspended? Did you forget to mention that too?” </span></p><p><em><span>Fuck. </span></em></p><p><span>Rio sets down another can, turning toward Agatha, “How did you find out?” </span></p><p><span>“Well,” Agatha says sarcastically before sticking her tongue in her cheek. “When their attending mysteriously didn’t show up today, the other interns started asking questions. Didn’t take long for the news to reach me.” </span></p><p><span>Rio’s throat goes dry. When she planned on lying to Agatha, she thought it was for her own good. Keep her out of things, keep her from feeling guilty. Keep her…here. But now as Agatha slams the highlighter down and pushes back from the table, fury clear across her face - she realizes that pissed Agatha is way more dangerous than she ever expected. </span></p><p><span>“You lied to me,” she spits, starting to stalk toward the kitchen. “You stood right here all morning and fed me bullshit like I wouldn’t find out.” </span></p><p><span>“Agatha…” Rio turns to her. </span></p><p><span>“Don’t,” Her voice continues to rise, no restraint left. “Do you have any idea how humiliating this is? Everyone at the hospital knew before I did. Before your…” Her words cut off, jagged and unfinished. </span></p><p><span>Rio’s pulse spikes. “Before my </span><em><span>what</span></em><span>?”</span></p><p><span>“When were you going to tell me?” Agatha snaps.</span></p><p><span>“No, go back,” Rio steps in fast, catching her wrists with both hands. “What were you going to say?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes flash. “You think you can avoid punishment because I slipped over my words? Nice try.” She tears her wrists free and closes the distance, pressing forward until Rio’s lower back hits the counter. </span></p><p><span>Her palms slam down on either side of the surface, caging Rio in. </span></p><p><span>Rio shoves her then - not enough to injure, she’s still cautious of her healing wounds, but just enough that she stumbles backward, hitting her back on the stove. </span></p><p><span>“Scared?” Rio taunts, her breath coming faster. </span></p><p><span>“Of you?” Agatha scoffs. “No.”</span></p><p><span>Rio pushes off the counter hard, prowling closer until her mouth brushes the shell of Agatha’s ear. “You’re scared of your feelings for me. Just admit it.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha turns her head sharply, refusing to let Rio’s lips contact her skin. “You wish. Stop trying to change the subject. You lied to me. You only want me on your terms, when it’s convenient for you.” </span></p><p><span>“I want you on all terms,” Rio growls, surging forward again, so close their mouths almost touch. “That’s the problem.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s hand slides back along the counter, groping blindly until her fingers close around cold metal. She jerks it up between them, the blade flashing dully in the light. </span></p><p><span>Rio glances down, but back up at her with a toothy smile. “That’s a butter knife, honey.” </span></p><p><span>Still Agatha drags the blade upward slowly, not cutting, just tracing over Rio’s chest, up her throat, until the metal rests just below her jaw. Rio exhales hard, eyes flickering shut for a second before snapping open again, now dark and hooded with desire. </span></p><p><span>Rio’s hand shoots up, seizing Agatha’s wrist, trying to force the knife away. But Agatha’s other hand snaps up too, gripping the blade itself. Rio wrenches at it, causing Agatha to gasp as the tiny teeth bite into her skin. </span></p><p><span>They stay like that, a physical tug of war, until Rio yanks the knife free, the blade pushing against Agatha’s skin again. A thin slice has formed along Agatha’s palm, not large, like a papercut - the blood beading in tiny droplets. </span></p><p><span>“Kinda tickles doesn’t it?” Rio chuckles before her tongue darts out, licking the blood from Agatha’s hand. </span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes widen as she does. “You’re sick,” she murmurs. </span></p><p><span>Then Agatha kisses her - hard, biting at her bottom lip. The butter knife clatters from Rio’s hand to the counter as Agatha’s free hand clamps around Rio’s jaw, holding her in place. Agatha can taste the blood still on her tongue. </span></p><p><span>Rio gasps into her mouth, the edge of the counter digging into her back. Agatha grinds forward, deliberately rough, every roll of her body a punishment. She fists her hands in Rio’s shirt, keeping her in place, forcing her to feel the heat of the anger pressed against her.  </span></p><p><span>“You think you can keep me in the dark and still get me when you want me?” Agatha drags her teeth down Rio’s throat, sucking hard to leave a mark. </span></p><p><span>Her thigh wedges between Rio’s legs, pressing up into her cunt until Rio can’t hold back the moan escaping from her throat. Agatha smirks at the noise as her fingers rush to undo the button on Rio’s pants, unzipping them just enough to slide her hand inside.</span></p><p><span>Rio jerks when Agatha’s hand pushes past the fabric, fingers pushing through her folds punishingly.  </span></p><p><span>“Fuck,” Rio moans as Agatha shoves two fingers inside her cunt without pretense of gentleness. Her fingers clutch at the counter behind her. Agatha fucks her hard and fast, thrusting deep into her. </span></p><p><span>“Tell me why you lied to me,” she completely withdraws her fingers, leaving her feeling empty. </span></p><p><span>“This is manipulation you know,” Rio glares at her but her hips betray her, lifting, desperate, trying to usher Agatha’s fingers back inside. </span></p><p><span>“Come on,” Agatha purrs, dragging her fingers over her clit, cruel in her light touch. “You love it. The anticipation.” </span></p><p><span>She pushes inside again, curling her fingers perfectly, hitting the spongy part that threatens to unravel her. “Why. Did. You. Lie.” Agatha punctuates every word with the thrusts of her fingers. </span></p><p><span>“God…” Rio moans, her head falling forward toward Agatha’s, resting on her temple. </span></p><p><span>“Not good enough,” Agatha rips her fingers away again, flattening her hand against her pussy. Rio instantly grinds against it, shameless, trying to increase the friction. </span></p><p><span>Rio shakes her head, teeth gritted, chasing her high. “I wasn’t…”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s fingers glide back over her clit, once more as Rio’s gasps, but then Agatha pulls away. “Try again.” </span></p><p><span>Rio’s legs shake, her thighs squeezing together to trap Agatha’s hand. </span></p><p><span>“Say it,” Agatha growls, her mouth at Rio’s ear now, breath hot on her skin. “Say why and maybe I’ll let you come.” </span></p><p><span>Rio’s voice breaks as the words finally spill. “I lied because -” </span></p><p><span>Agatha drives her fingers back inside, hard. </span></p><p><span>“I thought -” Another thrust. </span></p><p><span>“If you knew -” A third finger gets added, stretching her. She curls her fingers forward. </span></p><p><span>“If you knew I got suspended for you, you’d run.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha inhales sharply, her eyes widening at Rio’s confession. “You thought I’d leave.” </span></p><p><span>“Yes,” Rio pants, her whole body tightening against Agatha’s hand. “I thought you’d hate me for it. Or worse - you’d disappear.” </span></p><p><span>Anger, shock, with a hint of something soft, flickers in Agatha’s gaze. “Fuck,” Agatha sighs, then her palm presses hard against Rio’s cunt as she pounds into her, her own hips grinding forward in rhythm, forcing her higher. </span></p><p><span>Her thumb presses into Rio’s clit, drawing tight circles. “Say it again,” Agatha demands. “Say you lied.”</span></p><p><span>“No.” Rio’s voice drops lower now, steadier, threading through the air between them. “Tell me what you were going to say.” </span></p><p><span>“You think you have the upper hand here?” Agatha taunts, “it’s my fingers inside you.” </span></p><p><span>“I…” Rio cries, clutching at the counter until her knuckles turn white. “I don’t care.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s jaw works, like she’s deciding if she wants to cave to Rio’s demands. Her hand stays inside Rio, holding her open, thumb circling in slow, maddening spirals. When she leans in, teeth grazing the shell of Rio’s ear, her voice is ragged, like she’s furious at herself for what’s about to come out. </span></p><p><span>“I’m not going to run, ok?” She growls, each word bitten off with anger and confession. “I’m yours ok? Your girlfriend.” </span></p><p><span>The admission hits hard, pushing Rio into her orgasm. Her whole body seizes around Agatha’s fingers at her words. </span></p><p><span>“Fuck, Agatha.” Rio cries out, her legs stiffening and her hips jerking as her release rips through her. The orgasm hits hard and hot, wracking her body as she clutches at Agatha’s biceps like a lifeline. </span></p><p><span>Agatha doesn’t pull away. Her forehead drops to Rio’s, breath mingling. Her hand stays inside her, thumb tracing her swollen clit as she comes down from her orgasm. Rio winces, flinching, and Agatha starts moving away before she gets too overstimulated. She withdraws her fingers from Rio’s pants, placing them on the counter behind Rio until they are almost locked together, bodies pressing into each other. </span></p><p><span>“Just don’t…don’t lie to me again.” Agatha’s voice is quieter now, edged with softness and pain. </span></p><p><span>Rio exhales shakily, still trembling. Her lips part, a smile tugging at her mouth. “I don’t think I could lie to you again, even if I wanted to,” she admits, her voice rough with desire. </span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes darken again, a flicker of arousal across them. “Good. Because I’d make you regret it.” Her fingers dig into Rio’s hip bones, pressing her pelvis into her possessively. </span></p><p><span>Rio looks between them at the contact of their hips. “Or maybe I’d like it,” she teases, tilting her pelvis forward into Agatha’s. </span></p><p><span>Agatha groans - full of frustration and want. “Don’t test me,” she bites, her hips grinding once. </span></p><p><span>Rio leans in, daring, whispering to her. “Maybe I want to see how far you’ll go.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha growls before seizing her lips into a greedy kiss. She presses further into Rio, the heat simmering between them. </span></p><p><span>For a second, they just breathe together, pressed against the counter, foreheads resting on each other, hands lingering on hips and arms, chest to chest, letting the intensity settle. </span></p><p><span>“Can I explain?” Rio swallows hard, raising her head up to meet Agatha’s eyes, still full of emotion and lingering arousal.  </span></p><p><span>She nods, slowly. Her fingers run up and down Rio’s arm, a soft lingering touch. </span></p><p><span>“Do you want to sit down?” Rio twists out of her grasp, motioning toward the table. </span></p><p><span>Agatha sighs, following behind her. When she stops to open the fridge, Rio assumes to grab a bottle of water. But she stands there, with the door open, her head poking inside for too long. It’s then, Rio realizes she isn’t just grabbing a drink, she’s giving herself a moment, a space to recover from everything that was just said and done between them. </span></p><p><span>Rio steps closer, her hand lightly on Agatha’s lower back, reassuring her of her presence without words. Agatha exhales, leaning back into her. </span></p><p><span>“Come on, come sit down,” Rio’s voice is low and careful. </span></p><p><span>Agatha closes the fridge door, a bottle of water clutched in her hand, before she sinks into the chair across the Rio. Her fingers instantly start picking at the label, shredding it into curls.</span></p><p><span>“Your mom suspended me. From the hospital. Without pay,” Rio starts slowly, letting Agatha absorb her words. </span></p><p><span>“Ok…” The label peels off in one large strip. </span></p><p><span>“I’ve been fighting back. I got a lawyer, a pretty good one. And we are meeting with the disciplinary board in a few days to try to get my job back.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh my god,” Agatha says quietly, but Rio can see her wheels spinning.</span></p><p><span>A long silence stretches, broken only by the crinkle of the torn label between Agatha’s fingers. Finally, she drops the crumbled paper onto the table, lifting her gaze. “What do I need to do?” </span></p><p><span>Rio furrows her brow. “Nothing. This isn’t your fight.”</span></p><p><span>“Like hell it isn’t,” Agatha shoves back her chair, standing abruptly. She starts pacing around the small room, cutting lines into the kitchen. She mutters words under her breath about her mother, fairness, how wrong this is. Finally she whirls, turning to Rio with a fire blazing in her eyes. “I can help you here. I have ideas. Let me help you.” </span></p><p><span>Rio shakes her head, sighing. She doesn’t want Agatha going up against her mother, not now, not with everything that already happened. And she doesn’t want her risking her job as well. Not for her. </span></p><p><span>Agatha stops in front of Rio, placing both hands on Rio’s cheeks, tilting her head up toward her. “Please.”</span></p><p><span>The force of it goes straight through her, starting to unravel her resolve.  </span></p><p><span>“This isn’t your fault,” Rio reiterates. </span></p><p><span>“I’m not doing this because I think it is.” Agatha pushes back from Rio. “I’m doing this because I finally get to fight back. Even if it’s through you. I get to have a voice against her. Finally.” There is an underlying anger in her words. The raw truth of someone fighting to stand her ground.</span></p><p><span>It terrifies Rio to let her step into this war with her, but it might terrify her even more to deny her. </span></p><p><span>Rio smiles. “You can help.”</span></p><p><span>“Yes,” Agatha bounces a little, triumphantly, before grabbing her phone from the kitchen table. She picks it up, clicking around the screen before putting it to her ear. </span></p><p><span>“Billy,” she says into the speaker, “we’ve got some fighting to do. For Rio.”</span></p><p><span>—</span></p><p> </p>

<p>Agatha sits up in bed, the light from the nightstand casting a soft glow as she pours through Rio’s old patient charts, performance reviews, and resident evaluations. Papers are scattered over her lap and the bed, highlighted and underlined like Agatha is the one who is the lawyer. </p><p>“Agatha, let it go,” Rio sighs from her spot next to her in bed. Her voice is heavy with fatigue and stress. “There is nothing more to do. We are ready.” </p><p>“You’re right,” Agatha says even as she underlies another passage. “I just want to make sure we aren’t missing anything. Billy and Alice feel confidence in speaking about their time with you. And the nurse from that night told Lilia she is ready to testify she didn’t see a punch.”</p><p>Rio turns fully toward her, propping up her head in her hand on the pillow. “And you?” She reaches across the bed to rest her palm on Agatha’s bent knee, thumb stroking small circles. </p><p>Agatha stops highlighting, finally looking up. “I’m good. I’m ready. It’s not like she’ll be in the room. She can’t touch me there.” Her words still crack, just slightly at the last sentence, a tiny fissure in her armor that Rio notices. </p><p>“You know, they might question why I was there that night.” Rio says carefully. “I wasn’t the on-call doctor.”</p><p>“Because I asked for you.”</p><p>“They are going to ask why.”</p><p>Agatha pushes the papers and pen off her lap. She climbs over the covers toward Rio, straddling her hips. The pajama shorts ride up to the top of her thighs as she does. Then she leans down, pressing her lips along the side of Rio’s throat. </p><p>“I wanted your sexy ass next to me in the hospital bed,” she teases, deflecting. Rio moans softly, her hands instinctively sliding from Agatha’s hips to her thighs, kneading the flesh there.</p><p>“Mmhmm,” Rio leans into the sensation before snapping back to reality. “Agatha,” she pulls her neck away from Agatha’s lips. “Be serious for a second.” </p><p>“Okay,” Agatha bites her lower lip as her eyes skirt around. </p><p>“I’ve been wanting to ask you. Why don’t you…” she hesitates before finally pushing the words out, “Why not just go work at another hospital?” </p><p>“There isn’t another hospital within 50 miles of here.” Rio rubs her hands up and down Agatha’s legs again, more soothing this time then seduction.  </p><p>“I know,” Agatha’s words rush out a bit. “But you could start fresh somewhere else. Without my mother looming over your career.”</p><p>“I don’t want to move,” Rio says casually, not picking up on Agatha’s vulnerability. “I’ve lived here forever. I like it here.”</p><p>Agatha swallows hard, this time, tilting her head to meet Rio’s eyes. “But are you sure it’s worth it?”</p><p>Rio sees the slight redness along the rim of Agatha’s eyes - a combination of exhaustion and raw emotion. This isn’t about the job. Or the committee. Agatha is asking if she’s worth the fight. The fallout. </p><p>“Come ‘mere.” Rio cups her face in both hands, pulling her closer until their noses brush. Her voice is steady now. “This? This is one hundred percent worth it.” </p><p>Agatha lets out a shaky breath, leaning in softly, to press her lips to Rio’s. Rio’s arms come around her, drawing her closer before rolling them with gentle strength until Agatha is beneath her, her head sinking into the pillow. </p><p>The kiss deepens, slow and unhurried, as Rio’s thigh pushes upward between Agatha’s legs. A small moan escapes her as she moves against the pressure, rolling her hips. Her eyes flutter closed. She smiles into Rio’s lips before rolling them again to ease Rio onto her back. </p><p>This time Agatha takes control when her fingers slide into the waistband of Rio’s pants. Rio’s thighs part just enough for Agatha to find her - already wet and waiting for her. She sinks two fingers in easily, curling instantly. It’s not hurried and reckless like all their times in the hospital. Just tenderness, slow and grounding as she pumps into her. </p><p>Agatha’s mouth traces a path down Rio’s neck, kissing gently along the skin there. Her other hand pushes up Rio’s shirt until it’s bunched up toward her neck. She moves her attention to her breasts - circling her nipple while her other hand cups and kneads the flesh. Rio arches under her touch, her skin burning with the feeling of Agatha’s tongue across her nipple, fingers twisting her other nipple into a peak. Agatha moans as she works, the vibrations sending another wave of arousal through Rio. Agatha’s fingers pump through her, stroking her clit with her thumb. </p><p>“Agatha,” she whispers, her voice shuddering as she comes. Agatha catches her mouth in another kiss, swallowing the sound. Her fingers stay inside her with each pulse, her thumb adding pressure to her clit. Rio finally exhales beneath her, soft and spent. </p><p>When the tremors fade, Agatha eases her hand free. Then she guides her fingers up to Rio’s mouth. She presses lightly until Rio parts her lips, accepting them in her mouth without hesitation. She tastes herself,  salty and sweet, her tongue. Agatha replaces her fingers with her own mouth, the lingering taste of Rio hitting her lips. </p><p>Agatha slides off of her, pulling her shirt down with her gently, covering her back up. “And now you should get some sleep,” she murmurs as she lays her head on Rio’s chest, her hand resting between her breasts. </p><p>Rio leans down, placing a small kiss on the top of her head. “So should you.” </p><p>But neither sleeps well. </p><p>—</p><p>They are nearly silent the next morning, each lost in their own thoughts as they prepare for the committee. Rio dresses in her best suit, the one that comes out very rarely for interviews but still fits her perfectly. </p><p>Over the weekend. Agatha and Rio went out and bought Agatha a new suit, a dark brown three-piece. Agatha felt it best to avoid her house all together, knowing Evanora could be there. So they also stocked up on a few staples for Agatha as well - casual tshirts, shorts, new underwear. Rio kept thinking the whole time how it felt more like packing for a trip than Agatha staying over - temporary, fleeting. She tried to chalk it up to the stress of the committee eating away at her. </p><p>Now, as they approach the hospital, Agatha gives Rio’s hand a quick squeeze before breaking away to slip through a side entrance. </p><p>Rio continues through the front doors, then finds the conference room. It’s still empty, she’s a few minutes early. An old whiteboard sits along a front wall, faint black streaks etched into the surface. A folding divider cuts the room in half. </p><p>Along one side, office chairs have been set up. Four of them with a long folding table in front. A small table and two chairs sit to the side - Rio assumes for her and Lilia. And then there is a single chair in front - interrogation style. </p><p>Rio lets out a shaky breath, trying to calm her nerves. It isn’t court, but hell, it still feels like it. This isn’t just her job, her livelihood, this is her being willing to step into the line of fire for Agatha. It’s a step neither of them have talked about, but it’s been there - lingering in the dark all last night as they each tossed and turned in bed, fighting for sleep. </p><p>She meets Lilia just outside. Her lawyer’s cheerfulness is a bit jarring against the knot forming in Rio’s stomach. Lilia brings her a hot coffee - far too sweet for her liking but it gives her something to occupy her hands. </p><p>The committee finally files into the room and Rio scans the faces, trying to assess what kind of fight this will be. </p><p>She’s surprised to see so few of them. A nursing supervisor that Rio has spoken with only a handful of times named Dottie; the medical director, Hela, who despite her commanding personality actually gets along with Rio and finally someone named Peggy, who judging by her badge is the head of social work. </p><p>It’s smaller than she expected. Plus it’s all women. The group is miles away from anyone in Evanora’s circle and Rio has had nothing but good experiences with each of them. They smile as they pass her, chatting amongst each other as they sit down at the long table. </p><p>However, there is one seat left unoccupied. </p><p>As Rio and Lilia take their seats, she feels her breath steading, finally relaxing a little. Then the final committee member rushes in. </p><p>“Sorry,” he says, winded. “I had some last minute business with Evanora.” He glares at Rio as he speaks, narrowing his eyes. “She had to clarify a few things.” </p><p>“Not a problem, Tony,” Hela remarks. </p><p>Rio’s stomach tightens. </p><p>The chief medical officer. One of Evanora’s right hand men. The kind of guy who never needs proof, only permission. And judging by the death glares he seems to be giving Rio as he takes his seat, he has already decided he isn’t on her side. </p><p>He folds his hands across the table and begins. He announces her suspension for professional misconduct. Rio braces for Evanora’s accusation - that she was unprofessional, even violent during a traumatic encounter involving Evanora’s daughter as a patient. She can live with that, she’s been rehearing her defense for days. </p><p>But Tony keeps going. </p><p>And this time, he’s smiling. </p><p>“There are additional concerns,” he says, flipping the page. “Reports of incompetence as a mentor. And a pattern of inappropriate behavior that, according to Evanora, makes you unfit to supervise residents.” </p><p>Rio can feel her pulse in her ears. She glances at Hela, at Dottie - searching everyone’s face for a sign of disbelief, some flicker that they know this isn’t her. </p><p>But they remain stoic. Flipping through their paperwork and scribbling a few notes in the margins. </p><p>Evanora hadn’t come to just bruise her reputation. She came to bury her career. </p><p>But Lilia is ready, she takes it all in stride, nodding and taking notes. She doesn’t flinch at the words like Rio does. </p><p>When it’s Lilia’s turn, she produces a neatly bound packet and with five years worth of resident evaluations. She hands a copy to each one of them. “Not a single one describes Dr. Vidal as unprofessional,” she says evenly. “Eccentric, perhaps. Overly enthusiastic during codes. But never inappropriate.”</p><p>Tony leans back in his chair, balancing on two of the legs. His tone drips with skepticism. “What changed then? You’ll have me believe a well-respected doctor just snaps one day and assaults the CEO? C’mon, let’s stick to reality here.”  </p><p>“I believe Evanora Harkness has a personal vendetta against my client due to her relationship with her daughter, Agatha Harkness,” Lilia says point blank, crossing her arms. </p><p>“And what is the nature of this relationship?” He raises an eyebrow. </p><p>A few heads turn toward Rio, gauging her expression at the question. She tries not to flinch, not to react. She can even feel Lilia’s eyes aimed at here - like a silent reminder not to hand them ammunition.</p><p>Rio clears her throat. “Can I speak? If you don’t mind.” </p><p>“Go right ahead,” Dottie gestures. </p><p>“Dr. Harkness is my intern. Her mother’s…displeasure for me stems from that relationship.”</p><p>Her gaze drifts for a moment, breaking eye contact with the committee to look at her hands. “I expect a lot from my residents. Not everyone understands the kind of pressure it takes to become great.” </p><p>She swallows, looking up to meet their eyes. “But that’s all it is. Professional.”</p><p>But the words come out too fast, too rehearsed. She’s sure of it. She can feel her throat tightening around the lie. She drops her hands below the table, her fingertips dig into her thighs, pulsing with the energy of her false narrative. </p><p>Lilia doesn’t look at her but she can feel her tension rolling off her in waves. She can hear the way her pen scratches a little too hard at the paper, her eyes never lifting. </p><p>She knows she’s lying. Again. </p><p>Rio swallows hard. At this point, she knows she’s going in head first, too far now to turn back. The truth would only drown what little dignity remains intact. So she keeps her head up, the lie seeping deeper into her, just hoping she doesn’t drown. </p><p>They bring Alice in first to speak. The committee questions her about Rio’s behavior during the day Agatha was admitted. Her answers are clipped and evasive. </p><p>“Nothing stood out to me,” she huffs, looking bored. </p><p>It’s clear within seconds, she thinks the entire meeting is a waste of her time - and Rio can’t help but appreciate her for it. </p><p>When they ask her if Rio has been an effective teacher, Alice shrugs, “I haven’t killed anyone yet, so I guess she’s pretty good.” </p><p>The committee dismisses her after only five minutes. </p><p>When Billy enters, he looks like he’s the one on trial. He nervously waves to Rio, who simply nods back. </p><p>“Have you ever witnessed any inappropriate behavior from Dr. Vidal?” Hela asks as soon as he introduces himself. </p><p>Billy hesitates, his brow furrowing. He starts bouncing his knee as he speaks. “What do you mean by ‘inappropriate’?” </p><p>God dammit Billy. It immediately sounds like he’s hinting at something; the words too cautious, too knowing. A few members of the committee tilt their heads, looking between each other. </p><p>“Has Dr. Vidal ever acted in a way that you felt was unwarranted given the current situation; either toward you, another physician or a patient?”</p><p>Billy gives a shocked look. “No, no. She’s the best with patients. They all love her. And she’s such a good teacher.”</p><p>He keeps going, words tripping over each other in a desperate attempt to fill the silence. “I mean she’s close with some residents. More than others. Like Agatha - but she just pushes her harder. And they seem to get each other. Like they bonded early on. Like a mentor. Or friend or…</p><p>“Interesting that he brings up Agatha,” Tony notes, barely under his breath. </p><p>“Billy, I think they get it,” Lilia cuts him off, trying to salvage the conversation. “Dr. Vidal has been mentoring Dr. Harkness given the potential she sees in her. And unless the committee intends to punish her for effective teaching, I suggest we move on.” </p><p>Billy’s mouth shuts with an audible click. He stares down at the table, suddenly fascinated by the grainy pattern. </p><p>Suddenly, his pager alarms. The loud, beeping noise cuts through the small room. He flinches at the sound, then immediately moves to silence it, glances at the number quickly. </p><p>“Uh, patient emergency,” he shrugs, standing to leave. </p><p>He throws Rio an apologetic glance as he passes. “Sorry” he mouths - either for the poor testimony or his early exit, she isn’t sure which. </p><p>But, she’s almost positive the pager was Agatha’s doing. A false emergency meant to cut him off early before he stuck his foot in his mouth. </p><p>A worthy effort at least. </p><p>Lilia then arranged a parade worth of attendings to come by, one by one, giving short explanations as to their time working with Rio. </p><p>Each one gives her glowing reviews. A testament to her years of service, her commitment to teaching and her love for the staff. </p><p>By the end, it feels a little overkill. Excessive and polished. Like too much sugar coating. Even Rio starts to feel uncomfortable with the praise.</p><p>But then it’s Agatha’s turn. </p><p>Rio holds her breath as she enters the room. She looks composed - her hair pulled back into a braid, her brown suit ironed and crisp. Confidence radiates off her as she takes a seat in the empty chair. </p><p>But she doesn’t look at Rio. Not a flicker, no acknowledgment. She fixes her eyes straight ahead on the committee. </p><p>“Please state your name and position,” Peggy says casually. </p><p>“Doctor Agatha Harkness, first year internal medicine resident.”</p><p>“How long have you been working with Dr. Vidal?”</p><p>“Six months.” </p><p>“And how would you describe her teaching style?”</p><p>“Effective.” She doesn’t elaborate. Every answer is fast, to the point, without details. </p><p>Rio can feel the committee’s impatience begin to simmer - restless pauses that follow each answer, subtle lift of brows, the expectant silence as they wait for Agatha to say more. But she doesn’t. </p><p>“What about your relationship with her?” Tony probes again. And she’s almost certain he’s already been coached on which nerves to touch. </p><p>“What about it?” Agatha bites back. </p><p>“How would you describe your relationship with Dr. Vidal?” </p><p>“It’s great.” Agatha crosses her arms, leaning back. She projects ease, even disinterest. Her expression borders on bored, like the entire line of questioning is beneath her. </p><p>Tony stills his pen on his page. “That’s it?” He raises an eyebrow.</p><p>“That’s all there is to say.” Her voice is clipped. </p><p>“Okay,” he sighs loudly. “Let’s move on to the night in question. You were admitted under Dr. Vidal’s care for a trauma, is that correct?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“What was the nature of that trauma?”</p><p>Her eyes narrow. “I don’t see how that’s relevant.”</p><p>The committee members exchange quiet glances, surprised by the pushback. </p><p>“Dr. Harkness, you aren’t being interrogated here. We are just trying to get answers,” Dottie speaks up finally. </p><p>“I don’t think my personal medical history falls under that umbrella,” she snaps, her composure hardening further. </p><p>“Fine,” Tony snaps, the vein in his temple starting to pop out. “But did your mother come visit your room that night?” He says it like it already knows the answer, his voice far too casual. </p><p>“She did,” Agatha swallows. “But I didn’t ask her to come. She just showed up.”</p><p>Rio bites her lip. Agatha’s disdain for her mother is a bit obvious in the way she spits out her words. Rio wishes she could silently tell her to rein it in a bit.</p><p>“And did Dr. Vidal hit her as she claims?” </p><p>“I did not witness that.” The lie slips out smoothly. </p><p>“Your mother has a picture showing bruising along her face. Where did it come from?”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t flinch. She doesn’t even blink. “I have no idea. She’s pretty old and frail. She could have fallen. She probably doesn’t even remember it.” She pauses, letting her words hang as they soak in. “You know,” she adds, a subtle edge in her voice. “She might be getting a little senile.” Then she raises an eyebrow, “Maybe you should start questioning if she’s fit for her position.”</p><p>The air shifts as the tension in the room increases. A ripple of discomfort spreads across the table - one committee member clears her throat, another shifts in their chair. </p><p>Agatha doesn’t look uncomfortable though. She looks…perfectly in her element. Pleased with the chaos she carefully curated.</p><p>“That’s quite the accusation,” Even Tony looks startled. “Are you suggesting the CEO is unfit for her job?”</p><p>“I’m saying maybe you should look into that instead of this red herring.” </p><p>“Or perhaps,” he continues, redness rising in his face. “You’re being an ungrateful brat of a daughter who is just angry at her mother for kicking you out?” </p><p>Rio’s mouth visibly drops open. Even Lilia gasps. </p><p>“What are you fucking her or something?” Agatha spits out. “How the fuck would you know my living situation?” Her fists ball in her lap. </p><p>Tony slams his hands onto the table, the papers rattling a bit. “How dare you!” He bellows. “You will not speak to me that way. I could end your career!” He threatens.</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha’s tongue clicks. “Mommy wouldn’t like that,” she mocks. </p><p>“Enough.” Hela raises her hand as Tony opens his mouth to speak again, stopping him. “Tony, Dr. Harkness. This isn’t helping.” Her voice remains controlled. “One more outburst, Tony, and we are going to ask you to dismiss yourself.” </p><p>Tony’s chest heaves, his face still red and angry. He looks like he might argue. He throws up his hands, gesturing vaguely at Agatha as if to say ‘you are letting her get away with this?’</p><p>No one takes the bait. The committee moves on, shuffling papers around them. </p><p>Tony sinks back into his chair to cross his arms. He continues muttering under his breath. </p><p>Rio’s hands still itch to move - to stand and yell, defend Agatha - and herself. But halfway through she felt Lilia’s hand on her shoulder, keeping her rooted firmly in her chair. </p><p>“Moving on,” Dottie lets out a long sigh. “How would you describe Dr. Vidal as an attending?”</p><p>“Brilliant,” Agatha starts immediately, her eyes meeting the other committee members. Her lips curl into a coy smile. She has the floor now. And she knows Tony can’t say anymore without getting further reprimanded. </p><p>She folds her hands in the lap, the tension of the last few moments rolling off of her. Then she really starts to lay it on sweetly. “She cares, not only about her job but about people. She cares about her patients, her residents more fiercely than I’ve ever seen.”</p><p>The committee seems satisfied with that answer, jotting down a few notes and nodding. </p><p>Rio lets out a sigh. Things are getting better. They can do this. Her answer was perfect, just like the rehearsed. Simple, to the point and makes her look good. </p><p>But Agatha continues, “To answer your earlier question, our relationship has been professional.” She pauses. Her lashes lower briefly before she lifts her gaze again - this time her eyes go straight to Rio.  “I would be lying if I said it hasn’t been personal too.”</p><p>Rio can see Tony lean in as she speaks, waiting for a bomb to drop. </p><p>Agatha’s eyes widen, the blue somehow more icy, more piercing than usual. A look Rio has seen before. Only a few times. An intimate look that feels like it’s been reserved only for her. </p><p>Rio’s heart drops. No, no, not here. She’s internally begging Agatha not to reveal more. This isn’t what they talked about, not what they practiced. She’s going wildly off script. Rio bites her lip and tries ever so subtly to shake her head. </p><p>But Agatha keeps going, her eyes soft and locked onto hers. “She’s been my compass these last few months. The reason I’ve kept going when I thought I couldn’t. The person I look for when I walk into any room, even before I realize I’m doing it.” </p><p>Rio blinks, the words settling somewhere in her chest. It’s not an outright admission. Not one the committee will recognize anyway. But Rio sees it. She hears it. Loud and clear. </p><p>She’s hers. In every way possible. </p><p>Agatha blinks at the admission, a bit startled by it, but quickly gathers her composure.</p><p>“If you take her away, you don’t just lose a physician. You lose someone irreplaceable. To this hospital. To her patients.” She bites her lip, her voice so soft it’s mostly unrecognizable. “To me.”</p><p>Rio swears the room blurs around her, her focus narrowing in on the way Agatha stares at her, eyes soft, a small smile across her lips. Like it’s just the two of them there, whispering secrets between each other. </p><p>“That’s quite the admission,” Rio hears a female voice from the committee cuts in, the words slicing the moment apart. </p><p>She blinks a few times, the room coming back into focus. </p><p>Agatha coughs then, tilting her chin up and straightening her shoulders like she’s resetting herself.  “She’s just a good doctor, that’s all,” She shrugs like she said nothing of importance. </p><p>But the words burn in Rio’s chest, warm and steady. Agatha defended her, claimed her. Risked her job for her just as much as Rio did. </p><p>Finally, the committee dismisses Lilia and Rio, stating they will talk and email her with a final decision.</p><p>Rio feels hollow. Exhaustion presses behind her eyes, frustration sitting heavy in her chest. Her interns shouldn’t have been subjected to this shit. But at the same time, she feels like it must be worth it - for her. For Agatha. </p><p>They are halfway down the corridor when a voice calls out behind them. </p><p>“Hold on,” Hela yells down the hall. “We need to speak with you.”</p><p>Rio’s stomach drops. No committee reaches a verdict that fast. Not unless it’s bad. </p><p>They don’t even have Rio sit again when she enters the room. She just stands at the doorway awkwardly, her hand clutched around the phone in her hand. </p><p>“We’ve agreed there is not enough evidence that Dr. Vidal demonstrated any professional misconduct that night,” Hela states, her tone professional. </p><p>Tony sits slouched in his chair, his eyes glued to his phone screen. He looks indifferent, angry - likely outvoted in the decision. </p><p>“Apart from Evanora’s word, no one else saw anything out of sorts,” Hela continues. “Nothing in her records, past conduct or evaluations suggest a pattern of behavior that warrants suspension.” </p><p>Rio lets out a shaky sigh. </p><p>They won. They actually won. </p><p>Lilia places her hand on her forearm, a quiet congratulations between them.</p><p>“With that said,” she continues, “there are some concerns about the nature of Dr. Vidal’s relationships with residents that may be pushing the lines of professionalism.” </p><p>The relief is short lived. </p><p>Across the table, Tony looks up for the first time. His lips curl into a small, smug smile. He raises his eyebrow like he’s satisfied with the small victory. </p><p>“At this time, we elect Dr. Vidal not continue to have residents under her care,” Hela concludes. </p><p>Fuck. </p><p>“She can resume work immediately. Independently.” Then she gathers her papers, leaving no room for questions. </p><p>The committee shuffles out of the room, murmuring between each other. As Tony passes her, his shoulder bumps her, deliberate and malicious. “Oops,” he murmurs in a mocking tone. </p><p>Rio feels stiff, rooted in the place where they left her. The victory feels thin, almost false. They gave her what they could, and stripped away everything else.</p><p>For a moment, she just stands there, Lilia beside her, quiet, waiting for her to move. Then something inside her steadies and she reaches a resolve. </p><p>Evanora will keep trying to take her down piece by piece. To take them down. So she’s going to reclaim her power with something she can’t touch, something that she is sure is still hers alone. </p><p>— </p><p>“So?” Agatha runs to meet her in the hallway, but she keeps her voice low. </p><p>“I got my job back,” Rio manages a tired smile. </p><p>Agatha looks at her excitedly, ready to wrap her arms around Rio in a hug. She spots Lilia at her side and quickly drops her arms, opting for a nod instead. </p><p>Lilia’s eyes narrow at the exchange. Then she turns to Rio, “I’ll call you,” she says before turning away to leave them. </p><p>Rio hovers her hand over Agatha’s lower back as soon as Lilia turns away. “Hey,” she softens her voice. “Let’s walk.” </p><p>Rio starts leading Agatha toward the back of the hospital, into the stairwell. As soon as the door clicks shut, Agatha wraps her arms around Rio. She plants a quick kiss on her lips.</p><p>“We did it!” she grins, pulling back just enough to search Rio’s face. But Rio’s smile doesn’t stay.</p><p>“Agatha…” she starts. </p><p>“Oh no,” Agatha interrupts, groaning. “I know that tone. What’s wrong? Why aren’t you more happy about this?”</p><p>“It’s good. Don’t get me wrong,” Rio starts carefully. “They let me have my job back. But…” She hesitates. “That’s it. They won’t let me supervise residents anymore. They’re concerned I’ve crossed boundaries.”</p><p>“Wait, no. I didn’t mean anything, I swear…” She starts to pull backward out of Rio’s arms. </p><p>Rio tightens her grip on her waist. “Agatha.” </p><p>“Okay, maybe not nothing, but nothing obvious.”</p><p>Rio sighs. “Billy was worse.”</p><p>Her eyes widen. “Then they can’t do this! It’s not right. We should…”</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio says again, her voice softening. “You have to be a doctor on your own too. You’ll still have an attending. It just won’t be me.”</p><p>“But..” Her eyes meet Rio’s. “I need you.”</p><p>“No, you don’t.” Rio brushes a thumb along her cheek. “You can do this without me. I’ll still be here, just… not over your shoulder.”</p><p>Agatha frowns. “Then how am I supposed to sneak around with you if I hardly get to see you?” She adds a slight pout to her expression.</p><p>“That’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about.”</p><p>“How to still have sex in the hospital?”</p><p>Rio laughs quietly. “No. I was thinking… maybe we wouldn’t have to sneak around the hospital at all.”</p><p>Agatha blinks, uncertain. “Okay?”</p><p>“You’ve been staying with me for a week,” Rio says. “But what’s your long-term plan?”</p><p>“I, uh…” Agatha shifts, biting her lip. She looks slightly embarrassed. “I hadn’t really thought about it. I don’t want to go back to my mother’s. I think she cut off my cards anyway. They stopped working the day after my ‘accident.’ I could get my own place, or maybe Billy needs a roommate, but he’s sooo messy…” </p><p>“Agatha.” Rio catches her rambling, fingertips tilting her chin up. “Hey. Look at me.”</p><p>Agatha stills.</p><p>“I’m asking you to move in with me.”</p><p> </p>

<p> </p><p><span>“Rio…” Agatha hesitates, her hands coming up to rest on Rio’s wrists where they cradle her face. </span></p><p><span>“Agatha, move in with me.” Rio says again, her voice steady and sure. She leans down to kiss Agatha softly, but she feels Agatha stiffen beneath her lips. </span></p><p><span>“You don’t know what you are asking,” she whispers. </span></p><p><span>“Yes I do,” Rio insists. “I come home from work and you are there. We have dinner together. We go to bed together. We buy stupid little pumpkins on Halloween and get a tiny tree for Christmas.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinks hard. Rio can see the tears brimming along the edges of her eyes, threatening to fall. She can’t tell if they are out of joy and pain.</span></p><p><span>“Can we just talk about this later?” Her voice is small. </span></p><p><span>“We can just talk about this now.”</span></p><p><span>“I can’t.” The words rip out of her. “Just…I have patients to see. It’s been a long morning already.” Agatha’s hands slip from Rio’s wrists. She takes a step back, then another, eyes flicking everywhere but Rio’s face. </span></p><p><span>“That’s a lot of excuses.”</span></p><p><span>“I know,” Agatha starts backing up toward the hospital door as she speaks.“We’ll just…let’s talk later ok?” Agatha offers her a small smile. But it’s too thin and it doesn’t quite reach her eyes. </span></p><p><span>“Agatha,” her words come out somewhere between a plea and a warning. </span></p><p><span>“I’ll be around,” Agatha blurts, too fast, the words tumbling out like she’s hardly thinking about them. </span></p><p><span>Then she turns and bolts for the hospital door. The glass catches a flash of her reflection before it swings shut, sealing her away. </span></p><p><span>Rio doesn’t move. She swears her feet are molded into the cement beneath her because they suddenly feel so heavy that she can’t lift them.</span></p><p><span>She can barely fathom what just happened. Agatha was in her bed just this morning. Her mouth was on her last night. They were happy and content living in the bubble of her house. Agatha said she was willing to go to war for her - and she did. What the hell just changed?</span></p><p><span>She wants to fold into herself. Right here. In the middle of the damn hospital courtyard.</span></p><p><span>But she has to go about her day. She doesn’t have a choice. She </span><em><span>just</span></em><span> fought tooth and nail for her job - her job that now feels hollow, stupid without Agatha. She wants to just turn around, walk into the parking lot, get in her car and never look back. </span></p><p><span>And she could.</span></p><p><span>What does she have tying her here? </span></p><p><span>Two days ago, she knew what it was. Agatha. </span></p><p><span>Agatha, who just walked away from her the second she got to close.</span></p><p><span>Before she realizes it, her feet are moving - carrying her across the sidewalk, through the parking lot to her car. Her hand closes around her door handle before her brain catches up. </span></p><p><span>She loves her. </span></p><p><span>She really fucking loves her.</span></p><p><span>And she knows…okay, she </span><em><span>thinks</span></em><span>…that under all her fear, Agatha loves her too. </span></p><p><span>She’s not about to let that go without a fight. </span></p><p><span>Maybe it is sheer delusion driving those thoughts.</span></p><p><span>She tells herself Agatha chose her. So much so that she was injured by her mother. So much so that she called off the wedding.</span></p><p><span>She did, didn’t she? </span></p><p><span>It feels like Rio found a loose thread she can’t stop pulling - with every tug, something inside her unravels. </span></p><p><span>Her pager sounds loudly in her pocket, bringing her back down to earth. </span></p><p><span>Fuck. She has a list of patients. All sitting there in the hospital, waiting to be seen.</span></p><p><span>She swallows the small amount of bile bubbling up in the throat and crosses the parking lot again. Back to her job.</span></p><p><span>—</span></p><p><span>Rio feels like a robot.</span></p><p><span>Every patient gets reduced to a list - complaint, diagnostics, diagnosis, treatment. She’s the kind of doctor she would hate - blunt but efficient, in and out of the room in minutes. She leaves the nurses to console the family members, and the social worker to deal with the aftermath. She charts on autopilot. </span></p><p><span>It’s nearly two hours before she spots her. </span></p><p><span>Agatha is at a nurses’ station, huddled close to Jen. They are bent over a monitor, printing an EKG strip before sitting down to analyze it. </span></p><p><span>Agatha looks…fine. </span></p><p><span>She doesn’t look like she just put her entire heart on the line this morning. Then ripped Rio’s right out of her chest and stomped on it. </span></p><p><span>She reaches into her white coat pocket, pulls out a pair of calipers, starting to measure the intervals on the strip. </span></p><p><span>She focuses on analyzing it, her brow furrowed.</span></p><p><span>Then something shifts. </span></p><p><span>Her gaze flickers, just for a second, but Rio catches it. Agatha’s eyes drift to the floor, unfocused. They seem to gloss over, like a memory playing back before her eyes. </span></p><p><span>The calipers fall softly from her hand onto the table. Her hand rises almost absently, brushing her lips.  </span></p><p><span>For a moment, she looks…sad. </span></p><p><span>And then it’s gone. She straightens, shakes her head as if physically forcing the thought away, and goes back to the EKG. </span></p><p><span>Rio stands at the other end of the hall, half-hidden by her laptop screen resting on the desk. But her eyes never leave Agatha. </span></p><p><span>She tells herself to keep working and stop looking. But her body won’t listen. It’s like watching a car crash in slow motion - Agatha rises from the desk, folding the EKG and shoving it into her coat pocket. Her hands stay buried there. She starts making her way down the hall, toward Rio, her eyes focused downward on her shoes. </span></p><p><span>Rio’s breath catches when she realizes the path leads straight toward her. </span></p><p><span>Suddenly, Agatha looks up, and she sees her. </span></p><p><span>They make eye contact. </span></p><p><span>Rio’s chest feels too tight, her pulse thudding behind her ribs. </span></p><p><span>Agatha freezes mid-step, her lips parting just slightly, like she wants to say something - anything. </span></p><p><span>But nothing comes. </span></p><p><span>Instead, she turns sharply on her heel, almost colliding with a passing nurse. She mutters a quick apology as she heads in the other direction. Her pace quickens - first brisk, then urgent until she’s nearly running.</span></p><p><span>And just like that, she’s gone again. </span></p><p><span>–</span></p><p><span>Rio finishes her day way earlier than she ever did when she had interns. No bedside rounding, no teaching, no charts to sign. Just silence.</span></p><p><span>It’s only early evening but Rio doesn’t want to go home yet. Not when it’s going to be so quiet there, the scent of Agatha still lingering in the air. Her toothbrush still sits on the counter, her oatmilk in the fridge, some overly priced shampoo in the shower. </span></p><p><span>Rio knows she won’t move any of it. A tiny shrine to Agatha like she might come home one day. </span></p><p><span>She realizes how pathetic it seems. But still, she grabs dinner from the cafeteria, packing it into a to-go container before taking the elevator to the fifth floor. She then takes the stairs up to the sixth. </span></p><p><span>The abandoned equipment floor looks almost identical to how they left it weeks ago, apart from a few additional discharged boxes and one more broken hospital bed. </span></p><p><span>She pushes a wobbly bed over near the window, angling it just enough to see the last bits of the sunset over the parking lot. </span></p><p><span>She’s not two bites into her food when she hears footsteps behind her, coming toward her. They stop abruptly, pause for a second then seem to retreat. </span></p><p><span>“You can’t avoid me forever,” Rio says without turning around. </span></p><p><span>She’s met with only silence. For a moment, she thinks she imagined it. </span></p><p><span>“I’m not avoiding you,” comes Agatha’s voice behind her, low and careful. </span></p><p><span>Rio huffs. “You literally ran the other way when you saw me in the hall today.”</span></p><p><span>“I had remembered something I needed to do for a patient.”</span></p><p><span>“You know,” Rio says, turning her head slightly. “Others might think you are a great liar, but I watch you, Agatha. I see right through you. What are you doing here?” </span></p><p><span>Agatha’s reply is small. “I needed some quiet.” </span></p><p><span>Rio’s mouth curves, not quite a smile, but more a bitter smirk. “Realized you have no place to go after work?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stiffens. “Don’t do that to me. Don’t try to hurt me just because I hurt you.” </span></p><p><span>Now Rio finally turns to face her fully, dangling her legs off the edge of the bed.</span></p><p><span>She looks less put together than she expected, like the hardened shell of confidence has tiny cracks in it. Tendrils of hair fall from her ponytail, framing her face. She looks exhausted. </span></p><p><span>“Are you going to finally talk to me then?” Rio asks.</span></p><p><span>Agatha shakes her head, blinking too fast. “You think this is easy for me?”</span></p><p><span>“No,” Rio says. “That’s the problem, I think you are making it harder than it needs to be.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha lets out a disbelieving scoff, but she moves anyway, closing the space between them. She stops directly in front of where Rio sits on the bed.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s legs fall open instinctively, a silent invitation. Agatha steps in, close enough that Rio’s knees brush her thighs. They stay like that, like they are savoring some quiet moment of peace. </span></p><p><span>Rio’s hand comes up to brush her knuckles along Agatha’s cheek. Her skin is warm where Agatha leans into her touch. </span></p><p><span>In a last ditch effort, she decides to just admit it all. Rip her own heart out and offer it to Agatha. “I think I’m…I’m falling…”</span></p><p><span>“Don’t.” Agatha cuts her off. It’s too much. I can’t…” Agatha whispers. She turns her head, her cheek dragging against Rio’s hand as she pulls away. </span></p><p><span>Rio furrows her brow, her voice fragile. “Then what did you mean in there, Agatha?” </span></p><p><span>“I meant what I said,” Agatha swallows hard. “You’ve been my constant support. And…” </span></p><p><span>“And?”</span></p><p><span>“Those feelings are real Rio. I just…I don’t know what they mean yet.”</span></p><p><span>“They don’t have to mean anything. They can just mean us. Being together.”</span></p><p><span>“I want to, don’t get me wrong.” Agatha says, her voice rushed. “But this…the injury, the suspension, me staying with you, the committee. It’s just a lot,” her voice falters, “It’s just a lot, really fast.” </span></p><p><span>“What are you saying?” Rio shakes her head like she’s refusing to hear it. “Agatha, don’t do this to me….” </span></p><p><span>She swears the world starts spinning around her because there is no other explanation for this. She can see the writing on the wall. And she can feel it too. Not just emotionally. Agatha is physically stepping backwards from her, shoulder curling inward, retreating inch by inch. </span></p><p><span>“Maybe we should just take some time. To just think.” </span></p><p><span>“Agatha, please,” Rio pleads. “Look how far we’ve come already. Look at everything we’ve sacrificed.” </span></p><p><span>“That’s what I’m saying, Rio.” Her voice cracks, giving way to more frustration. “We keep giving little pieces of ourselves and our jobs away to make this work. At what point is it just too hard? It shouldn’t be this hard.” </span></p><p><span>“You’re just scared.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha just huffs in response. “Scared? Look at what you are asking of me. I’ve been a doctor for six months. Six.” </span></p><p><span>“No one in the history of this residency has had special treatment like you.” </span></p><p><span>“Is that supposed to make me feel better?” Agatha’s tone rises now, her words sharper. </span></p><p><span>“You asked me if it was worth it,” Rio says, her voice strained, edging on frustration. “I told you it was.” </span></p><p><span>“But you didn’t ask me. What about me, Rio?” Rio opens her mouth to respond, but Agatha barrels on. “Have you thought at all about how this affects me? I’ve been living under my mother’s roof my entire life. My life that has been planned out for me. I don’t even know how to be on my own.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha laughs now, something hollow, almost delirious. “I’ve been hiding everything for years. And now what? I’m supposed to tell everyone that I left my fiancé to shack up with my attending who is double my age?” </span></p><p><span>Rio doesn’t have a response. The words just hang there, out in the open - because they’re true. </span></p><p><span>Finally, Agatha breaks the silence. “Can you please just give me time?”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s throat tightens. “How much time, Agatha?”</span></p><p><span>“I don’t know.” </span></p><p><span>Rio stares at the ground. She can’t look at her in the next moments because she knows what’s coming next and she doesn’t want to watch. </span></p><p><span>“Don’t follow me, Rio.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha looks at her one last time, eyes glassy, then turns away. It’s not until the sound of her footsteps fade down the hall, that Rio finally looks up. </span></p><p><span>She just sits there for a long time, staring at the doorway like if she waits long enough, Agatha might walk back through it. </span></p><p><span>But she doesn’t. </span></p><p><span>The sunset has died outside the window by the time she stands, her dinner long since untouched. She drags her hand through her hair, swallowing hard against the lump rising in her throat. </span></p><p><span>The ache sits too deep to cry, too raw to be angry. It’s just </span><em><span>there. </span></em></p><p><em><span> </span></em><span>— </span></p><p><span>Rio calls Natasha before she even makes it out of the hospital. </span></p><p><span>“This about the committee?” Natasha answers as soon as it rings.</span></p><p><span>“Worse.”</span></p><p><span>“Bar?” She questions and Rio can already hear her picking up her keys in the background.</span></p><p><span>“I’ll meet you there.”</span></p><p><span>Rio doesn’t bother changing out of her scrubs. She just drives. Her fingers ache from how hard she grips the steering wheel, eyes burning the whole way there. She tries not to think about the course of the entire day. How it started so well, Agatha in her passenger’s seat, her fingers brushing along her thigh as she drove. How she was her quiet strength as they drove into the parking lot. How she kissed her quickly before getting out of the car, reassuring her it would all be okay. </span></p><p><span>And now, hours later, she’s alone, her chest feeling hollow, her brain numb from all the words they threw at each other. It feels impossible that it’s over, but it makes sense all the same. They were two sparks on dry kindling, the resulting fire growing wildly out of control in an instant. </span></p><p><span>She beats Natasha there by a few minutes and sinks into a corner stool, away from everyone. </span></p><p><span>When Natasha finally slides onto the stool beside her, she takes one look at Rio’s face and sighs. “Oh, sweetheart.” </span></p><p><span>Natasha orders them both whiskey, but as Rio’s sits in front of her, she just stares at the amber liquid. She takes a long inhale, then starts telling Natasha everything. From the beginning - the call room, the sneaking around, even Agatha’s drunken night. It all comes barreling forward, tumbling out of her mouth like word vomit. </span></p><p><span>“Sounds like you two are toxic together,” Natasha says finally. </span></p><p><span>When Rio laughs, it’s hollow and cold. “We’re not.” But she’s not sure she believes her own words. </span></p><p><span>“You’re toxically obsessed with each other,” Natasha counters. “To the point where neither of you can function.” </span></p><p><span>“She’s not obsessed with me.” Rio takes a long sip of her drink. </span></p><p><span>“You sure?” Natasha’s tone is gentle. </span></p><p><span>Rio swallows. “She said it was moving too fast. That she wanted space. Doesn’t even sound like she wants me.” </span></p><p><span>“Or,” Natasha says, leaning closer. “She’s so obsessed it scares her. So she runs. See? Toxic. Both of you.” </span></p><p><span>“So what?” Rio murmurs. “It’s never going to work? Is that what you’re saying?” She downs the rest of her drink in one gulp. The liquor burns all the way down, her eyes stinging as it hits. </span></p><p><span>Natasha shakes her head. “No. It could work. But you both have to stop hurting each other just to feel close to each other.”</span></p><p><span>Rio stares down at her now empty drink. “I’ve tried. It’s like none of it matters.”</span></p><p><span>“Have you really, though?” </span></p><p><span>Maybe it’s the alcohol, too much too fast, or maybe it’s the quiet ache that’s been building all night - but Rio’s hand moves before she can think. She runs her fingers along Natasha’s arm, nails dragging lightly against her skin.</span></p><p><span>She can forget her. Fill the voice with someone else. Another body. It could work. She just has to get the never ending picture of Agatha out of her head. Somehow. </span></p><p><span>“Like old times?” Her fingers lock around Natasha’s wrist, tugging her slightly closer to her along the bar top. </span></p><p><span>For a heartbeat, Natasha leans in. Her eyes flicker, half-lidded. Then she lets out a long, tired sigh. </span></p><p><span>“You don’t want this distraction, Rio.” Natasha pulls her arm away. “Not me. Not tonight. You want her. And the only way you’ll get her back is if she wants to come back.”</span></p><p><span>Rio can feel the tears prickling the back of her eyes, part shame, part sadness. “And if she doesn’t?”</span></p><p><span>“Then it wasn’t meant to be.” </span></p><p><span>Rio nods, but its hollow. It’s everything and nothing she wanted to hear. </span></p><p><span>—</span></p><p><span>Every day is torture. </span></p><p><span>Okay maybe torture is a bit dramatic. But every day still sucks ass.</span></p><p><span>Because every single day, Rio now has to step foot in the hospital alone. Everyday she sees the call room where they slept together, the hallways where they shared secret kisses, the conference room where Agatha defended her. Everyday she eats lunch on the damn equipment floor where Agatha asked for more time. </span></p><p><span>Time.</span></p><p><span>Such a vague term.</span></p><p><span>How much time is enough? Does Rio wave in the hallway, pretend it’s normal, hoping that one day Agatha turns around and says she’s ready?</span></p><p><span>Does she attempt to move on - knowing full well she can’t? Is she allowed to ask how long she’s supposed to wait before this silence means it’s really over?</span></p><p><span>The whole thing is bullshit. And a little elementary. </span></p><p><span>But what’s that saying “if you love something let it go; if it comes back, it’s yours?”</span></p><p><span>Also bullshit. </span></p><p><span>Work at least keeps her moving, even if it’s slowly crushing her. The hospital is drowning in flu admissions, overloading Rio (and everyone else’s) caseload. Rio swears months go by, but when she looks at the calendar, it’s only been a few weeks. </span></p><p><span>Today at least she has something different. Worse but different. </span></p><p><span>A woman, in her 40’s, Rio’s age. Except she came into the emergency room with stomach pain one day and walked out with a stage 4 cancer diagnosis. </span></p><p><span>Both her and her husband want to fight it - doing anything and everything. Rio connects with her instantly, promising to work as hard as she can to get her treatment. </span></p><p><span>Then things spiral. She has a reaction to the first chemotherapy, and has a gene mutation that means the second one won’t work. </span></p><p><span>Oncology has said she needs experimental chemotherapy. She’s exhausted all other options. </span></p><p><span>And of course - the drugs aren’t FDA-approved for her condition. And expensive as hell. </span></p><p><span>“Shit!” Rio slams her fist into the counter next to her. She’s claimed one of the oncology wing desks, surrounded by stacks of grant applications, research papers and pharmaceutical trial lists - every possible avenue. All of them dead ends. </span></p><p><span>“You okay over there?” The voice to her right makes her jump. </span></p><p><span>“I’m fine, Agatha,” she grates without looking up. </span></p><p><span>It’s like this most days. She can’t completely avoid Agatha. They see each other in the conference rooms, pass near each other in hallways, glance awkwardly at each other during lunches. </span></p><p><span>There is usually a courteous “hi” or “how are you,” before they both retreat back behind their professional walls. </span></p><p><span>Nothing more. </span></p><p><span>They never linger. Never touch. </span></p><p><span>Occasionally Billy is nearby muttering about how ridiculous they are both being. </span></p><p><span>Today something changes. </span></p><p><span>Rio can feel Agatha rise from her chair beside her, the faint shuffle of her feet moving closer. </span></p><p><span>Rio doesn’t move, she keeps her eyes straight ahead, glued to the papers in front of her. </span></p><p><span>Agatha steps in behind her, close enough that Rio can feel the warmth of her body at her back. She leans over, peering at the research papers spread across the desk. </span></p><p><span>“You’re trying to get Blincyto for a patient?” Agatha’s voice is soft, curious. </span></p><p><span>“Yes?” Rio replies, her voice clipped. </span></p><p><span>“It’s like $70,000 a month.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m aware. But my patient doesn’t have any other options.”</span></p><p><span>“And insurance denied it?” Agatha asks. </span></p><p><span>“Of course,” Rio murmurs. </span></p><p><span>Agatha folds her arms, thinking. “Then appeal to Evanora. The hospital has charitable funds set aside for cases like this. It would make them look good.” </span></p><p><span>Rio lets out a dry laugh. “Ha! Like she’d approve of that coming from me.” </span></p><p><span>“You never know.” Agatha shrugs. “This is professional, not personal.”</span></p><p><span>Rio glances sideways, lips curling. “What, do you have a soft spot for her now?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha doesn’t bite. She simply ignores her, stepping backward and straightening. </span></p><p><span>Then as if nothing happened, she asks, “Are you coming to the gala tonight?”</span></p><p><span>“That stupid hospital fundraiser?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha nods once. “Pretty sure everyone’s expected to go.” </span></p><p><span>Rio sticks her tongue in her cheek. “Are you going?” She tries not to sound too hopeful, and fails.</span></p><p><span>Agatha hesitates, just long enough for Rio to notice. “Yeah,” she says finally, meeting her eyes. “I’ll be there.” Her words are soft, almost tentative. Or maybe Rio is just imagining it. She doesn’t know anymore, and part of her doesn’t care. If she can only see Agatha in passing like this, small crumbs of pleasantries, she’ll take it.</span></p><p><span>“I guess I will to then.” Rio swallows hard. </span></p><p><span>Agatha presses her lips together, nodding, then turns to walk away. A few steps later, she stops, turning toward Rio. “I’ll see you there then.” </span></p><p><span>Rio turns back to her papers, a faint blush across her cheeks. </span></p><p><span>— </span></p><p> </p>

<p> </p><p><span>The gala is every bit as ridiculous as Rio expected it to be. </span></p><p><span>The hospital has taken over a downtown conference center, the beige wells she remembers have vanished beneath layers of white linen. The tables are covered in oversized flower arrangements and fine china. Waiters roam between tables with trays of champagne and appetizers. </span></p><p><span>Local big wigs and business owners mingle with the hospital higher ups - everyone kissing everyone’s ass in hopes of more money. </span></p><p><span>Apart from the ridiculous $500 a head ticket cost (that every doctor was “voluntold” to pay), Rio isn’t sure how this event  is supposed to raise money and not spend it. </span></p><p><span>Luckily, Rio had a few dresses in the back of her closet for occasions such as this. Tonight she opted for a red dress - one with a long cut out of her stomach and a way too high slit up her thigh. It isn’t subtle. But she didn’t want to be. If anything, she wants her dress to scream “why don’t you want me” right to Agatha’s face. </span></p><p><span>By the head turns she gets from a few men as she walks in, and one sneer from a wife, it might be working. </span></p><p><span>She weaves her way into the already crowded space and immediately beelines it for the bar. Better to face a night like this slightly tipsy. The bar is crowded with faces she doesn’t recognize and a few she’s seen roaming the hospital hallways. She gives a few courtesy nods but avoids talking to anyone. After paying for a drink (it’s not even an open bar), she starts searching for her table number. </span></p><p><span>She easily spots Jen where she is chatting nearby with Alice, her fingers hovering too closely to her lower back. Rio narrows her eyes at the pair. They are too happy, too carefree, even at a work event. It seems unfair. Jen catches the look and quickly drops her hand, forcing a bright smile as she waves her over. </span></p><p><span>Rio returns a tight-lipped smile in reply and gestures toward the tables, pretending she’s busy. </span></p><p><span>Her gaze drifts across the glittering crowd as if she’s simply taking in the spectacle. But there’s only one person she’s really looking for. </span></p><p><span>She scans the room once, trying hard to spot her unruly hair. Nothing.</span></p><p><span>She scans the faces again quickly, a slight panic flashing over her eyes. No sign of her. She swears she said she was going to be here. A small lump of disappointment settles low in her chest. </span></p><p><span>Instead, her eyes find the one person she wishes she hadn’t. </span></p><p><span>Evanora.</span></p><p><span>She stands near the front, flanked by a circle of men in dark suits who laugh too loudly at everything she says. Her power suit, although tailored, still appears a size too big for her small frame. Unfortunately, the bruise Rio left her has since faded. </span></p><p><span>Rio threads her way through the crowd, dodging a few greetings and a waiter balancing a tray of crab cakes. Another passes by with champagne and she snags two flutes without breaking her stride. </span></p><p><span>Evanora’s voice carries easily above the hum of conversation - Rio can hear her saying something about the hospital’s “record breaking quarter,” due to her "efficiency” and “budgeting.” The men chuckle obligingly as she jokes the nurses don’t seem to mind the pay cut, or the extra shifts. </span></p><p><span>Rio slips into the small circle beside her, fitting neatly into the empty space between Evanora and a red-face executive. She plasters on her best fake smile. </span></p><p><span>“You look like you could use a drink,” she says lightly, offering one of the glasses. Evanora takes it, her fingers curling around the stem. She smiles and turns to Rio, as soon as she sees her face, her lips curl - the smile faltering into a snarl. It lasts less than a second before the perfect mask is back. But Rio still notices.</span></p><p><span>“Evanora,” Rio greets smoothly, voice overly sweet. “Always a pleasure.” </span></p><p><span>“And you as well, doctor….” Evanora hesitates like her name escapes her. Rio is sure it’s an act. </span></p><p><span>“Rio Vidal,” she adds before turning to the small group. “Internal medicine.”</span></p><p><span>A few men nod. </span></p><p><span>“Oh how could I forget,” Evanora drawls, her voice dripping with practiced charm. “Dr. Vidal has been such an…asset to the hospital. </span><em><span>Especially </span></em><span>the residents.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s one way to put it,” Rio reacts with a small bite to her words. Her gaze drops to Evanora’s untouched champagne. Not one sip taken. She probably thinks she poisoned it. And maybe she should have. </span></p><p><span>Then an idea strikes her - a bit wicked, mostly opportunistic and too tempting to resist. </span></p><p><span>“Evanora, I’ve been meaning to speak with you actually,” she adds. </span></p><p><span>“Oh?” There is a hint of genuine curiosity in her voice, or maybe it’s suspicion. </span></p><p><span>“I have a patient in need of Blincyto that insurance denied.” Rio’s tone stays deceptively casual. “I know the hospital has a charitable fund for special cases and she would be a perfect recipient for it.” </span></p><p><span>Evanora’s eyes narrow, her brow furrowing for a fraction for a second. Then the falsity returns, a political smile plastered across her face. </span></p><p><span>“Of course, dear,” She says, placing her hand on Rio’s arm. “Why don’t you draft up a formal proposal for me and send it to my office? I’m sure we can work something out. Now if you will excuse me.” </span></p><p><span>Then she drifts away, ready to turn on her charm for the next group of donors waiting for her. </span></p><p><span>Rio stands there for a minute. Almost in shock. That was…surprisingly easy. Too easy. It feels like there is a catch, there has to be a catch; she just doesn’t know what it is yet. </span></p><p><span>Rio blinks the room back into focus. The music softens into something softer. A few executives begin migrating toward the stage - a clear signal they are about to begin. </span></p><p><span>Waiters glide between tables, balancing trays full of plates of bland salads. Rio slips into her seat just as a salad is placed in front of her. Her table is full of other attendings - Jen, Strange and a few others she’s only met in passing. Doesn’t matter, it still isn’t who she’s looking for. </span></p><p><span>She stabs at her lettuce with a fork, mostly for show rather than actually eating. As the first speaker starts to drone on, she smears some dressing across her plate. </span></p><p><span>Then, movement catches her eye. A figure slipping quietly through the side entrance. </span></p><p><span>It’s been 21 days since Rio last touched Agatha. Not that she’s counted. </span></p><p><span>And she looks sinful. </span></p><p><span>Her black dress dips low in the front, barely covering the sides of her breasts. Her hair is down, cascading to her waist in polished curls. </span></p><p><span>Rio tries not to watch her. But she can’t help it, when Agatha walks through the room people take notice. Not just because she’s the daughter of an executive, but because of the way she carries herself. </span></p><p><span>She looks like the world was made to orbit her. And maybe it was. </span></p><p><span>What is it the kids call it now? </span><em><span>Main character energy </span></em></p><p><span>And of course, trailing behind her comes Ralph. His suit looks like it came from the department store clearance rack, his hair haphazardly brushed to one side. The two of them sink into seats at Evanora’s table and Rio watches her flash a smile between the pair. </span></p><p><span>Rio forces herself to look away. She focuses on the silverware before her, the condensation slipping down her water glass, the stale bread in the center of the table - anything but her. </span></p><p><span>But still, she risks another glance toward the main table, only to find Agatha is already looking. </span></p><p><span>The sight hits her like a physical blow. Like her chest is caving in. Across the sea of faces, their eyes meet. </span></p><p><span>Agatha’s face is maddenly composed, her eyes softening, icy blue meeting amber brown. Almost a month of not touching her collapses into a single second. Rio feels it in her chest, hot and low. Like she’s being swept out to sea in a rip current. What’s the survival tactic? Stay calm as it carries her out to sea. It feels right. Letting herself drown in Agatha’s eyes. </span></p><p><span>Agatha tilts her head, ever so slightly, her dark waves falling over her shoulder. </span></p><p><span>Rio’s lips part before she catches herself. She flicks her tongue out to coat her bottom lip without thinking. Agatha’s nostrils flare, her eyes darkening as she watches her. </span></p><p><span>Just like that, the whole gala feels smaller. The air tighter. </span></p><p><span>Agatha looks away first, turning toward Ralph as if he’s said something worth hearing. </span></p><p><span>Rio exhales, letting out a tight breath. God help her. Twenty-one days and she’s still addicted. </span></p><p><span>At that moment, Evanora rises from her table. She smooths the front of her suit, even though there isn’t a wrinkle on it, and starts toward the stage. </span></p><p><span>Rio considers leaving. She could slip out now, disappear before she’s forced to sit through 30 plus minutes of whatever self-congratulatory speech Evanora is about to unleash. But standing up as the entire crowd is seated, now digging into the dry chicken of their main course, might be a little too obvious. </span></p><p><span>Plus she hasn’t even spoken two words to Agatha and that was, after all, the only reason she even cared to be here. </span></p><p><span>Evanora takes the stage, straightening her note cards. Her voice spills into the microphone, oozing with fake honey and performative grace. She thanks the board, the donors, and the “community that makes miracles happen.” Rio watches the audience lap it up, clinking their glasses and laughing at all the right moments. </span></p><p><span>“Of course,” she smiles like a politician, “none of this would be possible without the exceptional work of our residency programs - emergency medicine, neurology, general surgery and of course, internal medicine.” </span></p><p><span>Her eyes land on Agatha. “A true testament to our program is my daughter, Agatha. Isn’t she glowing? Only a few short months from being a bride.” </span></p><p><span>The crowd turns in unison. To an outsider, it might look like a genuine heartfelt moment, a compliment from a mother to daughter.  But it’s not a gesture of kindness or an olive branch - it’s a warning: </span><em><span>I control you. </span></em></p><p><span>Rio sees Agatha’s fingers tighten on the edge of her chair, nails digging crescents into the fabric. </span></p><p><span>A second passes, too long, before Agatha stands. She gives a practiced smile, the kind that’s been drilled into her since childhood. Then a wave. The picture of composure. </span></p><p><span>But Evanora isn’t done. </span></p><p><span>“Darling,” she says lightly, extending her hand toward her, “why don’t you say a few words?” </span></p><p><span>It isn’t a request. </span></p><p><span>Agatha’s hand curls into a small fist at her side, but her forced smile never wavers. She pushes her chair back further to slide out from the table, walking toward the front. </span></p><p><span>Rio is sure this isn’t planned. It’s a move from Evanora. A trap disguised as charm. </span></p><p><span>She steps up to the microphone. The stage lights illuminate her face, bouncing off the caramel highlights of her hair. </span></p><p><span>She clears her throat then pauses, letting the silence wash over the room until it becomes slightly uncomfortable. Someone in the back of the room coughs, another scrapes a knife across their plate as they cut into their meal. It’s Agatha taking back an ounce of control - making everyone squirm. </span></p><p><span>“Thank you,” she says finally, voice even but hollow. “It’s an honor to be part of a hospital that…” she stops, turning to Evanora, “that values compassion and honesty. Especially from its leadership. They are, after all, the picture of integrity.” </span></p><p><span>She spits out the last words with sarcasm, her eyes fixed on Evanora. </span></p><p><span>“And the attendings,” her eyes drift to Rio. “I appreciate how </span><em><span>hands on</span></em><span> they are. They can be so generous and giving. Even when we act a little bratty.” Her eyes twinkle as she smiles slowly, knowingly. </span></p><p><span>Rio can feel a few eyes turn to her. Watching every expression, every blink as Agatha speaks. Her cheeks flush slightly and she grabs at her water goblet, taking huge gulps to try to smother out the fire igniting within her. </span></p><p><span>“You can really feel the passion they have…” she pauses. “For their work.” She finally adds with a smirk. </span></p><p><span>A few tense chuckles litter the crowd. Others whisper among themselves, questioning if they heard Agatha correctly. </span></p><p><span>Without another word, Agatha steps off the stage. But she doesn’t return to her seat. Her strides are calm and measured as she makes her way toward the edge of the room, and then out the door. </span></p><p><span>Ralph is left sitting there alone, looking around a bit confused at what just happened. </span></p><p><span>Evanora snarls, her lips curling as she watches Agatha leave but she says nothing. She turns again to the microphone, introducing the next speaker as if nothing happened. </span></p><p><span>Rio stands immediately, beelining her way toward the exit. But she’s much further back than Agatha, and as she’s walking, she sees Evanora head off the stage, turning to follow in the direction Agatha went. </span></p><p><span>Their paths cross just as they reach the side door. </span></p><p><span>Evanora steps in front of her, like she’s blocking the path for Rio to get to Agatha. </span></p><p><span>“You know,” Evanora snarls. “I have to thank you. Whatever you did, made Agatha finally run back to me. Guess she finally realized what was good for her.” </span></p><p><span>Then she opens the door, slides out and lets in slam in Rio’s face. </span></p><p><span>But Rio isn’t going to let this one go. She waits a beat then opens the door quietly, following the faint sound of Evanora’s footsteps against the marble.</span></p><p><span>Just before she rounds the corner, she hears their voices. She flattens her back against the wall, listening from the shadows.</span></p><p><span>“I’m doing what you asked, Mother,” Agatha spits. “I’m smiling. I’m laughing. I’m pretending to enjoy being with Ralph even though touching him makes my skin crawl.” </span></p><p><span>“Good,” Evanora purrs, her words filled with venom. </span></p><p><span>“Now will you leave me alone? Leave Rio alone?”</span></p><p><span>“Oh honey.” The mock sweetness in Evanora’s tone curdles instantly. “You think ten minutes of sucking up is enough to erase years of disappointment? You will walk down the aisle, Agatha. Even if it kills me, I will make sure you do.”</span></p><p><span>“I’ve already told you that isn’t going to happen.”</span></p><p><span>“And where did that defiance get you?” Evanora spits back. “One day you’ll grow out of this rebellious stage like some teenager. God knows what that attending put in your head. I can’t imagine what you did with her - actually don’t tell me. But it’s all over now. She’s not allowed to teach you anymore - and soon you’ll see that Mother knows best. Marry a nice boy. Climb the ladder. That’s where the power is.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha doesn’t say anything, but Rio swears she can hear a small sob escape her. </span></p><p><span>“You’re lucky to have me,” Evanora continues, her tone icy now. “I found you Ralph. Because God knows no one else would marry someone as wicked as you.” </span></p><p><span>“You’re wrong,” Agatha says, her voice starting to tremble. “There are people who want me.” </span></p><p><span>“Are you sure?” Evanora snarls. “Where are they now? Did they leave you like everyone else? Because that’s what happens while people find out what a bad girl you really are. They don’t stick around.” </span></p><p><em><span>I do. </span></em><span>Rio thinks. </span><em><span>I’m still here even when she pushed me away.</span></em></p><p><span>With that, Rio hears footsteps start fading down the hall - but it’s one set only. </span></p><p><span>Rio peers around the corner. Agatha stands alone, her back to the wall, shoulders trembling slightly as she drags in a ragged breath. </span></p><p><span>For a moment, Rio hesitates. She tells herself to walk away - to give Agatha the space she asked for. Let her deal with this the way she seems to want to - alone. </span></p><p><span>But then Agatha wipes her nose with the back of her hand and something in Rio breaks. </span></p><p><em><span>Fuck it.</span></em></p><p><span>She steps around the corner. “Agatha.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha startles, wiping her eyes quickly before her expression turning more cold, walls flying back up. “You shouldn’t be here.” </span></p><p><span>“Yeah, well,” Rio says, softly as she steps closer. “Too bad. Because here I am.” </span></p><p><span>She keeps walking until she is nearly face to face with her. She’s so close, she can feel Agatha’s warm breath on her face. She can see the red rimming her eyes, the flush of her cheeks, the curve of her lips. </span></p><p><span>Agatha tilts her head as she closes in. </span></p><p><span>“Tell me to leave,” Rio breathes into the space between them. </span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes flutter closed. </span></p><p><span>Rio doesn’t think anymore. She just crashes her lips into Agatha’s, pushing them both backward until Agatha’s head hits the wall with a loud thud. Her hands find Agatha’s waist, dragging her closer until the space between them is gone. Rio’s hand fists the fabric of Agatha’s dress at her waist. One hand slides up her sides, over her ribs, brushing along the curve of her breast. Her thumb and forefinger find her nipple, twisting and pinching slightly. </span></p><p><span>She’s consuming her. Swallowing her whole. Her tongue invades every aspect of her mouth. The kiss is wild, consuming. She wants to mark her, to erase every trace of anyone else until all that’s left is this. </span></p><p><span>She half-expects Agatha to shove her away, to yell, to do something. </span></p><p><span>But she doesn’t. </span></p><p><span>Her lips comply, molding into Rio’s as her tongue slips into her mouth. She answers the hunger right back. Rio can hear her moan into her, her pelvis pressing forward, seeking comfort. </span></p><p><span>Rio’s thigh parts Agatha’s legs, slotting up between them. Rio fists her hands into the sides of Agatha’s dress, yanking it up slightly to give her a better angle. </span></p><p><span>She pulls her own dress up, granting access to the bare skin of her leg. Agatha doesn’t hesitate to sink down onto her, grinding slightly. Her bare cunt hits the skin of Rio’s thigh, the slick sliding along her. </span></p><p><span>“You’re not wearing underwear,” Rio growls. “Are you that desperate for me?”</span></p><p><span>“It wasn’t for you.” Agatha breaths, her mouth along Rio’s throat.</span></p><p><span>“Sure it wasn’t.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha throws her head back, letting it land on the wall behind her. She rolls her hips forward, thrusting against Rio’s thigh. </span></p><p><span>“Just like that, baby,” Rio purrs into her ear. “God I’ve missed this.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha moans as Rio’s hands slip under the hem of her dress, her fingers digging into her hip bones. Agatha’s hips become more erratic, driving forward as she gets closer to the edge. </span></p><p><span>Rio feels the hot, wet arousal seeping out of Agatha. She swears it’s running down her thigh, to her knee. Her fingers slide from Agatha’s hip down to the apex of her legs, finding her clit easily and applying pressure. </span></p><p><span>“Fuck. I’m close,” rips from Agatha’s throat, her voice rough with arousal. Her fingers grip hard into Rio’s shoulders, anchoring herself to ride her. She starts trembling as she shatters for her. Her face buries into Rio’s neck, her body jerking under Rio’s touch. </span></p><p><span>“Oh my god,” Rio hears a voice behind her. A male voice. </span></p><p><span>Agatha tenses against Rio; the high crashing instantly into discomfort. </span></p><p><span>Rio’s thigh drops, her legs coming to either side of Agatha to shield her. Agatha jerks her dress down to cover her thighs. </span></p><p><span>“Fuck,” Agatha mutters again, but this time it’s filled with guilt. And anger. She drops her head slightly. </span></p><p><span>Rio still stands in front of her to shield her, but Agatha slides out from behind her instead. </span></p><p><span>“Ralph, this isn’t what it looks like.”</span></p><p><span>“You…you won’t even kiss me,” he stammers, disbelief edging his voice. “I thought you were saving yourself for marriage?”</span></p><p><span>At that, Rio can’t help it. She bursts out laughing. Agatha swats her arm hard. “Stop it!”</span></p><p><span>Rio bites back another laugh. “Sorry,” she smiles. “It’s just…wow. That’s what you told him?” </span></p><p><span>Agatha glares. “It’s not funny,” she hisses.</span></p><p><span>Rio looks back at Ralph, still grinning. “Okay, look. How much can I pay you? Name your price.” </span></p><p><span>“Excuse me?” He tilts his head. </span></p><p><span>“I’ll pay you off,” Rio explains. “Not to tell her mother. Or anyone for that matter.”</span></p><p><span>“If you think you can…”</span></p><p><span>“Ten thousand enough?”</span></p><p><span>“Rio!” Agatha warns. </span></p><p><span>“Oh you know what!” Rio claps her hands together. “You should definitely break off the wedding, Ralph. With the infidelity and all!” She looks between them proudly, like she’s come up with some genius plan.</span></p><p><span>“Ralph,” Agatha’s voice drips like honey, but full of bullshit. “Go back to the table. I’ll come find you.”</span></p><p><span>His face looks dejected. If Rio didn’t totally hate the guy, she might actually feel bad for him. </span></p><p><span>He backs away slowly, eyes never leaving the pair until he starts to round the corner of the hallway. Then he turns, tripping over himself and practically running away. </span></p><p><span>“Well that went well,” Rio chuckles. “Now where were we?” </span></p><p><span>She reaches forward to Agatha, arms circling around her neck. She tilts her head, ready to kiss her again. </span></p><p><span>But the blue eyes that look back up to her are full of regret. </span></p><p><span>“Agatha,” Rio starts. “Before you say anything…”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes find the floor, refusing to meet Rio’s. “This didn’t mean anything. It can’t. You are just easy to want. That’s all.” </span></p><p><span>The words slice clean through her. </span></p><p><span>“You aren’t seriously picking that meat bag over me?” </span></p><p><span>“It’s…it’s not like that.” Agatha sucks in a breath. “Everytime we are together, it’s chaos. Like everything goes wrong. I’m just waiting for the damn kitchen sink to get hurled at me next.” </span></p><p><span>“You sure seem to thrive on the chaos,” Rio bites back, stepping away from her to put some distance between their bodies. </span></p><p><span>“What is that supposed to mean?”</span></p><p><span>“You can put a stop to half of it.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shakes her head as Rio talks. Like she doesn’t believe her. </span></p><p><span>“We can’t keep doing this.” Agatha looks up then, her eyes rimmed but still fierce. “I want you to stop pursuing me.”</span></p><p><span>The words feel like Rio just stepped on a landmine. Unexpected, buried in the dirt where no one saw it coming. </span></p><p><span>“I’m not pursuing you,” Rio says quietly. “I’m trying to be here for you.” </span></p><p><span>“I want you to stop making my life hell,” Agatha finishes, as if she needs to hurt her before she can be hurt again. And there it is, the toxic pain Natasha warned her about. </span></p><p><span>Rio should be logical about this. She should let her vent and not argue back with her. But even as she thinks about it, she feels her blood pressure rise, the words coming out before she can stop them. </span></p><p><span>“You think this is my fault?” Rio’s voice starts raising. “Your mother? Ralph? That’s all because of me?”</span></p><p><span>“I was fine before I met you!” </span></p><p><span>“You pursued me!”</span></p><p><span>“And clearly that was a mistake. This ends tonight,” Agatha says, her words trembling. </span></p><p><span>Rio swallows, the sting settling deep in her chest. “Then at least say it like you mean it,” she bites back. “Maybe when your fucking cum isn’t drying on my leg.” </span></p><p><span>Rio doesn’t wait for a reply. She just turns and walks away. </span></p><p><span>—</span></p>

<p> </p><p><span>The hospital is far too festive. Christmas trees line the lobby, nurses wear Santa hats and the cafeteria is serving sugar cookies. </span></p><p><span>No one should be that cheerful working Christmas at a hospital. </span></p><p><span>Rio isn’t. </span></p><p><span>Even though she volunteered for the shift, she still hates being in the hospital on Christmas. Nothing screams “Grinch” quite like telling a patient they don’t get to go home for Christmas - or worse, telling your favorite cancer patient she’s running out of time.  </span></p><p><span>“Your white blood cell count is basically non-existent,” Rio explains, scanning the computer in front of her. </span></p><p><span>Chloe’s eyes flicker up. “Meaning?” </span></p><p><span>“You can’t have visitors for Christmas,” Rio explains gently. “You have nearly no immune system.” </span></p><p><span>Chloe has been Rio’s patient now for over two months now. Long enough that her hospital room feels lived in - slippers under the bed, family pictures taped to the wall and a plastic Christmas tree on the windowsill. Despite every round of treatment, every adjustment, every ounce of hope Rio tries to feed her, Chloe keeps slipping further away. </span></p><p><span>“What about Frank?” Chloe asks softly. “Please…just allow my husband at least.”</span></p><p><span>Rio hesitates. The rule is clear. But rules are easier to follow when the person asking isn’t looking at you like that - eyes hollow with dark circles, face pale, a slight sadness over her expression. </span></p><p><span>“Frank’s healthy, I promise,” Chloe continues. “He’ll wear a mask. He just promised he wouldn’t let me spend Christmas alone.” </span></p><p><span>Rio exhales, biting her lip. “Fine. But he has to wear all the neutropenic precautions gear - mask, gown and gloves. Understood?” </span></p><p><span>Chloe’s thin cheeks crease into a smile. “Understood. Thank you, Dr. Vidal.” </span></p><p><span>Chloe picks up her phone, already dialing before Rio turns to leave. “She says you can come,” she says excitedly. “Bring me that chocolate cake I like too. I don’t care if I throw it up, it’s worth it today.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s hand is already on the door when Chloe calls after her. “He says ‘God bless you.’” </span></p><p><span>Rio smiles. For a second, she doesn’t feel like a Grinch. </span></p><p><span>Chloe pulls the phone away from her ear, clicking on the screen to activate the speaker phone.</span></p><p><span>“He wants to talk to you,” she gestures at the screen.</span></p><p><span>“Dr. Vidal!” His voice comes through cheerfully. “Thank you again.”</span></p><p><span>“Of course.”</span></p><p><span>“But I wanted to ask,” Rio can sense the change in his tone, becoming more serious and concerned. “Where are we with the new chemo? I thought you were working on getting the hospital to pay for it.”</span></p><p><span>Rio sighs. Truth be told, she’s gotten nowhere. Every email, every request to the CEO has gone unanswered. Not that she should be surprised. But it’s Christmas, not the time to throw out more bad news unless absolutely necessary. </span></p><p><span>“It’s a work in progress,” she lies. “We will know more after the holidays. I’m sure of it.”  </span></p><p><span>Rio smiles and gives a small nod, her throat tightening as she steps out into the hallway. </span></p><p><span>Out in the hall, she pulls her phone from her white coat pocket, scanning through her inbox. She’s sent Evanora three separate requests for Blincyto - each one unanswered. She refreshes the page anyway, as if the right subject line might suddenly appear. </span></p><p><span>It doesn’t. </span></p><p><span>She refreshes the page again as she walks, and slams into the back of someone. </span></p><p><span>Instantly her nostrils are filled with the familiar scent of sandalwood and vanilla. </span></p><p><span>She almost doesn’t want to look up. She doesn’t want to face her. Not today. </span></p><p><span>“What are you doing here?” She hears Agatha’s voice cut through the static in her brain. She focuses on the ugly linoleum tile beneath her sneakers. </span></p><p><span>“My job.” </span></p><p><span>“You are working on Christmas?”</span></p><p><span>“So are you.”</span></p><p><span>“I wanted to avoid my mother.”</span></p><p><span>“My cancer patient is getting worse. I wanted to be here for her.”</span></p><p><span>They speak at the same time - two excuses tumbling over each other. Rio wants to scream that she was hoping to run into Agatha. Even seeing her, like that, at work, the air between them tense, still seems worth it. It’s better to be hated in her presence than not around her at all. </span></p><p><span>Rio keeps her eyes fixed on the floor but she can feel Agatha watching her. Her gaze is sharp and assessing, studying her. </span></p><p><span>“You look tired,” Agatha says finally. Her tone is bitter, but when Rio looks up to meet her eyes, they look unexpectedly tender. </span></p><p><span>“Thanks for saying I look like hell.” Rio huffs. </span></p><p><span>Agatha’s mouth curves. “I was trying to be polite.”</span></p><p><span>Rio wants to say it back, to say she can tell it’s been rough on Agatha too, but the image before her screams the opposite. </span></p><p><span>Her hair is pulled back neatly, white coat unwrinkled. She’s wearing a dark red lipstick. A Christmas light necklace is around her neck, cheap and plastically, like something she stole from a nurses’ station.</span></p><p><span>Agatha meets her eyes and for the first time it doesn’t feel electrically charged. It doesn’t feel like sexual tension threatening to bubble to the surface. It feels like a sad memory. </span></p><p><span>Rio can’t take it anymore. She breaks the trace, choosing to pivot. “I know it’s a lot to ask, but has your mother said anything about Chloe’s Blincyto?” </span></p><p><span>“Who?”</span></p><p><span>“My cancer patient. I talked to her at the gala…”</span></p><p><span>Agatha cuts her off, her eyes wide. “You spoke to Evanora?”</span></p><p><span>“Yeah she was surprisingly nice about it. Said she would look into…” </span></p><p><span>Agatha butts her in again, her words sharp. “You shouldn’t be chasing that chemo approval. You know she made her decision before you even finished your sentence.” </span></p><p><span>“I figured,” Rio says, disappointed. </span></p><p><span>“You never know when to stop,” Agatha murmurs.</span></p><p><span>Rio’s pulse spikes. “You say that like it’s a bad thing.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha steps closer, but not enough to touch her. But enough that the scent of her fills the air, the warmth radiating off her skin. “Sometimes it is, Rio,” she leans forward, the words falling into the tight space between them. </span></p><p><span>Rio wants to raise her hand to reach out to her. To touch her skin, even if it’s just for a minute. </span></p><p><span>Despite every warning that this thing between them is over, every time Agatha walks into her personal space, she wants to devour her. </span></p><p><span>A part of her wonders if it will always be like this. If her body will always ache to feel her. </span></p><p><span>Agatha straightens, her composure snapping back into place. “Merry Christmas, Dr. Vidal.”</span></p><p><span>“Merry Christmas Agatha.”</span></p><p><span>—</span></p><p><span>Agatha wants to drown herself in liquor. It seems like the logical choice at the moment - the most efficient way to silence the noise in her head. </span></p><p><span>Agatha somehow found the only club open in the city on Christmas day. As a result, it’s packed - College kids who haven’t gone home for holidays, a few regulars hunched over drinks, lonely singles and divorced dads flood the bar. </span></p><p><span>A grumpy bartender has thrown on a well worn Christmas hat. The club is dimly light, a small disco ball lights up a dance floor, a local DJ is positioned in the corner. Cheap Christmas lights are tacked up along the walls with scotch tape, half of which are already sagging. </span></p><p><span>Agatha orders tequila shots for the entire group - Billy, Alice, and herself. She’s thrown on black leather pants - ones she bought at a sample sale and only brings out for special occasions. She paired it with a sheer red, lace corset top and too-high of heels. </span></p><p><span>“Agatha,” Billy warns, watching the server line them up. “When I said we should go out for drinks, I didn’t think it meant we were going this hard.”</span></p><p><span>“I’ll take yours then.” She doesn’t wait for an answer. She lifts the clear liquid to her lips, swallowing it in one large gulp. Then she reaches her own, knocks that one back that too and bites into the lime.</span></p><p><span>“That bad, huh?” Alice asks, a mix of sympathy and curiosity. </span></p><p><span>Agatha waves the bartender over. “Another round.” </span></p><p><span>Billy exchanges a look with Alice, but neither says anything. </span></p><p><span>“Jesus, Agatha,” Billy mutters, “are we celebrating or grieving?”</span></p><p><span>“Little of both,” she says, forcing a smirk that doesn’t reach her eyes.</span></p><p><span>When the next shots arrive, she takes one, but her hand isn’t as steady this time. The rim of the glass clinks against her teeth. </span></p><p><span>“Alright, spill it,” Billy presses gently. “Is this because Jen made you come in on Christmas?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shakes her head. “As fucking annoying as she is,” she shoots Alice a look. “I volunteered.” </span></p><p><span>Alice blinks. “Oh my god, why?” </span></p><p><span>“Wanted to see her.” They both know she isn’t talking about Jen. </span></p><p><span>Billy groans. “You are being stupid, you know that right? Actually both of you are. You obviously love each other, why can’t you just buck up and tell her? Move on from whatever this dance is you are doing.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha laughs, but it’s empty and humorless. “I can’t. I can’t be with her. As long as my mother is still alive, this thing between us doesn’t stand a chance. And Rio…” her finger starts picking at the worn wood of the bar table like saying her name is even too much for her. “She doesn’t do half-measures. She dives in headfirst. It was like getting swept up in a flash flood. I couldn’t breathe. Do I look like a u-hauling kind of lesbian to you?” </span></p><p><span>“Yes.”</span></p><p><span>“Yes.”</span></p><p><span>Billy and Alice offer at the same time. </span></p><p><span>“Do we need to kill her then?” Alice asks.</span></p><p><span>“Rio?” Agatha looks at her sideways, shocked. </span></p><p><span>Alice chuckles. “Your mother.” </span></p><p><span>Somewhere in a dark corner of her mind, Agatha considers it. </span></p><p><span>“By the way,” Billy smirks, reaching for the last shot and sliding it out of Agatha’s reach. “You didn’t deny when I said you love her.”</span></p><p><span>“Yes I did,” Agatha shoots back, a little too quickly.  </span></p><p><span>Billy and Alice just stare at her with looks full of pity. </span></p><p><span>Despite every moment Agatha has tried to push her away, Rio is still there for her when she needs her the most. She keeps coming back. Like a good man in a storm. Agatha can see Rio’s face in her mind - the stubborn set of her jaw, the warmth of her eyes, the way she always looks at Agatha like she is something worth believing in.</span></p><p><span>“So what now?” She looks between the pair. </span></p><p><span>“You’ve got to tell her,” Billy insists. </span></p><p><span>Alice nods. “Before she gives up on waiting.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha waves them off and reaches for Billy’s shot again, but he’s faster. He grabs the glass and throws it back with a grimace. Agatha scowls at him. “Sure, I’ll just pencil that in between my cake tasting and menu planning,” she says sarcastically. </span></p><p><span>“Oh my god, look,” Billy grabs her cell phone from the table, waving it around dramatically. “It’s almost like you could just call her right now.” </span></p><p><span>“On Christmas?” </span></p><p><span>“No time like the present!” </span></p><p><span>“Fine.” She yanks the phone from his hand then climbs down the bar stool. She’s lucky she’s got a few shots in her, fueling her on. </span></p><p><span>Billy rests his chin on his hands, grinning like a child, waiting. </span></p><p><span>Agatha shoots him a look. “I’m not doing this here,” she says, rolling her eyes. </span></p><p><span>As she walks away, Agatha has no idea if she is actually going to do this. She could just lie to them. Say Rio didn’t answer. Or tell them they are on good terms now. The latter of which won’t work out so well when they notice Rio still won’t talk to her. </span></p><p><span>Truth be told, Agatha doesn’t know what she wants to hear on the other side of that line. She knows she wants to hear her voice. To know she hasn’t lost her completely, even after all the insults she threw at her. Even after asking her to leave her alone. To know that if she wanted - Rio would still be hers - and she would…right?</span></p><p><span>It’s that curiosity (or maybe masochism) that drives Agatha to find a back hallway, the one leading toward the bathrooms. She plants her back against the wall and unlocks her phone. Her thumb has to scroll too far through her recent calls to find Rio’s number. </span></p><p><span>She can barely hear the other line over the noise of the music of the bar - bad christmas music mixed with an obnoxious amount of chatter. Plus the swimming in her brain from the multiple tequila shots doesn’t help. </span></p><p><span>She presses call. </span></p><p><span>The line rings once. Twice. </span></p><p><span>She hears someone pick up but doesn’t hear a hello.</span></p><p><span>Instead, she hears the faint jumble of voices and laughter in the background. </span></p><p><span>“Hello?” Agatha says into the speaker. </span></p><p><span>No response. </span></p><p><span>“Rio?” she tries again, yelling louder into the speaker. “Can you hear me?” </span></p><p><span>She pulls the phone from her ear to check the screen. It’s Rio’s number, no mistake there. She presses the phone back to her ear but only hears mumbled voices - the noise of the bar too loud. She sinks further back into the hallway, the music fading and tries to make out what the conversation on the other end is saying. </span></p><p><span>A woman’s voice. Not Rio’s. Then a soft giggle.  </span></p><p><span>“Who knew you were so funny,” the woman says, her tone light and teasing. </span></p><p><span>Agatha’s stomach drops. She holds her breath as if it is going to help her hear better. </span></p><p><span>“Hey babe?” the voice calls again, muffled now, as if turned toward someone else. </span></p><p><span>She hears Rio murmuring in response, but she can’t make out the words. </span></p><p><span>Suddenly the voice is much closer, almost next to the phone. “Looks like your phone butt dialed someone.” </span></p><p><span>More incoherent words. </span></p><p><span>“Hello?” comes the female voice through the line. It’s soft, sultry like butter. And far too cheerful. “Sorry,” comes a laugh, “Rio is </span><em><span>unavailable </span></em><span>right now.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha says nothing. </span></p><p><span>“Are you there?” Another giggle. “I can hear you breathing.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha covers her mouth, swallowing hard. She doesn’t dare move a muscle. She just listens. </span></p><p><span>“I don’t know,” the woman says in the background. “It said ‘Agatha.’” </span></p><p><span>Then the line goes dead. </span></p><p><span>Agatha freezes. The phone still pressed to her ear, hand covering her mouth. Her pulse is racing so loudly she can hear it in her ears. </span></p><p><span>She glances down at her phone screen like it might light up again. Like Rio might call her back and explain. </span></p><p><span>But her phone stays dark. </span></p><p><span>The ache starts immediately in her chest, blooming outwards until it’s slithering down her arms to her fingertips where they tighten around her phone. She slides down the wall until she’s sitting on the dirty bar floor, legs curled up to her chest. </span></p><p><span>She should move. She should stand up. The floor is filthy, covered in years of grime and spilled beer.</span></p><p><span>Maybe this is what she deserves. </span></p><p><span>For getting involved with an attending. For thinking she could rewrite the outcome of her carefully planned life. For pushing Rio away every single time she tried to get close. </span></p><p><span>Agatha tips her head back against the wall and stares up at the ceiling. At least that motion keeps the tears from spilling, holding them where they burn most, behind her eyes.</span></p><p><span>She isn’t sure how long she sits there like that. Eventually Billy comes to find her, his eyes darting around the hallway until they land on her. </span></p><p><span>“Oh girl,” He stands above her with his hands on his hips. “Tell me you are not sitting on a bar floor.” </span></p><p><span>“I’m not sitting on a bar floor.”</span></p><p><span>“You are,” he says flatly. “And it’s disgusting.” He reaches his hand out to help her up, grimacing. “I take it things didn’t go well?” </span></p><p><span>Agatha lets him pull her to her feet. “She’s not alone,” she says dryly. Billy wipes his hands on his pants, like Agatha is now as dirty as the floor beneath her. </span></p><p><span>“That could mean anything,” Billy tries to reassure her as he leads her back to the table. “It’s Christmas, maybe she’s having a family dinner.” </span></p><p><span>“With another woman? Just the two of them?” Agatha lifts an eyebrow. </span></p><p><span>Alice, already watching from their table, visibly cringes. </span></p><p><span>Billy looks sad for her. “Oh,” he mutters. “Well in that case,” he starts flagging down the bartender. “Another round.” </span></p><p><span>—</span></p><p><span>And old fashioned.</span></p><p><span>A manhattan.</span></p><p><span>A vodka tonic.</span></p><p><span>Lemon drop shots. </span></p><p><span>Agatha orders it all. Drink after drink hits her lips, each other blurring the edges a little more. None take away the ache Rio has left behind. </span></p><p><span>Twice Billy tries to stop her. And once Alice does, although her attempt barely counts - After a minute, she gives up, muttering about not wanting to play babysitter on Christmas. She leaves just Billy and Agatha at the bar. </span></p><p><span>“You know what we should do?” Agatha slurs, swaying slightly on her stool. </span></p><p><span>“Go home?” Billy suggests. “Sleep it off?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha groans. “Noooooo. Body shots!” </span></p><p><span>Billy exhales loudly. “I know you are sad and everything. But you aren’t really my type, sweetie.” He’s clearly annoyed. Agatha can feel it. But she doesn’t care. </span></p><p><span>“Party pooper,” Agatha gives a fake pout. “I wasn’t talking about you anyway.” She grabs his hand and tugs him toward the small dance floor where the strobe lights now flash. They weave in between the bodies, pulsing, sweating, grinding with the music. </span></p><p><span>She throws her hands back over her head, feeling the music and booze coursing through her veins. With every breath, every flash of the lights, she sees Rio in her mind. </span></p><p><span>Sitting on the couch with some faceless woman. Her hand on her leg. Her hands in her hair. Leaning toward her. Her face coming closer to her lips. </span></p><p><span>She slams her eyes shut. </span></p><p><span>When she opens them again, she scans the dance floor - a few women dancing with boyfriends, some standing at the edge of the dance floor.</span></p><p><span>Then she spots her. Red head, slightly shorter than her, her eyeliner thick against her green eyes. </span></p><p><span>Her thumbs are hooked into her jean pockets, a beer bottle hanging precariously between her fingers. She makes eye contact with Agatha, bringing the bottle slowly to her lips as she watches her. </span></p><p><span>Bingo.</span></p><p><span>Agatha tries to walk toward her, her heels suddenly too high where the dance floor transitions to the wood floor of the bar. She stumbles slightly, reaching out to catch herself. But the woman steps forward, arms coming up under Agatha’s to steady her. </span></p><p><span>The grip is firm across Agatha’s back as she stands up.</span></p><p><span>“You okay there, dizzy girl?” The woman muses, a slight laughter to her tone.</span></p><p><span>“Better now,” Agatha sways slightly, but lets herself be held. “Or maybe I just like falling for strangers.”</span></p><p><span>The redhead laughs, “Oh my, that was cheesy.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha leans forward toward her. She smells like cheap vanilla perfume and drugstore shampoo. Doesn’t matter. Another drink will mute the smell enough, just for one night. </span></p><p><span>“But it still worked,” Agatha’s confidence oozes through, even in her drunken state. </span></p><p><span>“That it did,” the redhead purrs. “What’s your name?”</span></p><p><span>“Doesn’t matter,” Agatha says, words slurring slightly. She looks away from her, not quite meeting her eyes. </span></p><p><span>“I’m…”</span></p><p><span>“Doesn’t matter,” Agatha cuts her off. “You want to do this or not?” </span></p><p><span>“That depends,” the woman says, fingers now wrapping around Agatha’s arms, pressing inward. “What did you have in mind?” </span></p><p><span>Agatha laughs, a sound that’s too loud, too hollow. “Slow down there, tiger. Let’s go to the bar.” </span></p><p><span>The woman frowns slightly. ”That’s it? Just going to buy me a drink?” </span></p><p><span>Agatha nods toward the counter. “After you, superstar.” She teases. “I’ll make it worth your trouble.” She’s drunk enough that her judgement is foggy, bold enough that she doesn’t care. </span></p><p><span>Billy, somewhere across the room, groans audibly. “Oh, </span><em><span>hell</span></em><span>,” she hears him mutter, but she’s already moving to the corner of the bar. She climbs on top, laying down and pulling up her top. The bartender merely rolls his eyes, not willing to fight more drunken patrons at this hour. </span></p><p><span>The redhead follows, laughing as she slides between Agatha’s legs, lime in hand. She licks along her skin creating a line for the salt. Then pours a shot into her belly button.    </span></p><p><span>It’s messy. Some might see it as sexy. The woman’s mouth is warm against her stomach.</span></p><p><span>But Agatha feels nothing.</span></p><p><span>Her head tilts back, eyes fixed on the spinning lights above. She imagines Rio’s face instead - the way she looks when she’s annoyed, or when she laughs at something stupid Agatha says. For a brief, torturous second, she can almost smell her perfume over the tequila and smoke.</span></p><p><span>Then the woman’s voice cuts through the noise. “You okay?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinks down at her, swallowing hard. “Yeah,” she lies, voice rough. “Never better.”</span></p><p><span>Billy’s watching from the edge of the bar now, arms crossed, expression unreadable. He doesn’t stop her. He knows it wouldn’t matter.</span></p><p><span>Because Agatha isn’t trying to have fun. She’s trying to forget.</span></p><p><span>When she climbs down from the bar, the redhead is on her, caging her in against the worn wood. </span></p><p><span>When she kisses Agatha, it’s all wrong. Her lips feel too thin, too tentative. </span></p><p><span>Agatha isn’t melting into the arms of some stranger like she wanted to. She isn’t forgetting Rio. No, she’s standing here with the redhead’s tongue in her mouth, her hands gripping Agatha’s hips - and she’s comparing her. </span></p><p><span>“Bathroom? Or my place?” The stranger purrs, her fingers now tracing the lace pattern along Agatha’s stomach. </span></p><p><span>“Actually, I’m good,” Agatha plucks the woman’s fingers away from her stomach like she’s picking up a bug. “Thanks though.” She wipes her lips with the back of her hand, trying to erase any trace of the redhead. </span></p><p><span>She slithers out of her arms, stepping away from the bar. Then starts looking for Billy. </span></p><p><span>“Bitch,” she hears the woman growl behind her. </span></p><p><span>“Feel better?” Billy asks as she approaches him. </span></p><p><span>“No,” Agatha grunts. </span></p><p><span>Billy doesn’t say anything for a while but just leads her to a corner booth, tucked away from the main bar. She follows him without protest, shoulders sagging slightly - out of shame or exhaustion - she isn’t sure which. </span></p><p><span>She’s tempted to order another drink. To reach the point of blacking out until she can’t remember her own name. But Billy is sliding a glass of water in front of her and even though she rolls her eyes at him, she takes a sip. </span></p><p><span>Her head tips back until it’s resting against the wall. The crowd feels too loud now, the music too harsh. Billy folds his arms as he leans back, watching her. “You done trying to self destruct for the night?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha doesn’t remove her head from the wall, she just closes her eyes. “That obvious?” </span></p><p><span>“You’re sitting in a bar on Christmas letting strangers do shots off of you.”</span></p><p><span>“Hey, you’re here too!” Agatha shoots back.</span></p><p><span>“But I’m like an emotional support animal.” Billy laughs quietly. “And a medical alert dog. Someone has to make sure you don’t die.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha finally lifts her head, but only to roll her eyes at him. </span></p><p><span>“You really should call it a night.” He warns, his tone now more serious. </span></p><p><span>Agatha nods, but she doesn’t move. Her head rests back again, eyes closing to try to stop the spinning that is now building. “Just five more minutes,” she mutters. </span></p><p><span>“Fine,” Billy sighs. “But if you start crying, I’m dragging you out of here.”</span></p><p><span>“Moi?” Agatha fakes exacerbation. “Never.”</span></p><p><span>—</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s head is swimming. It is well past 2am now, the bar has since closed. </span></p><p><span>She lied to Billy. Outside the bar, the cold nipping at their skin, she ordered an Uber. As they waited for it, she promised she was heading straight to her mom’s house. But the address she plugged in was one she saved months ago - Rio’s.</span></p><p><span>Now as the Uber rounds another corner, Agatha glances down at her phone’s GPS. Five minutes until her arrival. She swallows hard, the saliva thick in her throat, the nausea settling into her stomach. She can keep it down. At least long enough to avoid the cleaning fee from vomiting in the car.  </span></p><p><span>Her stomach turns again. She tells herself it’s the copious amounts of alcohol - mixing tequila, vodka and whatever else she consumed in the last few hours and not the thought of what she’s about to do. Not the confrontation she hasn’t planned out. </span></p><p><span>Finally, the car stops in front of Rio’s house. She can see a few lights on and Rio’s car in the driveway. Plus another, one she doesn’t recognize.  </span></p><p><span>She opens the car door and practically tumbles out. The Uber lingers for only a second, long enough for her to close the door and step onto the sidewalk, before it rolls away and leaves her standing alone. </span></p><p><span>Agatha stands there for a long moment, swaying slightly. She stares at the house, seeing the warm light spill through the blinds. A shadow of someone crosses by the window. </span></p><p><span>Her throat tightens. The nausea surges again. She doubles over, clutching her stomach as she vomits onto the curb. The sound is raw, humiliating. When it’s done, she wipes her mouth with the back of her hand. </span></p><p><span>Her eyes fix on the window again, watching, waiting. Just as she builds up the courage to start walking toward the door, the light flickers off. </span></p><p><span>The house goes dark. </span></p><p><span>—</span></p><p> </p>

<p><br/><br/></p><p><span>Last time on CBAGG: </span></p><p><span>Agatha stands there for a long moment, swaying slightly. She stares at the house, seeing the warm light spill through the blinds. A shadow of someone crosses by the window. </span></p><p><span>Her throat tightens. The nausea surges again. She doubles over, clutching her stomach as she vomits onto the curb. The sound is raw, humiliating. When it’s done, she wipes her mouth with the back of her hand. </span></p><p><span>Her eyes fix on the window again, watching, waiting. Just as she builds up the courage to start walking toward the door, the light flickers off. </span></p><p><span>—</span></p><p><span>Agatha sighs, debating just turning around again and ordering another Uber. Her eyes flick up to Rio’s porch, the only light still illuminated at the house. </span></p><p><span>There is a man standing there.</span></p><p><span>He’s definitely there. Just standing. Watching her.</span></p><p><span>He’s got on some red jacket, dressed up for Christmas no doubt. He even has on a stupid Santa hat, although it’s a bit sideways. </span></p><p><span>Maybe he’s keeping watch while Rio’s inside, fucking her new girlfriend. </span></p><p><span>Agatha starts up the walkway, heels crunching through the thin crust of snow. Her fists ball at her sides, fury starting to rise within her. He doesn’t move as she gets closer. He just stares, silent and unbothered by her presence. </span></p><p><span>“Who the hell are you?” she calls, stomping up the steps. </span></p><p><span>He doesn’t reply, he just stares at her again with a ridiculous smile plastered on his face.</span></p><p><span>“Hey!” She shouts, getting closer now. “I’m talking to you.” Her voice slurs at the edges. </span></p><p><span>He only smiles at her. </span></p><p><span>Agatha marches right up to him, her nose centimeters from his. “God you are even uglier than Ralph.” She settles back on her heels. “He’s my fake fiancé. Wait…” she hiccups. “That’s not right.”</span></p><p><span>She has to think for a second, swaying as she does. “He’s a real fiancé. He might be trapped in this too. Or maybe he really likes me.”</span></p><p><span>A beat. </span></p><p><span>“Oh that’s going to make me vomit again.” She gags at her own words. </span></p><p><span>She’s met with silence.</span></p><p><span>“Fucking say something!” She screams. </span></p><p><span>He doesn’t. </span></p><p><span>So she shoves him. Hard. </span></p><p><span>He teeters sideways, then crashes backward with a hollow thud. </span></p><p><span>Agatha stumbles too, catching her leg on part of the patio couch and landing squarely on her ass along the cushions. </span></p><p><span>The front door flies open. “What the hell!” Rio stands there barefoot, wearing cream oversized sweatpants and a black long-sleeve top. Her eyes widen as she looks between the man on the floor and Agatha, plastered sideways on the couch. </span></p><p><span>“You’re welcome,” Agatha grins up at Rio.</span></p><p><span>“For breaking my decor?”</span></p><p><span>“I fought him,” Agatha gives a lopsided smile. “For you.”</span></p><p><span>“He’s plastic, Agatha.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinks, rubbing her eyes against the harsh light of the porch. The man comes more into focus now from his place on the floor. </span></p><p><span>A plastic Santa. </span></p><p><em><span>Shit.</span></em></p><p><span>“Sorry ‘bout that,” Agatha chuckles a bit. </span></p><p><span>“Jesus,” Rio moans, scrubbing the hand over her face. “Are you drunk? Again?”</span></p><p><span>She steps forward and offers her hand to pull Agatha up from the porch couch. </span></p><p><span>“You realize every time you show up on my porch, you are drunk? If I had a nickel…” Rio starts. </span></p><p><span>“Then you would have two nickels!” Agatha beams like she’s cracked some kind of code. </span></p><p><span>Rio sighs. “How much did you have to drink?” </span></p><p><span>Agatha starts counting on her fingers. “One, two…my fair share.” She shrugs. </span></p><p><span>Before Rio can respond, Agatha suddenly lurches toward the railing and vomits over the side. The sound of liquid splashing onto the ground can be heard.</span></p><p><span>“Let’s just get you inside,” Rio says calmly, holding her arm out to help her walk. </span></p><p><span>“Why are you so nice to me?” Agatha whines as she threads her arm through Rio’s. Then, she freezes in the doorway, gasping. “Oh my god. Wait.” Her voice drops to a dramatic stage whisper. “Won’t your girlfriend find out I’m here?”</span></p><p><span>“What?” Rio sounds genuinely confused, dropping her arm as they step inside. “The phone call,” she concludes on her own. </span></p><p><span>“Yeah. The phone call,” Agatha slurs, nodding. </span></p><p><span>“Sorry, you heard that.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stops. Her hand shoots out to grip the counter, steadying herself. Because even in her drunken state, she has a moment of clarity. Rio didn’t apologize for the phone call. She didn’t explain. She didn’t say she was sorry for what Agatha heard - only sorry that she heard it. </span></p><p><span>She feels the bile rising in her throat again. </span></p><p><span>She must have gone pale because suddenly Rio is at her side, thrusting a small trash can into her hands. </span></p><p><span>Agatha retches, dry heaving slightly, but no further liquid comes out. Instead she feels Rio’s warm hand is at her back, rubbing small circles. </span></p><p><span>“I’m fine,” Agatha hisses back, even as she clutches the trash can and staggers toward the couch. </span></p><p><span>Unceremoniously, she plops down, her legs dangling off the edge. </span></p><p><span>Agatha closes her eyes, waiting for the spinning to stop. Then she feels it, the warm hands again, this time at her ankles, undoing the buckles of her heels. Her shoes slide off and hee feet are gently lifted onto the couch. </span></p><p><span>She hears the shuffle of feet on the carpet and assumes Rio is leaving her alone to sleep it off. </span></p><p><span>“Zofran,” Rio says suddenly. Agatha isn’t sure if it’s been a minute or an hour. She opens one eye to see Rio standing over her with a small dissolvable tablet. </span></p><p><span>“Open,” Rio instructs. </span></p><p><span>Agatha’s mouth drops open and Rio drops the pill in. Agatha lets her head sink back into the pillow. </span></p><p><span>A finger pokes her shoulder again, waking her. </span></p><p><span>“Water,” Rio guides the glass to Agatha’s mouth as she sits up slightly. She takes a few large gulps then settles into the pillow once more. </span></p><p><span>Then she feels a blanket being dragged up over her, tucked gently into her sides.</span></p><p><span>“Why are you helping me?” She mumbles. </span></p><p><span>Rio’s back is turned, rummaging through a cabinet. She turns around with an armful of plastic tubing and supplies. </span></p><p><span>“So you don’t die on my couch,” Rio sticks her tongue in her cheek. She kneels beside the couch, laying everything out on the coffee table. She starts opening packages, lining up supplies in a neat line. </span></p><p><span>“Arm please,” she sticks her hand out. As Agatha rests her arm in Rio’s hand, she presses along her inner elbow for a vein. A bright orange tourniquet gets snapped around her arm. </span></p><p><span>Only now does Agatha really notice what’s on the table - tubing, bandages, needles and a large bag of saline. </span></p><p><span>“You’re giving me an IV?”</span></p><p><span>“Honey, trust me. You need it.” </span></p><p><span>“Where did you even get the supplies?” She hiccups softly. </span></p><p><span>“Hospital supply closet. Expired. They throw them out anyway.” </span></p><p><span>“Is this even safe?”</span></p><p><span>“Shut up and close your eyes,” Rio warns. “Big poke,” she says in a pandering voice. </span></p><p><span>Agatha winces as the needle slides in her arm. </span></p><p><span>Rio works silently, securing the line to Agatha’s arm with a small clear bandage. She hooks up the IV tubing, placing the bag of fluids on the couch behind Agatha’s head. </span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes close again, feeling drowsy, like her limbs are too heavy for her body - a mixture of booze and fatigue. She feels Rio’s hand ghost across her forehead, sweeping back a loose strand of hair. </span></p><p><span>Rio must think she’s asleep. Otherwise she wouldn’t be touching her like that. </span></p><p><span>“You know I love you, right?” Agatha murmurs. </span></p><p><span>Rio stills. Her hand hovers a moment longer - then slips away. </span></p><p><span>“You’re drunk,” Rio murmurs.</span></p><p><span>Agatha hiccups, blinking up at her. “I am,” she admits. “But that’s why I came over. Why I called. To tell you that.” </span></p><p><span>“Oh,” Rio breathes. She settles onto the floor again, her back resting against the couch next to Agatha’s head. She doesn’t say more, almost like she’s letting the words soak through her. </span></p><p><span>Agatha closes her eyes, slowly. Her breathing evens out, soft puffs of air drifting toward Rio until she’s fully asleep.</span></p><p><span>Rio leans her head back, letting her hair rest next to Agatha’s forehead. </span></p><p><span>“I wish that was true,” Rio whispers to no one. </span></p><p><span>—</span></p><p><span>Agatha can hear voices. Two females ones. Rio’s she recognizes instantly, the other feels vaguely familiar but she can’t place it. </span></p><p><span>She keeps her eyes closed from her place on the couch, faking sleep for a while longer as she focuses on the other voice. </span></p><p><span>It’s hard to think clearly with the pounding in her head. </span></p><p><span>“She’s really pretty, Rio,” she hears the other woman say. </span></p><p><span>“I know,” Rio sighs. “Don’t tell her that. I don’t need it going to her head,” she chuckles. </span></p><p><span>Agatha hears Rio tell her goodbye. Then the sound of footsteps and the soft click of the front door. </span></p><p><span>“You can open your eyes now Agatha,” Rio calls from across the room, probably in the kitchen. “You don’t have to fake sleep anymore.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha rubs her eyes and stretches, prolonging the ruse just a little bit longer. She can smell the scent of coffee now drifting in from the kitchen. </span></p><p><span>Rio comes back with a steaming mug in her hand and offers it to Agatha as she sits up. </span></p><p><span>As Agatha reaches out, she notices the small bandage across her inner elbow. She furrows her brow. </span></p><p><span>“When did I get injured?” She questions, looking at Rio. </span></p><p><span>“You don’t remember?” Rio asks.</span></p><p><span>Agatha shakes her head. “I remember the bar. Billy was there. And a lot of drinks. I think there was a dance floor.” She shrugs. “Did you come get me?” </span></p><p><span>“You showed up,” Rio explains. “Destroyed my plastic Santa. He was vintage by the way.” </span></p><p><span>“Shit,” Agatha drops her head in her hands. “I’m sorry. For all of it. I didn’t do anything else embarrassing, did it?”</span></p><p><span>“No, that was it,” Rio lies. “You came in and passed out on the couch. I gave you some IV fluids.” She nods at the bandage. </span></p><p><span>“And,” Agatha glances between them. “Nothing else happened?”</span></p><p><span>“Agatha,” Rio’s tone turns serious. “I would never take advantage of you like that in a drunken state.” </span></p><p><span>“I know,” Agatha admits, a small smile tugging at her lips. “But I can get pretty flirty when I’m drunk.”</span></p><p><span>“And sentimental,” Rio adds under her breath. </span></p><p><span>“What?”</span></p><p><span>“Nothing,” she says quickly.</span></p><p><span>Agatha rises from the couch, mug in hand as she looks around the living room.</span></p><p><span>She pauses in one corner where there is a round table covered in a small red sheet with a Christmas tree on top.</span></p><p><span>“You got a tiny Christmas tree.”</span></p><p><span>“Yeah,” Rio hesitates. </span></p><p><span>“It doesn’t have any ornaments.”</span></p><p><span>“Well I bought it a while ago. I had hoped we could…” Rio shakes her head. “You know what, nevermind.”</span></p><p><span>The silence stretches between them, Agatha’s fingers gently brushing along the plastic branches. </span></p><p><span>Finally Rio speaks up, “I should explain this morning.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha stiffens, her shoulders tightening. “No need. You have your life, I have mine.” She turns back toward Rio, setting the coffee cup on the table before smoothing out her pants. “I should get going anyway, thank you for taking care of me.” She bends down and grabs her shoes, not bothering to put them on. “Again, sorry I showed up. And broke your plastic thing. I can pay for it…really…and…”</span></p><p><span>“Agatha, that was my cousin,” Rio cuts her off. </span></p><p><span>“The Santa?” Agatha jokes. Rio huffs. </span></p><p><span>“The woman here last night. And this morning. That was my cousin. I haven’t seen her in years. She came into town for Christmas. We had dinner with my family and I have an extra bedroom, so she stayed here for the night.”</span></p><p><span>“You aren’t dating someone,” Agatha says almost in disbelief. </span></p><p><span>“Nope,” Rio adds. “When you said you wanted more time, I took you seriously. I waited. And then the gala - you told me to stop pursuing you. And I did. But that doesn’t mean I started pursuing other people.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallows, her heart racing. “You waited for me.”</span></p><p><span>“I did,” Rio says softly, almost a whisper. </span></p><p><span>Agatha drops her shoes onto the floor and takes three giant strides toward Rio. She grabs the side of her face, leans in, kissing her tentatively. Her lips press into Rio’s until she slowly opens her mouth. </span></p><p><span>It’s light, fleeting - reassurance and relief. </span></p><p><span>Then Rio winces a bit as she slowly pulls back.</span></p><p><span>“I’m sorry,” Agatha starts rushing, the words coming quickly. “I shouldn’t have assumed, just because you said…”</span></p><p><span>“It’s not that,” Rio starts. “You threw up a lot last night.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha covers her mouth, realizing. “Still have my toothbrush?” She asks. </span></p><p><span>“Yeah. It’s….” She gestures toward the bathroom. </span></p><p><span>Agatha smiles. “Be right back.” </span></p><p><span>Rio sighs. The whole morning is going better than she expected. It’s not quite the love confession of last night, but at least Agatha is sober and telling the truth. At least they aren’t fighting. Or pushing each other away. </span></p><p><span>A firm knock on the door interrupts her thoughts. </span></p><p><span>Rio peers through the peep hole to see two uniformed male police officers staring back at her. </span></p><p><span>Evanora stands next to them, bundled in an oversized coat with a handkerchief in her hand. </span></p><p><span>For fuck’s sake. </span></p><p><span>“Can I help you?” Rio opens the door just wide enough to stick her head out. </span></p><p><span>“We have reports of a missing person.” </span></p><p><span>“My baby!” Evanora wails, dabbing her eyes with the handkerchief. Not a single tear is visible. </span></p><p><span>“Do you know the whereabouts of Agatha Harkness?” the taller officer asks. </span></p><p><span>“She’s a grown adult,” Rio growls in a low voice. “She came over voluntarily,” </span></p><p><span>“Rio?” Agatha’s voice comes from behind her. “What’s the matter?” </span></p><p><span>“Is that her, ma’am?” The officer leans forward, trying to see past her. </span></p><p><span>Rio opens the door wider until Agatha is visible next to her. She’s scrubbed her face free of her makeup but is still in her club clothes from last night, feet bare. </span></p><p><span>“Oh my goodness! There she is!” Evanora chokes out. “Come here darling!” She exclaims as she reaches her arms out. </span></p><p><span>Agatha doesn’t move, “Good lord.” She rolls her eyes at the acting display in front of her. “Let me get my stuff,” she deadpans. </span></p><p><span>Rio’s jaw clenches. “You don’t have to go with her,” Rio points out. </span></p><p><span>Agatha turns, grabbing her shoes before slipping them on. She squeezes Rio’s arm as she passes, trying to reassure her. </span></p><p><span>“It’s just easier this way. Don’t worry about me.” she whispers. “Let’s not cause a scene,” she brushes it off like it’s an everyday occurrence. </span></p><p><span>Evanora moves in instantly, blocking a path from Rio to Agatha. “I’d like to press charges,” she scowls at the officers. </span></p><p><span>“For what exactly?” </span></p><p><span>“Child endangerment. Kidnapping.” </span></p><p><span>“She’s not a minor, ma’am,” the officer replies flatly. “She appears unharmed.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m the one who came over here, Mother.”</span></p><p><span>Evanora’s eyes flare, then she balls up the handkerchief and throws it on the porch. She stomps down the stairs off the porch toward her car. </span></p><p><span>Despite Rio’s concern, Agatha actually chuckles at the antics, like she’s watching a toddler throw a tantrum. </span></p><p><span>“Agatha,” Rio warns one last time as the group starts to leave. “Are you sure?” </span></p><p><span>“I’ll call you tonight,” Agatha smiles as she skips down the porch toward the car. </span></p><p><span>—</span></p><p><span>Rio attempts to busy herself for the day. She cleans up the massacred Santa mess, hoses off several spots of vomit from her front porch and sidewalk and clears out the IV tubing from last night. </span></p><p><span>Her phone stays glued to her side the entire time. Every notification, every buzz has her reaching for it - hoping to hear from Agatha again. </span></p><p><span>But nothing. </span></p><p><span>Agatha said she would call her, and she’s trying to give her that space to do so. But as the sun sets, she tells herself that by 8pm, she’s calling her. </span></p><p><span>The clock reads 7:32pm when Rio’s phone finally buzzes. </span></p><p><em><span>Made it home</span></em><span> - is all the message reads. Flat, no detail. And certainly not a recent event. </span></p><p><span>Another message follows seconds later: </span><em><span>I’m sorry about all of it. </span></em></p><p><span>Rio isn’t sure what she’s apologizing for - the drunken visit, the Santa, her mother. None of that matters. </span></p><p><span>At this moment Rio cares about two things - first and foremost that Agatha is ok; which seems to be the case. </span></p><p><span>Second. she really wants to talk about is the drunken confession; the one Rio is sure Agatha doesn’t remember. And the emotional morning and kissing her - now that Rio cares about. </span></p><p><span>Her thumbs hover over the screen, typing and retyping the messages a few times to try to phrase it best. </span></p><p><span>Finally, she settles on the simplest thing. </span><em><span>The important thing is you are okay. </span></em></p><p><em><span>You worry too much</span></em><span> - comes the quick response. </span></p><p><em><span>Can you blame me? You basically live with the devil herself - </span></em><span>Rio replies.</span></p><p><em><span>The devil has gone back to ignoring me completely while she drinks in her office. So don’t fret tonight, I’m safe in my room :) </span></em></p><p><span>Rio tries to believe her, but something eats at her tonight. She doesn’t know what it is - call it intuition, or maybe paranoia. But something feels off.</span></p><p><span>Rio keeps her phone on ring tonight. Just in case. </span></p><p><span>—</span></p><p><span>Sure enough, by 3am her phone rings. The noise is too loud, startling her from her sleep. </span></p><p><span>Agatha. </span></p><p><span>Rio laughs into the speaker as she answers. “I swear to God if you are drunk again and begging to come over…” </span></p><p><span>But the words die mid-sentence. </span></p><p><span>No laughter. No words at all. </span></p><p><span>Instead, the sound that runs through the phone makes her blood run cold - someone screaming. Then an older woman yelling. Evanora. The noise is piercing. </span></p><p><span>Rio strains to make sense of it, pressing the phone tight to her ear. Fragments slip through - </span><em><span>ungrateful…little bitch…killed you…left my body. </span></em><span> </span></p><p><span>“Agatha?” Rio’s voice cracks. The desperation building. “Agatha, are you there? Are you safe?” </span></p><p><span>No reply. </span></p><p><span>“Mother! I didn’t do anything!” Agatha’s voice bursts through suddenly, faint and distant, like she’s yelling across the room. </span></p><p><span>There is more yelling, indistinguishable between the two of them.</span></p><p><span>A crash follows. The shattering of glass. </span></p><p><span>“Fuck! Agatha?” Rio’s heart lurches. “Where are you?” But as she says it, she’s already moving. Her keys and phone in her hand, feet pounding across the floor. </span></p><p><span>“Agatha, I need an address!” She yells into the speaker but still gets no response.</span></p><p><span>Then it hits her. She knows the address, vaguely. The street name is buried in her memory from that night she drove her home after ice cream. </span></p><p><span>She’s in her car seconds later, still in her pajamas. She’s racing down the street, not bothering to even glance at the speed limit. Her tires screech as she rounds the corner to Agatha’s house, the colonial pillars looming in the distance. </span></p><p><span>Even before she turns off the car engine, she can hear the yelling. </span></p><p><span>Her hand reflectively grabs her phone, ready to call 911. Then she stops. Evanora already spun a missing person’s report. She went after her job. She went after them.</span></p><p><span>Rio is done trying to do the right thing. </span></p><p><span>She’s taking care of this one on her own.</span></p><p><span>She’s halfway down the sidewalk when the front door flies open. Agatha bursts out barefoot, hair tangled. Her cheeks are red, either from tears or Evanora’s hand. Her eyes look panicked until they lock on Rio - then a flash of relief washing over them. And then she’s gone, rushing past her on the walkway. </span></p><p><span>“Get in the car, Agatha,” Rio commands, an authority coming through her voice that she didn’t know she had. </span></p><p><span>Rio makes it to the porch just before Evanora comes out of the door, looking furious and vindictive, a wooden cane in her hand. </span></p><p><span>“What are you doing here?” Evanora hisses as she sees Rio. “You’re like a cockroach that just won’t die.” </span></p><p><span>In an instant, the cane rises, a flash of polished wood above Rio’s head. Her body reacts before her brain can catch up - her hand coming up to block the blow. She catches the cane mid-swing but as she does, a sting of pain shoots through her hand, radiating up her arm. </span></p><p><span>She’s thankful for her strength at this moment, enough to rip the cane from Evanora’s hands. She snaps it over the knee, splintering the wood in two with a crack. Two jagged ends are left and she presses them toward Evanora’s face. </span></p><p><span>“I swear to God, you touch her again,” she growls. “And I’ll kill you.”</span></p><p><span>Evanora’s eyes narrow at her.</span></p><p><span>Rio backs away without taking her eyes off of her, the cane still in her hand as if it’s a weapon to shield her. </span></p><p><span>“You can’t have her,” Rio snarls possessively as she turns to leave. </span></p><p><span>“Fine,” Evanora laughs, but something dark and soulless. “She’s your problem now!”</span></p><p><span>As Rio moves, she hears Evanora muttering “evil girl” under her breath. </span></p><p><span>Rio pivots to find Agatha already in the passenger seat, folded over with her face buried in her face, as if hiding will make the whole scene stop existing. </span></p><p><span>Rio drops the cane halves onto the sidewalk. She says nothing as she slides into the driver’s seat, pulling the door closed and locking it. Her knuckles grip the steering wheel hard, and that’s when Rio feels it - the shooting pain through her hand flaring. She winces at the pain but swallows it down - focused more on getting Agatha to safety. </span></p><p><span>Only once they’ve turned a corner and Rio feels they’ve put some distance between them does Rio slow down and look at Agatha. </span></p><p><span>Agatha sits with her knees drawn up to her chest , tears silently spilling down her cheeks. She looks hollow, like the shell of her former self. </span></p><p><span>“You can’t stay there anymore,” Rio says, her words clipped. “I don’t care if you don’t want to stay with me. Just anywhere that isn’t her house. She </span><em><span>will</span></em><span> kill you Agatha.” </span></p><p><span>“I know,” Agatha says, her voice barely above a whisper. </span></p><p><span>But Rio pushes forward. “I’m not being dramatic. I’m being realistic.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha closes her eyes, nodding once. </span></p><p><span>Rio doesn’t turn the car toward home. It doesn’t feel right. Not yet. Instead she keeps driving, away from the glow of the city, around the small curves of the mountains until she reaches a small overlook carved out in the dark. Gravel crunches under her tires where she pulls into a turn out. From here, the lights of the city shine below. Far away. Like they are outrunning their problems. </span></p><p><span>Rio hears Agatha’s heavy exhale next to her, relief mixed with sadness. The weight of the night sits heavy between them. </span></p><p><span>Wordlessly, Agatha reaches across the center console and gently threads her fingers through Rio’s. </span></p><p><span>The sharp pain returns and Rio tries to hide the wince, but fails.  </span></p><p><span>“You’re injured,” Agatha’s voice is edged with alarm. She flicks on the car overhead light to examine it. Her fingertips skim along the back before she turns it over, revealing the dark purple bruising blossoming along the palm. She tests each finger, careful and clinical, pressing along the joints to search for fractures. When she finds none, she releases Rio’s hand, but doesn’t say anything. She just moves. </span></p><p><span>The car door is shoved open as the cold air rushes in. </span></p><p><span>Agatha steps out, not bothering to close the door behind her. Then she’s taking two steps before she folds - bending over with her hands braced on her knees. </span></p><p><span>It’s like the flood gates open. </span></p><p><span>A strangled breath escapes her throat, and then another before she’s sobbing. Her shoulders shaking, breath heaving, the tears start running down her cheeks. </span></p><p><span>The years of terror, shame, pure survival coming bubbling to the surface, pouring out as hot tears from her eyes. The sound is sharp and gutting - bouncing off the surrounding canyon. </span></p><p><span>It is a cry of mourning what was lost and fearing what’s to come. It’s the kind of cry that starts deep, buried somewhere in her soul, breaking free with the force of something long since dammed up. </span></p><p><span>Instantly, Rio is out of the car, rounding the front until she’s standing behind her. Agatha doesn’t look up, she just sobs harder until she’s coughing, sputtering to catch her breath. </span></p><p><span>“I’m right here,” Rio whispers. But she isn’t sure if she should touch her or just let her go. “You’re safe now.” But she’s close enough to catch her if she collapses, far enough away that Agatha can choose. </span></p><p><span>The words rip her something from her and her hand reaches behind her to grasp for Rio. </span></p><p><span>She pulls at her, gesturing her to move. Rio steps forward, sliding one arm around Agatha’s waist from behind. Agatha leans back into her instantly, melting into the hold. </span></p><p><span>Agatha’s fingers clench at Rio’s arm, fingers digging into the flesh as she sobs. Her head drops back so that Rio takes some of the weight of her. </span></p><p><span>“I can’t…” the words come out choked. Her chest heaves in jagged, uncontrolled waves. </span></p><p><span>Rio leans forward, resting her cheek next to Agatha’s to breathe with her. Grounding her. She holds her as she cries into the space between them, letting her ride out the storm. </span></p><p><span>Finally, when she can’t cry anymore, she stands up straight again. Agatha wipes her eyes with the back of her hand.</span></p><p><span>She swallows hard, shaking her head like she’s closing the door on something. </span></p><p><span>“Let’s go home.” </span></p><p> </p>

<p> </p><p><span>Rio releases Agatha slowly, her arms still outstretched in case Agatha’s knees buckle. Agatha doesn’t look at her, she circles back to the car and slips inside, shutting the door behind her with a soft click. </span></p><p><span>They start to drive back in silence. </span></p><p><span>Agatha sinks low in her seat, chin tucked. Rio can see her out of the corner of her eye - lips pressed together, eyes fixed on the passing city lights. She looks like she’s fighting something. Her breathing still stutters in tiny, fractured inhales, but she keeps her mouth pursed tight, like she’s trying to force every stray emotion back where it came from. </span></p><p><span>“You can stop watching me like that,” Agatha says without turning her head. “I’m fine.” </span></p><p><span>“But you don’t have to be.” </span></p><p><span>That makes Agatha glance over. She studies Rio’s face for a moment before offering a small, almost apologetic smile. </span></p><p><span>“Sorry you had to come to my rescue,” Agatha sighs. “Again.” </span></p><p><span>“You know I don’t mind.” </span></p><p><span>“That’s not what this relationship should be though.” Agatha shakes her head. “Me calling you to bail me out of my problems.” </span></p><p><span>“Oh so it’s a relationship now?” Rio half-jokes. </span></p><p><span>Agatha’s gaze drifts back to the window, her voice quiet. “I just…I don’t want you to think I’m using you. Or that I’m making you responsible for every mess I get myself into.” </span></p><p><span>“Agatha,” Rio says gently. “I make my own choices. Calling me isn’t the problem.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha swallows, the nerves appearing to set in. “Then what is?”</span></p><p><span>“That you think you’re a burden.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha shifts in her seat, the unfamiliar words settling inside her. “You don’t understand,” she says. “Everyone tires of me eventually.” </span></p><p><span>Rio reaches over, her chest tight. Her hand lands on Agatha’s knee, the touch tentative. “I’m not everyone.” </span></p><p><span>Rio can see the relief coming off Agatha in waves. Like her words finally struck a cord - one Rio has been trying to unravel for some time now. One that Agatha revealed on that drunken night but only now seems to accept. </span></p><p><span>They turn down Rio’s street, pulling into her driveway just as the sun starts to rise. </span></p><p><span>“We’re here,” Rio says softly as she turns off the car. </span></p><p><span>But Agatha doesn’t move to unbuckle her seatbelt. She stays still, watching Rio. When Rio meets her eyes, they are no longer cloudy with unshed tears and grief - but dark and dangerous. The look creates a familiar burn in Rio’s stomach. </span></p><p><span>When Agatha speaks, the words come out huskier than before. “Is it too much to say I want you right now?”</span></p><p><span>For a moment, Rio only stares at her, processing her words, the shift in her voice, the way the air tilts between them becoming more charged. </span></p><p><span>“No,” Rio swallows. “It’s not too much.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha unbuckles her seatbelt with a click - the noise louder than it should be inside the small space. She doesn’t break eye contact as she leans in, closing the inches between their seats. There is no hesitation, no doubt - just intent, mixed with trust as she leans in to kiss her. </span></p><p><span>“Tell me to stop,” Agatha is a breath away from her lips. </span></p><p><span>“You know I won’t,” Rio leans in, her lips just grazing Agatha’s. </span></p><p><span>Agatha is on her in an instant. One hand slides to the back of Rio’s head, fingers settling at the nape of her neck as she pulls her forward.</span></p><p><span>The angle is awkward, the center console wedged between them, but still Rio tries to maneuver from the driver’s seat toward her. She climbs into the passenger’s seat, knees on either side or Agatha. Agatha’s hands find her hips the moment she shifts, guiding her down until she’s flush against her pelvis. </span></p><p><span>This time when she kisses her, it feels different. Like they have nothing holding them back anymore. No barrier between them. Sure, Agatha’s impending marriage looms in the background but suddenly it doesn’t feel like a cloud of doom, but something that can tackle together. </span></p><p><span>Then Agatha’s hands slip beneath her shirt, her palms warm as they skim the skin of her stomach and rise to the underside of her breasts. Rio inhales sharply, heat sparking everywhere her fingers trail. It’s been too long since Agatha touched her like this - with this sort of freedom, this sort of touch that feels like she’s memorizing her. </span></p><p><span>Rio’s hand blindly reaches for the door handle, fumbling until she pushes the door open. The cold air rushes into the car. </span></p><p><span>As much as she’s enjoying the way the windows fog with the heat of their exchange, she wants Agatha underneath her. Naked, sprawled across her bed.  </span></p><p><span>They stumble out of the car - a mess of tangled limbs as they try to walk and kiss at the seam time. Agatha’s fingers fist into the front of Rio’s shirt, tugging her toward the door. Rio grabs the handle by muscle memory, realizing she never bothered to lock it when she rushed out of there earlier tonight. </span></p><p><span>As soon as they slip into the dim apartment, her lips find Agatha’s again. Clothes come off in a hurry, landing in random piles along the living room and hallway. But as soon as Rio has Agatha beneath her on her bed, she stops. </span></p><p><span>She steps back, admiring the view of her - pale skin visible against the dim light of her room, hair wild and untamed against her bedspread, a slight shine along her thighs of how much she wants her. </span></p><p><span>Rio wants to take her time with her. </span></p><p><span>To show her that for all the bullshit she went through with her mother, every insecurity she felt, every doubt about them - she was more than all of it. </span></p><p><span>So now as she parts Agatha’s thighs, her head between her legs, she takes her time licking up the length of her.</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s head falls back onto the pillow with a sigh. Her fingers thread through Rio’s hair, tugging lightly at the root. </span></p><p><span>She’s so wet she would be embarrassed if it wasn’t for the way Rio lapped at her. She circles her clit with her tongue, then coats her tongue in her arousal. </span></p><p><span>“Fuck,” Rio’s voice is raspy. “You taste amazing.”</span></p><p><span>She grinds her hips into Rio, chasing more pressure. And Rio lets her take what she needs. </span></p><p><span>Rio slips one finger inside of her, hearing Agatha groan above her as she does. So she adds another, curling them both upward. </span></p><p><span>The motion sends Agatha’s hips clenching around her head. </span></p><p><span>“So good for me,” Rio’s praise reverberating deep in Agatha’s chest. “So perfect.” </span></p><p><span>Rio’s lips find her clit, swirling around it before sucking on the swallow bud. </span></p><p><span>She works at her until Agatha’s trembling beneath her, her pussy clenching at her fingers. </span></p><p><span>Agatha sobs Rio’s name as she comes, the tear pricking the edge of her eyes. </span></p><p><span>Rio’s fingers slow inside of her before withdrawing completely. She doesn’t move from her space between her, but licks each finger clean. </span></p><p><span>“I’m not moving in with you,” comes Agatha’s voice above her. </span></p><p><span>Rio pauses. Her lips are still pressed against Agatha’s inner thigh. “Weird time to say that,” she murmurs, lifting her head slightly. “While my mouth is still on you. But…ok.” </span></p><p><span>“Sorry. It’s not…” Agatha winces at her own timing. “It’s not like that.”</span></p><p><span>Rio wipes her mouth with the back of her hand and crawls up beside her, settling on her side, waiting. Agatha pushes herself up on an elbow. “I want to start fresh. I’ve lived under Evanora’s thumb for so now…I just need space to figure things out on my own.” </span></p><p><span>Rio freezes. </span></p><p><span>It feels like the same conversation all over again. Back to Agatha pulling away, especially after an intimate moment. Rio sits up, creating space without thinking. </span></p><p><span>Agatha notices instantly. </span></p><p><span>“Wait,” She reaches her hand out, closing it around Rio’s thigh. “Just hear me out.” </span></p><p><span>Rio’s jaw tightens. </span></p><p><span>Agatha shifts closer. “I want you. I do.” Her thumb starts rubbing small circles against Rio’s skin. “But I also want to learn how to live on my own. I’ve never had that. I want to be my own person and be with you. At the same time. I realize now it doesn’t have to be one or the other.” </span></p><p><span>Rio exhales, releasing the tension. </span></p><p><span>“We can do that,” she smiles tentatively. </span></p><p><span>“We can?” Agatha asks hopefully. </span></p><p><span>“Tomorrow we go apartment hunting.”</span></p><p><span>—</span></p><p><span>“Agatha, this place is disgusting.” </span></p><p><span>It’s the third apartment they’ve looked at. The first two made Rio realize, painfully, that Agatha has absolutely no concept of what her budget can actually buy. </span></p><p><span>The third place looks like it should be condemned. The floor is ripping up in places, paint is peeling from the walls and the oven is so small it looks like an Easy-Bake oven. </span></p><p><span>“It has charm,” Agatha insists weakly, stepping over a soft spot in the floor. </span></p><p><span>“And cockroaches,” Rio watches it run across the floor in front of Agatha’s foot. She yells, dodging it sideways.</span></p><p><span>“Absolutely not. Nope. Goodbye,” she declares, beelining it for the door. </span></p><p><span>Rio follows, biting back a smile. “So is that a no?” She pulls the door closed behind them. “You know my place is still available.”</span></p><p><span>But Agatha is hardly listening. Her phone is in her hand, fingers flying across the screen as she speed walks down the creaking hallway. </span></p><p><span>“Billy,” she says as the call connects without even saying hello. “Does that offer to be your roommate still stand?” </span></p><p><span>Rio can hear the delighted shrieking on the other end. </span></p><p><span>She hangs up, looking relieved as they make their way back toward Rio’s car. </span></p><p><span>“Ok, next step, we have to work on a budget for you,” Rio says as they make their way back to her car. “For things like groceries, clothing, gas in your car.” </span></p><p><span>“Why?” Agatha gives her a disgusted look. “It’s not that they are that expensive. What’s a banana cost like $10?”</span></p><p><span>“You’ve never actually stepped foot in a grocery store have you?” </span></p><p><span>Agatha groans. </span></p><p><span>—</span></p><p><span>Today Rio promised to come over and see her new place. Well technically the place she shares with Billy. </span></p><p><span>A slight pit in her stomach forms as she starts to drive across town toward the modest row of apartments. If Billy is home, it’s a silent confirmation of everything he’s suspected. Although she’s fairly certain he figured it out, but them being together in front of him felt different. Real. </span></p><p><span>She finds the apartment number Agatha gave her, knocking once with no answer. Finally she tries the handle and finds it unlocked. </span></p><p><span>The living room is a cluttered maximalist’s dream. Mismatched couches and chairs line the wall. </span><span>Every corner is stuffed with a nicknack - figurines from various shows and movies, posters lining the walls. A bookshelf along one wall is overflowing with medical textbooks and journals. </span></p><p><span>“Hello?” Rio questions. </span></p><p><span>“In here!” Comes Agatha’s response from another room. </span></p><p><span>She finds Agatha sitting cross legged on the bedroom floor. Her walls are bare. Two suitcases are open on the floor, clothes spilling out. She managed to claim a few items from her mother’s house, a visit that was done under the careful supervision of Billy. </span></p><p><span>She has a brand new mattress on the floor, new sheets and a simple comforter lie on top. </span></p><p><span>Agatha is staring at a heap of wooden slats and screws. Not a single tool is found around her. </span></p><p><span>“It’s supposed to be a bed frame,” Agatha says, sighing. </span></p><p><span>Rio squats down next to her, surveying the damage. “Let’s just start with the instructions.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha hands them over. “I’m literally on step 1.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s ok,” Rio tries to be reassuring. “Tools?”</span></p><p><span>“I don’t have any.”</span></p><p><span>Rio stands, her knees cracking slightly as she does. “Luckily I came prepared.” She heads over to her stuff, dropped near Agatha’s bedroom door. “Your very own starter tool kit.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha blinks as Rio sets down the small zippered case. Agatha opens it, pulling out a few tools. “A level?”</span></p><p><span>“And a small screwdriver set.”</span></p><p><span>“You bought me tools.” The words came out soft. </span></p><p><span>Rio shrugs. “I figured you’d need them. It was nothing.”</span></p><p><span>But Agatha smiles, her eyes soft. “It was thoughtful. That’s something.”</span></p><p><span>Rio stares at her. For a second, their eyes meet and Agatha looks like she’s about to say something…something on the tip of her tongue. And in a flash, it’s gone. She bites her lip, busying herself by examining the screwdrivers. </span></p><p><span>Rio sighs before she grabs the instructions and starts sorting through the wood pieces. </span></p><p><span>She mostly instructs Agatha to hand her pieces or read the next step. Half the time she looks over to find Agatha texting or scrolling Tik Tok anyway. </span></p><p><span>“Okay,” Rio grunts as she heaves the frame to the side, starting to see the final shape of it. “What’s next?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha crawls from her cozy spot on the mattress to the instruction booklet.  “It says we need…the cross one.” </span></p><p><span>“The Phillips?”</span></p><p><span>“I’m no good at this,” she huffs, flopping back dramatically onto the bed. </span></p><p><span>“You are learning. It’s fine.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m no good at all of it. Really. I’m a mess. Look at me.” She gestures vaguely around the half-unpacked room like it proves her point. </span></p><p><span>Rio wipes the sweat from her brow. “What are you even talking about?” </span></p><p><span>“The mommy issues. The arranged, yet somehow still failed engagement.” </span></p><p><span>Rio almost laughs, her mouth tugging into a smile. </span></p><p><span>“Don’t laugh at me.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m not,” Rio says softly. “You fail to see all the good in you, Agatha. In spite of the shit your mother put you through for your entire life. You are still good. You just don’t see it.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyes grow shiny, brimming with tears that she tries to blink away. </span></p><p><span>Rio keeps going, unable to stop now that it’s coming out. </span></p><p><span>“You might pretend you don’t give a fuck. But you do, You might be the only one who does. You know your patients by name, not diagnosis. You sit with them. You hold their hand. You don’t let them die alone. That’s something special. Even if you don’t see it.” </span></p><p><span>“Shit,” Agatha says, sitting up straighter. “I was being a bit dramatic. But damn.” </span></p><p><span>“Oh, sorry, I didn’t mean…” Rio starts back peddling, realizing she took the moment more seriously than Agatha intended. </span></p><p><span>Agatha only smiles at her. A genuine smile. She bites her lip, and for a split second, Rio swears she’s being looked at like she’s endearing. Agatha’s head tilts, her eyes softening. </span></p><p><span>It makes Rio’s stomach lurch at the feeling. </span></p><p><span>Agatha inhales, her lips parting as if she’s about to say something. </span></p><p><span>Rio knows exactly what it sounds like in her imagination. </span></p><p><span>But then Agatha blinks and the moment is lost. </span></p><p><span>“Anyway,” Agatha says dramatically, forcing the lightness back in her voice. “Bedframe.” </span></p><p><span>Rio forces herself to refocus on the bedframe instead of whatever the hell that was. </span></p><p><span>“Well, it’s ready,” Rio plants her arms on either side of the frame, heaving it toward the mattress. Together they slide the bed frame into place then, with a bit of a struggle, lift the mattress on top.</span></p><p><span>Agatha sits down on the bed with a little bounce. Then flops down sideways, limbs splayed. Rio plants herself next to her, sitting on the edge of the bed until Agatha grabs at the back of her shirt. She yanks the material until Rio is falling backward next to her. </span></p><p><span>They lay like that, next to each other, fingers brushing while they stare at the ceiling. </span></p><p><span>It feels peaceful, comfortable -  like Rio could throw an arm over Agatha’s middle and fall asleep next to her. </span></p><p><span>“I bought something else,” Agatha jumps up suddenly. The bed squeaks a little as she moves off it. Then she turns to the suitcases, rummaging through the clothes until she pulls out an object. Well two objects. </span></p><p><span>“You didn’t buy tools but you bought a new strap?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha lifts her chin, unbothered. “Priorities.” </span></p><p><span>It feels like a deflection - to drown anything tender or serious under sex and bravado. It’s easier for her. But if Rio is honest with herself, it’s easier for her too. To feel close to Agatha through something physical and uncomplicated. </span></p><p><span>And now that she’s seen the almost-confession in Agatha’s eyes, the confession under the disguise of booze - Rio can feel herself leaning toward the distraction too. Reaching for it. </span></p><p><span>Wanting it.</span></p><p><span>Wanting her. </span></p><p><span>Who is she to resist? </span></p><p><span>When Agatha kisses her, the world stops. </span></p><p><span>She’s melting into her touch, into the way her tongue slides against hers. She missed the time when they existed like this. Carefree, sneaking kisses around corners and stealing orgasms in call rooms. Their little bubble is slowly feeling freer again. </span></p><p><span>As Agatha’s hand holds the back of her head, securing her in place against her. Agatha climbs on top of her, stripping off her shirt in the process and tossing it to the side. </span></p><p><span>It’s a mess of clothes and limbs until Rio is naked beneath her, squirming as Agatha’s tongue finds her nipple. </span></p><p><span>Rio starts to scramble onto all fours, but Agatha’s hand along her back stops her. </span></p><p><span>Agatha smirks. “Face me,” Agatha insists, turning her gently until her back is landed on the comforter. </span></p><p><span>Before Rio can resist to the idea of being face to face with Agatha, she’s met with her eyes - ocean blue and cloudy with arousal. </span></p><p><span>“You want it?” </span></p><p><span>Rio is powerless, her mind a fog that this is really happening again. She really has Agatha, hovering above her, wanting to ruin her. </span></p><p><span>She can only offer a nod.</span></p><p><span>Agatha pushes into her. </span></p><p><span>“Oh fuck,” Rio moans, her head falling back into the pillows. Agatha pulls out entirely before driving back into her. Her hips colliding with Rio’s as she buries the cock to the hilt.  </span></p><p><span>Agatha sets a bruising pace as she drives into her. Her nails dug into her thighs, scratching the skin to leave angry red marks in the wake. </span></p><p><span>Then her hand comes up, curling around Rio’s throat. Rio’s eyes go wide at the sensation, the pressure along her pulse points delicious. </span></p><p><span>It doesn’t take long - with Agatha’s hand around her throat, her cock buried deep inside of her making her feel so full. And now she’s careening toward the edge as Agatha’s pace increases, a thin sheen of sweat now covering her torso. </span></p><p><span>“I’m close,” Rio moans. </span></p><p><span>In that moment, two things happen.</span></p><p><span>The first is a sharp, splintering pop heard from the foot of the bed. One end dips suddenly, the mattress tilting just enough to throw them off balance. </span></p><p><span>But fuck it, Rio is too close to care. She only adjusts her angle, bracing her hands onto the headboard to keep from slipping. Agatha seems unfazed as her hips continue to pound into her. Her fingers work tight, fast circles against Rio’s clit. Rio moans her name, her back arching. </span></p><p><span>She swears her hearing starts to go out because as she’s hitting that high, she hears, somewhere, faintly, Agatha’s voice whispering “mine.” She falls over the edge with her, eyes slamming shut, fingers digging into the comforter as she comes hard. </span></p><p><span>The second thing is the front door. Keys jingle in the lock before the door clicks open, then shut. It’s followed by Billy’s voice, floating down the hallway. Rio realizes, just a moment too late, that they left the bedroom door cracked open. </span></p><p><span>“Hey, I bought some groceries,” his voice calls as he pushes the door open wider, “I thought I could make…” </span></p><p><span>He must have looked up right then. </span></p><p><span>“Oh! Oh my god,” he yelps, turning away. “Dr. Vidal! Agatha! I’m…oh my god..” he spins around so fast he nearly falls, slapping both his hands over his eyes. The grocery bags hit the floor. “Sorry. I didn’t..sorry!” He’s still apologizing as she stumbles into her room and slams the door shut behind him. </span></p><p><span>Agatha crashes on top of Rio, half to shield her, half because her legs are giving out in her own post orgasm haze. </span></p><p><span>“Fuck,” Rio grates. She throws an arm over her eyes as if she can no longer be seen. </span></p><p><span>Agatha laughs - unbothered and unfazed that her new roommate just saw her railing their boss. She presses a lazy kiss to Rio’s cheek before pulling out of her and flopping onto the mattress with a satisfied groan. </span></p><p><span>“I can’t believe he saw that,” Rio says, dragging her hand down her face as she sits up. “How do you always manage to put me in the most compromising situations?” </span></p><p><span>Agatha smirks. “I’m just that charming?”</span></p><p><span>“Reckless,” Rio corrects, but she’s smiling as she says it. “Still, I should go,” She offers, slowly rising from the bed. “Let you try to smooth things over with Billy,” She reaches for her underwear and bra.</span></p><p><span>“And my bed?” Agatha calls after her. “After all, you broke it.”</span></p><p><span>“That was definitely all you,” Rio counters. She crouches beside the frame, inspecting the damage. “It’s not too bad. Couple of screws came loose.” Rio grabs the screwdriver to repair the broken side. </span></p><p><span>Once she’s fully dressed, she glances back to see Agatha removing the strap, discarding it next to her on the bed. </span></p><p><span>“At least wash it,” Rio groans.</span></p><p><span>“Later,” Agatha mumbles, already pulling a blanket around herself like a burrito. “First, nap time. You sure you don’t want to stay?” </span></p><p><span>Rio leans down to press a kiss to her temple. “Next time.” </span></p><p><span>Rio takes 3 steps toward the door when she hears Agatha’s voice again. Quiet, more vulnerable. “It just feels weird…being alone.”  </span></p><p><span>“This place will feel like home, just give it time.”</span></p><p><span>“With Billy? I’m not sure it ever will. It feels more like a place to live.”</span></p><p><span>That’s all it takes and Rio is toeing off her shoes, climbing back into bed. Agatha shifts, curling onto her side. Rio spoons in behind her, throwing her arm over Agatha’s bare middle. </span></p><p><span>“That’s better,” Agatha sighs, smiling. </span></p><p><span>Rio can’t disagree. </span></p><p><span>—</span></p><p><span>Walking into the hospital no longer feels like a punishment. Not the way it did a month ago when Agatha would barely speak to her; when every hallway felt colder and every shift felt longer. And definitely not the way it felt 6 months ago, when they were sneaking around stealing kisses.</span></p><p><span>Today, Rio actually looks forward to being back. </span></p><p><span>Sure, Evanora’s still lurking practically around every corner. And Chloe, her favorite cancer patient, is still battling just to live day by day. </span></p><p><span>But at least she has Agatha. Agatha who’s hair she can thread her fingers through whenever she wants. Agatha who sends her annoying text messages at all hours of the day and night. Agatha who FaceTimes her a thousand times a day asking her how to work her dishwasher or her dryer. Agatha who moans her name when she comes. </span></p><p><span>“Earth to Rio.”</span></p><p><span>“Huh?” Rio looks up to see Jen, leaning over the conference room table staring at her. </span></p><p><span>“Are you actually working?” Jen asks, “Or are you just here to invade my interns’ space?” </span></p><p><span>“I don’t mind,” Agatha says, giving Rio a shameless wink from her seat beside her. </span></p><p><span>“I </span><em><span>am </span></em><span>working,” Rio gestures to her laptop, which is now displaying the screensaver. </span></p><p><span>Jen rolls her eyes. “You two are even more annoying now that you’ve gotten back together.” </span></p><p><span>“Try living with her,” Billy chimes in. “The other day I walked in on – ”</span></p><p><span>Rio coughs. Loudly. And obviously. Beneath the table, there is a loud thud as Billy yells “ow!” Rio is sure it was a kick to the shin from Agatha. </span></p><p><span>“Nevermind.” He starts mumbling under his breath as he rubs his leg. </span></p><p><span>“I’m literally right here,” Agatha snaps. “And it’s under control.” </span></p><p><span>“Sure it is,” Jen says sarcastically. “Like you two haven’t almost caused the collapse of the entire residency program. Congrats again on your toxic relationship.” </span></p><p><span>“You know this is why the residents hate you, right?” Agatha spits. </span></p><p><span>Rio shoots Agatha a grateful smile as she pulls up her next patient chart on her laptop.</span></p><p><span>Thirty minutes later, Rio is ready to tackle the day. She’s finished her second cup of coffee and tied her hair back. She’s just about to close her laptop to see her patients when she decides to check her work email. </span></p><p><span>She wishes she hadn’t.</span></p><p><span>At the top of her inbox sits an email from Evanora. A reply about Chloe’s chemo. Seeing her name makes Rio’s stomach drop. If getting approval for Chloe’s treatment had been an uphill battle before, it’s a sheer cliff now - especially after Rio threatened her on her own porch with a cane. And she took Agatha away that night.</span></p><p><span>She clicks open the email. </span></p><p><span>The letter is short. The “hospital” has decided against funding Chloe’s chemo. No alternatives. No additional time. No referral suggestions or fundraising. Nothing. </span></p><p><span>At the bottom, Evanora issued her final blow:</span></p><p><em><span>Do not contact me again regarding this matter. </span></em></p><p><span>Rio scrubs a hand down her face. She’s out of moves. She feels like she’s watching Chloe’s life fall apart in real time and she’s helpless to stop it. </span></p><p><span>A knock on the conference room door interrupts her thoughts. The entire room looks up. </span></p><p><span>One of the C-suite errand boys lingers in the doorway, clutching a manila envelope. He hesitates, then steps forward and extends the envelope to Rio. Their eyes meet - he looks apologetic and nervous, but Rio is cold and unblinking. </span></p><p><span>She doesn’t take it. Instead she narrows her eyes at him, holding him in a silent standoff. </span></p><p><span>“I’ll take it,” Agatha says quickly, reaching out to grab the envelope. She snatches the paper without any clue what’s inside. </span></p><p><span>The errand boy practically runs out the door before she opens it. </span></p><p><span>Agatha pulls out a single sheet of paper. Her eyes flick over the words and her eyes widen. </span></p><p><span>She purses her lips and hands the paper to Rio. </span></p><p><span>Inside is a printed copy of the same letter. Signed and stamped. Final.</span></p><p><span>Rio doesn’t say another word. She drops the paper on the table, furious. </span></p><p><span>Then she stomps out of the room. </span></p><p><span>As she begins working, the real flood begins. </span></p><p><span>Within the hour, every single chart Rio bills gets bounced back to her. Every test she orders earns an immediate call - lab, radiology, imaging - everyone demands justification for her orders, questioning her judgement like they never have before. </span></p><p><span>It’s like a coordinated, targeted attack. </span></p><p><span>It’s like Evanora turned the entire hospital against her.</span></p><p><span>She doesn’t know how she did it. And she doesn’t care. </span></p><p><span>Instead she tries to focus on the two things that matter - her patients and Agatha. </span></p><p><em><span>Come have lunch with me. Doctors lounge. </span></em></p><p><span>Rio fires off the text to Agatha halfway through the day. She’s seen her only in passing today - fleeting glances at the nurses’ stations, a small wink when no one is looking. But it isn’t enough. She misses the steady comfort of Agatha beside her, the way her presence settles something inside her. </span></p><p><span>Agatha finds her ten minutes later. She drops into the chair next to Rio with a bowl of Greek salad and a plastic fork. She scoots the chair closer to Rio until their elbows touch, an unconscious orbit Rio feels in her bones. </span></p><p><span>“You want to talk about the letter?” She asks as she stabs her lettuce. </span></p><p><span>“Not particularly,” Rio mutters.</span></p><p><span>Agatha huffs, not deterred. “You know she’s started a full-on crusade against you right? I think she’s trying to bully you into quitting.” </span></p><p><span>“So I’ve heard,” Rio groans. “And she can choke on her own disappointment. I’m not going anywhere.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha snorts, pleased. “Atta girl.” She bumps Rio’s arms, a bratty little grin tugging at her mouth. </span></p><p><span>Rio smiles back at her before she turns the conversation serious again. “What about your job?” </span></p><p><span>“It’s mine,” Agatha says, her voice firm. “It may be at her hospital, but I earned being a doctor all on my own. She didn’t take the tests, she didn’t complete the rotations.”</span></p><p><span>“Good girl,” Rio murmurs, the praise slipping out before she can think better of it. </span></p><p><span>Agatha’s cheeks go pink instantly, but she tries to hide it with another stab at her lettuce. “And besides,” she says, clearing her throat, “she won’t fire me. To do that, she’d have to admit she failed. That I didn’t turn out the way she wanted. And she’s got too much pride for that.” </span></p><p><span>Rio watches her. Agatha has come so far in such a short time. She’s pushed back and stopped living in the shadow of her mother’s expectations. Rio wants to take some credit, but she knows better. Agatha did this herself. She needed to. She needed to break free, find her footing - and then find her way back to Rio. </span></p><p><span>The thought makes Rio smile. </span></p><p><span>“What,” Agatha demands, her eyes narrowing. “Why are you smiling like that? What did I do?”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s smile softens. “I’m just proud of you, that’s all.” She wants to lean over and kiss her, right there in the middle of the doctors’ lounge, but she forces herself not to. </span></p><p><span>“Proud of me for calling my mom a cunt?”</span></p><p><span>“Basically,” Rio says. </span><span> </span></p><p><span>—</span></p><p><span>As the day comes to a close, Rio has one final task to complete before she goes home. </span></p><p><span>“Agatha,” Rio finds her typing away at her computer at a nurses’ station. Jen sits not far from her, working on her own charting.</span></p><p><span>Agatha swivels in her chair. “What’s up?”</span></p><p><span>“Have you had a hospice talk with a patient yet?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha furrows her brow, looking a bit nervous. “No…”</span></p><p><span>Rio turns to Jen, “Do you mind?”</span></p><p><span>“I thought you weren’t supposed to be working with residents?” Jen asks. </span></p><p><span>Agatha groans and rolls her eyes. </span></p><p><span>“You going to tell on me?” Rio snaps. “It’s a learning opportunity.” </span></p><p><span>Jen purses her lips but says nothing more, waving them off with a flick of her wrist. “Fine. Go.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha hops off her chair and falls into step beside Rio as they walk toward the elevator bank.</span></p><p><span>“You aren’t required to say anything, it’s my patient,” Rio assures her. “I just want you to hear how I approach it. Get a feel for the verbiage I use.” Rio explains as she pushes the elevator buttons. </span></p><p><span>Agatha nods. “Which patient is it?”</span></p><p><span>“Chloe Burkhardt.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha stops mid-step, her hand coming out to stop the elevator door from closing on her. “Your cancer patient? But Evanora denied her chemo and…Rio, I’m not sure I should be in there.”</span></p><p><span>“Nonsense,” Rio replies, pressing the button for the correct floor. “You aren’t your mother. It wasn’t your decision.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha lets the door go and steps inside. </span></p><p><span>When they step into Chloe’s room, Agatha follows slightly behind Rio, trying to maintain a respectful distance. </span></p><p><span>Her husband, Frank, is at the bedside, laughing with her.</span></p><p><span>But when Rio steps into the room, the air shifts. It’s like they can feel the seriousness of the conversation coming. </span></p><p><span>“We’re going to try something different,” Rio explains after reviewing Chloe’s current medications. “I didn’t want to because the side effects can be so severe but we don’t have anymore options.”</span></p><p><span>Frank looks at her hesitantly. “I’m game,” Chloe says weakly, a small smile on her face.</span></p><p><span>“Hold on,” Frank holds up his hand. “Before she gives the ok, what side effects are we talking about here?”</span></p><p><span>“It’s called doxorubicin, but the nickname is ‘the red devil.’”</span></p><p><span>“Well I don’t like the sound of that,” Chloe says with a hint of humor behind her words.</span></p><p><span>Frank frowns. </span></p><p><span>“Besides the more common side effects like vomiting and hair loss,” Rio starts. “It can cause heart issues.”</span></p><p><span>Frank crosses his arms, leaning back in his chair. Rio can see it coming - the refusal. But she also knows, at this point, they have very few choices.</span></p><p><span>Chloe swallows. “I can’t eat anything anyway and the hair is long since gone.”</span></p><p><span>“Chloe,” Rio grabs a chair, sitting down next to her bed. Agatha moves to stand next to her. “The cardiac side effects can be serious. Heart inflammation called myocarditis, arrhythmias, heart failure. But I’m going to be really honest with you, at this point, we have no other options.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh,” Chloe looks over at Frank. He rises from his spot in his chair to stand next to her bed and take her hand. </span></p><p><span>“We have to try the doxorubicin or I recommend we look into hospice.”</span></p><p><span>“Hospice?” Frank sounds shocked. “Like we just give up? Let her die?” His voice is rising, the anger building. </span></p><p><span>“It’s not giving up at all,” Rio explains. “It’s acknowledging that the disease has run its course and we aren’t going to do anything more to prolong your life. We stop treatment, we stop chemo and we make you comfortable.”</span></p><p><span>Rio can see the tears building in Chloe’s eyes, starting to spill over. But she doesn’t get a chance to speak again before Frank opens his mouth. </span></p><p><span>“Absolutely not,” Frank sounds sure. “I’m not just going to let her die.”</span></p><p><span>“It’s not…” Rio hears Agatha whisper beside her, wanting to speak up. Rio raises a hand to stop her. </span></p><p><span>“I don’t want to hear another word about it,” Frank snaps. </span></p><p><span>—</span></p><p><span>“They didn’t want hospice,” Agatha points out as they step out into the hallway. It’s a question and a statement wrapped into one.</span></p><p><span>“I knew they wouldn’t.”</span></p><p><span>“Then why bring it up?” </span></p><p><span>“The goal wasn’t for them to sign onto hospice today,” Rio replies. “It was to introduce the concept to them. So when the time does come, it’s less of a shock. They will have heard of it before, maybe even have looked into it.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha studies her profile. </span></p><p><span>“Our goal isn’t to get the patients to do what we think is best,” Rio continues. “Sometimes it’s to educate them to make the right decision toward their health later on.” </span></p><p>Agatha seems to consider that. "And you didn't tell her about Evanora's letter."</p><p>Rio shrugs. "Didn't seem worth it. They were already getting angry."</p><p>A beat passes. Then another as Agatha digests her words. Rio lets her sit there, in that moment. She sees the moment the realization sets in.</p><p><span>“You don’t think she’s going to survive,” Agatha says quietly. </span></p><p><span>"No, I don't," Rio shakes her head. “But that doesn’t mean I won’t do everything I can for her in the meantime. If that’s what she wants, even if I don't think that's what is best. It's her body, her health. Not mine.” </span></p><p><span>“Does it ever bother you,” Agatha says finally. “Watching people die day in and day out?”</span></p><p><span>Rio turns it back on her. “Does it bother you?”</span></p><p><span>“No,” Agatha shakes her head. “I guess that’s why I ask. I…” her words are coming out more honestly now. “I don’t take it home with me. I know some people do, like Billy. If a patient dies, it wrecks his entire night. Me? I can watch someone die then go eat pizza in the cafeteria 15 minutes later.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s ok too,” Rio says. </span></p><p><span>“Is it? I feel like I’m supposed to feel more.”</span></p><p><span>“You see Dr. Strange over there?” Rio gestures toward him as he seems to gather himself before going into the next patient room. “The other day he had to tell that family that someone went wrong in surgery and the patient almost died. He had to tell them what happened, say he’s sorry. But then he went back to work. You think anyone else in that room is going back to work today?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shakes her head no. </span></p><p><span>“That’s why we distance ourselves. That’s why we make jokes or pretend we don’t care. It’s so we can get by. It’s not that you don’t care, Agatha, I know you do. It’s because at the end of the day, your job doesn’t just stop with one patient or one death.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha reaches out, her fingers just brushing the back of Rio’s hand where it hangs by her side. “Thank you.” </span></p>

</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p> </p><p>The last time Rio was dragged to a resident party, it was at the retreat. She can’t forget how that ended in total disaster. </p><p>This time, Agatha begged her to come, stating she can’t be alone on New Year’s Eve with no one to kiss.</p><p>Rio countered with dinner and a movie at her place, something quiet. But apparently playing beer pong in a dirty basement with a bunch of residents won out.  </p><p>“I want us to go together,” Agatha murmurs one night as they lay shoulder to shoulder in Rio’s bed. </p><p>“Like a couple.” Rio says. Not a question. Just a clear line in the sand that Rio is daring Agatha to cross. </p><p>“Well yeah,” Agatha adds like it’s obvious, “you ready for that?” </p><p>“Are you?” Rio asks. “It’s not like it can get any worse for me at work.” Her laugh is filled with self-deprecating humor. </p><p>Agatha nods and smiles. “But I’m not coming out of the closet.”</p><p>Rio blinks at her, confused.</p><p>“I’m coming out of the pantry,” Agatha clarifies. “Because I’m a snack.”</p><p>Rio groans before a laugh breaks through. “Oh for fucks sake.”</p><p>And that’s how they ended up here - Crammed into a too small apartment overflowing with residents, plastic cups and cheap booze. Rio opts for slacks and a matching button down vest, casual and still a bit professional. </p><p>Agatha, on the other hand, showed up in full glam - a black strappy dress with side slit that Rio would find ridiculous if it wasn’t also so damn attractive. </p><p>The problem is Rio can’t stop staring at her. Not as she threads them through the crowd, reaching behind her to lace Rio’s fingers with hers. Not as the strap of her dress keeps sliding from her shoulder and Rio makes a point to stroke along her skin every time she puts it back in place. </p><p>Now she really doesn’t want to be here. She wants to have Agatha in her bed, welcoming in the new year with a string of expletives as she comes. </p><p>The sea of resident faces blurs together as Agatha pulls Rio toward the kitchen. Billy is stationed at the counter, lining up Fireball shots. He knocks one back, handing one to Agatha and she does the same. Her face contorts as the cinnamon burn hits.</p><p>Rio declines joining them with the shake of her head. </p><p>“You’re really missing out,” Agatha pouts as she reaches into the ice-filled sink for a beer. </p><p>“I’m really not,” Rio smirks, then takes a beer as well. </p><p>Agatha drifts closer, her hip grazing Rio’s, and leans back against the counter. When she tips her head to drink, her throat arches in a long, elegant line. Rio finds herself watching, following the motion. </p><p>She subconsciously leans in, disregarding where they are to brush her lips close to the column of her neck.  </p><p>“Why Dr. Vidal,” Agatha purrs as Rio’s breath hits her skin. “Are you turning to seduce me?” </p><p>“Is it working?” Rio murmurs. The boldness feels effortless here, their hierarchy stripped away. Tonight, she wants to pretend she isn’t the attending whose job hasn’t been on the line time and time again for this girl. If she’s going to be here, she’s going to enjoy it - and just feel. </p><p>When Agatha laughs, it’s light and airy. Then she takes a step back and her expression shifts, something sly and full of mischief. </p><p>“I’m going to go say hi to a few people,” she winks and kisses Rio’s cheek before darting off. </p><p>Rio doesn’t move down her spot along the kitchen counter. Her fingers grip the can of her beer hard, condensation dripping down them. She’s slightly annoyed at being abandoned, but not truly offended. </p><p>But underneath it, heat stirs because unexpectedly - Agatha is playing hard to get. A game of cat and mouse that fuels a deep, simmering fire within her. Agatha’s usual brazen self is gone, left with just a flirty exterior that she’s practically begging Rio to break through.</p><p>So Rio watches her. </p><p>She tracks Agatha as she parts the crowd, lighting up when she finds her cluster of friends. Her magnetic energy is back, beckoning Rio from across the room. Her friends angle toward her, pulled into her orbit. It’s this energy that Rio can’t help but be drawn to; she can’t help but move toward…</p><p>Then she sees it in the crowd.</p><p>A flash of red hair. </p><p>It’s familiar. But it’s been years since she’s seen that face. </p><p>The woman turns, her full face coming into view as she laughs with a group of upper-level residents. </p><p>Wanda Maximoff. </p><p>Years ago, it was rumored that Wanda was involved with an attending, Vis. A secret everyone knew but no one dared confront. And then everything collapsed. Vis was brought into the trauma bay after a car accident with a catastrophic head injury. Wanda had been told she couldn’t be on the case; she ignored every word. </p><p>She planted herself in the center of the chaos. </p><p>And when he died - even when everyone knew he was always going to die - her world folded in on itself. She fought the team, begging, pleading, demanding a different outcome. She clung to his body, threw herself over him. She demanded the staff continue, tried to prevent them from leaving the room. Security was called. Then the police.</p><p>She was eventually arrested, deemed to be trespassing and escorted off the premise. </p><p>And just like that, her career was over.  </p><p>“Wanda?” Rio asks as she comes up beside her. </p><p>Wanda turns, brightening as soon as she recognizes her. “Dr. Vidal!” She cheers, throwing an arm around Rio in a quick, familiar squeeze, as if the last time they say each other hadn’t ended in the trauma bay in handcuffs. “How are you?” </p><p>“Good,” Rio hesitates, still unsure of why she’s standing in a sea of residents like nothing happened. “I didn’t realize you still keep in touch with the residents.” </p><p>“Oh yeah,” Wanda laughs. “That’s how I know the hospital is still full of juicy gossip,” Wanda teases, taking a sip of her drink, her eyes twinkling. </p><p>“And here I thought you still took the cake for that one,” Rio shoots off before she can help herself. </p><p>Wanda laughs, entirely unbothered. Then she tilts her head, studying Rio. “I hear you’re dating an intern.” A slow grin spreads across her face. “Where is she?”</p><p>Rio swallows. “Who told you that?”</p><p>“The mouthy one,” Wanda gestures with her red plastic cup across the room. </p><p>Rio follows the line of her arm to where she points to Billy. Of course it was him. </p><p>That’s when Agatha decides to slip back to her, catching the line of Rio’s sight as she arrives. She snakes her arm around Rio’s. </p><p>There is no denying anything now. “Agatha, Wanda. Wanda, Agatha.” She gestures between the two of them. </p><p>Agatha offers a tight wave and a pursed lip smile before quickly dropping her eyeline to study a freckle on Rio’s arm. For a second, Rio swears something flickers across her face - Panic? Recognition? Shame? But it vanishes before she can examine it further. </p><p>“Wait,” Wanda says slowly, her head tilting to inspect Agatha further. “I recognize you.” </p><p>Agatha stiffens. “Not sure you do,” She shrugs, her eyes darting anywhere but Wanda’s face. </p><p>“No, no,” Wanda insists. “I swear I’ve seen you before.”</p><p>Rio tilts her head. “Agatha is one of the interns.” Then she turns to Agatha. “Wanda…” she pauses to phrase it delicately. “She used to work here.”</p><p>“The bar!” Wanda blurts out.</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks flare red.</p><p>“I met you at the bar!”</p><p>Rio feels Agatha go rigid beside her.</p><p>“And when was this?” Rio asks but she already knows she won’t like the answer. </p><p>“Christmas,” Wanda answers brightly. </p><p>“Christmas…” Rio draws out. “Right before you showed up at my front door?”</p><p>“Rio,” Wanda apologizes. “I had no idea, had I known…” she stumbles over her words. “And she came onto me.”</p><p>“Of course she did.”</p><p>The jealous flares through Rio, hot and sharp. It comes off her in waves, so much so that she’s sure Agatha feels it next to her.</p><p>“If you’ll excuse us,” Rio says through gritted teeth. </p><p>She seizes Agatha’s arm and drags her back through the crowd. Her fingers curl around her wrist, bruising into the skin.</p><p>Rio finds a narrow hallway, then a door. She pushes inside to find a bathroom, locking the door behind them.</p><p>“Rio, I didnt…” Agatha’s words are swallowed by Rio’s mouth. Her back hits the back of the door with a thud. Rio’s hands bracket Agatha’s hips, holding her in place. The kiss isn’t gentle - it isn’t even close. Her mouth is hot and unyielding, jealously twisting deep within her. She bites at her lips, crashes into her teeth. She kisses her as if she’s trying to erase any memory of Agatha with Wanda, laughing, touching her, trying to claim what isn’t hers. </p><p>Rio breaks for air, her chest heaving. She grabs Agatha’s chin, yanking it down to look at her. “Did you fuck her?” </p><p>Agatha’s lips curl. “You’re insanely hot when you are jealous,” Agatha growls and she attempts to yank her chin free, but Rio only grips harder. </p><p>“You didn’t answer my question,” her fingers bite into the skin on Agatha’s chin.</p><p>“Are you going to punish me if I did?” </p><p>Rio kisses her hard again, making Agatha gasp. She’s hungry, reckless with a desperation that screams mine. Agatha doesn’t seem to care. She meets her where she is - growling as Rio’s teeth bite into the skin of her shoulder, blossoming a bruise along her delicate skin. </p><p>“You are only making this hard on yourself sweetheart,” Rio purrs.</p><p>She yanks Agatha’s dress up, pooling it around her hips. And Rio drops to her knees. </p><p>Agatha yanks her leg up, throwing it over Rio’s shoulder from her place above her. Her heel digs into Rio’s back, urging her forward.</p><p>Rio inhales through her nose as she comes in contact with the black lace underwear, barely covering her.  </p><p>“Oh honey,” Rio’s tongue softly licks the lace at the crux of her thighs, just tasting the wetness gathered on the material. “You’re dripping.” </p><p>Agatha shivers. With a soft whimper, she tips her head back as Rio’s tongue delves in, pressing the lace into her but not quite penetrating. </p><p>“This better be all for me,” Rio groans. “Not her.”</p><p>Then Agatha actually whimpers. “Not her,” she murmurs. “Never her.” </p><p>Agatha shutters, the deep ache in her belly growing as Rio teases her - always above her underwear, flicking her tongue over where her clit is, pressing into her entrance just the tiniest bit - but never giving her what she truly wants.</p><p>“I need you,” Agatha moans, grinding her hips forward. “Your mouth, your fingers. Anything.”</p><p>Rio chuckles, the jealous beast in her soothed a bit at Agatha’s obvious desire for her. But still she wants to see Agatha’s desperation for her - raw and hungry and begging. </p><p>Rio licks up the length of her again, then sucks in the lace of her gusset, tasting Agatha’s arousal gathered there. </p><p>“Just touch me already!” Agatha hisses. She grabs into Rio’s hair, trying to force her forward onto her again. </p><p>So Rio quickly stands up, stepping back. Shaking her head as she moves in a tsk. </p><p>“Desperate girl,” Rio growls as she takes in the sight before her. She wants to commit it to memory - Agatha’s flushed cheeks, messy, tangled hair. Her dress is haphazardly bunched around her hips, underwear ruined. Her eyes, already dark and blown, go wide as Rio backs away from her.</p><p>“No,” Agatha whines. “Come back.”</p><p>“Ask nicely,” Rio teases. Agatha attempts to grab at her, her outstretched hand reaching forward, but Rio dodges her. </p><p>“Fine,” Agatha says. But then her eyes narrow and she sticks her tongue into her cheek. “I want you to fuck me. Hard. I want to feel nothing but your mouth and your fingers. I want to come so hard I forget my own name. Please. I’ll do anything for you.” </p><p>“Jesus Christ.” Rio could come right there from her words. “Turn around,” her voice grows dark, more commanding.</p><p>Agatha obligates, turning to face the bathroom counter. Her hands drop to the stone counter top, palms flat. </p><p>Without hesitation, Rio’s fingers pry her legs apart and a desperate sound rips from Agatha’s throat.</p><p>“So fucking needy,” Rio grates. “And I haven’t even touched you yet.”</p><p>Rio presses her whole body against Agatha’s back, sealing her in place. Her hand slides up under Agatha’s dress, tracing the skin of her stomach until her palm cups one breast through the thin lace of her bra. </p><p>She squeezes then pinches the peaked nipple through the material, hard enough to make Agatha cry out. </p><p>Rio huffs a dark laugh into her hair. “Someone is going to hear you.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice is thin with want. “I don’t care.”</p><p>“Don’t say a word,” Rio snarls. The command is barely out of her mouth before her right hand forces its way between Agatha’s legs. She drags the ruined underwear to the side then drags two fingers through her, gathering up her arousal as she goes.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes screw closed at the sensation, a new rush of wetness flooding between her legs. Her forehead drops forward, landing softly against the bathroom mirror. </p><p>“No,” Rio growls. “Don’t close your eyes. I want you to watch.”</p><p>Agatha obeys, her eyes snapping open to meet hers in the mirror. She nods, something between compliance and desperation. </p><p>Rio’s left hand fists into Agatha’s hair, grip tight at the roots. She yanks her head back until the long column of her throat is exposed.</p><p>“Good girl,” Rio breathes before her lips crash into the exposed skin. She bites down. Bruising. Marking. Claiming the territory that’s hers and hers alone.</p><p>“I want to mark you,” Rio sucks hard along her shoulder. “Brand you.” She bites again, enough to break the skin, the copper taste sharp on her tongue. “So everyone knows you are mine.” </p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha groans. </p><p>This time Rio’s laugh is mean. “Pathetic.” Her fingers slip deeper, stroking through the mess she’s made of her. “Fucking dripping for me.”</p><p>Agatha moans at the words, another surge of wetness leaking out of her.</p><p>Rio’s fingers hook into the lace, now soaked through, ruined. She curls her left hand to get a firm grip on the gusset, and yanks. The underwear rips at her hips, falling off her skin. Rio tosses the shredded material into the sink. </p><p> “Mother fucker,” Agatha groans through clenched teeth as Rio drags two fingers through her folds. She purposely avoids her clit. Doesn’t push in. She just traces her, the touch light. </p><p>“You need to be quiet,” Rio urges, although the party surges just outside the bathroom door. The music pulses, obnoxiously loud.</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes at Rio’s suggestion. Defiant. </p><p>So Rio withdraws. She pulls her fingers away and drags the slick up Agatha’s abdomen, leavening a glistening streak. </p><p>“No, no,” Agatha gasps. “Come back.” </p><p>“What do you say?” </p><p>“I’ll be quiet,” Agatha finally says, her voice cracking, “please fuck me.” </p><p>“Now was that was hard?” Rio chuckles. </p><p>With no hesitation, she sinks two fingers into her. Agatha lets out a loud, filthy sound as she thrusts down into Rio’s hand. Her hands tighten on the sink until her knuckles turn white.</p><p>Her cunt takes Rio’s fingers eagerly, a wet, greedy sound. </p><p>Agatha’s nails dig into the counter as Rio’s fingers slam into her. Deep and unrelenting in the way she fucks her. The wet sounds are obscene in the cramped bathroom, echoing off the tile. Agatha is not quiet about it.</p><p>“Fuck. Rio…harder!”  she gasps, her voice loud enough to carry down the hall. “I want to feel - “</p><p>Rio curls her fingers sharply, pressing into her front wall. Her rest of her sentence is cut off with a sharp cry.</p><p>“You said you would be quiet.” Rio growls against her cheek, her thrusts steady and punishing. </p><p>Agatha moans again - louder and hotter, her hips rolling against Rio’s hand. </p><p>Rio lifts her eyes to catch their reflection in the mirror. She’s watching Agatha fall apart in real time. </p><p>“You’re trying to get us caught,” Rio challenges. “Being that loud.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath stutters and she bites her lip. </p><p>“Wait,” Rio narrows her eyes at her in the mirror. “You want someone to hear us, don’t you?”</p><p>Agatha gives a tiny nod. </p><p>Rio exhales a dark laugh. “Thought so.” </p><p>Rio snatches the discarded underwear from the sink with her free hand and rolls the lace into a tight ball.</p><p>“Open,” she commands.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes go wide. </p><p>“You heard me,” Rio taps Agatha’s bottom lip with her thumb, the lace sandwiched between her other fingers.</p><p>Agatha obeys, her mouth dropping open. </p><p>“This will shut you up.” Rio shoves the ruined lace into her mouth, causing Agatha to gag slightly. </p><p>Agatha’s muffled cry is desperate. She’s clenching hard around Rio’s fingers now, slick dripping down her wrist. </p><p>“Look how fucking perfect you look,” Rio murmurs, nipping sharply at Agatha’s earlobe. With her left hand she yanks Agatha’s hair again, forcing her to look in the mirror. “You’re trembling dear.” </p><p>Agatha’s clit throbs against the palm of Rio’s hand, her whole body trembling with it. Her eyes flutter shut again as she tips toward the edge, just as Rio slows her fingers to an agonizing crawl. </p><p>“Look at me,” Rio snaps. “Or I stop.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyelashes flutter, heavy and fighting it. She’s so close she can barely hold her body upright. But she forces her eyes open. Rio is greeted by icy blue rings around pupils blown wide and full of want. </p><p>Rio’s fingers resume pounding into her relentlessly, dragging loud, wet sounds from her soaked cunt. </p><p>Agatha moans helplessly against the gagged lace. Her whine is high-pitched and wrecked sounding as the orgasm threatens to overtake her. </p><p>Rio lets go of her hair only to snake her arm around Agatha’s waist. She holds her up, catching her as her knees threaten to buckle. </p><p>In the mirror, Agatha looks beautifully ruined. Sweat clings to her brow, small bruises dot her neck and chest. Her chest rises and falls with frantic little gasps. </p><p>Agatha’s whole body is convulsing around Rio’s fingers as she scissors her open. Every muscle locks tight. She’s right there, on the edge, when Rio suddenly slams her palm against Agatha’s clit, grinding cruelly. </p><p>Agatha screams into the gag, a strangled high-pitched wail. Her thighs snap shut reflexively. </p><p>Rio pries them back open with her knee. </p><p>“Don’t you dare close your legs on me,” Rio snarls, dragging her fingers deeper, harder until Agatha’s vision starts to go white on the edges. </p><p>Agatha answers back with a helpless muffled sob, tears pricking the edge of her eyes in an attempt to hold herself back from coming. Her whole body shakes so violently with it that Rio has to pin her further into the sink to keep her upright. </p><p>Then Rio can hear the sounds of the New Years Eve countdown starting outside the bathroom door. The loud collection of residents starts shouting a countdown as the clock ticks closer to midnight. </p><p>“That’s it,” Rio grinding her hand again, fucking Agatha ruthlessly. “Make a mess of my hand like the filthy girl that you are. All for me.” </p><p>10…</p><p>9…</p><p>Rio adds a third finger into her without warning, stretching her open. Agatha’s eyes grow wide. </p><p>8…</p><p>7…</p><p>“I’m close…” Agatha mumbles, barely audible, barely coherent. </p><p>6…</p><p>5…</p><p>Agatha’s cunt tightens in a brutal clench, one long, ripping wave that knocks the breath out of her. </p><p>4…</p><p>3…</p><p>Agatha’s hips press into Rio’s hand, firm and fast. </p><p>2…</p><p>1…</p><p>“Happy New Year!” Erupts from the living room, cheers and laughter leaking into the small bathroom. At the same time, the heat coiling inside Agatha starts to break. Her eyes lock with Rio’s in the mirror. Instinct tells her to look away, to shut her eyes and escape the intensity of that gaze - but she doesn’t. </p><p>The amber eyes staring back at her are unexpectedly soft, warm…and loving. The sight undoes her.</p><p>Agatha comes with a muffled cry. Rio’s name tears from her throat, swallowed by the fabric still in her mouth. Rio’s arm reaches around her middle, their eyes still locked as Rio holds her upright through her shutters.  </p><p>Agatha is still trembling through the small aftershocks as Rio loosens her grip on her - just enough to give her space to breathe. Her palm stays anchored on her hip, steadying her as the last shivers run through her body. </p><p>She withdraws her fingers then reaches up and gently removes the lace from Agatha’s mouth, brushing her thumb across Agatha’s lips to wipe the dampness away. Agatha slides her dress back down her hips. </p><p>“You still with me?” Rio asks quietly, forehead pressing to the side of Agatha’s head. </p><p>“Barely,” Agatha whispers, leaning back into her. “That was…a lot.”</p><p>“I know.” Rio reassures her. “Come here.”</p><p>She turns Agatha around gently and pulls her into her chest, wrapping both arms around her. Agatha melts instantly. She buries her face in Rio’s neck, fingers clutching at the fabric of Rio’s vest like an anchor. </p><p>Rio holds her tight, swaying a little, grounding her. Her hands stroke slow circles on Agatha’s back, her voice soft. </p><p>“You’re ok,” she says. “I’m here.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath stutters again, this time with relief. She presses a small, shaky kiss to Rio’s shoulder. </p><p>“Don’t let go yet,” Agatha murmurs. </p><p>“Not planning to,” Rio whispers into her hair. </p><p>At those words, Agatha’s whole body settles into Rio’s. Their breathing slowly synchronizes as they hold each other. Then Rio lowers her head, lips brushing the corner of Agatha’s jaw. </p><p>“Happy New Year, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha turns her face toward her, eyes heavy but shining. “Happy New Year, Rio.” </p><p>—</p><p>Agatha spots him before he sees her. Ralph is sitting by the window of a small coffee shop, a paper cup in his hand. He’s looking out the window, not toward the door as she walks in. But instead his eye line follows some girl’s ass as she walks by. Figures.</p><p>She opens the door, forgoing ordering at the counter and slides into the seat opposite him without a greeting. </p><p>“I’m glad you agreed to meet with me,” Ralph says before offering a sad, but hopeful smile. “I just felt like we should talk.” </p><p>“Honestly, I didn’t really want to,” Agatha leans back, arms crossed as she rolls her eyes. “Rio thought it might be good for me. Growth or some shit.”</p><p>Ralph flinches a bit when she mentions Rio’s name. He tries to shake it off, but Agatha can tell he is still uncomfortable. “Did you want something to drink? I’ll buy,” he offers. </p><p>“I don’t plan on staying long,” Agatha reaches for her phone, checking the time before setting it back down on the table. “So what do you want?” Her voice is clipped. </p><p>“Evanora still thinks you’ll marry me. That you’ll come around. Just so you know.”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. “And what do you think?” It comes out sarcastic with a scoff. </p><p>He doesn’t answer. He just gives her a pleading look, then looks down as his coffee cup like it might give him more sympathy. </p><p>She almost feels bad for him, the way he looks at her - still hopeful. Like he’s waiting for her to say she changed her mind, like today might give him a different outcome. “Did you really love me?” She asks. </p><p>“I liked you enough that I thought we could make it work and the love would come.”</p><p>“It’s not supposed to work like that.”</p><p>His jaw tightens, fingers still on his coffee cup. “How would you know? You in love with that woman?” He spits.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t flinch. She just considers his words. “Yes,” she says softly. And it feels good. The world does implode around her like a dying star when she says it. It just feels…right. </p><p>Ralph’s face falls. “Does she know?”</p><p>“No.” Agatha shakes her head. </p><p>“Why haven’t you told her?”</p><p>Agatha lets out a long, loud sigh. “I’m just…I’m not ready yet.” </p><p>He huffs, something bitter behind the sound and narrows his eyes at her. “Seems you are no better off than me with then.” His gaze flicks down to her hands. “You sure you don’t want to give this another try?”</p><p>Before she can stop him, he’s reaching out. His fingers brush the back of her left hand, where her engagement ring should be. The touch is light, but Agatha jerks back instantly, like the touch physically burns her. She pulls her hands down under the table to rest on her lap. </p><p>Her eyes sharpen, realization setting in. “What did she offer you?” </p><p>His lips curl, bitterly amused that she caught on so quickly. “A hundred thousand dollars to get you down the aisle,” Ralph shrugs. “Honestly, I don’t know why she cares so much.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a dark laugh. “Because she can’t let her black sheep of a daughter ruin her perfect image. What would the hospital donors think? Her church group? No matter how much Evanora hates me, she can’t look like she failed as a mother. She just wants to make sure she looks good.”</p><p>“I take it that’s a no then,” Ralph says definitively. </p><p>“More like ‘over my dead body.’”</p><p>“I thought you might say something like that.” Ralph exhales before he reaches down, grabbing a folder out of the bag next to him on the floor. A bag Agatha didn’t even notice until this moment. “I didn’t want to have to do this, but you are leaving me no choice.”</p><p>He opens the folder to reveal several enlarged photos - Rio and Agatha leaving her apartment. Rio and Agatha driving to the hospital together. All taken at a distance. Like they were being watched.</p><p>“So what? These mean nothing. I spend time with her because she helps me study for boards.” Agatha pushes the photos back toward him. </p><p>Ralph throws her a look. Then slides the photos over to reveal the next few - Agatha on Rio’s lap in her car. Kissing her goodbye outside the hospital. And worse, Agatha pressed up against the building, Rio’s hands up her shirt.</p><p>Agatha’s throat goes dry. “Shit.”</p><p>“Let me just propose something. And don’t answer me yet. Just think about it. We get married, you live your life, secretly. Discreetly.”</p><p>Agatha stiffens then covers it by crossing her arms, trying to feign indifference. </p><p>Ralph continues. “We divorce after year, quietly. Your mom stays happy, no ruined image. Just ‘irreconcilable differences.’ No one is the wiser.”</p><p>“You think that’s going to work on me?”</p><p>“I do,” Ralph grins and this time it’s something more sinister. “I think you want to keep your residency spot. And she wants to keep her job.” His smile widens, no pretense of being nice, just all predatory now. So yeah, I do.” </p><p>Agatha doesn’t respond. Not yet. She slowly gathers the photos in her fingers, tapping them onto the table to gather them in a neat stack. </p><p>“You know what’s wild, Ralph.” Her smile curling into something more sinister. “I used to think you were harmless. Spineless, sure. Eager to please. But harmless.”</p><p>Agatha can see him try to muster up enough courage for a comeback. But she shuts it down instantly. </p><p>“Burn them. Frame them. Shove them up your ass for all I care.” She shoves the photos back toward him. </p><p>Ralph bristles, anger starting to bubble up.“You’re in over your head with her, you know that right?”</p><p>“Rio or my mother?” Agatha laughs sharply. </p><p>“Evanora will crucify you both.”</p><p>Agatha just shakes her head. “You don’t get it. I’m not scared of you. And I’m not scared of her. Not anymore.” Agatha’s eyes drop to the folder of images, Ralph’s hand splayed across the folder protectively. “And yeah,” she swallows. “I love her. And I haven’t told her yet because I want the words to matter. And because for once, I’m choosing the timing of my own damn life.”</p><p>With that she stands, grabbing her coat and throwing it over her shoulders. She turns, the material swishing behind her like a cape. </p><p>“And Ralph?” She turns one last time, leaning toward him just enough that he feels her warning. “Next time you try to pick on someone, choose someone who’s actually afraid of losing.”</p><p>Then she lifts her middle finger up and stomps out. </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p> </p><p>— </p><p> </p><p>Agatha has been stewing over her encounter with Ralph for days. </p><p>First, she was filled with pure anger. She debated showing up at his house several times, thought about trying to throw a punch (something she’d never done), or kicking him in the groin (something she’s definitely done). </p><p>Then sadness. She tried to pretend she didn’t have tears in her eyes every time she recalled the photos of her and Rio’s private moments being violated.  </p><p>Then she started contemplating revenge. She thought of all the ways she could kill Ralph (or Evanora) and make it look like an accident. She was a doctor after all; there are lots of good options - high dose insulin injected between the toes, accidental overdose of a tricyclic antidepressant (which she knew Evanora took), poisoning with death cap mushroom (which Agatha learned from one of Rio’s botany books).  </p><p>Ultimately those all felt too risky. </p><p>She has been meaning to tell Rio about it, she really has (the blackmail, not the possible murder). </p><p>But since the NYE party, life has been swallowing them whole. Rio got slammed with a week of nights, Agatha dove headfirst into board prep, and their worlds barely brushed. Passing kisses exchanged at shift change. Feeling each up in hospital hallways. A few exhausted texts. Not nearly enough.</p><p>Today she’s going to pull Rio aside and tell her everything - Ralph and Evanora conspiring to blackmail both of them. Today needs to be the day. Agatha can’t take the pressure in her chest any longer. </p><p>She’s sure Rio isn’t going to run, right? Not after how far they’ve come. How much they’ve sacrificed for each other. Not after the way Rio has chosen her, again and again - even when Agatha pushed her away. </p><p>But every time that feeling settles, when Agatha feels like they have their footing on solid ground - it’s like Evanora is suddenly there again - a sniper in the periphery, waiting for the perfect shot. </p><p>Agatha wants to tell Rio she loves her. She’s ready for that too. But in the wake of the photos, she’s worried it will seem more like a Hail Mary than a confession of her feelings. </p><p>So Agatha bites the skin along her thumb nail as she sits next to Rio in the conference room on Monday morning. The entire team is here, so it’s not quite the right place to drop a relationship bomb on her. But still, she can break the ice a bit. </p><p>When Agatha looks over to Rio’s computer screen next to her, she sees her eyes are glued ahead of her. Unmoving. Staring. Rio hasn’t typed for five minutes. </p><p>As she watches her, feelings ready to burst through, she notices something. </p><p>Rio looks wrong.</p><p>She’s more distracted than usual. Off-kilter somehow.</p><p>Her fingers hover too long over the keyboard. Her jaw flexes. Her eyes keep sweeping the hallway like she’s watching, waiting for something. Agatha has no idea what. </p><p>Agatha watches her for a moment, worry prickling. </p><p>“Rio?” She asks gently, probing.</p><p>Rio nearly jumps out of her skin at the intrusion, even though Agatha’s voice was barely above a whisper. </p><p>“You good?” </p><p>Rio’s lips curl into a tight, tense smile. “Yeah,” is all she replies back, the tone too tight. </p><p>“Want to head up to the floors with me?” Agatha asks, hoping to gauge her reaction. </p><p>“Sure…” Rio stands. She seems to pause for a moment, calculating what she needs to bring with her - laptop, coffee and stethoscope.</p><p>They walk toward the elevator bank. </p><p>“Are you okay?” Agatha tries. “You seem jumpy.”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Rio says, stabbing the elevator button harder than necessary. “Just tired.”</p><p>Agatha sucks in a breath before leaving against the back wall of the elevator. Rio says nothing. </p><p>As the elevator hums to life, Agatha’s mind is rattling through their interactions, their texts, trying to find what went wrong. </p><p>Instead of landing on a solution, her stomach just lurches, a nervous pit forming. </p><p>Now her idea to tell Rio she loves her doesn’t feel so brave after all. </p><p>—</p><p>Something feels wrong about today. </p><p>Rio notices it the moment she steps through the hospital doors. The air feels heavy with something unspoken. </p><p>Rio can’t name it, but it’s there like an electric hum. The hospital is alive with it, unseen but running through the walls. </p><p>It settles into her bones, bringing an uneasy feeling deep into her chest. </p><p>She feels it again as she gathers her patient list. She glances through the names, nothing unusual stands out. Rio takes a deep, but shaky breath and opens her laptop to click through her charts. </p><p>She keeps searching for the source of the feeling - like her soul can reach out and capture the source of her anxiety. She constantly checks her pager, swearing she felt a vibration that never comes. Her eyes dart to every corner of the hallways like she hears Evanora heading her way, only for there to be no one there. </p><p>Instead, the hospital hums on - the day extremely ordinary. And somehow that makes it worse. </p><p>Agatha doesn’t seem to notice at first. Not when she drops into her seat across the conference room table. Not when she slides Rio an iced coffee she picked up for her before the shift. And certainly not as she winks at Rio from across the conference room table. </p><p>Truth be told, Rio isn’t sure this feeling isn’t about her. Maybe it’s the underlying tension of barely seeing each other for the past week. Or the lack of sex from being too busy. Her sharp, selfish craving to get her alone, beneath her. Maybe it’s something else entirely. </p><p>But Rio doesn’t have the energy to battle it today. She just lets the feeling slowly wash over her, consume her thoughts until she feels like a wallowing ball of sludge - and it’s only 8am.  </p><p>Then Agatha starts poking at it - jolting her out of her thoughts and into the present. Rio can tell she’s worried about her, worried about them, and Rio can do nothing to reassure her. </p><p>When Agatha asks if she’s ok, Rio doesn’t know how to answer her - how do you explain that you think your entire day might crumble because you sense it might? It sounds insane to say out loud. </p><p>But then half the day goes by and nothing falls apart. </p><p>Does she still feel like she’s a walking piece of glass, waiting to crack into a million pieces at any moment? Yes. </p><p>Does it take three times as much energy and concentration as usual for Rio to get through her day? Also yes.</p><p>And does Agatha stare at her the entire morning, her eyes a mix of concern and what looks like anticipation (for what, Rio has no idea). A resounding yes. </p><p>Still Rio rounds on all her patients, discharges three of them and has time to talk to Chloe in her room.</p><p>Chloe is more upbeat than usual, which she’s attributing to the new chemotherapy actually working. </p><p>Rio isn’t sure that’s the case but she’s happy to see Chloe in such high spirits, her energy level improving. She even requests ice cream, which Rio fetches from the doctor’s lounge for her, just to make sure it’s the good stuff. </p><p>Chloe’s renewed sense of energy starts to thaw the freezing feeling in Rio’s chest too. She can breathe a little deeper, think more clearly. </p><p>Rio then finds a moment to get some charting done. But first, she steals a soda and graham crackers from the patient nourishment room, then settles into one of the physician computer stations lining the nurses’ station. She chats with a respiratory therapist about another patient, makes small talk about the weather with a student nurse. And 45 minutes later, most of her work is done and the day is looking like she might even be done with work early. Maybe she can sneak in dinner with Agatha at the hospital cafeteria; or her place if they have the time. </p><p>Rio fetches her phone out of her white coat pocket and sends Agatha a text making plans for the evening. Agatha replies seconds later and soon they have plans for tacos and margaritas after work. </p><p>Whatever feeling Rio thought she felt earlier must have been unexpected anxiety or exhaustion or…</p><p>The intercom suddenly crackles overhead, the sound echoing throughout the hallways. </p><p><em>Code blue, room 1401. Code blue, room 1401.</em></p><p>Rio drops her pen, watching the plastic hitting the desk like it’s in slow motion. </p><p>She feels her stomach drop, her heart beat tick up and her palms start to sweat just slightly. </p><p>“Fuck! No, no, no.” Rio yells loud enough that several nurses turn around. “Fuck, it’s Chloe,” she lowers her voice, mumbling to no one in particular. </p><p>She takes off down the hall, fast steps quickly turning into a full on run. She bangs through the door to the stairwell, taking them two at a time until she reaches the oncology floor.</p><p>The room is already packed with people - nurses, techs and laboratory personnel seeping onto the hallway. </p><p>Rio pushes through the crowd, making her way deeper into the room. </p><p> </p><p>And for the first time in her career, Rio freezes. Standing there at the foot of the bed, she sees Chloe. Her small frame looks even smaller, swallowed whole by the bed beneath her. Her gown has been shoved haphazardly down her chest, the skin beneath it already blue and mottled. </p><p> </p><p>One of the nurses is frantically performing chest compressions, pounding against her ribs. Rio can hear small cracking noises heard as they snap beneath her palms. </p><p> </p><p>“Dr. Vidal,” somewhere she hears someone calling her name. “Dr. Vidal!” There is more yelling now and she snaps back into focus.</p><p> </p><p>“Dr. Vidal! What do you want to do?” </p><p> </p><p>“Epi’s in?” Rio asks.</p><p> </p><p>“Last round one minute ago,” a nurse calls from her position next to the crash cart. She checks the list in front of her where she has tracked all the medications given so far.  </p><p>“And has someone called Frank?” Rio asks into the crowd. </p><p>“Who?” Comes the question from someone in the crowd.</p><p>“Her husband! Jesus, someone call her husband! Tell him to come right away. Don’t tell him she’s coding. Just get him here!” Rio can hear her voice fraying, her words coming out shakier than she intends.</p><p>The respiratory tech rhythmically squeezes the ambu bag. The plastic tube lodged deep in Chloe’s throat, breathing for her. Rio watches her chest rise and fall artificially. The motion is too stiff, too fake. </p><p>“Pulse check,” she calls, her voice thin. </p><p>Hands freeze. Silence falls over the room. </p><p>Rio presses two fingers to Chloe’s carotid artery. A nurse rests a Doppler along her groin.</p><p>Nothing. </p><p>Rio feels nothing but the vibration of her own pulse hammering back at her. </p><p>She makes quick eye contact with the nurse and who shakes her head to confirm the same. </p><p>“Resume compressions,” Rio commands.</p><p>For a brief second, the only sounds in the room are the near constant thump along Chloe’s chest, the silicone crinkle of the ambu bag. </p><p>“What the hell happened?” Rio shouts to no one in particular. “She was fine this morning! She was fucking improving!” </p><p>“I think it was the surge,” Rio turns to see Chloe’s nurse, eyes rimmed red. </p><p>Fuck. The surge. How could she have overlooked that? That final rally, that burst of energy patients get right before they crash. Rio was so blinded by her fondness and compassion for Chloe, she never saw it coming. </p><p>And now here she was, watching Chloe die in real time. </p><p>“How long since the last epi?” Rio asks. </p><p>“Two minutes.”</p><p>“Prep another 1mg then,” her lips form a thin line. “I want it given as soon as we hit three minutes from the last dose.” </p><p>The drawers of the crash cart open and clang closed again. Trash litters the floor around them - saline flushes, syringe caps, gauze, plastic wrap. </p><p>“Rio, it’s been 45 minutes already,” the charge nurse points out quietly. Rio tries not to notice the use of her first name; the attempt to appeal to the more human side of her. </p><p>“Have we given bicarb yet?” Rio asks, ignoring the charge nurse’s insistence. </p><p>“No,” another voice, maybe the pharmacist, points out. </p><p>“Then give bicarb.”</p><p>Rio can feel the fatigue of the room. The audible exhales of several staff members. The way their motions are slower, their frantic state calmed just a bit. All of it screams one thing: we know it’s over and we are just going through the motions now.</p><p>But Rio isn’t done.</p><p>Not yet. </p><p>“Push epi,” she calls out. </p><p>“We’ve already given seven doses.”</p><p>“I. Don’t. Care.” Rio says through gritted teeth. “And where the hell is Frank?” She yells toward the door. </p><p>She sees a chaplain stick his head in the doorway. “He’s ten minutes out.”</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>Deep down, Rio knows it’s over. But she isn’t ready to stop yet. </p><p>More epinephrine. More compressions. </p><p>They run out of medications in the crash cart and have to send an intern to run to another floor to grab more. Nursing students start taking over CPR as the nurses exhaust themselves. </p><p>And then someone lets her know Frank is outside the door. </p><p>Rio swallows hard, mentally preparing herself for what’s coming. </p><p>She slows the room down. She excuses any staff not actively giving medications or CPR. She straightens the sheet over Chloe’s body, until only her chest - now an ugly grey-blue color - is visible. </p><p>“Continue CPR,” Rio says quietly. </p><p>And then she brings Frank in. To an outsider it seems cruel - letting the family watch those final moments. But it’s important. It not only lets him know they did everything they could, but it helps bring finality to those moments. </p><p>His eyes are wide when he enters. Too wide. He walks slowly toward Chloe’s feet, hesitantly, unsure where to stand. </p><p>Rio watches him take in the sight before him, the IV lines snaking out of her arms, plastic tube shoved down her throat, breathing for her. An exhausted nurse huddles over Chloe’s chest, compressing again and again. A futile effort to get her heart started again.</p><p>“Frank,” Rio starts carefully. “We’ve been trying for over an hour. Her body is too fragile.”</p><p>He doesn’t respond. He just watches them at work with a stunned, hollow expression.</p><p>“I’m afraid there is nothing more we can do,” she places a slow, careful hand on his shoulder. </p><p>He doesn’t move. He doesn’t acknowledge her presence at all.</p><p>Rio meets the eyes of each member of her team. One by one. A silent consensus. She gives a subtle nod. They know what it means.</p><p>Everyone slowly withdrawals their hands. </p><p>CPR stops.</p><p>The tech stops squeezing the ambu bag. </p><p>They turn off the machines. </p><p>The breaths stop. The beeping stops.</p><p>It’s quiet. </p><p>Rio steps around Frank, placing her stethoscope in her ears. Her fingers tremble against her will.</p><p>She draws it up to Chloe’s chest, feeling the tears prick her eyes as she does.</p><p>She places it along Chloe’s ribs, where her heart is.</p><p>No sound comes back to her.</p><p>“Time of death: 15:28” she calls out. A slight pen scratch is heard as someone scribbles it down.</p><p>She walks back to Frank, ready to tell him to take his time saying goodbye. </p><p>But he’s already moving. </p><p>“No!” He suddenly yells. “That’s it? No, no, no!”</p><p>He runs to Chloe’s side. “You have to keep trying! You can’t give up like this!”</p><p>And then he places his own hands on her chest, frantically attempting CPR. His hands push desperately on her chest, sobs wracking his shoulders. </p><p>No one else moves.</p><p>“Please,” he begs. “Someone help me please.” </p><p>He keeps pushing. His moves are small, desperate. And useless. </p><p>The staff doesn’t move. </p><p>“Frank,” Rio murmurs, stepping closer. She places a hand on his arm, attempting to still his movements. </p><p>“Dr. Vidal,” he chokes. “We have to keep going.”</p><p>“We tried,” she begins, her voice firm. “She’s dead.”</p><p>The word is brutal. It sounds harsh. She knows it does. But in that moment, she has to say the words.  Not “gone.” Not “in a better place.” <em>Dead</em>. He has to understand. It’s over. </p><p>His head snaps toward her, his nostrils flare at her words.</p><p>“You said she was going to get better!” He shouts, jabbing a finger hard enough into her shoulder that she stumbles a bit. “You made promises like some kind of god!”</p><p>Rio sees a nurse step up, closer to her side, ready to defend her from Frank. Her hand shoots up to stop her. </p><p>“I was hopeful Frank,” Rio says sternly, not backing down. “I never guaranteed anything.” </p><p>“You’re not a saint, Doctor,” he spits. “You’re just an angel of Death!” </p><p>And he collapses forward onto Chloe’s body, curling around her. He weeps into her gown, the noise loud and cruel. </p><p>Rio steps back to give him space. Her team does the same.</p><p>No one says a word as they slip out of the room, closing the door behind them. </p><p>Rio doesn’t stop to talk to her team. She doesn’t begin charting or go to the debrief. </p><p>She just walks as fast as her feet will physically carry her - she cuts through the oncology wing, down the stairwell and out a side exit. The door slams behind her. </p><p>The cold winter air instantly slaps her in the face. </p><p>She finds herself in a back courtyard, hardly used and long since forgotten. Dead leaves pile in the corners. The plants are overgrown and tangled over the sidewalk. An old picnic table sits neglected in the center of it all, cracks broken through the benches. </p><p>Rio presses her back to the brick wall of the hospital and exhales a long, shaky breath - then chokes on it, a sob ripping out before she can stop it. </p><p>She cries for Chloe. </p><p>She cries for Frank. </p><p>She cries over the words he hurled at her - because they land too harsh, too truthful. </p><p>She cries for herself because she couldn’t save anyone today. Not Chloe. Not Frank. And right now, not even herself. </p><p>It must be ten minutes that Rio stands there. Maybe twenty. All she knows is she’s out there long enough that the wind cuts straight through her coat and scrubs, numbing her skin and stinging her eyes. For  a second, she thinks about how there must be a storm coming. Not that she cares. </p><p>Instead she thinks about how she feels like she failed Chloe. How her body is being zipped into a transport bag, already on its way to the morgue. The morgue that is much colder than whatever Rio feels out here in the hospital courtyard.  </p><p>She wishes she had a cigarette right now. She’s regretting that she gave up the habit years ago. Maybe she should start keeping them in her white coat pocket for moments like this. Something to hold. Something to stop the trembling in her hands. </p><p>Maybe it could keep the tears at bay. </p><p>“Rio.” </p><p>Agatha’s voice, cautious and small, threads through the cold air behind her. </p><p>Rio doesn’t turn to face her. “How did you know where to find me?”</p><p>“I heard the overhead page. I figured you were sentimental enough to go to the same place I crashed out during my first code.”</p><p>Rio scoffs. </p><p>“And Alice saw you,” Agatha adds. </p><p>“That’s more like it,” Rio manages to muster up a soft smile as Agatha comes to stand beside her. Not touching. No crowding. Just there. A quiet, steady presence that she’s suddenly grateful for.  A grounding force. </p><p>Agatha waits. Not asking. Not prying. Just giving her space to breathe without feeling alone.</p><p>And God - Rio could kiss her for it. Or fall apart for her. Or both. </p><p>Instead, for now, she whispers, “Chloe fucking died.” The tears start to fall again, silently down her freezing cheeks. </p><p>“Shit,” the way Agatha says it, it sounds like an apology. </p><p>Rio nods, leaning back further into the wall until her head rests on the brick. </p><p>Agatha scoots sideways until her shoulder is just brushing Rio’s. Her fingers reach out, wiping a tear that’s gathered along Rio’s jawline. </p><p>“Rio?” Agatha asks, her voice small. “If Evanora would have approved the chemo, would she have lived?” </p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>A beat.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Rio wipes the remaining tears with the back of her head. Her voice is less shaky now. “I don’t know. It probably would have bought her more time. At least time to realize what was happening. Be more comfortable. Maybe even time to say goodbye.”</p><p>Rio can feel Agatha tense next to her. Her fists clenching and unclenching at her words.</p><p>“It’s like she did this to her,” Agatha grates. “Indirectly,” she continues. “But she still affected her life. And she doesn’t even know. She has no fucking idea.”</p><p>“She wouldn’t care if she did know,” Rio adds.</p><p>Agatha takes a long inhale, considering her words. “Yeah, you’re right,” she says finally. </p><p>They stand like that. Shoulder to shoulder. Silent but soaking in each other’s presence just the same.</p><p>Agatha starts to shiver slightly next to her. She tugs her white coat closer around her, trying to ward off the cold. Out of the corner of her eye, Rio sees her look to the door a few times, hinting she wants to go inside. But she doesn’t make a move toward it. </p><p>“Come ‘mere,” Rio opens her arms and Agatha settles into her chest. They both wrap their arms around each other - an embrace of warmth for Agatha, comfort for Rio. </p><p>After a few minutes, Agatha mumbles into her shoulder, “Rio.” </p><p>“Hmm?” Rio rests her cheek along Agatha’s hair. </p><p>Agatha doesn’t pull back to meet her gaze, but Rio can feel her straightening her back, like she’s mustering up the courage to say something big. </p><p>“We need to talk.”</p><p>Rio sucks in breath. “Fuck,” she mutters. She instantly drops her arms from Agatha’s shoulders and takes a step back. That’s not what she expected. It could not be a worse time for Agatha to come up with some relationship altering drama. And Rio doesn’t have the energy to fight her, not tonight. “Do we have to do this right now?”</p><p>Something flashes in Agatha’s eyes. Sadness maybe. Or defeat. </p><p>And then in a second, it’s gone. The look is replaced with indifference as Agatha rolls her eyes. </p><p>“Suit yourself,” Agatha says lightly, inspecting her nails like she’s debating a suitable polish color. “Guess you don’t want to know about the blackmail.” </p><p>She lets the words linger, deliberate, before she turns and starts to walk away.</p><p>“Wait, what?!” Rio blurts, her head snapping up. Her fingers reach out instinctively, grasping onto Agatha’s wrist to stop her from retreating further. </p><p>Agatha freezes but doesn’t pull away. Her eyes flick down to Rio’s hold on her wrist, then back up to meet her amber eyes.</p><p>“Ralph.” She drops his name casually. Almost bored.</p><p>Rio stiffens, waiting for the next shoe to drop.</p><p>“Evanora hired someone,” Agatha continues. “Don’t know who, but they have pictures of us.” The underlying implications of her words aren’t lost on Rio.</p><p>Rio’s stomach drops. She takes a step forward, guiding Agatha closer to her at the same time. “Agatha…” her tone is full of sympathy. </p><p>Agatha’s expression remains cool, contained - like this hasn’t been eating at her all day (it has). “Of course Ralph is willing to make them disappear.”</p><p>“In exchange for?” Rio’s jaw tightens, like she knows what’s coming. </p><p>“A year of marriage.” </p><p>“A year!” Rio practically screams. “Are you fucking kidding me? Agatha, that’s insane” she closes the distance between them now to search Agatha’s face. “You can’t…don’t tell me you are considering it.” </p><p>Agatha scoffs at her. “I told him to shove it,” she gives Rio a look like that should have been obvious. But then, quieter, she adds, “But it got me thinking.”</p><p>Before Rio even had time to process her words, Agatha continues, “I’m done. With all of it.”</p><p>Rio’s face falls. </p><p>Here it comes. </p><p>It’s always something - a breaking point, a pressure point that boils over - something that makes Agatha bolt. And with Evanora still looming, still plotting - it becomes easy. Too easy to run. </p><p>Rio feels herself already bracing; already mourning the quiet thing they built as it splinters in her hands. </p><p>She tells herself not to be surprised. She should have known better than to believe this thing could withstand. Evanora’s hooks are too deep in Agatha. As much as she has tried to break free, there are tiny fissures she hasn’t healed. </p><p>Rio takes in a slow, steady breath. She already feels wrecked and whatever Agatha is about to say will finish the job. She’s already starting to imagine the bottle of wine she will open when she gets home - something to numb her. </p><p>Then she feels it. </p><p>Agatha’s fingers close around her wrist - warm and firm and yanking her closer until her body is centimeters away from Agatha’s. </p><p>Rio startles out of her spiral and looks at her.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes aren’t distant and cold like she expected. They are soft. Open. That familiar, impossible blue now glossy and rimmed red with tears that haven’t fallen yet. </p><p>“Don’t,” Rio chokes out. “I just want to walk away before I hear it. Let me do that, please.”</p><p>“Rio…” Agatha’s voice sounds like a plea. “I can’t stay here. It will kill me.” </p><p>Her voice drops again, so dangerously low that Rio has to strain to hear her. “There is a residency spot in Boston. Jen found it for me.”</p><p>Suddenly, there is a roar in Rio’s ears. </p><p>“No,” Rio moans but she doesn’t know if she’s saying to herself or Agatha. “We can’t - I can’t do this again.” Her voice fractures. “Why does feel like I always end up here? Trying to convince you not to leave the moment things get hard?” </p><p>“You aren’t hearing me,” Agatha tightens her grip, tugging her closer. She tilts Rio’s face up with her other hand then brings both hands to her cheeks - just holding her there. </p><p>“I’m not running,” Agatha says fiercely. “Not this time.”</p><p>Her thumbs brush beneath Rio’s eyes, grounding her there. </p><p>“I’m asking you to come with me.”  </p><p>Rio inhales sharply. The roar stops. The world stops. It narrows to this person, right in front of her, asking for her world to narrow to just the two of them. It’s perfect. “You don’t mean it.” It sounds too good to be true. </p><p>“I do. I realized you are the only thing that’s ever been real in my life. Not manipulated by Evanora or paid off. Just…genuine. As cheesy as that sounds. So…just think about it.”</p><p>“I’ll go,” Rio says as soon as the words leave Agatha’s mouth. </p><p>“I said to think about it. I don’t want you to rush into this.”</p><p>Rio gives her an empty laugh. “It isn’t rushing for me, Agatha. I already told you I’d move to Alaska if that’s what it took. This isn’t me chasing you,” Rio continues softly. “This isn’t me rescuing you from something. This is… real.”</p><p>Because with Agatha, there is always a magnetic pull. Once Rio is close to her, she is pulled onto her orbit. She can’t, she won’t say no to her. And she doesn’t want to. </p><p>Agatha closes her eyes before dropping her hands from Rio’s face. She shoves them in her pockets, a physical barrier slowly being created. Her face drops to something far more vulnerable that Rio has seen before. “You don’t get to blame me later. If this goes wrong…”</p><p>“It won’t,” Rio cuts her off.</p><p>“If this goes wrong, you don’t get to turn around and say I ruined your life.”</p><p>Rio exhales. “I’m not afraid of choosing you. Or choosing us. I’m afraid of not.”</p><p>“Jesus,” Agatha mutters like she isn’t used to words that sincere. “I…” she stops, the words stall somewhere in her throat. Rio can see it bubbling up, threatening to break through the surface. Somewhere deep down, Rio knows what she wants to say. She wants to shake her and scream at her to just say it - But she fears it will scare her, send Agatha running in the other direction. She’s been too open, too vulnerable with her already. Rio knows she has to tread carefully. It’s like trying to coax a baby deer out of hiding. </p><p>That’s the thing about that drug that is Agatha Harkness. When she asks you to uproot your life to move across the country for you, you drop everything at her feet to follow. Rio would ruin herself a million little times if it meant staying close to her. </p><p>This time, it’s Rio who reaches for her, cupping Agatha’s face, gentle but sure. </p><p>And then Agatha is speaking, blurting out her feelings before she can overthink it. “I love you.” </p><p>Rio’s hands stiffen along her cheeks. “What did you say?” Agatha knows full well she’s toying with her. </p><p>“You heard me,” Agatha scoffs. “Don’t play coy.” Her words are caught somewhere between playful and defensive. </p><p>“I really didn’t,” but Rio’s smirk gives her away. </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. “I love you, okay? Now don’t make a big deal out of it.” </p><p>“Oh I’m absolutely going to.” Rio leans in to give Agatha a small, gentle kiss along her cheek.  </p><p>“You knew I did, didn’t you?” Agatha pulls back to look at Rio fully as she says it.</p><p>Rio nods. “I was just waiting for you to say it yourself. I wasn’t going to push you.”</p><p>“See, that’s why I love you.”</p><p>Rio’s expression softens completely. Her smile reaches her eyes, the skin crinkling a bit in the corners. “I love you too.” </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p> </p><p><b>Last time on "Can't be a Good Girl:” </b></p><p>“You knew I did, didn’t you?” Agatha pulls back to look at Rio fully as she says it.</p><p>Rio nods. “I was just waiting for you to say it yourself. I wasn’t going to push you.”</p><p>“See, that’s why I love you.”</p><p>Rio’s expression softens completely. Her smile reaches her eyes, the skin crinkling a bit in the corners. “I love you too.” </p><p>—</p><p>Agatha leans in to kiss her. </p><p>It isn’t hurried. Agatha’s mouth brushes Rio’s first, soft and testing. It’s not enough for Rio, her hand coming up to cradle Agatha’s jaw and deepen the kiss immediately. She can feel Agatha smile against her lips before running her tongue across her lips. Rio grants her access, sinking into her, her hips pressing into her.</p><p>Of all the times Rio has kissed her, this one feels different. There is no urgency sharpened by secrecy, no impending doom or loss. This has real meaning behind it. </p><p>Rio’s hands settle again at Agatha’s waist, finger tips slipping underneath the hem of her scrub top. She urges her closer, feeling the warmth of her skin against the cold evening air. It’s a reminder that this, <em>them</em> together - is real. Agatha moans softly into her touch. The sound is enough to drive Rio wild, to have her wanting to rip her shirt clear off her, even her at the hospital, in public. </p><p>Agatha pulls back, her breathing faster, chest heaving just a touch. By now the sun has dipped low in the sky, the chill in the air worsening with each passing minute. </p><p>“Tell me I don’t have to go back inside,” Rio groans as the reality of why she’s out here in the first place seeping back in. </p><p>“You absolutely do,” Agatha takes both Rio’s hands in hers, squeezing. “But mostly because my ass is about to freeze off.”</p><p>“Will you at least come over?” Rio asks.</p><p>Agatha smiles at her, squeezing her hand. “Of course. Order us some Mexican food too.” </p><p>The prospect of the entire night with Agatha, drowning in her until the day fades into something distant and manageable sounds perfect. Especially in the wake of how busy they’ve been. The last prospect of any alone time (and sex) was New Year’s Eve. </p><p>Now as Rio settles into the driver’s seat of her car, the emotional toll of the day weighs on her again.</p><p>Only a handful of cars remain in the parking lot, mostly employee parking, but a few still dot the visitors’ lot. She wonders if Frank is still here; if he’s sitting somewhere hollowed out by loss, unsure of what comes next. </p><p>The streets are eerily quiet as she drives, a fog settling low on the road. Soft snowflakes fall on her windshield and she slows her driving down as she turns, to ensure her car won’t slip. </p><p>It takes her longer than usual to make it home. When she finally does, the cold air bites at her skin even more as she exits the car and she heads straight to the warm shower.</p><p>Rio turns the faucet all the way up, letting the water run hot enough to feel like it’s scolding her skin. She sinks down onto the tile floor, leaning back against the wall as the steam fills the room. Water pours off her steadily, washing away the residue of the day. </p><p>She imagines the sorrow of losing Chloe rinsing off her skin, spiraling down the drain until it’s gone. </p><p>It’s a strange emotional stalemate -  her chest caught in a constant tug-of-war. Guilt for letting herself feel something, happiness, with Agatha tonight. But grief, still raw and insistent for everything she couldn’t fix. </p><p>By the time the water begins to run cold, she’s made a decision. Okay She doesn’t want to feel anything else tonight. To become so blissfully numb until she can tackle a new day. </p><p>And there is one way she wants to do that - with Agatha. </p><p>She climbs out of the shower and into soft pajamas. She promised Agatha she’d get Mexican food - so one DoorDash order later, her kitchen counter is filled with almost every menu item they offer. </p><p>But her stomach hasn’t settled from the day. She picks at the tortillas, nurses a beer and watches the clock. </p><p>The end of Agatha’s shift comes and goes with no response from her. </p><p>The house is quiet apart from the refrigerator humming, the heater clicking on and the whine of the wind outside. Sitting on the couch turns into laying down, phone in hand, doomscrolling until she’s curled on her side. </p><p>Rio has never been good at waiting. At doing nothing. At sitting with the helplessness of knowing exactly where Agatha is but not what she’s doing. </p><p>At 9pm, her phone rings.</p><p>“Got caught up at work?” Rio asks as soon as she picks up. She honestly expected Agatha to come over earlier, her shift ended at 7pm. But she also knows how the hospital can get busy when you least expect it. </p><p>“Worse,” Agatha sighs into the phone. “Have you looked outside?”</p><p>Rio sets her beer down on the coffee table and stands, brushing a few crumbs off her clothes and onto the carpet before she walks over to the living room window. She pulls back the curtain and instantly the cold starts seeping in. Her backyard is covered in a blanket of thick white snow, with more falling.</p><p>“How bad is it?” Rio asks, then walks to the front of the house to survey the street. </p><p>“Night shift can’t get in. They haven’t plowed the roads yet,” Agatha sounds slightly irritated, like the weather is so inconsiderate of her love life. “All in-house residents have to stay overnight to cover for them.”</p><p>Rio wants to stomp her feet like a child having a tantrum. </p><p>“Not fair,” Rio pouts. </p><p>“I know.”</p><p>Rio considers braving the snow storm to go get Agatha. Either by foot or by car. </p><p>“Don’t even think about it,” comes Agatha’s voice before Rio has a chance to think of the answer. </p><p>“Get out of my brain,” Rio laughs.</p><p>“I’m serious,” Agatha says. “Stay put. I’ll make it up to you later. I have an admission right now.”</p><p>The line clicks dead before Rio can protest.</p><p>Around 1am, her phone rings again. Rio doesn’t have to look at the caller ID to see who is calling. </p><p>“I was trying to get some sleep, you know,” Rio rolls over in bed as she answers, settling onto her side.</p><p>“Must be nice,” Agatha sounds exhausted. “Snow storm brought a bunch of traumas.”</p><p>The idea makes her wince - the car accidents, the heart attacks from attempting to shovel snow. It brings her right back to the code tonight - to Frank huddled over Chloe’s lifeless form. She had just felt the weight of it lifting, only to be dragged back under again. </p><p>Instead, she tries to focus on the sound of Agatha’s voice, letting the sound of it settle over her. </p><p>Rio can hear movement on the other end - the rustling of fabric, the shifting of her weight. </p><p>“Where are you?” She asks.</p><p>“I stole the attending call room,” Agatha’s smirk is practically audible through the speaker. “You know, the one we…”</p><p>“I remember,” Rio cuts her off. The memory surfaces rapidly. It feels like a lifetime ago, the first time she had Agatha beneath her, her mouth between her thighs. Agatha tying her up with her stethoscope. It feels almost dangerous to think about it now. </p><p>“You’re thinking about it, aren’t you?” Agatha’s voice drops to a low, teasing whisper. </p><p>“No,” Rio swallows hard, trying to regain control. “I was going to ask if Jen is mad you stole her call room.”</p><p>“Please. That psycho never sleeps on night shift. She sits in the conference room with all the lights on like some sort of vampire.”</p><p>“Wouldn’t a vampire prefer the dark?”</p><p>“Whatever,” Agatha brushes her off. “You want to talk about Jen or about how you are thinking about our first night together?”</p><p>Rio’s pulse accelerates. “I…” Her breath stutters before she can stop it. She rolls onto her back on the bed, staring up at the dark ceiling, suddenly too aware of her own body - of the growing warmth in her abdomen, the heat pooling in her core.</p><p>“I’m not thinking about anything. I’m trying to sleep,” Rio says, but it lacks conviction. </p><p>“Liar,” Agatha’s tone drops, the words coming out more intimate. </p><p>Rio squeezes her thighs, feeling the world narrow to the dark of her bedroom, to Agatha’s voice in her ear. </p><p>“Where exactly are you?” Rio asks. </p><p>“In the bed. Lights off. Door locked.” Agatha’s words come slow and needy. </p><p>“And?”</p><p>Agatha exhales heavily, “And one finger inside.”</p><p>An involuntary moan escapes past Rio’s lips. </p><p>“There it is,” Agatha growls. “Show me how wet you are for me.”</p><p>Rio swallows. “Show you?” Rio feels the challenge. One she knows she will lose. But she doesn’t care. Agatha is being bold again. Reckless in the hospital. And it feels good. </p><p>“Take a picture,” Agatha commands. The dominance in her tone makes Rio’s stomach drop. </p><p>Rio pulls the phone away from her ear before shoving her left hand into her pants, past her underwear. With her right hand, she snaps a quick photo of the motion then sends it to Agatha. </p><p>She can hear the tapping of Agatha’s fingers on the other line as she places the phone back to her ear. </p><p>“This proves nothing,” Agatha scoffs. “Take your hand out then send me a proper pic.”</p><p>Rio’s hand is still in her pants when she says it, fingers lightly tracing through her folds. When she removes it for the camera, wet arousal glistens on her fingertips. </p><p>She presses send. </p><p>“That’s more like it,” Agatha groans. Rio can hear movement again and a small grunt from Agatha. It’s followed by a soft sigh that makes her shiver. </p><p>The realization hits. “Are you touching yourself?” Rio’s tone drops low, like someone might hear her, even though she’s alone in her own home.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t answer. The only sounds coming through the speaker are the clicking of the onscreen keyboard and small, faint background movements.</p><p>Rio’s phone beeps with an incoming notification.</p><p>It’s Agatha in bed, her scrub pants around her ankles, two fingers deep inside herself.</p><p>It’s pornographic. </p><p>And it’s for her.  </p><p>“You know what I miss?” Agatha’s voice is breathy, intimate. </p><p>“Hmm?” Rio can hardly focus on Agatha’s words, her eyes fixated on the glistened curls between Agatha’s legs in the photo. It’s accompanied by the sounds of Agatha sliding in and out of herself. </p><p>“You riding my strap,” Agatha moans. “You…” her breath catches. “And how pretty you look with my cock down your throat.”</p><p>At her words, Rio thrusts two fingers into her cunt, sliding easily through her wet folds. Her hips thrust into her hand, eyes screwed shut. In seconds, the feeling is overwhelming. She’s too hot. Too turned on. She kicks the covers off her legs. </p><p>“I miss how obedient you get,” Agatha continues, almost conversational. Rio doesn’t care, her voice alone is getting her off. “How well you listen.”</p><p>Another squeak of the bed is heard, then Agatha’s muffled moans. Rio figures she flipped over onto her stomach. She imagines her thrusting into the bed now. Hips grinding up and down while she fucks her fingers. </p><p>“Rio,” she whines. “Touch yourself.”</p><p>“Already there, my love.” </p><p>At the nickname, Agatha whines. “My love,” she whispers back. “How many fingers?”</p><p>“Two,” Rio responds, the sound is rough, filled with arousal. </p><p>Agatha bites sharply at her, “Add another.” </p><p>Rio hesitates, her need already overwhelming. She’s coiling tighter, hips still rising off the bed with each thrust. She removes her fingers, drawing out the pleasure longer as she rubs small and slow circles on her clit. </p><p>Agatha senses her pause. </p><p>“Did I stutter?” She bites. </p><p>God, Rio wishes she could see her. Touch her. Watch as Agatha’s eyes grow darker, her cunt wetter as Agatha dominates her. She wants Agatha pounding her into the mattress until she can’t walk without thinking of her. </p><p>A pleading, broken noise breaks through Rio’s throat. </p><p>“Focus. Answer the question.” </p><p>“No,” Rio breathes. “No, you didn’t.” </p><p>“Good,” Praise laces Agatha’s words. “Add. Another.”</p><p>“Yes.” Rio hisses as three fingers sink inside her. “This…this isn’t fair,” Rio says, trembling as she thrusts. </p><p>“Oh honey,” Agatha is not being endearing. She’s cruel. “I already came once to the thought of you eating me out. Right before I called. I thought of your tongue deep inside me. My come coating your chin. The way you eat like you are starving for me.”</p><p>Rio almost comes right there. Her cunt clenches around her fingers, desperate for more. </p><p>“Now…” Agatha stutters, her own need becoming more evident through the phone. “Say my name.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio cries out. </p><p>“Fuck.” </p><p>“Agatha,” she says hungrily. </p><p>“Again.” Agatha moans. Loudly. “So good. So good for me.”</p><p>“God,” Rio runs fast circles on her clit, pressing harder as she does. “Agatha. I’m going to come.” </p><p>“Jesus, fuck. Almost there. Fuck. Oh god.” Agatha screams as she comes, the sound muffled into what Rio assumes is a pillow. </p><p>Rio jerks again before she’s splintering. Pleasure courses through her, her entire body tensing as the waves pass over her. She thrusts her fingers - once, twice more to coax tiny shockwaves through her as her orgasm slows. </p><p>As she comes down from her high, she hears Agatha’s heavy breathing in the speaker.</p><p>“I hope no one heard you,” Rio pants, still gasping for air.</p><p>“Like I care.”</p><p>Rio laughs. </p><p>“Hey,” Agatha whispers softly. “Will you stay with me?”</p><p>“Of course,” Rio settles onto her side, a chill settling over her. She pulls the covers back over herself, tucking her chin under the fuzzy blankets. </p><p>It’s still and quiet for a few minutes before Rio hears calm, steady breathing on the other end. She doesn’t hang up. She just lets the rhythmic sound lure her to sleep. </p><p>—</p><p>It’s four days later when Rio stands in front of Agatha’s apartment door, arm poised to knock. Rio barely taps her knuckles on the wood before it swings wide open. She’s prepared for Agatha to greet her, but it’s Billy’s face staring at her, looking mildly disappointed. </p><p>“I thought you were our dinner,” he steps to the side as he says it. Then calls out toward Agatha’s bedroom. “Your girl is here.” </p><p>Rio’s breath catches at the remark. It’s so unguarded, easy.</p><p>She steps further into the warm apartment just as Agatha steps out of her bedroom. She looks so comfortable in a pair of sweatpants and a crop top. Her hair is loose and down, a rare sight for Rio to see given it’s always tied up at the hospital. She wants to run her fingers through it. </p><p>“Well,” Billy clears his throat. “I’ll let you guys know when the food is here.”</p><p>He retreats back to his room and Rio realizes Agatha and her have been standing ten feet apart, just staring at each other.</p><p>It’s the first time they’ve seen each other since the courtyard confessions; the roads having finally been cleared enough to safely travel and their schedules clear. </p><p>Rio closes the distance first. She doesn’t rush it. She doesn’t overthink it. She just steps into Agatha’s space and cups her face like it’s the most natural thing in the world. The kiss is unhurried, like muscle memory. </p><p>Rio exhales into it, her hands settling on Agatha’s hips. She uses the motion to push her slightly backward, deeper into Agatha’s room. She tilts her head, deepening the kiss. Her fingertips start digging into the flesh as her tongue dips into Agatha’s mouth. Agatha’s hands fist into the front of Rio’s jacket, tugging her closer. </p><p>“Hi,” Agatha murmurs into her lips.</p><p>Rio responds by shrugging off her jacket and letting it fall to the floor.</p><p>“Hi,” she echoes, smiling. She goes to close the distance again, her hand threading under Agatha’s shirt, ready to take it off.</p><p>Agatha catches her wrists gently and peels her hands away, lacing their fingers together instead. She tugs Rio toward the bed. </p><p>“I want to show you something,” she says, bright with excitement. “So don’t be mad, I know it will be months before we move, but I’ve been looking at apartments.” </p><p>“Oh, umm…” Rio starts, hesitantly. Agatha just smiles at her, squeezing her hand to reassure her. Rio doesn’t say anything further. </p><p>Agatha climbs onto the comforter where her laptop is already open, several tabs pulled up. Rio follows, settling close, hovering over her shoulder as Agatha clicks onto the first listing.</p><p>Maple hardwood floors stretch up against floor to ceiling windows. A view of the city is seen through the glass. Agatha scrolls through photos of the bedrooms, carefully not to linger on the price, although Rio sees it anyway. She feels her stomach drop. </p><p>“This one gets great light,” Agatha says. “Huge living room windows. And a decent sized kitchen.” She clicks through the photos of stainless steel appliances and a quartz countertop. </p><p>“Mmhmm,” Rio hums, lips pursed. </p><p>Agatha glances at her. “Okayyyy,” she says, clicking to the next apartment. Photos show this one is smaller. It has exposed brick along the living room wall. It’s a walk-up on a historic tree lined block, a coffee shop at the end of the street.</p><p>“Well,” Agatha says hopefully. “This one is walking distance from the hospital. I thought that might be nice since I don’t have a car.”</p><p>“It’s going to be too loud,” Rio says, her tone stern and decisive. “We will hear the ambulances all night.”</p><p>Agatha sighs but keeps scrolling. “Well what about this one? It is charming.” </p><p>Rio shuts it down immediately. “That’s code for old and run down.” </p><p>Agatha snorts. “I was thinking we could get two bedrooms, maybe three.”</p><p>“Three?” Rio reacts. </p><p>“That way we could each have an office. Or share an office and have a guest room.” Agatha types the new parameters into the search bar. The page refreshes, showing dozens of apartments scattered across the city. </p><p>Agatha hovers the cursor over the listings. She clicks through a few, bookmarking the ones she likes. She’s waiting for Rio to comment, to show any interest in the endeavor. </p><p>Rio gives her none. </p><p>Agatha closes the laptop. The sound is loud and final in the quiet of her bedroom.</p><p>She turns toward Rio, really looking at her now. The tight set of her jaw. The way she chews at her fingernail. </p><p>“Okay,” Agatha turns to her. “What’s going on?” </p><p>Rio exhales. </p><p>While Agatha has been picking out dream apartments and scouting neighborhoods and coffee shops, Rio has been doing something else entirely. Scouring job boards, emailing recruiters, making calls. </p><p>The part of the move that she thought would be easy turned out to be nothing of the sort.  </p><p>It’s been a week of unanswered emails, calls going nowhere. The growing awareness between them that this part - her part - hasn’t come together yet. </p><p>As soon as she thinks she’s making headway, she gets ghosted. She has a feeling she knows why - they dig into her past at this hospital and there is Evanora (or one of her minions) putting a bad taste in their mouth. And here she thought Evanora would be delighted to be rid of her. </p><p>Without Rio’s job, they are dead in the water. Agatha can’t afford rent, Rio can’t afford to leave this job. </p><p>Feeling like she can’t provide for Agatha, can’t take care of her when she needs her the most, is slowly eating away at her. </p><p>“I haven’t found a job yet, Agatha.” She lowers her voice. “I know it hasn't been that long but there are only so many hospitals in the area. And it doesn’t mean I’m not going with you. I am. But if we have to live off your resident salary for a bit…”</p><p>“We will make it work.” Agatha sounds so optimistic. She’s sure in a way she hasn’t been before. </p><p>Even though she’s not sure that’s true, Rio reaches for her, her hand settling on Agatha’s lower back, pressing warm and steady through the fabric of her shirt. It’s a quiet promise that she is here; that she is ready to figure it out. </p><p>Agatha pauses and leans back into her touch. Her head turns to rest on Rio’s shoulder. </p><p>“We’ll figure it out,” Rio says softly. It’s a promise she isn’t sure how to keep yet, but it’s an honest one.</p><p>Agatha studies her face for a moment, then gives a small decisive nod. “Ok.” </p><p>A sharp knock on the front door interrupts them. </p><p>Billy clears his throat pointedly as he passes the bedroom doorway on his way to the front door. “Food’s here,” he calls out as he walks past them. </p><p>“Do you two ever keep your hands off each other?” He asks, returning with two plastic bags full of food.</p><p>Rio and Agatha rise from the bed, abandoning the laptop to meet him in the kitchen. “Do you ever stop interrupting us?” Rio shoots back, not even pretending to be apologetic. </p><p>“I might have liked you better as our attending.”</p><p>“You won’t have to deal with me for much longer,” Rio says easily. She smirks and gives Agatha a quick wink. </p><p>Billy’s hands freeze mid-motion, one hand on a carton of Chinese food. He looks at Rio. Then Agatha. Then back again. </p><p>“You just moved in,” he says slowly. “And you are already leaving to shack up with her?”</p><p>Agatha looks more than amused. “Worse. We are moving to Boston.”</p><p>“Wait,” he mutters. “Are you dropping out? Becoming her sugar baby?”</p><p>Rio snorts. “Jen found her a residency spot. She might have to become my sugar mama if I don’t find a job.”</p><p>It seems like a joke. Lighthearted and fun. But it leaves the taste of bile in her mouth. </p><p>She doesn’t miss the way Agatha’s jaw tightens, just a fraction, despite her earlier bravado. The way her grip on the fork sharpens as she shovels orange chicken onto her plate, a little more aggressive than necessary. </p><p>Rio knows that look by now. It’s fear - of being unmoored, of starting over somewhere new, of wanting something badly enough that she can’t think of how badly losing it would hurt. </p><p>Without thinking, Rio presses a quick kiss to her temple, meant to be soft and reassuring. Agatha gives her a tight smile, her breathing still stiff and forced.</p><p>Billy watches them both between bites of chicken. “You two are kinda disgusting,” he says with his mouth full. </p><p>The sentiment makes Agatha smile before she reaches for the glass on the table, finishing off the glass of water in three gulps. Rio realizes she hasn’t gotten one of her own, just sharing Rio’s without asking. </p><p>It’s a quiet comfort that she stores away for later. The thought of always getting an extra big glass of water at the apartment, <em>their</em> apartment for when Agatha steals hers. </p><p>“I almost forgot to tell you!” Billy interjects on her thoughts. “You don’t have to worry about those pictures anymore by the way.” </p><p>Agatha and Rio both snap their heads toward him at the exact same time. </p><p>Rio’s spine goes rigid at the harsh reminder of the blackmail. Fear flashes across her face, unguarded before she tries to shoo it away. </p><p>Agatha, on the other hand, looks delighted. </p><p>“What did you do?” Rio asks, slightly alarmed.</p><p>Billy laughs.</p><p>“Oh my god, did you kill him?” Agatha’s eyes shine a little too bright when she says it. </p><p>“You think I’m capable of murder?”</p><p>“No,” Rio starts automatically.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha says at the same time, completely serious.</p><p>He hops up from the kitchen table and grabs his backpack where it’s slung over the back of the chair by the door. He unzips it, rummaging around until he pulls out the thick folder and slaps it onto the table. </p><p>Agatha and Rio lean forward. </p><p>“How?” Rio asks, not wanting to finish the question.</p><p>“I stole them,” he says proudly. “Your straight and narrow fiance isn’t so straight after all.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a low whisper. “No way.” </p><p>“Did you…” Agatha starts, wiggling her eyebrow. </p><p>“Eww no,” Billy grimaces. “He’s totally not my type.”</p><p>Rio laughs. She doesn’t want to kill their vibe but, “I’m sure he has copies.” </p><p>“Took care of that too.” </p><p>Billy jumps up again, fishing something else ject from his backpack. </p><p>“His laptop,” he presents proudly, dropping it on the table. </p><p>Agatha’s chair scraps back suddenly, loud against the old wood floor. She disappears into the bedroom and shuts the door.  </p><p>Rio hesitates to follow her before…the crash makes her jump. </p><p>Agatha is back, small hammer in her hand. She doesn’t hesitate. The blow caves the metal in, glass shattering beneath it. </p><p>Agatha looks at Rio, her eyes wild and unhinged. “Looks like your present came in handy after all.”</p><p>She swings again. </p><p>Rio doesn’t move to stop her. </p><p>—</p><p>Two months. </p><p>That’s all Agatha has left in his hell hole. </p><p>After that, everything will be better. She keeps telling herself that. Like a promise. </p><p>Agatha tells herself that as Jen drones on about sodium-potassium pumps and the role of activating medications. She throws her a snide comment about how she learned this in medical school and earns herself a scowl. </p><p>She tells herself she’s almost free as Jen then makes her present a mini-lecture on diabetic medications and weight loss. When Jen asks her where she got her information, she tells her Rio taught her. She enjoys the flash of anger that crosses Jen’s face a little too much. </p><p>And even though Rio hasn’t landed a job yet, Rio still reassured her, promised her that she’ll move anyway. Worst case scenario, she becomes a doc-in-box at the local Walgreens until she finds something more permanent. </p><p>The point is, Rio and her will be together. Living in their own place. Exploring restaurants and parks in Boston on the weekends. Building something that belongs just to them. </p><p>Agatha presses the elevator button, summoning it to the hospital lobby where she waits. </p><p>It’s all Agatha can think about.</p><p>It’s all that keeps her going.</p><p>Right now, nothing can get her down.</p><p>Except…</p><p>“Agatha.” </p><p>The elevator doors slide open to reveal her mother. </p><p><em>Shit.</em></p><p>Agatha considers turning away and letting the doors close as she heads back toward the conference room. Pretend she never heard her name. </p><p>“Agatha,” Evanora’s bony hand shoots out, stopping the doors. “I know you can hear me.” </p><p>Agatha turns to plaster on her fakest smile. A pharmacy tech passes by, nodding toward them politely as he goes. </p><p>She steps inside the elevator. At least here in the confines of these four walls, Evanora can berate her in private. </p><p>“What are you even doing up here?” Agatha asks through gritted teeth. “I thought the hospital hallways were beneath you.”</p><p>“Oh they are. Filthy places,” Evanora looks around with open disgust. “But I heard you are moving.” </p><p>Agatha draws a small breath, bracing herself. “Where did you hear that?” </p><p>“Oh stupid girl. Don’t you know I know everything that goes on in my hospital?” Evanora gives a thin smile. “Including your move and your foolish attending running to follow you.” </p><p>Agatha scoffs. “And here I thought you would be happy to be rid of me.” She reaches forward and presses a floor button - any floor. She doesn’t bother looking. She just wants off this ride.</p><p>Evanora shakes her head. “I wish I could be. But you are making this hospital, the residency, look bad. People keep asking me why we can’t even retain the CEO’s daughter.”</p><p>“Make up something,” Agatha snaps. “Tell them you kicked me out. I don’t care. I’m still leaving.”</p><p>The doors open and Agatha steps out as quickly as she can. </p><p>She looks up just as Evanora’s smile turns to something sinister. </p><p>“I’m thinking I might call…” Evanora snickers. “Boston is it?” </p><p>The doors begin to close.</p><p>“I’m sure they would love to know what a <em>gem </em>of a resident they are getting.” </p><p>“Fuck you,” Agatha says just as the doors seal shut. </p><p>She stands there for a moment, staring at her reflection in the metal. </p><p>Her eyes burn. Tears press close. She tries to blink them back but starts to fail. </p><p>So she turns the opposite direction, down the hospital hallway. </p><p>Her pager starts beeping almost immediately and Agatha ignores it. It’s probably Jen, harassing her about an admission. </p><p>All she wants is Rio. </p><p>To see her. To hold her. To cry about how much her mother hates her and how badly she wants to be done with this hospital - with all of it. </p><p>Her pager buzzes again.</p><p>Then her cell phone. </p><p>Damn, Jen is relentless today. </p><p>She walks faster, head down, avoiding the nurses’ station until she spots a supply closet, a large one. She slips inside, moving all the way to the back, tucked between shelves of gauze and saline until she’s out of sight. </p><p>Agatha sinks to the floor and folds in on herself, forehead resting on her knees. </p><p>Her phone buzzes again. </p><p>She tells herself she can ignore it for a minute more. Just until the nausea fades and the anger passes enough for her to breathe normally again. </p><p>She can hear the hospital chaos outside the walls. Someone shouts, a metal tray clangs to the ground, a door slams. Footsteps rush past the supply closet door but it never opens. </p><p>Good. Let them deal with the mayhem; she just needs quiet. </p><p>Her pager buzzes again. </p><p>She huffs, blowing out her cheeks in frustration. </p><p>So much for finding peace. </p><p>With an exacerbated sigh, she pulls the pager from her white coat pocket, ready to fling it across the room. </p><p>Instead, she looks down. </p><p>Not Jen.</p><p>A hospital wide message. </p><p> </p><p><em>Code silver</em>.</p><p> </p><p>She mentally runs through the list of codes: code blue, code pink, code yellow. She can’t recall a code silver.</p><p>She grabs her cell phone to look it up and instead finds a flood of messages from Rio: </p><p> </p><p><em>Agatha</em></p><p><em>Agatha! </em></p><p><em>Where are you?</em></p><p><em>What floor are you on? </em></p><p><em>Are you safe?</em></p><p><em>Answer your phone! </em></p><p><em>Dammit Agatha, answer me now! </em></p><p><em>FUCK AGATHA PLEASE  </em></p><p> </p><p>Her breath catches. </p><p>Her phone starts ringing immediately. </p><p>She answers on instinct, forcing a thin, shaky laugh. But inside her heart is racing. Something feels wrong. The noises outside the closet are louder now, more frantic. </p><p>“What’s so important that you had to text me so many times?” She tries to sound casual, hoping the frenzy is just manufactured in her head. </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio says her name like a prayer, full of tension and pleading. She whispers into the speaker, “Are you ok? Are you safe?”</p><p>“Of course I am,” Agatha says automatically. “What’s going on? Why are you whispering?”</p><p>“Where are you?” Rio presses. “What floor are you on?”</p><p>Agatha freezes and looks around the supply closet. Identical shelves as every other floor. No windows. No signage. </p><p>“I…I don’t know,” she admits. “I hit a random elevator button. I didn’t even look.” </p><p>On the other end of the line, Rio goes very still.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio whispers. Agatha can hear the shaking in her voice. “Listen to me, don’t leave that room.”</p><p>Agatha scoots backward until her shoulders hit the wall. </p><p>Another sound filters through the ceiling - a sharp pop, like fireworks, muffled as it comes from another floor. </p><p>Still it makes her flinch. </p><p>“You’re starting to scare me, Rio,” she says quietly. “What is a Code Silver? Like…a mass casualty?”  </p><p>“No.” Rio swallows hard enough that Agatha can hear it through the phone.</p><p>“There’s a gunman in the hospital.” </p><p>—<br/><br/></p>

<p>The day started out like any other.</p><p>That’s always how it is, isn’t it?</p><p>The worst day of your life never starts out the worst. It starts out normally - bitter coffee, stale pastries and bright, fluorescent overhead lights. </p><p>Rio’s rounds run long. A patient’s potassium is low for seemingly no reason and she orders the replacement - which they promptly refuse to take. A nurse flags her down to ask about a patient who looks fine but doesn’t feel right, Rio spends an extra 20 minutes in their room checking and rechecking until she’s satisfied. </p><p>She signs three patient charts, orders about 50 labs and jokes with a resident about how the cafeteria somehow made the eggs worse. </p><p>That’s the last moment that her day, her life, will ever be normal again. </p><p>Rio is in a patient’s room, leaning back against the counter while a sweet, elderly woman explains why she didn’t think potato chips counted against her low-salt heart failure diet. It’s then that her pager, clipped to her scrub pants, starts beeping. </p><p>She silences it, as she usually does, content on checking the message later. </p><p>It beeps again. </p><p>Rio purses her lips, before finishing her sentence and glancing down, already half-expecting a medication question or a family request. </p><p>Instead, the screen glows with two words. </p><p><em>Code Silver</em></p><p>Her blood turns to ice in her veins. That…that can’t be right, can it? It has to be a drill, an error. Anything else.</p><p>As soon as the noise starts outside the patient room, she knows the rest of the hospital heard it too. Doors slam shut, locks clicking. Patient beds are pulled away from windows. Lights are turned off. </p><p>Without a word, she smiles sweetly at her patient, walking to close the blinds of her room. </p><p>“What’s going on?” Her patient asks, hearing the commotion. </p><p>“Just a drill, ma’am,” Rio is calm, steady. She doesn’t shake. </p><p>Until, Agatha. </p><p>The thought hits so hard, it almost knocks the air out of her lungs. Nausea comes at her like a wave crashing to shore as she realizes she doesn’t know where Agatha is or what she’s doing. </p><p>She pulls out her phone, thumbing a quick message to ease her fears.</p><p><em>Agatha.</em></p><p>She presses send. She waits less than a minute to send a second text. </p><p><em>Agatha! </em></p><p><em>Where are you?</em></p><p>No reply. Her heartbeat picks up a bit. </p><p><em>What floor are you on?</em></p><p>She’s just busy, she reassures herself. And hasn’t seen her pager. </p><p><em>Are you safe?</em></p><p><em>Answer your phone! </em></p><p>When there is still no response, her throat starts to feel tight, her heart rate too fast.</p><p><em>Dammit Agatha, answer me now! </em></p><p><em>FUCK AGATHA PLEASE </em></p><p>Fuck it, she’s going to call her. </p><p>“What’s so important that you had to text me so many times?” Agatha answers immediately. Rio knows her well enough to recognize fake bravado. </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio pleads. Her voice drops to a whisper, trying not to scare the patient in front of her. “Are you ok? Are you safe?”</p><p>“Of course I am,” Agatha responds. “What’s going on? Why are you whispering?”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t know. At least that means she’s safe, unaffected by whatever prompted the code. </p><p>“Where are you?” Rio presses. “What floor are you on?”</p><p>Rio doesn’t get a response. Not immediately anyway. She can hear Agatha shuffling around on the other end of the line. </p><p>“I…I don’t know,” Agatha finally says. “I hit a random elevator button. I didn’t even look.” </p><p>A chill runs through Rio. That could mean anything. She could be as close as the supply room down the hall or as far away as four floors. </p><p>“Okay,” Rio whispers. She hears the tremor in her own voice this time and doesn’t bother hiding it. “Listen to me, don’t leave that room.”</p><p>A distant pop rattles through the phone, causing Agatha to gasp. Rio freezes, listening for the sound on her end. Nothing. Her floor remains silent - so they aren’t in the same place.</p><p>“You’re starting to scare me,” Agatha says quietly. “What is a Code Silver? Like…a mass casualty?”  </p><p>“No.” The nausea is mounting now, bile rising in her throat. “There’s a gunman in the hospital.”</p><p>“I…” Agatha starts, then stops. Her breathing comes more rapidly through the speaker now, voice shaking.</p><p>Rio can’t sit idly by, hoping a phone call is enough to sustain them both through this ordeal. </p><p>She has to protect her, she has to shield her. She has to…</p><p>She has to find her. </p><p>“Listen to me,” Rio says. “I need you to stay low. Crawl if you have to. Go to the door and just barely crack it. You need to tell me what floor you are on.”</p><p>A shaky breath on the other line. “Ok, ok. I can do that.” Rio hears movement on the other end. Then a pause.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“I’m here.”</p><p>“I can’t crawl and hold the phone. I have to set it down.”</p><p>“Don’t hang up,” Rio says immediately. “Just leave it on. I’ll stay.” </p><p>Time stretches on for what feels like an eternity. Every nerve in her body feels exposed, flayed open like she’s the one on the operating table this time. </p><p>Rio takes the time to pull a chair closer to the patient’s bed and leans down. </p><p>“Listen to me very carefully,” she whispers. “There is an active shooter in the hospital. I don’t know where. I don’t know who.”</p><p>The woman’s eyes widen, terror blooming across her features.</p><p>“If anyone comes in this room,” Rio continues, “you do not move. You lie every still. You play dead. Do you understand me?”</p><p>She nods slowly. Her trembling hands clutch the blanket around her. “I have to call my family…” </p><p>“Do what you need to do as quietly as possible.” </p><p>The phone crackles again with Agatha’s voice. “Rio?”</p><p>Oh thank God.</p><p>“I’m here,” Rio sighs in relief. “I’m here Agatha.”</p><p>“I’m on the third floor.” </p><p>She’s two floors below her. Rio can’t risk the elevator, it’s likely locked down by now anyway. Main stairwells will be locked as well.</p><p>But the back stairwell, the one they use to access the sixth floor - that one might be their saving grace. </p><p>Rio exhales. “It’s going to be ok.” She doesn’t know that.</p><p>“We’re going to be ok,” she continues. She doesn’t know that either.</p><p>Rio knows the rules, she’s been through the training. <em>Stay put, secure the unit, reassure the patients. </em></p><p>She doesn’t care. </p><p>Rio eases toward the door, peering through the narrow window. The units is so still - the lights are low, staff huddled in back rooms and closets where they hide silently. </p><p>She can’t sit here idly and wait. </p><p>“Dr. Vidal?” Her patient whispers from behind her. “What are you going to do?”</p><p>“I’m going out there. I have to save someone.” </p><p>Rio’s hands start sweating as she eases the door open. She slips only her head out, scanning the hallway inch by inch. </p><p>Nothing. </p><p>It’s eerie actually. </p><p>The hallway is dim, the only light now filtering through the windows from the outside. </p><p>She slips out the door, pressing her back to the wall. The purpose is two-fold: to become smaller, less of a target and to give herself a chance to attempt to calm.</p><p>Her heart is pounding so hard, she swears she can hear her pulse in her ears. Her breathing is erratic - too fast and she risks hyperventilation just standing here. </p><p>She squeezes her eyes shut, risking a moment of darkness behind her eyelids in an attempt to not allow her own body to give her away.</p><p>Breath in - 1, 2, 3, 4. </p><p>Hold - 1, 2, 3, 4. </p><p>Breath out - 1, 2, 3, 4 </p><p>As she slows, one thing becomes more apparent. Not a sound can be heard on the entire floor. </p><p>There is no beeping of monitors, clicking of keyboards, or doors opening and closing. Gone are the near constant conversations and movement of people in and out. </p><p>If she didn’t know any better, it would simply feel like the middle of a night shift. Like the world is fast asleep around her. </p><p>Against her better judgement, Rio bends and slips off her sneakers, setting them down slowly on the floor. She pads down the hallway toward the stairwell exit sign in her socked feet. Her footsteps are now silent. </p><p>Just before the door, she pauses, hand poised on the handle. </p><p>She listens.</p><p>No sound comes from the other side. </p><p>She eases the door open. It gives a soft click, still far too loud in her ears and she slips inside, pulling it closed just as carefully. </p><p>The stairwell is even darker than the hall - no windows or lights to illuminate the concrete that she now descends. She takes each steps tentatively, listening, assessing as best she can as she moves. </p><p>She has no idea where the gunman is. Or who it is. She assumes the cops or swat are on their way. Perhaps the entire time is close to being resolved already.</p><p>No such luck. As she descends to the last step - her foot slides. She hits something slick, pitching forward. Her heart lurches, adrenaline feeling like it suddenly shoots through her. Her fingers reach out blindly, grabbing the railing just before she hits the ground. </p><p>Her socks are wet. Warm. </p><p>She looks down. </p><p>Blood pools beneath her, spreading slowly across the concrete. It seeps into the fabric of her socks, clinging to her skin. </p><p>She doesn’t want to look up. She already knows nothing good awaits her. </p><p>But Rio forces her gaze anyway. </p><p>Alice. </p><p>She’s slumped over against the wall, head hanging low. Dark blood, almost black, saturates the concrete beneath her. The sticky mess isn’t cake onto the floor or drying in the cool air - it’s new. Fresh. </p><p>“No, no. Please God,” Rio chokes on her own words. She slaps a hand over her mouth, trying to muffle the scream that threatens to escape. </p><p>Hot, wet tears blur her vision. A mix of anger and overwhelming grief. But she forces herself to bend down to check for a pulse.</p><p>Faint. Thready. But there. There is skin warm to the touch, beneath her fingertips. </p><p>“Alice, talk to me honey. Where were you hit?”</p><p>“Arm,” comes her hoarse whisper.  </p><p>Rio grasps the left shoulder of Alice’s white coat, now saturated with blood. And she rips. The wet fabric falls away. Underneath is a clear wound, still oozy a large amount of blood. Rio carefully lifts Alice’s arm to inspect it. </p><p>The pain shoots through Alice and she lets out a gut-wrenching cry. </p><p>In that instant, a sound echoes above them. Or maybe below them. Rio’s ears deceive her and she can’t tell if it’s the building groaning or footsteps heading closer. She thinks she hears sirens in the distance, but maybe it’s just wishful thinking. </p><p>The tension has Rio’s body locking up, betraying her where she sits. Involuntary shaking starts takes over - her hands, her arms, even her teeth chatter uncontrollably. </p><p>Fuck. </p><p>She sees her fingers shaking where she holds Alice’s arm. </p><p>“I have…to see…if the…the bullet is still…there,” her words come out broken behind chattering teeth. Rio purses her lips, trying to will herself to stop shaking. “You cannot…scream. No matter how much it hurts.” </p><p>Rio takes her non-reply as understanding. She lifts Alice’s arm carefully to inspect the backside. </p><p>Alice breaks out into silent sobs, mouth opening in a scream, but she remains silent.</p><p>For the first time today, Rio feels relieved. “It’s…it’s ok. It’s through-and-through,” Rio explains. “But I have to move you. Get pressure on the wound. You’ve lost too much blood.”</p><p>Alice just groans in response. </p><p>Rio hooks her hands around Alice’s waist, heaving her over her shoulder. Where she would normally be steady, lifting with ease, her knees now feel weak, threatening to buckle below her. </p><p>Her hands yank at the third floor door. It slams behind her, the sound echoing through the once silent building. It makes her wince. </p><p>She finds an empty patient room, a bed neatly made before her. She deposits Alice onto it as carefully as she can in her weak state. Blood still seeps from the wound, not fast but steady enough to soak the sheets. </p><p>Rio rummages through the cabinets and drawers in the room to find them all empty. Fucking hospital regulations. </p><p>Alice needs a tourniquet. </p><p>Electric cords slip too much to form tight knots. An empty room means no readily available IV tubing. Rio attempts to rip a strip of fabric from the bedding below Alice. But re-enforced edges and her unsteady, shaking hands means she’s unsuccessful. </p><p>A shoelace would work perfectly. </p><p>And Rio’s shoes were sitting two floors above her, the laces untied.</p><p>She looks down at Alice’s shoes. Slip-ons.</p><p>“I’m going to find some supplies,” Rio says roughly. Her hands are still trembling. The rushes of adrenaline are starting to make her feel ill - a headache throbs in her temples and behind her eyes, dizziness threatening to overtake her. </p><p>She steps out of the room and once again presses herself flat into the wall. </p><p>A harsh crack splits through the air. The sound is piercing. It causes Rio to jump, fear like she’s never felt in her life surging through her. Ringing starts in Rio’s ears almost instantly. The smell of remnants of gunsmoke fill the hall. </p><p>It’s close. </p><p>So close.</p><p>Another surge of dread and adrenaline rockets through her at the possibility that it could have been aimed at Agatha. She feels like crumbling, right there in the hallway at the possibility that she could be somewhere on this floor - alone, injured and dying. </p><p>She rounds the corner and nearly collides with a nurse. They both gasp and recoil. The nurse pivots instantly to flee, but Rio snags the edge of her scrubs with her fingertips.</p><p>“Hey, hey it’s ok,” Rio pleads. “I need your help,” </p><p>The nurse nods wildly, her eyes wide with terror. </p><p>Rio points to Alice’s room. “A doctor has been hit. Tourniquet her left arm and start on IV in the right. Pump her full of fluids until someone can get to you.” </p><p>The nurse freezes, the words not registering. </p><p>“Go!” Rio whispers harshly. </p><p>The nurse bolts for a nearby supply cart, easing drawers open with shaking hands, moving as quietly as her fear will allow. </p><p>Rio turns away before she can second guess herself. She hopes Alice will forgive her for leaving. That they will both be alive to have that conversation. </p><p>For now, she has to find Agatha. </p><p>Rio continues down the hallway, her bloody socks leaving wet footprints in her wake. She peels them off mid-stride, shoving them into her pocket and continues in her bare feet.</p><p>There are at least 3 supply closets on each floor. And Agatha gave her no indication of which one she was in. Rio isn’t even sure Agatha knows. It’s a blind guess. </p><p>Would Agatha run into the first one she sees or go all the way to the end of the hall, away from people? She doesn’t have time to try to mentally untangle Agatha’s instinct. She reaches for the handle of the first door she comes to. </p><p>She imagines Agatha sitting in the back corner, legs drawn up, waiting for her. </p><p>They can huddle in there together, behind the shelves, out of sight and ride this thing out. </p><p>They will be so hidden, so hard to find. </p><p>She yanks open the door. </p><p>It’s not Agatha that greets her on the other side. </p><p>“Dr. Vidal,” a man’s voice snickers, lips curling cruelly over his teeth. “<em>Just</em> the person I was looking for.”</p><p>“Frank!” She squeaks louder than she intended, the name cracking in her throat. “I…”</p><p>Rio tumbles backward out the door, bare feet tangling as she falls onto the linoleum floor. Her ass hits hard enough to bruise her tailbone, but it’s of little concern now. </p><p>She doesn’t have time to stand because Frank starts stalking toward her. Even in the near darkness of the hallway, she can see the shiny metal in his right hand, fingers wrapped around the trigger. </p><p>She scrambles backward, flipping over to crawl on her hands and knees as fast as she can, but Frank is faster. She feels a hand on her ankle before she’s yanked across the cool floor toward him. </p><p>“YOU,” he roars. With one hand still on her ankle, he flips her over until she faces him. She lifts her back quickly off the floor, feet flat on the floor, knees bent. It’s too vulnerable.</p><p>His right hand lifts. </p><p>And suddenly, from her spot on the floor, Rio is staring down the barrel of his gun. </p><p>“You killed my wife.” </p><p>The cold steel presses between her eyes, biting into the skin of her forehead. </p><p>This is it. This is how it ends. </p><p>They say when Death is coming for you, you can feel it. There is no playback of happy moments, no reel flashing before your eyes. Time slows. A sixth sense that when the great beyond is headed for you, you know it. </p><p>That Death herself is waiting, watching from the corner of the room to usher you to the other side. </p><p>Rio feels it now. Like she’s standing on the edge of something, her toes leaning dangerously over the edge. The hallway around her dims, the edges of her vision blurring, tunneling inward until there’s nothing left but what’s directly in front of her. Frank. The gun. Like sinking into oblivion. Like being pulled underwater in the ocean, the deep dark closing in with no room to turn back or swim up. </p><p>There was a time when Rio believed in God. She sat on hard wooden pews every Sunday, velvet dresses sliding along the varnish. Her mother would be beside her, faithfully tracing the sign of the cross. Rio would press her knees into wooden kneelers until they ached, trying to atone for sins she didn’t know she committed. When she turned seven, she donned the frilly white dress, flowers in her hair while communion was placed on her tongue. </p><p>She no longer believes in God. </p><p>When the church told her she would go to hell simply for falling in love with the wrong gender, she couldn’t justify the devotion anymore. </p><p>Now on her knees, she whispers prayers anyway - not to God, not really. To anything. To everything. Something that might reach out and keep her alive. </p><p>Something wet slides down her cheeks. It takes her a second to realize she’s crying. </p><p>Frank is shouting now. Her name. His wife’s name. The words are swirling together, muffling as they reach her ears until she can’t make them out anymore. Grief, blame, heartache consuming him; rushing toward her. </p><p>It doesn’t matter what he says. Not really. Because the end is coming at her like a freight train and she’s helpless to stop it. </p><p>The sound of footsteps coming toward them startles them both. </p><p>Frank swings blindly toward the sound, firing twice. One round cracks into a wall. The other sparks off the floor. </p><p>Then a figure comes to stand in the hallway in the haze of the gunsmoke. Blue scrubs, unruly hair. </p><p>Even without a clear view of her face, Rio knows exactly who it is. </p><p>“No, no. Please Agatha!” Rio begs, panic tearing from her chest. She lifts a hand, frantic as if she could physically wave her away by magic. “Agatha, you have to go! You have to leave <em>right now.</em>” </p><p>“Shut up!” Frank shouts, whipping the gun back toward Rio. “Just shut up! I can’t think when you are hysterical like that.” </p><p>“I’m not leaving you,” Agatha says defiantly, ignoring Frank completely.</p><p>But even from this distance, Rio can see it - and it means Frank must too. There is a tremor in Agatha’s hands, her breathing shallow and stuttered. Tears are already streaking down her face, dark tracks down her cheeks from her mascara. </p><p>Agatha takes a step toward them.</p><p>“Stop!” Frank shouts, snapping the gun in her direction.</p><p>Agatha freezes. Slowly, she lifts her hands in surrender. But her eyes never leave his - she narrows her gaze at him with confidence she doesn’t actually have. </p><p>She’s baiting him. </p><p>Rio’s stomach tightens at the realization - Agatha isn’t trying to escape. </p><p>She is offering herself, walking into death on purpose. </p><p>Frank swipes a hand across his face, exhaling raggedly. His shoulders tense, the barrel wavering in his grip. He’s losing control - and that might be the worst case scenario. </p><p>The second he looks away, just a fraction of an inch, Agatha steps forward again. </p><p>“I said STOP!” he roars. </p><p>Her lips curve faintly, just enough to try to show defiance, not fear. Rio hates that she sees right through it. The way Agatha’s lip trembles, the way her hands shake slightly where they are raised, the red of her eyes - despite looking death in the face, Agatha is terrified. </p><p>“You are trying to distract me from her,” he snaps. His patience is fraying. The gun swings wildly now, back and forth between them.</p><p>“Frank, ignore her,” Rio starts, more steady than she feels. “I’m right here. It’s me you want.”</p><p>Frank lets out a humorless, cruel laugh. </p><p>Agatha doesn’t back down. “Please. Just put the gun down.” </p><p>“I said stop talking!” Frank’s anger boils over, red blotches covering his cheeks and chest now, beads of sweat form along his brow. “You don’t get to talk.” </p><p>He jabs the gun toward Rio. “You think this ends with her saving you?” </p><p>Rio shakes her head wildly. She focuses only on Frank. Avoiding eye contact with Agatha completely. “I didn’t ask her to. She’s nothing. Nobody. It’s just you and me, Frank. Focus on me.” She hopes Frank doesn’t see through the lie. She hopes Agatha does.  </p><p>“Oh but that’s where you are wrong. Because <em>you</em> are going to pay for her little mistake.”</p><p>“Wait…” Rio barely gets the word out before the butt of the gun collides with her temple. </p><p>White bursts behind her eyes as her head snaps back. Instantly, she tastes blood. The roaring in her ears is back, louder than before.</p><p>Through the haze, Agatha screams. She lunges forward two steps before she’s stopped again. </p><p>“Don’t move!” Frank screams, whipping the gun back up. “Don’t you dare move again.”</p><p>Rio tries to blink the hallway back into focus. Her head spins when she turns toward Frank. </p><p>He’s breathing too hard, too erratic as his chest heaves. He looks…almost scared. </p><p>“This isn’t about you,” he yells down the hall toward Agatha. She’s made it halfway to them already. Rio wants to yell for her to back up, but she can’t risk provoking Frank further. “This is between us.” </p><p>The barrel of the gun is back, aimed directly at her forehead. But this time, Rio looks past him. She shakes her head at Agatha, just barely. </p><p>Because Rio knows the truth - there is no plan, no leverage. There is no way out. </p><p>She sees Agatha’s face fall, the horror flickering across her features. Her eyes go glassy. She understands it too. This is the moment. They’ve run out of time. </p><p>“I love you,” Rio mouths. </p><p>Rio doesn’t close her eyes. She locks them against Agatha’s - her blue eyes swirling like a storm meet her deep brown. </p><p>She wants her last sight to be Agatha’s face. To make sure she knows. </p><p>“I love you too,” Agatha whispers. Then her hands twitch slightly, curling into fists where she drops them to her sides. She straightens her spine. </p><p>The gun clicks as it cocks. </p><p>And just before Rio closes her eyes, she sees Agatha move - breaking into a run, straight toward her.</p><p>Toward the gun.</p><p>And then…</p><p>A loud bang erupts, echoing in the confined space. </p>
