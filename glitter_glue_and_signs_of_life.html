<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Agatha couldn’t move. It was her, she was sure of it—the dancer from the club, on the night of the last day of school. A <em>stripper</em> was standing in her classroom, addressing her second-graders. A stripper who, until this very moment, had been filed neatly into the category of <em>things Agatha would never think about again.</em> (Except that one time, when she got too drunk on the Fourth of July. And that other time, when she got too drunk on the Seventh of July, which was just a normal Tuesday.) And yet here she was, in practical jeans and a black tee, looking every inch like a competent professional.</p><p>OR</p><p>First ten minutes of Afternoon Delight meets...the American public school system?

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Hi, lovelies. Heads up that I am carving out a long love affair with this piece of writing. I'm taking my sweet time and loving on every paragraph. Bookmark it and wait until I'm done to spend a night on it, or read along with me as it takes shape--whatever feels most like a little treat. I'm grateful to be slowly polishing off the rust from this writing thing after largely ignoring it for years, and especially grateful to be doing it in this space with our two favorite players of all time. Welcome in! Hope you enjoy it. 🖤</p></blockquote>

<br/>
</p><p>Being stuck in the parking lot on the last day of school was Agatha Harkness's personal nightmare. In fact, she'd literally had this nightmare before—a hoard of parents closing in on the car windows with lifeless eyes. She slumped her head against the window, and considered it might be time to stop watching<em> The Walking Dead</em> on school nights. A podcast played automatically through her speakers, and the re-telling of a woman's horrific murder faded to background noise. Surely human serial killers were more innocuous than zombies.</p><p>She scanned the playground automatically, and her eyes fell to the usual trouble spots: the slide, the corner by the lunch table, the section underneath the play structure. A fourth-grader threw her tiny arms around her best friend, their cheeks pressed together in earnest. Their mothers stood patiently nearby, watching the line of cars grow steadily longer.</p><p>Agatha remembered when she used to feel more like a fourth-grader than a mother on the last day of school. She remembered the final bell, and the smell of hot asphalt, the June sunshine peeling the weight off her shoulders. Now, the ache of the year dug deep into her back. Her contacts scratched at her eyes, and the furrow between her brows felt like it was settling deeper into her face with every passing glance in the rearview.</p><p>A honk startled her, and she gestured to the car in front of her, which had moved a total of four inches. The man behind her honked again, and Agatha locked eyes with him in the mirror.</p><p>“There’s no room, asshole!” she yelled, plastering a smile on her face.</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>She jumped. Her head hit the roof, and she winced, clutching at the sore spot. She twisted around to find Wanda peering through her very open back window.</p><p>“Fuck me,” Agatha muttered.</p><p>“You know your back windows are open?”</p><p>Agatha resisted the urge to point out that Wanda's head was still sticking through said window.</p><p>“Katie Buckers just came up to me and asked why Mrs. H. was yelling and listening to a, quote, ‘killing story?’” </p><p>She moved up to the front, and Agatha glanced at the man in the mirror again. He ceremoniously flipped her off.</p><p>“What can I do for you, Principal Maximoff?”</p><p>“Don't call me that. Where’s Nicky?”</p><p>“Sleepover.” </p><p>“With <em>who</em>?” </p><p>“Oh, don’t be jealous. Jacob, from his class.”</p><p>Wanda’s mouth fell open. “Jacob, as in, Jacob with the twin sister Ella? Nicky’s sleeping over at <em> another </em> house of twins?</p><p>“Aren’t the boys sleeping over at our place next week?”</p><p>Wanda ignored her and shot her a sympathetic look. “What did you have planned?”</p><p>“I thought we could get last-day-of-school ice cream," Agatha said, trying not to sound so pathetic. "But apparently, that's not as enticing as whatever new video game Jacob has, which I literally don’t understand how to pronounce.” </p><p>“Of course you can’t pronounce it. You still call them video games.”</p><p>“What the fuck else am I supposed to call them?”</p><p>“They’re just ‘games.' Everything is a video now; you don’t have to say it.” </p><p>“Great,” Agatha said. “Now I feel sad <em>and</em> geriatric around these twenty-seven year-old mothers with amazing tits. Thank you for that. I’m going to go home and not come back here for two months, if that’s okay with you, <em> Principal</em>.” </p><p>“Your tits look great and you know it.”</p><p>“I’m calling HR.”</p><p>Wanda laughed. “Do you want to grab a drink tonight? My treat, for my employee of the year.”</p><p>“You’re kidding.”</p><p>“About employee of the year, obviously. I know you're the one that enabled screen reader on Sharon's desktop, by the way."</p><p>Agatha stifled a laugh. "The woman sits at that computer all day; you can't say you weren't a little curious."</p><p>"I could hear extremely detailed romantasy reviews from inside my office, so thanks to you, I'll never be curious about anything ever again. And I'm not kidding about the drink. You need to loosen up a little; I’ve never seen you like this on the last day of school."</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath, leaning her head back against the seat. She placed both hands on the wheel, considering the proposition honestly. She hadn’t been able to really hang out with Wanda in months outside of school, and she did miss her friend. </p><p>“I can’t,” she said finally, eyes falling to the dashboard clock. “Nicky’s out, which means Josh and I have to do date night.”</p><p>“Ooh, ‘have to’? Really selling it.” </p><p>Maybe she should have felt offended on behalf of her husband, or herself, but she'd said it—it seemed pointless to backtrack. </p><p>Wanda patted Agatha’s arm as a parent beckoned her from the front steps. “Call me sometime. Let’s hang out, without our children, before it’s August all of a sudden.”</p><p>“Deal."</p><p>“Don’t have too much fun tonight,” Wanda called.</p><p>"I will hope and pray for boring," Agatha said, fingers crossed and arms over her chest.</p><p>The car in front of her moved, finally, and she glanced in the rearview again. “Honk at me one more time,” she muttered, but he didn’t catch her eye. He was leaning his head in his hand, talking to his kid. She recognized that same blank stare that meant one half of his mind was elsewhere, and the other was responding to whatever sweet, simple nonsense his kid was spouting at him. She ignored the tug in her chest and the emptiness of her own back seat, and pulled out of the lot, towards home.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Agatha deposited the laundry onto her bed, and deposited herself on top of the pile. She snuggled into the clothes and inhaled. It was a strange habit of hers, spooning the laundry fresh from the dryer. She felt she'd be content to die that way, buried alive under a warm embrace of shirt sleeves and pajama pants.</p><p>She closed her eyes, and tried not to think about the night ahead—the familiar stagnancy of conversation in a dimly lit restaurant, looking at the man she'd known so deeply for twenty years, and knowing even more deeply that she'd long run out of things to say. The clothes started to cool, and she hated them for it. She felt that if she really tried, she could cry about it. The clothes, not the husband. Never really the husband.</p><p>She sat up, forcing her hands to fold, and considered fast-forwarding her podcast to the grizzly details. Despite all the parenting books on the dangers of desensitization, she'd secretly always thought that unless someone was being chainsawed or stuffed into a freezer, <em>just-plain-murder</em> was a little mundane.</p><blockquote>
<p>“<em>Laughlin frequented the same strip club in Orange County, California, but he fell outside of the usual mold—Laughlin was married. His wife of nine years, Patricia, often visited the club with him. The club owner at the time described her as an independent, confident woman, often chatting with the dancers on her own, presumably building relationships on behalf of her husband, who would later reap the solemn reward.”</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Agatha winced at the over-the-top wording, then froze, wondering if she'd imagined the sound from her front door. She swore that her hearing had changed once she became a teacher, and then again once she became a mother—she had no clue when someone was yelling her name, but she could hear the doorknob turn in slow motion from across the house. She felt the sinking in her chest, directly followed by the guilt, and Josh came into the room. </p><p>“Hey.” His eyes were on his phone. He flopped onto the bed, toppling a pile of shirts.</p><p>“Hi.” She didn’t bother pausing the killing story. “How was work?”</p><p>“You know,” he mumbled. </p><p>Agatha traced the buttons on a purple blouse.</p><p>“Oh shit." He looked at her. “Last day of school!”</p><p>Agatha squinted a little. Did he think that was a <em> question</em>? </p><p>“Jacob’s mom got Nicky, and I’m picking him up at nine tomorrow.”</p><p>“Oh, that’s right. What do you want to do tonight?”</p><p>He was looking at his phone again, and the words caught in her throat. She wanted to lay in a warm pile of laundry and have it never cool off. She wanted to get ice cream with Nicky and hear him talk unintelligibly about his video game. She wanted to drink a margarita the size of her face with Wanda, and rank this year’s kids and parents by how likely she would be to leave them stranded in the case of a zombie apocalypse. Instead of answering, she turned her focus back to just-plain-murder.</p><blockquote>
<p>
<em> “Eric and Patricia Laughlin had a seemingly perfect marriage, always seen together at bars and strip clubs in the area. Until one day, when Patricia disappeared. She was never seen alive again. A week later, she was found dead in her home, along with Eric Laughlin, also deceased. Laughlin had turned on her, and the deaths were ruled a murder-suicide.” </em>
</p>
</blockquote><p>Agatha jabbed at the pause button, and placed the shirt on top of the fallen pile. <em> The perfect marriage</em>, turning poisonous. It sounded so different than crumbling into nothing. She looked at Josh, who hadn’t noticed her stillness, and wondered which was worse.</p><p>“We could go out? Try somewhere new?”</p><p>“Yeah, sure,” he said, distracted. “Oh, there was this place my buddies at work were talking about; it could be fun? It’s a club in the city.”</p><p>“Going into Boston on a Friday night? Josh, come on.”</p><p>“You come on, it’s the last day of school! Taxi is on me.” </p><p>“Wow, a gentleman.” Agatha tugged at a pair of Josh’s underwear that lay trapped under his back. “Sure, okay. What is this place? What’s the vibe?”</p><p>“Not sure. Can you actually look it up before we go?”</p><p>“Can I look it up? Me?” Agatha repeated, his briefs still clutched in her hand.</p><p>“Yeah,” Josh mumbled. “I want to know what to wear.”</p><p>Agatha held his underwear up to the light, her eyes fixing on a large hole in the side. “God, how long have these been like this?”</p><p>“I don't know, I’ve had those since college.”</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath, and dropped them on the bed, unfolded. She turned to the bathroom, suddenly needing scalding water on her back.</p><p>“Leave the door open,” Josh called. “I have to pee.”</p><p>Agatha jabbed her thumb in the air without turning around, and leaned her forehead against the cool glass of the shower wall. For the second time that day, she uttered the agitated, long-suffering two words: “Fuck me.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The club, of course, was a strip club.</p><p>Josh had asked her again in the taxi if she'd looked it up, and of course, <em> of-fucking-course</em>, she had said yes, and of course, she hadn’t looked it up, because she really didn’t care where they were going. So they'd stepped out of the taxi onto the sidewalk in the warm night air, and stood staring at the giant, neon pink silhouette of a naked woman above their heads.</p><p>Josh looked at it, the light flickering, his mouth open. “I thought you said you–”</p><p>“I lied.” She cut him off, gathering her purse more firmly over her shoulder. Irritation flared in her chest, the self-loathing kind, the everyone-and-everything-loathing kind. She stared at the pink woman in spite. “What now? Do we just go home?”</p><p>“I mean...” Josh shrugged. “It’s up to you. They did say it was fun, and their wives were there too, so maybe…”</p><p>“Maybe <em>what</em>?” </p><p>“I don’t know.” He held up his hands. "It’s a little more interesting than a restaurant, right? And maybe it could, like, get us in the <em> mood,</em> or something.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. She thought about the podcast, and wondered whether they would stumble upon a serial killer or his wife, chatting with dancers in a booth. But then again, no. That was Orange County, California, not Boston. Boston was the mundane. </p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>The bass vibrated in her teeth, and a thick haze of smoke filled the space. Agatha suppressed the urge to cough, and hoped no one had seen. Surely she couldn’t be <em> that </em> old. She downed whatever shot Josh handed her. It might have been tequila, but it went down too smooth, so she flagged the bartender for another. The second one hit her chest the way she remembered.</p><p>She turned back to the room, her gaze settling on the dancers and the glitter dusting their skin. Their long legs sparkled and flashed under the hot stage lights, ending in colorful stilettos. The effect was dazzling. She clocked the overuse but undeniable effectiveness of the smokey eye, bodies curling and spinning easily around the poles.</p><p>They looked like the Barbies her students used to bring into her classroom fifteen years ago—smooth, slender bodies, cartoonishly voluptuous. Their legs were perpetually split wide, hanging upside down from desks or flying through the air, until they were forcibly put away. She laughed aloud at the absurdity of the comparison, and her eyes followed a dancer in yellow spandex as she swung her legs around a pole. With a practiced flourish, the dancer pulled her leg into a vertical split, and Agatha realized that it was, in fact, yellow, <em> crotchless </em> spandex. One moment, she was mid-laugh, and the next, she was making direct eye contact with the woman's entire vulva. Agatha turned quickly back to the bar, and ordered a third shot.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>They struck up a first-awkward then easy conversation with the couple sitting next to them at the bar.</p><p>“So, how long have you been together?” Agatha said, unsure what she was supposed to ask a couple who frequented a strip club.</p><p>“Nine years!” Carl said. He put an arm around Mindy's shoulder.</p><p>Agatha wanted to ask, <em> Are you a serial killer? </em> but thought better of it, because she wasn’t <em> that </em> drunk. She wasn’t sure how long it took to get <em> that </em> drunk, but at some point, she stopped checking the time. She was laughing, and it was the last day of school. The obnoxiously tall strippers glittered under the lights like giant goddesses, or constellations come to life, and Carl and Mindy tucked hundred-dollar bills into their bras. Agatha found it all surreal and hilarious.</p><p>“I’m glad we came,” Agatha slurred in Josh’s general direction. </p><p>“Ha, I told you!” His voice wavered.</p><p>She turned just in time to see Mindy with a dancer at the back of the club. </p><p>“Where’s she going?” she asked Carl, watching them vanish through a curtain of gold fringe.</p><p>“Private room.” Carl swirled the ice in his glass and leaned closer. “Fifty bucks for twenty minutes. You can pick whoever you like.”</p><p>Agatha snorted, choking on her drink, and Josh laughed so hard he almost fell sideways into the booth.</p><p>“What about her?” Josh pointed at a statuesque blonde in pink stilettos. He waggled his eyebrows, and Agatha  watched the dancer was adjust her bra straps. She let out another laugh, but this one came too fast to feel real. The idea of vanishing behind a curtain with that woman felt strange. Absurd, even. And besides, who even knew what was really back there? <em> This is how women get murdered, </em> she reminded herself. <em> Or wait… was it just the dancers that got murdered? </em></p><p>“Or her?” Josh was saying, pointing across the room. </p><p>Agatha followed his finger, her gaze settling on the back of a woman by the bar, talking to a waiter. Her hair, dark and sleek, fell just above the middle of her back, catching the light as she shifted her weight. An intricate tattoo curved around her ribcage, and Agatha found herself leaning forward, her eyes straining to decipher the shape. Then the woman turned. She locked eyes with Agatha.</p><p>The club around her blurred at the edges, the music fading to a vibration against the vinyl under her thighs. Agatha froze, unable to look away. The woman was dressed in black lace that framed the toned lines of her stomach, and Agatha took in the straight line of her shoulders. There was no exaggerated curve of the spine, no push of her chest or pop of a hip. She wasn’t mimicking sexy, or wasn’t trying too hard. She wasn’t trying at all. She was just standing there, her weight distributed dead-even over her green stilettos<em>. </em> </p><p>Agatha tried to rationalize this new understanding of what a stripper looked like, but her head felt foggy, and all she could think was that she didn’t know a woman could look like this in real life. Then the woman smiled, slow and deliberate, the corners of her mouth curving into something playful. She lifted her hand and waved. Agatha blinked, unsure if the gesture was meant for her, and then glanced quickly away.</p><p>She let out a nervous laugh, sucking down the last of her drink, but her gaze flicked back instinctively. The woman was still looking at her. Surely this had to be the longest anyone had ever looked at her. Agatha swallowed hard around her straw, the room spinning. Then, this woman she couldn’t stop looking at, was talking to someone—<em>Josh</em>. She watched as he handed her a fifty dollar bill and pointed in Agatha's direction.</p><p>Her stomach flipped. The woman smiled again, wider this time, and walked toward her, hips swaying in a way Agatha tried hard not to stare at. She didn’t stop until she was directly in front of Agatha, crouching slowly to her level.</p><p>“Hey,” the woman said, her tongue sticking in the side of her cheek. </p><p>“Uh, hi,” Agatha said, her laugh bubbling out as she glanced at Josh and Carl.</p><p>“Come with me,” the woman said simply, and took Agatha’s hand.</p><p>The room melted into a haze of color and sound, leaving only the weight of the woman’s palm in hers. Her legs moved of their own accord, and before she could process what was happening, they were alone.</p><p>“So, what’s your name?" Agatha said, sitting on a hard bench. "Like, what do I call you?”</p><p>The woman closed the curtains behind her, and Agatha felt her eyes flitting back to the lace. It wasn’t anything over-the-top, and Agatha was momentarily at a loss—she had never before understood the meaning of “understated elegance,” but now here it was, staring her quite literally in the face.</p><p>“I go by a lot of names,” the woman said, her hips swaying to the music. She tossed her hair back, and Agatha watched, mesmerized.</p><p>“Like what?” she managed, clearing her throat. The words came out before she could think. She thought maybe the worst thing that could happen right now was being alone with this woman in silence.</p><p>“Reaper, Lady Death, River of Life.”</p><p>The woman put her hands on either side of Agatha’s lap. Her face was so close, Agatha could see each of her individual lashes.</p><p>“It’s not really important,” the woman added, turning around.</p><p>The sudden absence of her face gave Agatha’s gaze permission to wander, and she let it trail down the curve of her spine to the tattoo that wrapped around her ribcage. Now, she could make out branches, intertwined and painstakingly detailed. It looked a little like the Tree of Life, but strange and asymmetrical. She felt the absurd urge to reach out and trace the lines with her fingertips.</p><p>The woman turned back around, hips rolling in perfect time, and the small, curtained room felt suddenly too warm. Agatha felt the dregs of her lucidity slipping from her grasp, the alcohol making everything loud and fuzzy and <em>hot</em>. Agatha breathed in again, and the woman brushed her hands up her side, dipping lightly under her shirt. Agatha pushed the shirt down, self-conscious.</p><p>“I… had a baby,” she muttered, by way of explanation, and then wondered why she'd said it. The woman let go without pause, standing up straight. She reached for Agatha’s face, and tilted her head up.</p><p>“That’s okay,” she said simply, her hand holding tight to Agatha’s chin. Agatha swallowed.</p><p>Then, Lady Death knelt slowly in front of her. She moved with such precision and control that Agatha didn't even blink. Then she felt lips brush against her knee, and her breath left on an exhale, her head falling back against the wall with a soft thud. The woman's hands trailed down Agatha’s thighs, thumbs brushing the insides, and it hit Agatha all at once. She felt everything—how drunk she was, how fast she was breathing, how turned on she was. Getting a lap dance from a woman.</p><p>Just as her brain screamed at her to get up, to leave, to <em> do </em> something, the woman planted her knees on either side of Agatha’s hips and climbed into her lap. She hovered just above Agatha, dancing slowly, lightly against her. Even through her own shirt and her jacket—why, <em> why </em> was she still wearing her fucking jacket—Agatha could feel the lace scratching against her. She couldn’t tell if she was trying <em> not </em> to think about what was underneath all that black lace, or if she was thinking about it too hard. Her hands balled into fists against the bench.</p><p>“You can touch me, you know,” the woman said. She smiled, glancing at Agatha’s fists.</p><p>Agatha let out a breathless laugh. “I thought that, like, wasn’t allowed. Like in the movies.”</p><p>The woman tilted her head. “Depends on the dancer. And the client. I don’t let men touch.”</p><p>Something hot and feverish twisted in Agatha’s stomach. The thought of moving her hands from the bench made her feel dizzy, so she kept them firmly in place, her nails pressing into her palms.</p><p>“I dance differently with women, too,” Lady Death murmured, leaning in close.</p><p>“Why?” Agatha rasped. Her eyes couldn’t pick one thing to focus on, flitting between the hollow of her neck, and the arching of her back, and the twisting of her hips.</p><p>“Most men want me to face away,” she said. “They want my ass in their face, usually.”</p><p>“Women don’t…” Agatha faltered. “Women don’t want that?”</p><p>“Well, some do,” the woman replied, her grin positively filthy. “But most want me up close. They want to feel me pressed against them. They want to be <em> held</em>.”</p><p>She moved a hand to the back of Agatha’s neck, planting a stiletto loudly against the bench, a centimeter away from Agatha’s clenched fist. The woman leaned down. “They want to see my face.”</p><p>"You have a nice face," Agatha mumbled, and then realized with horror what she'd said. Lady Death paused, her lips twitching.</p><p>"Thanks." </p><p>She started to move again, and Agatha wanted to cover her face with her hands, and also put those hands on the various layering and cuts of black lace in front of her. She wanted to see if it was tight, or breathable, if it dug into the skin of her stomach, and if Agatha's fingers under the waistband might feel a little like relief.</p><p>“How old are you?” Agatha blurted, ashamed that the thought had just occurred to her.</p><p>“Thirty.”</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>The woman arched her brow.</p><p>“You know,” she purred in Agatha’s ear. “The average age of a dancer is forty-four. Age comes with confidence, and confidence is sexy.” She tugged hard on Agatha’s lapels, and Agatha felt the brush of her lips against the shell of her ear. “But you can tell that some women, like you, were already very fucking sexy to begin with. So, you should really be asking yourself: why aren’t you more confident?”</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, and for a second she just blinked. The words caught up to her in slow motion, and she took too long to realize that the woman had already dismounted. When she came to, her gaze landed on Lady Death leaning casually against the wall by the curtain, examining her nails.</p><p>Agatha stood, stumbling, and pushed past the curtain. She blinked hard, her throat tight and her heart pounding. She found Josh and pulled his arm, but all she could feel was the slow press of the woman’s hips against hers, the low voice in her ear, the heat of lips on her knee. She didn’t register walking out of the club, or the door closing behind her, or the slap of wind against her flushed face as she stood in the middle of the sidewalk.</p><p>Inexplicably, <em>murder</em> jumped into her addled mind. Agatha suddenly knew, with the kind of truth that only revealed itself when she was wasted, that the homicide detectives in question had missed the point. Patricia Laughlin—wife of a serial killer, footnote of horror—must have met a woman like Lady Death. She would have spent days watching her dance, feeling her body move against hers, looking into her dark eyes. And then she would have woken up one day and realized how ridiculous it all was—captivating the attention of a creature like that, only to hand her over to her ordinary husband.</p><p>Agatha realized she was outside now, sympathy for serial killers' wives swirling in her brain, tequila doing the same in her gut. She vaguely recognized Josh standing nearby. He was looking at her, slurring, “Oh shit, are you good?”</p><p>Agatha looked into his face, his heavy-lidded eyes, and for a long, terrifying moment, she felt nothing. And then she threw up on the sidewalk. </p><p>Wiping her mouth with her sleeve, she braced a hand against the brick wall to steady herself, and closed her eyes. </p><p>“Oh fuck, dude,” Josh said. “So…I guess you’re not, like, in the mood to…”</p><p>He trailed off, and she looked at him, her eyes unfocused. She let out a quiet, defeated sound. He was still staring at her, pupils blown, on the sidewalk outside of a strip club in Boston. And that was it—that was the moment, under the pink neon sign of a naked woman, her mouth tasting sour, that she finally knew she had nothing left to give.</p><p>“You need new fucking underwear,” she said. And then she called them a taxi.</p>

<b> <em>TWO AND A HALF MONTHS LATER</em> </b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Agatha let herself be dragged out of bed by a very excited, very awake Nicky at six in the morning. He was practically vibrating, a reminder that the slow, forgiving mornings of summer were behind them. She startled like she did every morning, and smacked the top of her alarm clock before remembering that the off button was on the side. She hadn’t owned a top-snooze alarm since the nineties, but her brain refused the simple adjustment. The satisfying slap, paired with that distinct mix of thrill and dread, still lived in her muscle memory—the reflexive first motion of a School Day, lodged deep in the bend of her elbow. </p><p>She had bought the alarm clock in a bout of nostalgia last fall in an attempt to wean herself off late-night scrolling, like all the articles said she should. And now, one year later, she started her mornings with a violent assault of a plastic box, and she still took her phone to bed.</p><p>She didn’t think about it every morning anymore, or every night—the fact that her bed was empty. It had been almost two months since Josh had moved out, since their last knock-down, drag-out fight about something so impossibly stupid, they could no longer pretend. They were in the middle of screaming about the correct way to load new batteries into the TV remote (“You have to face them different ways, Agatha; that’s how fucking electricity works!” “Batteries aren’t fucking <em> electric</em>, Josh; that’s how fucking science works!”) when Josh had grabbed for the remote. It flew to the hardwood floor, the batteries skittering across the room. </p><p>He gripped his hair, and said: “Why are we doing this? We don’t even fucking love each other anymore.” </p><p>She stood there, her socks slipping on the hardwood, and felt something terribly akin to relief. She watched one of the batteries roll slowly under the couch.</p><p>“No,” she said. “I don’t even really like you.”</p><p>And then a week later he moved out, and a week after that she cleaned under the couch, and her fingers brushed against something smooth. She pulled out the stray battery, its edges covered in a crust of dust and acid. She sat on her heels in the living room, staring at the corroded metal, and laughed, the sound strange and unrestrained. It was an old, used battery that had been mixed in with the new. Her fingers closed around it, and she laughed and laughed on the floor of her empty house until her stomach started to ache, because of course, it wouldn't have mattered which way she’d been putting them into the remote.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Agatha curled her toes against the cool tile and took in her reflection. Her hair was its usual unsalvageable mess, but the dark circles under her eyes added a nice, unhinged touch—just the thing parents were hoping to see when they looked at their kid's new teacher. She reached for her glasses, not even considering the idea of rubbing contacts into her red-rimmed eyes.</p><p>Through the end of her marriage, through the separating itself, she hadn’t cried. Not when Josh assembled the moving boxes, not when he bubble-wrapped his bedside lamp and broke up the antique set (even though she was the one that had searched for them, and found them in Connecticut, and haggled for a good price with the hunched old man at the store, and <em> since fucking when </em>had Josh cared about that lamp?) </p><p>She didn’t cry until they told Nicky. That night, she'd wracked herself to sleep with sobs, the words snagging and rolling under her ribs. She was selfish. A bad mother. A cold wife. And the most damning of all: <em> responsible. </em></p><p>Since that night, the tears came too easily. Not just when she thought about Josh, or Nicky, or what could’ve been, but when she wasn’t thinking at all. When she folded socks, or put her car in park, or stood at her kitchen sink, scraping hardened spaghetti sauce off a plate. </p><p>Last night had been one of those nights. She’d never been able to sleep before the first day of school—not at five years old, not at forty-two. She was accustomed to the rhythm of it, the tossing and turning until the sun came in to relieve her. But this was the first time she'd cried instead.</p><p>She yawned, raking a brush through her hair with one hand and brushing her teeth with the other. She nudged the bathroom door open with her hip, sunlight turning the blue tiles green, and as expected, Nicky was standing there. His grin split into a delighted giggle, and Agatha felt the sharp, specific pride that came from making him laugh. Like most parents, she was an above-average multitasker, so it was hardly a special skill. But Nicky didn’t know that yet. For now, when she brushed her hair and teeth at once, she was special. She made a show of switching hands as he clung to her pant leg, his laughter bubbling louder with every exaggerated motion. </p><p>“Your turn,” she said, spitting into the sink and moving him into position.</p><p>“I want to do both, too!”</p><p>“Not today,” she said quickly, sidestepping the version of this morning where Nicky showed up to the first day of second grade with toothpaste in his hair.</p><p>She pulled a brush through his shoulder-length hair while he talked around the toothbrush in a garbled mess of syllables she pretended to understand. She hummed at the right moments, untangling a particularly stubborn knot near the nape of his neck.</p><p>“Still no haircut?” she asked lightly.</p><p>Nicky shook his head with the conviction of someone who didn’t have to detangle clumps of grass and dirt daily.</p><p>“All right, then,” she said. “Spit, rinse, and meet me in the kitchen, sailor.”</p><p>“Aye aye, Captain!” he said, toothpaste dribbling down his chin.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Agatha was halfway through packing their lunches when her phone rang. She put it on speaker, loading a sandwich into Nicky’s lunchbox.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” </p><p>“Why do you assume something’s wrong?” Wanda's voice crackled with the telltale bad service that meant she was already at school.</p><p>“Why are you calling me when I’m going to see you in forty minutes?” Agatha countered, shoving celery sticks on top of the sandwich. She closed the lid, knowing full well Nicky was going to pretend the celery wasn't there. </p><p>“I just wanted to check in on you. Big day, rough summer, to say the least.”</p><p>“I'll be <em>fine</em>." </p><p>“You know I’ve got your back, right? Nobody blames you for what you said.”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “That is a <em> bold-faced </em> lie.”</p><p>“Okay, people definitely blame you. But <em>I</em> don’t," Wanda added. "You’re a great teacher, you were going through a hard time, and you have nothing to worry about.”</p><p>“I really don’t want to talk about this right now, okay?” Agatha glanced at her watch. “I have to make breakfast. Is there anything else?”</p><p>“Yes,” Wanda said. “Stop by my office before class. I need to run something by you.”</p><p>Agatha froze, her arm elbow-deep in Nicky’s purple backpack. “You <em> just </em> said I have nothing to worry about.”</p><p>“You don’t. I just need a favor.”</p><p>Agatha zipped up the bag and paused. “Look, I know you pulled some strings for me. With the whole…summer thing. And to get Nicky in my class. It’ll help to have him close by this year, you know? This is a lot of change for him. And I know it probably wasn’t easy. Thank you, Wanda."</p><p>“Damn straight it wasn’t easy,” Wanda said, and Agatha laughed. “But you’re worth it, and so is that kid.”</p><p>“He is pretty fucking great,” Agatha said, and added: “See you soon, <em> Boss</em>.” She hung up on Wanda’s groan.</p><p>Nicky wandered into the kitchen, fully dressed in neon orange sweatpants and a <em>Lilo and Stitch</em> pajama shirt. Agatha stared at him, eyebrows raised.</p><p>“Did you get dressed all by yourself?”</p><p>“Yeah,” he said proudly. “I’m in second grade. I can do it myself.”</p><p>“You’re not going to get too hot in those pants?”</p><p>“Nope.”</p><p>“Well, okay, then,” Agatha said. “What do you want for breakfast, baby?”</p><p>She looked at him, seated across the kitchen island, his body slouching and and wiggling in that seven-year-old inchworm way. She felt her chest warm at the sight, followed by the recently renewed wave of guilt and fear that she was ripping apart his home over his very head. Yet another familiar piece of their morning routine.</p><p>“Pancakes!”</p><p>“Ooh, pancakes.” She glanced in the fridge. “Nope, no eggs. Try again.”</p><p>“Ummmm… Mac n’ cheese!”</p><p>“You want mac ‘n’ cheese for breakfast? How about cereal ‘n’ cheese?”</p><p>“What!” he squealed, and Agatha laughed. </p><p>“How about just cereal?” he said, eyes wide, and Agatha nodded seriously. </p><p>“Cereal it is.”</p><p>“Wait,” he said. “With milk, too.”</p><p>“Wild man,” Agatha muttered, and poured a bowl for each of them.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Agatha's hand drifted automatically to the lid of her coffee mug before they hit the first speed bump, and she glanced at newly painted mural on the front of the school. <em> Oyster Bend Elementary. </em> The letters, bright and cheerful, floated above a vibrant sea of river otters clutching oysters to their chests. </p><p>“Fucking idiots,” Agatha muttered.</p><p>“Mama,” Nicky said from the backseat. “That’s a bad word.”</p><p>“And what do we say about bad words?”</p><p>“I can say them when I’m old enough to drive a car,” he recited, resigned.</p><p>“That’s right. Look at the mural."</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, she caught two mothers standing side by side, glancing furtively at her car. One of them pointed surreptitiously, and the other shifted her PTA tote bag over her shoulder. Once, she would have thrived on this kind of attention, their eyes darting after her glossy heels clicking on the pavement.</p><p>In her twenties, when Agatha still subscribed to the allure of new beginnings, she used to primp for the first day of school. She would curl her hair or wear something that had to be ironed first—shirts that brought out the blue in her eyes and pressed blazers, and pencil skirts that showed off her calves. Her body had been toned and tight in all the right places, the way bodies were before they made room for another. When beginnings were still beginnings, she'd worn her heart and her confidence on her sleeve, and now it sat behind her in a booster seat, kicking its orange-clad legs.</p><p>Agatha tightened her grip on the steering wheel, looking pointedly away from the whispering women. She ignored the angry heat of embarrassment rising up her neck, and focused on the mural. </p><p>“I like it,” Nicky replied decisively. “The pink one is my favorite.”</p><p>“River otters don’t even eat oysters. <em>Sea </em> otters eat oysters, and our mascot is a river otter, because sea otters don’t live in Massachusetts.”</p><p>“But they’re not eating them,” Nicky said. “They’re holding them. Maybe they’re just friends.”</p><p>Agatha smiled despite herself. She leaned back against the headrest, her eyes catching his in the mirror. His ponytail bobbed as he swung his feet, his sweatpants obnoxiously neon in the morning sun.</p><p>“You know where you’re going when the bell rings, right?” she asked.</p><p>“Mama’s classroom,” Nicky said, raising his hands like he’d just won a prize. “Because you’re my teacher!”</p><p>“Right again, sailor.” </p><p>Agatha watched him jump from the car and join a group of kids who were climbing up the slide and falling like dominoes. Then, reluctantly, her eyes fell on the green double doors at the top of the steps, and she followed.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Wanda was waiting for her in the classroom when Agatha walked in, straightening a pile of papers on her desk.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha said, hanging Nicky’s backpack on a hook near the door. “What—oh, shit. You told me to meet you in your office.”</p><p>“I knew you’d forget,” Wanda said, beckoning her into a hug. She squeezed harder than necessary.</p><p>“So,” she said. “How are—”</p><p>“Don’t ask how I’m holding up." Agatha stopped her, hand in the air. “Not you.”</p><p>“Okay,” Wanda said, stepping back. “Fair enough. I have something I need to talk to you about. Sit.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes at Wanda’s tone and slid into one of the student desks, folding her arms across the too-small surface. They were silent for a moment, faint squeals of laughter drifting from the open window. </p><p>“Like I said on the phone,” Wanda started. “I don’t blame you for what happened this summer.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth, but Wanda cut her off with a look.</p><p>“I don’t blame you,” she repeated firmly. “But there are extra eyes on you now. I’m getting pressure from certain parents who aren’t thrilled about what you said. Or about the fact that Nicky’s in your class, even though it's against our policy.”</p><p>“<em>You</em> said it was fine."</p><p>“It is, because we all agree these are extenuating circumstances. But I need you to do something for me in return. To ease the pressure from the PTA, the school board, and the parents.”</p><p>“The <em>PTA</em>?” Agatha scoffed. “Since when are you in the pocket of those blonde hell-demons?”</p><p>“That's not fair,” Wanda said, and her expression softened. For the first time, Agatha noticed the slight shadows under her friend’s eyes. </p><p>“It’ll help if they have something else to focus on,” she continued lightly. “Or some<em>one</em>. I have a student teacher for you.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha shook her head. “Absolutely not. I have enough on my plate with my usual routine without babysitting some sweaty grad student who’s afraid of seven-year-olds.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Wanda said, sharper now. “I know this isn’t what you want, but here’s the deal: if you don’t take her, and you don’t play nice this semester, the board will vote to revoke your tenure. And then it’s out of my hands.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth dropped open, her ears ringing. “<em>Revoke </em> my—are you serious?”</p><p>“I tried to fight them on it, but they don't love it when people humiliate them and get away with it. This is damage control. Show them you’re a team player. Let the student teacher do her thing, you do yours, and by the end of the semester, this whole mess will blow over.”</p><p>Agatha stared, open-mouthed. “This is not the definition of <em> nothing to worry about.</em>”</p><p>Wanda gave her an apologetic smile, placing a thin file on the desk. “I’ll send her in after recess. Her name is Rio Vidal.”</p><p>“Great,” Agatha muttered, and Wanda opened the door.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Wanda added sincerely. “Happy Doomsday.”</p><p>The door shut behind her, their affectionate nickname for the first day of school feeling too apt all of a sudden. Agatha let out a low, exasperated groan, and tossed the file on her desk. She busied herself with her real concern of restoring the sanctity of her classroom. The supplies she’d hastily dumped last week were still piled in a crooked tower of cardboard and plastic, appropriately underneath the clock.</p><p>She stewed as she worked, stringing up twinkling lights and rehanging the paper leaves that had already fallen from the ceiling since last week. So what if some wet-behind-the-ears twenty-something was about to scrutinize her every move? So what if the PTA thought she was a loose cannon, if the school board thought she was unfit to teach? She paused with her stapler poised above the bulletin board, a paper squirrel caught under her impending strike. The squirrel stared back at her, the paper grin stretching smugly across its face, and she punched the stapler through its eye.</p><p>She stepped back to survey the scene. Kids whispered about her classroom in the hallways, their wide eyes peeking through the door whenever they thought she wasn’t looking. Even her old students found flimsy excuses to come back. Some claimed they were saying hi to a sibling or that they’d wandered in by mistake, but a few didn’t bother pretending. They just walked up to her and wrapped their arms around her waist. She liked that the best—when they remembered the world they’d been part of, and wanted to slip back inside for a little while.</p><p>The ceiling was a canopy of green, thick with paper leaves that glowed under the string lights. Against the back wall stood her pièce de résistance: a giant paper mache tree, its wide trunk rising from the floor, weighted by sandbags painted to look like mossy rocks. The branches stretched to the ceiling, where felt animals peeked from the leaves—an owl in glasses, a fox curled up with a book, a squirrel carrying a tiny red backpack. Beneath the tree, the rug was a vivid, grassy green, and the mismatched carpet squares were dotted with mushrooms and wildflowers. At the center sat her old armchair, worn and blue.</p><p>Every year, on the first day of school, students stepped into her room and froze. Their jaws dropped as they tilted their heads back to take it all in, wide eyes darting from the paper tree to the glowing canopy. Every year, Agatha watched them with a quiet thrill. It was, by far, her favorite part.</p><p>For a few hours a day, her students could forget the outside world entirely. In here, they could expand until they were bigger than they thought possible<em>. </em> The classroom was their very own planet, solid under their feet.</p><p>Agatha jabbed the stapler at a vine dangling over the edge of the bookshelf. Let the PTA gossip, and the school board hover. Let some overenthusiastic student teacher stare at her with moony eyes. They could serve whatever reprimands paired best with the sticks up their asses, but if they wanted to take her classroom, they'd have to drag her out by the feet first.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Three hours into the day, Agatha felt her sense of stability returning. She'd spent recess sipping her lukewarm coffee from her travel mug, her lungs expanding steadily, and selectively ignoring some of the more playful roughhousing. She was miserable at meditation, but recess worked. Now, the lights in her classroom dimmed, she felt herself settle, her inner critic closing its eyes and curling up by the light of the projector.</p><p>“Does anyone know the name of the town that we live in?”</p><p>Various children shouted answers at her. She called on June, quietly raising her hand, her bangs falling into her eyes.</p><p>“Massachusetts,” she said with a confidence that made Agatha smile.</p><p>“Hmm, good guess. That’s the <em> state</em>. I’ll give you a hint…it’s in the name of our school.”</p><p>“Oyster Bend!” June said, her face lighting up. Agatha let herself enjoy the comfortable rhythm in the clean back-and-forth of a lesson.</p><p>“Exactly. And who knows what a <em> mascot </em> is?” </p><p>Nicky raised his hand. “It’s an animal.”</p><p>Agatha nodded absently, distracted by the sight of him fidgeting in his seat. He tugged at the waistband of his sweatpants, his face flushed. She <em> knew </em> she should have made him change.</p><p>“Ms. Harkness?” A boy with messy brown hair was suddenly at her side—<em>Lonzo? No, Oliver</em>. “My brother’s in high school, and his mascot is a Pilgrim. That’s not an animal.”</p><p>“That is a great point, Oliver,” Agatha said, eyeing him. “Why are you—Did you need something up here?” </p><p>He ignored her question, taking a piece of tape from her dispenser, and then another, wrapping them around his index finger.</p><p>“A mascot can really be anything,” she said to the class, moving the tape out of Oliver’s reach and pointing him towards his desk, “that represents the students at a school.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes landed on two girls behind Oliver. Ellie was braiding Kara’s orange, frizzy hair, Kara completely unaware.</p><p>“Hands to ourselves,” Agatha reminded softly, and Ellie dropped her hands, her face pink.</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath. It was the faintest start to an unraveling that meant she was losing them. She skipped ahead a couple slides. “Does anyone know what <em> our </em> mascot is?” Agatha asked. “Maybe you saw it on the new mural when you came in this morning?”</p><p>“A dragon!”</p><p>“Unicorns!”</p><p>“Oyster!”</p><p>Second-graders weren’t known for their self-restraint, especially when guessing animals, but she could already feel the effect of this summer. She knew the signs: the attention slipping from her grasp one pair of eyes at a time, the too-quick fraying of her patience. It was far, far too early to be losing her patience.</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, Agatha caught Oliver, still playing with the tape. Somehow, he'd managed to pry the entire roll out of the dispenser before she’d thought to push it away. A disastrous oversight, she knew instantly. </p><p>He unraveled a foot-long piece, and pulled too hard. The tape snapped off the roll, his arm flung backward, and the tape jackknifed straight into Kara’s hair. Kara and Ellie screamed. Kara’s hand flew to her head in horror, feeling for the tape and finding it tangled in the amateur braid she hadn’t even realized was there.</p><p>“I can help,” Ellie said, her small, clumsy fingers making it undoubtedly worse. Oliver stared at his own hand, bewildered. Agatha was at their desks in seconds, crouching over Kara, her fingers working quickly to pry the tape loose.</p><p>“It’s okay, love. I’ve got it. Let me see,” she murmured, her voice calm. “Oliver. Tape on my desk, now.” </p><p>It wasn’t the first time she had pulled something out of a kid’s hair, but Kara’s hair was too frizzy, and clung stubbornly to the now-twisted piece of tape. </p><p>“So,” she continued valiantly. “Who else has a guess for what our mascot is?”</p><p>Kara started to cry, her sobs growing louder by the second, and Agatha shushed her soothingly. </p><p>“Mama, I’m HOT!” Nicky said suddenly, and an alarm sounded in Agatha’s head. </p><p>She recognized that voice—the one that meant he was seconds away from taking matters into his own hands. Embarrassingly, a thought struck her for the first time. She had talked to Nicky about what it would mean to have his mother as his teacher, but she had forgotten about the room. Nicky had grown up in this classroom, long before he was a student in it. His stroller had rested beside the desk, the smell of dry-erase settling into his newborn skin. The first things he'd seen, patterned on his brown eyes like rings on a tree trunk, were his parents’ anxious faces and a canopy of paper leaves. This had been <em> his </em> room since the day he was born, as much as it was Agatha’s, and he didn’t know any better than to act like it.</p><p>She turned just in time to see him walk himself confidently to the hooks by the door, and reach into his backpack. He pulled out his pair of shorts. </p><p>“Nicky,” she said, her hands still tangled in Kara’s hair. “Not now.”</p><p>“<em>Yes </em> now,” he yelled, and decisively, he pulled down his orange sweatpants. </p><p>The room erupted into laughter. Nicky froze, blinking like he’d miscalculated something fundamental. Kara wailed louder. Agatha felt her sanity begin to slip. And then, of course, the door opened. Wanda stood there, taking in the scene before her, her mouth hanging slightly open. </p><p>“Principal Max,” a few students shouted, waving excitedly. They always treated Wanda like some kind of celebrity, and usually, Agatha found it hilarious, but right now, she wanted to throw a stapler at her head for choosing this exact moment to enter.</p><p>“Hey, everyone! Hi Nicky,” Wanda said, glancing down at him with an amused smile. </p><p>“I’m hot, Aunt Wanda,” he announced, holding up his shorts.</p><p>“Yeah, not a great time, Principal Max,” Agatha said through her teeth, her hands still tangled in Kara’s hair. “Students, can anyone <em> quietly </em> raise their hand, and tell Principal Max our school mascot?”</p><p>“An owl!”</p><p>“A fairy!”</p><p>“A TURTLE!” </p><p>They were genuinely screaming now, and Agatha stood up, abandoning the tape. </p><p>Wanda was unfazed. “I wanted to introduce you to your student teacher—”</p><p>“A giraffe!”</p><p>“A human!”</p><p>Agatha glanced at the kids, counting down from five to no avail, and out of the corner of her eye, saw a figure move into the room behind Wanda. Agatha’s eyes fell on the woman’s face. Her very <em> familiar </em> face. Why did she look so familiar?</p><p>“Octopus,” Oliver yelled. “No, a monster!”</p><p>Nicky pulled on his shorts, finally, and turned to face the class, hands over his ears.</p><p>“It’s a river otter, you <em> fucking idiots</em>!”</p><p>The room fell silent at the pitch of his yell. Agatha caught the stifled laugh on Wanda’s face, but she couldn’t focus enough to deal with Nicky. Her eyes were still on the woman standing behind her. </p><p>For five impossibly long seconds, Agatha‘s scanned her face: the dark eyes, the line of her jaw. She knew this woman, she realized faintly. She felt her face and her posture like a word on the tip of her tongue. </p><p>Then, with a deafening, shuddering shift, she remembered. Her <em> tongue</em>. Tucked in the side of her cheek. The press of knees into her thighs. Her own fingernails leaving half moons dented in her palms. Lights, lace, high heels pressed against her—<em>pink, black, green— </em></p><p>The world narrowed, her vision tunneling. Blood roared in her ears, swallowing the crescendo of kid-yells. No. <em> No, no, no</em>. Not her. <em> Please, God, anyone but her. </em>She gripped the edge of the desk behind her to keep herself upright. </p><p>Agatha blinked at Wanda, trying and failing to focus.</p><p>“You didn’t forget already, did you?” Wanda muttered, eyeing her strangely, and then turned to the class. “Students, this is…?” She trailed off, looking at the woman expectantly.</p><p>“Hi everyone. I’m Ms. V.”</p><p>She looked at Agatha, and extended a hand. “Rio.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t move. It was her, she was sure of it—the dancer from the club on the last day of school. A <em> stripper </em> was standing in her classroom, addressing her students. A stripper who, until this moment, had been filed neatly into the category of <em> things Agatha would never think about again. </em> (Except that one time, when she got too drunk on the Fourth of July. And that other time, when she got too drunk on the Seventh of July, which was just a normal Tuesday.) And yet here <em> she </em> was, in practical jeans and a black tee, looking every inch like a competent professional.</p><p>Agatha was supposed to teach alongside this woman. A woman who had, not three months ago, given her a lap dance that, according to her brain’s treacherous, seductive little whisper, had been nothing short of <em>fucking</em> <em>incredible.</em></p><p>Agatha shoved that thought aside with brute force, and shook Rio’s hand in a daze, her arm acting separately from her body.</p><p>“You’re right,” Wanda whispered to Nicky, taking mercy on Agatha. “River otters. Even though there were some other words in there you probably shouldn’t have said, right?”</p><p>“Sorry,” Nicky mumbled, his eyes avoiding Agatha’s with surprising skill as he walked back to his seat.</p><p>“How can I help?” Rio asked, her voice startlingly quiet. Her gaze flicked between Agatha and the chaos in the room, and she set her bag down behind Agatha’s desk as if it already belonged there.</p><p>“I don’t—” The words caught her throat. She saw Wanda’s raised eyebrows and felt the weight of her silent <em> get it together </em> glare. Agatha cleared her throat. “Take Kara to the nurse and get the tape out of her hair,” she said, her eyes fixed on the back wall.</p><p>“Got it.” Rio moved without hesitation. She crouched beside Kara, speaking to her in a low, soothing voice. Somehow, impossibly, the tears stopped. Agatha watched in stunned silence as Kara’s hand slipped into Rio’s, and the two of them walked effortlessly out the door.</p><p>Wanda lingered for a moment, her expression inscrutable. Then she closed the door behind her, leaving Agatha alone in a room full of second graders who, miraculously, were silent.</p><p>Agatha gripped the edge of her desk again and took a breath. She resisted the urge to run to her car just to hyperventilate in private. The last time she’d felt this close to a full-blown panic at work was seven years ago, sitting in the same green-tiled bathroom that still stood down the hall, staring at two pink lines on a plastic stick. But twenty-seven pairs of eyes were watching her, waiting to hear about river otters. So she exhaled, pushed Rio to the outside the edges of her mind, and clicked to the next slide.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Rio returned at the tail end of lunch. Agatha watched as Kara, now Jolly-Rancher-equipped and all smiles, gave Rio a hug in the hallway. Agatha braced herself as Rio approached, the two of them finally alone under the paper tree canopy. She had done such an effective job of pushing the thought of Rio out of her mind, it was like she was recognizing her all over again, the features of her face coming into focus. She looked <em> ordinary, h</em>er hair tied back and face bare of makeup. But her eyes—they were the same, weren’t they? They <em> felt </em> the same. And despite the simplicity of her look, there was still something striking about her. That thing Agatha didn’t have a name for that made it so difficult to look away.</p><p>“Uh, she’s fine,” Rio said, gesturing toward the door where Kara had disappeared. “She took a while to calm down, but the nurse cut the tape out. She’ll never know the difference—that kid has amazing hair.” She smiled, and Agatha felt something in her stomach twist in cold realization: Rio didn’t recognize her.</p><p>The relief was immediate and overwhelming. But beneath it, she felt a tiny pinprick of disappointment. She shook the thought away, embarrassed at herself.</p><p>“Is everything okay?” Rio asked, her brow furrowing as she stepped closer to the desk. “Look, I know this was a last-minute reassignment, and I know you’re extremely busy. But I’m looking forward to working with you, and I know my way around a school—I promise, I will make this as easy as possible.”</p><p>Agatha forced herself to speak, her throat feeling dry. “No,” she said. “I mean, yes. Yes, everything is fine. It’s fine. I’m sure this will be…good.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio said. She seemed unbothered by Agatha’s incoherence, and shoved her hands in her pockets. “I emailed you my proposed teaching schedule. If we can go over it tomorrow, I would appreciate your input.”</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha said, impressed even above the wave of panic. “Yes, sure.”</p><p>Rio smiled again, and took her first real look around the classroom. She wandered slowly, fingertips grazing paper vines and skimming book spines. She stopped at the reading corner, her eyes scanning the felt animals. “Did you do all of this yourself?” she asked, her hand resting on the trunk of the paper tree. </p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said again, unable to keep the pride from creeping into the single word.</p><p>“Wow, Agatha. This classroom is <em> amazing</em>.”</p><p>Rio looked at her with genuine admiration, and Agatha felt startled by the casual ease with which she'd addressed her. Usually the student teachers were younger, more uncertain. Scared of her, even.</p><p>“What?” Rio said, arching a brow. “You’re not one of those teachers who makes adults call them by their teacher name, are you? Or am I supposed to call you 'Ms. Harkness,' like a seven-year-old?”</p><p>Agatha let out an involuntary laugh, and she smoothed a hand over her hair in an attempt to gather her bearings. Any of her bearings. Where the <em> fuck </em> were her bearings?</p><p>“God, no,” Agatha said. “Of course not.”</p><p>“I figured.” </p><p>Agatha watched, her head still spinning, as Rio’s hands brushed and inspected and danced over the objects in her classroom. For a minute, Agatha tried to convince herself that maybe this wasn’t the same woman she had met that night. Maybe this was someone else, maybe her mind was playing tricks on her after a long, brutal summer. But the way Rio’s hips swayed, the subtle roll of her shoulders, the confidence threaded through her every motion were unmistakable. This was the dancer: Reaper, Lady Death, River of Life. Rio.</p><p>She thought about the signposts that lined the rest of her summer. The grout between the shower tiles, the steady drip of the bathroom faucet, and the rest of the conspicuous cracks in her house that seemed to suddenly emerge once it was empty. She remembered the nagging feeling that she could hide in one of the corners, folding into nothing, and the world would just move on. </p><p>Maybe that’s why she couldn't let it go, couldn’t stop feeling the barbs catch on an old, familiar scar. The answer couldn’t be something as simple as a fallible memory. The apparent truth was much worse: that even when she looked into Josh’s face and felt nothing, even on that sidewalk, bathed in a neon glow, <em>she </em> was the one who'd been forgettable all along. Maybe that’s why, when Rio finally turned to face her, Agatha braced her hand on the desk and said, incredulous: “You don’t remember me?”</p><p>The bell rang, punctuating her question, and silence followed. For a split second, Rio’s confusion deepened into something closer to dread, and Agatha felt the faintest, most shameful flicker of satisfaction at seeing her own panic reflected back at her. But there was no spark of recognition. Rio frowned and turned to help the first student with the clasps on her lunchbox, smoothing invisible flyaways at her temples.</p><p>Little bodies spilled into the room, laughter ringing loudly. Rio slipped into the background, and Agatha stepped into the center of it all, steadying her hands. Right now, there was only teaching. But as soon as the bell rang, the final toll of her twentieth Doomsday, she was going to find Wanda.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Agatha gave Nicky one last hug in the parking lot, long enough to draw a deep, grounding breath but short enough not to let her mind wander to Josh. Then she turned to Jen and hugged her, too, knocking her baseball cap askew. Her earrings swung wildly from the force of the attack.</p><p>Jen had been Agatha’s student in her very first year of teaching. Even once she went to college, she'd come back to volunteer at every school event, bringing Agatha coffee and Bugles, their shared guilty pleasure. Now twenty-seven, she was the youngest assistant principal in the school’s history. </p><p>Jen had once driven three miles out of her way to return a kid’s single lost mitten, complaining all the while, and she'd babysat Nicky since he was in diapers. If there was anyone Agatha trusted to hand Nicky off to Josh, and spare herself the fresh hell of doing it in front of a crowd, it was Jen.</p><p>“Everything good, H?” Jen eyed Agatha. “Haven’t heard from you in a while.” </p><p>Agatha had told Jen years ago to start calling her by her first name, but Jen could never stomach making the switch, even at twenty-seven. The most she could manage was dropping the “Mrs.”</p><p>“Yup, all good,” Agatha replied, counting the kids for the fourth time. </p><p>“You sure?” </p><p>Agatha sighed. “She told you, didn’t she?”</p><p>“Told me? I was <em> at </em>the meeting.”</p><p><em> The school board meeting. </em>Not her marriage, although Jen presumably knew about that too. She'd always had a frustrating way of knowing everything, even at age seven. </p><p>“Right. Sorry. I was a little…” Agatha trailed off, searching for the right word.</p><p>“Crazy-town?” Jen offered. </p><p>“Good to see you, J,” Agatha said instead of answering, and made her brisk escape.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>She reached the front office in record time, and Sharon greeted her with an exaggerated gasp of delight.</p><p>“There she is!” She stood from her desk to envelop Agatha in a cloud of rose perfume. “I was wondering when I’d get to see you.”</p><p>She leaned back, her smile faltering. “Oh, honey. You look awful.”</p><p>Agatha forced herself to smile. “Hi, Sharon. Love the honesty, as always. I really need to talk to her. It’s an emergency.”</p><p>Sharon’s expression softened with the practiced concern of someone who handled a daily barrage of ‘emergencies.’ Agatha liked to think hers always took priority, but Sharon was unfortunately great at her job, so she was never sure.</p><p>“Oh, my. Go ahead; she’s not in right now, but I’ll let her know you’re here.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Agatha muttered, slipping into the cool interior of Wanda’s office. The room was dark, a reprieve from the late-afternoon sun streaming through the rest of the building. Agatha paced its length, listening to her own rhythmic thuds against the carpet. She felt that if she sat down, even for a second, she would sink so deeply into the chair, the night custodian would have to dig her out. She didn’t know how long she’d been pacing when the door creaked open, admitting two streaks of movement, followed by Wanda, a hand to her own head.</p><p>“Hey, boys,” Agatha said, fist bumping Billy and Tommy. </p><p>“Hey, Agatha,” they said in unison. Wanda collapsed in her chair as Billy and Tommy tossed a plastic ball at each other.</p><p>“How’s fourth grade treating you?” Agatha asked. </p><p>“Too slow.” Tommy whipped the ball across the desk, and Wanda shielded her face, grimacing.</p><p>“It’s okay,” Billy added diplomatically, bending to retrieve where it had fallen.</p><p>Wanda sighed. “Boys, you can head home. Remember to stay in the bike lane, okay?”</p><p>Tommy took off first. Billy, a little slower, gave Agatha a quick wave, and she winked at him. </p><p>“Wear your helmets!” Wanda called after them.</p><p>The door clicked shut to silence, and Wanda slumped even further in her chair.</p><p>Agatha looked at her. “Hey, why is it that my kid calls you ‘Aunt Wanda,’ and your kids just call me 'Agatha?'”</p><p>“Because your son is civilized,” Wanda said. “Why, do you <em> want </em> them to call you ‘Aunt Agatha?’”</p><p>“<em>Fuck,</em> no. I’m not one hundred years old.”</p><p>“Glad that’s settled.” Wanda put her head in her hand. “Please don’t tell me that I came all the way here just for you to ask me <em> that</em>.”</p><p>“Rough day?” Agatha asked with a smirk.</p><p>“Doomsday? <em> Never</em>. Today is when parents are famously their most relaxed and gracious." </p><p>Agatha took a deep breath and squared her shoulders. “Listen, I can’t do this student teacher thing.”</p><p>Wanda groaned. “It’s been half a day! You’re not even going to try? Your job literally depends on it.”</p><p>“I’m sure she’s... skilled,” Agatha said, wincing at her own words. “I mean, I’m sure she’s good. At <em> teaching</em>. And… things. Look, I’m just saying I can’t do this <em> with her.</em>”</p><p>Wanda’s arms flung out in exasperation. “If she’s good, then why can’t you do it?”</p><p>“Because she’s...” Agatha’s mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water, completely at a loss.</p><p><em> Because she’s a stripper. Which I know because, on the last day of school, I accidentally ended up at a strip club in Boston with my husband—who, by the way, is not my husband anymore. And he paid </em> <em>her to ride me against a wooden bench in a manner that would definitely not be shown on network TV. And by the way, she has a great tattoo of the Tree of Life—not in a biblical way, though—which isn’t important, except I can’t stop thinking about it. Also, the way her hips move, and those goddamn eyes. And I can’t do this because this is my place of work, at least for a little while longer, barring any major catastrophes. And this is one big monumental fucking catastrophe waiting to happen. </em></p><p>“It’s just... fast," she said instead. "I mean, what do we even know about her, really?”</p><p>Wanda gave her a long, piercing look. “‘What do we <em> know </em> about her?’ That’s what you’ve got?” Her eyes narrowed, and she tilted her head. “You’ve had five student teachers, two since I’ve been here. Both turned out fine, and, if I recall, you gave them glowing recommendations." </p><p>Agatha shifted her weight from foot to foot, her eyes landing on the cork board above Wanda’s head. A handful of red push pins formed a crude smiley face. She locked onto it stubbornly, the sudden, acute sensation washing over her that she was a fifth-grader, holding court in front of Principal Max.</p><p>“Am I missing something here?” Wanda pressed. “Is it because she’s thirty and not twenty-two?”</p><p>“God, of course not,” Agatha said quickly. “That’s <em>way</em> better<em>. </em> She knows what she’s doing. She’s confident. She’s not afraid to advocate for herself.”</p><p>“Then I’m lost,” Wanda said, scrubbing a hand over her face before leaning both elbows against the desk. She leveled Agatha with a look. “From where I’m sitting, it sounds like she made a good first impression.”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip so hard she almost drew blood. The truth was on the tip of her tongue, just shy of tumbling out. She took in the shadows under Wanda's eyes, her sleeves rolled up to her elbows. She thought about the hoops Wanda had jumped through for her—the ones she knew about and the ones she didn’t. For the first time all day, Agatha felt something poke through the thick haze of her own panic. She couldn’t drop this on Wanda, not after this summer. Not on Doomsday. Agatha let out a slow, steady breath.</p><p>“Like you said. This summer was a fucking disaster.”</p><p>“I don’t think I said ‘disaster.” Wanda's lips curved lightly, her head resting in her hand.</p><p>“I read between the lines."</p><p>Agatha kept her gaze steady on the red push-pin smiley. It stared back at her, dead in the eyes. She heard the click of her own jaw as she clenched and released.</p><p>“One semester?” she said finally, looking back at her friend.</p><p>Wanda watched her carefully. “One semester.”</p><p>Agatha tapped her foot, then gave a single, sharp nod. “Fine.”</p><p>“Oh, thank god,” Wanda groaned, throwing her arms up in triumph. “It’s a miracle!”</p><p>“Shut up,” came Agatha’s grumbled reply.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped outside, and stopped short. The parking lot had mostly emptied, the asphalt shimmering faintly in the late afternoon sun. But there was Nicky, his small hand tucked securely in Jen’s. And on his other side stood Rio. Agatha had been so hellbent on talking to Wanda about her, she'd forgotten to tell her she could leave.</p><p>Agatha looked at her watch, a familiar irritation flaring, and she walked towards them with purpose. Josh’s car rolled up just as she reached them, and she didn’t stop until she was leaning into the open window, the air conditioning and the sharp scent of his cologne slamming her in the face. </p><p>“I told you three o’clock,” she said, skipping the formalities. “It’s three-thirty; where the fuck have you been?”</p><p>"I know, I know,” Josh said. “I’m sorry I’m late; I got caught up at work, and my boss wanted—”</p><p>Agatha leaned farther in, lowering her voice. “I don’t care if your boss wanted you to chop down a tree and fuck him with it. When I say three o’clock, you need to be here to get him at three o’clock.”</p><p>“Wow. That’s…descriptive." Josh rubbed at his face. “You really want to do this <em> here</em>? The whole, ‘I’m perfect, you’re an idiot’ routine? It’s getting a little redundant.”</p><p>“Not as redundant as blasting the AC with the windows down.” She held his gaze, letting the contempt settle between them until a purple backpack bobbed in her periphery.</p><p>She folded her arms and stepped back as Josh waved to Nicky, smiling at him with a gentleness that burned. Whatever Josh was—an infuriating man, a mediocre husband—he’d always been a good father. She never managed the ability to twist that fact, no matter how angry she was, which, of course, only made her angrier.</p><p>“Bye, Mama!” Nicky called from the backseat, waving eagerly out the window.</p><p>“I love you, baby.” Her smile felt bright and brittle. “I’ll see you tomorrow.”</p><p>She blew him a kiss, and fought hard against the lump in her throat, willing the tears not come. She felt the panic rise as Nicky grew smaller in the distance through the sedan window. That deep, inexplicable instinct kicked in, screaming at her to sprint across the parking lot, yank the door open, and clutch him to her chest.</p><p>She stood there instead, shallow-breathing with her knees locked. The cars started to blur. Her thumb rubbed hard against her ring finger at the spot her wedding band used to sit. She hadn’t yet lost the habit. She mused that maybe she'd rub the skin on her ring finger and her feet would fuse to the hot asphalt until the car came back in the morning. </p><p>She felt Rio and Jen behind her, silent, and forced herself to take one step, then another. She kept her eyes firmly on the ground as she walked to her car, slamming the door. She curled her fingers above the leather, nails pressing into her closed fist before unclenching slowly. She traced over the faint indents with her fingertips and wondered if anyone else had half-moons on their palms instead of laugh lines.</p><p>Usually, she welcomed the quiet, a much needed reprieve after the sheer noise of the school day. But today, it felt <em>empty</em>—her car, and before that, her ring finger, and before even that, her TV remote. Her forehead fell to the steering wheel, her glasses digging into the bridge of her nose. Here she was, forty-two years old and wearing a twelve year-old t-shirt on the first day of school. Disgraced by her marriage, <em> nearly </em> disgraced by her job, and bookending the summer with an empty back seat. She squeezed her eyes shut against the prick of tears.</p><p>A latch clicked suddenly in the silence. She heard the the pull of metal, and felt the slight dip of the car. Her shoulders jerked upright, and her hand slammed against the horn automatically.</p><p>“Hey!” Rio yelled over the blare, settled comfortably in the back seat.</p><p>Agatha yanked her hand off the wheel, twisting around. She stared.</p><p>“What the fuck—” </p><p>“All the kids are gone,” Rio said smoothly. She gestured toward the school. “Am I going to be doing that every day? Waiting with the last kid?”</p><p>Agatha blinked at her, frustration coiling at Rio’s easy invasion of her space. In one day—or two days, two months apart—Rio had wandered into the wreckage of her marriage and her career. She shook hands, and smiled, and swung her hips as she trampled around like the ruins of Agatha’s life were a tourist attraction. </p><p>“<em>No</em>,” Agatha said emphatically. </p><p>“I mean, I’m more than happy to,” Rio said. “But Jen told me it actually wasn’t my job to wait there at all.” She crossed her arms, and Agatha took in the sheer audacity of this woman, arrogant and indignant in <em> her </em> back seat. </p><p>“Just so you know,” Rio said, “a little suburban hazing isn’t going to throw me. I may be a student teacher, but I’ve been working with kids since I <em> was </em> one, and let’s just say, I’ve seen worse.”</p><p>“I wasn’t…” Agatha stopped herself. She wasn’t going to do this. </p><p>“You know what, yeah. I was <em> hazing </em> you. It builds character.”</p><p>She faced forward again, staring at the sparse shrubbery in front of her parking spot. She tried not to cave, tracing the bare branches of a dying bush with her eyes, but her gaze drifted inevitably back to the rearview mirror. </p><p>Rio was looking at her. And just like that, she was back in the dark, music pulsing, Rio’s gaze burning through her from across the club. The sudden force of the memory made her fingers curl tighter around the wheel. </p><p>“Was there something else?” she asked expectantly, holding her voice even despite the threading of her pulse. Rio looked at her hand, picking absently at her cuticle. </p><p>“Earlier,” she said slowly, “you asked if I remembered you. Have we met?”</p><p>Agatha forced a laugh that she hoped with all of her soul was convincing. </p><p>“Oh, no, I don’t think so,” she said quickly. “You know what it was: I thought I recognized you from the grocery store, last week, but I realized that was a totally <em> different </em> woman I was talking to about the, the new…organic mayonnaise.”</p><p><em> Organic. Fucking. Mayonnaise. Jesus Christ. </em>She clamped her teeth shut, and Rio nodded, lips twitching.</p><p>“You talk to a lot of women in grocery stores about condiments?” </p><p>Agatha felt instantly caught somewhere between mortification, and worse, the urge to laugh.</p><p>“I try not to make it a habit." She adjusted her glasses, hiding, as she often did, behind her ‘polite suburban mother’ persona. Far from the truth, but convenient at times, like when she ‘accidentally’ double-booked her dentist appointments with PTA meetings. Or when a stripper was sitting in her back seat.</p><p>Rio scanned the car, her gaze landing on Nicky’s booster seat beside her. She didn’t mention it, and looked back at Agatha instead. Agatha felt the pit of dread in her stomach creep slowly up her spine. Rio smoothed her fingers over her temple, lingering too long. Agatha noticed it again, the fleeting expression of stress.</p><p>“You know me from the club,” Rio said simply.</p><p>Agatha felt her lungs deflate. The heat bloomed on her cheeks, the light spotting in front of her eyes. She could still deny it—it would be easy, however unconvincing.</p><p>But still, <em> still,</em> an insane little part of her was annoyed. How many people must Rio have seen between then and now for her to have no memory of Agatha at all? How many people each night? How many tragically married, middle-aged women who had come to drunken, hazy revelations underneath her in that curtained pink room?</p><p>“Look, I normally wouldn’t say anything,” Rio continued, taking Agatha’s silence as the confirmation it was. “I’m not trying to pull anything crazy, but you’re friends with the principal. So, does she…did you tell her?” Her tone was conversational, but her knee bounced steadily. Agatha watched it, and shook her head once. </p><p>“Are you going to?” Rio asked.</p><p>Agatha looked at the open question on her face.</p><p>“I haven’t decided yet,” she said finally. “Doesn’t this seem a little…I don’t know…”</p><p>“Inappropriate?” Rio finished, looking at her pointedly. “Unbecoming? Shameful? Go on.”</p><p>Agatha was silent. </p><p>“I’m not, like, dancing for kids; I’m not a criminal,” Rio said, rolling her eyes. “I need a supplemental source of income. I was a caseworker, and now I’m a grad student, and those two things aren’t exactly known for great benefits and a living wage.”</p><p>“Strippers get a lot of benefits, then?” Agatha shot back automatically.</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched again. “Only ones that sue the clubs they work at, and who has the time?” She paused, and then added, “And we prefer being called dancers.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “What’s the difference?”</p><p>“Well for one,” Rio smirked, “I start my shift with my clothes already off.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, trying with every fiber of her being to keep her face neutral.</p><p>“Okay, then why teach at all?” she said. “Why not just be a… <em>dancer </em> full time and make money?”</p><p>Rio looked out the window, scrunching her nose, and took in the deserted playground. She glanced back at Agatha almost sheepishly.</p><p>“Oh, don’t fucking say it,” Agatha said, holding up a hand.</p><p>“I love it,” Rio shrugged. “I’ve always loved it. Kids like me, and they’ve always made more sense to me than adults. I never really get tired of them.”</p><p>“<em>Never</em>?” </p><p>“Okay. Maybe not <em> never,</em>” she admitted. “But I kind of thrive off of the chaos.”</p><p>Agatha was starting to lose the thread of why she was so hellbent on making Rio sweat. Truthfully, she felt the exact same way about kids—they never seemed to turn on her the way adults did.</p><p>Agatha leaned her head back and closed her eyes for a second, taking a deep breath. Maybe this would be fine. If Rio didn’t remember her, then they could just pretend it never happened, and start fresh. Agatha could play nice, for the sake of her career, and as a favor to Wanda. </p><p>“Okay,” she said quietly.</p><p>“If you tell Wanda, I'll be reassigned and—wait, what?” Rio looked at her, surprised.</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha repeated. “It’s your second job; it’s none of my business. I could use a little help this year from someone who knows what they’re doing. And you…seem to. And anyway, it’s not like…I mean, I just saw you from across the room when I was there with my husband, and that’s why I recognized you. It doesn’t have to be, like, this big <em>thing</em>. People meet in passing all the time.”</p><p>Rio smiled to herself, looking down for a second, and then out the window again. She still looked a little surprised.</p><p>“I did mean what I said.” She caught Agatha's eye. “I am excited to be working with you. I can see that you’re a really good teacher.”</p><p>“You saw me teach for like, one hour.”</p><p>“I talked to some older kids at pickup,” Rio smiled. “You know, they were just generally up in my business, wanting to know who the fuck I was. And when I said I was teaching with you—holy shit, it was like a crowd of raving fans. Fans that all had something incredibly personal that they wanted me to tell you.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t stop the pull of a smile. </p><p>“Katie Buckers got a haircut last month,” Rio continued, her face perfectly straight. “She made it very clear to pass that along. And Alejandro said he misses you and he wants to marry you.”</p><p>Agatha laughed then, the familiar spike of love and pride loosening the tension in her neck. She narrowed her eyes.</p><p>“Did you collect flattering testimony in case this conversation went a different way?”</p><p>“In general,” Rio grinned, “I aim to please.”</p><p>The heat rose up Agatha’s throat, drying out her tongue and wiping the smile from her face. <em> Fuck,</em> what was she thinking? Of course she couldn’t forget about it, and of course this was just such a bad, terrible, horrible idea. She swallowed.</p><p>“Can you get out of my car now?” she said, her voice rough to her own ears. “You can’t just get into a stranger’s back seat like a serial killer.”</p><p>Rio stared at her for a second, and then, decisively, she leaned forward. Agatha could feel her breath on the nape of her neck, tickling the wisps that had escaped from her ponytail through the day. She stayed firmly facing forward, her fingers still wrapped tightly around the wheel.</p><p>“We’re not strangers,” Rio said smoothly, her voice low and matter-of-fact. “It was a Friday night in June. You didn’t have glasses, and your hair was down. You were wearing a black jacket, a hideous shirt, and <em> brown </em> pants, which means you hate yourself a little, or you don’t know that you’re too hot to be dressing like an actuary from the eighties, or you didn’t know you were coming to a strip club. Or maybe all three. Your husband paid me fifty bucks, I gave you a lap dance, and you liked it.”</p><p>She leaned back, holding Agatha's eye for a beat. Then she was gone, the car door slamming Agatha into stillness. And once again, she sat there in Rio’s abrupt absence, this time without the haze of tequila, and felt the afterimage of Lady Death’s breath against her ear.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p> </p><blockquote>
<p>“We like to think that we are rational beings; humane, conscientious, civilized, thoughtful. But when things fall apart, even just a little, it becomes clear we are not better than animals. We have opposable thumbs, we think, we walk erect, we speak, we dream, but deep down we are still routing around in the primordial ooze; biting, clawing, scratching out an existence in the cold, dark world like the rest of the tree-toads and sloths.”</p>
<p><strong>-Meredith Grey, </strong> <em><strong> Grey’s Anatomy</strong> </em></p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p> </p><p>The tree behind Agatha’s classroom stretched over the picnic table, the surface dotted with the first few fallen maple leaves of September. Mornings had started to chill, dew settling in the grass, her coffee already starting to cool. The plastic lid of her travel mug was cracked, from when she'd dropped it in the parking lot last year. She kept forgetting to buy a new one, so eventually, she'd resigned herself to lukewarm coffee.</p><p>She tapped her pen against the stack of worksheets in front of her. It was still early, students likely still asleep in their beds, parents just barely stirring. Agatha loved being here before everyone else, drinking in the quiet, still air before it became unrecognizable with commotion.</p><p>A rustle startled her, and she groaned at the sight of Wanda, rocking on her heels five feet away.</p><p>“Nice,” Wanda said. “Not really how friends love to be greeted.”</p><p>“I <em> know </em> that look. You’re about to ruin my morning with some bullshit.”</p><p>Wanda sat on the bench opposite, her own coffee steaming in her hand. “It’s very possible. How are you feeling about tonight?”</p><p>“I was trying not to think about it,” Agatha muttered. “And I was doing pretty well, until you came to my secret spot and forced me to think about it.”</p><p>“Really?” Wanda eyed her pointedly. “You <em>curled</em> your hair. You’re wearing a dress and a push-up bra.”</p><p>“Settle down.” Agatha rolled her eyes, but her cheeks felt warm. It was a specific flavor of humiliation, being caught caring about her self-image.</p><p>It was Back to School Night, and truthfully, she'd been feeling a <em>rather-set-herself-on-fire-and-burn-at-the-stake</em> level of dread. </p><p>“You look good; it’s a good thing,” Wanda said knowingly. “How’s Rio?” </p><p>Wanda kicked her feet idly under the table, and Agatha smiled at the motion, clocking it as another automatic movement that adults seemed to remember in their grown-up bodies.</p><p>“Fine,” Agatha said. “Good. I’m letting her do some of the presentation tonight, so she’s probably off rehearsing. You know how they get.”</p><p>“Does she even know what she’s in for? All the Agatha <em> lore</em>?”</p><p>Agatha huffed but didn’t look up from her papers.</p><p>“You should really tell her what she’s walking into,” Wanda said, “before she’s blindsided by a room full of foaming-at-the-mouth parents.”</p><p>“Is that why you came out here?” Agatha put down her pen. “You want me to tell Rio every humiliating detail of the worst night of my career?”</p><p>“As your friend, I think you’re being paranoid. But as your principal, that particular can of worms is none of my business.”</p><p>“Great,” Agatha said flatly. “Good chat.”</p><p>“You’re giving the closing remarks tonight.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw dropped. “You’re kidding. I'm the last person who should be doing that right now.”</p><p>“You’ve done it before,” Wanda said, unfazed. “And Ralph’s coming.”</p><p>“Ah. It all comes down to a Bohner.”</p><p>“Shut up,” Wanda said with a laugh. “He’s got it out for you, and he’s doing his best to make sure this is your last Back-to-School Night.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Doesn’t he have anything better to do than witch-hunt me?”</p><p>“You have a real talent for motivating that man.”</p><p>Agatha watched as Wanda tilted her head back, taking in the light filtering through the leaves. She closed her eyes for a moment, and Agatha felt an unexpected wave of affection. She remembered what it had been like before Wanda. Paul, the former principal, had left Oyster Bend six years ago for a position at the district office. He'd known Agatha since grad school, where he was a fourth-year PhD student, and her TA, which Agatha found hysterical. Even years ahead and on a PhD track, Paul had never quite been able to keep up with her, a first-year master’s student.</p><p>He'd asked her to dinner on three separate occasions, which she was somewhat sure would never be allowed now, but she hadn't minded so much at the time. Paul was funny and had a nice smile, and she'd actually liked him. But she'd liked Josh better, so she'd said no, and he'd backed off.</p><p>But friendly as he was, he was a mediocre leader, more concerned with keeping up appearances than keeping the school running. If Ralph wanted something, Paul handed it to him without question. If the PTA batted their lashes, he folded. Agatha had learned early that if anything was going to get done, she would have to do it herself. Those pre-Wanda years felt cold and lonely to think about now.</p><p>Wanda sighed. “I don’t think you realize how mad people are.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “Oh, I realize.”</p><p>“No. You don’t.” Wanda’s voice was quieter now. “I’m trying to shield you from it as much as I can. And yeah, a lot of them are fucking crazy—don’t quote me on that—but crazy or not, they can still do some damage.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Since when does ‘crazy’ not matter?”</p><p>“Since you stood up in a public meeting and told half the parents in this town they were bad at raising their kids.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth snapped shut.</p><p>“I get why you said it.” Wanda pressed on. “But you know it wasn’t completely fair. Not all the rich parents are assholes—some of them actually use their money to help this school.”</p><p>Agatha chewed at her bottom lip.</p><p>“If the board decides to push you out, your students lose an incredible teacher. <em> I </em> lose an incredible teacher.” Wanda’s voice wavered slightly. “And there won’t be a single fucking thing I can do about it.”</p><p>“But I just—”</p><p>“Please.” Wanda shook her head, her eyes shining now. “<em>Please </em> don’t get yourself fired, and leave me here to find your replacement. I can handle a lot, but I can’t handle that.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her for a long moment, then sighed. “Okay. Okay. I’m sorry.” She ran a hand through her hair. “I’ll do the remarks. I’ll… try to smooth things over. And I will avoid Ralph.”</p><p>Wanda let out a deep breath, nodding. Agatha reached across the table and squeezed her hand. “I’m not getting fired.”</p><p>“Yeah, well, you’ll forgive me if I don’t completely believe that.”</p><p>Wanda looked at her out of the corner of her eye, and added, “So you’ll tell Rio?”</p><p>“Tell me what?”</p><p>Agatha choked on her coffee, and Wanda whipped around. Rio’s head poked out of the back classroom door.</p><p>"How long have you been there?" Agatha coughed.</p><p>"Who's Ralph?"</p><p>Agatha heard Wanda’s barely stifled laughter as she walked away.</p><p>“Don’t you have a school to run?” Agatha called after her.</p><p>Rio took Wanda’s seat, and Agatha turned her focus back to the papers in front of her.</p><p>It had been two weeks since their conversation in Agatha’s car, and she was still at a loss. With every look Rio threw her way, every confident entrance in the morning, every easy conversation with a student, Agatha felt a distinct restlessness take root in her limbs. There was something unmooring about her. It lingered, like a layer of tissue paper stuck to her insides.</p><p>Worse, it was starting to feel normal, the way Rio broke the morning quiet. At first, Agatha had just stared, incredulous. How could Rio—a dancer, graceful by trade—be so clunky and distracting in a desk? She would throw the door open, black backpack slung over one shoulder, her nose red from the cold. She’d drop into the seat across from Agatha, sniffling lightly. She would pull her hood off her hair, shake it out, and tie it up. Every morning, without meaning to, Agatha would find herself watching. By now, it felt almost rhythmic. Sit. Sniffle. Hood off. Hair up. Laptop. Coffee. </p><p>Coincidentally, Rio drank from the exact same mug as Agatha’s. But Rio’s was infuriatingly spotless, her lid pristine. Her coffee was probably always hot. It set Agatha’s teeth on edge, starting with the matching mug and ending with the way Rio was so at ease around her, slouched with her fingers tapping idly against the wood. Meanwhile, Agatha sat rigid, every muscle stiff in opposition.</p><p>She tried to ignore the way Rio’s mannerisms had started to become familiar. The way she pulled her sweatshirt strings between her teeth when she was thinking. The way she picked at her nails with a furrowed brow. The way she pressed her tongue into the inside of her cheek, something between defiance and amusement. The way her hands and eyes came alive when she talked to the kids. Maybe the most confounding of all—it was impossible to draw a smile from her on purpose. It came when Agatha least expected it, softening, shifting Rio’s face into something entirely different. Like one of those hundred-year-old optical illusions in Nicky’s puzzle books where if you stared long enough, the duck wasn’t a duck anymore. Look away for a second, and when you looked back, it was a rabbit. How many people, over the past hundred years had looked at a duck, only to realize the rabbit had been there all along?</p><p>"What?"</p><p>Agatha blinked. Rio was watching her.</p><p>"Nothing." Agatha shook her hair back and stood, gathering the stack of papers. "Look over these and give me your notes by the end of the day."</p><p>"Didn't you already go through these?" Rio asked, eyeing the purple pen scrawled across the top page.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"So this is a test?"</p><p>"No," Agatha said, pointedly. "This is your job."</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>She felt each hour of the day drag against her temples. Five hours left. Then four. Then one, which was somehow still too many. She tapped her fingers against her desk, restless, unsure if she was trying to will time forward or stop the day from turning to night.</p><p>A small hand was raised to her right. Luca looked around the classroom, eyes landing on Rio, then back to Agatha. He rested his chin in his hand, brown eyes wide and serious beneath his messy hair.</p><p>“I have to talk to Ms. V,” he whispered.</p><p>“Ms. V is a little busy right now.” She looked at Rio, who was flipping through worksheets and clearly listening. Agatha turned stubbornly back to Luca. “I promise I can do my best to answer.”</p><p>Luca swayed from side to side, considering, and shook his head. Agatha forced a smile over the quick sting. She beckoned Rio with a short nod of her head, and returned to her desk. The next time she looked up, Rio was settled cross-legged on the carpet, listening intently with her head tipped toward Luca. Agatha's stomach flipped at the sight, and she turned her gaze back to the drag of the wall clock.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Rio leaned against the door with a sigh, fingers curled loosely around the handle. Agatha recognized the familiar end-of-day exhaustion in her eyes, but something else lingered underneath. Rio leaned for another second, then picked up a stack of papers.</p><p>“Can we go through these now?”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. Unease needled at her, and turned quickly to annoyance. Rio was keeping something from her.</p><p>“Sure,” Agatha said finally. She strode to the back of the room, settling into her armchair, and crossed her legs under her purple dress.</p><p>“Go ahead,” she said, gesturing at the empty rug. Rio paused, tongue in cheek. Then, she plucked a carpet square from the stack and dropped it in front of the chair. She looked Agatha right in the eye, and lowered herself onto the floor with deliberate ease. Agatha had meant to get under her skin, but now Rio was sitting on the floor, looking up at her through her lashes, and Agatha felt a prickle of heat at the base of her throat. She blinked and looked away.</p><p>“You need to stop acting so weird around me," Rio said finally. "People are going to notice.”</p><p>“What?” Agatha spluttered. “I’m not—<em>I’m </em> acting normal. <em> You're</em> the one that’s acting like you live here, interrupting my mornings every fucking day, sitting down right across from me with nothing to say!"</p><p>“If I’m not saying anything, how am I interrupting?” </p><p>“Because you’re—” Agatha stopped, then leaned forward. “Stop looking at me like we have this…big <em> secret</em>.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “But we do.”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Rio groaned. “I’m just doing my job. You need to actually <em> look </em> at me to observe my teaching. What's it going to take for you to get over it? It’s not like I’m going to suddenly forget where I am and climb on top of you in your fucking armchair.”</p><p>Agatha’s brain short-circuited. Rio, in her lap. Legs bracketing her thighs, hands bracing the chair. Her fingers curling into the blue fabric, into her hair, into—<em>Jesus fucking Christ. </em></p><p>She grabbed her coffee, desperate for a distraction. The second the bitter taste hit her tongue, she choked, coughing. She spit the sip straight back into the cup.</p><p>“That’s mine,” Rio said.</p><p>“I gathered.”</p><p>Agatha fumed, looking down at the mug she'd just spit into, and then handed it to Rio. “Tonight’s a big night,” she said. “I’m thinking about other things besides you, if you can believe it.”</p><p>“<em>Besides </em> me?” Rio grinned. She looked at the mug, and then, her eyes back on Agatha, she took a slow, deliberate sip. It was so obscenely <em> wrong</em>—the way Agatha felt her breathing shallow. She blinked, hard. </p><p>“What did Luca want?”</p><p>“I can’t tell you.”</p><p>Agatha stared. “What do you mean you <em> can’t tell me</em>?”</p><p>“If I tell you right now, you’re going to be distracted tonight.”</p><p>Agatha stared, and Rio angled her body away from Agatha’s gaze.</p><p>“We need to talk about those first,” Rio said, nodding to the small posters lining the bookshelf. “Are you keeping them up tonight?”</p><p>“Since when do you care about my taste in classroom decor?”</p><p>“Since I noticed that.” Rio pointed at a laminated quote. "‘Somewhere inside all of us is the power to change the world.’ Roald Dahl. You know he was, like, wildly racist and sexist, right?"</p><p>Agatha froze. “What? No. Was he?”</p><p>“That’s kind of his thing."</p><p>Agatha gaped at her, then at the quote. “His <em> thing </em> is <em> James and the Giant Peach,</em> not racism, or everyone would fucking know that, including me.”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “He also claimed women were biologically inferior to men, which I personally disagree with, but you know, it’s your classroom—”</p><p>Agatha was already at the bookcase, yanking the quote down. She crumpled it and threw it in the trash.</p><p>“How long were you going to let me leave that up there?” </p><p>“I just saw it today,” Rio said with a grin. “You've got to do your research.”</p><p>“Oh, please. Like you didn’t love his books before you knew he was a raging idiot. By all means, come up with a replacement.”</p><p>“How about, ‘I had some help in becoming who I am?’” Rio said theatrically, her arm raised in front of her. A piece of paper fluttered out of the folder in her hand. She reached for it, and Agatha caught the shift in her smile.</p><p>“Tell me about Luca,” Agatha said, her curiosity piquing again.</p><p>Rio looked at her. She hesitated for a beat, and then held out the yellow note in acquiescence. “He has a crush."</p><p>Agatha looked at the shakily drawn heart and laughed, relieved. “<em>That’s </em> why he didn’t want to talk to me; it happens every year. I’m a notorious heart-breaker in the second grade.”</p><p>Rio smiled. “Not on <em> you</em>. On Nicky.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Oh. Wow, okay. I don’t think Nicky's had any crushes yet, because he can barely dress himself. So I don’t think they’re a relationship in the making, but I still don’t see the problem.”</p><p>Rio’s shoulders relaxed, and she grinned. “Hey, I had my first crush when I was five. Mrs. Archambeau. I was the only one that could say her name, so she gave me a ladybug sticker, and that sealed the deal. Nice, hot, and definitely the head bitch in charge.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “So that would be your type, then?” </p><p>They both seemed to realize what she said at the same time, and Agatha felt the acute need to sink into the chair. A flicker of surprise flashed across Rio’s face, and Agatha wasn’t sure if she was imagining it, but she could swear she saw a tinge of pink across her cheeks.</p><p>“I’m just saying,” Rio continued, conspicuously ignoring the question, “that Nicky <em> could </em> have a crush. He might not, but it’s not really a blanket age thing.”</p><p>“Fair enough,” Agatha said, clearing her throat, and then paused as another thought occurred to her. “Wait, you didn’t think I was going to be…I don’t know, some raging homophobe, did you?”</p><p>Rio laughed at that, the sound tumbling out of her. She was still sitting cross-legged on the carpet.</p><p>“You never know,” she shrugged and then added, “When we met, you didn’t seem very… comfortable.”</p><p>“Jesus,” Agatha hissed, glancing automatically toward the door. “Just because I’d never been to a fucking <em> strip club </em> doesn’t mean I’m a bigot. I live in the suburbs, not the middle ages.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio said, arms raised in surrender, “point taken, and for the record, I’m glad.”</p><p>She paused, fiddling with the edge of the carpet square. “Luca told me some kids were bothering him about it at lunch today. He wouldn’t tell me their names, but he said he'd tell me if it happened again, so I was going to keep an eye out tomorrow. I wanted to wait and check it out, just in case you…” She stopped herself, and rubbed the back of her neck, confirming what Agatha had suspected. “Just in case.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart lurched. There it was, the reason for Rio’s sad smile.</p><p>“I know,” Rio said, eyeing her face. “So do we tell his parents tonight, or wait until tomorrow?” </p><p>"Wait."</p><p>Rio looked at her curiously. "Why?"</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. She sat back in her chair, fingers fidgeting against the armrests, eyes fixed back on the clock.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Agatha sent Rio home for a couple hours, and when she came back, Agatha was notably impressed. She'd changed into a navy blue suit, her pants tapered under a crisp blazer. Her white shirt was buttoned up to the collar, and her hair fell in loose waves over her shoulder. Agatha hadn’t seen her wear makeup since the night at the club, and she stared at the bold eyeliner and touch of pink.</p><p>“Nice,” she said finally.</p><p>“Thanks.” Rio looked at Agatha’s purple dress, the loose top with the long sleeves and pencil skirt that fell just above the knee. “You too.” </p><p>“I’ve been wearing this all day.”</p><p>“I know."</p><p>Agatha felt the tug of a smile and bit it back, turning to organize the papers on her desk that were already in neat piles. Rio turned away as the first parents arrived, and Agatha forced herself to follow suit. The room filled gradually, some greeting her warmly, others more stiffly. They looked up at her classroom, just like their kids, at the leaves and the tree and the vines. Fewer of their faces lit up. It was much less satisfying to watch.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The predictability of her presentation was comforting—first-time mothers scribbling notes, repressed fathers shifting at the mention of <em> social-emotional learning</em>, PTA moms exchanging conspiratorial glances.</p><p>“This year, I’m thrilled to introduce my student teacher, who will be co-teaching this semester,” Agatha said, gesturing to Rio. “I’m going to let her introduce herself."</p><p>Agatha sat down at her desk to the polite smattering of applause, eyes shifting sideways to take in Rio's effortless confidence. No nervous shifting, no filler words. At Agatha's first Back-to-School Night, she’d gripped the sides of the clunky projector cart so tightly her knuckles had turned white, but Rio spoke as if stage fright was a foreign concept. Maybe a classroom presentation wasn’t so nerve-wracking in comparison with dancing naked in front of strangers.</p><p>Judging by the silence, Rio's calm assurance was contagious. Agatha exhaled, half-impressed, half-relieved. At least whatever it was—that <em> thing, </em>the way Rio drew people in, made them lean forward—was apparently universal.</p><p>“My teaching philosophy,” Rio was saying, and Agatha watched her hands as she spoke, “is that students learn best when they’re in a safe, affirming environment. This means leading by example with communication, active listening, and inclusivity of all identities, family structures, and lived experiences.”</p><p>The slide behind Rio was simple: a tiny cartoon of a blended family and a small rainbow flag. Still, Agatha felt it coming, like the wind before a heavy rain. She watched the rustle of unease.</p><p>A woman raised her hand from the back row, and Agatha’s stomach turned. She recognized the expression—sweet, rehearsed, and laced with just enough plausible deniability to claim innocence. It was the face of someone who ‘just had a quick question,’ that turned into a polite opinion, that turned into a crusade. Agatha opened her mouth to intervene, but Rio called on her first.</p><p>“Isn’t all of <em> this, </em> kind of… a lot for second-graders?” she said, looking Rio up and down. “Why do we have to force this stuff on them so early, you know? What does ‘identity’ have to do with math and reading?”</p><p>Rio paused, and Agatha ground her teeth together, bracing her hands on the desk to stand.</p><p>“Great question,” Rio said, smiling, and Agatha froze. She recognized <em>that</em> expression, too.</p><p>"As I mentioned, I’m a student teacher,” she said. “Which means I’m required to stay up to date on the latest education research. Studies show that when students are given structured spaces and trusting adults that affirm their identities—like race, gender, and sexual orientation—they report higher rates of perceived safety at school. And higher perceived safety leads to better overall academic performance.”</p><p>The woman blinked, clearly taken aback.</p><p>Rio smiled again, tilting her head. “Or, as you put it—‘math and reading.’”</p><p>Agatha felt every creak of a desk like a pinprick against her skin. The entire back row was whispering now, heads ducked close, eyes flicking toward Agatha every so often.</p><p>Rio continued with unhurried precision, and Agatha forced herself to focus on the presentation, nodding at the appropriate times. All she wanted was for every single parent to get out of her classroom, and it took thirteen excruciating minutes to get her wish.</p><p>Agatha and Rio stood on either side of the door as the parents trickled out, until only two remained.</p><p>“Josh couldn’t make it?” Oliver’s mother asked. Kara’s mother nudged her, hard, and Agatha pretended not to notice.</p><p>“You know, I think we’ve got it covered, since Nicky’s in my class,” she said sweetly.</p><p>“That’s right,” the woman replied, matching her tone. “It must be hard for him, with everything going on at home. I don’t know <em> how </em> you do it. How’s he doing?”</p><p>“Great.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t offer anything else, and they took the hint, walking out with one final look of pity. Their hushed remarks echoed back into the classroom.</p><p>“Her husband leaves her, she gets drugged up and loses her mind at the school board meeting, and her new student teacher is a <em> lesbian</em>?”</p><p>“Oh, I know. I don’t know if I should call <em> US Weekly </em> or my pastor.”</p><p>Their voices faded down the hall, and Rio snorted, shutting the door behind them.</p><p>“Don’t do it,” she said, her voice laced with amusement.</p><p>Agatha snapped her head toward her. “Don’t do what?”</p><p>“Fight them in the parking lot. Not worth it.”</p><p>“Josh didn’t <em> leave me. </em>And I was not ‘<em>drugged up’ </em> at that meeting.”</p><p>“Well, at least they got mine right,” Rio said, gathering papers off the desks. She widened her eyes, her voice an exaggerated, haunting whisper: “Lesbian. OoOOooh.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t laugh. She picked at an octopus sticker a kid had left on the door, scraping at the cheap laminate. It curled under her nail in uneven patches, the sticky residue fused stubbornly to the wood. Too far gone to peel clean, and definitely too far gone to still resemble an octopus. </p><p>“Were you going to tell me about that slide, by the way?” She'd meant it to sound casual, but knew as soon as the words left her mouth that she'd failed.</p><p>Rio straightened slowly, turning to face her.</p><p>“What slide?” she asked, too measured. </p><p>Agatha ran her tongue over her teeth. “Never call on parents until the last five minutes. That way they can’t derail the whole presentation.”</p><p>“Just to be clear,” Rio said, crossing her arms, “you’re telling me I should have handled that woman’s question by… not letting her ask it in the first place?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said without hesitation. “And you should have run all of that by me first. I agree with you, but there are buzzwords that are going to cause a whole thing with parents here, and trust me, you don’t want to a target on your back in this school district.”</p><p>Rio set the papers down on the desk next to her, too hard.</p><p>“This is <em> Oyster Bend, Massachusetts,</em>” she said, her voice low. “I’ve worked in city shelters and group homes where kids are just trying to make it to school in one piece because they live in an epicenter of gun violence. What you have on your back are white-wine-drinking playground bullies—not a <em> target</em>.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach tightened, and Rio came closer.</p><p>“So many of these kids have the luxury to think beyond their immediate needs, but that brings a whole different set of issues, doesn't it? Some of these parents have never lived anywhere else. They throw their money and influence at the things that scare them, which includes people like me. But kids like Luca need teachers like me. <em> I </em> needed teachers like me.”</p><p>She took a step closer. “And unlike you, I don’t change my mind about what I believe based on who’s watching.”</p><p>The bitterness rose quickly in Agatha’s throat at the humiliation of being lectured in her own classroom.</p><p>“You think you’re so enlightened,” she snapped, stepping forward, “because you know which authors are canceled and which identity terms will send the suburban moms into a spiral. That woman who tried to derail you with her little microaggression? That was <em> Luca’s mom,</em> by the way.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flickered in recognition.</p><p>“You have to know what you can say in front of whom,” Agatha pressed. “Because it’s <em> always </em> going to come back to the kids. What good are you going to do Luca if his mom decides to transfer him out of this class, or this school?”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer.</p><p>“You pretend to be so <em> cool </em> with everything,<em> </em>so unapologetic,” Agatha continued. “But you still lie about your job.”</p><p>"That's different." Rio was completely still now.</p><p>Agatha let out a humorless laugh. “Wanda asked me what your bartending hours were yesterday.” She tilted her head. <em> “ </em> A <em> bartender? </em>Nice. You’re a fucking stripper, Rio. So forgive me if I’m having a hard time standing here, taking judgment from <em> you, </em>of all people.”</p><p>Rio’s nostrils flared, her mouth parted in rare, visible anger. </p><p>“God, Agatha, you’re no different than them. Those annoying, ignorant, gossiping parents. You <em> hate </em> them. But all you want is their approval."</p><p>She swung her arms. “You just switch between whichever Agatha gets you an ounce of control. The depressed, married lady about to fucking <em> jump </em> me after a fifty-dollar dance—”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped.</p><p>“—or the teacher who tells me off for being <em> unprofessional, </em>when all I did was tell the truth.”</p><p>Agatha could feel her nails digging into her palms, the sharp pulse in her throat. Somehow, she couldn't think of a single thing to say.</p><p>Rio’s voice softened, which Agatha felt was even worse than the yelling.</p><p>“You don’t even <em> know </em> which Agatha you actually are, do you?”</p><p>Agatha turned sharply and yanked the door open. She set off at a reckless pace toward the auditorium, and knew that Rio wouldn’t follow.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>She ran into Ralph outside the bathroom, talking to Jen. She almost cursed, then remembered her promise to Wanda this morning, and moved to walk around them.</p><p>“Agatha,” Ralph called, his tweed blazer looking two sizes too big on his wiry frame. “Good to see you.”</p><p>Agatha snorted before disguising it as a cough, glancing at Jen.</p><p>“President Bohner,” she said, saluting lightly.</p><p>“I’ve asked you repeatedly to call me Ralph.”</p><p>She smirked. “Yes, but President Bohner seems more <em>official</em>, don’t you think?”</p><p>Jen pressed her lips together, clearly trying to keep a straight face. Agatha shook her hair back over her shoulder, standing a little taller. She could still feel the tension twisting in her chest, but this, at least, she knew how to handle.</p><p>“I hear you have a student teacher,” Ralph said.</p><p>“I hear it was partly your idea.”</p><p>“We all thought it would be beneficial.”</p><p>“‘We?’” Agatha repeated. “Who, you and <em> Paul</em>? Let me guess, you guys get together every week over Shirley Temples to talk about me?”</p><p>“Bourbon,” Ralph said lightly, but his jaw tightened.</p><p>“Oh, come on. Bourbon is no good for Paul’s weak stomach. In grad school he used to throw up after three beers, and I recall a district Christmas party where <em>someone</em>,” she pushed a finger into his chest playfully, “ate half the bottle of maraschino cherries.”</p><p>Ralph gritted his teeth through his smile, but he fell silent.</p><p>“Anyway,” Agatha said, “I am <em> so </em> flattered, Bohner, but just imagine what you could do for the school with all that time you spend coming up with <em> beneficial ideas </em>for me.”</p><p>Jen finally cleared her throat, straightening the lapels of her pink blazer. She looked a little like she was trying not to choke, and shot Agatha a look. Agatha pointedly ignored it.</p><p>“Well, listen—I know you’ve been having a tough start this year,” Ralph said smoothly. “Hopefully that hasn’t interfered with your collaborative spirit.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, but it felt more like baring her teeth.</p><p>“We work very well together," she said sharply. "Like Thelma and Louise.”</p><p>Rio’s voice echoed in her head. <em> You don’t even know which Agatha you actually are. </em></p><p>“That’s wonderful. Where is she?” Ralph peered behind her. “I’d love to be introduced.”</p><p>“Lady trouble.” Agatha gestured vaguely to her abdomen.</p><p>Ralph blinked and adjusted his blazer.</p><p>“Right… well.” He cleared his throat. “I'm looking forward to your remarks.”</p><p>He turned down the hall, and as soon as he was out of earshot, Jen whirled on her.</p><p>“<em>Lady trouble</em>?” </p><p>“It’s the only thing that gets him to leave,” Agatha muttered, taking the folder from Jen’s outstretched hand. “He probably thinks ‘lady trouble’ is when we dig for loose change in our vaginas.”</p><p>Jen cackled, clutching Agatha’s shoulder, but her amusement faded quickly. She hesitated, then gave her a long look.</p><p>“Are you okay?” she asked finally. “I know you’re going through stuff with Josh and everything, but you seem… something. I don’t know. <em> Off. </em>”</p><p>Agatha let out a sharp breath, flipping open the folder, glancing at the remarks inside without really seeing them. She snapped it shut.</p><p>“I’m fine, kid.” She forced a smile. </p><p>Jen didn't look convinced. “I’m in my late twenties. You can't call me that anymore. Also, you know Thelma and Louise die at the end, right?”</p><p>"Huh." Agatha stared. She'd forgotten. “Whatever. Admit it, J. You think Ralph is a boring, vengeful coward with terrible taste in blazers.”</p><p>Jen scoffed. “I am <em> way </em> too on the clock to answer that right now." Then she stepped into the wave of entering parents, and mouthed, <em> Ask me over drinks. </em></p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The old, battered microphone screeched the second Wanda touched it—another sound Agatha had come to associate with <em> School.</em> Of all things, she thought that should’ve been figured out by now. They’d gone from transparencies to smart boards, from computer labs to personal tablets, but the house mic still couldn’t turn on without contributing a violent noise of its own. Which, arguably, was the one thing a microphone was not supposed to do. </p><p>From the wings, Agatha watched as Wanda nodded pointedly in her direction. She hadn’t really been listening, but she he stepped onto the stage, mustering as much composure as she could. No matter how many times she did this, introducing herself always felt like a strange sort of confession, or an introduction at an A.A. meeting.</p><p>“Hello, everyone. I’m Agatha Harkness, and I teach second grade.”</p><p>The expected murmurs rippled through the crowd. She caught sight of Rio by the refreshment table in the back of the room. The PTA’s god-awful blueberry lemonade sat untouched next to a box of donuts, each one cut into sixteenths. Since when had <em> one-eighth </em> of a donut become too much to handle? Did no one realize how ridiculous they looked, cradling a communion wafer of Krispy Kreme and a cup of blue juice? Her stomach growled in betrayal, but she would never be hungry enough that she'd stand in line at the snack table to receive the body and the blood of the PTA. </p><p>Rio’s face was stony next to the colorful display. Agatha took in the sight of her, and just like that, their argument flared behind her eyes again. It spread hot through her body, like Rio had slipped a hand to the small of her back and struck a match against her spine. </p><p>
<em> Arrogant, asshole, know-it-all. </em>
</p><p>“You know,” Agatha said, the perfect opening presenting itself. “I’ve been really enjoying new types of <em> collaboration </em> in my classroom this year.” She flicked a dry glance at Ralph. “And I think collaboration is an important skill to demonstrate for our students.”</p><p>She gestured to Rio. “I have the pleasure of being a mentor this year, which means sharing knowledge I’ve learned in twenty years of teaching.” She paused, letting the weight of the utter bullshit saturate in the stale air.</p><p>“Earlier, I shared a quote with my colleague—one I think we can all learn from.” She turned her gaze to the rest of the audience, smiling. Then, deliberately, she repeated Rio’s words back to her. “‘I had some help in becoming who I am.’”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened. </p><p><em> Good, </em>Agatha thought. Let her feel like a deer in the headlights for one fucking minute and see how she liked it.</p><p>“Remind everyone here who said that,” Agatha said, her voice carrying easily through the room.</p><p>Heads turned, attention shifting in a slow, rolling wave. Rio blinked, her expression unreadable. The confident, eloquent Rio from the classroom was gone, and Agatha felt the curl of satisfaction in her gut. </p><p>“I…” Rio started, then stopped.</p><p>She shifted her weight, fingers tapping once against her elbow. A flicker of something crossed her face, but it passed too quickly to pin down.</p><p>“I forgot.”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow.</p><p>“Oh, come on. I’m sure you remember.” She turned back to the crowd, her voice cloying. “She’s like a steel trap, this one!”</p><p>Rio didn’t react right away. Then, slowly, she crossed her arms.</p><p>“Nope. Sorry.”</p><p>The crowd shifted again, their heads moving in time with the volley, interest sharpening. Rio’s voice was smooth, but there was something definitely off about it now. Agatha had meant to challenge her, and maybe hurt her back. But now, she didn't want to stop at backing her into a corner. She wanted to drive Rio to anger again, and make her say or do something she couldn't take back. She wanted Rio to sound <em>unfit</em> in front of all these people, and for someone else, anyone else, to know what it was like.</p><p>“Well, it's alright," Agatha said, the words tipping almost to a singsong. "You're still new, you have a lot to learn. Don't worry about it."</p><p>Rio looked up at her with a slow, measured tilt of the head.</p><p>“Actually,” she said. "I just remembered."</p><p>Her voice was steady, and her eyes held that familiar, dangerous gleam.</p><p>Agatha had just enough time to think, <em> Wait</em>— before Rio said loudly:</p><p>“Charles Manson.”</p><p>The room went silent. The words flew at Agatha like a baseball to the teeth. Her mouth flooded with the sharp taste of metal, and for a second, it felt like she was actually bleeding. There was a beat of silence, and then the microphone screeched again. </p><p>Charles. Manson. No <em> fucking </em> way.</p><p>The silence gave way to murmurs, fingers tapping furiously on screens. She realized she’d bitten the inside of her cheek, and the taste of blood in her mouth was real. Her eyes landed on the sharp set of Rio’s jaw, and she knew that she wasn’t joking. Agatha had just, with absolute sincerity, quoted Charles Manson to a room full of parents and the president of the school board.</p><p>Her eyes found Wanda’s huge ones. Wanda was already moving, her face pale, her hands reaching.</p><p>“Do you have a Charles Manson quote in your classroom?” someone in the crowd demanded. Agatha felt the microphone being yanked from her grip, Wanda’s fingers curling tight around it.</p><p>“No, I do not.” She kept her hands on the mic, even as Wanda pulled at it. “It was a joke! <em> Obviously! </em> She was kidding—<em>I</em> was kidding!”</p><p>Wanda tore the mic away, stepping in front of her. Agatha was left yelling into the room, her voice suddenly too small.</p><p>“I do not support Charles Manson, or his—his work.”</p><p>Screens lit up across the room with frantic searches Agatha could imagine with perfect clarity: ‘what did charles manson do,’ and ‘charles manson cult,’ and ‘agatha harkness oyster bend cult murderer.’</p><p>Her stomach twisted, heat rising in her face, and Wanda stepped forward. Her voice was smooth and practiced, and Agatha recognized the tone. It was the voice she used to clean up after someone’s graceless mess. Too often lately, that <em> someone </em> had been Agatha<em>. </em>She didn’t want this to feel familiar—Wanda stepping in front of her and doing damage control, like cramming squeezed-out toothpaste back into the tube, or ramming the pin back into a live grenade.</p><p>“What she meant was,” Wanda said, herding Agatha off to the side with a firm press of her palm. “You’ve all relied on someone to help you through obstacles and challenges. At Oyster Bend, that’s what our mission is—to be there for your young scholars when they need someone to lean on. No matter who you are.”</p><p>A murmur of agreement rippled through the room, and a few parents nodded, and Agatha didn’t hear the rest. She forced herself to glance toward the back of the room, hoping, at least, to find an ounce of guilt on Rio’s face. </p><p>Rio was eating three sixteenths of a donut. Agatha barely held herself onstage until the applause, and the second parents started standing, she made a beeline for the doors.</p><p><em> "Agatha," </em> a voice sing-songed, and suddenly, Kristy, PTA President and vindictive nightmare, was standing in front of her. Kristy had been on her case since last year, when Agatha informed her that her son had used a slur in class.</p><p>"Logan would <em> never,</em>"<em> </em>Kristy had snapped, launching into a tirade about how Agatha was lying—about something that had happened <em> right in front of her</em>—while poor Logan sat in the corner, biting the edge of his sleeve.</p><p>Logan and Agatha both knew he’d said it. He hadn’t even realized it was a hurtful word—kids usually didn’t. They just knew some words were meant for when you were angry. Maybe in his world, it was casually, unapologetically thrown around. But the moment Agatha explained it to him, he’d apologized to her, and to the other kid. </p><p>She’d summarized the situation in that parent-and-kid-friendly tone she could execute in her sleep, ending with, "We had a good chat, and he agreed not to use that word anymore." Logan had nodded seriously, returning Agatha’s thumbs-up. But Kristy had gone on for eleven full minutes before pausing just long enough to say:</p><p>"Well, wait. Which slur was it?"</p><p>Agatha had blinked. "Is that really important?”</p><p>"I just want to know if it’s the one I’m thinking of."</p><p>And there it was.</p><p>"If one immediately comes to mind," Agatha had said, "then it’s probably that one, isn’t it?"</p><p>That had earned her fourteen more minutes, an indisputable feud, and Kristy’s eternal hatred. Including, apparently, right fucking now.</p><p>“Please move," Agatha said, trying her hardest not to reach out and push her.</p><p>"That was classy," Kristy mused, sipping her blue juice. "Reminded me of your little <em> event </em> this summer.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath stilled. Her fingers curled into fists.</p><p>
<em> "Move." </em>
</p><p>Kristy stepped aside slowly. As Agatha sped past, she barely registered the flick of an arm before she felt it. Cold liquid hit her clavicle, and her breath caught in shock. Blueberry lemonade splattered across her chest, soaking into the fabric. She looked down at herself, vaguely reminded of the murder documentary she’d fallen asleep to last night. She felt like the victim in a staged reenactment—a dark blue stab wound blooming over the neckline of her dress.</p><p>"Oops." Kristy tilted her head, so deliberate in her timing that Agatha knew exactly how long she’d been imagining this moment. “What a shame. I’d throw that in the wash before the stain sets.”</p><p>The weight of the room pressed against Agatha’s skin—the eyes on her, the lemonade drying against her collarbone, the fury and humiliation hot on her neck. Kristy was still standing there, smiling. Agatha’s fingers twitched at her sides. She could take her. Kristy was tall and gangly; she’d topple right over. Just one good shove—</p><p>
<em> "Agatha?" </em>
</p><p>She whipped her head around, hands balled into fists, entirely ready for one more person to say her name tonight. Josh was standing there, flyer in hand like a straight-A student. He blinked at her dress, his mouth opening slightly like he'd considered saying something but thought better of it.</p><p>She stared at him. “Where’s Nicky?”</p><p>"I got off early and got a sitter," he said, still sounding confused. His gaze drifted past her.</p><p>Agatha wanted to shake him, even for that. She'd just humiliated herself in front of a crowd, <em> again</em>, she was covered in <em>juice</em>, and whatever was behind her was more interesting?</p><p>Her anger sharpened to a fine point. She opened her mouth, ready to lay into him in front of all of these parents, because <em>someone</em> deserved to get their ass handed to them tonight. And it was either going to be Josh, tail between his legs, or Kristy, picking her bloody veneers off the floor.</p><p>She turned to Josh, already halfway through the first syllable of whatever was about to rip him apart, until she realized that he was staring toward the back of the room. He was looking at <em>Rio</em>.</p><p>Rio, whom Agatha had definitely told him about—as in, <em> I have a new student teacher, Ms. V, so you might see someone new at pickup. </em>But definitely not: <em> Hey, so, Nicky’s other teacher is the stripper you paid to give me lap dance. </em></p><p>Maybe foolishly, she hadn’t worried about that particular thread unraveling. Josh, when drunk, was the perfect combination of unobservant and forgetful. He'd laid eyes on Rio for a grand total of five minutes, in the middle of a blackout. But now, Josh was looking at Rio. Really looking at her. And Rio—mouth slightly open, holding the last sixteenth of a chocolate donut in midair—was staring right back.</p><p>"Hey, I keep meaning to ask," Josh said. "The student teacher—she looks, like, super familiar.” His brow furrowed, gaze still locked on her. Agatha stopped breathing. </p><p>“Did she used to work at Olive Garden?"</p><p>She let out her breath, steadying herself on the chair next to her.</p><p>"Grocery store," she replied faintly. She moved deliberately toward Rio, pouring as much hatred as she could into a single look.</p><p>"Lucky fucking break," she gritted out. And then, she snatched the pathetic morsel of donut straight out of Rio’s hand, because apparently, she <em> was </em> that hungry. Rio bit back a smile.</p><p>Agatha stalked toward the exit, shaking out her hands at her sides. She shoved the donut piece into her mouth as she passed Kristy.</p><p>"Sixteen is too many fucking pieces,<em>" </em> she said with her mouth full. She didn’t stop when she reached the door, or when she heard Rio call her name, footsteps echoing behind her. Before she even realized where she was going, she was in the little room off the library.</p><p>She unlocked the supply closet door, shoved herself inside, and flipped on the light. The scent of sharpies and fresh printer paper hit her at once, and she sagged against a shelf of pink poster paper, her phone already buzzing. She swiped mechanically through the outrage in her inbox until a subject line caught her eye:</p><p>
<b>IS THIS THE WOMAN YOU WANT TEACHING YOUR CHILDREN?</b>
</p><p>She tapped the link against her better judgement, expecting to find her own juice-covered likeness. The video buffered, a grainy, pixelated freeze-frame of her face, mid-sentence. Instead of the harsh lighting of the auditorium, she registered the dull gray of the school board meeting chambers. Then, she recognized her own pale, drawn appearance. </p><p>She muted the video, but still, she watched. Shadows clung to her face on the screen, and she noticed the way she wavered slightly. Maybe she only saw it because she remembered how she hadn’t slept in days, or how Josh had moved out that same morning.</p><p>Her eyes stung as she watched herself on the screen. She was going to get fired because she couldn’t keep it together. Eventually, Rio’s secret would come out, and she’d be gone, too. Wanda was magic when it came to cleaning up messes, but she wasn’t God<em>. </em>And Josh—Josh was unobservant, not stupid. He’d put it together, sooner or later. How would she explain? <em> What </em> would she even be explaining? Would he keep Nicky away from her, and decide she was too unstable to be a mother? Would the whole town rally behind him?</p><p>The blue glow of her phone flickered in the dim closet. The walls pressed in. She heard three soft knocks.</p><p>“Let me in.”</p><p>Rio’s voice cut through the quiet, just above Agatha’s shallow breathing. She didn’t respond. The panic in her chest coiled tighter, sharpening into something hotter, something more manageable<em>. </em>This fucking woman. This was all <em> her </em> fault.</p><p>“I know you’re in there,” Rio said. “I can hear you having your little panic attack. It’s really not that bad, okay? Just let me in.”</p><p>Agatha’s fist closed around the first thing it could find. She hurled it at the door. A handful of colorful pom-poms bounced harmlessly off the wood, scattering across the linoleum. She glared at them, and kicked the nearest ones. </p><p>“Not to point out the irony of where you’re hiding,” Rio said through the door, “but I do know a thing or two about closets, if you—”</p><p>Agatha yanked the door open before she could finish. Rio just looked amused, the start of a smirk across her lips.</p><p>“Excuse me?” Agatha snapped, crossing her arms.</p><p>“Kidding,” Rio said lightly, and gestured behind her. “May I?” </p><p>Agatha didn’t move, glaring at her as she brushed past. Parent voices echoed down the hallway, and Agatha shut the door quickly. Rio glanced around at the supplies.</p><p>“I’ve only been in here once,” she said finally.</p><p>Agatha glared at the shelf of highlighters, willing them to walk themselves out of their boxes and right into Rio’s mouth, effectively shutting her up.</p><p>Rio continued, unbothered by Agatha’s death stare.</p><p>“Remember last week, when Lonzo’s mom said she was filing a complaint with the board because <em> Where the Wild Things Are </em> promotes ‘sinful behavior? Which is fucking <em> nuts</em>, by the way—if anything, she should be mad about the colonialist tropes, you know? Like, a white adventurer taming the wild.”</p><p>Agatha stared, her blood boiling, wondering why she had opened the door at all.</p><p>“Anyway,” Rio went on, “remember how you got so mad, you stapled a piece of paper, like, fifty times?”</p><p>She looked around again, assessing the stock. “This is where I came to get more staples.”</p><p>Agatha took a step forward, her patience finally snapping.</p><p>“Can you stop acting like this is all so fucking hilarious?”</p><p>Rio just raised an eyebrow. Agatha kept going, advancing on Rio in the small space.</p><p>“First of all, you and Lonzo’s mom are the only two people on the <em> planet </em> who don’t like that book, which is just my luck. Second of all—and much more importantly—you have no idea what you just did to me in there. <em> Charles Manson</em>? Are you fucking kidding? You crucified me, Rio.”</p><p>Rio crossed her arms, mirroring Agatha.</p><p>“What <em> I </em> did?” Her voice had a definitive edge now. “I was obviously being sarcastic when I said that quote. And by the way, you reprimanded me for not communicating with you, then <em> ten minutes later</em>, you lied to an entire room to make yourself look good. Just because you were mad at me.”</p><p>She took a step closer. “And then I actually tried to give you an out, and <em> you </em> chose not to take it.”</p><p>Agatha’s felt her words land. Her chest rose and fell, the weight closing in on her in this stupid, suffocating closet. Rio watched her carefully, eyes flicking over her stiff posture, and then to the phone at her side.</p><p>Her gaze sharpened.</p><p>“What is that?”</p><p>“Nothing.” She clicked it off.</p><p>“Is this why you’re freaking out? Let me see.”</p><p>Rio reached for the phone.</p><p>Agatha yanked it back, twisting away.</p><p>“Stop—”</p><p>Rio was already lunging for it, faster than Agatha expected. Rio caught her wrist, then the phone, fingers latching onto the case. Agatha stumbled against the shelf behind her. Her spine bit into the wood, a box of ballpoint pens toppling over her shoulder as she tried to wrench her arm away. But Rio was stronger, forcing Agatha’s hand back against the shelf.</p><p>“Let go,” Rio said, pulling.</p><p>The phone slipped from Agatha’s fingers for a fraction of a second, and then she put her weight into it, and Rio lost her footing. She let out a startled noise as she staggered, and Agatha took the opening. For a second, they were a tangled mess of scrabbling hands and shifting weight, and Agatha could hear Rio’s muffled, breathless laughter.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t laughing in the slightest. She swiped for the phone, missed, and her fingers tangled in Rio’s hair. Rio hissed through her teeth, her head jerking to the side. She twisted Agatha’s wrist in retaliation, and in response, Agatha dug her nails into Rio’s forearm.</p><p>“Jesus,” Rio breathed, wincing, pulling her arm and her hair free. “You’re not trying to ‘Charles Manson’ me, are you?”</p><p>Agatha all but growled at her then, pushing her back into the shelf, the weight of her body pinning Rio in place. A container of paperclips tipped over above them, emptying over their heads. Frozen in blind rage, with metal raining around them, she felt Rio's breath hitch. Suddenly, Agatha noticed the way Rio's throat pushed against her collar with every inhale. </p><p>Agatha found her eyes. They were dark, almost curious, and her gaze flickered to Agatha’s mouth. Agatha blinked. Rio was looking at her mouth. That same strange, feeling from the club crept up her spine—every sensation heightened,<em> </em>everything <em>too much</em>. Agatha wasn’t drunk at a strip club, and yet, here was Rio, at her place of work, being paid to pay attention to Agatha. Now, it was neon pink poster paper glowing above her heads instead of a naked woman’s flickering silhouette. This was decidedly more terrifying.</p><p>She looked at Rio's mouth, and heat curled at the base of her neck, her fingertips starting to tighten around Rio’s arms.</p><p>Agatha took an automatic step back.</p><p>For a moment, neither of them moved. Then Rio relaxed, dislodging herself from the shelf. Agatha took in the sight of her crooked blazer, her fingers removing a paper clip from her disheveled hair. She looked at Agatha, still.</p><p>Slowly, she held out her other hand, and opened her fingers, offering the phone back. Agatha reached for it carefully, like Rio might make a sudden movement, but she didn’t. </p><p>“Let me see,” Rio said again. But her voice was softer this time. She was asking.</p><p>Agatha bit the inside of her cheek. She felt the sticky fabric of her dress against her chest, the droplets of blueberry lemonade in the tips of her hair, flattening her curls that she hadn’t cared about anyway, but that maybe, she'd cared about a little.</p><p>Her thumb hovered over the screen, and her eyes flitted to Rio’s. She placed it slowly back into her palm. She turned around then, planting her eyes on the wall. She stared at the mess on the floor, at a single red pom-pom, smushed on one side.</p><p>And then, she heard Ralph’s voice.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“I say we move to approve the new mural for this coming school year, commissioned by a former student.” </p><p>The shaky audio filled the supply closet: the feedback from the cheap microphone, the rustling of papers, someone coughing faintly.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Agatha, did you have a concern to voice? I see that you’re shaking your head.” </p><p>Then, the warped, strange sound of her own voice. </p><p>“Do I have a <em> concern, </em>Ralph? Yeah, I have a <em> concern</em>.”</p><p>The scrape of a chair across the floor. Her voice was somehow still too sharp, even through her waterlogged speakers. </p><p>“My <em> concern </em>was voiced fifteen years ago, actually, when you and the old board and a hairbrained PTA decided that Oyster Bend’s mascot was a river otter, even though river otters have nothing to do with oysters. Believe it or not, sea otters still don’t live in Massachusetts, and sea otters and river otters are still not the same animal. But fine, let’s throw it on a mural to commemorate the utter lack of attention to detail that goes into running this school district.”</p><p>“Okay, let’s just take a second to calm-–”</p><p>“No. You asked me if I had a concern, Ralph, so you’re going to listen to my fucking concern.”</p><p>Agatha heard the beat of stunned silence. Then, she kept going.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“You people make it impossible to be a teacher.</p><p>And being a mom <em> and </em> a teacher? I have to teach your kids to have some fucking perspective. And then I have to go home to my own kid, and figure out how to explain it all. </p><p>There will never be enough hours in the school day for me to undo what you’re doing to your kids. I'm trying, but I go back to school, and go back home, and realize that I’ll just be doing that for the rest of my life until I fucking die, because I’ll probably still be in that classroom when I take my last breath.</p><p>You know how when you’re younger, you can’t imagine that anything will ever feel like the end? And you think you’re so smart—that you’re making these little deals with yourself. One year, they want to add a couple kids to your class. You think—<em>sure, what’s a couple more? </em>I'll pull in some extra desks. The next year, they want to make your lunch five minutes shorter. You think—<em>no big deal, I can leave five minutes earlier. </em>It’s a fair exchange, like in a stupid board game, right? It’s what we teach the kids: <em> ‘Monopoly </em> only works if everyone agrees to play by the same rules.’ </p><p>So you tell yourself—it’s fine. It’s just one more thing<em>. </em>But then, all of a sudden, you realize you’ve been passing ‘Go’ for twenty fucking years. And now, you’re required to respond to every parent email, even if it takes all night. Even the ones from Kristy, asking if her son can re-do his worksheet because he only wrote two sentences. He’s <em> seven</em>, Kristy. Two full sentences is a miracle. I asked him where he wants to go on vacation<em>,</em> not for a personal statement. And by the way—he said he wants to go to his ‘friend Riley’s house<em>,’ </em> so you’re wasting your fucking money on those trips to San Tropez.</p><p>So yes, Ralph, I <em> am concerned</em>. Because you and the PTA—the sweaty back acne of the public school system—are asking me to be here even though I just spent all morning helping my husband move his boxes out of our fucking house. To ask for my opinion on fifth grade biology, which you will ignore, again.</p><p>And yes, I came anyway, because that’s what teachers do.</p><p>I consider it <em> concerning </em>that one day, you just wake up, and it’s been twenty years since you started this job. You look in the mirror, and it feels like you’re wearing one of those scary fucking Halloween masks that look like real people. And it’s like—of <em> course </em> you know it has to be you, but how can <em> that face </em> possibly be yours?</p><p>But maybe, as it turns out, that’s just another fair exchange.</p><p>And the worst part, Ralph, is that there’s always a little part of you that knows that it wasn’t always like this. You <em> know </em> that when you got here, you had such big, <em> beautiful </em> things. A brand new house, grad school accolades, a promising career. A love so big and easy you were absolutely sure was the love of your life. But for twenty years, you made so many little deals with yourself, gave away so many little green houses, that now—you can’t even remember what you started with.</p><p>And you’re standing there in front of these incredible kids, telling them it’s so wonderful to grow and change, when it’s all a fucking lie. Because growing and changing means getting ripped apart by people like all of you, who have no idea what it’s like to love something so much, you will give yourself away to keep it.</p><p>This summer, <em> today</em>, it’s my husband and a fucked-up mural.</p><p>Tomorrow, and the day after, it’ll be something else.</p><p>Just one more <em> fucking </em> thing.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Agatha heard the click of her phone, and still, Rio said nothing.</p><p>The closet was too bright, the overhead light drilling into her skull. Her mouth opened before she could stop it.</p><p>“Kristy tried to stop me from getting in my car after that.” </p><p>A pause—then, Rio’s voice, quiet. “Sounds like Kristy has a death wish. What'd you do?”</p><p>Agatha rubbed a hand over the bridge of her nose. “I ‘spilled’ my coffee into her vintage Coach purse.”</p><p>There was a soft snort from behind her, and Agatha turned, finally, still looking at the floor.</p><p>“That would explain the…” Rio gestured to the stain on Agatha’s chest, and she tilted her head in acknowledgement. </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said after a beat, and there was something soft in her voice. Agatha looked up, and Rio was looking at her with something like understanding where Agatha had expected to find pity. And there was something else, too, pooling deep and warm in her eyes. The word <em>affection</em> came to mind, although that didn’t make sense.</p><p>Rio put the phone on the shelf beside her, eyes still on Agatha, and reached for the lapels of her own blazer. She slid it off her shoulders and draped it over a stack of chairs. For one, ridiculous second, Agatha wondered if Rio was disrobing for a fight.</p><p>Then, Rio lifted her hands to the top button of her collared shirt.</p><p>“What are you…” Agatha’s voice failed her, eyes glued to Rio’s hands moving deliberately down the line of buttons.</p><p>Rio didn’t answer, shrugging off her shirt, revealing a fitted black tank. She took a step closer, and Agatha swallowed the fluorescent shine against her collarbone.</p><p>“Turn around,” Rio said quietly. </p><p>Agatha stared at her, frozen. She wanted to ask what the fuck Rio was doing. But her mouth stayed shut, her pulse hammering in her throat. And then she turned, slowly. She felt a light tug on her hair, then Rio’s hands. She was twisting, Agatha realized, securing it into a bun at the nape of her neck, hiding the damp, flattened ends. </p><p>“I’ve been a dancer since I could walk,” Rio said quietly, her hands still working. “All kinds, anything you could name. I know how to handle a wardrobe emergency.”</p><p>Agatha felt Rio’s fingertips dance over the back of her neck, and she shivered, the dress giving as the zipper slid down. Rio peeled the wet fabric down her torso, pausing at her waist, and Agatha pulled her hands from the sleeves as if she were sleepwalking. She felt the words rising against her tongue, quick and defensive, to protect herself from Rio’s gaze on her skin, but before she could force them out, she felt something cover her shoulders. Rio’s shirt. Agatha breathed, and pulled her arms through, her fingers fumbling over the buttons. </p><p>Rio pulled at the long sleeves of her dress, now dangling at her waist, and cinched them behind Agatha’s back. She could feel Rio’s hands at her sides, pressing the shirt into place under the makeshift hem, and it should have felt odd, being dressed like a child that had spilled juice on herself at a party, but it didn’t feel like that at all. Agatha tried to steady her breathing, Rio’s hands warm as they circled around her from behind, dipping the shirt into the waistband at her stomach. Rio draped the blazer over her last.</p><p>Agatha could feel Rio’s breath against her neck, and when she spoke, Agatha could feel the words curl into her ear.</p><p>“‘He’s just a boy, pretending to be a wolf, pretending to be a king.' I never said I didn’t like Wild Things.”</p><p>Agatha felt Rio brush past her, catching a glimpse of her bare arms as she slipped out of the closet, looking somehow still poised and professional in a tank top and slacks. The door clicked shut behind her.</p><p>Agatha curled her fist in the bucket of pom-poms again, her knuckles white. She exhaled, unsteady, and finally looked down at herself. The cuffs of Rio’s white shirt brushed her wrists. The scent still clung to the fabric, warmth and spiced cologne, cinnamon and vanilla. It felt like fall, and the maple leaves that fell over her picnic table, and the first day of school. </p><p>She took a deep breath and looked down at the gaudy mess: pom-poms, pens, colored paper. She brushed her hands against her hair and felt the bun Rio had twisted for her. Her fingers snagged against a paper clip by her ear—her tiny, crooked crown. She pulled the blazer tighter around her shoulders, and standing under the fluorescent lights of her kingdom, she let herself cry, a graveyard of wild things at her feet.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

</p><p> </p><p>For once, the teachers’ lounge was full, the last of the volunteers crammed almost shoulder to shoulder in the tiny space. The room was starting to feel hot, the October afternoon sun streaming through the windows. Agatha gathered her hair off of her neck and fanned herself with her clipboard. Twenty years, and the temperature control in this school was still presumably operated by the devil himself. </p><p>She looked at her phone again. Today marked the third time Rio had been late in the last week, which she was keeping track of because it was her job, and not for any other reason.</p><p>A thin, orange fiber clung to the side of her screen. Last night, she and Nicky had sat at the kitchen table, their heads bowed toward each other over two enormous pumpkins. Nicky’s sounds of delight were still fresh in her mind, his squeals at the feel of the cold, slimy seeds and guts slipping through his fingers onto newspaper. She even giggled a couple times herself, hands squelching into the pulp. Her own laughter lingered, too, like it might slip out again this morning if she weren’t careful.</p><p>She'd let herself enjoy it, long after she put Nicky to bed—the sound of the steady scrape, the feel of the knife moving through the flesh and fiber. One hand on the handle, the other caressing the cool skin, holding it steady. She carved out a terrible, dangerous smile, wild eyes and sharp teeth. And still, she sat, plucking seeds out of the innards one by one. Her fingers wove steadily into the night, caught up in the rare ease of repetition.</p><p>Now, the room was hot and loud, and the dried pumpkin caught under her thumb. She picked at it, her nail tapping against the screen. Still no word from Rio. Agatha looked at the array of teachers and parents perched on the worn furniture, exchanging small talk at various levels of exhaustion. Jen leaned against the armrest of the green sofa, next to a poorly strung paper ghost. </p><p>Teachers spent too much time transforming every other inch of the school, including the bathrooms, paper bats and pumpkins stuck to the mirrors. By the time the spiderweb bags ran empty and their exhausted feet made it down the hallway, all they wanted to do was collapse into the green couch. The only evidence of Halloween in the teachers' lounge was one crooked paper ghost and empty packaging in the trash can. </p><p>Her phone buzzed, and she felt the familiar crest and fall. Not only had Rio still not arrived, but she'd now received three messages from her accountant. For the past month, she’d been trapped in the world’s worst game of telephone between her accountant and her divorce lawyer, and she'd taken to compulsively ignoring them both in favor of even the most undesirable tasks. Keeping with the tradition, she turned her phone face down on the desk and cleared her throat.</p><p>"Happy Friday, everyone."</p><p>The room quieted instantly. It wasn’t really the volume that did it; it was just that teacher <em> thing </em> where she could reach a hand into the air and twist the energy in a room. She’d always enjoyed having that particular skill, even if her recent execution had been shaky at best.</p><p>"Thank you for giving us your Friday afternoon," she started, scanning the faces in front of her. A few teachers lingered by the doorway—teachers who, notably, had never stuck around for event prep. Kristy tended to the sparkling water and homemade rice krispie squares, this time cut to a reasonable size. Since last month, she'd taken to watching Agatha like if she even closed her eyes for a second, Agatha might suddenly strip naked and climb the flagpole. </p><p>Agatha was still plagued by choppy, nightmarish flashes of Back to School Night at the most inconvenient times, most often when she pulled into the parking lot. But one image had stayed oddly clear: the slow ripple of nods through the crowd, right before Rio revealed the source of the quote. Agatha had issued an apology, her shoulders stiff and face burning as she wrote. Wanda had peered over her shoulder and assured her that it would all blow over. Agatha had brushed it off as well-meaning best-friend-type bullshit, but miraculously, the leaves turned brown over the grass, and the engine of outrage sputtered back to a crawl.</p><p>At first, Agatha figured they felt sorry for her, dripping in lemonade and emerging from a supply closet in a new outfit. But late one night, mid-shower and mid-reach for the conditioner, something more plausible had struck: <em> they </em> hadn’t recognized the quote either. They didn't want to admit they’d missed something as glaring as the accolades of an infamous cult leader. She'd played the fool publicly, but the spectators in their plastic seats knew that the only thing more humiliating than playing a fool was believing in one.</p><p>By late October, she felt the difference in the hallways: soft smiles, nods on the playground, quick waves in the parking lot. Teachers who'd once kept their distance now looked at her like they wanted to say something. A fifth-grade teacher, Peggy, had clapped her on the back just yesterday and muttered, "That board meeting video? Well said." As Peggy left her the last half-muffin in the pastry box, Agatha let herself believe that maybe, <em> possibly</em>, things were not as catastrophic as she’d originally thought.</p><p>"We are twenty-four hours away from Halloween Harvest!" Agatha announced, and the small room echoed with weak, smattered applause. Jen whooped from her place on the sofa, and Agatha glanced at her phone again. Logic dictated that she should delegate the haunted house—the <em> one </em> thing she had reluctantly placed into Rio’s hands after making her swear to take it seriously. </p><p>She looked back at the ordered chaos on her clipboard, the twice-rewritten lists and notes-to-self in the margins. She knew every inch of this event inside and out. The guts were cleaned and disposed, seeds separated. </p><p>"New volunteers. I still need costume contest judges, a cotton candy operator, a playlist for the haunted house, and a teacher on electrical. Sign up if you can help. After that, check the list outside for what we still need to finish. Find me if you need anything."</p><p>She left the clipboard on the table as parents lined up, and heard a quiet "Hey." She turned to her left, and Alice, the PE teacher, was leaning against the wall next to her.</p><p>Agatha paused. "Hey." </p><p>Alice had been the PE teacher for three years, but this was definitely the first time she'd ever spoken to Agatha. Her hair was streaked with orange, and Agatha briefly wondered if it had always been that way, and she'd never noticed until now.</p><p>"I can do electrical," Alice said.</p><p>"Oh. Great." Agatha tried not to sound surprised. "You know where the ladders are, and the utility closet with the panel? And all the outlets?"</p><p>"Yup," Alice said, still leaning against the wall. "Also, last month? That was crazy—tough break."</p><p>Agatha braced for the punchline, but Alice said it offhand. "That video? Where you made that kid’s mural, like, super political? Solid."</p><p>Agatha let out a laugh, and studied Alice. "<em>Why </em> did you like it?"</p><p>"It was dark," Alice said. "Most teachers I know are a little dark. Rio said you guys were just messing around at back to school night, too, so I’m sure you’re sick of hearing about all of it. Just wanted to say, I’m a fan."</p><p>Agatha blinked. <em> Of course.  </em></p><p>In the days following the event, which Wanda had categorized "A.M.," for "After Manson," Rio had been strangely subdued. She'd even bought Agatha a new purple coffee mug with a working lid as a peace offering. At first, Rio’s sheepishness had been satisfying, because Agatha really had been furious. Furious enough to open Rio's mid-semester evaluation one night, drunk off of too many margaritas after one particularly scathing local article. She sat on the floor of her living room, leaning against the couch, and let her fingers type freely with unfiltered rage. Then Wanda had texted her and snapped her out of her tequila-fueled fury. So she'd shoved the laptop under her bed, and saved the task for a more lucid day.</p><p>Now, Rio was forming alliances for Agatha behind her back, and Agatha wasn’t sure whether to feel irritated or grateful. Maybe she would have a better idea if Rio were actually <em> here</em>.</p><p>"Right," she said to Alice, unsure how else to respond. "Thanks. For the electrical."</p><p>Alice nodded and pushed off the wall, her keys swinging in her hand.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Agatha's phone rang as soon as she stepped outside.</p><p>"Where are you?" she snapped, and silence rang out on the other end.</p><p>"I’m… in my office," a voice said. A <em> man’s </em>voice. Agatha looked at the screen.</p><p>"Fuck me." She mouthed it emphatically in place of shouting, but it didn't feel quite the same. She put her phone back to her ear.</p><p>"I wasn’t talking to you. I’m busy, Paul. What do you want?" She made her way toward the auditorium, and felt the breeze sting against her cheeks. She made a mental note to tell someone to tie down the scarecrows so they didn't have another situation like last year.</p><p>"I was just calling to check in," Paul said.</p><p>"Please. You only call when you need something."</p><p>"Ouch, not true."</p><p>Agatha could hear the creak of his office chair that meant he was leaning back. "Not even three weeks ago, I called to tell you that one of our old classmates got arrested for child porn. Which, by the way, was a huge blow to my PhD's credibility."</p><p>Agatha stopped walking in the middle of the basketball court, pressing a hand to her forehead before curling it into a fist.</p><p>"Paul." She took a slow, deep breath. "<em>What</em> <em>do you want</em>?" </p><p>"I really am calling to check in. It seems like you’ve been getting your fair share of bullshit recently, which is a little more on brand for me, not so much you."</p><p>Agatha blinked, still standing in the middle of the blacktop. </p><p>"I also wanted to give you a heads up," Paul continued. "Ralph is planning on dropping by tomorrow, and invited a local journalist to come with. I don’t think it’s personal. Just, you know, optics. Or maybe it’s a little personal. Either way, keep in mind that if you go apeshit on him again, it’ll be on the record."</p><p>"Jesus, I’ll be <em>fine.</em>" She shifted her weight, racking her brain for ulterior motives, then, finding none, asked point blank: "Why are you telling me this?"</p><p>"Because I’m a nice guy," Paul said, and Agatha rolled her eyes. </p><p>"And because Ralph has been on my ass, and it’s getting annoying. Just promise you’ll act surprised. Maybe even a little shell-shocked."</p><p>Agatha paused again. Of all the times Paul had rolled out the '<em>Trust me, I’m on your side' </em> schtick, this might have been the first time in twenty years that she actually believed him. She rolled her neck to one side before tilting it back. The sky was a dizzying, cloudless blue, all wrong for this time of year. She took a deep breath, the phone warm against her ear, and squeezed her eyes shut in hasty prayer.</p><p>
<em> God damn Paul and his motherfucking goddamn phone calls, and please let this not be a trap, and please Jesus let Ralph and his god damn fucking tweed blazers get lost on the way to this event. Amen. </em>
</p><p>She opened her eyes and kicked a pebble by her foot, watching it tumble into a clump of weeds. Her big toe stung through her sneakers. </p><p>"Fine," she said finally. "Thanks for the heads up."</p><p>"No problem. And you should answer your phone a little more politely."</p><p>"Fuck you."</p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was still thinking about the phone call as she ducked under a curtain of loose, black plastic, flapping in the entrance of the auditorium. Ralph bringing a journalist didn’t bother her—Halloween was the one day a year she knew she was unflappable. But Paul giving her a heads-up was uncharacteristic, at least in the last decade. Calling her twice in one month just to <em>check in</em> was certainly more unsettling than any journalist.</p><p>Agatha frowned, shaking off the thought. The decorations were partly underway—a pile of fake bones in the corner, cardboard headstones stacked and waiting against the wall. She stepped over an extension cord and adjusted a skeleton, two fingers under its chin. She scanned the wooden frames, searching for safety hazards or poor artistic choices, but curiously, she found none.</p><p>Volunteers were stringing up black trash bags as makeshift walls that shifted in the cross-breeze. For once, no one needed her direction. Agatha watched, fiddling uselessly with an orange streamer. For a second, she basked in the thrill of watching something she'd created come to life, like it had every year for almost two decades.</p><p>Sunlight spilled through the back doors, and a flicker of yellow caught her eye. She followed it, stepping into the cool autumn air. The back lot stretched in front of her, the sounds of parent chatter fading as she took in the beginnings of a pumpkin patch. She closed her eyes and inhaled the distinctly comforting combination of glue, hay, and paint.</p><p>Her eyes landed on a red folding chair pushed against the wall. Some kid's abandoned ice pack sat on the seat, left to melt, condensation dripping down the sides of the plastic bag. </p><p>Beyond the chair, a whiteboard leaned against the building, covered in a familiar, uneven scrawl. Rio might as well have written her name. Agatha moved forward, drawn to the shape of the words, and her thumb swiped absently at a smudge in the margin. The board was covered in tasks. Agatha’s list had been comprehensive, but this list was different. This one had changes, and additional notes, and initials by each item. This one was <em> color-coded</em>. </p><p>She was halfway through scrutinizing the line items when she heard a muffled grunt, followed by the hollow slap of hands on cardboard. Rio appeared suddenly around the corner, approaching a pile of unopened boxes in the back of someone’s pickup. She was carrying the largest one, and shifted it to one side, yanking off the marker cap with her teeth.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, the sound too loud in the quiet lot. Rio turned her head, the cap sticking out of her mouth. "Hey," she said around the plastic. Her tongue flicked absently against it.</p><p>Agatha forgot her opening line, her eyes catching on the mindless motion, the gentle bite of Rio's teeth and the light press of her tongue. Rio set the box down at her feet, and capped the pen.</p><p>"Sorry I’m late. Anything specific you need?"</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms, walking closer. She eyed the boxes unnecessarily. "I need you to be on time."</p><p>"Yeah, I know. Won’t happen again."</p><p>The afternoon light was harsh over her features, hitting her brow, turning her eyes to dark hollows as she continued her inventory. Agatha studied her tousled hair and rumpled sweatshirt. </p><p>"That’s it?" Agatha said. "No excuses? No lecture about how time is a social construct?"</p><p>"Nope," Rio said simply, lowering herself to the ground. She swayed, her eyes widening, and Agatha’s hands shot out to steady her. Rio blew out a slow breath as she settled stiffly on the pavement. Rio glanced at Agatha’s nails still pressing into her bicep.</p><p>Agatha straightened quickly and took a casual step back. And then another.</p><p>"What’s wrong with you?" she asked finally, noticing the way Rio’s leg stretched out to the side. </p><p>Rio surveyed the contents of the box, rifling through tangled LED strips and remnants of masking tape. She pulled one strip out, and the entire pile came with it, clinging tightly together. She dropped it and rubbed a hand over her face.</p><p>"I pulled a muscle," she said finally. "Jogging."</p><p>"You jog?" Agatha said dryly, fidgeting with the corner of the cardboard lid.</p><p>"You don’t think I can run?"</p><p>It had all the words and cadence of Rio's deadpan jokes, but it fell too cold and flat.</p><p>"I think you’re more of an American Ninja Warrior type," Agatha said, watching her carefully.</p><p>Rio smiled a little at that, and Agatha felt a surprisingly strong wave of relief. She watched Rio work for a minute, separating out the loops of tape from the lights, setting them aside one by one, her fingers plucking and pulling. It reminded her of sitting at her kitchen table, picking out the seeds from the guts, one by one. She had the strange, certain feeling that she could stand here for another hour, and Rio would keep working in steady silence.</p><p>Agatha wanted to know what happened with a ferocity that side-swept her. The longer she stood there watching, the more her fingers twitched. She wanted to tear the lights from Rio's hands, grip her by the shoulders, and make her say <em> something</em>. But there she sat, working silently, and Agatha didn’t know how to push her when she was already sprawled out on the ground.</p><p>She'd never been able to stand this particular feeling—the guessing and the missing. When she was nine, her twelve year-old neighbor, Val, had taught her how to spit off the roof of their apartment building. "You have to guess where it’s going to land," she'd said, "and really go for it."</p><p>They'd take turns until Agatha’s stomach hurt from laughing and the street lights turned off. Val’s mother would poke her head out of the roof door, and say, "Come on, Valkyrie, time for dinner." And "Agatha, I’m sure your mother wants you back inside, too." And Agatha would say, "Yes, I heard her calling me," and Val and Val’s mother and Agatha would all three know she was lying. They'd let her walk downstairs with them anyway.</p><p>Val had a seemingly magical ability to know where her spit was going to land—on that car, on the sidewalk across the street, on the man’s bald head as he walked by. Agatha could barely even see it hit the ground. She chalked it up to the superior age and wisdom of <em> twelve</em>, and just yelled and cheered whenever Val did, her chest ballooning with pride when it seemed like she'd gotten one right.</p><p>After Val moved away, Agatha kept going to the roof, but she could never call it right again. She tried every night, until the night before her mother moved them out of that apartment and into a smaller, older one with water-damaged walls and bars on the windows. Finally twelve years old, she'd given herself one last chance. She picked a spot, planted her feet in the gravel and given it her all, but she'd still lost it in the air.</p><p>She spent her last night in that apartment crying, face hot with failure and disappointment. At twelve years old, standing on a roof, Agatha decided that there must be something wrong with her that she couldn’t get it right.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Rio sat on the ground, silent and impossible, and Agatha might as well have been back on the roof, spitting fervently into the wind. The same frustration rubbed at her skin, the need to know how it would land, and the gnawing fear that she never would. That this woman in front of her would be the one thing she would never be able to understand.</p><p>Instead of trying, she turned to the chair by the auditorium door, eyeing the plastic bag full of water. She pulled her radio from her waistband, and clicked it on to the familiar hum of static.</p><p>"Happy."</p><p>"This is Happy; copy."</p><p>"Hey, it’s Agatha. Can you run me an ice pack to the back of the auditorium?"</p><p>"Copy. Coming right up."</p><p>She swung the bag of water into the trash can, and when she looked back at Rio, her hands had stilled.</p><p>"It melted," Agatha said, and she saw something soften slightly in Rio’s expression. Her fingers started up again, buried in the tangled pile. Pluck, separate, pull. </p><p>"I hurt myself… <em> bartending</em>," she said carefully. "Last night."</p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>Agatha spotted Happy zooming toward them in a golf cart in the distance, wavering with the speed of his turns. Rio followed her gaze.</p><p>"It was nothing. I was late because I was icing it in my car, and I fell asleep. Sorry." </p><p>Agatha was hit with the image of Rio passed out in her car, ice melting in the plastic bag against her leg. Her chest tightened, frustration dissipating in the face of Rio’s plain exhaustion. The question still lingered in her mouth, but Rio had already turned back to the lights, fingers working through the mess.</p><p>"It’s fine," Agatha mumbled, as Happy pulled up next to them. He dismounted from the cart with the biggest bag of ice Agatha had ever seen, and she blinked.</p><p>"Happy, I asked for an ice pack."</p><p>"Yeah, here you go, ma’am."</p><p>"This is enough ice for a frat party. I need an <em> ice pack</em>, like, for an injury."</p><p>"You injured?" Happy said, inspecting her. "Let’s go, we're going to the nurse. Hop on."</p><p>"No," Agatha said, setting the bag down next to Rio. "It’s for her, and she’s fine."</p><p>Agatha turned to Rio, who was smiling. "You are fine, right?" she added.</p><p>"Yeah. I’m good. Hey, Happy. Thanks for the ice."</p><p>"Hey, Ms. V. Anytime, okay?"</p><p>Agatha held a hand to her head as he drove away, and the two of them stared at the party bag of ice on the ground. Finally, Rio laughed, the half-untangled mess of lights falling back into the box, and Agatha broke, too, the tension melting from her shoulders at the sight of Rio at ease.</p><p>"Excuse me," she heard, and found a parent standing behind her. "Which ghost should we put at the entrance? The animatronic one or the hanging one?"</p><p>"Hanging," Rio and Agatha answered at the same time, and the parent looked between them, their faces still flushed from laughter. Agatha opened her mouth, and then closed it, gesturing to Rio.</p><p>"It’ll be easier to block the view of what’s past the entrance," Rio explained.</p><p>The parent nodded, and left Agatha looking at Rio, suitably impressed. </p><p>"Okay," Agatha said after a beat. "You’ve obviously got things covered. I'll leave you to it."</p><p>She turned toward the pumpkin patch, and then hesitated. She turned back, and Rio looked at her, standing there uncertainly, six paces away and rocking on her heels.</p><p>"Also…" Agatha paused, shifting her weight. The breeze tugged at the edge of her collar. There it was: the wind-up, feet rooted in the gravel, wind on her face.</p><p>"It's never looked this good by Friday afternoon. I usually have to tear down a bunch of stuff and make them start over. And the parents actually seem to know what they’re working on, for once. So whatever you’re doing, just…keep doing it."</p><p>The look of surprise on Rio’s face was almost comical, and Agatha almost rolled her eyes and took it all back. But then, Rio smiled at her—a real smile, spreading slow across her lips. Agatha’s pulse somersaulted in her throat before she turned decisively towards the pumpkins.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>When her mother died, thirteen Octobers ago, she decided to go back to that childhood apartment. She went straight to the roof. She looked down, remembering the evenings she'd spent in competition with Val, and then, even longer, with herself. And standing there at twenty-nine years old in the afternoon sun, she wound back, and spit with her full, grown-up might. With her expensive, high-powered contact lenses, and wisdom of age and fresh tenure, she still didn’t see it hit the ground. </p><p>For the first time, she'd thought to consider Val a child, instead of a sage, and suddenly understood that Val had never been able to see it, either. She'd been making it up the whole time, and Agatha had celebrated all the same. </p><p> </p><hr/><p><br/><br/>Agatha sat heavily on Nicky’s bed, bouncing once before flopping over.</p><p>"Mama, you can’t sleep!" he giggled, pulling her by the arm. "We have to go!"</p><p>"But I’m sleepy," she mumbled into his pillow. She breathed in, snuggling into the blanket, and it smelled like him. The toll of teaching and event-planning weighed her down in the small bed. Maybe she could just close her eyes for a second. </p><p>"Mama." He was using his serious voice now, and Agatha peeled her eyes open, fighting the urge to laugh. He was looking at her, arms crossed. No question where he got <em> that </em> look.</p><p>"Okay, I’m up." She leaned on her elbows, and nodded towards the mirror. "Did you check it out? How’d I do?"</p><p>Nicky walked back to the glass, his gaze falling over his black and white striped dress, and he touched the two braids over his shoulders. His face was painted white, his eyelids dark. He made his best scary face at himself in the mirror, lost in the carefree self-admiration of seven. He leaned in and stuck out his tongue, making a wet mark on the glass.</p><p>"Don’t touch your face for a few minutes, okay?"</p><p>Agatha pulled her bare feet out of the blanket and watched him, unable to stop. He was swaying side to side to see how the dress swished around his high socks. She smiled, and finally, reluctantly, turned to the more difficult task at hand.</p><p>When Nicky had assigned her the role, she hadn’t told him this would be her third time dressing up as Morticia. Granted, the first two times were in her twenties. The only remnants of her twenties in her closet were an Oyster Bend t-shirt, her wedding dress, and Morticia Addams black velvet. She felt a strange mix of deep excitement and existential dread as she pulled the velvet dress up by the sides. It was a little bit of a constructed nightmare, forcing her hips and sides into an outfit from twenty years ago, the dress just as snug and unforgiving, the body and face underneath warped and changed.</p><p>The ankle-length velvet swept around her as she moved, her sturdy, platform boots adding three inches that felt like a foot. She shifted her weight, making sure she could still pivot and step easily so she wouldn't trip and fall on her face in front of Ralph and his pet journalist.</p><p>The neckline swept under her collarbone in a wide scoop, and her sleeves widened at the wrist. She'd straightened her hair, and it fell smoothly behind her shoulders. Once she'd finished her makeup—dark lipstick, eyeshadow, and white powder dusting her face and chest—she stared at her reflection in surprise. This was the most effort she'd put into an outfit all year. </p><p>Nicky pushed her door open and stopped in his tracks, wide-eyed. "Mama, you look <em> beautiful</em>."</p><p>Agatha laughed, squeezing his arm. "So do you, my little Wednesday."</p><p>Nicky looked down at his own dress, playing with the hem, and Agatha watched the flitting of his eyes, replacing the raw confidence from just a moment ago.</p><p>"What’s up?" Agatha said, eyeing him.</p><p>"Jeremy said it’s weird to wear a dress," he said, picking at a loose thread. </p><p>Agatha resisted the urge to curse Jeremy out in front of Nicky.</p><p>"And what do <em> you </em> say?" she said instead, resting a hand on his head.</p><p>"I like being Wednesday," he replied, looking up at her. "Can I still wear it?"</p><p>Agatha looked at him, and made sure he was looking at her. "You wear whatever you want, whenever you want, baby," she said. Then, unable to resist, added, "Jeremy has dressed as the blue power ranger for the past three years in a row, so he doesn’t really get to contribute an opinion here. We’re operating way above his level."</p><p>"Yeah," Nicky said, nodding. "<em>Way </em> above his level."</p><p>"Plus," Agatha said, waggling her eyebrows. "Wednesday and Morticia <em> are </em> weird. That’s what makes them so cool."</p><p>"We look <em> so </em> cool," Nicky agreed, looking at them side by side in Agatha’s mirror, and Agatha felt that strange, motherly glow of invincibility. She was unstoppable. She looked weird, and cool. Morticia Addams was mysterious, and confident, and sexy.</p><p>She stuffed her laptop in her bag, and caught a sticky note that fluttered to the floor. It read: <em>r</em><em>io eval</em>. She groaned, deflating a little. The evaluation. The one she had told herself she would finish today, that she'd been actively not finishing for the past two weeks.</p><p>She stuffed the sticky note in with the laptop, half hoping it would crumple itself into something unrecognizable in the bottom of the bag.</p><p>"Let’s go, Wednesday," she said. "We've got a costume contest to win." </p><p>She followed Nicky to the car, a container of homemade cookies in hand, and felt the thrill rising in her chest. It was Halloween, and maybe it would be the only night of the year where she’d feel this good. Maybe tomorrow, the villagers would go right back to chasing her through the woods with their pitchforks and torches. But that was a problem for tomorrow. For Agatha, the tired divorcee, or Ms. Harkness, the second-grade teacher. Tonight was for Morticia, queen of the trash-bagged castle, <em> Atropa belladonna </em> of the ball—beautiful woman and deadly nightshade, all wrapped up in one. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The sun dipped behind the school, kids and their parents starting to arrive in the usual array of unoriginal costumes. Of course, no one had tied down the scarecrows, so she had to do it herself, the hay sticking to her velvet dress as Nicky ran off with the twins.</p><p>She walked to the haunted house as fast as she could, brushing hay off of her lap. She waved to the parent at the entrance, and ducked under the tarp. She heard volunteers calling to each other, checking their positions and the various flashing lights, and she wandered slowly through the passageways, looking for Rio.</p><p>Rio had never seen her dressed this way, and for some reason, the thought wouldn’t leave her alone. In fact, she hadn’t stopped thinking about it since she put on this dress. She caught her reflection in a mirror as she walked, scrutinizing her own makeup. </p><p>She stopped in her tracks under the archway to the center room. What had previously been a haunted library, Rio had transformed into a dining room. Looming cardboard figures in black cloaks sat at the table, their plates filled with horrors: snakes, eyeballs, a skull. Cobwebs strung across the corners, the fake candles on the table flickering, and Agatha stared. It looked incredible. </p><p>Across the room, Rio was buttoning a black cloak around a volunteer, helping obscure her into the corner of the room where she could jump out at unsuspecting children. Rio was dressed in a purple suit, her hair spray-painted green. Agatha smiled to herself. </p><p>She opened her mouth, and then closed it, still watching. Rio was talking to this red-haired woman, a volunteer Agatha had seen a couple times but never met—<em>Natasha, maybe? </em>Rio's hands secured the fabric around the woman’s neck and chest. She was <em> laughing</em>, and the woman, this unrealistically attractive, model-like woman, was leaning in close, her hand brushing Rio’s arm.</p><p>Something odd swept through Agatha’s stomach, heat crawling up her throat, thick and suffocating. It was too fucking hot in here. Someone needed to cut holes in the plastic for some goddamn ventilation, and <em> fuck</em>, she had definitely forgotten to put that on her list. The velvet stuck to her skin, and her legs suddenly needed to move, to leave this plastic-bagged dining room from hell. She moved backwards, tripping over a chair leg in her haste, and she cursed.</p><p>Rio and Natasha looked in her direction.</p><p>"Agatha?" Rio said in surprise, and her eyes fell to the dress. Her expression was impossible to read underneath the eerie makeup, but her eyes swept over Agatha in a dark, slow roll. </p><p>"Looks great in here," Agatha managed, the dress clinging to her skin. "And you–" she gestured vaguely to the woman, who was watching them both, "...look great, too, both of you. The Joker, that's a good one. Good pick."</p><p>Agatha was suddenly, acutely aware of the stretch of her neckline and the weight of the dress pulling her down. Her fingers twitched on the chair. She felt a little faint. Rio’s lips were still parted, but no words came. She was just <em>looking</em>, uncharacteristically speechless. </p><p>Agatha turned abruptly, almost tearing the plastic door in her effort to escape. She ducked blindly under curtains, ripping them wherever she could to let the air through, until her hands found metal. She slammed into the back door and burst free, gasping in the sudden open air.</p><p>"Ma’am?" she heard behind her, and she startled at both the wind and the voice. She realized suddenly that it was dark.</p><p>"Happy," she said, hand pressed to her chest. "Are you supposed to be scaring people?"</p><p>"No, ma’am; I’m here to comfort any of the kids that get too freaked out, so that their parents don’t sue us."</p><p>"You might want to ease up on the element of surprise, <em>Jesus</em>." Agatha held a hand on the top of her head, still reeling. "And don’t call me ma’am, I’m not that old." </p><p>She almost wiped the hand over her face, and then remembered her painstaking makeup. What the <em> fuck </em> had just happened to her? Was it a hot flash? Maybe she <em> was </em> that old, and she was finally falling into the looming clutches of menopause.</p><p>"Okay…<em> Agatha</em>," Happy said, putting a hand to her elbow. "Are you doing alright?"</p><p>Agatha blinked and looked at him. "I changed my mind. That was too weird; did that feel weird to you?"</p><p>"Yes, Ma’am, very weird."</p><p>"Great." Agatha brushed her hair back. "I’m fine. Thank you for working tonight."</p><p>"You kidding? I wouldn’t miss it; best night of the year."</p><p>Agatha patted him on the shoulder affectionately, and pushed Rio firmly out of her head, along with the mysterious, beautiful woman who was maybe named Natasha but hopefully something more boring. She blinked away Rio’s hands on her shoulder, and the shape of her smile under the wide, crooked lipstick.</p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>It was almost eight before Agatha finally sat down, the crowd starting to dwindle. She perched on one of the picnic benches, rolling her aching ankles inside her boots, and Wanda handed her half a churro and a cup of cider. The soft glow of string lights flickered against Wanda’s red gloves, the satin of her hood pulled snug over her head.</p><p>"Don’t tell Ralph," she said, "but there’s a little surprise in there for you."</p><p>Agatha raised her eyebrows and took a sip, the faint taste of whiskey hitting the back of her tongue underneath the sweet spice. </p><p>"You’re the greatest gift to this earth," Agatha said, clinking her paper cup against Wanda’s. "Where’s that tall, dapper husband of yours?"</p><p>"He took Tommy home after he ate, like, ten chicken fingers, ran twenty laps around the field, and then almost threw up."</p><p>"That kid’s like a mini Wade Bogs."</p><p>"I don’t even want to talk about it," Wanda laughed. "How do you feel?"</p><p>Agatha felt the heat of the whiskey unfurl in her chest, and watched a group of kids playing with one of the scarecrows, their costumes askew and faces flushed. Not too far away, Billy was pushing Nicky on the swings.</p><p>"Really fucking good, actually," Agatha whispered. </p><p>The Halloween Harvest had been a decided success. From the sheer size of the crowd, the number of people who'd come up to chat with her, it was clear the entire town and then some had shown up. Ralph and his journalist <em> friend</em>—a twenty-something blonde dressed as Catwoman—had kept their distance. Ralph seemed far more preoccupied with the quality of the stitching on her costume, judging by his line of sight, and Agatha had been more than happy to stay out of their way. If Ralph wanted a quote, Catwoman was going to have to chase her down, which felt unlikely given the height of her heels.</p><p>The only incident had been a kindergartner named Charlie eating too much candy and throwing up behind the playground before his parents had a chance to intervene. But Happy had sped to the scene and cornered it off with  authority. Even <em> Kristy </em> had failed to find a single thing to complain about, inspecting the decorations before giving Agatha a reluctant grimace that almost resembled a smile.</p><p>"The haunted house looked amazing, by the way," Wanda said. "Best I’ve ever seen it."</p><p>"It was all Rio," Agatha admitted without thinking.</p><p>She’d done an airtight job of keeping Rio out of her head, but now, she'd cracked her own seal. The unease crept back in, and she felt the slow roll of Rio's gaze against her ribs. She sipped at her cider, willing back the high from a second ago, wanting to feel it stretch over her chest in that fuzzy way. </p><p>"Nice work, you two." </p><p>Agatha looked up and rolled her eyes. Paul approached them slow, hands in his pockets of his black suit, sunglasses dangling from his hand.</p><p>"<em>Men in Black</em>?" Wanda said. "You can do better than that."</p><p>Agatha hid her laugh behind her cup, and then cleared her throat. "You didn’t tell me you were coming." </p><p>"What are you talking about? I called you yesterday."</p><p>"You told me <em> Ralph </em> was coming," she corrected, "not you."</p><p>"I thought that was implied."</p><p>Wanda sat back, eyeing them with interest. Agatha refused to look at her.</p><p>"You look great, by the way," Paul said, gesturing to Agatha’s dress. "Morticia again, right?"</p><p>Of course he fucking remembered. </p><p>Wanda cleared her throat, slipping out from the bench. "I’m going to go make sure the boys are good," she said, and looked pointedly at Agatha before walking away.</p><p>Paul took her seat, and Agatha felt the discomfort settle. It was unfair, she knew, but there nonetheless.</p><p>"Listen," Paul said. "I know you and I haven’t always seen eye to eye, in regards to the job." </p><p>Agatha snorted, eyes fixed on a spot in the distance.</p><p>"But I’ve always respected you. And I know things have been tough recently, so I just wanted to, I don’t know, say that I’m here, for you, you know? If you ever want to grab a drink, and talk."</p><p>Agatha stared at him. "Paul," she said finally. "You call me maybe once every three to four months, when you need something from me. I know we used to be friends, but we’re in our forties now, and you <em> barely </em> know me. Cut the bullshit. What is this about?"</p><p>Paul sighed, running a hand through his hair, and looked at her, a little exasperated.</p><p>"I’m trying to ask you out, Agatha."</p><p>A sudden gust of wind blew past them, rustling the remains of discarded paper cups. She thought of a rooftop in Boston, and the pavement underneath a pink neon sign, and the double doors of the auditorium opening to the cold. She thought about Rio’s melting ice pack, and that scrawled list of to-do’s to be crossed off by today. She remembered the loops and scrawls under smudges of black dust, gathering first at the edges of the board, and then under the slow scrape of her fingernail. Some part of her had known since yesterday that she would have to cross this off, too. What a waste of black velvet.</p><p>"I was getting there," Paul added, and she heard the unmistakable note of deflation.</p><p>Agatha kept her eyes trained on the kids playing across the yard. She exhaled through her nose, her knee bouncing. This wasn’t catastrophic. Paul wasn’t important enough to be catastrophic. He wasn’t edgy enough to qualify as a mistake, either. In fact, he wasn’t anything enough that she could even call one dinner date a bad idea. This was, technically, a normal thing that normal people did. </p><p>She'd been separated for four months, which wasn’t that long, but maybe long enough. Maybe it was time for Normal again. Maybe it was time to let someone take her to dinner while they pulled out her chair and asked, "How was your day?" And she could pluck an olive off the toothpick in her martini and say something seductive, like: "I don’t mix work and play," like people did in old movies before they had sex, or pulled off a diamond heist, or got shot sixteen times in the chest with a machine gun. </p><p>Or, maybe instead of trying something new, or even something normal, she just needed to try <em> something</em>. Maybe it was time to get under someone’s skin, and then up against it. </p><p>Paul wasn’t so bad, anyway, right? He used to show up at her first apartment with ice cream and beer, and they would watch reruns of <em> Survivor </em>over education theory flash cards. He was even funny, sometimes, in a goofy, inept kind of way. </p><p>She looked down at the cider in her hands. She swirled the last drops at the bottom of the cup, but the words refused to come. The silence stretched across the picnic table, her fingers tightening around the paper. Maybe it would be time tomorrow.</p><p>She stood abruptly, crumpling the cup in her fist, and untangled her legs from the picnic table.</p><p>"I have to go," she said, smoothing her dress. "Teacher’s lounge, to check the… supplies. I’ll—let me get back to you."</p><p>"Agatha, wait–" she heard him call, but she didn’t turn, her toes pinching in her boots as she sped across asphalt.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The teachers’ lounge smelled of mixed leftovers, the remains of the potluck dinner for the staff and volunteers. She picked up a cold chicken drumstick from a foil tray and tore into it with her teeth, not bothering with a plate. The end of her sleeve dangled dangerously into a casserole dish, and she rolled them both up, switching hands, drumstick in her mouth. She was getting oil and grease on her dress, and she didn’t care. She wanted to rip it off entirely and hide under the table like a little kid at a picnic who didn’t want to be found.</p><p>"Hey."</p><p>Agatha snapped her eyes to Rio, standing in the doorway. How was this woman somehow nowhere to be found when Agatha needed her, and always fucking standing in a doorway when she didn’t?</p><p>Agatha dropped the bone in the trash can by her feet, finally reaching for a napkin, and took in Rio’s costume in the light.</p><p>The purple polyester was brighter under the fluorescence, her hair still stiff with green. Her gaudy makeup was fading, collecting at the lines around her mouth where she would have been grinning and yelling. The white and red smeared across her face, and Agatha noted regretfully that the effect added to her look. </p><p>Rio was similarly taking her in, her eyes dragging down the length of the dress, again. Not saying anything, <em> again</em>. After a long moment of conspicuous silence, she grabbed a bottle of water and dropped heavily onto the couch. Agatha inexplicably wanted to ask where that <em> woman </em> was, but she kept her mouth shut. </p><p>"Did you make these?" Rio asked, pointing to the last cookie remaining in Agatha’s tupperware. "I didn’t know you could bake."</p><p>Agatha glared at her. "Of course I can bake. They’re my famous chocolate chip cookies. The parents go rabid for them, even when they’re coming for my throat."</p><p>"Rabid?" Rio said, quirking an eyebrow. "What’s the secret ingredient? Blood of your enemies?"</p><p>"I’m not telling <em> you</em>." Agatha crossed her arms. It felt petulant, even as she said it.</p><p>"Okay," Rio drawled, eyes flaring in mock offense, and then settled back against the cushion. She stretched out her leg in front of her. </p><p>"I saw Nicky’s costume, by the way. He looked awesome." She dug a thumb into the side of her knee, and Agatha watched. "I told him Wednesday was my favorite."</p><p>"I feel like I should be offended," Agatha muttered, leaning a hip against the table. Something was still needling at her, something like irritation, but hotter and more bitter. </p><p>Rio eyed her, and her hand stilled on her knee. </p><p>"I said she <em> was </em> my favorite," she said, eyes trailing over Agatha’s neckline. "Past tense."</p><p>Agatha felt that instant prickle of heat on the back of her neck under her straight, heavy hair. She swallowed, focusing on Rio’s leg.</p><p>"How’s the mysterious injury?" </p><p>"Fine."</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, hands smoothing over her dress. </p><p>She thought of the way Rio had looked at her dress in the haunted house, mouth open. Maybe if this dress was all-powerful, she could at least use it to her advantage before she returned it to her closet for another decade. </p><p>Agatha took three slow, purposeful steps closer, and Rio watched her. Agatha's shins bumped against the couch, and she was standing over her now, Rio’s injured leg stretched just to the side of her own. her other knee brushing against Agatha’s. </p><p>"Tell me what happened," she said firmly. </p><p>Rio looked up at her, her eyes dark. Agatha tried not to blink under the marble shine of her stare under the white makeup.</p><p>"No," Rio said simply, but her voice was low, her lips quirked with interest. </p><p>Agatha wondered briefly if she looked like Nicky, standing there wearing her<em> serious </em> face, and if Rio was trying not to laugh at her. </p><p>"Why not?" Agatha pressed, nudging Rio's knee lightly with her own. Rio's breath hitched, flinching at the contact. "What, did someone <em>do </em> something to you?"</p><p>Rio scoffed. "I was wondering when this was going to come up."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"I was wondering how long it would take for you to assume that I’m in some terrible situation that I need to be saved from. I <em> pulled a muscle</em>. I don’t owe you all the dirty details."</p><p>Agatha gritted her teeth, and she could feel her forehead vein pulsing. She opened her mouth, and was interrupted by a knock at the open door. Paul was standing there, looking between them, and Agatha took an automatic step back. Her molten irritation cooled to mild dread and sank low in her stomach.</p><p>"Hey," he said, stepping in. "Sorry to interrupt, I just wanted to— can we talk for a second?"</p><p>Agatha resisted the urge to growl out loud, and she looked at Rio.</p><p>"Don’t mind me," Rio said lightly, crossing her arms. "I’m just going to eat this apparently god-sent cookie and mind my own business."</p><p>Agatha glared at her and beckoned Paul towards the door.</p><p>"I didn’t mean to pressure you," he started. "I know things just ended with you and Josh, but I figured it was a ‘now or never’ situation? And…yeah. To be clear: I would like to have dinner with you sometime. If you would like that."</p><p>Agatha was at a loss. She still couldn’t think of a good reason to say no. But was that enough of a reason to say yes?</p><p>"Paul, I…" she trailed off, her eyes fixing on the paper ghost on the wall. It hung askew, looking tired. <em> Just a few more hours</em>, she thought, looking at its torn bottom corner. She didn’t know whether she was talking to herself or the ghost, and then she thought that maybe it was a cry for help, that she was commiserating with a piece of paper.</p><p>"Hey, Agatha?" Rio called from across the room. </p><p>
<em> ‘Minding my own business,’ my ass. </em>
</p><p>"What," she snapped, secretly relieved at the interruption.</p><p>"Tell me the secret ingredient."</p><p>"I’m kind of in the middle of something here," Agatha said, gesturing in the general direction of Paul’s face. "I will email you the recipe—"</p><p>"No," Rio repeated, her voice raspier this time. She rubbed at her mouth, then cleared her throat, her brow furrowing slightly. "I <em> really </em> think you should tell me."</p><p>Agatha frowned, and turned to face her fully. </p><p>"Why—" she started. And then she saw the way Rio's breath was coming in shorter bursts, the red creeping up her throat. The dread slammed fully into place, and Agatha’s stomach dropped.</p><p>"Oh, fuck me."</p><p>She stared in horror. After twenty years in a classroom, she knew the signs by heart:<em> allergic reaction</em>. Her legs were already moving.</p><p>"Coriander seeds," she said frantically, hopping over someone’s discarded bag to reach the couch. "<em>No one </em> is allergic to coriander, are you kidding me?"</p><p>"<em>I’m </em> allergic to coriander," Rio coughed, her eyes wide. </p><p>"How bad?"</p><p>"Bad," Rio yelled, looking around wildly, a hand at her throat.</p><p>Agatha didn’t think, forcing Rio back onto the couch, her voice leveling automatically. "Where’s your epipen? Do you have one?" </p><p>"Backpack, I think," she said, still coughing, and Agatha spotted it next to the armrest. She dropped to her knees, rifling through the pockets. "I don’t see it. Paul, Get the first aid kit. It’s in the corner cabinet; there should be one in there." She kept rifling through the backpack, her hands grasping at loose papers and granola bar wrappers.</p><p>"Your backpack is insane. What are you, twelve?" She winced at the familiar sting of a paper cut.</p><p>"I can’t believe you fucking <em> poisoned </em> me," Rio wheezed. </p><p>"How would I know you were allergic to fucking <em> coriander</em>?" She checked the last pocket for the third time. "<em>Paul</em>!"</p><p>"Fuck, I’m looking, I’m looking!" Paul shouted, rifling through the cabinet.</p><p>"You made me fill out that stupid form," Rio said, still talking despite her heaving breaths, "on the first week of school. Emergency stuff, medical, <em> allergies</em>! You didn’t even <em> read </em> it?"</p><p>"Of course I didn’t fucking read it!" Agatha yelled, finally flinging the backpack to the side in one second of panic. The bag hit the empty box of cookies, papers spilling out over the floor.</p><p>"I got it, I got it!" Paul yelled, pulling the epipen free from the plastic bin and plucking off the safety release. <em> Thank god he knows what he’s doing</em>, Agatha thought briefly.</p><p>"Excuse me?" </p><p>A muffled voice came from the doorway. A cloaked figure poked their head into the room, just behind Paul’s shoulder. </p><p>Paul turned, and came face-to-face with a grotesque, lifelike Halloween mask, crisscrossed with muscled flesh and blood. </p><p>He let out a high-pitched scream. His arm shot out and sank the epipen directly into the masked figure’s thigh. </p><p>Agatha heard a gasp, and the loud, definite <em>click</em> of the pen. Then, for a split second, there was absolute, deafening silence. Paul took a step back, and the empty plastic clattered on the floor.</p><p>"Did you—" the masked figure ripped off the rubber, and of course, it was Natasha<em>,</em> clutching at her leg. "Oh my god, did you just <em> stab </em> me?"</p><p>"Paul, for <em> fuck’s sake</em>!" Agatha exploded, and now Natasha was yelling too. </p><p>"Was that an <em> epipen</em>? What does that do? What’s going to happen to me? Oh my god."</p><p>Agatha heard Rio’s ragged breathing behind her, and her legs kicked into action again. She pushed past Paul and Natasha at a full sprint, grabbing the doorframe as she rounded the corner. She stumbled in the hallway just long enough to kick off her boots, one hitting the wall with a thud, the other landing somewhere behind her. </p><p>She reached the door of her classroom, and grabbed the first aid kit whole without even looking. She spotted Jen and Wanda in the hallway, staring, and she bellowed, breathless: "WITH ME."</p><p>She didn’t stop, unzipping the red bag as she ran. Bandages and gauze fell over the hallway, and she grasped the epipen, the bag falling away entirely as she nearly skidded back into the lounge. </p><p>She made it right to Rio, half collapsed on the couch, coughing, reaching for the pen in Agatha’s hand. Her red-rimmed eyes met Agatha’s.</p><p>"I got it," Agatha said quickly, batting her hand away. "One, two, three." She jabbed the pen, and heard the second sharp <em> click</em>. Rio exhaled through her nose, her eyes widening. Agatha held the pen in for three more seconds, and then tossed it aside, watching Rio’s face with laser focus.</p><p>She felt eerily calm. It was always the first way she knew there was a crisis—the way the world went quiet around the rushing of blood in her ears, her fingers steady, everything too bright and sharp. </p><p>Her hand stayed firmly on Rio’s thigh, massaging the site. She counted twelve slow seconds before Rio took a deep, clear breath. She counted ten more after that before she took one of her own. </p><p>She sat back on her heels, watching as Rio inhaled and exhaled. Agatha should have lifted her hand by now. It wasn’t needed anymore, but still, her fingers pressed into the muscle. </p><p>The noise of the room filtered back in—Jen gripping Natasha’s arm, holding the empty epipen between them. Wanda’s finger was pointed so close to Paul's throat it was almost touching him, in the middle of delivering an earful that looked like a terrifying combination of mother’s and principal’s wrath.</p><p>Rio’s leg shifted under Agatha’s palm, the thick cord of muscle flexing. Rio tipped her head back lightly against the couch cushion, her eyes slipping closed. Her chest rose and fell, still too fast, and her fingers brushed against Agatha’s, and stayed there.</p><p>A thought flickered through Agatha’s mind, absurd and fleeting, but insistent. She was kneeling in front of Rio, her hand on her thigh, like some strange reverse of the night they'd met, and Agatha remembered way Rio had looked at her.</p><p>Rio had wrapped around her in the most impossible ways, like <em> Solanum dulcamara </em>—‘Bittersweet’—the gentler, slow-release cousin of Deadly Nightshade. Not mind-bending like the belladonna; <em>Bittersweet </em> poured straight into the body instead. It worked its way in through the muscle, through the lungs, through the soft skin on the back of her hand. </p><p>Her grip slid from Rio’s thigh to her elbow.</p><p>"Let’s go," she murmured, hauling her upright. Rio’s feverish warmth radiated through her suit. "Hospital’s ten minutes away. I’m driving."</p><p>She caught Jen’s arm as they reached the door, voice low. "Take Natasha in. If she threatens to sue anyone, make sure it’s Paul, not the school, or me, for some fucking reason."</p><p>Jen almost laughed, a crazed look of panic on her face, and Agatha clapped her on the shoulder.</p><p>"Welcome to the grown-up table, J."</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The car ride was short but harrowing, and Agatha swerved around every corner even though the roads were practically empty. Everyone in town really <em> had </em> been at her event. She took a moment to self-congratulate, and then looked at Rio.</p><p>She had her forehead pressed to the window, her breath fogging the glass in sharp bursts. Her free hand clutched at her chest. "I swear to god, Agatha, if you don’t fucking slow down, I’m going to throw up in your car."</p><p>"You’re just feeling the epi," Agatha said, speeding through the fifth consecutive stop sign. "You’re going to be fine."</p><p>Rio groaned, bracing a hand on the dashboard, the other clutched to her sternum. "God, I feel like a fucking lab rat on cocaine."</p><p>"You’re acting like it, too," Agatha muttered, honking at a cyclist who was three inches from losing an arm.</p><p>Rio whipped her head toward her, pupils blown. <em> "</em>And whose fucking fault is that?"</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth, but before she could form a retort, Rio lunged for the glove compartment, wrenching it open with shaky hands. Mostly loose receipts and an old pack of gum. She grabbed the first handful of trash and hurled it at Agatha.</p><p>"Rio," Agatha said, her voice rising. "It was an <em> accident</em>."</p><p>"FUCK <em> YOU</em>," Rio shouted. Crumpled parking lot stubs and stale gum wrappers pelted Agatha’s shoulder and flew across her field of vision.</p><p>By some miracle, they made it to the emergency room in one piece, albeit at full volume. Somehow, a nurse understood what they were saying through all the yelling, and brought over a wheelchair for Rio’s shaky, unsteady legs.</p><p>Rio was still fully dressed as the joker, purple suit and green hair, makeup smeared. She didn’t even stand out, the waiting room full of people in various costumes and states of distress—a Batman with his arm wrapped in bloody gauze, Beetlejuice with a hand clasped to her eye.</p><p>"What happened?" a nurse was asking.</p><p>"<em>She </em> fucking poisoned me," Rio yelled, pointing at Agatha. "Is this because of the Charles Manson thing? I said I was fucking sorry, I bought you a <em> mug</em>," she continued, her voice hoarse now, and Agatha’s mouth fell open. </p><p>The nurses swiveled their heads to stare at Agatha as Rio continued. The pitch of her accusations bounced off of every wall as a nurse forcibly lowered her into the wheelchair.</p><p>"Who the fuck puts <em>coriander</em> in chocolate chip cookies?"</p><p>"It tastes like citrus," Agatha yelled back. "What kind of grown-ass adult with a life-threatening allergy eats a cookie with a secret ingredient, and doesn’t have an epipen?"</p><p>"What kind of grown-ass adult has to bake cookies just so that the PTA will fucking jerk off to you like they used to?" Rio was still yelling, twisted around in the wheelchair even as the nurses wheeled her away, her arms waving wildly. "Oh my god, they’re all right, Agatha! you are fucking crazy!"</p><p>"<em>You’re </em> fucking crazy!" Agatha stormed after them, shoving a rolling chair out of her way. It clattered against the wall, the noise echoing down the corridor.</p><p>"Okay, ma’am," a nurse said, stepping into her path with a firm palm up. "I'm going to have to ask you to wait here."</p><p>Agatha stopped short, fists clenched tightly.</p><p>"Are you serious? She’s kidding, I obviously didn’t POISON HER!" She yelled the last words, making sure Rio could still hear her as she wheeled farther down the hallway. She sucked in a breath, chest rising and falling. She might as well have injected herself.</p><p>"If I <em> did </em> poison her," she muttered, still staring after Rio, "she’d be so fucking dead."</p><p>Rio was long out of sight, and the nurse—<em>Darcy </em>, according to her badge—was lazily chewing her gum. She tapped the clipboard with her pen.</p><p>"So, legally, I have to ask: have you ever considered poisoning that woman, yourself, or anyone else?"</p><p>Agatha whipped her head around to stare.</p><p>"<em>No</em>." </p><p>Darcy clicked her pen and jotted something down. "Okay, but you did just say you wanted her dead, so—"</p><p>"I did not say I <em> wanted her dead.</em>" Agatha grabbed the clipboard out of her hands and slammed it on the desk next to them. "Where did they find you?"</p><p>Darcy crossed her arms. "Wow. That was rude. What if I went to Cornell?"</p><p>"Did you?" </p><p>"No. But I did take a Masterclass. Twenty-first century, bitch." Darcy struck a pose.</p><p>Agatha gritted her teeth. "I changed my mind. I <em> have </em> thought about poisoning someone."</p><p>"Don’t worry, babe," Darcy said. "We’ll take good care of your girlfriend and I’ll let you know when you can go see her." </p><p>"She’s—" Agatha started, but the words died on her tongue. Darcy was already returning to her station behind the desk. At a loss, she collapsed into the nearest plastic chair and, in a sudden burst of frustration, kicked the metal trash can next to her. It toppled over, tissues spilling across the floor.</p><p>Four people in the waiting room turned to stare at her. Agatha slumped deeper into the chair, head in her hands, and the exhaustion rolled over her in the wake of adrenaline. </p><p>A loud, wet noise broke the silence, and Agatha looked up. A boy dressed as Frankenstein stared at her as he blew his nose. He glanced at the overturned trash can, then at the tissue in his hand. Then back at the trash can again. Then back at the tissue. Agatha leaned forward, plucked the tissue from his hand, and tossed it onto the floor with the rest of the trash.</p><p>"I have mono," the boy said. He turned and walked back to the chair next to his mother.</p><p>"Of course you fucking do," Agatha muttered, and leaned her head back against the wall.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>It was almost eleven when they let Agatha in to see Rio. They'd put her in the pediatric wing—limited space on Halloween night—and Agatha tried to keep her flashbacks at bay as they walked down the colorful hallways. Hospitals always tried throwing up patterned wallpaper to cover the fear and grief that lived under the plaster. As if a string of cartoon monkeys holding hands could erase the anxiety that ripped through her chest at the sight of the ICU door.</p><p>She thought of Nicky, his first precarious taste of the world, three months too soon, with the umbilical cord wrapped around his neck, face turning blue. He was so tiny, his entire body could fit cradled in Josh's two hands, skin like tissue paper, tube taped to his nose and mouth. She shuddered. Of all her ability to stay calm in crisis, nothing scraped at her nerves quite like the pediatric wing.</p><p>She'd called Josh and Wanda, said goodnight to Nicky, and checked in with Jen, who'd spent an hour at the hospital with Natasha before she was discharged. Jen had been <em> conspicuously </em> certain that Natasha wouldn’t be pursuing legal action. Agatha didn’t know exactly how Jen had pulled that off, but she could make a solid guess, and she made a mental note to add that to the list of discussion topics at their next happy hour.</p><p>Agatha pulled the door open quietly, but Rio was awake. </p><p>She was clean of makeup, her hair brown again, damp and curling at the ends. A few stray strands clung to the curve of her neck. The only evidence of The Joker was the folded pile of purple by the bathroom door, and the towels in the trash can, streaked with green hairspray. Something about her like this—hair still wet, eyelids heavy with sleep—pulled at Agatha’s chest. </p><p>"Hey," she said, lingering in the doorway, unsure how much of Rio’s anger had faded.</p><p>Rio half-smiled, her voice groggy. "Why are you still here?"</p><p>Agatha laughed on an exhale and stepped inside. "I’m sorry for <em> accidentally </em> poisoning you. Hospital bill’s on me."</p><p>"Seriously?" </p><p>"Already taken care of."</p><p>"That's... thank you," Rio said, finally. She yawned, the rest of her words coming slow. "Sorry I accused you of attempted murder in public."</p><p>"Let’s call it even." Agatha waved her hand. "It was the epi." </p><p>"It was the epi," Rio repeated, scrunching her nose.</p><p>Agatha pointed to the chair in the corner beside the bed, raising her eyebrows in question, and Rio nodded as she settled comfortably in. </p><p>"Nice room. Sophisticated." Agatha eyed a poster of a giraffe above Rio’s head, and Rio rolled her eyes. At least, she tried, but it was really more of a long, slow blink. </p><p>The door opened again, a woman’s head and shoulder poking through. The woman glanced at Agatha, then at Rio.</p><p>"Yeah, it’s fine," Rio muttered, shifting in bed.</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow at her as the woman stepped inside.</p><p>"Dr. Danvers," she said, shaking Agatha’s hand.</p><p>"Agatha Harkness," she responded, clearing her throat. She wasn’t sure what else she was supposed to say. She hoped the doctor wouldn’t ask her anything else.</p><p>"Like we discussed," Dr. Danvers said, referencing her clipboard. "Everything looks okay for now, and we can let you go in a couple hours. I’ll prescribe you some steroids for the next few days to make sure we don’t see you back here."</p><p>"You sure you don’t want to prescribe me anything else?" Rio asked with a smirk, raising her eyebrows. The doctor smiled.</p><p>"Yeah, I wasn’t finished," she said. "The leg is likely a mild knee sprain—sounds like you know the drill with that one, so just keep icing and rest a little next week, and you should be fine. Call if it gets worse. I also wrote you a new prescription for your inhaler, so that’ll be ready before you leave. And then, I noticed you don’t have an emergency contact listed; did you want to put someone down?" She glanced at Agatha.</p><p>Rio’s face flushed. Agatha stared. She'd never seen her do that, not once.</p><p>"Uh, no," Rio said. "It’s fine. My roommate doesn’t have a phone."</p><p>"You have a roommate?" Agatha said, forgetting to stay quiet, then processed the rest of her sentence. "Who…<em> doesn’t have a phone</em>?"</p><p>Rio grinned. "She’s meant for bigger things than modern technology. Or so she says."</p><p>"Okay then," the doctor said. "Any other questions for me?"</p><p>"Nope. Thanks, Dr. D."</p><p>Agatha exhaled, leaning her head against the wall once the doctor left.</p><p>"You have asthma?" The words slipped out. Agatha felt the looming unease of the truth. She might know that Rio was ambidextrous, and drank her coffee black, and knew Charles Manson quotes. She might even know what the tattoo on her ribcage looked like in painstaking detail. But she didn’t <em> know </em> her, not really. </p><p>"Yup." Rio scrubbed a hand over her face.</p><p>"Didn’t know this hospital bill was covering all of your preexisting conditions," Agatha muttered. "Why don’t you check some moles out, while you’re at it?"</p><p>"I didn’t ask you to pay."</p><p>"You have student insurance. That would be cruel and unusual."</p><p>Rio smiled, and then winced, her hand falling to her knee. </p><p>"Rio." Agatha turned her head just enough to watch her. "Why won’t you just tell me what happened?"</p><p>Rio looked sullen, laying her head back on the bed, and brushed her damp hair out of her eyes. "Because it’s embarrassing," she said finally, tapping her knee. </p><p>"You’re kidding," Agatha said, incredulous. "You’ve watched me make a fool of myself on no less than three separate occasions in the last two months, and you’re holding out on me because you’re <em> embarrassed</em>?"</p><p>Agatha was relieved despite her indignation. Until now, she hadn’t been sure Rio had ever felt embarrassed a day in her life. <em> Embarrassing</em>, she could handle.</p><p>"Fine," Rio said, tucking an elbow behind her head in her hospital gown. Her eyes trailed over a <em>Family Circus</em> comic taped to the ceiling. </p><p>"A couple nights ago, a group of frat guys were in. Standard twenty-one year-olds. We get them all the time."</p><p>Agatha wrinkled her nose in mild disgust, and Rio caught the look with a dry smile. "They're usually the most harmless, because they’re secretly terrified. It’s even a little fun, sometimes."</p><p>Agatha swallowed, drawing an unwelcome parallel.</p><p>"This one guy was super drunk, and he was the one spending all the money. Rich parents, probably. He said he’d pay me six hundred bucks if I did ten reverse crunches off of his shoulders."</p><p>Agatha felt her jaw fall open. "But why… I mean, what does that even… <em> do </em> for him?"</p><p>Rio shrugged. "He didn’t really know what he was doing; he just wanted to be obnoxious in front of his friends. But I’ve done much more for six hundred. Reverse crunches are no problem." She picked at a small scratch on her hand. "So he lifted me up and I got my legs up around his face."</p><p>Agatha blinked, trying to keep her expression even slightly neutral. </p><p>"And I went for it. It’s mostly all legs at that angle, anyway. My thighs were definitely squeezing his carotid artery, so I was kind of hoping he’d pass out, but he didn’t."</p><p>Agatha tried and failed not to imagine it, Rio’s thighs squeezing slowly, the man falling to his knees.</p><p>"And then what?" she asked. She couldn’t tell if she was more horrified or awed.</p><p>"I had already tweaked my knee at school, trying to keep Gemma from jumping off of the slide, because she was putting all her fucking weight on me."</p><p>She was staring at the ceiling comic again.</p><p>"So I had my legs around this guy and I could feel my knee pulling every time I flexed it, but I had already done three, so I just kept going."</p><p>Agatha stared at her. </p><p>"That’s it?" she said finally. "You knew your leg was already hurt, and you <em>hung upside down</em> after a fourteen hour day? That’s unbelievably stupid."</p><p>Rio glared at her. "I’m sorry, would you have preferred that some beefy dude threw me into a wall and broke my fucking leg?"</p><p>"<em>Jesus</em>, of course not. Just… why didn’t you want to tell me <em> that</em>? It doesn’t really feel like that big a deal."</p><p>Rio’s fingers traced her knee, and leaned her head back again. She closed her eyes for a second, considering, and then rolled her head towards Agatha. </p><p>"You know how I told you I used to be a dancer? Like, a real one?"</p><p>Agatha nodded. </p><p>"I was good," Rio said, and her eyes had taken on a wistful look. Agatha felt that same twinge in her chest.</p><p>"I was really, really fucking good."</p><p>Rio smiled, her eyes unfocused, and then her face shifted into something else. "One day, something didn’t feel right, and I performed anyway. It was a big competition; I couldn’t just go home. But in the middle of the piece, my knee twisted, and I landed wrong. And that was… it. I somehow managed to do more damage to my knee with a single fall than... well, probably getting thrown into a wall."</p><p>Agatha swallowed. Rio’s voice was detached, clinical, but she could feel the weight of her words landing.</p><p>"I was nineteen, and I hadn’t gone to college because I was making a living winning. I was supporting myself, and then it was all just… gone."</p><p>Agatha’s hands tightened around the armrest. "What about your parents?" </p><p>Rio shook her head, looking at the wall.</p><p>"It <em> was </em> a stupid reason," she said after a beat. "It was a stupid reason to get injured. No crazy accident, not even a mental breakdown leading to my downfall. Just one sore morning, and one wrong step."</p><p>"You know that’s not what I meant," Agatha said, her voice low. </p><p>"It happened, and I got my shit together, and I’m here now. I like teaching. And I’m making money dancing, technically."</p><p>The guarded look was back in Rio's eyes, the one that meant Agatha should definitely stop talking.</p><p>"You’re asthmatic and you have a bad knee," she said anyway. "And you're dancing in stilettos in a smoky club after working a full day at school. That can’t be good for you—you’re showing up late and passing out in your car."</p><p>"Back off," Rio snapped, quick and loud. Her voice was edged with exhaustion, and her hands fisted into the blanket. "I’m thirty fucking years old, Agatha; I’m not a <em> child. </em>" </p><p>Agatha pressed her lips together, eyes flitting away from Rio’s hard stare and landing on the side table between them. A container of red jello sat on top of a coloring placemat and a packet of crayons. Rio followed her gaze, and her nostrils flared.</p><p>"They have those in all of the rooms," she said.</p><p>Agatha squinted, a smile pulling at her lips.</p><p>"You colored the elephant."</p><p>"I was fucking bored<em>,</em>" Rio grumbled, and turned to face the ceiling again. </p><p>Agatha glanced toward the window, catching Dr. Danvers walk by, her blond ponytail swinging. Agatha found herself wondering suddenly if Rio found her attractive. The doctor was definitely—what had Rio called it? <em> A head bitch in charge</em>. Agatha looked at her and remembered what it felt like, having her hands around a clipboard, anchoring her to the command of the room. </p><p>She cleared her throat. "So," she said, watching Rio carefully. She had a fully formed question in her head, but what came out was: "Natasha."</p><p>"Wow," Rio shot back, eyeing her. "You want to talk about <em> that</em>? She's some kid's aunt from out-of-town, and <em>she</em> was flirting with <em>me</em>. I was totally above board."</p><p>"I'm sure," Agatha said, brushing her hair back. "She seems… nice. Jen said she’s not pressing charges on Paul."</p><p>"Jen?" Rio narrowed her eyes. "Jen stole my date, didn’t she?"</p><p>"Probably."</p><p>She groaned, tilting her head back, and then waggled her eyebrows. "At least I’ve got Dr. Danvers." </p><p>Agatha snorted, and felt the knot in her chest loosen a little. Asked and answered. "Look who’s finding the silver lining," she said dryly, inspecting the label on the jello cup. "The incidentally very tall, hot, silver lining."</p><p>Agatha was still wearing her dress, and her emergency sandals from her car, and she felt suddenly uncomfortable in the cold hospital room. She looked at Rio, pulling the blankets tighter around her shoulders.</p><p>It was <em> that moment</em>, Agatha knew. She had already exhausted the flimsy list of reasons she should still be there. She should say something boring and expected, like, "Well, I should be heading out," and then stand up and actually leave. She thought about the messy auditorium, waiting for her direction, and her empty house waiting for her after that.</p><p>"If you have to go," Rio said lightly, "don’t worry about it. I’m sure Nicky wants you back."</p><p>Agatha looked at her, lying there with circles under her eyes and no emergency contacts. They were three hours past crisis, and now Rio was just tired, and Agatha wondered if she had no one to call for non-emergencies, either.</p><p>Agatha looked at the red jello on the side table.</p><p>"You going to eat that?" she asked, already reaching for it.</p><p>Rio shook her head, her lips curving upwards. </p><p>"You <em> like </em> jello?" she said, disgusted as Agatha slurped. "That is surprising and terrible."</p><p>"Oh, sure, let’s talk about <em> terrible surprises</em>," Agatha said, her mouth full. She pointed to Rio with the spoon, and a small glob of jello landed on the floor. "Any other critical medical conditions I need to know about?"</p><p>"Enough. We’re watching TV."</p><p>Rio reached to the other side for the remote, and winced, the table just out of reach. Agatha stood wordlessly, circling to retrieve it. She set down her jello, her mouth sufficiently sweet, and turned the TV on. She perched on the side of her bed, flipping through the channels.</p><p>"What are you into?" she said, scrolling. "Reality? Documentary?"</p><p>"Wait, stop," Rio said, grabbing her arm. "Look."</p><p>Agatha snorted and set down the remote, taking in Morticia Addams on the screen with Wednesday. She felt Rio scoot over, and it was that tiny shift that made her realize she was sitting on Rio’s bed. She turned slightly, glancing at her. Rio was watching her.</p><p>"Are you going to sit like that the whole time?" Rio said. </p><p>"Oh. No, sorry." Agatha stood, smoothing down her dress.</p><p>"No, I meant—" Rio stifled a laugh. "Sit like a normal person. You look like Elf on a Shelf."</p><p>Agatha snorted, and eyed the empty spot. She hesitated. She was somewhat aware that it was odd, hesitating now, given how they'd met. But that was different—that was <em> before</em>. </p><p>She felt a yawn positively slam into her, eyes watering, and ran a hand over her face. <em> Fuck it, </em> she thought. Sitting uncomfortably was for people under forty. She leaned back, swinging her legs up on top of the blanket. She didn’t think about the soap smell from Rio’s face and hair, the faint chemical scent of hairspray, the heat radiating from her. She didn’t think about the way the thin mattress dipped under her weight, tilting Agatha just slightly towards her, their shoulders brushing.</p><p>Wednesday Addams was buying girl scout cookies on the TV, and when she said it, perfectly deadpan: "Are they made from real Girl Scouts?" They both burst out laughing, the bed shaking precariously and sending them further into peals of laughter.</p><p>Agatha didn’t think about the way Rio clutched at her leg as she laughed, fingers digging lightly into her thigh. The movement was familiar. Agatha’s hand, steady on purple nylon in the midst of chaos, and now, Rio’s grip fluttering over black velvet in reply. The symmetry was comforting. Agatha didn’t let herself wonder when Rio would let go.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Thirty minutes into the movie, Rio's head was starting to bob against her shoulder, and Agatha’s phone rang. She pulled herself out of the bed with some effort, showing the screen to Rio in explanation, and stepped out of the room, her chest still buoyant from the feeling of watching a good movie with good company.</p><p>"Hey."</p><p>She leaned against the wall opposite the small window in the door. She could see Rio, her eyes still heavy-lidded, focused on the movie. </p><p>"How’s she doing?" Wanda said through a yawn.</p><p>"Good," Agatha said. "Annoying. But good."</p><p>"Well, you <em> did </em> almost kill her."</p><p>"Thank you for the reminder." Agatha leaned her head back against the wall. The waiting room felt too far. "You still at school?" </p><p>"Yeah. Happy and I led the clean-up crew, and we’re just about done."</p><p>"Fuck, I’m sorry," Agatha said. "I should have come back to help."</p><p>"You have an acceptable excuse," Wanda said. "You’re a good friend. I just didn’t know <em> Rio </em> had made it to the friend circle."</p><p>Agatha felt her brow twitch, and bit at her peeling lower lip. She had been biting it too much recently. </p><p>"I wasn’t going to just leave her to find the hospital on her own," Agatha said finally. "She doesn’t live here."</p><p>"I’m sure she appreciates it," Wanda said, and if Agatha didn’t know her so well, she would have thought she was hinting at something. </p><p>"I owe you one." Agatha knew the majority of work would  come tomorrow, the heavy lifting and sweeping and mopping and disposing of dirty paper and fake blood. But she also knew how much weight she pulled, and the resulting weight of her absence.</p><p>"Hey," she added. "You know Alice? The PE teacher? What’s her deal?"</p><p>"She’s great," Wanda said. "One of those people that are just effortlessly cool. The kids are obsessed with her. We’re lucky we have her, honestly."</p><p>"Wow," Agatha said, a little surprised at the heartfelt endorsement. "Why have I never talked to her before?"</p><p>"Because you never talk to anyone," Wanda said. "But glad to hear your little time in the spotlight has an upside."</p><p>Agatha laughed, a hand to her forehead. She trailed off, leaning one of her feet back against the wall. She cleared her throat, and then went silent. </p><p>"What?" Wanda said.</p><p>"Nothing."</p><p>"Agatha."</p><p>She sighed. "Paul… asked me out."</p><p>"Well, about fucking time," Wanda said. "The man practically drools when you walk into a room. What did you say?"</p><p>"I didn’t. There were kind of more pressing issues at the time."</p><p>"What are you <em> going </em> to say?"</p><p>Agatha looked at Rio in the hospital bed, her collarbone peeking out of the gown. She'd turned on her side, curled up a little, her eyes glued to the screen. She looked strangely small under the blanket. </p><p>Dr. Danvers passed Agatha in the hallway, offering her a polite smile. Agatha turned, watching her straight posture.</p><p>"Dr. Danvers," she called. "Wanda—I have to go. I’ll call you tomorrow."</p><p>"Go out with him," Wanda said.</p><p>"What?" Agatha hissed into the phone, and looked at the doctor apologetically.</p><p>"Go out with Paul. You need to put yourself back out there. You haven’t had sex in like, what, a year? You really need to take the low-hanging fruit before—"</p><p>Agatha jabbed at the red button.</p><p>"Sorry," she said to the doctor, waiting patiently nearby.</p><p>"No problem. How can I help, Morticia?"</p><p>"Oh," Agatha said with a laugh, looking down at her dress. She'd forgotten she was still wearing it. "It’s Agatha."</p><p>"I know." Dr. Danvers smiled. </p><p>Agatha blinked, feeling suddenly flustered. "I just wanted to let you know—my…" she gestured to the room. "Rio’s emergency contact. You can just put me down."</p><p>"Okay, sure. I’ll have Darcy get that info from you on your way out."</p><p>"Thanks." Agatha looked up at the taller woman, her rolled up sleeves and hands in the pocket of her lab coat. She thought of Wanda’s words: <em> effortlessly cool. </em>Did everyone have that except her?</p><p>"How much longer do you need to keep her here?" Agatha asked. </p><p>"Probably not more than another hour, because of the asthma. Just want to make sure she’s in the clear."</p><p>"Got it. And just for my…additional knowledge," Agatha said, crossing her arms, "let’s say someone had asthma."</p><p>Dr. Danvers looked at her curiously.</p><p>"Not Rio, obviously," Agatha added, "But some other, random person with asthma. If <em> that </em> person worked at an enclosed location that was filled with cigarette smoke, anywhere from twenty to thirty hours a week, would that be considered safe?"</p><p>"I thought she was a teacher," Dr. Danvers said, narrowing her eyes. She was still eyeing Agatha with that look of intrigue.</p><p>"Right. She is," Agatha said. "Totally hypothetical. Just interested in expanding my medical knowledge."</p><p>"Right," the doctor repeated, smiling. "Well, in my professional opinion, <em> hypothetically</em>, no. That would definitely not be advised, and could certainly worsen symptoms."</p><p>"Great," Agatha said. "Thank you. I’ve learned a lot."</p><p>"Anytime. Feel free to go grab something from the cafeteria, by the way—they’re about to close for the night."</p><p>Agatha nodded, brushing her hair behind her ear, and peeked back into the room. Rio was still curled up, her eyes blinking long and slow. She yawned, the blanket slipping to the side, and Agatha felt the pull to adjust it. She clenched her hand at her side, and turned on her heel.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Agatha walked back down the hallway in her sandals, two cups of herbal tea in her hand. She wanted coffee, late as it was, but they'd run out, so she'd settled for peppermint. </p><p>She reached the door and was about to push it open with her shoulder when she caught a glimpse of Rio through the window. Agatha followed her gaze to Dr. Danvers, her ponytail swinging as her shoulders shook. Rio smirked, her tongue in the side of her cheek. </p><p>"Fuck," Agatha muttered, the cups starting to burn. She considered putting them on an empty gurney down the hall, then looked at Rio again, and set them down right where she stood. She paced then, a familiar, unwelcome feeling in her stomach.</p><p>She pulled her bag over her shoulder firmly, turning toward the waiting room. She'd only made it four steps before Dr. Danvers exited Rio’s room and called her name. Her real name, this time.</p><p>Agatha turned. "Dr. Danvers."</p><p>"Carol."</p><p>"Carol," Agatha repeated slowly.</p><p>"Here." Carol reached into her pocket and pulled out two colorful bandaids. She held them out in front of Agatha. "Do you have a preference?"</p><p>"I... don’t think I need one," Agatha said, "but thank you, anyway."</p><p>"Your finger is bleeding," Carol said. "Looks like a paper cut. We don’t really love open wounds around here."</p><p>Agatha glanced down in surprise, and her finger was, in fact, bleeding. She picked the bandaid with dinosaurs on it, because Nicky would like it. She put it on silently, slightly embarrassed to be receiving elementary first aid from, she was sure now, a pediatrician.</p><p>"I hope you don’t mind me asking," Carol said, "But what’s your deal? You and Rio?"</p><p>Agatha felt her stomach do that twisty thing. "We work together. There’s nothing…you know, no worries there. If you wanted to…" She trailed off, gesturing uselessly.</p><p>Carol eyed her again, amused. "I don’t date my patients," she said.</p><p>"Oh. Right, of course," Agatha nodded.</p><p>Carol shifted her weight, tilting her head. "But you’re not my patient."</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth. Nothing came out. She coughed, trying to force words back into her throat.</p><p>"I—me?" she finally managed.</p><p>Carol raised a brow, amused. "You make a compelling Morticia. And you seem…" she tilted her head. "<em>Interesting</em>."</p><p>Agatha’s pulse roared in her ears.</p><p>"I’m…flattered," she said, and she could feel the heat in her cheeks. "But I've never…I mean, I don’t….." She cleared her throat. "I don’t date women. I’m sorry."</p><p>"Do you want to?" Carol asked without missing a beat, and Agatha blinked. Before she could stop herself, her eyes flicked toward Rio’s door. Just for a second.</p><p>Just one second.</p><p>But when she glanced back, Carol’s eyes held a suspicious look of understanding, even though, <em> no, stop, </em>there was nothing here to understand.</p><p>"Ah," Carol said with a smile. "No worries. Hope it works out."</p><p>"Hope what…" Agatha felt weak, her pulse threadbare. Carol just smiled, gave her a polite nod, and brushed past.</p><p>Agatha all but gripped the wall as she walked to the waiting room. She sat heavily in a chair, the same chair she'd spent two hours in earlier that night. She felt feverish, her throat tight. This was all too much: Rio in the hospital, Agatha in her bed, being asked out twice in one day, once <em> by a woman</em>. </p><p>Before she could spiral any further, she pulled out her phone. </p><p>"Hey." Paul’s voice came over the phone, sleepy.</p><p>"Yes," Agatha said. </p><p>"What?" </p><p>"Yes, I will go to dinner with you. Next week. How’s Thursday?"</p><p>There was a beat of silence, and Agatha put her head in her hand for a second. What the <em> fuck </em> was she doing?</p><p>"Wow, okay. Yes. Thursday." Paul sounded utterly surprised, and Agatha tried not to feel bad for him.</p><p>"One more thing. Shop talk," Agatha said, massaging her temple. She tried to ignore the thought of Rio, alone in the hospital room, curled on her side. </p><p>"Shoot."</p><p>"I need an extension on my student teacher eval," Agatha sighed. "I know I’m already late, I just– I need more time. When is the <em> absolute </em> latest I can turn it in?"</p><p>"Well I just sent them out this morning. So, yesterday. But for you, end of the week."</p><p>"I promise I'll get it to you by Friday."</p><p>"Hold on," Paul interrupted. "I could have sworn I saw yours. Vidal, right?"</p><p>Agatha snorted. "Well that would be great, but no, I haven’t—" she stopped mid sentence. </p><p>Her stomach plummeted. </p><p>No. She <em>had</em>. She had filled out Rio’s eval, exactly once, a month ago. After three margaritas. </p><p>She'd closed her computer. She <em> knew </em> she had. Hadn’t she?</p><p>"Paul," she said, suddenly nauseous. "I need you to check, right fucking now."</p><p>"Okay. Give me a second." </p><p>Agatha waited, her knuckles turning white around the phone. The room was spinning.</p><p>"Yup, here it is. You submitted it in September. Wow; have you ever turned anything in that early?"</p><p>"Please tell me you forgot to send that one," she said, light-headed.</p><p>"Nope, got ‘em all," Paul replied,  cheerful and oblivious to the end of the world as Agatha knew it.</p><p>"Did you read it before you fucking sent it?" Agatha almost yelped.</p><p>"Of course, I read all of them!"</p><p>"Cut the bullshit!" Agatha yelled, frantic.</p><p>"Okay, okay," Paul said. "I may not have read all of them. Or any of them. It doesn’t really matter anyway, It’s not like I ever do anything with those evals except send them out for the student teachers to review. They barely have any implications unless someone is an actual disaster. I'm sure whatever you wrote was good enough."</p><p>"I have to go," Agatha said faintly. It was the second time she'd told him that today.</p><p>She needed to get out of here. She needed to throw her phone into the river. And then her laptop. And then her car, with her still in it.</p><p>She stood up, pacing. What exactly had she even written? Maybe it wasn’t that bad, right? She wracked her brain, willing the words back.</p><p>"Come on, come on," she muttered, tapping her phone in her palm, squeezing her eyes shut. "<em>Remember</em>." </p><p>She stopped short. Her eyes flew open. A sentence popped into her head. She sank to the carpeted floor of the waiting room, head in her hands, her legs giving out. She was absolutely, truly, <em> deeply </em> fucked.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p> </p>

<p> </p><blockquote>
<p>
<strong>“All of us invent ourselves. Some of us just have more imagination than others.” ― Cher</strong>
</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>The rain hadn’t let up since it started, exactly two minutes after Agatha had pulled out of the school parking lot this afternoon. She’d left her jacket and umbrella in Wanda’s office, somewhere between Wanda saying, <em> Are you sure you’re okay? </em>and Agatha snapping, <em> Why do you keep asking me that? </em>Her tone had been so sharp that Wanda had taken a half-step back in surprise. Then she laid a gentle hand on Agatha’s shoulder, and told her to skip the PTA meeting, just this once, and go home.</p><p>Now, she was sitting in her idling car in the pouring rain, one hour away from said home. The rain hammered her windshield, and she turned off her engine, cutting off Cher mid-verse. “After all that’s said and done,” then sudden silence. The water collected on the windows, obscuring the brownstone across the street into blurry red brick.</p><p>It had been five days at school without Rio. She'd been reporting them as sick days, but Agatha knew the truth, stomach knotting tighter with each passing morning.</p><p>The students had gone decidedly feral as a result of the disruption in their routine—kids were like little barometers that way. Especially children of divorce, or trauma, or separation, or all the other flavors of abandonment, who were all a little extra restless. </p><p>That was Nicky, now, too, Agatha realized with a start. He refused to listen to her instructions in class. He would take his shoes and socks off whenever he damn well felt like it, despite Agatha’s hundreds of attempts to have conversations with him at school, in the car, or at home.</p><p>Today, she’d finally cracked. Ellie and Luca were placing another card atop Rio’s shrine in the corner of the classroom, (you would think she fucking <em> died</em>), and Kara had asked her for the seventh time that day when Ms. V was coming back. And Agatha had said, in a voice that was not quite a yell but definitely louder than she meant it to be: “I don’t know, and asking me more times isn’t going to make her magically show up.”</p><p>Kara had sat sullenly in the corner for the rest of the day, and Agatha had apologized and tried her hardest to make it through the rest of the day without yelling at anyone else.</p><p>Wanda had only asked once if Agatha knew what Rio was sick with. Agatha had said, “Are you <em> sure </em> she said she was sick? Like, did she specifically say the word ‘sick?’” </p><p>Wanda had crossed her arms, looked at her shrewdly, and said: “Why would she say anything else?” </p><p>Agatha hadn’t even planned on coming here. One minute, she was in the school parking lot, staring down the barrel of the weekend. The next, she was stalled outside Rio’s apartment like a stalker. She would settle for seeing Rio’s face, and checking just how deep the anger ran in the lines around her mouth to see if any of this was salvageable.</p><p>She looked at the pathetic, grease-stained pastry bag on the passenger seat, and the coffee in the cupholder. Maybe she should have brought soup instead of gas station donuts, in the event that Rio really <em> was </em> bedridden.</p><p align="left">She squinted out of the blurred window, then down at her phone for the tenth time. Rio’s onboarding paperwork was still open—more specifically, her address, zoomed in so tight that ‘APARTMENT #3’ filled her entire screen. Because, of course, she'd also forgotten to wear her contacts. She thought of Cher, and what she didn’t say, and pushed the door open. </p><p align="left"> </p><hr/><p align="left"> </p><p>By the third press of the buzzer, Agatha's clothes were soaked through, and she'd come to conclusion that the button was broken.</p><p>The door swung open, and Agatha caught it with her shoulder as a man brushed past her. “It’s broken,” he shot in her direction. </p><p>It had been a while since she’d heard a Southie accent. Oyster Bend felt <em> impossibly </em> farther from Boston than one hour. His voice reminded her of her mother's wide vowels and sharp tone. She felt suddenly nostalgic, getting yelled at with lazy r’s as she ducked behind secondhand furniture.</p><p>“Tell her she needs to walk down the fuckin’ stairs to get her clients,” the man continued. “I don’t care if she’s in the middle of a fuckin’ seance, or summoning Bloody Mary, or whatevah.”</p><p>“Right, I’ll tell her.” Agatha almost smiled, and ducked inside.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Within a second of laying eyes on the third-floor apartment, Agatha realized exactly who the man had been referring to. A large, crudely painted sign hung on the door:</p><p>
<b>PSYCHIC READINGS, PALM READINGS, TAROT.</b>
</p><p>The smell of sage was thick, even in the hallway. Agatha hesitated, knuckles raised, fist still gripping the wet donut bag.</p><p>Before she could knock, the door opened. Agatha lowered her fist.</p><p>A woman stood there, draped in two colorful, clashing shawls, and the sage hit Agatha at full force. She opened her mouth to introduce herself, and sneezed three times.</p><p>"You must be the teacher," the woman said, eyeing Agatha with disdain.</p><p>"Wow, nice." </p><p>"Your shirt," she said vaguely, then turned, leaving the door open behind her. Agatha cursed, pulled her flannel tighter around her Oyster Bend t-shirt, and stepped inside.</p><p>“You must be Rio’s roommate,” Agatha called, taking in the camped living room through the haze of smoke. Beaded curtains hung in front of a door off the hallway, and Agatha heard a clattering—the kitchen, she assumed. Candles rested on every available surface, lit and unlit, some perched precariously next to newspapers and old magazines.</p><p>“Lilia,” the woman said, emerging with two cups of loose leaf tea that she couldn’t possibly have had time to brew in the thirty seconds since Agatha had come in. She set them down on the coffee table and sat expectantly on the velvet sofa. </p><p>"Agatha," she said, taking a seat opposite and extending a hand. "Nice to meet you."</p><p>"Can’t say the same," Lilia replied, sipping her tea. She glanced at Agatha’s outstretched palm.</p><p>“Right,” Agatha said after a beat. </p><p>“I can assume she’s not here, then?”</p><p>“Why should I tell you where she is, or isn’t?” Lilia said. “From what I hear, you tried to toss her to the wolves.”</p><p>“I didn’t—” Agatha gritted her teeth. “You know what—I don’t have to explain myself to you. I don’t even <em> know </em> you.”</p><p>“I’m finding that I feel similarly about you.” Lilia sat back. “I’ve heard the highlights, of course, but Rio left out some… <em> intriguing </em> details.”</p><p>Her gaze swept from Agatha’s wet hair to the coffee cup, then to the crumpled paper bag on the table. Agatha felt heat creep up her face at the scrutiny. She restrained herself from asking for immediate clarification, and took a sip of her tea instead, gagging at the taste as she swallowed. </p><p>“God, what is this?” She wiped at her mouth, wishing she could reach in and scrape the bitter taste off of her tongue.</p><p>“Moringa tea. An ancient remedy, known to cure hundreds of ailments.”</p><p>“It tastes ancient. No offense to its… magical powers.”</p><p>“The Tree of Life doesn’t care if you believe in it or not,” Lilia replied smoothly, sipping from her own floral teacup.</p><p><em> Tree of life. </em>Black ink flickered into Agatha's mind, the branches and leaves that curled along Rio’s ribcage.</p><p>Lilia’s eyes narrowed. “Yes,” she said.</p><p>Agatha shifted in her seat.</p><p>“Moringa. Native to India. Known as the Miracle Tree, or the Tree of Life,” Lilia continued. “It flowers year-round and thrives in almost any condition.”</p><p>Without warning, she reached into the paper bag and pulled out the single donut. She inspected it for half a second, then took a bite. A glob of jelly landed on her finger. </p><p>Agatha scoffed. “That was for—”</p><p>Lilia held up a hand, chewing.</p><p>“It’s <em>wet</em>,” she said. “What was the plan here? That you’d run through the rain, looking like a stray dog, all miserable and forlorn, and hand Rio a soggy donut? And then what? All would be forgiven?”</p><p>“No, of course not,” Agatha grumbled, and watched her take another bite. “And I’m not <em> forlorn</em>,” she added under her breath. She was still trying to figure out how she ended up in this smoky, messy apartment being scolded by a stranger. </p><p>Lilia finished chewing and licked the jelly off her finger. “She mentioned you drive her crazy,” she mused. “But I didn’t get the impression you were <em> stupid</em>.”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha snapped, bracing her hands on her thighs. “This has been a <em> delightful </em> waste of time, but if you’re not going to tell me where she is, I’m just going to keep leaving her voicemails until she picks up, and I'll tell her it was your idea.”</p><p>Lilia snorted, her face somewhere between amused and impressed.</p><p>“Why don’t you stay a while?” she said, pulling a deck of cards from her sleeve. She paused, looking Agatha in the eye. “Or, <em>I’ll </em> call Rio. And I’ll tell her that you showed up here, all wet from the rain like that man from that movie she showed me once. And that you brought donuts and coffee. On a <em> school day. </em>”</p><p>“Ryan Gosling,” Agatha snapped, arms tightly crossed. “And you don’t have a phone.” </p><p>“Ah, so you’ve seen it?” Lilia exclaimed. “Fantastic movie. And I see that you do have a phone, which I’m not above borrowing. By force.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed, trying to discern whether an old woman who believed in magic tea and thought <em>The Notebook </em> was an obscure indie film was going to muscle her to the ground.</p><p>Lilia tilted her head, considering her. “You don’t want to find out.”</p><p>Agatha stared, suddenly plagued by the uneasy feeling that she'd just spoken her own thoughts out loud without realizing it. At the very least, Lilia seemed crazy enough to actually <em> go for it</em>. Then Agatha would have to explain how she ended up in a physical altercation with an old woman. And, worse, why she was here in the first place.</p><p>She sat reluctantly, throwing her hair back over her shoulder with as much poise as she could manage. It wasn’t all that much, given that she was still wet.</p><p>“Three-card draw,” Lilia said, showing her the deck.</p><p>“I don’t believe in—”</p><p>“Three-card draw,” Lilia repeated. “The past, present, and future.”</p><p>She swept a pile of magazines and unlit candles to the side, laying out the first card in the center. Agatha looked at it, the image of the cartoon basking in the sun. <em> The Fool. </em></p><p>“Great. Thank you.”</p><p>“It’s not an insult. The Fool represents new beginnings. You’ve recently felt that new beginnings are behind you.”</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms, and Lilia drew the second card.</p><p>“Two of Swords<em>. </em> You are facing an incredibly important decision, one that splits the very essence of who you are.”</p><p>She flipped the third card. “Strength.”</p><p>“Oh, perfect. At least we can end on a positive note.”</p><p>“Strength,” Lilia repeated, more slowly this time. “You are on a journey to discover your strength, your inner courage, and…your power?” She paused, inspecting the cards.</p><p>“Is that a question?” Agatha said, and Lilia was silent. “Isn’t that kind of...<em>cliche</em>?”</p><p>Lilia was still looking at the spread in front of her. “Yes, it is,” she muttered, frowning.</p><p>Agatha gathered her things to stand, and something fluttered from the pile of clutter to the floor.</p><p>“Here,” Agatha said, tossing the stray card down on the table. “You dropped one.”</p><p>Why did you put it like that?” Lilia asked, pointing to it.</p><p>“Like what?”</p><p>“It’s sideways.”</p><p>“So?” Agatha huffed. She looked at it properly.</p><p>
<em> The Moon. </em>
</p><p>“Huh,” Lilia said, staring at the spread. “It was never a three-card draw. It’s four.”</p><p>“What difference does it make?” Agatha snapped, her frustration boiling over. She was thinking about the long drive home in rainy, rush-hour traffic, no closer to fixing things with Rio. She was thinking about Wanda’s face this afternoon, sharp and pointed, when she'd said, <em> “Why would she say anything else?”  </em>She was thinking of the stupid, terrible words she wrote two months ago that she'd never even believed.</p><p>She stood. “Thank you for the magic tea, and the fortune-telling. Keep the coffee, too. My treat. And don’t mention that I stopped by.”</p><p>“Sit,” Lilia said sharply.</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>“Sit,” she repeated, softer this time. “I’ll tell you where she is.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “Why?”</p><p>Lilia glanced at the cards, and Agatha followed her gaze.</p><p>“Oh, you’ve got to be fucking kidding. The <em> cards </em> told you to tell me where Rio is?”</p><p>“I did a tarot reading for Rio when she first moved in with me,” Lilia said evenly. “It was right around this time of year. She was seventeen.”</p><p>Agatha felt her chest tighten. <em> Seventeen. </em>She should have recognized it sooner—that look behind the eyes, the quiet embarrassment of being alone in the hospital, the guarded posture before Rio scanned a room. These were things Agatha <em> knew</em>. These were the things that came from being on your own before you were ready. </p><p>Lilia was watching her carefully.</p><p>“The first card I pulled for her was Death.”</p><p>“Dark,” Agatha said casually, but she didn’t move any closer to the door.</p><p>Lilia waved her hand. “Common misconception. It doesn’t always mean literal death. It’s a symbol of deep, transformative change.”</p><p>Agatha sat back down slowly, her palms pressing into the couch cushions. She frowned, doing the math. “But that was before her injury, wasn’t it?” </p><p>Lilia’s gaze had taken on a faraway look. “Yes.”</p><p>“Something about her parents?” Agatha said, remembering Rio’s quiet shake of her head in the hospital room.</p><p>“Not my story to tell,” Lilia said, but the way her mouth tightened said enough. “The important part is that I pulled Death for her for <em> ten </em> years. That kind of change isn’t easy, or fast.”</p><p>Lilia’s voice was heavy now, and Agatha saw the shine in her eyes. </p><p>“Some people never make it past that chasm,” Lilia said. “They never figure out a way to get to the other side, and they get stuck, or they fall right in. But some people build the bridge themselves, brick by excruciating brick.” Lilia leaned forward. “The last time I did a reading for her, I finally pulled her something new.”</p><p>She laid her ring-adorned index finger softly on the first card. </p><p>“Four cards. The first card is no longer the past—it’s now the protagonist of your draw.” </p><p>Agatha followed her finger, her heart thundering all of a sudden.</p><p>"The Fool,” Lilia said, affectionately, looking at the image of the person, irreverent and mid-skip. “The Fool is the first card in the tarot deck. Number zero. She is the beginning of the journey through the Major Arcana, characterized by divine madness and limitless potential.”</p><p>Lilia’s finger traced the edge of the card, almost lovingly, and met Agatha’s eye. “The Fool is reckless because, in a way, she is brand new. She has nothing more to lose. But that recklessness is fragile. She’s incredibly thick-skinned, but underneath, she is deceptively <em> soft-hearted</em>.”</p><p>“<em>She</em>,” Agatha murmured, her voice feeling hoarse all of a sudden. Lilia’s eyes softened as she continued.</p><p>“The second card is your body in the physical world.” </p><p>Agatha looked at the two swords piercing into a heart. A split decision.</p><p>“We can skip this one. I remember.” </p><p>“I’m sure you do,” Lilia said, not unkindly. “The third card, then, is the metaphysical. You have strength of mind, Agatha. Your courage and will are still with you. Which brings us to the fourth card—the future.”</p><p>“The Moon.” Agatha looked at Lilia, finding herself suddenly transfixed with the whole ordeal.</p><p>“The way a card is drawn is just as important as the card itself,” Lilia said. “Right side up means one thing, and reversed means another.”</p><p>“It’s sideways."</p><p>“The moon represents the subconscious—intuition, imagination, illusion. It’s characterized by dualities.” Lilia traced the drawing on the card, and Agatha leaned closer. “Here, you see a path. On one side, a dog, on the other, a wolf. The sun and moon, the two towers, rain and fair skies. The lobster rising from the sea.”</p><p>“A lobster,” Agatha repeated. “Okay. You lost me.”</p><p>“The <em> path </em> of the lobster,” Lilia said, pointing to the tiny red figure. There was an urgency in her voice that put Agatha on edge. “As it emerges from the ocean and forges down the path, the dualities present themselves. What it chooses is up to you—to whether you are willing to trust your intuition. Whether you can <em> hear </em> it when it shows itself to you.”</p><p>Agatha stood abruptly, jostling the coffee table with her knee. The remaining tea in her cup sloshed dangerously against the sides. </p><p>“Great,” she said shortly. “Now that we’re done with that—where's Rio?” </p><p>Lilia straightened, her gaze sharp. “I think you know the answer to that.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart sank. She'd been hoping she was wrong.</p><p>“You really shouldn’t go there,” Lilia said. And then added, “Again.”</p><p>Agatha felt her face heat in anger and humiliation, and she walked wordlessly to the door. </p><p>“I meant wearing <em>that." </em>Lilia gestured vaguely to the wet t-shirt and flannel. “Unless you want to advertise your place of work.”</p><p>Agatha cursed under her breath.</p><p>“Come with me." Lilia started down the dark, narrow hallway, and Agatha followed helplessly. She was going to end up in some hideous pink shawl, she knew it. They stopped in front of a room at the end of the hall, the door covered in collected signs. One read “Keep out.” Another: “Beware of dog.”</p><p>“This is Rio’s room, isn’t it?” Agatha bit back a laugh. </p><p>“Regrettably,” Lilia said dryly, "she has ignored my suggestions to redecorate since the age of seventeen. Wait here.”</p><p>Lilia slammed the door in her face, and emerged a few seconds later, flinging her a t-shirt.</p><p>“I’m not going to show up wearing Rio’s shirt,” Agatha scoffed. “I’ll just button up my flannel.”</p><p>“Oh, It’s just a white shirt, she'll never know. I know for a fact they keep that club over seventy-five degrees.” </p><p>“Are you a regular?” Agatha scoffed, swapping her shirt for Rio's. </p><p>“Of course,” Lilia shot back. “I give the women free palm readings, and Manny makes a mean margarita.” </p><p>Agatha crumpled the discarded shirts into a ball. Lilia was still standing in the hazy hallway, scrutinizing her. </p><p>“You shouldn’t be burning sage when Rio has asthma,” Agatha said finally, crossing her arms.</p><p>Lilia looked at her in surprise. “Impressive. Took me two years to get that one out of her. I open all the windows before she gets back.”</p><p>Agatha said nothing. Lilia’s quiet assurance grated at her.</p><p>“Good luck,” Lilia said suddenly, and Agatha turned toward the front door. This woman was <em> jarring</em>, but at least she sounded sincere.</p><p>“I don’t need luck,” she called over her shoulder. “And it’s the twenty-first century—get a damn cell phone.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>She needed more than luck. To walk into a strip club while it was still light out? She needed divine intervention. She needed a lamb, or a locust, or whatever the thing was supposed to be. She needed God Himself to descend from the heavens on a floating chariot and kick her in the ass.</p><p>God was nowhere to be found, so she settled for the rain. It was cold enough make her run, plastering her hair to her neck in the short distance. She caught her reflection in the dark windows, and it looked a little like she’d been washed ashore. She thought of the lobster under the moon, half in the water, claws raised toward land. </p><p>Maybe Lilia was full of shit. Maybe the lobster had never meant to walk the road at all. Maybe, in desperation, he'd decided to beach himself and die instead of choosing anything else at all.</p><p>Agatha felt the bass in her throat as she walked down the dark hallway. She waited for someone to look at her, to tell her she clearly didn’t belong here, and then to kick her out. Nobody did, so she sank into a booth, unsure if the roll in her gut was disappointment or relief. </p><p>“Can I get you anything?” The waitress snapped her gum and stifled a yawn. Agatha wondered how many hours she would have to spend here to feel anything close to boredom. She shook her head, and the woman looked at her.</p><p>“You gotta order something, honey.”</p><p>“Diet coke,” Agatha muttered, and then, before she could stop herself, added, “Actually, I’m looking for Lady Death.”</p><p>“Ooh, a fan.” The waitress winked. “She’s up next. Want me to tell her you’re waiting?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said quickly. “It’s fine, I’ll wait.”</p><p>Agatha wondered how exactly she was supposed to pass the time at a strip club, alone, with no tequila and no interest in spandex-clad strangers. Except for one, who wasn’t a stranger, and also wasn’t here.</p><p>She assessed the walls to give herself something to look at. The room felt laid bare, water damage in dark rings across the ceiling, a strip of silver duct tape patching a tear in a floor mat. She registered the shift in music to something slow and pulsing as her eyes wandered. One second, she was staring at a crack in the wall, tracing it across the room. The next, she was looking right at Rio. Agatha knew, instantly, that no amount of preparation would have made a difference. Rio wore green lace this time instead of black.</p><p>Lilia was right. What had she been thinking? Confronting <em> Rio </em> was one thing, but coming face to face with Lady Death was another thing entirely.</p><p>Rio stepped onto the small stage near the center of the room, and Agatha’s fingers tightened around her glass, her wet hair starting to warm at the back of her neck.</p><p>Rio glowed warmer under the green, her shoulders brushed with gold glitter instead of silver. The tattoo stretched across her midsection, black ink across every rib and muscle. Agatha couldn’t help but stare at the way it stretched and caught the light. <em> Miracle Tree, </em>she thought. <em>Thriving in almost any condition.</em></p><p>At first, Rio's movements were expected—the sway of hips, the half-lidded look of intrigue. Then, her face slipped, and her eyes fluttered shut. Agatha saw her movement shift. She felt the way it changed into something more fluid, more instinctive. She wasn’t performing anymore, at least not for anyone in the room. This wasn’t Lady Death—this was <em> Rio</em>. </p><p>She arched backward, one leg wrapped high around the pole. Her back bowed so far Agatha thought she might snap. Her hair spilled toward the floor, her chest rising and falling in slow, steady breaths as the lights flashed in colors over her skin.</p><p>Agatha couldn't look away. This wasn’t the Rio from that private room under the pink lights, hips moving against Agatha’s. This was nothing like the up-close, the teasing tip of her tongue in a practiced accidental swipe. This was something real. This was older. This was a thing that had lived in her body as it grew, freely given, and now lived inside a dark room for the eyes of the unqualified.</p><p>Rio’s pushed up slow from the floor until she was standing again. She bent one knee around metal, absently mouthing the words to the song. Her head tipped back, lips parted and face to the light, hair falling over her shoulders.</p><p>She was magnificent. Agatha’s throat constricted, guilt and awe and something deeper tangling tight and hot. She shifted in her seat as Rio opened her eyes, head tilting upright again. Her gaze landed immediately, directly, on Agatha.</p><p>The air left Agatha's lungs. The glass was warm in her hand as she watched Rio’s face turn from surprise to something searing, and then to cold, calculated detachment.</p><p>Agatha pushed herself to her feet, her legs carrying her with a mind of their own as Rio stepped off the stage and turned her back.</p><p>“Wait,” Agatha called, her voice sounding weak to even herself. Rio didn’t turn. Agatha kept going, weaving through tables and the growing crowd, bumping past a couple curious waiters until she was close enough to reach out and touch her.</p><p>“Rio,” she said again, firmly this time, Rio turned abruptly. Agatha stumbled.</p><p>“What are you doing here?” Rio said flatly.</p><p>"I want to talk to you."</p><p>“That’s not really what we <em> do </em> here.” Rio turned again, and Agatha followed. “If you wanted to <em> talk</em>,” she called over her shoulder, “you should have talked. Before you decided to try and ruin my fucking career.”</p><p>She faced Agatha again, her voice loud enough now that waiters were starting to turn and watch.</p><p>“Fight,” some drunk guy called to her right.</p><p>“Shut up,” she said in his general direction.</p><p>“No, wait." Rio grinned, her face still cold. “He’s right. You should show me what you’ve got.”</p><p>She took a step closer, laughing, and raised her voice. “Right, everyone?” </p><p>Cheers sounded around them, but Agatha was looking at Rio. Really looking at her. Her pupils were blown wide and unfocused, her chest rising and falling in uneven breaths. Rio was <em> drunk</em>.</p><p>Alarm bells blared in Agatha’s head, and she stood frozen, a crowd of belligerent men whistling and whooping around them. Rio wasn’t looking at her anymore. Her eyes were fixed just over Agatha’s shoulder. </p><p><em> Thick-skinned, but deceptively soft-hearted, </em> Agatha thought. </p><p>“Ten minutes. That’s all I want.”</p><p>Rio looked around, finally seeming to realize how many people had joined in on the craze.</p><p>“Fine. That’ll be one hundred dollars.”</p><p>“I thought it was fifty bucks for twenty minutes,” Agatha shot back. </p><p>“Aww, she remembered.” </p><p>Agatha fished the money out of her wallet. “I only have forty. What do I get, like, four minutes?”</p><p>Rio plucked the bills from her hand and folded them, tucking it into her bra. She took another step closer, and Agatha could see the hurt in her eyes plainly now. </p><p>“No,” Rio said quietly, and turned around. </p><p><em> No</em>, Agatha thought, and before she could stop herself, her hand shot out. She missed, her fingers encircling Rio's wrist. She felt the faint flutter of a pulse against her palm as Rio stumbled.</p><p>All of a sudden, there was an enormous man in a suit in front of Agatha.</p><p>“They don’t really like grabbing,” Rio said, glancing at Agatha’s hand. </p><p>Agatha let go reluctantly.</p><p>“What’s her deal?” the man asked Rio with a tilt of her head. “Am I throwing her out?”</p><p>Rio looked at her, and Agatha swallowed. She shook her head, the plea catching in her throat.</p><p>“It’s fine,” Rio mumbled at the man, and then beckoned Agatha with a small nod of her head. She didn’t look at her.</p><p>For a terrifying moment, Agatha thought they were going back to <em> that </em> room. But then Rio turned right instead of left, and they were inside a different one altogether. Agatha had never once considered that a strip club would have an administrative office. In the corner, a bottle of bourbon and and empty glass sat on a scratched metal desk. The light was harsh and fluorescent over their heads, the music muffled. </p><p>Rio leaned against the desk, her legs stretched slightly in front of her, and Agatha looked at her red, swollen knee.</p><p>“The doctor said you were supposed to take it easy."</p><p>Rio’s jaw tightened. “You have three minutes left.”</p><p>“Okay. I didn’t mean to submit it, Rio, I swear.” Agatha took a step closer, and the look on Rio’s face stopped her from taking another. </p><p>“I was drunk, and I was letting off some steam, and it was an accident.”</p><p>Rio was silent.</p><p>“That’s it?” she said, her hands gripping the desk behind her. “You <em> wrote </em> it, Agatha. You're fucking unbelievable."</p><p>“I know, but I…” Agatha shook her head. “I barely even remember what I—”</p><p>“Ms. Vidal’s effectiveness in the classroom,” Rio cut in, voice steady, “seems to stem more from charisma and novelty than any unique instructional ability.”</p><p>Agatha flinched, her gut twisting. Rio had <em>memorized </em> it. </p><p>“At the end of the day,” Rio continued, crossing the small space, “I have no evidence that my students are better off. It could be <em> anyone else </em> up there with me,” Rio continued. “And in my professional opinion—”</p><p>“Stop,” Agatha said weakly.</p><p>“In my <em> professional </em> opinion,” Rio said again, and this time her words slurred slightly. “It wouldn’t make the slightest difference.”</p><p>The club hummed faintly outside the door, a distant, pulsing beat. Then Rio exhaled, a short, brittle laugh.</p><p>“Is that your <em> professional </em> opinion, Agatha? There’s nothing fucking professional about any of this!”</p><p>She gestured around them.</p><p>“And trust me, I get it. You think this is the first time this has happened? You think you're the first person who's pulled this shit with me? You came in here like everyone else, looking for the fantasy I sold you. And now you’re realizing I’m a <em> real fucking person</em>, and you can't handle it. You fucking hate me for it.”</p><p>Agatha went still, her pulse in her throat. She had come here for <em> Rio </em> today, not for <em> Lady Death, </em>but Rio was looking at her like this had always been inevitable.</p><p>Then Rio moved. She grabbed Agatha’s wrists and yanked, pressing her hands to her bare waist.</p><p>“You paid me forty bucks, right? Take your four minutes. Do whatever you want.”</p><p>Agatha stiffened and tried to pull back, but Rio held firm. Her grip was too tight. She was holding her stare too steady. She was yelling at Agatha, but she wasn’t letting go. She didn’t want to cash in on her threat, Agatha realized, searching her face. She wanted to be wrong.</p><p>Agatha hesitated, throat dry. Then, she let the words tumble out, unpolished. </p><p>“You remind me of how I used to be, before. When I started teaching.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers twitched against Agatha’s.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, anchoring herself in Rio’s deep brown eyes.</p><p>“Specifically, the parts of me I actually liked. But…better.”</p><p>Agatha’s thumbs, still trapped under Rio’s, brushed absently against her skin. “That’s why I got drunk on a school night like a fucking idiot. I don’t know when it all got so hard. But <em> that </em>wasn’t about you. That was about me.”</p><p>Rio’s grip loosened a little.</p><p>“You’re the best student teacher I’ve ever seen,” Agatha said simply. “You're actually better than most full-time, tenured teachers, too. You have that <em>thing. </em>You make every kid feel so important, so easily. I don’t really know how to explain it, but it’s obvious to anyone with two fucking eyes. How good you are.”</p><p>Rio swallowed. Agatha pressed her thumbs into the soft space above Rio’s hip bones, wanting to pull her closer.</p><p>Rio exhaled shakily, and stepped back. Agatha’s hands fell to her sides.</p><p>“They made you cards,” she said, pulling the folded stack from her back pocket. She set them next to the bourbon.</p><p>“Nicky knows I took you to the hospital, so of course, Kara started a rumor that you broke your leg. You’ll have to clear that one up.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flickered to the cards. She traced the edges of the top one.</p><p>Agatha softened. “They need you back. And I... ” She paused. “I think you should extend to next semester.”</p><p>"No." Rio picked up the top card.</p><p>“You’re not even going to consider it?” Agatha said, anger rising hot in her gut. “Why not?”</p><p>Rio shook her head. “I’m done. At Oyster Bend, at least.”</p><p><em> With you. </em>She didn’t have to say it.</p><p>"Fine." Agatha threw her hands up. “I fucked up, I chased you all over this fucking city, and I delivered all the messages. Oh—Wanda says ‘feel better,’ by the way.”</p><p>She stepped back.</p><p>“Stay here, in this horrifying building with exposed wires and black mold. Work sixty hours a week<em>. </em> Breathe in all this<em>—”  </em>She snapped her mouth shut, shaking her head. “Whatever. Do whatever the fuck you want.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers tightened around the card, and she took a deep breath in, and then let it out. The exhaustion in her eyes made Agatha’s chest tighten. </p><p>“I’m tired of having this conversation,” Rio said, defeated. </p><p>Agatha wanted, suddenly, to step forward. To put her hands on her waist again, gently this time, of her own volition, and keep them there. No money exchanged, no ticking clock.</p><p>“So am I,” she said instead. </p><p>They stood there for a second, looking at each other, in the fluorescent office with the stained floor. Then Agatha turned, and walked out the door.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>It was dark now, and it was still raining. The heater blasted her with freezing air as she sat motionless in the driver’s seat. Rio was wrong, she knew that. But the thing was, Agatha couldn’t figure out exactly <em> how </em> she was wrong. She couldn’t point to a single piece of information with certainty and say, "That, right there—<em>that </em> is where you’re full of shit." She just felt it, irritating and unshakeable, like the rub of sand on wet skin.</p><p>Her music started up suddenly, and this time it was Elton John, not Cher. She closed her eyes, listening to “Rocket Man” in the parking lot of strip club, trying to feel the way she did when Nicky was in the backseat, singing all the words half-right. In fact, without his little voice over the song, she found herself suddenly hearing the words. She wondered if the song had always been this sad. She hummed along, and Elton told her it was going to be a long, long time. </p><p>She felt the prick of tears again, hot in her throat, and she pushed them away for the second time that day, or maybe the third. Rio was <em>done</em>, and Lilia had been right, somehow.</p><p>She tightened her grip on the wheel. If Rio was <em> done</em>, then she got to be <em> done</em>, too. Done with this nightmare of a semester, and done wondering every morning how her body and mind were going to betray her today.</p><p><em> Done</em>, she said to herself. The word drifted in her, touching the sides of her face, tracing her lips. It rolled down her neck and along the surfaces of the inside of her car, from the mirror and radio to the handle of the glove compartment, entirely unwilling to stick. </p><p>This was okay. <em>Done</em> was a good thing. </p><p>She tapped her fingers against the wheel and shifted in her seat, her clothes damp and itchy. The rain hammered on the glass, still, and Elton wailed on about the lonely, earthbound astronaut, lost in space since 1972. At the final chorus, Agatha, destined for land by a colorful piece of cardstock and a crazy woman, pulled out her phone. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>She drove straight to Paul’s house. She didn’t think twice—not when she realized that she didn’t know where Paul lived, and she had to text him after hanging up on him to <em> ask </em> for his address. Not even when she had to park on the next block and walk quickly past windows of families she probably knew.</p><p>She turned the volume on her thoughts all the way down, until she felt eerily calm, and let her feet carry her down the sidewalk. <em>First sign of crisis</em>, she thought vaguely. She didn’t stop, even after she was inside the door, pressing her lips to his without preamble, her hands moving on autopilot and her brain a little farther behind. </p><p>She didn’t stop until she was literally on top of him, bare-assed, knees braced on his stupid fucking navy bedsheets. She still hadn’t even bothered to take off her shirt. Rio’s shirt.</p><p>Her eyes were fixed on the wall, then squeezed shut as she moved, trying to remember how this was supposed to feel, trying to find that angle she <em> knew </em> existed. But it was in the same way she knew gravity existed—it was there because it <em> had </em> to be there, tugging at her, but really, nobody could say for certain. It was just theory.</p><p>She opened her eyes, and for a second she looked at Paul. He was spread out on his back, his eyes shut, his face slack with pleasure. Her legs were getting tired. </p><p>Her eyes fell to the blue alarm clock on the nightstand, tracing the edges of the shape, her hips still mindlessly moving. On the side of the plastic, she saw a tiny, painted crescent moon.</p><p>She stilled.</p><p>“Where did you get that?” she asked, staring at it.</p><p>“What?” Paul’s voice was breathy and unfocused.</p><p>“That clock—how long have you had that?”</p><p>Paul followed her gaze. “I don’t know. A couple years? Why?”</p><p>“No reason,” she muttered, resting her hands on her thighs. Fucking Lilia, inside her head at a time like this. She closed her eyes and shook her head to banish the thought.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she said finally, and scrubbed her hands over her face. “This fucking week.” </p><p>“I’m having a good time,” Paul said, sliding his hands to her hips. “And hey, I’m sorry about your student teacher, by the way.”</p><p>Agatha froze again, her eyes flying open.</p><p>“Sorry? About what?” she said. </p><p>“She didn’t tell you?” Paul’s eyes were shut, his voice distracted. </p><p>Agatha’s gut turned. “Tell me <em> what</em>?”</p><p>“She applied to extend, and I had to reject her.”</p><p>Her body lurched forward before she could stop it, her hands pressing against Paul’s chest as she leaned over him. Her breath was shallow. </p><p>“Wait, she <em> what</em>? You <em> what</em>?” </p><p>Agatha replayed the last few hours in her head. Rio’s stark refusal to try and her angry resignation felt suddenly different.</p><p>“Did you reject her because of my eval?” Agatha dug into his chest. </p><p>“What? No, of course not." Paul shifted underneath her. Agatha gritted her teeth, trying not to wince. </p><p>“I still haven’t read it. I was just getting pressure from some parents,” Paul said. "And it was getting impossible to deal with them, you know how they are.”</p><p>“What do you mean, <em> pressure</em>? What kind?” Agatha dug her nails in deeper.</p><p>“Ow,” he huffed. “It was anonymous, okay? Mostly. But some people aren’t thrilled about how outspoken she is. Or what their kids are coming home saying. She takes after you, I guess. She only has one more semester to go. I’m sure she’ll get placed somewhere else, no problem. It’s not worth the trouble to keep her here.”</p><p>He glanced down at Agatha’s motionless hips.</p><p>“The hell it isn’t,” Agatha growled, and god, she could not fucking believe he was actually inside her right now. What the fuck had she been thinking? She was going to kill Wanda for keeping this from her.</p><p>“By ‘outspoken,’” she said carefully, “you mean ‘gay,’ right? Just to be extremely fucking clear.”</p><p>“Whoa, god, of course not!”</p><p>“That’s what they meant, Paul. It’s not fucking rocket science.” She slapped him on the chest in frustration, and he yelled out a half-laugh, shielding himself. </p><p>An idea slipped into Agatha’s head, and she grabbed at it. She didn’t think, because why start now?</p><p>“Paul,” she said, softening her voice. She tightened around him, slow and deliberate, and his mouth fell open. “Let me make something <em> clear</em>.”</p><p>His hands flew back to her hips, and she noticed his throat bob with slight satisfaction.</p><p>“I don’t give a fuck how much those parents are bankrolling the school.” She leaned in. “If you don’t approve her extension, I’m getting up and walking out. Right fucking now.”</p><p>Paul let out a breathless laugh in disbelief. “You wouldn’t.”</p><p>Agatha pushed up, lifting herself just enough.</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>, okay, okay,” he gasped. His hands pulled at her hips. “Fine. But if shit hits the fan, it’s your mess, Agatha.”</p><p>“I’ll manage. And delete my evaluation. I’ll send a new one.”</p><p>Paul’s brow furrowed, his eyes still hazy. “Why do you care so much about this Vidal girl, anyway?” His thumbs pressed into her skin, and she suddenly wanted to slap his hands away. “What’s her name again? Ria?”</p><p>“<em>Rio</em>,” Agatha hissed.</p><p>She wasn’t prepared for the way the word felt in between her teeth, the syllables rolling on her tongue.</p><p>“She’s not a <em> girl."</em> Her hips tilted in an unconscious roll. “She’s a fucking woman.”</p><p>Her breath hitched. Heat curled up her spine at her own words, into her chest and across her cheeks. It came out of nowhere, familiar and unmistakable. Her eyes fluttered shut for a second, and she forced them back open. </p><p>“Right,” Paul said, almost incoherent, his eyes still locked on her hips.</p><p>“I care,” Agatha breathed, “because she’s good at her job. Better than I am, and she’s only been doing it for two fucking minutes.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Paul groaned, “I know you love to talk about work, but can we—”</p><p>“No," Agatha snapped. “No. You brought it up. And you were one lonely night away from firing the only thing holding my sanity together this year, so no. I’m not fucking done.”</p><p>Her hips rocked again, deeper this time, and <em> yes</em>, <em> this </em> was better. Maybe the problem had never been the angle of it all to begin with. </p><p>“She listens when people talk,” Agatha said, suddenly losing her breath. “She doesn’t do that annoying thing most people do where they just pretend.”</p><p>Her voice broke between words, and she moved faster now, her hips rising and falling with purpose. “And she’s actually kind of quiet unless she’s fucking yelling at me.”</p><p>Paul was panting, his annoyance utterly forgotten in the face of Agatha’s ruthless pace, mumbling something. She thought he said, “She’s hot, too.”</p><p>Her breath caught at that, sharp and involuntary. Something low and needy slipped from her throat before she could stop it.</p><p><em> No. No, Agatha. Stop, </em> she begged herself, silently. <em> Not this. </em>She squeezed her eyes shut, forced her breath to slow. She could still leave. </p><p>But she was already here. And she had already gone through all the trouble. And, god, she wanted <em>one</em> night where she could pretend everything was normal, where she could call someone she kind-of-sort-of knew for casual sex, and then actually enjoy it. Even if enjoying it meant getting herself off on whatever was fucking working. Which was definitely, certainly, obviously not <em>Paul</em>.</p><p>She pressed her nails into his ribs, grounding herself, her breath shaky.</p><p>"Stop talking," she said. Her eyes fell shut as she moved, clawing herself out of the ocean, inch by fucking inch. All she could hear was the catch of her own breath in her throat, her own ragged breathing, the wet slap of skin on skin. And all she could see was <em> Rio</em>.</p><p>Not Lady Death, smooth skin and lace. Not eyeshadow, or lipstick, or glitter. Not the fantasy she'd been sold for fifty dollars from her husband’s wallet. Instead, she saw the mundane. </p><p>She saw Rio in the mornings, legs stretched out under the desk, blinking the sleep from her eyes. Her arms stretched above her head, long and lean and real. Her fingers dancing along the edges of her sweatshirt strings, and her teeth around a plastic marker cap, and the set of her lips to the lid of a green travel mug. </p><p>It was Rio in plain, boring t-shirts, the soft cotton clinging to her, sleeves rolled haphazardly past her tanned shoulders into a muscle tank by mid-afternoon. And her tongue, her <em>tongue</em>, pushed into the side of her mouth.</p><p>Agatha was overwhelmed by the specificity and vividness of her thoughts, like they had been sitting there, waiting for her to call on them to spring front and center, one after another. Where she'd just moments ago been contemplating how to remove herself from this situation, she instead found herself suddenly rocketing towards an orgasm at a pace she couldn’t remember ever having neared.</p><p>“Oh, fuck,” Paul said. Agatha blinked her eyes open and clamped her hand over his mouth. </p><p>“Shut up,” she gasped. She kept her hand there, and hoped fervently that he took the motion as something sexy instead of what it was. She squeezed her eyes shut again. </p><p><em> Rio</em>, she thought. <em> Rio, Rio, Rio. </em></p><p>A moan tore from her lips, and she threw her head back as she rocked. This was that nagging threat in the back of her mind since the first day of school, pacing in Wanda’s office—this was the <em>catastrophe </em>waiting to happen. </p><p>She felt feverish, the sweat starting to collect at the back of her neck as she moved faster again, because as it turned out, she wanted it to happen. Her memories mixed with scenes she knew hadn’t happened, but could somehow see with baffling clarity: her hand on Rio’s leg, kneeling in front of her. Biting at the inside of her thigh, pulling sounds from her, her voice needy and unrestrained and at the mercy of <em>Agatha’s</em> tongue, for fucking once.</p><p>Rio’s t-shirt rubbed against her chest in an infuriating, incredible sort of way, and she pictured it as she moved, that it was <em> Rio </em> spread out underneath her. Rio wearing this damn white t-shirt, Agatha’s fingers inside her and thumb pressing against her in just the right spot. She reached a hand down, following her own helpless train of thought. Her fingers circled relentlessly, the desperation so visceral that her own hand felt uncoordinated.</p><p>She wanted it to be Rio under her touch. <em>Rio’s </em> back arching, <em> Rio’s </em> hands grasping at Agatha’s hips, nails digging into skin. Her chest pressed to Agatha’s. Her lips against Agatha’s ear, whimpering. Fucking <em>begging</em>.</p><p>That was all it took, that final thought. Agatha froze for a second, eyes screwed shut, and felt the heat slam into her. The sound that ripped from her throat was foreign to her own ears, every muscle in her body curling in searing pleasure. </p><p>She barely registered Paul and his sporadic movements as her body seized.</p><p>Her eyes were squeezed shut, still, and her brain was fried, everything coming at her too slow. She twitched with leftover spasms, and she didn’t know how long she sat there, hunched over, barely holding herself up until Paul’s hands fell from her hips. She felt the sweat start to cool on her back. </p><p>The sound of her own breath filled her ears. Too fast, too shallow, refusing to even out. She rolled off of him, and stood immediately on shaky legs. </p><p>“You getting out of here already?” Paul said, and she glanced at him as she pulled on her pants.</p><p>“Yeah.” She kept her voice steady, with monumental effort. “I have to, you know, go get groceries and stuff before I get Nicky tomorrow.”</p><p>She was spouting useless information now, and it wasn’t necessarily a lie, except that it definitely was, because she wasn’t going to be able to walk through a fucking grocery store right now. </p><p>“I had fun,” Paul said, and Agatha nodded, a polite smile on her lips.</p><p>“Me too.” She wasn’t <em> lying</em>, not technically. </p><p>“Call me if you ever want to, you know, do this again,” he said, and all she could manage was a nod before she slipped out the door. She found her flannel slung over the arm of his couch, pushing her arms through the damp sleeves. She'd never taken off Rio’s t-shirt.</p><p>Her stomach twisted with the images that had just wrecked her. They were still there, and still devastatingly detailed. <em> Rio </em> was still there, the static clear in a way it hadn’t been, the volume turned all the way up. </p><p>She only paused again when she reached her car, leaning back against the door.  It was silent except for her ragged breathing, on this suburban street after dinner time. She looked up at the orange streetlights, and then past them, her head tipped back against the car roof.</p><p>She felt the door against her back, and maybe gravity was holding her sideways, because who could say when it was all just theory? She stared at the sky, and the sky looked different. </p><p>Her chest tightened with an odd, strained kind of pressure. She thought about getting into her car and driving home, or maybe actually going to the grocery store. </p><p>The feeling crept up her throat, and erupted from her. It was a <em> laugh</em>, she realized. Once, and then again. Then she kept going, too loud on the silent street. It echoed against the parked cars in their double driveways, and bounced off of the mailboxes on trimmed lawns. It was all ridiculous and absurd: she'd shown up to fuck a man, and come undone at the imaginary hands of a woman.</p><p>She wiped at her face, her ribs aching from laughter, and maybe from something else, because she was crying, too. She stayed for another long while, laughing and crying. She breathed, and craned her neck, and wondered when exactly it had happened. Somewhere between Rocket Man taking flight and the lobster crawling out of the sea, the rain had finally stopped.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>On Monday morning, Agatha woke up to three notifications on her phone. Two voicemails, and an email. </p><p>The first voicemail was from Rio. </p><p>"Hey. I—uh, I hate leaving voicemails, but. Whatever. Okay."</p><p>A pause. The faint hum of sitcom laughter in the background. <em>Seinfeld</em>, Agatha guessed.</p><p>"Lilia told me you came by on Friday. Before… yeah. Sorry. I shouldn't have ghosted the kids for a week. Or you. I wasn’t exactly at my best. It’s a tough time of year for me. And the knee, and… yeah. I know you didn’t mean any of it. And I didn’t either. So—like, we’re fine. I hope?"</p><p>Agatha heard the rustling of fabric. Blankets, maybe.</p><p>"And Paul called me. I’m staying next semester, and I feel like you had something to do with that, so thank you."</p><p>Another pause. A door closing.</p><p>"Oh, and I won’t be there tomorrow—I have a follow-up appointment. A real one, this time. But I’ll be back Tuesday. You can tell Kara I broke my other leg, or something."</p><p>A quiet laugh. And then— </p><p>"Yeah, and um, listen. I’m sorry. I know this whole thing is fucking with your year. I know that you’re keeping this…kind of, like, huge secret for me. And I’m usually better at compartmentalizing. You know, separation of church and state, or whatever. But also, I’m not used to the stakes being this high. Like, with school. And my career. </p><p>Because, you know, we met before. And that makes it harder. I don’t know. You know?"</p><p>A pause. The wrinkling of plastic. </p><p>"But yeah. How about this. You can't show up at the club anymore, or take out your issues on my work. And in return, I'll cut back on some shifts, and I promise to be on time. And... I'll stop messing with you about the whole lap dance thing. I don't know, I feel like that’s a pretty good deal. Keeping it professional, you know?</p><p>Yeah. Anyway. Okay. See you Tuesday. Oh, this is Rio, by the way, I never said that. But you probably know that by now. Okay, bye. And check your email."</p><p> </p><p>The second voicemail was from Josh.</p><p>The second voicemail was shorter.</p><p> </p><p>"Hey… I think I just remembered something crazy, and there is no way… I better not be remembering this right, Agatha.</p><p>Call me, as soon as you fucking get this, because… just call me. <em>Jesus</em>.</p><p>Call me."</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>The third message was an email.</p><p>The third message was the shortest.</p><p>

<p>“There are no grades anymore, Greer. Sometimes I think you forget that. There are never going to be grades for the rest of your life, so you just have to do what you want to do. Forget about how it looks. Think about what it is.”</p>
<p>
<strong>― Meg Wolitzer,<em> The Female Persuasion </em></strong>
</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p> </p><p>On the twenty-first day of December, Agatha received a ceremonial certificate in the mail for the fifth time. First came her degree, then came marriage. Then the death of her mother, and the birth of her son after that. And now, the official dissolution of the second. </p><p>The pieces of paper that made up her life were stashed in a shoebox at the bottom of her closet, next to the passports and her mother’s stolen diamond earrings she'd never gotten around to selling. She'd left them there, until one year turned into three, and three into ten, and the certificates stuck together with old age.</p><p>She would have preferred an email. Or a notary with a penchant for theatrics, showing up at her door to collect her marriage and pack it neatly back into his briefcase. It was unnecessary—sending permanent proof of her mistake instead of just scratching it from the record. She would pay double if the Notary Collector wanted to rip it in half or burn it, right there on her doorstep.</p><p>But this was the fifth certificate, not the first. There was no email and no briefcased man on her stoop, and it was time to brush the tangled hair of a stubborn, sleepy boy. The end of her marriage was just another envelope in the mail, between the superstore coupons and the phone plan offerings addressed to the couple next door.</p><p>On the twenty-first day of December, which was a Thursday, Mrs. Agatha Harkness legally became a <em> Ms</em>. again. Although, she lost the ‘r’ the same day she lost her husband, five months ago in the nauseating heat of July. </p><p>It was December now, and she wasn't thinking about July. She was thinking about a certain kind of unexpected laugh and a plain white tee. Thinking about these things felt like the ground steaming under the first rain, or a warm leg pressed against hers on the sofa on a Sunday night. It felt like cracking the windows for the storm so the chimes could sing, the smell of petrichor and popcorn on the wind. </p><p>It was familiar and foreign all at once, invasive like the creeping thistle under her front steps waiting patiently for the first sign of thaw. But it was December, not July, and thistle didn’t bloom in the snow. </p><p>Agatha came back inside with the morning mail, her fingers red and numb. She tossed it on the counter, looked at it, and yawned. Then she turned around, and made herself some coffee.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>By two-fifty-four that afternoon, Agatha had her hand forearm-deep in a toilet, and she had all but forgotten about the mail. There were plenty of rewarding, life-changing things about working in education, but this was not one of them.</p><p>Ten minutes earlier, at two-fourteen, she'd stepped into the hallway and straight into the familiar, disorienting rhythm of holiday chaos. She'd glanced through the narrow window of her classroom door, where a collection of inappropriately expensive parent Christmas gifts sat on her desk. This year’s winner was a four-ounce bottle of hand-lotion, which she could only assume was brewed with the blood of an endangered species, since—according to her research—it rang up at seventy-two dollars and forty cents. She wanted desperately to sit at her desk with the door closed and rub expensive blood-lotion on her hands.</p><p>Winter Break was one day away, and the teachers looked appropriately manic, hanging out of doorways and yelling after students. The fourth grade teacher wore two pairs of glasses—one on his face, one on his head—as he waved a forgotten worksheet at a boy who was long gone.</p><p>Nicky had escaped her in the gaggle of her class, and she looked for him with her back against the wall to avoid the muddy spots. The hallway in December smelled like wet jacket and stale candy canes. She liked it, a little. It reminded her of almost-Christmas, the same way the smell of sun on pavement and juice boxes reminded her of almost-summer.</p><p>She ducked under a swinging backpack, catching it just before it hit the girl behind her.</p><p>“<em>Back-</em>pack,” she said to the kid, “not Air-pack. Put it on.”</p><p>She looked through the mass of moving bodies. Oliver was in the middle of a group of boys, shouting, “HO, HO, HO.” He'd been on a Santa kick today. Or, more likely, Agatha suspected, he'd discovered for the first time the grandiose satisfaction of a catchphrase.</p><p>She bent to pick up a muddy flyer under her foot that read: <em> Law &amp; Order: North Pole. </em>She crumpled it into a soggy ball.</p><p>“Sorry, Brynn,” she muttered. </p><p>Brynn, this year’s winter playwright, was a bright-eyed fifth grader and one of Agatha’s old students. She had an ambitious streak and a specific taste for procedural crime. To Agatha's delight, The PTA arts committee had largely overlooked the plot of the play, and she'd wondered why until she overheard Kristy in the bathroom one afternoon, hissing to a friend: “What if she wins an Oscar one day? We want to be thanked!”</p><p>When she’d first heard the title of the play, Agatha herself had wondered if Brynn really <em>should</em> be that familiar with <em> SVU </em> at age ten. Then, she realized <em>she </em> had watched the original seasons of <em> Law &amp; Order </em> when she was the same age.</p><p>She remembered Thursday nights in her cramped living room, her mother asleep too early, or gone entirely. Agatha would sit on the floor in front of the flickering TV her mother had rigged to their neighbor’s cable. Their neighbor, Norma, was eighty-five years old with thick, double-paned glasses. </p><p>“She can’t even see her goddamn TV,” Evanora had said. “What does she need cable for?”</p><p>So Agatha had absolved herself of guilt and watched the men on the screen. She rarely understood what they were talking about, but her body learned the rhythm of it. Her shoulders would soften, eyelids heavy. Her heartbeats would slow. The familiar “dun-dun” and horrific descriptions of violence would lull her into almost-sleep, until finally, she’d crawl onto the sofa and let her eyes shut.</p><p>Grown-up Agatha quickly found her way to empathy. If Olivia Benson had entered her life all the way back then with the borrowed cable on Thursday nights, Agatha probably would have written a play of her own. </p><p>She hadn’t actually seen the play yet. She knew Nicky was cast as a reindeer, but everything else he'd tried to explain to her had sounded like utter nonsense.</p><p>Her walkie-talkie crackled, and she closed her eyes, hoping fervently the call was for the other side of the school.</p><p>“Is anyone by the East Bathroom?” Jen’s staticky voice came through. “Happy?”</p><p>“Nope. Dealing with a snowball fight situation. But I think I saw Ms. Harkness over there.”</p><p>
<em> Damn it, Happy. </em>
</p><p>She scanned the crowd for Nicky one last time, and yanked the walkie from her belt loop. Maybe it would shatter if she squeezed it hard enough.</p><p>“Copy,” she sighed. “I got it.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>She'd gotten to the bathroom to find a first-grader jiggling the metal handle.</p><p>“It’s a flush issue,” she said into her walkie. Her boots stuck to the floor, and she hoped it was soap, but knew it probably was not. “Plumbing isn't my area of expertise.”</p><p>“Code yellow or brown?” Happy said. She held the walkie to her forehead.</p><p>“Yellow,” she enunciated, and the kid giggled behind her.</p><p>“Try flushing again. Sometimes they don’t press hard enough.”</p><p>“Your suggestion is <em> ‘try again </em>?’” She slammed the handle. </p><p>To her surprise and annoyance, the toilet flushed perfectly. She stared at it, then raised her walkie again. </p><p>“We’re good here.”</p><p>A sudden scream made her jump. She usually prided herself on being hard to startle, but she'd almost forgotten the kid was standing there. The walkie fell from her grasp, and landed, of course, straight in the toilet. </p><p>“F—" She caught herself and clamped her lips, staring at the bowl. She'd accidentally run over her last walkie-talkie in the parking lot, so Wanda had promised this one to her with the specific condition that she not destroy it. </p><p>She turned to the kid. “What happened?”</p><p>“Spider,” he said, pointing to the smallest living object Agatha had ever laid eyes on. Her brain thumbed automatically through the shelf of canned responses: ‘<em>It’s not going to hurt you,’ </em> or <em> ‘</em><em>He’s more scared of you than you are of him.’  </em></p><p>She took a breath and rolled up her sleeves. “You can go,” she said lightly, “unless you want to stay in here with me and the spider. I think it's a black widow.”</p><p>She tied up her hair, and the door slammed shut behind the boy. </p><p>Without hesitating—because hesitating just made her think about what she was about to do—she plunged her arm into the toilet, wiggling the plastic free from the hole it had somehow gotten stuck in. She pulled at it again, and couldn’t believe she'd done this enough times that she knew the best way to stick her arm down a toilet.</p><p><em> Only for you, Principal Max</em>, she thought dryly.</p><p>She freed it, finally, a few drops splattering onto her shirt. She held it over the bowl and watched the water drip. What was she supposed to do now—put it in rice? Take the batteries out? She decided on wrapping it in brown paper towels instead, then washed her hands, and thought about her mother. </p><p>When she was ten, it had been: <em> What does she need cable for? </em> And then, eight years later: <em> What do you need a degree for? </em></p><p>Agatha huffed out a laugh, and it echoed against the green-tiled walls. If her mother could see her now.</p><p>The wad of paper towels leaked through her fist. Maybe it wasn’t worth all the trouble, but she’d done it anyway. She took a deep breath, the sad brown package bundled in her fist, and pushed the door open to the noise.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>She finally spotted Nicky by the water fountain, wandering aimlessly.</p><p>“Hey, you,” she called.</p><p>He ran to her and jumped, landing at her feet.</p><p>“You know Daddy’s picking you up today, yeah?”</p><p>She rested a hand on his head. He nodded.</p><p>“And when will I see you next?” </p><p>“Tomorrow!” Nicky said. “At school and at the play.”</p><p>“And after that?”</p><p>She needed to make sure he knew. She hoped he did, because she wasn’t sure she could say it.</p><p>“Christmas,” he said, picking at a sticker on his sleeve.</p><p>“That’s right. Daddy’s going to bring you over on Christmas.”</p><p>“And we can still do Christmas movie night?</p><p>Agatha swallowed. Divorce may have been a simple matter of paperwork this morning, but this was something else entirely.</p><p>“You’re with Daddy on Christmas Eve,” she reminded him gently. “You can watch it with him. And maybe the next day we can do our own movie night, just you and me.”</p><p>It felt stupid even as she said it—a secondhand movie night, after the presents had already been opened and the mantle cleared, the chimney swept and china stacked away.</p><p>“Okay,” Nicky said, and that was it. He looked around for his friends, his attention lent to her and taken back far too quickly. Sometimes, when he lost interest in her grown-up ramblings and got bored of the information and the logic, she felt that she was just borrowing him. That she was always going to have to give him back—first to the hallway, then to Josh, and eventually to the unruly world.</p><p>He didn’t ask why, or cry. Just “Okay.” And Agatha knew, somehow, that <em>just-okay</em> was the worst of the three.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The hallway was still hot and unbearably loud. Agatha was halfway through separating two second-graders who'd braided their hair together when she saw Josh. He was scanning the crowd for Nicky, but his eyes caught hers instead.</p><p>She'd spent the last month dodging his calls and every effort to pull her aside, limiting their encounters to logistics. He'd dropped Nicky off for Thanksgiving and she'd practically slammed the door in his face. Now she was trapped, her hands tangled in little-kid hair, and Josh was walking towards her. </p><p>“You said we would talk about it before break,” he said. “It’s almost break. And I’m running out of ways to justify—”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha stopped him. “Not…<em> here</em>.” She nodded to the girls in between them, who were waiting patiently. “I'll meet you at the picnic table.” </p><p>“Don’t ditch me this time."</p><p>She watched him head toward her classroom. She looked down at the hair still knotted around her fingers, and tugged too hard.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Snow from last week’s storm still blanketed the ground. It was quiet, suddenly. Not all the way, because it was never <em> all-the-way </em> quiet at school, but her ears still rang with it. Josh was waiting under the maple tree by the picnic table as instructed. The tree was bare now, snow piled thick on its branches, and Agatha resolved to come out here more often. It was still her favorite place. She almost wished she’d told Josh to wait somewhere else.</p><p>“I’m here." She crossed her arms tightly over her chest.</p><p>“That’s your opening line?” Josh shook his head. “You hide this… <em> insane </em> thing from me for months, refuse to talk about it, and that’s all you’ve got?”</p><p>“What was I supposed to say?” she snapped. “<em>Hey, by the way—if I don’t let our—</em>” she dropped her voice—“ <em> summer stripper co-teach my class, the school board might fire me. And yeah, anyway, let me know when you get the divorce papers</em>?’”</p><p>Josh blinked. “They’re going to fire you?” </p><p>She hadn’t meant to say that part.</p><p>“Not if I play nice with Rio.”</p><p>“Right. Rio.” His mouth pressed into a straight line, and he grasped the lapels of his coat, knuckles white. “I’m not trying to be an asshole, okay? I’m sure she’s a good teacher, or whatever, but I just—I don’t get how you’re okay with this. It’s <em> insane</em>.”</p><p>“You said that already.”</p><p>“Because it’s true!”</p><p>His voice cut through the quiet, and Agatha held up a hand in warning, her eyes flicking toward the school.</p><p>“I <em>get</em> it. What now?”</p><p>Josh raked a hand through his hair. “You know what? If the positions were reversed, you’d be losing your fucking mind. You can’t deny that.”</p><p>She couldn’t. She hated that she couldn’t. That even now—<em>still</em>—he could look at the structural integrity of her arguments and point directly at the weak spots.</p><p>“What is it going to take for—”</p><p>She stopped abruptly, hearing the echo of Rio’s words from months ago, under a different kind of tree, paper instead of wood. </p><p>
<em> What is it going to take for you to get over it? </em>
</p><p>“If you forget about this,” she said instead, ‘I’ll owe you one. Please.”</p><p>Josh's eyes widened in surprise. She never promised him favors. And she didn’t say <em> please</em>.</p><p>“Nicky's birthday trip,” he said. "I want to come."</p><p>She hadn’t expected him to have an ask ready. Her first instinct was <em> blackmail</em>—before remembering she’d offered the favor in the first place. </p><p>“If I let you come,” Agatha said slowly, “you’ll drop this whole thing?” </p><p>Josh shrugged. “Yeah, fine. As long as she’s not fucking dropping her clothes at the front of the classroom.”</p><p>“<em>Jesus</em>, Josh.” She scoffed, looking away, and tried not to think about the fact that she'd practically said the same thing to Rio’s face on the first day of school.</p><p>The sweat was starting to freeze around her collar. Even with the volume and demands that waited behind the door, it was an easy answer, that she would rather be standing in there. Her body had known the heat of chaos since birth. Really, it was the cold quiet that set her teeth on edge.</p><p>“And I’m sorry. About Christmas,” Josh said, quieter now. “I know it’s not ideal. But you had him for Thanksgiving, and my family’s in town, and you know if—”</p><p>“Let’s just not.” She rubbed her arms and shook out her feet—one then the other. Her toes were numb, like her fingers had been this morning, and she thought of the envelope on her kitchen counter. </p><p>Josh reached for the door handle, then paused. </p><p>“This Rio thing,” he said. “You’re not, like…” He squinted, trailing off.</p><p>She stared at him, eyes starting to water in the wind, but she couldn't blink now. Of all the things she’d expected him to say, this hadn’t made the list. For fuck’s sake, just a few months ago the man had asked her if Rio worked at Olive Garden. </p><p>“I’m not what?” she said, even though she knew exactly what he meant.</p><p>“I don’t know.” He hesitated. “Is there something<em> going on </em> there?”</p><p>She felt a flicker of surprise that he’d actually asked. And then, immediately, something ached. </p><p>It wasn’t just what he said; it was <em> how.</em> It was the way they used to talk about people they saw at potlucks and weddings: "<em>Did you see Greg and Lola?</em>” and “<em>Do you think there was something going on?</em>” And there always was.</p><p>Josh had known her for half her life. She'd liked him, and loved him—though sometimes she could barely remember what that felt like. It was such a familiar, offhand delivery of such an astounding accusation. She missed <em>that</em>. Not so much <em> him</em>—as in Josh, the forty-three year-old with twenty year-old holey underwear and a knack for forgetting their anniversary—but the amount of space someone else had taken up in her for so long. </p><p>She missed the ease of having someone in front of her that could ask something big and terrifying, like they were simply asking for the time. Someone that could look under the porch steps, part the thistle thorns out of the way, and see the purple in its soft and simple glory.</p><p>And then it passed. She saw the space between them, the color gone gray, and the life reduced to a single piece of paper, then two. A once-overpowering certainty, turned to failure, and then to a warning that something good could only become something bad. That she would make this mistake all over again. How dare he see that, when no one else could? It was unnecessary, she thought. To stand at her back doorstep and present her with proof.</p><p>Her hands balled into fists. A stale, sour taste rose in her throat.</p><p>“Grow the fuck up,” she said, and walked past him through the door.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“Where are you going?” she heard Wanda call. </p><p>Agatha didn’t slow down. She'd spent enough time in this goddamn hallway today.</p><p>“To get a new shirt."</p><p>Wanda caught up, eyeing her. Her ponytail was coming loose, sleeves rolled up, and Agatha figured she probably looked just as disheveled herself.</p><p>Wanda handed Agatha a candy cane from her pocket. “I need Rio’s schedule for next semester. And I thought we could invite her to come to drinks tomorrow. You know where she is?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said, pocketing the candy. She was sick of candy canes and the sticky red dye that stained kids’ mouths and left red fingerprints all over her classroom. </p><p>Wanda fell into step beside her as they wove past a cluster of kids and started down the basement stairs. The air was colder, and Agatha rubbed her nose at a sudden swirl of dust under her feet.</p><p>“What do you mean <em> no</em>?” Wanda said. "You always know where she is.”</p><p>“No, I don’t. Go ask Brynn.”</p><p>“Okay, whoa." Wanda grabbed her arm, stopping her at the bottom of the stairs . “What’s up?”</p><p>Agatha paused, rubbing her hands over her face.</p><p>“Josh is coming to Disney.”</p><p>“You invited him?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said, pulling at her own hair a little. “I mean, kind of. Yes.”</p><p>Wanda narrowed her eyes. “I thought you said you would never invite him in—quote—‘a million fucking years.’”</p><p>“I know. It’s fine. It’ll be fine.”</p><p>“If you say so.”</p><p>Wanda didn’t let go of her arm. Agatha glanced down at her grip.</p><p>“I’ve been meaning to ask you,” Wanda said, glancing around the empty passageway. </p><p>Agatha felt suddenly uneasy.</p><p>“Have you seen Paul again?”</p><p>Agatha tried not to flinch at the question, but her forearm flexed automatically. </p><p>“Nope." She met Wanda’s eye. </p><p>Wanda hummed. “Okay, so…do you know why Paul rejected Rio’s extension, then changed his mind—oh, I don’t know—<em>one day </em> after you guys hooked up?”</p><p>Her voice was light, almost playful, but Agatha heard the edge underneath. </p><p>“It’s probably better if you don’t know the answer.”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes widened. She let go of Agatha’s arm. </p><p>“Did you <em> blackmail </em> him? With <em>sex</em>?” </p><p>“No, of course not,” Agatha hissed. Then she squinted at a spot on the wall, considering. “I mean… I guess a little bit. But not in, like, a premeditated way.”</p><p>“I thought you barely even liked Rio; now you’re trading sexual favors to <em> keep </em> her? What is <em>happening</em> with you?”</p><p>“I…there was an eval, and…Paul…Rio...” The guilt tugged at her as she took in Wanda’s incredulous expression. She should have told her sooner. She could tell her the whole thing now. She was already halfway there.</p><p>“It’s messy,” she said instead, and even that felt like a confession. </p><p>“I’ll tell you everything when I can, okay? I promise.”</p><p>She left Wanda there, open-mouthed and staring, and ducked into the auditorium. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Agatha shut the door to the costume room, wondering how long she'd have to stay in here before Wanda went home for the day. The tiny room smelled like old fabric and perfume, and Agatha barely registered the music playing before she turned. </p><p>Rio was hunched at the sewing machine, barefoot in socks, one leg curled beneath her. She'd stripped down to a black tank, her sweater draped on the back of her chair and her ponytail over her shoulder. </p><p>The soft whir of the machine filled the room, and Rio’s arm moved with the rhythm of it, precise and hypnotic. For a second, Agatha just watched. </p><p>Music floated from Rio’s phone speakers, classical guitar with a beat. Rio’s hands moved quickly, adjusting levers and notches on the machine whose functions Agatha had never seen nor considered. Her fingers pulled and shifted, pressed and curled.</p><p>Agatha’s sweater felt suddenly too hot again. It was this stifling room, she thought, as she watched Rio’s hands.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat. Rio looked up suddenly, blinking at her.</p><p>“Did I forget something?”</p><p>Her voice was rough with disuse, and Agatha wondered if she had been working here, hunched over a table, since she'd last seen her. </p><p>Agatha ducked through a rack, brushing aside a feather boa. “Wanda wanted to know if you could come to drinks tomorrow night. We usually go to Paolo’s at the end of the semester. But I’m here for a shirt.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “Sounds fun. But I can’t—I have plans.” She paused. “What happened to your shirt?”</p><p>“I had to fucking fist a toilet,” Agatha muttered, already rifling through capes and animal onesies. “Don’t ask.”</p><p>Rio hummed. “Sounds even more fun.”</p><p>“One more fucking day.” </p><p>Agatha yanked out the first thing that wasn’t kid-sized—a large white button-up—and mulled over Rio’s <em>plans</em>. She didn’t usually saywhen she meant work. Maybe it was a Friday night dentist appointment. Or another blockbuster rom-com with Lilia, passed off as an art movie. She ignored the obvious third option.</p><p>Rio looked up. “Not that one. That’s Brynn’s costume.”</p><p>“Of course it fucking is. Liv Benson wannabe.”</p><p>“Can you blame her?” Rio murmured, distracted again. Agatha hid her smile as she kept searching.</p><p>She pulled out the only other thing that would fit—a gaudy purple vest with giant, sequined flowers, two of them carefully placed.</p><p>Agatha glared at it. “Who bought a vest and thought, 'Sure, let me donate<em> flower tits </em>to the elementary school?'”</p><p>Rio smirked without looking up, and Agatha studied her. She was quiet now, in that way was sometimes, eyes red-rimmed.</p><p>Agatha turned around, pulled off her sweater in one fluid motion, and tugged the itchy vest over her head. When she turned back, Rio was still facing the machine, but her hands had gone still. Agatha smoothed the vest against her torso, trying to quell the flip of her stomach.</p><p>“What are you working on?” she asked, bracing her hands on the table next to Rio.</p><p>“I need to finish two more before tomorrow, or the snowman and the elephant go pantsless.”</p><p>“The <em> elephant</em>?” Agatha blinked. “What the <em> fuck </em> is this play about?”</p><p>“I’ve been told not to spoil it,” Rio said through a yawn. </p><p>She pushed back her chair and stretched her legs out. Agatha tried not to look at her arms laced behind her head, or the way her tank top rode up her waist, exposing a tiny sliver of skin. </p><p>“Wanda wants your spring schedule, by the way,” Agatha said, studying a loose thread on the table.</p><p>“I know,” Rio said. “I’m still waiting for my advisor to approve it.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, still looking at the thread.</p><p>“And when I do get that,” Rio added, “do I send it to Wanda? Or to <em> Paul</em>?”</p><p>Agatha looked up at the sudden edge in her tone. Rio was leaning back, arms crossed, biting the inside of her cheek.</p><p>Agatha straightened. She kept her face steady with excruciating effort. </p><p>“You send it to me,” she said evenly.</p><p>Rio just looked at her. “Must have been one hell of a conversation.”</p><p>“What was it you told me once?” Agatha said, her face feeling hot. “Was it ‘Let’s be professional,’ or ‘I don’t owe you all the dirty details?’”</p><p>Rio’s jaw ticked, and she turned slowly back around, hands falling on the sewing machine. They didn’t move.</p><p>“Sorry,” she said finally. She straightened the pant leg under the needle. “You’re right. It’s none of my business. I’m just really fucking exhausted.”</p><p>Agatha breathed out, resisting the urge to put her hands on Rio’s shoulders and dig her thumbs in until the tension melted under her palms.</p><p>“Maybe you should take a break,” she said instead. “With all your preexisting conditions? Your insurance can’t handle carpal tunnel, too.”</p><p>It got the soft snort she was hoping for, and Rio turned her head to look at Agatha, her chin still resting in her hand.</p><p>“How do you do this?” Rio asked, gesturing around the room. “It’s like, the best thing ever, until you’re doing seven things at once and your brain is about to fall out of your fucking eyes.”</p><p>Agatha smiled. She forgot sometimes that Rio really was new to this. </p><p>“You take breaks,” Agatha said. “You do things that make you forget where you are, even just for ten minutes.”</p><p>“What’s your go-to?” Rio said, yawning again.</p><p>“Bugles and Youtube,” Agatha said. </p><p>“What do you watch?”</p><p>Agatha tucked a loose hair behind her ear, avoiding Rio’s eye.</p><p>“That bad?” Rio said, eyebrows raised. </p><p>“It's not bad," Agatha started. “I watch videos of the world’s tallest roller coasters. Like, as if you’re going down them. There’s something about it.”</p><p>Rio was laughing, but Agatha didn’t mind so much.</p><p>“What about you?” Agatha said. “I’ve never actually seen you take a break.”</p><p>Rio looked at her, smile fading a little. She pushed her chair back, and stood. For a second, Agatha thought she was leaving. Then, she stepped closer.</p><p>“Do you know Bachata?” </p><p>Agatha shook her head. She didn’t know what was happening, but she knew that look. Rio held her palm up, and Agatha stared at it.</p><p>“No way. Rio.”</p><p>“You asked what I did to forget where I am,” she said quietly. “This is it.”</p><p>Slowly, Agatha relented, placing her hand in Rio’s.</p><p>Her hand was calloused and warm, and Agatha felt her throat tighten. They hadn’t even moved yet, but there was something so painfully intimate about silence with her hand in someone else’s. She missed that, too, right alongside the gossip and the rightful accusations. </p><p>She suddenly wished she'd made time to put on the expensive, illegal lotion that sat on her desk, just down the hall. Rio stepped forward, and she forgot about the lotion, and her desk, and the hallway altogether. Rio held her hand under the yellow light. The music was soft and the sewing machine silent. </p><p>Agatha’s pulse was racing, her hands suddenly clammy. She had spent the last several weeks avoiding a situation exactly like this, and here she was, hand in Rio’s. It hadn’t been lost on her that in the last month, Rio’s proximity had gone from something mildly distracting to something that made her lose her fine motor control and ability to string together any two thoughts.</p><p>She'd kept her solidly at arm’s length, but now, Rio was right up close, and Agatha realized that maybe she hadn’t been keeping her at arms length at all, and that maybe Rio had just been standing there.</p><p>“Bachata,” Rio said, “originated in the Dominican Republic, in the countryside and brothels.”</p><p>She took another step closer, and Agatha refused to step back, their toes almost touching.</p><p>“The people who lived in places that were forgotten about or forbidden had to create their own sense of physical freedom.” </p><p>Agatha swallowed, drawn into her words. She imagined couples on the hillside and inside the dark walls of the brothels, dancing through the night under the stars, or in the moonlight that shone through the cracks in the walls.</p><p>“It’s a simple four-step. <em> One-two-three, tap</em>. Like this,” Rio said, and stepped forward again. Agatha stepped forward at the same time, and Rio paused.</p><p>“Are you <em> leading</em>?”</p><p>Agatha glared. “Men never know how to dance. I learned to lead so I wouldn’t get left standing on the fucking floor all night.”</p><p>Agatha caught a flash of amusement in Rio’s eyes, and then the edge in her gaze as it flitted down to her lips. Agatha swallowed, her mouth suddenly dry.</p><p>“Lucky for you,” Rio said, “I’m not a man.”</p><p>She spread her palm and wrapped her free hand around Agatha’s waist.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught in her throat, as if Rio’s hand had pulled it straight from her, thumb brushing her ribcage. She’d been imagining Rio like this for weeks—her hands on Agatha, voice low in the dim light.</p><p>Since that night with Paul, her skillful imagination had finally come alive in the dark quiet of her own empty house. She'd become familiar with the new, hungry want of her body, and the resulting cries, half in ecstasy and half in anguish that it was all at her own hands instead of Rio’s. And then she'd come to school every day, a mix of quiet thrill and guilt she was sure could show on her face, as Rio kept to her quiet, infuriating promise of professionalism. The irony was wet-hot and filthy.</p><p>“Start with this side,” Rio murmured, close enough that Agatha felt the warmth of her breath on her cheek. “One, two, three—then a tap.”</p><p>Agatha focused on the feel of Rio’s hand at her back, guiding her, the gentle press of fingertips just above her waistband. </p><p>“Good,” Rio said, quiet. “Again.” </p><p>
<em> One, two, three—tap. </em>
</p><p>The steps were small, confined to a small square, just enough to shift their weight, to feel the push and pull of their hips. Agatha kept her eyes down, watching the pattern of Rio’s socks against the linoleum. </p><p>“Stop looking at your feet,” Rio said, her hand falling to Agatha’s hip. “Just feel the rhythm.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled and she closed her eyes. She let go of the tension in her shoulders and followed the pull of Rio’s arms. She felt the palm pressing into the small of her back, and her hips pressed forward in response. </p><p>“You’re doing great,” Rio murmured. Agatha felt her voice vibrate against her jaw, and heat crept up her neck at the compliment. She scoffed quietly, clutching the remnants of her pride while trying to stay upright. </p><p>“This isn’t that hard,” she managed.</p><p>“Good,” Rio said. And then she smiled, small and wicked, and rolled her hips in one deliberate motion. She slotted her knee between Agatha’s with devastating precision, and her head tilted back before rolling back up to the beat.</p><p>Agatha’s hands flew to Rio’s hips on instinct, using every ounce of willpower not to let the noise escape her throat where it was waiting. Suddenly, they weren’t in this dim, yellow, stuffy room. They were somewhere else—a supply closet with paper clips in her hair, or a hospital bed with the TV on, or a rug under a paper mache tree.</p><p>Rio’s thumb brushed under the hem of Agatha’s borrowed vest. It was getting harder to breathe with every brush of Rio’s hips against hers. She looked at Rio’s mouth. It would be <em> too easy</em>, she thought, to just lean forward an inch. To set her teeth to the side of her bottom lip. </p><p>She moved her hand back up, resting in the bend where Rio’s neck met her shoulder, and brushed a thumb against her throat. </p><p>
<em> One, two, three– </em>
</p><p>She felt Rio swallow beneath it, and felt the flutter of her pulse. </p><p>
<em> No tap. </em>
</p><p>“You missed a step,” Agatha murmured, pressing her thumb down, just for a second.</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched. Her hand tightened around Agatha’s hip.</p><p>Agatha had meant it to be cheeky—and fine, maybe a little flirty—but Rio glanced down at their feet, and something in her face shifted. </p><p>Agatha spent almost eight hours a day with her. She knew her face well enough by now, even the expressions that formed the slightest cracks in her usual cool. It was to be expected, she knew, with someone who took up so much space in her day. Even if it was just her day, not her life. Although, maybe those were the same thing.</p><p>Rio wasn’t amused, or annoyed. She was <em> surprised</em>.</p><p>She went rigid beneath Agatha’s hands.</p><p>“I didn’t mean…” Agatha said, her voice softening. “It’s okay. I was kidding.”</p><p>A loud click echoed through the room.</p><p>The door.</p><p>They reacted at the same time. Agatha stepped back blindly, her back hitting the costume rack. It clattered, rolling to the side of the room. Rio turned, both hands braced on the table, on either side of the sewing machine.</p><p>Jen was standing in the now open doorway. Agatha busied herself with the sleeve of a costume within arm’s reach. Her heart was still thundering, sequins scratching at her collarbone. She tried to steady her breath. </p><p>“Hey,” Jen said slowly.</p><p>Agatha didn’t look at her, still inspecting the sleeve.</p><p>“Hey."</p><p>The guitar still strummed softly in the background.</p><p>“Sorry." Jen crossed her arms. She didn’t sound sorry in the slightest. “Did I interrupt something?” </p><p>“No–” Agatha and Rio spoke at the same time, then stopped. Rio ran a hand through her hair.</p><p>“No,” Agatha said again, gesturing at her vest. “I had to get a new shirt because of the toilet thing earlier—you remember.”</p><p>“Uh huh,” Jen said, glancing down at the vest. She looked at Rio.</p><p>“Working on costumes,” Rio said. “For tomorrow.”</p><p>Jen looked back at Agatha.</p><p>“Custodial will be here in twenty,” she said finally. “They haven’t been able to get this room all week and it’s starting to feel a little stuffy.”</p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate. She grabbed her bag by the chair, flinging her shirt over her elbow, and yanked the pairs of costume pants from the table.</p><p>“I’ll finish these at home." She didn’t look at Agatha, and brushed past Jen. </p><p>Agatha grabbed her sweater from the floor and moved to follow, but Jen stepped into her path. She reached behind her and shut the door.</p><p>“Really?” Agatha said. “Are you going all ‘serious boss’ on me for stealing a shirt?”</p><p>“I <em> am </em> your boss. And that’s obviously not what I’m concerned about.”</p><p>“<em>Concerned</em>,” Agatha lilted. “You know I love that word.”</p><p>“Okay—what's another word for what I just saw?” </p><p>Agatha took a step back. “I don’t know, J—what exactly do you think you saw? Nothing happened.” </p><p>“You’ve known me since I was seven. Have you <em> ever </em> known me to misread a room?”</p><p>Agatha felt the guilt rise in her throat. She was silent. </p><p>“How long has…<em> that </em> been going on?” Jen hissed. “And when were you going to fucking tell me and Wanda? Does she know?”</p><p>“Nothing is <em>going on</em>!” Agatha said, her arms flailing. She took a deep breath, stepping forward. “You know me. You know I would never put your job, or Wanda’s, or Rio’s—or <em> anyone’s </em>at risk.”</p><p>“Except your own,” Jen said, exasperated. “It’s like you don’t give a fuck what happens to you! Do you have any idea what it’s like to do damage control for Agatha Harkness? Have you thought about what a tabloid scandal like this would do to <em> you</em>?”</p><p>“<em>Of course </em> I fucking have!” </p><p>The words burst out of her, breaking lightly on the end. </p><p>Jen’s eyes widened, and Agatha realized what she had unwillingly said. </p><p>She turned her back to Jen, putting some distance between them, and pressed her palms against her cheeks to cool her face.</p><p>When she turned around, Jen’s gaze was softer, and sadder, and something closer to disappointment.</p><p><em> No</em>, Agatha wanted to say. <em> You’re wrong</em>. </p><p>But she wasn’t. Not really. </p><p>“I can’t believe I have to say this to you." Jen shook her head. “But in case no one has—she’s your student teacher.”</p><p>Agatha scratched at her eyebrow, the humiliation spreading in her chest. She was being scolded by someone she still looked at and saw with pigtails. A little girl she had once walked to the bathroom by the hand because she was too scared to go by herself.  Sometimes she forgot that she'd given Jen back to the world, too. It was an embarrassing, reckless thing to forget.</p><p>Agatha stepped around her, and paused with her hand on the knob. Jen’s eyes were still wide with worry. Agatha wanted to hold her hand, and walk her to the car. She pulled the door open, and walked herself instead.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>On the twenty-second day of December, Agatha stood at the back of a dark auditorium, biting the cuticle around her fingernail. Intermission was over, the plot was incomprehensible, and it was impossible to see into the wings from this far back unless someone knew the exact four-inch spot to look. It was one sliver of view between the back right wing and the last half-curtain, where the architect had miscalculated the line of sight from just inside the doorway.</p><p>Agatha had spent more time in these loud, muddy halls than in the award-winning interior design of her own home, curated twenty years ago by yet another career man on her doorstep. He’d carried a messenger bag, which was just another kind of briefcase. He’d plucked the check from Josh’s hands, pointed out the eyesores in her empty living room, and said something stupid and meaningless like, "A beautiful house is only beautiful if people know where to look." And Agatha, twenty-two and late for school, had handed over the keys to her brand new castle.</p><p>But here, five certificates later, in the auditorium that always smelled faintly of nervous sweat and concession popcorn, Agatha had always known where to look. It was the last day of the first half of the year, six months to the day after she first laid eyes, but not hands, on Lady Death. And here she was, still, looking at Rio across a dark room. </p><p>On stage, Agatha counted: four snowmen, a tree, three lawyers and/or detectives—including Brynn—an elephant, and a judge dressed as Santa. Nicky had explained three separate times when his big entrance was going to be, but Agatha couldn’t understand the flow of dialogue enough to get an idea of when that was. She’d meant to look at the script yesterday, but after storming out on Jen, speeding to the store in a panicked haze, and forgetting half her list, she’d barely remembered to get Nicky’s costume. </p><p>Her two remaining options had been to ask Brynn, or Rio. Brynn had shown up to school with vanilla milk in a coffee cup, looking like she'd stayed up all night, and Rio had managed to be busy with something every time Agatha tried to catch her eye. </p><p>She was squinting at a singing snowman, trying to remember his name. She had just remembered that he was a nose-picker, and finally landed on the first letter D, when the door cracked open behind her. Alice’s head poked through, and she beckoned Agatha into the hallway.</p><p>Agatha glared, and followed.</p><p>“What? My kid’s almost on,” she said, and then added, “I think.”</p><p>Alice shrugged. “Rio told me to get you.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. If Rio hadn’t even had time to text her, something might actually be wrong.</p><p>“Okay, just—” Agatha fished her phone out of her pocket and handed it to Alice. “If Nicky comes on, start recording, and don’t stop until the end.”</p><p>Alice looked at the phone in her head, and then nodded. “Okay.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha said genuinely, feeling that same affection for Alice and her straightforward demeanor. </p><p>She walked quickly around the side of the building, entering the hallway backstage. Children wandered in animal costumes, volunteers shushing kids that got too loud.</p><p>“Where’s Ms. V?” she asked to the general crowd, and one girl dressed as the devil pointed down the hallway. </p><p>Agatha did a double-take at the pink pitchfork, and then reminded herself that there was neither time nor good reason to find plot holes in a play written by a fifth grader.</p><p>She found the music room empty except for Rio and Nicky. </p><p>“What’s wrong?” she said immediately, her eyes scanning Nicky as she sped to them.</p><p>“He's fine,” Rio said around the safety pin in her mouth. She was holding the elastic on Nicky’s pants, folding it in the right places. </p><p>“Hi, baby,” Agatha said to Nicky, worry giving way to sweet excitement. She could see the thrill in his eyes and his fidgeting fingers. He got that from her.</p><p>"Hi Mama." He waved at her, mouth a wide grin.</p><p>Agatha eyed the pants. “Oh. They don’t fit?”</p><p>“Where did you get them?” Rio muttered. “The elastic is like a piece of spaghetti.”</p><p>“They were five bucks,” Agatha said, indignant. “How many more times is he going to dress up like a reindeer before he shoots up three inches?”</p><p>“It’s fine,” Rio said, still working the elastic around the waist. “That’s not what I needed help with.”</p><p>She pinned one side in place, and placed a hand on Nicky’s shoulder. “Give us a second, okay?”</p><p>Nicky nodded, and Rio pulled Agatha to the far corner of the room. </p><p>“I’m sure you’ve heard about Nicky’s reindeer scene with Luca?”</p><p>“Vaguely,” Agatha said. “Do I need to know the details?”</p><p>“No,” Rio said. “Just that they have this cute little dance number we’ve been working on, and it’s in, like, six minutes, and Luca has locked himself in the instrument closet and won’t come out.”</p><p>Agatha pointed to a closed door on the other side of the room, and Rio nodded. </p><p>“Do we know why?” Agatha whispered.</p><p>“I haven’t had time to talk to him,” Rio said. “I tried, but I have to—” she gestured to the hallway, and in Nicky’s general direction.</p><p>Agatha recognized the pressure of a product. She watched the way Rio pushed the hair out of her face, a hand lingering on her forehead. It was a kind of stress Agatha hadn’t seen in Rio yet, not even when she was dancing on a stage by herself. Agatha supposed this auditorium had been her own stage much longer than it had been Rio's. She put a hand on her arm. </p><p>“Six minutes is enough. You take care of the pants, I’ll get Luca.”</p><p>Rio nodded, relief evident on her face, and returned to Nicky.</p><p>Agatha pressed her ear against the closet door. She heard faint shuffling and quiet sniffles. </p><p>“Luca?” she said softly. “This is Ms. Harkness. You doing okay in there?”</p><p>Luca didn’t answer, and Agatha heard more sniffling.</p><p>“You know, if you were a little nervous about the dance,” Agatha said, “that would make sense.”</p><p>More silence.</p><p>“But Ms. V said that you and Nicky have been working on it for a whole week. I’m excited to see it.”</p><p>“They were laughing at me.”</p><p>She heard Luca’s watery voice through the door. She locked eyes with Rio.</p><p><em> Who</em>, she wanted to ask, but her eyes flitted to the clock. Five minutes.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she said instead. “Can you come out so we can talk about it?”</p><p>“No. I’m staying in here,” Luca said, louder.</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha said. She pressed her ear to the door again. “Okay. Tell me what happened.”</p><p>“Jeremy was making fun of me when I was practicing my dance,” Luca said, still sniffing, “and then he said that his mom said he wasn’t allowed to play with me.”</p><p>Agatha leaned her forehead against the wood for a second. When she turned her head, Rio had paused, looking at her.</p><p>“Luca,” she said. She was surprised at how even her voice was, despite the steady hum of anger starting to spread. “That was not a kind thing for him—or his <em>mother</em>—to say.”</p><p>Agatha knew the unspoken rule never to trash talk a parent to a child. But she had four minutes left, and Nicky was listening, and fuck if she had any patience left for subtlety.</p><p>“He said it was because I like a boy,” Luca said.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes. Her chest felt tight, and she couldn’t keep looking at the clock. She couldn’t make someone see themselves in three minutes when it had taken <em> her </em> forty-two years. She looked at Rio, her hands clutching Nicky’s shoulders too tightly. Nicky was biting his fingernail, and Agatha felt a sudden wave of guilt that he had gotten that from her, too.</p><p>Agatha lowered herself to the floor and leaned against the door.</p><p>“Maybe it is,” she said softly, pressing her hand against the wood, palm flat. It was a useless motion, but she felt the need to do it anyway.“That doesn’t mean it was okay, or right."</p><p>She looked at Rio, and her eyes lingered on the curve of her cheekbones, the softness of her gaze, the eyelashes that had fluttered against her cheek just yesterday afternoon. She felt the sharp poke of fear in her chest, like thistle thorns under her porch.</p><p>Yesterday, she’d stood outside and looked at the man she used to love, and hated him for seeing her. And then she’d missed him for the same reason. Maybe that’s where she'd gone wrong. Maybe she'd waited, all those years as the thistle grew thicker, for someone to figure out how to move it out of the way without scratches and blood. She’d waited for a man to show up on her porch with hedge clippers, and start the tedious, painful task of clearing the weeds, when really, they'd always been hers to part and pull.</p><p>“When you like someone,” she said softly, her fingers pressing tighter against the wood. “That’s a good thing. That’s a beautiful, secret, magical thing—that you get to see all the best parts of someone else. And I know that it can be so <em>scary</em> to let other people see that most magical version of you.”</p><p>She looked at Rio. Rio was looking at a spot on the wall.</p><p>“Remember yesterday when Ms. V read <em> Stellaluna </em>?” Agatha said, and Rio finally looked at her.</p><p>Luca’s voice was small through the door.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“For so long,” Agatha said, “she thought she was a bird. And she tried so hard to be a good one. But then she learned she was a bat. And even though things were a little scary for a little while, she saw a world in a way no one else did."</p><p>Agatha looked back at the door, speaking quickly now. “People might laugh at you, because they don’t understand, and that might feel really <em>crappy</em>. The best way to tell them they’re wrong is to do your reindeer dance. That’s what we want to see, Luca. <em> Just you, </em> the way you are right now.”</p><p>Agatha held her breath. She didn’t hear sniffling anymore.</p><p>Rio was glancing at the clock. One minute.</p><p>Agatha stood, rolled up her sleeves, and took Nicky’s hand.</p><p>“I’m going to go out there with Nicky, until you’re ready to join us. You can stay in there if that’s what you want.”</p><p>"Bye, Luca," Nicky called, and Agatha's heart clenched. How she loved this boy.</p><p>She winked at Nicky, and called back to the door, “Luca, just so you know—I’m a really, <em> really </em> terrible dancer. I might accidentally do the whole dance backwards.” </p><p>Nicky giggled, and gripped her hand tighter. Agatha grabbed the spare reindeer headband Rio held out. She didn’t look at her face. She hadn’t laid eyes on a single line of script, and she was about to fake choreography to a song she’d never even heard, dressed like a reindeer. To make a fool out of herself in front of a crowd, for the third time this year.</p><p>But this time was different. It was the coffee after the mail hit the counter, or the quick plunge of a fist to save a walkie. It didn’t need a second thought, or even a first.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The kids had spent five minutes giggling at the sight of Agatha trying—and failing—to copy Nicky’s dance moves. Mic-less and improvising wildly, she made faces at the kids each time she turned around. Even Brynn was laughing in between feeding Agatha her lines, ever the consummate professional.</p><p>For a few minutes, in the chaos of high-pitched laughter and hole-punched snow, she let herself forget. She forgot all of the rules, the people watching, the door to the costume room slamming shut behind her yesterday. </p><p>She spotted Rio in the wings. Luca stood beside her, grinning in his costume. Agatha high-fived him as she passed, and then walked right by Rio to thunderous applause. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>It was almost nine by the time the parking lot had emptied, and the auditorium lights turned off. Agatha had presented Nicky with flowers after the show, and watched him walk to the car with Josh, their hands clasped and swinging. She'd turned right back around and gone back inside.</p><p>The stage had been abandoned in post-show disarray, and Agatha stood among the mess. Sweatshirts and crumpled papers littered the wings. She plucked a candy wrapper off the bottom of her shoe, and toed both of them off to the side of the stage. It felt like taking off her shoes at the end of any other long day, everyone packed up and headed home so that she could be alone in hers. </p><p>She wandered the wings, collecting discarded items for the lost and found. This wasn’t her job, but she was already here. She tried not to think of Jen and Wanda waiting for her at the restaurant down the street with a pitcher of sangria.</p><p>She paused at center stage and looked out into the dark house. She'd never done theater or dance as a kid, but she liked the <em> feeling </em> of it, not being able to see anything except her own hands in front of her face. Maybe she could learn, like Stellaluna, to love the dark. To understand which way was up, not because she could see the sky, but because she was simply meant to know.</p><p>She spotted Nicky’s pencil case on the ground, and shook herself out of her reverie, bending to retrieve it. It lay on top of a well-worn script. <em>Finally</em>, she thought—<em>answers</em>.</p><p>The front read: </p><p>
<b>PROPERTY OF BRYNN. DO NOT TOUCH!</b>
</p><p>She smiled and flipped through the packet. She recognized Brynn’s handwriting, which surprised her. It was the kind of thing she never thought about, the way someone’s words on paper were a leave-behind of the shape of their hand and the angle of their fingers that turned into a kind of sweet affection. The lines had gotten better, she mused, still stencil-straight and bafflingly even. </p><p>A sticky note fluttered out of the pages of the script, and she picked it up. Of course Brynn used sticky notes appropriately. She held it at a distance, squinting to read the scrawl. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Brynn– </em>
</p><p>
<em> I am so proud of you. You’ve worked so hard, and you are a superstar. Can’t wait to see you!  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Love, Mom. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha held the note for a minute. She walked to the edge of the stage and sat, legs dangling over the edge. The words tumbled in her head. For the third time that day—a record in the last decade—she thought about her mother.</p><p>Agatha had hated her mother, but her mother had hated her first. It had taken Agatha years to understand that it wasn’t supposed to be like that. She'd watched mothers pick up their children from her classroom and kiss their cheeks and squeeze them tight, and it had all seemed foreign and strange. </p><p>And then, she met Jen. Jen was bright-eyed and feisty and shy, all at the same time, with no mother to pick her up at the end of the day. Only a grandmother who rode the bus, and reliably ran late. So Agatha, twenty-two and unsure, would sit with Jen for an hour, sometimes two. </p><p>Jen would ask her every question under the sun until Grandma Kale came to get her with harried apologies and scattered thoughts. Jen would remind her of the way home, and give Agatha a hug goodbye so tightly, some days she had to pry her hands loose.</p><p>Sometimes, Agatha thought of the number of times she'd ridden the bus by herself by the time she was seven. She could barely read the names of the longer stops—she just memorized the shapes and colors of the signs. She hadn’t realized until Jen, how backwards she had it. The thought of letting Jen wait at a bus top by herself, scared and alone, was unimaginable. </p><p>She tried to call her mother that year, to somehow reach across the phone and share this thing she now knew, to demand answers, to understand. But she’d never picked up. Agatha realized she would never really know her mother, because Evanora Harkness would never let herself be known. But now—after standing side by side with Nicky in reindeer antlers, in front of a crowd—Agatha felt the injustice of it. Not only that her mother had never done this, but that she’d never seen Agatha do it, either. </p><p>She hadn't seen the way Agatha had learned to lead a room with one raised eyebrow. The way she kept a dozen kids afloat while keeping herself upright. But mostly, the way she'd stayed, when she could have quit, or left, or let herself waste away in her empty house. She'd built a life and a person. She'd become something remarkable. And Evanora Harkness had missed all of it, because she went and fucking died. </p><p>She hadn’t even had time to change her mind. To write Agatha a note in green felt tip pen that said, “I’m so proud of you,” and “can’t wait to see you.” To call her a <em>superstar</em>, even if all she did was a silly little dance.</p><p>Agatha blinked hard, but the tears came anyway, hot and quiet.</p><p>She clutched the sticky note in her fist. It wasn’t fair, or just. And she knew that because she’d learned about fairness and justice thirty years ago, on her mother’s flickering TV. </p><p>The auditorium doors creaked open. Agatha wiped her face quickly, brushing her hair back. She glanced behind her, pretending to inspect the sets.</p><p>“Sorry, Ma’am, I didn’t know anyone was still here.”</p><p>It was Happy, brandishing his walkie talkie.</p><p>“It’s fine, I’m just cleaning up a little,” she said, still looking behind her. “I didn’t know you were even here tonight.”</p><p>Happy peered at her a little closer at her bare feet. </p><p>“I'm always here. You okay?”</p><p>Agatha huffed.</p><p>“Why are you always asking me that?”</p><p>“Because I never really see you looking all that happy when you’re by yourself.” He paused in front of her, crossing his arms. “And you’re by yourself a lot.”</p><p>Agatha stared at him, at a loss, and then laughed a little in disbelief.</p><p>“Do you ever…” She paused, looking down at the note crumpled in her hand. “It’s stupid. My mom died, like, a really long time ago. And she was an evil bitch.”</p><p>“Sorry for your loss, Ma’am.”</p><p>“Don’t be. One time I threatened to run away, and she said she knew I would come back, because no one else would want me.”</p><p>Happy crossed his arms. “Sounds like a real piece of work.” </p><p>“Pretty much.” Agatha played with the edge of the paper. “Do you ever get mad knowing you’ll never be able to prove someone wrong?”</p><p>“It sounds like your mom wouldn’t know something good if it hit her in her fuckin’ face.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth dropped open, and Happy held his hands up. “Just my humble opinion.”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “That actually helps, a little.”</p><p>The doors creaked open again, and Agatha glimpsed a slip of movement, and a black hoodie. Happy turned to the noise, and then back to Agatha.</p><p>“So the first person you knew got it wrong,” he said. “That’s just bad luck. There are plenty of people here that know you’re made of the good stuff. You should probably pay more attention to them, instead of a dead evil bitch."</p><p>Agatha was so caught off guard, she laughed again. Happy grinned as he turned to leave, and Rio passed him, looking at them curiously.</p><p>“Lock up,” Happy called over his shoulder. “I don’t want to hear that this place was open all break for the high schoolers to vandalize.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah,” Agatha called.</p><p>Rio looked like she’d just run laps around the school—cheeks flushed, hoodie sleeves rolled up, hair falling loose over her shoulders. She had a candy cane sticking out of her mouth.</p><p>Agatha swiped a palm across her cheek, hoping her tears had dried. Rio didn’t say anything. Instead, she held out the reindeer headband Agatha had worn earlier. Agatha smiled, and put it on with a flourish.</p><p>“I thought you were going to drinks,” Rio said, settling across from her in the front row.</p><p>“I am." Agatha set Brynn’s note beside her and picked up Nicky’s pencil case instead. “I thought you had <em> plans.</em>” </p><p>“I do."</p><p>Agatha reached for the pencil case and unzipped it, not with any real curiosity, but because her hands needed something to hold. Her heels tapped against the edge of the stage.</p><p>“I told Josh not to get him these sparkly erasers; the pieces fall apart and it gets fucking everywhere.” She shook out her hand, the glitter already stuck stubbornly to her palm.</p><p>"I wanted to say thank you,” Rio said. “For earlier.”</p><p>Agatha glanced at her. “Oh. It was nothing. You know, all in a day’s work, or whatever.”</p><p>“It wasn’t nothing. It was…” She hesitated. “It was kind of fucking extraordinary.”</p><p>Agatha laughed. "That's a little dramatic."</p><p>“Well, so are you,” Rio said, smiling, and then picked at her nail, her smile fading. “Also, about yesterday. Is everything cool with Jen? She seemed… I don’t know. Upset.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened. She looked at Rio, at the flicker of worry tucked neatly underneath her practiced indifference.</p><p>“Yeah, it's fine," she said her voice tight. She looked at the pencil case, and turned the sparkly eraser over in her hand. “But maybe we should just do what you said. Keep it professional, stop hanging out in closets and…” She looked around. “Creepy, dark auditoriums. I think people are starting to get the wrong idea, you know, and I don’t want—”</p><p>She paused, gesturing between them.</p><p>“I just wouldn’t want that to affect our jobs. We make a good team.”</p><p>Rio raised her eyebrows. “Which <em>people </em>are getting the wrong idea?”</p><p>Agatha hesitated. “Jen,” she admitted. “And… Josh.”</p><p>Rio’s expression shifted, her lips curving into something sharper, and she leaned back in her seat. “Ah, <em> the husband. </em> I take it he finally remembered?”</p><p>“<em>Ex</em>-husband. And he’ll keep it to himself. We worked it out. ”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, her eyes still glinting. “How exactly? Same mysterious way you ‘worked it out’ with Paul?”</p><p>Agatha stared stubbornly, and Rio leaned forward, her voice still light. “And just so I know, what exactly is this <em> wrong idea </em> they’re getting?</p><p>“You know what I mean.”</p><p>“No,” Rio said. “Enlighten me.”</p><p>Agatha forced a shrug. “That there’s something... <em>going on</em>. Between us.” </p><p>“And you told them there wasn’t.”</p><p>“Obviously.” The incredulity in Agatha’s voice echoed across the stage.</p><p>Rio nodded, still looking at her. When she spoke, her voice was quieter.</p><p>“I have a date tonight, Agatha.” Rio said. “Those are my plans.”</p><p>Agatha felt the heat rise in her cheeks—at what, she wasn’t sure. Embarrassment, maybe? At the genuineness in Rio’s tone, like she had felt she needed to <em> let Agatha know</em>. To spare her the <em>heartbreak. </em></p><p>Agatha turned her head, and picked at a piece of blue masking tape.</p><p>“That’s great,” she said, and adjusted the reindeer headband. It caught in her hair. “That's impressive—a date at nine-thirty p.m. on the last day of the semester. I hope you have a great time. Don’t fall asleep.”</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched, and she watched her struggle with the plastic for a second. Then, she stood. She stepped forward into the space between Agatha’s knees. </p><p>“Here—” she reached up, gently working the plastic from where it had snagged. </p><p>Agatha went still. Rio’s hands in her hair and her hips nudging Agatha’s knees sent a tiny, treacherous shiver down her spine. Her fingers tightened around the pencil case.</p><p>Rio was too close, her arms reaching up to the sides of Agatha’s head, and for fuck’s sake, this is what Josh meant, and this is what Jen meant, and <em> this </em> is what couldn’t happen—with the door unlocked, with no four-inch hidden nook necessary to see their stupidity laid bare. </p><p>And before she could stop herself, she said it. She meant it as something definitive, to make Rio step back, but it came out like an unwilling admission of guilt as she sat before a backdrop of a poorly-painted courtroom.</p><p>“I fucked Paul.”</p><p>Rio froze. Her fingers, still tangled in Agatha’s hair, stopped moving. Her eyes widened.</p><p>“You… is that why he—”</p><p>“Don’t ask me that.”</p><p>They stood there. The headband was half-free. Agatha could feel her heart hammering against her ribs, every inch where Rio’s fingers touched her scalp, threaded in her hair, brushed her ears. </p><p>“You’re a good teacher,” Agatha said, quietly, evenly.</p><p>Rio nodded, slow, and looked up at her. “And that’s why you… fucked Paul.”</p><p>Agatha let the eraser fall back into the pencil case.</p><p>“Sort of,” she said. “But…don’t tell anyone. Because they might get—”</p><p>“—the wrong idea,” Rio finished for her. Her voice was almost gentle now, softer.</p><p>She pulled the headband out of Agatha’s hair, finally, and held it out to her. Agatha grasped one of the antlers, but Rio didn’t let go of the other. They stood there, each holding half of a Christmas headband, looking at each other.</p><p>Agatha swallowed. Her eyes fell to Rio’s lips.</p><p>“Yeah,” she said.</p><p>Rio let go first. She turned, running a hand through her hair, and stood there, taking in the dark house like Agatha had done not ten minutes ago. Agatha stared down at the plastic headband, and the pencil case in her glittering hands. She thought of pink poster paper Rio’s hands tucking in a borrowed shirt at Agatha’s waist. </p><p>She thought that maybe nothing ever really changed at all—that they were just living different versions of the same life, every month, every year, until she gave everyone and everything back, and had nothing but herself, standing in another empty room.</p><p>She was forty-two now. She knew how this went. Rio would leave to meet someone for drinks at nine-thirty on a Friday, which was code for <em> not-really-drinks.</em> And Agatha would go to her classroom and sit there instead of joining her friends for <em> really-drinks,</em> because she couldn't pretend to enjoy her chips and salsa under Jen’s newfound scrutiny and Wanda’s fraying patience.</p><p>Maybe she would just stay here, and live her life at her desk in ten minute breaks until she grew old with bugles and rollercoasters, because a simple four-step was never simple to begin with. </p><p>She wanted it to be yesterday again. After Rio took her hand, and before Jen sent them flying apart. If she closed her eyes, she could still hear the guitar. She could still feel the sway of her own body, like a buoy with the tide.</p><p><em> One, two, three</em>—</p><p>She heard the rustle of fabric, and a backpack hitting the floor.</p><p>She blinked her eyes open. Rio was in front of her again, and there was a buzzing in her ears. She felt calloused hands on either side of her jaw, pulling her head down, hard.</p><p>The simple four-step had never been simple to begin with, because Rio had never actually said <em> four</em>. She'd said <em> tap</em>. And that was different. Four was final, certain, certifiable proof of the end.</p><p>A tap was a hesitation. A breath before the fifth. A heel never quite touching the ground.</p><p>Agatha's feet weren’t touching the ground at all. They were dangling off the edge of a stage. And Rio was on her tiptoes, kissing her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha opened her mouth in a gasp of surprise. She heard the clatter of pencils and pens as the pouch emptied over her lap, her hands grasping at something to hold onto. The sound was distant, muffled in her ears. Rio kissed her relentlessly, lips pulling intently at Agatha’s. Her head tilted to reach her, hands falling to Agatha’s thighs, pulling her closer. And finally, Agatha caught up. She threaded her hands in Rio’s hair, thumbs stroking across her jaw, holding on for dear life.</p><p>It was fast and messy and too much at once, an uncoordinated, desperate collision. Rio’s tongue slid against hers, pulling unfamiliar, helpless sounds from her throat. She could feel Rio's thumbs digging into her thighs, and pencils poking at her, as Rio nipped at her bottom lip.</p><p>Their breaths were too loud. The sound of their mouths was too loud, echoing in the dark, bouncing across the stage, because the building architect may have overlooked the angle of the rows, but he <em>sure as</em> <em>shit</em> triple-checked the acoustics.</p><p>Rio hummed into Agatha’s mouth, a low catch of sound, and Agatha’s head felt, inexplicably, all-the-way quiet. Rio smelled like rain—like wet earth, and candy canes.</p><p>Her hand slid into the back of Agatha’s hair, pulling, tipping her head as if on instinct, breaking contact with her lips. Agatha bared her throat automatically.</p><p>Of all the faces of Rio she'd come to know, she hadn’t yet seen this—her mouth swollen, eyes impossibly dark, hair wild. Glitter sparkled along her jaw, left by Agatha’s grasping hand. </p><p>Rio’s eyes widened, as if she’d suddenly come to and found herself standing between Agatha’s legs, holding her by the hair. She let go suddenly, and stepped back.</p><p>There it was again, Agatha thought. The <em> one, two, three. </em></p><p>She curled her hands around the edges of the stage, trying to breathe, but her lungs refused the relief. Her lips felt bruised, and she realized her mouth was still open. She closed it.</p><p>Rio wiped the back of her hand across her mouth, and then kept it there.</p><p>“I—” she said, the sound muffled.</p><p>Agatha smoothed her hair back, looking at the pencils on the stage floor. She didn’t want to hear what came next.</p><p>She twisted around and picked them up, one by one, as if Rio hadn’t just kissed her within an inch of her life. As if her tongue hadn’t been in Rio’s mouth five seconds ago, tasting the sound of her quiet hum. </p><p>Up from the floor, into the case. One pencil, then two, and so on, and so. Like the first warm morning each year when she plucked the thistle from her porch. The soft, purple flowers from family <em> Asteraceae</em>, same as the sunflowers in the backyard. One standing tall with its face to the light, and the other a prickly weed, demanding sweat and leather gloves, and penance, on her knees.</p><p>“Have a good date,” Agatha said, voice smooth. She reached for a pencil that was stuck to Rio’s half-eaten candy cane. Her hand trembled lightly.</p><p>“Yeah, right. You too,” Rio said. “No, I mean—thanks. Yeah.”</p><p>It was silent then, and Agatha heard the quiet roaring in her ears, sick from the taste of peppermint on her tongue for an entirely new reason. And when she looked up, the pencils collected and penance paid, Rio was gone.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>On the twenty-fifth day of December, Agatha finally opened her four-day-old mail. She stood in her kitchen, her house too quiet. The front yard was bare of her usual Christmas army—three half-made snowmen, two fallen angels, and one shivering, ecstatic little boy. </p><p>She wanted the clean, satisfying rip of her finger through the paper seam. The envelope came apart softly in her hands instead. She held certificate number five by its bottom edge.</p><p> </p><p>
<b>COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS</b>
</p><p>
<b> <em>CERTIFICATE OF DIVORCE ABSOLUTE</em> </b>
</p><p> </p><p>And then, underneath the proceedings, in fine print: </p><p> </p><p>
<em><strong> This judgment restores the parties to the status of single, unmarried persons.</strong> </em>
</p><p> </p><p>So, on the twenty-fifth day of December, between her second and third cup of coffee, a piece of parchment between her forefinger and thumb—Agatha’s heels pressed solidly into the cold kitchen tile. </p><p>And if her heels were touching the ground, then this was beat four—the certifiable end of the measure. Which meant that, really, the fifth beat was the same thing as the first.</p><p>The fifth was the window cracked open to the storm, and fingers cricked tight against her jaw, and glitter under stage lights in June, or December.</p><p>Agatha didn’t rip the certificate in half, or burn it on her doorstep. It would have been too much trouble. The fifth certificate was just another envelope in the mail, stuck between the superstore coupons and the phone plan offerings for the couple next door. </p><p>She tucked it into the shoebox, next to the passports and her mother’s diamond earrings that she would maybe wear one day. And on the twenty-fifth day of December, Agatha let herself believe that maybe the fifth was just the beginning.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<br/>
</p><p>As a second grade teacher with twenty years of experience and two degrees under her belt, Agatha was more or less an expert on children between the ages of seven and eight. Before she was an expert, when she was just trying to pick a career that didn’t make her want to walk into traffic, she’d come across a book at a garage sale: <em> Your Seven Year-old: Life in a Minor Key. </em> An entire book dedicated to the nuances of seven—the unique tinge of anxiety and worry, and a fascination with the macabre. Agatha, intrigued, had tucked the book under her jacket when the woman wasn’t looking.</p><p>Agatha still wasn’t sure when it was or wasn’t okay to steal something if you really wanted it. She'd grown up watching Evanora pocket lottery tickets and expensive jewelry, and, if Agatha was lucky, an extra Twinkie. She was her mother’s daughter, after all—still watching <em> Law &amp; Order </em> on the cable her mother had ‘borrowed’ from next-door Norma, even though Norma was long dead and her son was only keeping the apartment for something called “market value.” </p><p>Evanora and Agatha had only moved away for one year before returning to the water-damaged walls of that shitty apartment, and Evanora’s mental faculties were growing worse by the day. Agatha wasn’t sure whether it was some sort of medical condition that made her lose her mind and her tongue, or a kind of drug Agatha didn’t know about, or if it was just the kind of person she was. Agatha knew she was smart enough to figure it out, but ultimately decided that reading about death-obsessed children was a better use of her time.</p><p>She read the book on her walk to school her senior year, after she'd decided to stop skipping class. She'd come to this decision over the summer, when Brandon Murphy had invited her to his house to watch <em>Good Will Hunting</em> on his new DVD player. She couldn’t have cared less about big-mouth Brandon and his weird, tall hair, but she couldn’t say no to a free movie. </p><p>They'd been halfway in before she’d realized that <em>she </em>was Will Hunting, stuck in Southie with a mother who'd never wanted her and made sure she knew it. The lights in Brandon’s basement were too bright, and her heartbeat picked up, and she felt that something important was happening.</p><p>That <em>something important</em> was definitely not Brandon sticking his tongue down her throat, and she finally shoved him off and snapped, “I’m trying to watch the fuckin’ movie,” with the Boston accent that would later fade, and the defiance that would not.</p><p>There was her life before that day, and her life after. Walking out of Brandon’s house as he waved pathetically from the doorstep, she understood what all the teachers had been going on about this whole time: people who went to college got to move away from their mothers. </p><p>So she decided on teaching. She would sidestep the usual potholes on her route, nose buried in the book, oblivious to the irony of possibly being hit by a car while reading about healthy child development. She was eighteen and hooked, and although she’d missed the mark on the whole<em> not-walking-into-traffic </em> aspect of the job, the book had steered her faithfully to <em> seven</em>.</p><p>On her second day of student teaching, when she was twenty-one, she’d been admonished by her mentor teacher, Mrs. Finegar—a rigid, ancient woman who called glasses <em> spectacles</em>, and carried a ruler in her hand. She never used it, of course, but Agatha often wondered if she should’ve even been allowed to carry it around like that, slapping her own palm like she was nostalgic for simpler times. Agatha quickly turned Mrs. Finegar to <em> Vinegar </em> in her head, both for the obvious reason and for her distinctly acidic qualities. </p><p>Vinegar had come in on the second day of school to find children crowded around Agatha, hushed and positively enraptured. Shocked that Agatha could quiet a crowd on just her second day, Vinegar came closer and saw what was captivating their attention—Agatha’s detailed drawing and description of the roadkill she’d seen on her way to school that morning. A skunk, as evidenced by the smell, portrayed by three wavy lines.</p><p>Agatha was explaining the different types of scavengers that survived off of decomposing flesh, and had just started to clarify that seagulls did, in fact, eat carrion in addition to the french fries from the school trash, when Vinegar slapped a hand down on the drawing. The children scattered to their seats, and she looked at Agatha through her spectacles settled low on the bridge of her nose. But Agatha, by nature, had never been wet behind the ears, and by nurture, she’d grown tired of righteous old women. She stared right back.</p><p>“This is incredibly inappropriate,” Vinegar hissed. “What were you thinking?”</p><p>“They wanted to learn,” Agatha replied with a shrug. “Sometimes, animals die.”</p><p>Vinegar reported her to her advisor and the district supervisor, and so began the reputation she did not choose. But that same day, a small girl with ringlets named Lucille came up to her desk. She asked loudly why a seagull would want to eat a dead skunk instead of a live one, when her pet gecko wouldn’t eat the crickets she was feeding him from the freezer. </p><p>“Frank only eats the ones that jump,” she’d said, her eyes wide and curious. </p><p>And so, two hours later, began the reputation Agatha did choose. Vinegar left her alone after that, to her simple truths and the macabre—to conduct the room in her beloved minor key. At twenty-one, six years after a movie convinced her to try, Agatha had something better than Will Hunting’s chalkboard equation: her very first class of seven year-olds, won over in earnest by a drawing of a dead skunk.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Today, Agatha had half a mind to contact the authors of <em> Your Seven Year-Old: Life in a Minor Key </em> and sue them for false advertising. They’d claimed <em> seven </em> was less wild than <em> six </em> or <em> eight, </em>and now the book sat smugly on a shelf in her living room, presiding over a pile of spaghetti Nicky had ceremoniously dumped on the hardwood floor.</p><p>Nicky, by all accounts, was an angelic child, and Agatha felt uniquely qualified to make the assessment. He was even-tempered, empathetic, sweet, and fun. But tonight, on this evening in January of a brand new year, her angelic child was standing over his upside-down bowl of spaghetti, staring her dead in the eyes.</p><p>“Nicky,” she said slowly, her forehead vein pulsing. “Pick it up.”</p><p>“No."</p><p>His voice was calm enough for Agatha to break out of her fraying patience for a second and wonder—not for the first time—if maybe her kid was so angelic because he was actually a sociopath. </p><p>A blob of tomato sauce dotted his ankle, and she spotted bits of parmesan cheese in his tangled hair. She felt the restrained rage in her chest scratching desperately for release. He hadn’t even dropped it by accident—he'd lost all semblance of control, and thrown it off the table in a fit of fury, all because she'd said “no ice cream.”</p><p><em> This is so cliché</em>, she wanted to tell him. <em> Losing your shit over no dessert. </em></p><p>But there were two problems with that. The first, and the most obvious, was that children <em> were </em> cliché. They had basic needs and basic reactions and it was all so expected and unavoidable. She knew that too well, twenty times over by the year. But no one—authors, teachers, or otherwise—had informed her how much harder it would be when she had to bring the kid home at the end of the day.</p><p>The second, and newer problem, was that she was alone. She lost her power as a seasoned educator the moment Nicky stepped through the front door each afternoon. Everything she said was useless, and everything he said seemed deliberately designed to drive her up the wall. Now it was just her, alone in her living room, with him.</p><p>She couldn’t do what she knew she should—stand here with him and make him clean it up, or <em> de-escalate</em>, like she could any other time of the day or day of the week. It was three minutes past his bedtime, and there was a marinara crime scene all over him and the hardwood floor, and now he needed a shower, which meant she’d be getting one, too. The last time they had worked on Nicky showering by himself, he’d gotten distracted by a soap bubble for twenty minutes and forgotten all of the instructions. Agatha had decided maybe they would try again in a year, and not a day sooner.</p><p>“School starts tomorrow,” Agatha said. “Don’t you want to get in your comfy-cozy bed and have a nice, big sleep, and wake up excited and ready to go?”</p><p>She almost heard laughing in her head as she said it, recognizing the absurdity of thinking that line had ever worked on a stubborn, wound-up child.</p><p>“NO!” Nicky shouted, and ran to the bathroom.</p><p>Agatha heard his feet pattering on the hardwood, and watched his trail of tomato sauce footprints. She closed her eyes, and took a deep breath. And then another. She took off her glasses, tied her hair back, and tore off a few paper towels. Maybe he was washing his hands, she thought hopefully. And his hair, and his clothes. </p><p>She scooped the spaghetti up by hand, dumped it in the trash, and knelt to tackle the sauce. She didn’t have it in her—a standoff with the only person alive who could win. Or maybe one of two people, she amended, her knees aching from the floor. </p><p>Her chest still burned at the thought of Rio, two weeks later. She’d spent every spare day to herself trying to distract the singular pull of her own mind—lying in bed for hours in the middle of the day, scrolling and snacking and reverting to a version of herself she hadn’t known in years. She thought some people called this <em> depression</em>, and others called it <em> rest</em>. </p><p>Sometimes, out of nowhere, she would feel it the sudden hush in the auditorium, and Rio’s voice turned soft, and her hands in Agatha’s hair. Her lips, her teeth, her tongue. And then the look on her face, like she didn’t know what to do, even though she was the one who had <em>done </em> in the first place.</p><p>Since November, she'd grown used to imagining the feel of Rio’s lips on hers and her breath in her ear. She already <em>knew</em> the feel of her skin, the scratch of lace against her chest in the dark, and now that she’d given herself permission to remember, it had almost become a habit. Her breath rasping, thighs shaking, hand pressing hard between them. </p><p>But she read somewhere that it took sixty-six days to make a habit, and she’d only made it to fifty-nine before Rio kissed her on the stage in the dark. She hadn’t touched herself since, so the hobby died just seven days short.</p><p>The problem was that if she thought about the kiss, she thought about what came after. She didn’t want to keep seeing it in slow motion, Rio stepping back with a hand to her mouth in panic and regret. But the real, truer problem was much worse than that: she wanted, desperately, for it to happen again. She was aching for it, and knew she couldn’t have it. Another humiliating cliché. </p><p>The paper towel ripped under her hand, and she realized she’d been scrubbing the saturated sauce back into the floor. She sat up, wiping her forehead with the back of her arm, and dropped the wad of paper towels next to her. Sometimes, being a full person and raising another was altogether too hard to be expected of her.</p><p>She heard a quiet pattering and looked up. Nicky had returned, and was looking at her curiously. He'd changed his shirt, which was backwards, and not the piece of clothing that had sauce on it in the first place.</p><p>“Are you okay, Mama?” He put his arms around her neck and leaned his dead weight on her, falling into her lap. </p><p>“No,” she sighed, looking down at him. “I’m upset that you threw your dinner on the floor.”</p><p>Nicky looked at her, his eyes wide and genuine, no trace of the stubbornness from five minutes ago.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” he said seriously. “I was just mad because I really want ice cream and you said no.”</p><p>She rubbed his back as he patiently explained this to her in his halting little speech. She wished that her seven year old understood the basic logic and necessity of not eating dessert for every meal, and knew it was an impossibility due to the size of his tiny brain. </p><p>“I know, baby,” she said finally, squeezing him. “We just can’t eat it every day anymore, okay?”</p><p>“Okay,” he said sullenly, and she smiled a little.</p><p>“Thanks for changing your shirt.”</p><p>He grinned then, swinging from her neck in her lap, and she grimaced. He was getting too big to use her like a jungle gym, but she wasn’t ready to tell him to stop. Maybe one more year for that, too.</p><p>“Let’s play hot-lava-tag,” he squealed in her ear.</p><p>There was quite literally nothing in the world she wanted to do less right now, and the thought weighed on her. It was the unique shape and pull of Mother’s Guilt, that she should be used to this kind of thing. That she was <em>uniquely qualified </em> for it.</p><p>Her phone rang, and she breathed in relief, moving Nicky off of her lap with a kiss. He bounded to the living room anyway, apparently set on playing with or without her. She watched the phone vibrate over a stack of bills, and inexplicably, she wondered if it was Rio. Two weeks was the longest she hadn’t heard from her. Maybe she was calling to quit. Or maybe she wanted to <em> talk</em>, which was somehow worse. </p><p>If she waited any longer to grab her phone, it would vibrate itself straight off the counter. She waited for two more seconds before flipping it over. A string of numbers filled the screen, and she breathed in relief, again.</p><p>“Hello?” She leaned against the counter to watch Nicky, who was jumping between the couch cushions on the floor.</p><p>“Hi, this is OB Pharmacy calling to let you know that your prescription is ready for pickup.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “I picked it up last week. Birth control, right?”</p><p>“No, I have an inhaler refill for Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p>“No,” she stuttered. “That’s not— I’m not— Who put down this number?”</p><p>“We received it from the office of your primary care provider.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “No—who, <em> specifically</em>?”</p><p>She heard the rustle of papers. “A nurse named…Darcy Lewis?”</p><p>Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose. That fucking idiot of a nurse. She’d said <em> emergency contact</em>, not <em> pharmacy. </em></p><p>Agatha hung up and called Rio three times with no answer. Her worry turned acutely from <em> What the fuck am I going to say</em>, to <em> what if she’s lying in a ditch somewhere and can’t breathe</em>?</p><p>She looked at Nicky.</p><p>“It’s your lucky day, kid.” Nicky paused from jumping on a sofa cushion to look at her. “Get your coat. We’re going on a field trip.”</p><p>“Yay!” Nicky yelled, and threw his hands in the air.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Agatha sat in her car with the paper bag in the passenger seat and Nicky in the back, bobbing along to the music. Not for the first time, she regretted her moment of weakness in the hospital on Halloween. So what? Rio had no emergency contact. Plenty of people had no emergency contact. She could have just kept her mouth shut like a normal, casual work acquaintance. But she hadn't, and now, there were admittedly no good options.</p><p>She called a fourth time, this time out of desperation. The line connected on the third ring, and she heard Lilia’s distinctive ‘Hello?” </p><p>“Is Rio okay?” she blurted, gut twisting with equal parts worry and guilt. What if Rio had suffocated to death, all because Agatha had put her name down? This would be her second accidental murder attempt in three months.</p><p>“I’m sure she is,” Lilia said. “Your calls are getting a little disruptive. I was in the middle of a session and I could hear the damn phone vibrating from the next room.”</p><p>Agatha suppressed her immediate response, which included some choice language she was at least sixty percent sure Nicky hadn't heard before. </p><p>“Where is she," she said instead. "I need to talk to her.” </p><p>“Why is it I only hear from you when you don’t know where she is?”</p><p>“Because you’re her roommate! And I called <em> Rio</em>.” </p><p>“Well, I thought I would have heard from you by now about how your tarot draw is faring,” Lilia said. “I may be clairvoyant, but that doesn’t mean I don’t appreciate a little feedback.”</p><p>“How could I give you feedback? You don’t have a phone." Agatha ignored the flush crawling up her face. “Listen—I have Rio’s inhaler refill. Does she need it tonight, or can I bring it to school tomorrow?”</p><p>“Intriguing,” Lilia hummed. “I wouldn’t know.”</p><p>“Thought you were clairvoyant,” Agatha grumbled, and Lilia chuckled at that.</p><p>“I think you know that Rio requires more of us than a simple convening of the spirits. But she doesn’t usually need a new inhaler so quickly. And she <em>is</em> doing manual labor today, so best if you drop it off with her just in case.”</p><p>Agatha grimaced. “Manual labor? Is that what we’re calling it now?”</p><p>“Not at the club, dear. Different kind of labor.”</p><p>“How about I drop it off with you?”</p><p>“Absolutely not. I have another client tonight and I will not have your <em> sodden </em> aura in my living room to dampen the spirits.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head back against the headrest, and closed her eyes. Nicky kicked the back of her seat.</p><p>“Can you at least tell me if this place is G-rated?” Agatha said finally. “My kid is with me.”</p><p>“Johnny’s Christmas Tree farm, right outside Salem. You can’t miss it.”</p><p>“It’s <em> January."</em></p><p>“You asked, I answered. I thought you would be thrilled—no traffic, twenty-minute drive, and not even raining. This time, you can show up without looking like a drowned cat. Now, is there any other critical, <em> free </em> information I can provide for you, or may I go back to honing my craft and making a living?”</p><p>Agatha almost smiled at the satisfaction of pulling an ounce of frustration from her.</p><p>“That will be all, <em> dear</em>,” she sneered, and Lilia promptly hung up.</p><p>She caught Nicky’s eye in the rearview. “How’s the super special nighttime field trip?”</p><p>“Fun,” Nicky said, wide-eyed, and Agatha smiled.</p><p>“Good. I think you’re going to like our next stop even better.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The sign to the farm was massive, but unlit—Agatha almost missed it. She turned at the last second, crunching into the gravel beside another car. Rio’s car.</p><p>“Mama, where are we?” Nicky asked, craning his neck.</p><p>“That,” Agatha said, twisting around, “is an excellent question. Ms. V forgot something, and I need to give it to her.”</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“Medicine.”</p><p>“Is she sick?”</p><p>“No, she’s fine.”</p><p>Nicky looked out the window again. “Can I say hi to her?”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “Of course, baby. But don’t tell any of the kids tomorrow that you got to see her before school started, okay? It’ll be our little secret.”</p><p>Nicky nodded, holding a finger to his lips, and unbuckled with great effort, pushing both hands into the red button. Agatha still liked watching him do that—grasp independence with both hands, through this small thing they’d taught him. One day he would just need one hand, and then just a thumb. And then he wouldn’t be sitting in the backseat at all, but she didn’t like to think about that part.</p><p>The gravel crunched under their feet, and the air was sharper here. She'd grown up in the city with little ability to leave it, and was still baffled that twenty minutes could take them from suburbs to farmland and forest.</p><p>By the time she was done zipping up Nicky’s layers, he was restless, hopping from one foot to the other. His sneakers lit up with each jump, colors flashing across the light dusting of snow.</p><p>“I see her,” he said, pointing and tugging on Agatha’s hand. </p><p>Agatha whipped her head around in the direction of his finger, and squinted. Down a dirt and gravel path, at the bottom of a gentle hill, lights poked through the darkness. She could make out farmhouse windows, and a figure moving faintly in front of them.</p><p>“Can you really see that far?” Agatha said, adjusting her glasses, and Nicky nodded at her. Either he was full of shit, or her vision was getting worse.</p><p>“Okay, let’s go,” she said, holding his hand. “And this is someone else’s property. So best behavior, okay?”</p><p>“Is this Ms. V’s house?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Who lives here?”</p><p>“I don’t—” Agatha caught the response just before it snapped, the barbs catching in her throat. She took a breath, and they loosened. “I don’t know, baby. Let’s find out.”</p><p>“<em>Okay,</em>” Nicky said emphatically, pulling on her hand. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Agatha could see her breath as she walked, and she steeled herself. Either Rio was slowly dying and would be <em> very </em> glad to see her, or she wasn’t, which would make this all much harder to explain.</p><p>As they wove down the path, the moon shone brightly above them. To her right, Christmas trees stood deep green and stiff, pine needles glinting silver. To her left, they lay on the ground in heaps, branches twisted and snapped in places. She spotted a dented red ornament on a broken branch.</p><p>As the lights and the farmhouse grew nearer, Agatha could see that the figure in front was, in fact, Rio. She stood by the light of the porch in a black hoodie. Her arms were raised above her head, holding—an <em>axe?</em> Agatha watched as she brought it down in one precise, brutal motion, slamming it into the dead tree trunk in front of her. The sharp <em> crack </em> split the silence, and Agatha stopped in her tracks.</p><p>Nicky glanced back at her, frustrated at the interruption in pace, and Agatha stared at Rio. She looked a little terrifying, hooded and backlit, the axe clutched tight at her side. The moon gave her face a ghostly glow where it escaped the shadows of her hood, eyes gleaming and sweat glistening on her nose. She stood perfectly still in the silence, and the only thing moving was her chest, rising and falling, the air releasing into clouds in front of her lips. <em>Alive, </em> Agatha thought. Rio was so <em>alive</em>.</p><p>She felt her pulse spike, her breath coming faster. Rio was oblivious in the pitch dark, the axe raised above her head again. Her face was strangely, eerily calm. And Agatha was suddenly furious.</p><p>She had been crawling out of her own skin for two weeks, enduring days of exhaustion and half-dreams where she could still feel hands in her hair and gripping her jaw, with no idea why Rio had lost her <em> fucking </em> mind for thirty seconds, then apparently forgotten about it. Because here she was, splitting logs under the moonlight like some ridiculous<em>,</em> stoic lesbian lumberjack.  </p><p>Before she could decide whether to announce herself or just throw the inhaler at Rio’s head, Nicky beat her to it.</p><p>He yelled “Hi,” innocently into the night. The word hit Rio like someone had poured ice water down her sweatshirt. Her head jerked up, eyes wide, hood falling back. The axe dropped to her side.</p><p>She froze, eyes on Nicky, and then a surprised laugh burst out of her as he threw his arms around her legs in a thoughtless hug. She hugged him back with her free hand, and her eyes found Agatha’s, her mouth still open in disbelief.</p><p>“What…” she started, and Agatha could already feel the heat in her own cheeks at the humiliation of driving to Salem to save Rio’s life, only to find her perfectly alive, athleticism and strength on full display. Agatha stepped closer and thrust the paper bag toward Rio.</p><p>“Lilia told me where you were. I didn’t know if you—” Her voice caught, the briskness in her tone undercut by the wet click. She cleared her throat, and tried again. “I thought maybe you needed this.”</p><p>Rio took the bag slowly, peering inside.</p><p>“This is mine?”</p><p>“There was a phone number mix-up with your pharmacy,” Agatha said flatly. “And a nurse who should be fired. Or shot into the fucking sun.”</p><p>“A <em> mix-up</em>,” Rio repeated, watching her.</p><p>Agatha shifted. Her chest was tight and the cool, fresh air wasn’t helping. Maybe <em> she </em> needed the inhaler.</p><p>“I put myself down as your emergency contact,” she said finally, the words squeezing out of her. “On Halloween.”</p><p>Rio blinked, and her face shifted. She looked stunned, her mouth slightly open.</p><p>“Nicky,” Agatha snapped, watching him reach for the axe out of the corner of her eye. “Don’t.”</p><p>He looked away innocently, and wandered to a pile of branches out of earshot, jumping over it.</p><p>“If you’re inches from death, I’m going to need to know about it,” Agatha said, waving a hand dismissively. “Logistically speaking. But you can take me off whenever you want.”</p><p>Rio was still staring at her, the start of a smile on her lips, and Agatha bristled. </p><p>“Like, if Lilia gets a phone,” she continued. “Or if you and your… mysterious <em> hot date </em> get serious.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“She’s not mysterious. She’s pretty uncomplicated, actually.”</p><p>Agatha felt the pointed edge under her casualness, and looked away.</p><p>“And let me get this straight,” Rio continued. “You drove to Salem on a Sunday night to ask me about my date from two weeks ago?”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched. “Of course not,” she said, too fast. “I drove to Salem because you left your fucking phone at home, and I didn’t know if you were—” She stopped abruptly.</p><p>Rio’s expression softened. Her eyes shifted to the ground, and then back to Agatha’s.</p><p>“I’m fine.”</p><p>“Yeah, I can see that.” </p><p>They stood there for a few seconds in silence, Agatha staring at the pieces of tree trunk at their feet. Rio’s axe rested against the ground like a sinister sort of cane—blade in the dirt, twirling idly between her fingers. It fit, somehow. <em> She </em> fit here.</p><p>Agatha wondered who else had ever been invited here besides her, and then remembered that she wasn’t actually invited at all. She had just shown up without warning, expecting…<em> what</em>, exactly?</p><p>She felt the trees on either side of her, watching them, her feet planted in the gravel—one foot on the side of the living, the other with the dead. Her hands felt empty without the crinkle of the paper bag, or Nicky’s tugging grasp.</p><p>“Right. Well.” She gestured to Nicky. “Sorry for the interruption. We’ll see you tomorrow.”</p><p>“You said we were having a field trip,” Nicky whined.</p><p>“We did, and it’s over now,” Agatha said sharply, and Nicky’s face crumpled into a scowl. Agatha turned to face him fully, and opened her mouth.</p><p>“You guys can stay and help, if you want,” Rio offered.</p><p>Nicky looked at Agatha hopefully, and she ground her teeth together. She was outnumbered. </p><p>“What is it you’re <em> doing</em>, exactly?” she said instead of answering. “Also, <em> where are we</em>?”</p><p>Rio grinned, wide and easy, and Agatha stared at her. Her smile was easier, bigger, open. Maybe it was just the two weeks of rest, or the fact that she was having stupid hot sex with an <em> uncomplicated </em> stranger, or maybe it was something about this dark, cold air. </p><p>“Lilia grew up here."</p><p>“Really?” Agatha replied despite herself, kicking idly at the stray wood chips. “I always figured she grew up, in, like, a cult. Or a commune.”</p><p>Rio laughed. “She lived here with her four sisters for a long time, so I guess that’s not far off.”</p><p>“Who’s Johnny?” Agatha pointed to the sign, and Rio smiled.</p><p>“They inherited this place in the seventies and they wanted to name it after Joni Mitchell. Shockingly, suburban men from Massachusetts in the seventies did not want to drive their families to a farm called Joni’s, run by five women.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, impressed despite herself. “One point for Lilia.”</p><p>“She and the two sisters that are left fight like crazy, so I usually leave Lilia at home. But the other two are getting too old for this kind of work, and I don’t mind it.”</p><p>“What are you doing?” Nicky asked, back from his stick-hopping quest.</p><p>“I’m taking the old trees that people return after Christmas,” Rio said, pointing to the piles. “And then I’m chopping them up into smaller pieces, so that we can toss them in the wood chipper, and turn it into mulch.”</p><p>“Christmas trees turn into dirt?” Nicky asked, nose scrunched.</p><p>Rio smiled. “Yup, and then they use the dirt to plant the next round of trees, and vegetables and flowers in the spring.”</p><p>“Cool."</p><p>“Very,” Rio agreed. “Do you think you can find all the smaller sticks and branches lying on the ground, and come bring them to this pile?”</p><p>Nicky nodded enthusiastically and ran off without question.</p><p>“Maybe this will finally tire him out,” Agatha muttered. “The kid is fucking nocturnal.”</p><p>“I was being serious,” Rio said, eyeing her. “If you’re going to stay, you need to help.”</p><p>“Jesus fucking Christ, <em> okay.</em>” Agatha was still a little incredulous at the whole thing, and still a little furious. She glared, and held up her hands. “Tell me what to do.”</p><p>Rio smirked, her eyes catching the moonlight. Agatha swallowed, and regretted her choice of words. </p><p>“Drag over the medium and large ones. Here.” Rio tossed Agatha a pair of leather gloves from the ground. “Think you can handle that?”</p><p>Agatha scoffed, and didn’t bother with an answer. She got to work, her breath fogging in the dark, trying not to think about how she had ended up on a farm, watching Rio chop wood like an image straight from some low-quality lesbian porn. Agatha had once watched one that started exactly like this—a woman with an axe, the tree stump, and a voluptuous caretaker pulling up in a pickup. Then a jarring cut to the two of them fucking against said tree stump, both of them unrealistically fresh-faced, not a hair out of place. She’d turned it off once she started thinking about splinters. Neither of the women looked like they were enjoying it, anyway, and Agatha had decided she wasn’t particularly interested in the type altogether.</p><p>Now, though, with Rio’s hands gripped tight over the handle of the axe, her breath coming in sharp bursts against the night air, and the muscles Agatha knew were rippling at her back underneath the sweatshirt—Agatha was suddenly having second thoughts. First about the type, and then about every last decision she’d made in the last hour.</p><p>They worked for almost an hour in near silence. Agatha had forgotten how good it felt to have her hands in the earth, even through leather gloves. The last time she'd tried, besides the necessary weeding under her porch, was five years ago, when she attempted to grow a garden outside her classroom. In a matter of weeks, the squirrels had eaten the sunflowers and the tomatoes, and the wooden base had fallen apart, and then stayed that way. But now, she could just work. The life cycle of Christmas trees wasn’t hers to own, or to tend. She was just visiting. </p><p>Agatha straightened, her arms starting to ache, and wiped her forehead with the sleeve of her coat.</p><p>“Okay, what is all of this?” she said finally, gesturing vaguely at Rio. Rio paused, eyebrows raised expectantly.</p><p>“Why are you acting so…” Agatha trailed off. “Happy?”</p><p>Rio snorted, and Agatha lowered her voice. “Just be honest. A farm named after Joni Mitchell, and four other versions of Lilia? The weed in that house has got to be fucking incredible.”</p><p>“You think I’m <em> high </em>right now?” Rio laughed, and Agatha crossed her arms. She ignored the twist of jealousy at the thought that this sudden lightness might be about a couple good dates, and a person she knew nothing about. </p><p>“I just like it here,” Rio said. “It’s—”</p><p>“<em>Uncomplicated</em>,” Agatha offered, with a little more bite than she intended.</p><p>Rio’s eyes flashed, just briefly.</p><p>“Yeah." </p><p>Agatha dropped her leather gloves on the stump, running a hand through her hair. She felt the banter turning brittle, as it always seemed to. She spotted Nicky in the dirt pile, drawing pictures with his finger. He yawned, wide and slow, and Agatha knew it was past time to put him to bed. She remembered suddenly that she’d left the towels of tomato sauce on her hardwood floor.</p><p>Rio followed her gaze and put down her axe, nodding in question to the farmhouse. Agatha hesitated. Maybe a few more minutes would be harmless. It would be pointless to spend all this time doing the work without the prize of seeing the inside of Lilia’s old house, so she nodded her head once in reply.</p><p>“I could really use some hot chocolate,” Rio said loudly.</p><p>Nicky’s head shot up, and Agatha tried not to laugh as he scrambled to his feet.</p><p>“I want hot chocolate,” he said. “Can I have some too?”</p><p>“Let’s go see if there’s enough.”</p><p>“I really hope there is,” he said, on her heels. “Or maybe I can make more. I know how to make it.”</p><p>Agatha snorted at that. “Hope it’s comfy down in that grave you just dug,” she muttered, and Rio turned to smirk at her, tongue in cheek, as the warmth enveloped them.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t know what to expect from a farm dedicated to Joni Mitchell in the seventies by five opinionated sisters. She wouldn’t have guessed what it looked like, and yet, everything she looked at seemed perfectly placed.</p><p>Her mouth hung open at the sheer volume of <em> things </em> covering the walls and stuffed in the corners. It was less of a collection, and more just accumulation. There was no clear style, surfaces covered with seashells and ceramics shaped like farm animals. It seemed like each sister had preferred a specific style—disco, beach, boho, cottage, modern farmhouse—and no one had wanted to relinquish their own in favor of any sort of cohesion.</p><p>She paused to look at the wall of photos, eyes landing on a large portrait in the middle: five women, standing in a kickline.</p><p>“Holy shit,” she murmured. “Lilia was <em> hot</em>.”</p><p>“What do you mean <em> was</em>?” Rio laughed from the kitchen. “They’re all timeless bombshells. Except maybe the dead ones.”</p><p>“Are they here? The live ones?” Agatha peered around the room like they might emerge from the corners with tchotchkes held like pitchforks to the strangers in their kitchen.</p><p>“Poker night across town,” Rio said, distracted. She was pouring Nicky a mug of hot cocoa from a thermos, and Agatha felt a flicker of recognition at the color of the cup.</p><p>“Not to be boring and uptight,” Agatha said. “But is that the Fiestaware with or without the uranium in it?”</p><p>“I replaced the vintage,” Rio said with a smile. “All Fiestaware is post-nineties.”</p><p>“What’s uranium?” Nicky said, taking a big sip.</p><p>“Something you are not allowed to eat.”</p><p>“I want to try it,” Nicky said, and Agatha rolled her eyes. </p><p>“Hey, can you go drink that at the table?” </p><p>“Can I drink it on the couch?” </p><p>Agatha glared at him, and Rio cleared her throat. </p><p>“It’s in the next room," she said. “And there’s a basket of toys and games and stuff in there, too, if you want to look through it.” </p><p>Nicky held the cup carefully, walking slowly to the living room.</p><p>“Is that how you know Lilia?” Agatha looked at the photo again. “She was a dancer?”</p><p>“Big time. But then she kind of lost her shit a little. Or, the way she puts it, she had a <em> different calling</em>.”</p><p>“Seriously? She quit dancing to be a psychic?”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “She loves what she does. Can’t really argue with that.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her carefully. “Do you believe in that stuff? That she can really see the future, or whatever?”</p><p>Rio blew air out of the side of her mouth, pulling two beers out of the fridge.</p><p>“When I was seventeen, I tried to steal some gas station sushi for dinner, and I got caught. I was sitting in handcuffs outside, and Lilia Calderu, a former <em> Radio City Rockette</em>, appeared out of nowhere, telling the cop she was my mother.”</p><p>Agatha stared.</p><p>“My parents had only kicked me out that morning,” Rio continued. “The only way I knew Lilia was from an essay I wrote on her in school. If you can explain that to me, then maybe I’ll be more skeptical. But some things defy logic, and I’ve come to accept that <em>Lilia</em>,” she tilted her bottle towards Agatha, “is one of them.”</p><p>She took a long swig, and Agatha took the second bottle, picturing Lilia sweeping her shawl over teenage Rio in handcuffs.</p><p>“Did you ever ask her about it?”</p><p>“I tried, at first." Rio smiled. “But you know how she is. For all I know, the <em> spirits </em>told her I needed a place to stay. Or maybe they told her I was about to fucking die from eating two-dollar gas station sushi. Either way, she showed up. I don’t really care why.”</p><p>Rio leaned forward on the counter, brushing her hair back, her sweatshirt thrown on the kitchen chair. She wore a <em> Goonies </em> t-shirt, and Agatha smiled. She wondered how old Rio had been when she watched <em>The Goonies</em> for the first time, and then her smile faded, thinking of her parents.</p><p>“I’m sorry your parents kicked you out,” Agatha said, rubbing the label of the bottle. It felt like an insane thing to say, but she didn’t know how to edge past it gracefully.</p><p>Rio smirked. “You don’t even know why they kicked me out. What if I was a teenage menace to society?”</p><p>“Were you?”</p><p>Rio laughed, and then chewed her bottom lip.</p><p>“Worse,” she said finally. “I fell in love with a girl.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers tightened around the bottle.</p><p>“What happened?” she asked softly. “If you want to– I mean, you don’t have to, if you–”</p><p>“She was a cheerleader,” Rio grinned. “We were studying for a math test in my room one day, and she started touching my face and stuff, so I kissed her. She kissed me back, tongue and all, like a fucking maniac. You know how it is when you’re young and everything just feels so… sparky and desperate?”</p><p>Agatha thought of the first time she kissed a boy playing <em>seven minutes in heaven</em> in sixth grade, feeling unsure where to put her hands. Then she thought of the high school dates in the park on summer nights, that inevitably ended with half-hearted hand jobs so she could go home in time to put Benadryl cream on her mosquito bites and watch <em> Xena</em>. So, maybe she didn’t really know. Maybe she'd never known.</p><p>“So…yeah,” Rio said. “I let her finger me all over my algebra textbook, and it was probably <em> so </em> terrible, but at the time, I was obviously like, ‘<em>Fuck yeah</em>, this is the meaning of life.’”</p><p>“Are you telling this story to brag that you fucked a cheerleader in high school?” Agatha said, and Rio laughed. Agatha's eyes caught on the exposed column of her throat, and the stray wood chips nestled in her hair. The confidence in her posture, smug and unashamed. </p><p>Agatha flicked her bottle cap across the counter and hit her in the arm.</p><p>“Ow. Don’t be jealous.”</p><p>“What next, Velma?” Agatha said innocently, settling on a barstool with her chin in hand. “Did you go down on Daphne with a calculator and a magnifying glass?”  </p><p>“No time," Rio shot back. "She got up off me, walked right into the kitchen crying, and told my parents I was the devil. She didn’t even wash her hands.”</p><p>Agatha stared.</p><p>“It’s fine,” Rio said, swallowing a sip and letting out a burp. "She’s in prison now.” </p><p>Agatha choked on her beer. “Really?” </p><p>“No. She's a preacher’s wife. But kind of the same thing, right?”</p><p>Agatha felt the laugh burst out of her. </p><p>“I’m <em> really </em>sorry that didn’t work out for you,” she said, catching her breath. Then after a beat, she added, “And I <em> am </em> sorry that your parents kicked you out.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers played absently with the pepper shaker between them, shaped like Road Runner. There was a chip in the base, and Rio balanced him on his edge, catching him as he fell. Balance, tip, fall, catch. </p><p>“I don’t need pity,” Rio said finally. Road Runner teetered on one leg for almost a full second this time. Agatha wondered if he would stay there, somehow perfectly balanced on a single rounded leg, but then the second passed, and he fell into Rio’s waiting hand. </p><p>“What I need,” she said, “is some goddamn generational wealth.”</p><p>Agatha snorted and reached for the salt shaker. She held the ceramic Wile E. Coyote, and inspected his gleaming yellow eyes and sharpened teeth. He was holding a stick of red dynamite. </p><p>“I don’t pity you,” she said, tracing the shape of his black nose, and then the fuse. “Some sorries are still worth saying.”</p><p>She set Wile E. down, pointing him towards Rio’s restless hands, and wandered around the kitchen. She knew there was only so long she could rummage through junk and turn over undisturbed treasures before Rio’s patience wore thin. She hid her smile as she pilfered through drawers.</p><p>She picked up farm-animal utensils, and “<em>oohed </em>” at a display of seven different-sized rolling pins. She inspected the uranium-free dishware, and read the label of three different bottles in the wine rack, letting out two sounds of disgust and one appreciative hum. A small, square photo on the fridge caught her attention, and she paused her theatrics, moving closer.</p><p>It was Rio, her eyes somehow even bigger in her younger face. She looked maybe eighteen or nineteen, in a full split on the front porch, hands in the air. She had bangs, and there was a blur of a black, curly dog next to her. It was strange, this section of a full, real life Agatha knew nothing about. </p><p>Then, she noticed a picture to the side. Rio, around the same age, but she was sitting in the porch rocking chair instead. Her leg was propped up on a stool, knee in bandages, a pair of crutches leaning beside her. The sunset cast her face in orange, and she stared into the distance, her eyes glowing hazel and lost in thought. Her hand clutched the crutch too tight, her healthy knee bent protectively to her chest.</p><p>Before Agatha could comment, Rio plucked the second photo from the fridge and tucked it in her pocket. Agatha raised her eyebrows.</p><p>“I don’t like that one,” Rio said quietly.</p><p>“Hmm. Picky,” Agatha replied. “I’m sure they’d prefer a photo of you dancing on some sweaty frat boy with a boner. You know, if you had one on hand.”</p><p>“If Antonia was still alive,” Rio said, tipping her bottle to the portrait of the sisters again. “She totally would. She was a freak.” She laughed, as if remembering something Antonia had done, and Agatha shook her head slightly, still unable to wrap her mind around Rio's distinct air of lightness.</p><p>“Can I ask you something?” she said finally. </p><p>Rio hummed, lips around the bottle.</p><p>“Why do you <em> really </em> do it? Dance at a strip club?” She held up a hand at Rio’s rolled eyes, and added, “I mean it, this time. I’m curious, and don’t say it’s for the money, because I know you better now, and I don’t believe that anymore.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth twitched upwards, and she leaned back on her elbows. Her hair brushed the top of the <em> Goonies </em> logo.</p><p>“I did start for the money. And there was no room to be serious about it. That was good for me.”</p><p>“And now?” Agatha said. The salt and pepper shakers faced each other on the counter, forgotten—Wile E. and Road Runner in their tiny, age-old standoff.</p><p>Rio looked down again, her fingers tapping the counter. Agatha watched her shoulder muscles twitch and flex.</p><p>“I don’t know; it’s hard to explain,” she said. “There’s… a moment.”</p><p>“A moment.”</p><p>“Yeah. It’s like…when someone’s looking up at me like I’m not even real.” She shifted her weight. Her fingers toyed with the bottle. “Especially women, because they look at me like they didn’t know they were allowed. Their eyes get kind of big, and their pupils dilate, and it’s like—it feels like for a second, maybe I actually <em> am </em> the fucking devil, or something, because it’s like I’m possessing them. I can feel it, even if I’m just standing there. I know I could destroy them, with just a look, or a touch.”</p><p>She paused, the wet label rubbing off in her hands.</p><p>“It’s a lot of power,” she said, finally looking at Agatha. Her eyes were dark, her voice low. “Knowing I can show someone the entire universe and take it away, in twenty minutes.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed. She felt every word of it pour down her spine, hot and slow. She wet her suddenly dry lips, and Rio’s eyes tracked the movement. </p><p>“What about the men?” Agatha said, her voice feeling strangely steady. She hadn’t meant to make a point, but now she was hurtling towards one. Strange, how that always seemed to happen. </p><p>"What about them?"</p><p>“When you <em>destroy</em> the men. They usually take that well?”</p><p>“They can’t all be gentlemen,” Rio said, her voice cold. “Nothing I can’t handle.”</p><p>Agatha’s gut twisted with a familiar combination of worry and anger.</p><p>“Rio,” she said, and she watched her face shutter closed. “You know how that sounds, right? Why are you acting like you can’t see it?”</p><p>“I have full control,” Rio said, crossing her arms. “I even so much as look at the door, and security is on me. <em>You </em> should know. That’s better than any regulated factory job."</p><p>She gestured vaguely, and Agatha got the distinct impression she'd made this argument before. Agatha caught the mistake that many had made before, but never yet Rio. Going head to head with Agatha required a little more than defaulting to autopilot. She felt it wash over her, the certainty of knowing something. Maybe it was the wannabe-Liv-Benson in her that had never truly died, in search of the injustice and hypocrisy. </p><p>Or maybe the feeling wasn’t anything so righteous or evolved. Because really, she was her mother’s daughter—a wild woman’s young turned wild woman. It wasn’t the methodical picking apart of a cross-examination. It was a flood of dangerous, deathly calm, the sound in her ears narrowing to her own pulse. It was the flash of headlights before the skunk lay motionless on its side, or the slow stalk to the edge of a cliff, and the lighting of a faulty fuse. </p><p>Rio watched her approach, arms still crossed, bottle clutched in her hand. Agatha reached past her, fingers curling around the edge of a cutting board, and then metal.</p><p>“That’s not control,” Agatha said, voice low, eyes scanning Rio’s face. Rio watched, unblinking.</p><p>“For example,” Agatha said. “This is your house, sort of. You're in charge, here.”</p><p>“Is that a question?” Rio licked her lips, smirking.</p><p>Agatha pulled her hand back, butter knife clutched in her fingers.</p><p>Rio’s eyes followed the steel. Agatha touched the flat tip lightly against Rio’s throat. She felt her swallow under it, and caught the hitch of her breath.</p><p>“That doesn’t make you <em> safe</em>, does it?” Agatha said. “What happens when you leave the club, and security is gone? What if someone’s waiting in the parking lot? Or outside your house? Or in your kitchen?”</p><p>“Is that someone you?” Rio’s eyes gleamed, shoulders squared. “Because you followed me to all three of those places, in case you forgot. And I can take <em> you</em>.”</p><p>Agatha tapped the blunt steel against her throat, twice. </p><p>“I wouldn’t be so sure,” she said, and felt the unwieldy edge in her voice pushing through. “You were a little rough around the edges after seventeen. The first time I got mugged, I was ten, and I didn’t lose a fucking dollar.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow at that, her interest sharpening. </p><p>“Agency without knowing the risks,” Agatha said, “without understanding what could go wrong, and when, and how—that’s <em> arrogance</em>.” </p><p>She reached for the beer bottle in Rio’s hand, grabbed the neck of it, and tugged lightly. Rio let go, fingers uncurling, and Agatha set it on the counter behind her.</p><p>“You let go because I wanted you to,” Agatha said.</p><p>She took Rio’s hand, fingers still cold from the bottle, and placed the knife in her palm. She pressed her fingers shut around it. Agatha breathed in, her nose almost close enough to brush Rio’s temple, the smell of sweat and pine filling her lungs. </p><p>She brushed a wood chip from Rio’s hair, smoothing it behind her ear. Rio shivered lightly under her touch. </p><p>“<em>Real </em> control,” Agatha murmured, “is borne from safety. Not stilettos.” </p><p>She stepped back, and Rio’s fingers twitched around the handle of the butter knife. Her throat moved, her eyes dark. Agatha couldn’t stop watching the looped Goonies script rise and fall with her breath, the cotton clinging to her chest, then lifting, again.</p><p>The wave of heat hit her suddenly, Rio’s throat still red where Agatha had tapped the flatware, her lips parted. Agatha felt the pulse of it everywhere, her chest, her face, her thighs, and the suddenly sharp ache between them. She was mesmerized by this version of Rio—silenced, speechless. <em> Affected</em>. </p><p>She should have made it to sixty-six days, Agatha thought, because this was definitely not the point she’d intended to make. Maybe if she'd made it to sixty-six, she’d be calmly laying out the pros and cons of the sex work industry, instead of being thirty seconds away from creative use of a tree stump, all because Rio was sweaty and disheveled and looking at her like <em> that</em>, at her mercy in a stranger’s kitchen. But Agatha had gone and named the problem, and now she had to swallow it in earnest. </p><p>Agatha had always understood the risks. When she was young, she would calculate the price of the furniture in her house, in case her mother never came home, to know what to sell first. Then, she learned the quick assessment of what every student would do in their seat at the turn of a phrase. When she was older, she sat in her doctor’s office next to a scared, quiet Josh, and asked for the exact success rate of a geriatric pregnancy in writing, down to the decimal. </p><p>And now, the risk was higher than any one of those things. Now, it was her sweet, tortured seven-year-olds—the ones in their seats, and the one pressing two thumbs into the buckle in her back seat.</p><p>She turned abruptly to look out the window, and took a deep breath, her pulse almost hurting where it hammered in her neck. She stood there in silence for a long minute, and finally, she felt the life of the kitchen start up behind her: the tear of a paper towel, the spray of cleaning solution, the smell of artificial lemon. </p><p>Rio was wiping down the counter, the Looney Tunes shakers no doubt collected and returned to their rightful place, and Agatha didn’t even get to see who won—broken-legged Road Runner, or Wile E. with his faulty stick of dynamite.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>For the second time that day, Agatha was staring down her kid in a living room, although this time the living room wasn’t her own. Nicky was on the sofa, legs and arms crossed.</p><p>“Why don’t you want to go home?” she said, aiming for patience, but landing somewhere near desperation. Weren’t seven year-olds supposed to want their beds at night? Hadn’t Nicky ever bothered to read <em> Your Seven Year-Old: Life in a Minor Key</em>? </p><p>“You said we were going to Disneyland,” he said, his tone just shy of the whiny pitch that made Agatha’s blood boil.</p><p>“<em>What</em>?” She stared at him. “That’s next month, baby. For your birthday, remember?”</p><p>“You said we were going today,” he said, his wail pulling tears into his eyes.</p><p>“No, I–” Agatha stopped herself, and sat down next to him. She took a breath, trying valiantly to calm her pulse. Kids were inconvenient, she reminded herself. Kids had tiny brains. Kids were cliché.</p><p>“You said we were going on a field trip,” he said.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, finally understanding. “We came on a little field trip <em>here</em>, to see Ms. V, and now it’s time to go home and go to bed.”</p><p>“No,” Nicky shouted, flinging a vintage-looking toy truck to the floor, still looking at her.</p><p>Agatha was hit with the sudden, overwhelming urge to cry. And not the kind where a few tears rolled placidly down her face, either. She wanted to wail, like Nicky was allowed to. To scream and thrash and curl into a ball on this beige carpet, and sob until her neck was wet with tears.</p><p>She wanted to know if she had been like this at seven. If it was <em> her </em> fault that Nicky switched indiscriminately between angelic and <em> wild child</em>. Her mother used to call her that—<em>wild child</em>—but hers had no trace of affection, laced instead with fury and disgust. The truth was that Agatha could barely remember seven, just flashes here and there: the couch in her apartment, pulling the peeling wallpaper by her bed when strangers were making loud and frightening noises in her living room and she couldn’t fall asleep. </p><p>But even with the bits and pieces she still remembered, she knew her mother had been right. She remembered screaming and scratching—even biting, sometimes. She would say what she meant, and raise hell right back to her mother. Until one day, when she just… didn’t anymore. When she decided at all costs that she wouldn’t become like her, that wild woman. </p><p>Agatha leaned forward and put her head in her hands, trying to force the feeling back down her throat. She rocked a little bit. She needed to get Nicky in the car and take him home, however the fuck she was supposed to do that with an unwilling body at nine o’clock in the pitch dark up a winding incline.</p><p>She felt a hand on her shoulder, and looked up. Rio was standing above them.</p><p>“Do you like rabbits?” she asked Nicky, and he looked at her curiously. Then, slowly, he nodded.</p><p>“Do you want to go look at one? He lives upstairs,” she said, holding out her hand. Nicky nodded again, excitement eclipsing his earlier tantrum, and put his hand in hers.</p><p>Agatha didn’t know whether to feel grateful for the save or annoyed that her plan was thrown even farther off course. She watched them walk to the stairs, her elbows still resting on her knees.</p><p>Rio glanced back at her. “Give me fifteen,” she muttered.</p><p>“You don’t have to—” Agatha started, and Rio just rolled her eyes, disappearing from view with Nicky in tow.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>After Agatha had collected herself and cleaned up the various toys Nicky had left in disarray, she climbed the stairs to the sound of Rio’s voice. The giggles she'd heard from downstairs had faded, and now it was just a low murmur of sound. She peeked into a room to the left, and pushed the door open a crack.</p><p>She was unprepared for the sight that hit her. It felt like when she'd fallen off of the monkey bars as a kid, straight onto her back, the wind knocked out of her for the first time as she lay there and thought she was dying. </p><p>Nicky was on the bed, curled on his side, his hand stroking a fluffy rabbit who seemed perfectly content to sit still. Nicky’s eyes were open, but just barely. And Rio was reading to him. </p><p>It shouldn’t have been so shell-shocking. Agatha had seen her read almost every day, and knew the lilt of her voice, low and musical. She knew the way her thumbs brushed the pages and held her place before she flipped. But this wasn’t the classroom of kids around the blue armchair under the paper tree—this was her son, curled in a bed, next to Rio.</p><p>Rio thumbed through a jacket-less book, her voice already lulling Agatha into the calm of the room, and she paused when she heard the door creak. Nicky yawned, and spotted her. </p><p>“Mama, come read with us.” His eyes were unfocused with near-sleep. </p><p>Agatha thought about telling him it was time to go, and then she swallowed her words. He looked so peaceful. She supposed carrying him to the car asleep would be easier than dragging him kicking and screaming. And then she supposed that had been Rio’s plan along. <em> Smartass know-it-all. </em></p><p>Agatha sat down on the other side of Nicky, propping a pillow behind her.</p><p>“Who’s your friend?” she murmured, nodding at the bunny.</p><p>“I named him Señor Scratchy,” he said. “Ms. V said he likes when people give him new names.”</p><p>Agatha looked at Rio, laughing at the obvious lie. Rio hid her grin behind the pages of the book.</p><p>“So, I know you guys are just reading,” Agatha said casually, and leaned her head back against the pillow. “But if anyone did happen to fall asleep here, I would be downstairs if you needed anything.”</p><p>Nicky looked at her, and then swung his head to Rio, as if she were the one being addressed. She smiled.</p><p>“Good to know,” she said, nodding seriously.</p><p>“Don’t let me interrupt." Agatha gestured to the book and pulled the blanket over Nicky.</p><p>Agatha listened to the sound of Rio's voice coating the surfaces of the room like honey, low and smooth and warm. She watched Rio’s lips form the words. She noticed the way her chest rose and fell, how she crossed one leg over the other. She noticed the edge of a bruise on her forearm, and her mismatched socks, and the gentle turn of the page. Her hard edge was gone, and left in its wake was <em>this</em>. Agatha watched the crease between her eyebrows disappear, and she supposed that even the most feral animals curled up in something soft at dusk or dawn.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t been this still in weeks. Her mind had been either occupied unintentionally with the needs of a small human, or intentionally with anything else to distract herself from the Rio of it all. And now, here they all were, half-asleep in a stranger’s bed, Nicky sandwiched between the two of them. He hadn’t been sandwiched at bedtime for a while now, she realized. </p><p>In some ways, he belonged to both of them, at least during the day. And now it was night, and Rio was still here. And Agatha didn’t want to make Nicky leave this bed full of people that loved him.</p><p>She sank lower and listened to the sound of the wind against the side of the house. She thought about tomorrow’s planned lesson about storms, and how the eye of a storm was caused by warm air, sinking in the middle. That’s how she felt here, in this house, on this bed. Warm and quiet, the swirling debris somewhere far out of view. </p><p>Rio’s thumb brushed against the page, and she yawned through a word. Her free hand stroked the rabbit’s ear. Agatha suddenly pictured them from above—a teacher, a dancer, a seven year-old, and a rabbit. They made as much sense together as the mismatched furniture in this house. </p><p>Then the wind rattled the window pane, and Agatha remembered reading beyond the second-grade science. She'd learned that the cause of the eye-in-the-storm phenomenon was not fully known. It was a mysterious combination of momentum and force—heat, pressure, and air in the right place at the right time. </p><p>Maybe that’s what all of this was—some unexplainable pressure system, pushing her closer and pulling her apart. She wanted to reach over Nicky and pet that damn bunny, too, and touch the skin on the back of Rio’s hand. To see what she would do—if she would stutter over her words, or look at her, or maybe even do nothing, because it felt so inexplicably <em> normal</em>, the three of them reading on a Sunday night. </p><p>“She was perfect,” Rio read. “I knew this the moment she emerged from my body, white and wet and wailing. Beyond the requisite ten fingers and ten toes, the beating heart, the lungs inhaling and exhaling oxygen, my daughter knew how to scream.”</p><p>Agatha knew this book—<em> the Language of Flowers. </em> Josh had gifted it to her one anniversary with a yellow rose, and she had loved the gift until she read the part where a yellow rose signified infidelity. After a shouting match, it became clear that he had picked up the book on his way home because he thought it had nice cover art.</p><p>She’d never finished the book, but Rio was reading somewhere near the end of it. And this one didn’t have any cover art, or a cover at all. She thought about yellow roses and Christmas trees, and Rio continued.</p><p>“She knew how to make herself heard. She knew how to reach out and latch on. She knew what she needed to do to survive. I didn’t know how it was possible that such perfection could have developed within a body as flawed as my own, but when I looked into her face, I saw that it clearly was.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand tangled in Nicky’s hair at Rio’s words, and she felt the tears push past her throat this time, and prick at her eyes. She loved him so fiercely sometimes, it overtook her—the love and the anger and the grief, and then the love again. Especially when they'd spent the day solidly at odds.</p><p>She'd gotten pregnant at thirty-five. She'd long thought there was something wrong with her, something irreparable—that she'd spent so long ironing out the creases inside her that it had actually worked. By the time she was in her twenties, she had a house and a husband and job. She was all smooth, clean, quiet lines. She didn't steal books from garage sales anymore, and she worried that her body didn't remember how to grow something wild. </p><p>She had tried, and hoped, and cried. She hated the women on the internet and the in the grocery store and on the sidewalk of her cul-de-sac that said it would happen when she least expected it. That it would bless her like an angel once she'd all but given up. </p><p>Agatha didn’t know how to give up. And so Nicky was born not in a gentle blessing of surprise, but a bitter haze of determination and relief. He was small and screaming and entirely uncontainable.</p><p>Now, on the bed, his eyes were closed, his breathing even. His hand lay next to the sleeping rabbit. Agatha felt the air on her face, and it was cool and wet, and she knew there were exactly two tears on her cheek, because she’d counted them spitefully as they fell.</p><p>Rio shut the book. She didn’t say anything, but Agatha felt her gaze like high beams, aimed directly at her crumbling resolve. She willed the tears to go backwards, back into her eye sockets, down her throat. Away. </p><p>She didn’t look at Rio. She kissed Nicky on the cheek, wiped her own, and stood. She didn’t stop until she made it all the way down the stairs, and past the beaded curtain that had surely belonged to Lilia. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Agatha heard Rio’s slow footsteps behind her, and then felt her phone vibrate in her pocket. <em> Saved</em>, for the third time that day. She held up the phone and jerked her head toward the living room. </p><p>Rio nodded. She was still watching her, concern etched across her face. Agatha realized she’d only ever seen Rio look at the kids that way. Now, that gaze was turned on her, wide-eyed and furrow-browed.</p><p>It felt… something. Not bad, exactly. People were concerned about her all the time—she did concerning things. But <em> Rio’s </em> concern was different. Agatha felt her guts rearrange themselves under her inquisitive brown eyes. She ignored the flutter in her stomach, and ducked through the doorway.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Agatha sat on the gold couch as Josh stalled in her ear. <em> This </em> was definitely not Lilia’s, she thought, fingers trailing over the silky fabric of an elegant pillow as Josh mentioned Nicky’s gymnastics class for the third time.</p><p>“Josh,” she interrupted. “You told me this already. If you wanted to talk to him, you should have just called earlier. He’s asleep.”</p><p>“No, that’s not why—” he paused. Agatha felt suddenly uneasy, her knees and shoulders locking.</p><p>“Has he said anything to you about Disneyland?” he asked.</p><p>“Well, yeah, every waking minute of the fucking day.” She rolled her neck, willing it to loosen. “Should I be listening for anything in particular?”</p><p>“Yes… No. I just, uh, wanted to give you a heads up,” he said. He cleared his throat, and sniffed.</p><p>“Spit it out."</p><p>“I started seeing someone.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. She didn’t know what she’d expected, but it wasn’t that. </p><p>“Great. Good for you,” she said finally. “No offense, but I don’t really need to know who you’re fucking around with.”</p><p>“No—look, it’s serious, Agatha.” He sighed. “She’s meeting Nicky next weekend. And I’m bringing her to Disney.”</p><p>Agatha’s fist tightened automatically, and the tassel from the pillow snapped off in her hand.</p><p>“You’re… <em> what</em>?”</p><p>“It’s been a few months, and she’s really great, and I think it would be a good chance for her to get to know him, you know?”</p><p>“You’re not even asking,” she hissed. “You’re giving me a <em> heads up</em>? <em> You </em> weren’t even fucking invited, Josh.”</p><p>“You offered.”</p><p>“I offered because—” Agatha stopped, her voice dropping to a heated whisper. “You know why I offered. I didn’t offer so that you can have a sunny getaway with your rebound.”</p><p>“Okay. Calling was a mistake,” Josh said. “Let’s talk about this in person.”</p><p>“Or, how about let’s not,” Agatha said, and jabbed the red button.</p><p>She slammed the phone face down on the couch beside her, and dropped her head into her hands. He already had another <em> something serious</em>. She was meeting Nicky. Nicky would have something whole, and two people in his bed at night.</p><p>She didn’t want to be stranded in Disneyland, watching her family slip away, unable to thrash and scream, like a mountain lion on a chain leash. And that was it, really. She wanted back what she'd lost: the biting and the scratching and the altogether wildness of <em> seven</em>.</p><p>Rio leaned in the doorway, taking her in. Her arms were crossed, the crease back between her eyebrows.</p><p>“I don’t want to talk about it,” Agatha said preemptively, and she felt the threadbare quality to her own voice. </p><p>“Okay,” Rio said. The single word was low and smooth, and it made Agatha’s shoulders drop an inch. </p><p>“What <em> do </em> you want?” she asked simply.</p><p>Agatha looked up at her messy hair and <em>Goonies</em> shirt and dark eyelashes. She wanted to stay here, in this dreamy, ambiguous place that wasn’t home school. She wanted to touch Rio’s face again, to know what it felt like under her fingertips when she yawned—if her jaw clicked, if it vibrated with noise. She wanted to remember what it was like before she’d learned to keep her hands to herself and her flailing limbs a secret. </p><p>“I want,” Agatha started, her voice hoarse, and it felt like a sound escaping her before she stopped. Maybe that was the end of the sentence. She <em> wanted</em>.</p><p>Rio stepped forward, until she was standing in front of Agatha, and Agatha tilted her head up to look at her. </p><p>She swallowed, and cleared her throat. </p><p>“I want the good weed.”</p><p>Rio didn’t respond—just raised her eyebrows, and then she was gone. It was so fast, Agatha wondered if she'd hallucinated the last minute altogether, but then she was back, a decapitated plastic squirrel in her hand. A battered-looking dime bag dangled from her index and middle finger.</p><p>“Fucking knew it,” Agatha muttered, and followed Rio out the back door.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>They were shoulder to shoulder on the cold dirt ground, backs against the side of the house, laughing silently. The door was cracked open in case Nicky woke up, but Agatha knew he wouldn’t. He slept the deepest on the days he fought the hardest. </p><p>They sat draped under their big jackets, the air just above freezing but enough to sting, and Agatha felt her nerve endings calm. Shadows of white pine towered above her, needles blue with frost, and she could see stars peeking through the branches. It felt like high school, slumped in a park next to a nervous, skinny boy whose hands shook when he rolled a joint. Except that Rio was anything but nervous, holding it between her index and middle like it was second nature.</p><p>Agatha watched Rio inhale, steady and slow. The orange glowed in time with her breath, her eyes fluttered shut, and the smoke spilled from her lips. </p><p>She hummed low, and Agatha felt the sound in her every bone. She’d heard that sound before, she realized, with Rio’s tongue vibrating against the inside of her mouth. </p><p>Agatha shut her eyes. “This isn’t nineties dirt pot, is it.”</p><p>“No,” Rio laughed. “No, these ladies keep current.” She looked at Agatha. “Wait, don’t tell me the last time you smoked weed was in the nineties.”</p><p>Agatha’s laughter spilled out of her, and she opened her eyes, rolling her head to look at Rio. </p><p>“Of course not." She took the joint from Rio’s hands. Their fingers brushed over the paper, and Agatha tried to focus on the simple act of pinching her fingers together. </p><p>She held back a cough. “2006.”</p><p>“<em>Shit. </em>What was the occasion?”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “E. Coli outbreak. Remember that? Or, fuck, I don’t know, you probably don’t? I was, like, <em> terrified </em> that I was going to die of e. Coli because I had just eaten a salad. And then I turned on the news and it was this huge thing. So Josh and I decided to get high and watch a movie to take my mind off of things. But the guy at Blockbuster was depressed because they'd just gotten, like, fifty copies of <em> Cars</em>, and no one was renting them because no one fucking went to Blockbuster anymore. So we felt bad and rented <em> Cars </em> and got shit-faced. Pro tip: do not watch a movie about talking Cars when you’re high and terrified of dying.”</p><p>Rio was already laughing, and Agatha joined her, shoulders shaking. The kind of laughter that was full and meaningless and all-consuming.</p><p>“You know the first movie I watched while I was high?” Rio said, still laughing. “<em>Girl, Interrupted</em>.”</p><p>“Jesus. Why?” </p><p>“My parents said it was <em> satanic</em>, but I’m pretty sure they just wanted to keep me away from Winona. So I stole the DVD from the library, and faked being sick to get out of church, so I could get high out of my attic window and just fucking look at Winona Ryder.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, feeling oddly endeared by the image of a young Rio hiding a DVD in her jacket, the way Agatha had stolen the book from the garage sale. She understood, though—Winona <em> was </em> hot.</p><p>Rio looked at her with a grin, raised eyebrows, and Agatha realized she had said that last part out loud. She considered that it was possible she'd gotten too high. She started laughing again, and Rio did, too.</p><p>“Shhh,” Agatha gasped, putting her hand over Rio’s mouth, and Rio laughed even harder. Their breath made clouds in the January air, and Agatha watched them, suddenly hypnotized by the contrast, white wisps against the dark sky.</p><p>Her hand fell to her side, back under the warmth of the jackets, and her fingers brushed against Rio’s thigh in the dirt. Cold against warm, mud against fleece.</p><p>“Ri-o,” she said, drawing out the word, as if she was testing the syllables for the first time.</p><p>Rio widened her eyes eerily, and grinned at her. She did look a little devilish sometimes, Agatha had to admit. </p><p>“A-ga-tha,” Rio replied.</p><p>Agatha watched her, her long fingers around the joint, lips parted, smoke filtering in, then out, above their heads. The flick of her thumb against the joint. The bow of her upper lip. </p><p>Agatha blinked slow, and her smile faded with the smoke, and her hand climbed all the way up from the dirt until it was resting on Rio’s thigh, just above her knee—the knee that had just decided one day it’d had enough. </p><p>She thought about the picture on the fridge, the one Rio had taken down, crutches and bandages in the sunset. She wanted to see the picture again—to <em> know </em> it. To know what Rio was thinking when it was taken, and why she still couldn’t look at it. She wanted to know how often she came here, if it was every Sunday or just the ones after Christmas. </p><p>When she was done at the club, women staring up at her like deer in the headlights in the middle of a dark highway—when she was done showing them the universe and taking it away, like she’d done to Agatha without a second thought—did she come here, where someone had her picture on the fridge, to lay down and pet a soft rabbit?</p><p>Agatha wanted to know. She <em> wanted</em>. </p><p>Her fingers tightened over Rio’s leg. </p><p>“The bunny,” she said, her voice feeling slow and sticky to her own ears. “What’s his real name?”</p><p>"Robert Redford.” </p><p>Rio seemed unfazed that Agatha’s hand was gripping her thigh, and through her weed-addled mind, Agatha felt annoyed. She wanted her to be a little fazed. </p><p>“People don’t know how much old lesbians <em> love </em> the Sundance Kid,” Rio said, and then she was laughing again, head tipping upwards.</p><p>Agatha laughed, too, because that was funny, and because her mother had liked Butch Cassidy and hated Sundance, so that apparently meant she wasn’t a lesbian, and if <em> she’d </em> had a rabbit, maybe it would have been named Paul Newman instead. It made perfect sense. She wished things made sense like this more often.</p><p>Agatha watched Rio laugh, her throat exposed, and Agatha opened her mouth to tell her all of it—her mother, Butch Cassidy, the rabbit she’d never had. </p><p>And instead, still half smiling, she heard herself say: “Why did you kiss me?”</p><p>Rio’s laugh faded in slow motion. She looked at Agatha, eyes dark and wide. Agatha’s gaze flitted between Rio’s eyes and her throat. Wanda once told her she looked like she was scanning people’s identity when she did that, but she couldn’t help it—there was too much to see at once. She watched Rio swallow, and then turn away again, setting her lips to the joint. </p><p>Agatha felt something out of reach, something akin to disappointment, having won the game of chicken she started in the first place. She moved her hand higher up Rio’s thigh, not really on purpose, but definitely not by accident, either. She felt the mountain lion strain against the chain leash, the links loosening.</p><p>Her fingernails caught on the fleece, and she scratched slowly, back and forth, fixated on the feel of the soft fabric and bits of leaf and grainy dirt under her fingertips. Maybe she’d imagined the words. <em> Why did you kiss me? </em>Maybe she hadn’t even asked it out loud.</p><p>She heard a soft thump and looked up. Rio's head was leaned back against the wall, and she was looking up at the trees above them in the dark night. She looked like <em> Rio</em>—sharp jawline, expressive nostrils, chaos brewing behind the clear brown of her irises and clean angles of her cheekbones. She looked like a movie poster. Agatha wondered if she looked like that too, if they looked like that together. Like Thelma and Louise, side by side in their car in the desert. Or Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, mid-run, four guns drawn between them. </p><p>That was too many guns for two people, she thought.  </p><p>She scratched her fingernails against Rio’s thigh, harder this time, and Rio’s eyes fluttered shut. The small, persistent clouds in the air came quicker, and Agatha thought: <em> it’s cold and your breath is giving you away.  </em></p><p>Agatha felt that she could watch the rise and fall of the draped jacket for another few hours, tracing slow patterns on top of black fleece, and then underneath it, watching the patterns escape in white, through Rio's lips and into the air.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said, and she said it half like a warning, half like a plea. Her lips were dry, and her voice was hoarse from the smoke, or maybe from all of it. And Agatha had never heard a better sound in her life than the way the syllables of <em>Agatha</em> rolled off of Rio’s tongue, like her name was water in the desert of the wild, wild west. </p><p>Butch Cassidy and Sundance died at the end, Agatha remembered suddenly. In a hail of bullets. Just like Thelma and Louise in their convertible, driving right off the edge of the cliff. Maybe it wasn’t enough, after all—four guns and a Ford Thunderbird.</p><p>“You kissed me,” Agatha said. This time she knew she didn’t imagine it, and this time it wasn’t a question. Rio looked at her, finally. </p><p>“I kissed you,” she said. </p><p>And then she looked at Agatha’s mouth, and said: “I’m sorry.” </p><p>Agatha’s hand stilled, and Rio’s thigh tensed, just briefly. It was like her body was primed for rhythm, for movement, and now it missed the repetition—the slow, lazy pressure, back and forth.</p><p>Agatha didn’t want to ask again. She didn’t want to hear why. She didn’t want Rio to say sorry to her mouth like she regretted what she’d done to it. Agatha just wanted to stay here, in the mind-numbing cold, with the mind-numbing weed, and her hand on Rio’s thigh, with no one feeling sorry at all. </p><p>An owl hooted somewhere over their heads. A pine needle landed on Agatha’s ankle.</p><p>“You bought new mugs,” she murmured, the gears in her mind drifting and slotting together in that satisfying way she'd forgotten in the years since 2006. “Uranium-free.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, and let out a half-laugh. “You’re so fucking high.”</p><p>Agatha looked at the small parts of her she'd come to know. The soft, dark hair at her temples, just in front of her ears. The tiny dimples that formed above the corners of her lips when she smiled, instead of in her cheeks. The mismatched socks on her feet. </p><p>“The devil wouldn’t do that,” Agatha said. “Replace the Fiestaware.”</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything. She watched the smoke curl into the sky, and Agatha watched her watch the smoke. Rio’s leg was still warm beneath her palm, and Agatha kept it there. She reached over Rio’s lap with her other hand, and pinched the joint from her fingers. </p><p>“God,” she said. “I’m so fucking high.” </p><p>She set her lips to the end.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>She didn’t remember when exactly it was that they moved inside, except that her fingers had gone numb. It couldn’t have been that late, but every time she tried to look at the chicken-shaped clock, its beak started opening and closing and she had to look away for fear that it was going to jump off the wall and come for her eyes.</p><p>She'd thrown her own plan out the door with the ashes on the patio. Nicky was asleep upstairs and she wouldn’t be able to drive until morning. <em> Monday </em> morning, as in, school.</p><p>She grabbed Rio’s arm in the living room, the warmth spreading back into her fingertips, and laughed uncontrollably until she managed to breathe enough to gasp: “We have <em> school </em> tomorrow.”</p><p>And then Rio covered her face with her hands, shoulders shaking, and whined, “Whyyyy would you say that right now?”</p><p>At some point, either five or fifty minutes later, Agatha realized <em> Goonies </em> was playing on the TV. She was sitting on the carpet with a stuffed animal in her hand. She looked into the pig’s face, its cartoonish eyes and snout, and wondered where it had come from. She smushed her face into the side of it, because it looked soft and pillowy, and felt a tug at her hair.</p><p>“Ow.” </p><p>“Stop moving,” Rio said, and then Agatha remembered that Rio was sitting on the couch behind her, braiding her hair. </p><p>She tried not to close her eyes, but the feeling of Rio’s fingers against her scalp was too therapeutic to resist. She felt her neck muscles loosening, until finally, she tilted her head all the way back, resting it against the couch between Rio’s knees, trapping her hands underneath her tangled hair. Rio stared at her, upside down, grinning slow. </p><p>“I only did one side,” she said, and Agatha focused on the shape of her upside down mouth when it moved.</p><p>“Do you like Disney?” Agatha said suddenly, her head feeling heavy.</p><p>“Like, the movies?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha murmured, still looking up at her. “The land.”</p><p>“Never been.” Rio dragged her hands through Agatha’s hair, freeing them, and Agatha felt a quiet moan escape her own lips at the feel of it. Her eyes fluttered shut.</p><p>“Come with us,” Agatha mumbled. “Next month.”</p><p>“I’m <em> never </em> letting you smoke weed again.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, eyes still closed, and the train of thought left her as Rio moved to the floor  and settled herself between Agatha’s outstretched legs. She shook her hair back.</p><p>“Do mine,” she said.</p><p>Agatha smiled, pulling her fingers through the dark hair. “I don’t want to brag,” she said, parting it gently. “But I’m <em> really </em> good at this.” </p><p>Rio slapped her thigh, her gaze focused on the TV. “Shut up. They’re about to go into the Inferno.”</p><p>Agatha smiled again, her hands twisting and pulling, and her focus narrowed, and then slipped.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>She didn’t remember finishing the braids, or the kids going into the Inferno, or falling asleep in the living room. </p><p>When she woke, it was still dark, and her mouth felt like it was stuffed with cotton. Her first thought was Nicky, before remembering where they were. Her second thought was that her back hadn’t hurt this badly since Nicky was a baby and his doctor said she was “carrying him too much.” As if she was supposed to believe that was a real problem, even though she could barely stand up straight enough in the doctor’s office to properly tell him off. </p><p>And the third thing she thought was that her arm was asleep, because Rio was laying on top of it. Agatha’s back pressed along the bottom of the couch, and Rio lay curved into her. Her hair was in two perfect braids, and Agatha suddenly remembered the day before in soft flashes of color and sound. The trees on the chopping block, the hot chocolate and beer, the bedtime story. The patio and the white pine, and the <em> Goonies </em> and the hair, and the weed. God, that new-age weed. </p><p>The guilt hit her hard, the thought of Nicky upstairs in a strangers bed while she fucked around and got <em> high </em> on a school night at the inexcusable age of forty-two.</p><p>She watched Rio’s side rise and fall, her free arm wedged between them on the carpet. Neither of them had moved onto the couch. </p><p>Her nose was almost touching the back of Rio’s neck, and she inhaled, softly. Her hand twitched. She wanted it to be last night again. If this were last night, maybe she would have reached out, and traced a slow line from Rio’s shoulder to her waist, and then lower, fingers wrapping tight around her hips and pulling them flush against her own. But she was sober, and her neck ached, and it was Monday morning.</p><p>She touched Rio’s hair instead, tracing one of the braids. The knots were even and tight, and Agatha may not have remembered doing them, but she recognized her own work. It filled her with a strange sense of sharp satisfaction, seeing the evidence left behind of her hands.</p><p>She thought of what Rio had asked her, if she remembered what it felt like when everything was <em> sparky </em> and <em> desperate</em>. But that was about Rio getting fingered by a cheerleader over a math textbook, not lying on the carpet next to someone who was far too old to be sleeping on the floor.</p><p>Still, she thought, her fingers lingering over the shell of Rio’s ear. She was starting to get the idea.</p><p>Her eyes drifted past Rio, past the doorway, to the kitchen window. The dark was turning slowly purple, and it was a Monday.</p><p>She needed to drive Nicky home, and get them both in a shower that would be mostly her blessed four-in-one (<em>“Shampoo and conditioner for both kids and adults!” </em>) and some quick, unpleasant scrubbing. And maybe she’d have time to throw out the marinara-soaked paper towels she knew were still on the floor.</p><p>This time, when she looked at the clock, her hand resting on the ridges of Rio’s left braid, the chicken stayed mercifully still. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>She carried Nicky down the stairs and took one last look at Rio. Agatha had wanted to put a blanket over her, but there were none in sight. So she left her lying there, curled up on the carpet, one arm under her head and mouth slightly open. </p><p>Nicky stirred in Agatha’s arms, and then clung to her tighter, burrowing his head into her neck. Agatha squeezed him back a little. She’d never say it out loud, but sometimes, it was so much easier to love him like this, heavy and dreaming.</p><p>She turned to the door, and caught a glimpse of the salt and pepper shakers in their place by the coffee maker. Road Runner was leaned up against Wile E., so the pepper wouldn’t spill out of his head when he inevitably toppled over. Wile E. stood solidly with his useless stick of dynamite, his dinner grown tired of the chase, and nestled tight against him.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Agatha walked up the winding path in the near-dark, stars still twinkling in the pre-dawn. Nicky was dead weight. Her thighs burned and her back still ached, seven years later. She said silent goodbyes to the dead trees in piles on her right, and felt the rustle of condolences from the live ones on her left.</p><p>Nicky’s thumb found his mouth as she put him in his booster, his eyes still shut. He was too old for that, but when he was asleep, he forgot everything that seven was supposed to be. And anyway, it wasn’t his job to know what he was supposed to be. Maybe it wasn’t really anyone’s job.</p><p>She drove out of Salem, the sky growing lighter over the horizon as trees thinned and the shapes of homes started to repeat themselves. Something bumped under her tires, and caught her eye in the rearview, in the middle of the otherwise empty road. She didn’t slow down, but she craned her neck to the mirror to see. It was brown and red and wet with recent death, small and unmoving. </p><p>With a jolt, she realized she hadn’t seen the damn <em> bunny </em> when she scooped Nicky from the bed. She hadn’t even remembered him at all, until this unidentified carcass on the pavement. She knew it probably wasn’t Robert Redford. And then, the further she drove, the knowing turned uncertain, until it evaporated to desperate hope. She said a little prayer just in case, that she hadn’t killed the soft thing. Not really to God, but to whoever looked out for the sister witches on a seventies farm. Maybe their god was more of a Joni Mitchell type. </p><p><em> And if I did kill him, Joni, </em><em>please let a seagull find him first, instead of anyone who’d recognize him</em>. </p><p>She signed her chest with a cross because she didn’t know what this god accepted in prayer. She hoped it worked for her, too—the god of good weed and french braids and <em> The Goonies</em>, who tended the life cycle of the Christmas trees, and rabbits, and skunks.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>It was seven forty-six a.m. before Agatha started to worry Rio hadn’t yet woken up. The teachers trickled out of the lounge, grumbling and slow to start after the beginning of the semester staff meeting. Agatha shuffled her papers, shaking her still-wet hair off of her shoulders. </p><p>Alice handed Agatha a steaming mug of coffee, and Agatha took it, surprised.</p><p>“You look like shit,” Alice shrugged.</p><p>Agatha scoffed, but it was half-hearted—she believed it. She glanced down at the dark liquid, and grimaced, holding it back out. </p><p>“This was a generous gesture,” she said, “but I don’t take my coffee in acid form.”</p><p>Alice eyed her. She didn’t touch the mug. “Cream and sugar make the hangover worse.”</p><p>“I’m not—”</p><p>“Heads up,” Alice mumbled. </p><p>She walked swiftly away, and when Agatha turned, Jen was standing in front of her with her arms crossed. </p><p>“Where is she?” </p><p>“Where’s who?”</p><p>“Agatha, stop it.”</p><p>Agatha raised her eyebrows. “Ooh, my full first name? Relax. It's the first day back. I’m sure she’ll be here any minute.”  </p><p>Jen looked at Agatha’s hair draped over her wet collar. “That’s not what I asked.”</p><p>Agatha stilled, meeting her eye. "Then why don't you try being a little more specific, Jennifer?"</p><p>As soon as she’d said the words, Rio appeared through the door in her winter jacket, cheeks flushed, breathless as if she had run from the parking lot. She had two to-go cups in her hands, faint splatters dotting lids and her sleeves.</p><p>Agatha almost dropped her mug of acid-coffee on the floor. Her stomach did a strange, swooping thing, and she felt a sudden, obscene urge to smile. Rio was still wearing the <em>braids</em>.</p><p>“I’m so sorry I’m late, Jen; I–” Rio slowed, taking in the near-empty room. She caught her breath, scanning Wanda, Jen, and Alice. Then, her eyes landed on Agatha. </p><p>“Hey,” she said, her shift in focus abrupt and undisguised. </p><p>Her voice was still rough with morning disuse, or maybe with the weed. Or, <em> fuck</em>, Agatha realized with a stab of guilt—maybe it was her asthma. She felt the full force of her own pure idiocy, showing up unannounced on Sunday night with Rio’s <em> inhaler</em>, and begging her to smoke. Agatha looked her over, scanning for damage she might’ve caused.</p><p>Her eyes fell to the two coffee cups again. She recognized the logo of a dog from the shop she had passed on her way home this morning. Her brain felt disjointed as she tried to put those simple facts together, and the realization crept in, embarrassingly slow: the second cup was for <em> her</em>.</p><p>Maybe Agatha had made a mistake, blindly assuming it went without saying that neither of them would mention last night. Not the impromptu trip, not the weed or half-confessions, not the sleeping together. Or rather—the <em> not </em> sleeping together, which felt even more incriminating. Because now here was Rio, <em> bringing her coffee</em>, late to the worst possible room at the worst possible time.</p><p>Agatha buried her face in the papers in her hand, trying to make herself as small as possible despite the fact that there were only four other people in the room. She glanced up once in polite greeting, like she didn’t want to interrupt Rio’s apology, which was absurd because Rio had already interrupted herself in the most conspicuous, ridiculous, insane way possible.</p><p>Rio blinked, her eyes rising above the obvious fog for a second, and looked around again. “Uh, <em> everyone</em>. Hey—everyone.” She waved once in awkward, broad greeting. </p><p>Agatha suppressed the urge to climb under the desk.</p><p>“I had a pet situation,” Rio said, keeping her eyes firmly on Jen and Wanda this time. “My rabbit got out, but I found him. Little bastard.”</p><p>“Thank fucking god,” Agatha muttered, forgetting herself for a moment.</p><p>“Nice braids,” Jen said. “You could give Agatha a run for her money.”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks turned a distinct shade of pink, and Jen eyed the coffee in Rio’s hand.</p><p>“Is that a peace offering?”</p><p>To her credit, Agatha noted, Rio only hesitated for a second. </p><p>“It won’t happen again,” she said, handing over the cup. “I swear.”</p><p>“Don’t sweat it. Everyone gets one." Jen took a sip of the coffee and blinked, her eyes widening. "Hell no, take this back. I think I just got diabetes."</p><p>Rio took the coffee and ducked her head, making her way to Agatha. She set both cups wordlessly on the desk.</p><p>“I see you kept the hair,” Agatha said under her breath, handing her the stack of papers. </p><p>Rio grabbed it, and narrowed her eyes. “I see you didn’t.” </p><p>“You only did one side.”</p><p>“You didn’t let me <em> finish</em>.” Rio said, indignant, and Agatha bit back her smile again. Indignant Rio was hard not to smile at.</p><p>“Well <em> you</em>–” </p><p>Agatha caught a glimpse of Jen out of the corner of her eye, watching them. The sudden buoyancy in her chest sank to her stomach. </p><p>“You have toothpaste on your face,” she muttered, and left the coffee on the desk. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>On rainy days, the cafeteria felt too full. Teachers flanked the sides of the room, pretending not to notice most of the things they did. And Agatha leaned heavily against a cement pillar, the ache in her back and poor night's sleep compounded by the chaos. Her hair caught on a plastic poster taped to the pillar, and she untangled it, glancing at the rules written in comic sans. God bless Sharon.</p><ol>
<li><em>Walk, don’t run.</em></li>
<li><em>Clean up after yourself.</em></li>
<li><em>Say your “pleases” and “Thank you’s.”</em></li>
</ol><p>Since her second day of school at twenty-one, student-teaching with Vinegar and the picture of the dead skunk, she'd always thought teaching itself fairly simple. Carved within in structure and routine, she’d felt free to create her own rules, though she’d never named them in comic sans, or laminated them against a wall.</p><ol>
<li><em>Tell kids the truth; they can handle it.</em></li>
<li><em>To make them laugh, just start laughing. </em></li>
<li><em>Sitting next to a kid in their wild and moody darkness is much more effective than turning on a light.</em></li>
<li><em>Tell girls to stop saying sorry so much.</em></li>
<li><em>Sometimes, say you’re sorry.</em></li>
</ol><p>The Rules had served her for twenty years with no major hiccups. But motherhood was a different story altogether, and personhood, even worse. If she had to pick one problem, it would be that the authors of <em> Your Seven Year-Old: Life in a Minor Key </em>stopped writing books after sixteen.</p><p>She was still <em> herself </em> at sixteen, unapologetic and deliciously inappropriate. But <em> seventeen </em> was when her life changed, when she watched <em> Good Will Hunting </em> in Brandon’s basement and stole the book from the garage sale. Seventeen, too, was when Rio fucked a cheerleader, and got kicked out of her house, and fell into a family of ex-dancers, farmers, and soothsayers. Seventeen was when Things started to Happen, to everyone, apparently. And yet, there was no book for seventeen.</p><p>There was no book for forty-two, either. She looked at Rio, three tables over, opening a carton of milk for a first-grader. She handed it to him, and another one asked her to cut his hot dog into pieces. She obliged him, too. </p><p>Agatha remembered last night suddenly, Rio snuggled next to Nicky and Robert Redford the rabbit, her voice soft and fingers stroking fur. Soft edges, willing and easy. She’d let Agatha take the beer bottle from her hand, and replace it with a knife, no questions asked. No caution. All give. </p><p>Rio stood there now, in the crowded lunchroom, again with knife in hand—plastic, this time. She made it halfway through the hot dog, and her eye caught Agatha’s. Agatha wasn’t sure what her own face was doing, but she figured it was doing something, because Rio’s expression turned from amusement to intensity, the knife frozen in her hand.</p><p>Of course, Agatha had no rules for <em> this</em>—for the way Rio looked at her, with a knife in her hand. The way her feet rubbed together automatically when she read aloud in bed. The way she curled up fetal in her sleep, against Agatha’s chest, like a burrowed animal on the living room floor. </p><p>Before yesterday, or maybe before today, right now, she would have argued that Rio was right—that one night in June, Rio had destroyed her with just a look. But now, it was more than half a year later, and she was locking eyes with Rio across a lunchroom.</p><p> </p><p>She'd known, when she was twenty-one, about the life cycles of rodents, scavengers, and common reptiles. On the day she drew the roadkill, she knew that there were two reasons Lucille’s pet gecko had stopped eating the frozen, dead crickets she was feeding him. </p><p>The first was that geckos stopped eating when they shed their skin. This was a temporary discomfort, and if this was the cause, he would be just fine.</p><p>The second, more unfortunate option, was that the hands of evolution hadn’t meant for him to live in a glass tank with a lid and a heat lamp. He didn’t recognize the frozen things as prey at all. He'd be looking for something warm and alive, and only remember something he'd never really known—the instinctual urge to scramble and run, to chase the signs of life across the desert rocks, under the wide open sky.</p><p>And now, Agatha knew about the life cycle of a Christmas tree, too. She knew that on the other side of a tree trunk, split by an axe, lay the soft mulch that made way for saplings and blooming azaleas. </p><p>Now they were back at school, where Agatha had lived since she was twenty-one, and where all of a sudden, her beloved routine felt like four walls with a lid. And looking at Rio across the heads of her seven year-olds, she understood that Rio hadn’t destroyed her at all. She'd broken Agatha open completely, cracked the hard ground of her and molded the clay underneath—heat, pressure, and air in a mystifying combination.</p><p>Rio was still looking at her over the tables, braids dangling too close to the open milk carton, and the kid was starting to get upset that she hadn’t finished cutting up the hot dog. Agatha swallowed, and once more felt it in her stomach—the twisting and twirling and light-spotting that meant that <em> this </em> was something important. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>When Sunday night turned to Monday morning and the forest thinned to fences, the rabbit, Robert Redford, returned to his cage. He knew he should be grateful, not lying on the side of the road. But every night from now on, as his beloveds placed him gently into the hutch, he'd rustle back and forth: two feet left, two feet right.</p><p>He'd think about escaping up the winding path, the one that he had seen from the window, and he'd know that he could choose one of only two. One: escape, and risk his guts splayed open on the side of the road. Or two: resign to be restless for the rest of his life, after knowing the softness of a new name, and a bedtime story, and the slow, gentle stroke of the devil’s loving hand.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p>“Just because you are soft doesn't mean you are not a force. Honey and wildfire are both the colour gold.”</p>
<p>
<strong>― Victoria Erickson</strong>
</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat on an exam table, bare-assed in a scratchy gown, staring at a woman who was most certainly not her doctor. The woman crossed her legs in the rolling chair, black stilettos gleaming. It didn’t bode well for common sense—a doctor in pencil heels.</p><p>“I’m not big on substitutes.” She eyed the woman’s immaculate ponytail. “I would have just rescheduled with Dr. Foster.”</p><p>She crossed her arms for emphasis, and the damp tissue tore beneath her thighs.</p><p>“Jane and I are old friends,” the woman said, her smile gentle. “My name is Pepper Potts. It’s wonderful to meet you.”</p><p>“You’re fucking with me,” Agatha half-laughed. “You’re a gyno named <em> Dr. Pepper</em>?”</p><p>“Guilty—although I’m a Diet Coke girl, myself. I see you had your last appointment not too long ago. What brings you in today?”</p><p>“As I told your <em> old friend, </em> Jane,” Agatha said, “my cycle’s been off for a while. She said to come in the next time I go more than eight weeks without my period. It’s been eight. And four days.”</p><p>The typing grew louder. Agatha’s shoulders tightened with each keystroke.</p><p>She nodded at the stethoscope draped around Pepper’s shoulders. “Why do you need that?” she muttered. “To check if my vagina’s still alive?” </p><p>Pepper was still smiling, still typing, and still unruffled. Agatha assumed she’d dealt with her share of snarky assholes. Agatha tried to remind herself this was a perfectly normal woman who was just doing her job.</p><p>Agatha hated going to the doctor. She hated the way the walls were always some color other than white, and always ugly. The first time she remembered going to the doctor, she was eleven. She’d had the worst kind of flu—fever, hives, hallucinations. Evanora had finally tossed her in the back seat when she wouldn’t stop screaming, convinced she could see ghosts emerging from the walls of her bedroom with their arms outstretched. She didn’t remember much from the visit itself—green walls with peeling fish stickers, and a man handing her a pill she promptly threw up onto the floor.</p><p>In college, her first gynecologist had suggested “having more sex” as the solution for her debilitating period cramps. With no prior knowledge of what qualified advice as medically sound, she’d believed him—until she tried it, and promptly thrown up in her bathroom from the pain. She did not believe him, or speak to him, again.</p><p>By the time she was thirty-three, she’d seen five different fertility specialists. All of them had x-rayed and imaged and probed, and then sat her down to tell her it wasn’t her fault. It had to do with the coincidental shape of something inside her—a tube or cavity she refused to acknowledge—that made it sound like it was <em> very much her fucking fault. </em></p><p>The last doctor, a balding man with stale coffee-breath, had leaned in after Agatha’s fifth desperate question, and said definitively: “At your age and with your history, it is likely impossible that you will ever naturally get pregnant.”</p><p>Three for three, she’d thrown up in the wastebasket by the door. By then, she’d stopped bothering to feel bad about it.</p><p>“Any chance you could be pregnant?” Pepper was saying.</p><p>“No,” Agatha almost laughed. Not even by her own miracle hand.</p><p>“On the questionnaire,” Pepper said, glancing down. “You marked both ‘yes’ and ‘no’ for sexually active. Can you tell me more?”</p><p>“Oh, I just…” Agatha felt her cheeks flush. “I was, and now I’m not.”</p><p>Pepper nodded earnestly. “And you’re implying that your last sexual activity did not include ejaculation from which you could have gotten pregnant?”</p><p>“Jesus, buy me dinner first,” Agatha muttered. “Fine. The last time I had sex was three and a half months ago. We used a condom, he came, I came, I laughed, I cried, I went home, and I haven’t had sex with a man since.”</p><p>“Ah. Thank you for clarifying.”</p><p>Agatha could see the hint of amusement in the line of Pepper's mouth for a fleeting second. </p><p>“You said, ‘with a man,’” she noted. “Have you been sexually active at all in the last few months, or just not with men?”</p><p>Agatha blinked. She hadn’t meant to say that.</p><p>“It’s perfectly okay if you have—”</p><p>“No,” she said finally, clearing her throat. “No one.” </p><p>Pepper’s voice was softer now. “Is that something you’d like to discuss further?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha repeated.</p><p>“Okay.” Pepper shifted seamlessly. “Have you noticed any other symptoms? Sometimes there are more clues to what might be going on.”</p><p>“No symptoms." Agatha crossed her arms.</p><p>Pepper nodded, pen tapping her chin. “Irritability?” </p><p>“Cute.”</p><p>“I meant it. Trouble sleeping or eating, mood swings, exhaustion… anything like that?”</p><p>Agatha balked. “I teach second grade. So, yes. Constantly.”</p><p>“All of them?”</p><p>“It’s been an eventful year.”</p><p>“I’m sorry to hear that.” The genuine concern on Pepper's face threw Agatha for a loop. Her anger rolled off of this woman like water on wax. </p><p>“Any hot flashes? Changes in libido?”</p><p>A slow churn started in Agatha's gut. “Where is this going?” </p><p>“Is that a yes?” </p><p>Agatha ground her teeth. “Yes.”</p><p>“Okay,” Pepper set down her clipboard. “I’ll send you down to the lab before you leave to rule out anything serious.” She paused, and folded her hands together over her lap.</p><p>“Have you heard of perimenopause?”</p><p>“<em>What</em>?” Agatha hopped right off of the table, the paper sticking to her thighs. She grabbed it awkwardly, trying to separate it from where it had welded to her skin. </p><p>“I’m not in <em> menopause</em>,” she spat. “I’m forty-two.”</p><p>“The average age window of menopause starts at forty-five,” Pepper said calmly. “<em>Peri </em> means <em> before</em>.”</p><p>“I know what <em> peri </em> means,” Agatha snapped, even though she didn’t, not really. </p><p>Pepper handed her a piece of paper from a folder Agatha hadn't noticed. She wondered if Pepper and Dr. Foster had been planning this the entire time, like some kind of third-party intervention for the especially-repressed.</p><p>“I am more than happy to explain all the nuances of perimenopause, and introduce options to manage symptoms. Or, I can send you home with this pamphlet, and call you in a week to discuss it. I usually prefer the former, but Jane seemed positive you would not.”</p><p>Agatha snatched the pamphlet from her hand. Only when Pepper had risen, hand on the doorknob, did Agatha clear her throat. She didn’t look up.</p><p>“So these… symptoms,” Agatha said, skimming the cover. She kept her voice even, casual. “This could all just be a <em> condition</em>?”</p><p>“Think of it more like puberty,” Pepper smiled apologetically. “Or, like you said, it could be the result of a high-stress year. Unfortunately, that’s about all the clarity I can give you at the moment.”</p><p>“But it <em> could </em> be?” Agatha said again, thumbing the smooth paper in thought. “Hormones.”</p><p>“It could be.” Pepper’s voice was gentle. Her hand loosened on the door. “Do you want me to walk you through the information?”</p><p>“No,” she said quickly. “I’m familiar with homework.”</p><p>Pepper smiled. “Of course. Call if you need anything, or have any questions at all. You’re in excellent health, okay, Agatha?”</p><p>She barely heard the door close. Her mind was spinning. Maybe she wasn’t crazy. Maybe she’d literally been crawling out of her skin for the last nine months. The divorce, the school board meeting, the PTA moms, and of course, <em> Rio</em>. The fucking <em> Rio </em>of it all. Her face. Her dark, slow smile. Her fucking eyes.</p><p>The reaction was immediate. Agatha’s skin prickled. Easy heat flared up her neck and under the gown, sweat gathering between her breasts and thighs<em>. </em></p><p>
<em> Hot flash, check.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Changes in libido, check.  </em>
</p><p>She wanted to call Dr. Pepper back in the room and press her hand to the sweat on her own brow in evidence. She would shake her by the shoulders and demand a more definitive answer—or better yet, a solution.</p><p>
<em> Irritability, check. </em>
</p><p>She picked up her jeans, finger hooked through a belt loop, and stared at the poster across from her. She looked at the drawing of the human-sized skeleton and counted the true ribs, differentiated from the false. The true set connected directly to breastbone, the false by cartilage borrowed from another, or not connected at all. It was unsettling, the thought of a free-floating bone. </p><p>Here she was again: growth measured by the failings of her body, notched into her spine like height marks on a doorway. In yet another doctor’s office, in the late stages of winter and middle stages of perimenopause, Agatha accepted that the way she felt about Rio was merely a medical mystery. Nothing more. </p><p>She dressed and rolled up her sleeves, ready to walk downstairs and offer up her blood. Her cells were surely lining up at the wound, ready to expose the truth of her: the ridges of Rio’s braids, and the shape of her asleep on the living room floor. Agatha’s stomach twisted and fluttered, almost like when she’d been carrying Nicky. She wished that this, too, had been something alive inside her, kicking to be freed.</p><p>She locked eyes with the skeleton, with its empty sockets and its floating ribs, and uncrumpled the pamphlet. She tucked it into her back pocket. And she told herself that in time, like all symptoms of a temporary condition: the flailing of an unborn baby, or the stuttering standstill of a uterus—this one, too, would fade.</p><p> </p><hr/><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>One week later, Agatha found herself parked outside Rio’s apartment for the second time. She’d called four times and laid a hand on the horn for a full minute, until a man from a third-story window had threatened to dump a can of paint on her car. Then she’d sat still and picked at her thumbnail until it bled.</p><p>Her stomach cramped at the thought of the week ahead, surrounded by people who knew her best. It felt like stepping out of a seventh-grade closet after seven minutes in heaven: cheeks on fire, everyone knowing exactly what she’d done.</p><p>She should have pretended she’d never asked Rio to come to Disneyland at the hands of that godforsaken weed. And more importantly, when Nicky asked if he could invite Ms. V on his birthday trip, she most definitely, certainly, unequivocally should not have said: “I already asked her.” </p><p>Now, having backed herself into the corner of providing Nicky the eighth birthday of his dreams, Agatha once again found herself at the top of the rain-slick staircase, knocking on Rio's front door with too much force. </p><p>It swung open, and Agatha was met by the sight of Lilia in a pink robe, curlers in her hair.</p><p>“It is nine in the morning, on a Saturday,” Lilia announced. “Surely you’re not here to ask me where Rio is.”</p><p>“It’s nine-<em>thirty</em>,” Agatha corrected, brushing past her.</p><p>“Rio!” she yelled down the hallway. “If you’re not out in two minutes, I’m leaving without you.”</p><p>She tapped her foot, eyes scanning the colorful furniture. Magazines still covered every surface. She caught Lilia’s slow shake of the head.</p><p>“What.” </p><p>“You have the impatience of someone much younger.” Lilia eyed her. “Have you considered that it sometimes might behoove you to wait just a <em> little </em> longer than you think you need to?”</p><p>“No, it does not <em> behoove </em> me. I waited thirty minutes.” Agatha waved her phone in the air. “Why does Rio even have a phone when she never seems to be using it? The two of you together, Jesus—you might as well be on the fucking moon. <em> RIO</em>!”</p><p>Her voice echoed. When Agatha turned, she found Lilia still watching her. </p><p>“Has anyone ever told you it’s incredibly irritating when you stare like that?” </p><p>“There’s a lot more to see than the last time you were here.” Lilia’s voice was suddenly soft. “The moon card hasn’t been gentle, has it?”</p><p>“The <em> moon </em> is a ball in the sky,” Agatha said slowly. “And you know what, since you’re so desperate for feedback—I’m about to spend four days with my ex-husband’s new girlfriend, who teaches meditation classes <em> for fun</em>. And Wanda keeps looking at me like I’m one gentle breeze away from disintegrating, which I fucking might be. And now, Rio—”</p><p>Her breath caught, and she shook her head, eyes fixing on the beaded curtain. She remembered the matching one from the house in the woods. </p><p>“Next time,” she continued, quieter, “any of that would have been a little more helpful to know than some utter fucking bullshit about lobsters and outer space.”</p><p>“You know, meditation might do you some good."</p><p>Agatha shook her hands in speechless anger and turned to the hallway. She’d waited long enough.</p><p>“Rio!” she shouted, banging on her door. “Get up.”</p><p>Agatha stared at the familiar assortment of signs, and found an inch of amusement peeking under her frustration at the '<em>Beware of Dog!'</em></p><p>“Be careful,” Lilia called. “She’s alarming when woken.”</p><p>With no time for Agatha to consider what that meant, the door opened outward, and Rio slipped through the crack. She shut it behind her and glared. Agatha’s frustration melted at the sight of her—half-asleep and scowling, hair wild, toothbrush dangling from her mouth. </p><p>“I’m here, I’m awake,” she grumbled around the toothbrush, her voice gravelly. “Be… <em> quieter</em>.”</p><p>Even less of a morning person than she’d realized, Agatha noted.</p><p>“See?” she called back to Lilia. “Impatience pays.”</p><p>She turned to Rio, now slumped heavily against the door. Her hand was unmoving on her toothbrush, and her eyes had fallen shut. Agatha slapped her shoulder, and Rio’s eyes flew open, her hand resuming its automatic movement. Agatha bit back a smile.</p><p>“Is that what you’re wearing on the plane?” Rio garbled, eyeing Agatha’s purple sweater and gray slacks. Agatha crossed her arms, and looked down at herself. </p><p>“What’s wrong with it?” </p><p>“Nothing,” Rio said, her voice still heavy with sleep. “It looks so soft.”</p><p>As if in a daze, she reached out, feeling the soft, purple cashmere at Agatha’s rib. Agatha bit her lip to keep from snorting, and ignored the distracting sensation of her warm hand through the fabric. A drop of toothpaste rolled down the side of Rio's chin, and Agatha’s fingers twitched at her sides. She imagined pushing Rio back against the door, and licking it off, slow and deliberate. She thought of how the mint and grit would feel under her tongue, then between Rio’s lips.</p><p>She watched it land in the center of a white tank top so thin, she half expected it to tear under the single drop. The fabric stretched loosely across Rio’s chest, nipples poking through underneath, and Agatha’s fingers twitched again.</p><p>She looked up, nowhere near fast enough. Rio was already smirking, looking remarkably more awake. Agatha was suddenly light-headed from all of the sage, and not for any other reason.</p><p>“Are you packed?” She asked, and felt incredulous at the lack of backbone in her own demand. </p><p>“No.” Rio’s voice was low and teasing.</p><p>Agatha took a breath. “I am so, incredibly, not in the mood to be fucked with.”</p><p>Rio was still looking at her with that half-smirk, brushing lazily. Agatha opened her mouth to throw another weak, biteless threat, but before she could, the door flew open behind Rio. Rio’s chest slammed into hers, sending a jolt of pain through her shoulder. The toothbrush bounced on the carpet.</p><p>Their chests were pressed together, and Rio braced her arm on the wall next to Agatha’s head in a sudden, cruel reversal of her impromptu fantasy.</p><p>“Ow,” Rio said, disgruntled, and Agatha caught a flash of her mouth full of toothpaste, which should have been disgusting, and somehow, was... not. Rio stepped back, and Agatha realized too late that the door had opened from the inside.</p><p>A woman had slipped into the hallway with them. She picked up the toothbrush, and Agatha watched as she handed it to Rio.</p><p>“Sorry.” The woman smiled, then glanced at Agatha. “Uh…hi.”</p><p>“Fuck, sorry,” Rio mumbled, her mouth still full. “This is—fuck, I have to—” She dashed inside, and Agatha was left staring at the woman in the hallway.</p><p>She had long, dark hair, and smooth skin—not a wrinkle or stretch mark to be seen. She was still smiling. Agatha imagined her uterus functioned flawlessly. The woman was squinting now, and Agatha felt the odd need to squint at her back. It wasn’t just a pleasant face, was it? No—it was a distinctly familiar one.</p><p>Before she could open her mouth, Rio was back, panting.</p><p>“Sorry. Agatha, this is Kate. Kate, Agatha.” She blinked, and rubbed her nose. “I have to go to the airport,” she added to Kate. Agatha wondered if this was the first she was hearing about it, or if they had talked about it before, like last night, in Rio’s bed, when they were—</p><p>“Right,” Kate said, still staring at Agatha. Her nose crinkled slightly in thought, and the action sparked a sudden, clear image. The crinkle of the nose, the big eyes, the dark, wavy hair, the friendly smile—she <em> knew </em> this girl. She froze, and the hallway narrowed around her.</p><p>“Kate,” she said faintly. “As in… Katie Bishop?”</p><p>“Oh my god,” Kate exclaimed, clapping her hands together. “I <em> knew </em> you looked familiar! Mrs. Harkness, right?”</p><p>Agatha clutched the wall behind her on instinct to keep herself upright. </p><p>“You two—” Rio trailed off, the realization settling in her now wide-awake eyes. “Oh.”</p><p>"This is so crazy," Kate continued, oblivious to Agatha's impending death. "How have you been? Are you still teaching?"</p><p>"She's my—" Rio gestured to herself, then to Agatha. </p><p>"I’m her—" Agatha cleared her throat. "Yes."</p><p>“Wow, I knew you worked at a school,” Kate said, grabbing Rio’s arm, “but you never told me where! This is, like, my favorite teacher of all time.”</p><p>"Oh my god," Rio said, the words caught between a choke and a laugh. "I have to go, Kate.”</p><p>“Yeah, no worries dude. Last night was great, I'll catch you when you get back.” Kate turned to Agatha. “So great seeing you again, Mrs. H!"</p><p>Agatha turned slowly to Rio, and she felt her eye twitch. <em> "Dude?" </em> she mouthed.</p><p>"We’re leaving," Rio said, walking quickly to the front door.</p><p>Agatha started after her in pure spite, and stared as Rio stuffed her feet into her sneakers. She grabbed a black suitcase next to the door.</p><p>"I packed last night," Rio said, tongue in cheek on her way out.</p><p>Agatha stood open-mouthed in the living room, hands spread at her sides as if she could physically find her balance. Lilia sipped her tea, not bothering to hide her smug smile.</p><p>"You could have waited ten more minutes," she said.</p><p>Agatha flipped her off with both hands, and slammed the door.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The flight was delayed by forty-one minutes—the exact amount of time Agatha had spent picking up Rio—and she made a mental note to piss in Lilia’s miracle tea at the very next opportunity. Rio had fallen asleep in the car approximately five seconds after Agatha had turned the key, and she spent the ride stewing in silence. A couple times, she almost cranked the radio just to ruin Rio’s morning in return. But then, she’d looked at her socked feet on the dash, and her seat leaned all the way back, and begrudgingly lowered her hand. </p><p>Agatha kept to her vow of silence into the shuttle ride from the parking lot. She squinted through the tinted window and counted the black cars, then the people that were crying. Then, anyone that was crying while standing next to a black car. And finally, when she’d run out of things to count, she said:</p><p>“You didn’t <em> have </em>to come, you know.” </p><p>For a second, she wondered if Rio had heard, but when she turned her head, Rio was looking at her incredulously.</p><p><em>"You </em> invited me. And then Nicky invited me. And then Wanda invited me.”</p><p>“<em>Wanda </em>invited you?” Agatha said, jaw dropping.</p><p>Rio settled back in the plastic seat, shutting her eyes again. “She wanted me to meet some people at that school she used to work at.”</p><p>“So you’re coming to Disneyland to <em> network</em>.”</p><p>Rio hummed. Agatha felt the annoyance flare hot in her chest again. She had the overwhelming urge to grate against something sharp until it softened. To rub back and forth, and sand her down smooth. The feeling was so distantly familiar, sharp and twitchy in her fingertips. The word <em> mischief </em>came briefly to mind.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help it. She leaned as close as she could to Rio’s ear without touching, and blew, hard. Rio jerked upright in her seat, hood flying off. Her suitcase rolled across the bus aisle, bumping an elderly woman in the knee, and Rio lunged for it. She muttered apologies and turned a thunderous face to Agatha, who tried and failed to hide her grin. Rio dropped back in her seat, and sulked.</p><p>“Has anyone ever told you you’re an asshole in the morning?” she said, and Agatha turned her head to the window to laugh.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Agatha spent the first half of the flight staring out the window with light dread, watching for sparse patches of green farmland between the brown. When she couldn’t bear to sit still for another second, she did her best to distract herself. She tapped through the in-flight movies, pulled at a thread on her sweater sleeve all the way to her armpit, and offered unsolicited help with Billy’s puzzle book.</p><p>After the third time she shook her thumbnail out in pain and put it right back between her teeth, Wanda looked at her knowingly.</p><p>“You’re going to be <em> fine</em>,” she said over Billy’s head.</p><p>“She teaches <em> meditation</em>,” Agatha gritted out, pointing to a word in the word search.  “Good luck getting Nicky to sit still for more than forty seconds.”</p><p>“I don’t see it,” Billy said, squinting at the page.</p><p>“It says ‘ASS,’” Agatha said, pointing again. “A-S-S.”</p><p>“No it does not,” Wanda said. She took Billy’s pen. “It’s <em> ‘GRASS</em>.’”</p><p>Agatha squinted at it. “Oh. Yeah.”</p><p>Wanda laughed, and leaned her head sideways against the seat. She scrunched her face. “This might suck for you.”</p><p>“Thanks for bringing your small army while I’m army-less.” Agatha rested a hand on Billy’s head, and watched him as he circled <em> LION</em>.</p><p>“We’re your army, too,” Wanda said, and looked down the aisle. “And here comes your second-in-command.” </p><p>It was Rio, strolling towards them, hands stuffed in her pockets. Agatha stuffed the cheap, plastic headphones in her ears, and grabbed the first magazine her fingers touched in Billy’s seat back pocket.</p><p>She heard Wanda clear her throat.</p><p>“Hey, did you want to— Okay, kid—let’s go see how Dad and Tommy are doing.”</p><p>Agatha felt Billy unbuckle beside her, and kept her eyes firmly on the worn issue of <em> National Geographic Kids </em>in her hands as Rio dropped into the aisle seat.</p><p>“Hey,” she said, and Agatha looked up. She gestured to the headphones in her own ears, and mouthed, ‘can’t hear.’</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched, and she leaned over. She reached for something by Agatha’s knee, and held up the loose end of the headphone cord. Wordlessly, she plugged it into the screen. Agatha tore the plastic out of her ears, her face hot, and stared stubbornly at the magazine. </p><p>“Good read?” Rio said, nodding to the neon lettering: <em> Nature’s Wildest Mimicry</em>.</p><p>“Very,” Agatha muttered. </p><p>Rio was silent, and Agatha glanced out of the corner of her eye. She’d picked up Billy’s puzzle book. Agatha looked back at the magazine and landed on a picture of a caterpillar, one side of its body inflated. The black spots landed in just the right way, perfectly resembling the head of a snake.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat. </p><p>“She’s twenty-four. In case you were wondering.”</p><p>“I wasn’t.” </p><p>Agatha wasn’t. She’d already done the math in the car, while Rio was asleep. Katie Bishop had been in her class the year Jen was in fifth grade. Agatha spent each day bracing for Jen’s last, not yet knowing she’d come back. That year, she saw Jen in the faces of all her kids, including Katie. Or—<em> Kate</em>. She’d been shamelessly open and trusting, friendly, and feisty. She’d wanted to hold Agatha’s hand anytime they left the classroom. She was undeniably likeable, even then. Agatha ignored the odd, squirming feeling in her gut.</p><p>“I didn’t mean for her to stay over,” Rio said. “She just kind of passed out last night, and I didn’t—”</p><p>“I don't really care,” Agatha cut her off. Her eyes fell to her own fingers gripping the edges of the magazine—the permanent swell of her knuckles after childbirth, the skin looser around her tendons in a way that reminded her, suddenly, of her mother’s.</p><p>Agatha remembered Kate’s smile in the hallway that morning, the way she’d handed Rio the toothbrush and leaned into her. The easy space she took up in the hallway of the apartment. The smooth, young lines of her face. Agatha stopped looking at her hands, and read about caterpillars instead.</p><blockquote>
<p><b><em>Elephant</em></b> <b><em>Hawk Moth Caterpillars’ </em></b><em>defensive display startles </em><b><em>predators</em></b><em>—birds and other small mammals that might normally try to eat it. They drop to the soil to </em><b><em>pupate</em></b><em>, laying in a hard outer shell through the winter. In spring, the moth emerges and feeds on nectar through its </em><b><em>nocturnal </em></b><em>life.</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Agatha looked at the moth's bright pink-and-gold wings, and wondered why evolution would dictate a nocturnal life to something so gaudy. </p><p>She felt the seat dip next to her, then saw green in her periphery. Slowly, Rio rested two fingers on top of the magazine, lowering it from Agatha’s eyes.</p><p>She was wearing the same hoodie she’d thrown on in the car, the color of lichen on a tree trunk. Her eyes flashed golden brown under the hood, and Agatha turned to look out the window instead.</p><p>“She bartends at the club,” Rio said quietly. “Sometimes we fuck around, but we’re just friends.”</p><p>Agatha felt her lean closer, breath tickling the hair by her ear. “In case you were wondering any of that, too.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t move, the words sinking into her chest. She felt her rearing head return to something soft and slow. When she turned, Rio was buried deep in the puzzle book. Agatha watched her study the word search, holding it out in front of her. She turned it sideways, squinted, and then put it down again. Head bent, hair falling forward, she finally circled a word with Billy’s pen.</p><p>When Wanda and Billy returned, she made room for them, and returned to her seat. Wanda eyed Agatha, but didn’t comment, and Agatha was grateful. Unable to help herself, Agatha leaned over Billy to look. Overlapping his shaky identification of <em> LION </em>, Rio had circled the entire column. </p><blockquote>
<p>
<b>D  A  N  D  E  L  I  O  N</b>
</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>It rained from the moment they stepped off the plane through their damp, dramatic entrance into the hotel lobby. Finally, they’d ordered pizzas and resigned themselves to the unnaturally blue indoor pool. Vision and Wanda were already asleep on their loungers, even through the splashing and yelling, knocked out in the exact way Agatha expected of parents of nine year-old twins.</p><p>She looked around for Rio and almost missed her, crouched next to her suitcase. Her face scrunched as she rifled through her clothes. Agatha rolled her eyes. Of course she’d have been too distracted to pack properly, with Kate slobbering all over her. </p><p>She opened her mouth to say as much, but her words died in her throat as Rio stood. In one fluid motion, she stripped off her hoodie. Then, thumbs hooked into the waistband, she pushed her sweatpants down and swiftly stepped out of them. She stood there in sky blue boxers and that same tank top, and <em>yawned</em>. </p><p>Agatha tried and failed to look away. She didn’t know what she’d expected of Rio poolside. Maybe she’d thought she’d be wearing something skimpy or scandalous, closer to what she wore at the club—something with a slow, aching reveal that captivated the room. But now she was standing on the tile in bare feet and a sleep tank, stretching her arms above her head with a shuddering sigh, boxers slung low on her hips. And <em> fuck </em>did Agatha’s mouth water at the sight.</p><p>She shifted against the sling fabric of her chair, and the knots of her bikini dug into her neck. She’d packed her oldest, plainest swimsuit, opting to throw an oversized tee over the whole thing, and suddenly she wished she’d made time to buy a new one.</p><p>Rio was oblivious to the effects of her non-strip-tease, and jumped straight into the pool. Nicky giggled, goggles filling with water. His hair was tangled and scraggly, and Agatha couldn’t wait to wash it tonight, and smooth her fingers over his soft and sleepy head. As if he could hear her, Nicky swam to the side of the pool, his fingers gripping the lip of the tile.</p><p>“Mom,” he said, panting, and her heart clenched. Every so often, this past month, he’d started calling her ‘Mom’ instead of ‘Mama.’ She ached for the twin syllables.</p><p>“Hello, my birthday baby."</p><p>“I’m not a baby,” he said.</p><p>“I’m sorry. You’re almost eight! What was I thinking?”</p><p>“I don’t even know,” he replied, eyes wide. She snorted.</p><p>“Did we bring Mr. Robot Man? I want to show Billy and Tommy.”</p><p>“He’s not a pool toy. You can show them later, up in the room. Come here—let me fix your goggles.”</p><p>Once she’d adjusted them—and plucked a stray piece of plastic from his hair, and re-tied his ponytail—he swam hurriedly away. He stopped on the other side of the pool where Josh and his girlfriend sat side by side. Nicky planted his little hands on the side of the pool, looked up at the woman and yelled: “McKenna, look what I can do!”</p><p>Agatha watched his poorly executed handstand, and wanted to cry from the heartbreak. McKenna clapped, and stood, and Agatha hated her. Josh watched her warily as she made her way around the pool. Agatha locked eyes with him, and they just looked at each other for a moment. He looked away first. <em>Coward</em>.</p><p>“Wanda, wake the fuck up,” Agatha muttered, eyeing McKenna nearing closer. “<em>Wanda</em>.”</p><p>She slapped her leg, and Wanda jerked awake, blinking. McKenna finally reached them and smiled, perching on the end of Agatha’s lounger.</p><p>“Do you mind if I…?” McKenna gestured to the lounger she was already sitting on. Agatha stared.</p><p>“We didn’t really get a chance to talk earlier, so I just wanted to introduce myself,” McKenna said, still smiling. The curve of her lips was syrupy sweet.</p><p>“I wanted to thank you for inviting me on this trip."</p><p>Agatha resisted the urge to laugh, open-mouthed. <em> Inviting </em> her? She hadn’t fucking <em> invited </em>her. She didn’t even know her last name.</p><p>“Of course,” she said. The words scraped her throat.</p><p>“Josh says you’re a teacher."</p><p>Agatha nodded, not trusting herself to speak.</p><p>“I am, too,” she said. “It’s so exhausting sometimes, right? I teach Sunday meditation and Wednesday yoga.”</p><p>“Right,” Agatha said, matching her sweet smile. “We have <em> exactly </em>the same job.”</p><p>Wanda was turned to the side, but Agatha could see her trembling with the effort not to laugh. </p><p>“I don’t know how you do it, teaching and giving Nicky enough attention; it must be impossible. I can’t imagine giving it all up.” She gestured, and Agatha realized in a combination of disgust and humiliation that she was talking about her abs.</p><p>“And also,” McKenna added, lowering her voice, “I think we should talk about this whole <em> Rio </em>thing. I know Josh doesn’t want to make a big deal out of it, but I’m just not sure she should be…” She trailed off, glancing toward the pool.</p><p>Agatha felt her spine stiffen, the rage and terror trickling into her limbs. Her face was hot. She opened her mouth to say something undeniably scathing, and felt Wanda’s cool hand on her ankle. She shut her mouth. She avoided Wanda’s curious stare, and looked across the pool instead.</p><p>Her eyes found Rio instantly. She was submerged to her shoulders, teaching Tommy how to balance on a pool noodle, and her eyes widened as she fell off. She splashed sideways,  laughing and coughing, and it was mid-splutter that she caught Agatha’s eye. </p><p>She stood immediately, her face shifting. Agatha watched the way her tank top stuck to her wet torso, the outline of her tattoo just barely visible under the fabric. After a second, she leaned down to whisper something to Nicky, and glanced up conspiratorially. </p><p>“Mama, come play with us!” Nicky shouted, throwing his hands in the air, and Billy and Tommy joined in, chanting “A-ga-tha, A-ga-tha.” Agatha smiled, chest ballooning with affection, and stood.</p><p>“Duty calls,” she said to McKenna in as apologetic a tone as she could manage, walking straight to the deep end. </p><p>She lowered herself, legs dangling in. The tile under her thighs was a relief against her flushed skin. She considered taking her t-shirt off, and tried to remember a time when it wasn’t something she had to consider. It was cliche and pathetic, she knew—self-conscious in a room with her ex-husband. For fuck’s sake, Josh had seen her naked for over twenty years. But maybe that was it. Maybe she didn’t want her body on display, in front of the man who used to worship it before he’d stopped, and the body he worshiped now instead. The younger, skinnier one, with the six-pack abs, and time in the day for meditation. </p><p>Maybe she didn’t want to give Rio the opportunity to make any such choice. Rio, who by all accounts, hadn’t ever shown one ounce of self-consciousness. It was frankly baffling—not in black lace and stilettos, and not in her damn men’s underwear, soaking wet. </p><p>She was still standing, her torso exposed to the air, water dripping down her neck. And she was looking at Agatha. More specifically, she was looking at Agatha’s thighs, as high up as she could under the hem of the t-shirt, like she might be able to lift it with her eyes alone.</p><p>Suddenly, Agatha didn’t even remember who was in the room, let alone what Josh might think. All she could see was Rio’s stare, her chest rising and falling, and she leaned back on her hands for a second. She let the shirt crawl higher up her legs. Rio’s eyes traveled up the exposed length of them, lingering on the glimpse of purple at her hip. Agatha tried to care that Rio was eye-fucking her thighs in public, and that she should probably stop letting her, but she couldn’t for the life of her do anything but watch the slow trail of her gaze. </p><p>As the heat climbed up her stomach and into her throat, she dropped into the pool, t-shirt and all. The cool quiet pressed against her skull. She sank slowly, until her feet felt the old, familiar rub of pebble plaster. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>To this day, she couldn’t submerge herself without thinking of her first pool party, the summer before eighth grade. She’d worn her first two-piece swimsuit, checkered blue and white, and left her hair down. Of course, it had inflated to three times its size in the humidity, so she’d spent the entire afternoon in the pool, dunking her head every ten minutes to make sure it laid flat. She hadn’t even gotten out to eat her pizza, choosing instead to lean her elbows on the cement beside her paper plate.</p><p>She didn’t know these kids at the pool. She’d just moved, and her mother had a new business cleaning houses in the suburbs. At least, that’s what she’d said in the car, although Agatha had wondered how she was cleaning a whole house by herself with just a briefcase. She didn’t ask, though, because she didn’t want to help.</p><p>Instead, she hung around the front yard, throwing rocks at a tree trunk, until she saw a girl watching her over the fence. She had sandy blonde hair and dimples, and eyed Agatha curiously.</p><p>“Do you live there now?” she’d asked, and Agatha had shaken her head.</p><p>“How old are you?” the girl asked.</p><p>“Twelve.”</p><p>“Me too,” she’d said, and then she’d smiled. Agatha had smiled back, the sensation of easy friendship uncomfortable on her face.</p><p>“Wanna come to my pool party on Saturday?” The girl had said, and tilted her head. “There’ll be some boys there from school, and pizza and soda and stuff.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth watered. Boys were intriguing, given that she didn’t spend much time with them, but a backyard pool, in the suburbs, with pizza and soda? She hadn’t received a better invitation in all her twelve years.</p><p>“Okay,” she’d said, and the girl had smiled, then disappeared.</p><p>Agatha already knew where Evanora kept the extra cash in the apartment. She could tell which hiding spots she’d forgotten by the way she slowly stopped checking them. The next day, once Evanora had left, she unscrewed the faulty electrical outlet by the bathroom. She grinned in triumph, and pulled out a fifty-dollar note.</p><p>She walked straight to the mall and bought the swimsuit for twenty bucks. She’d spent the remaining thirty on her first tube of mascara, two hot dogs, and a small treasure trove of candy. She kept just enough change to buy herself a round trip train ticket for Saturday.</p><p>She’d felt fashionable and mysterious, showing up to the girl’s party, who Agatha learned was named Eloise. It sounded like the name of a princess. </p><p>“Wait, what’s your name, again?” Eloise had asked, chewing on one of the twenty individually wrapped twizzlers Agatha had brought for her, because she knew from TV that you were supposed to bring something to a party.</p><p>“Agnes,” Agatha replied. She didn’t point out that Eloise had never actually asked her name. Just her age, because that was more important, anyway. She didn’t know why she said <em> Agnes</em>, either, except that Eloise had such a pretty name, and Agatha felt that her name was boring. She’d learned at her last school that Agnes was Mother Teresa’s real name, and everyone loved Mother Teresa. Agatha wanted everyone to love her, too.</p><p>During her time in the pool, she’d learned three things. First, that most of these kids went to the same school she would start in the fall. Second, that some of the boys wouldn’t stop staring at her new checkered swimsuit, and she found she liked being looked at like that. And third, anyone did exactly what Eloise wanted them to do—get her chips from the table, tell her she looked pretty in her new bikini, ask Jimmy if he thought she was cute—except Agatha, because she’d stayed in the pool, for the sake of her hair.</p><p>For a minute, munching on her pizza with her elbows digging into concrete, she’d looked at the throng of kids crowding around Eloise and jumping onto pool noodles, and thought: maybe she would be a part of <em> this</em>, whatever this was.</p><p>At sunset, Agatha started to shiver, and reluctantly clambered out of the water. She tied her hair into a tight ponytail to prevent it from frizzing. When she looked up, the entire group of kids was staring at her with mixed expressions of horror. </p><p>She looked down. She’d assumed her stomach ache was due to nerves, or the amount of candy she’d eaten that week. But instead, it appeared that she was dying. She <em> felt </em>fine, but blood dripped down the sides of her legs, landing on the wet pavement. </p><p>She fought the urge to hyperventilate or cry. She could still feel her hands and the cement under her feet, and her heartbeat. That meant she was alive. <em> Breathe, Agatha.  </em></p><p><em> No. Agnes. </em> <em>Breathe, Agnes.</em></p><p>“Did you just get your period in my pool?”</p><p>Eloise’s horrified voice cut through the quiet. Agatha almost laughed in relief. <em> That’s </em>what it was. She’d heard other kids talk about it, and saw it vaguely referenced in her stolen magazines, but she’d always assumed she’d know when it was coming, like a big, red, warning light flashing on the horizon. </p><p>“Sorry,” she said, and looked at everyone else, who were still gawking. Some of them were trying not to laugh. Agatha didn't know then that none of them had any idea what to do, either. She figured she had committed the ultimate crime: swimming on her period, which—according to <em> Seventeen</em>—could attract sharks. She bled over the pavement, trying to put together why Eloise would be fearful of sharks in a backyard pool, when Eloise stood.</p><p>“Um,” she said, eyeing Agatha’s blood soaked blue checkers. “You should probably go home now.”</p><p>Agatha looked around again, at the discomfort on everyone’s faces, and understood. This, too—like so many things—must have been her fault. The shame was hot in her throat. She walked stiffly to the gate, her clothes in her hand, and then paused. She turned to the snack table, the tears finally welling in her eyes, and clutched the seven remaining twizzlers in her fist. She didn’t let a single tear fall.</p><p>She waited until she was in the safety of her bedroom, her body having betrayed her, and looked in the mirror. The cheap mascara had long since smeared across her face, and she realized it must have looked this way since the first second she’d gotten in the pool. The sob burst out of her. She rifled under her bed for the magazine, tore it in half, and flung the pieces down as the tears came faster.</p><p>Then, with no one to comfort her aching abdomen and wounded pride except herself, she stopped crying. She washed the blood off of her legs, and wrung out her swimsuit. She ate seven twizzlers, and taped the pieces of the magazine back together. She spent the rest of the night on the bathroom floor with her mother’s box of tampons in trial and error, following the “young women’s” tips on page twelve and her own sheer determination.</p><p>It was another four years before she was able to submerge herself in a swimming pool again, and although she’d always said it was because she didn’t like to be cold, the truth was that she didn’t know if she could bear it—the memory of them staring, the feeling of the bloody water dripping down her legs.</p><p>Now, Agatha’s lungs were starting to burn, at the bottom of this seven-foot hotel pool, and she remembered herself for a second. The checkered swimsuit. Scraped elbows from the cement. The constant dip of her hair to remove any semblance of a shape. Even now, she ached for Agnes.</p><p> </p><p>She wanted to stay underwater for another few minutes, limbs and hair suspended, until everyone left the room—Josh, McKenna, the kids, Wanda, Vision. Maybe even Rio. She wanted to stay until she was sure no one would be there when she came up for air, to stare, or laugh, or to decide something one way or another about what they saw.</p><p>She stayed as long as she could, until her chest and throat felt tight. She blinked her eyes open, and four wavy, misshapen forms drifted towards her. Three floating pairs of little legs, and one pair more solid, ending in sky blue. </p><p>Agatha’s eyes fluttered shut against the sting, and she knew suddenly that no matter how badly she wanted to stay still, her body would forever demand—to bend and bow, and bleed, and breathe. </p><p>She needed to breathe. She reached for the hem of her t-shirt, and pulled it over her head. This particular defensive display had done its job long enough, fooling onlookers who might otherwise tear straight at the flesh. It was <em> Nature’s Wildest Mimicry</em>, found in the grasslands of central Europe and the backyard pools of Massachusetts, where little girls learned to hide their soft, bleeding bellies from the eyes of the hungry.</p><p>She felt the shirt catch around the strings knotted at her back, then float away. Her hands adjusted the purple two-piece in that old, familiar way, and gently smoothed her fingers over the plane of her stomach. And when the light started to turn pink against her eyelids, a hint of something gaudy in the dark, she curled her toes against the tile, and pushed. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>By the time her second lychee martini arrived, Agatha accepted that Wanda wasn’t coming. She was probably passed out cold upstairs, somewhere between shower time and bedtime; Agatha was all too familiar, having walked an exhausted Nicky to Josh’s room and hugging him too long at the door. He’d sleep in her bed tomorrow, but she’d always hold him too long.</p><p>Her phone rang, and for a second she thought it might be Wanda, Then she flipped it over, and frowned.</p><p><b><em>Jane Foster GYNO</em></b> 👹🧟‍♀️🖕🏻</p><p>Why was Dr. Foster calling her? And then she remembered: her appointment had been one week ago. Pepper was calling to check her goddamn homework. She almost picked up out of pity. Who followed up with patients on a Saturday night?</p><p>“You gonna get that?” </p><p>Agatha felt Rio slide into the bar seat next to her before she registered the sound of her voice. She swallowed her last sip. </p><p>“Doctor,” Agatha said, taking in Rio’s wet hair. “Actually—substitute gynecologist.”</p><p>“I didn’t know they had those,” Rio said, gesturing to the bartender. “Everything okay?”</p><p>“She’s just calling to check my vagina homework,” Agatha said dryly, sucking the lychee from the toothpick. </p><p>Rio raised her eyebrows. “Is that a euphemism?” </p><p>Agatha pushed the empty glass away and accepted the full one. “I’m on the PMS ride from hell, and she thinks it’s because I’m seconds away from menopause.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio said, swirling her drink. “Perimenopause can be hard to diagnose, right?”</p><p>Agatha stared at her. “How the <em> fuck </em>do you know that?”</p><p>Rio laughed. “My closest friends for the last thirteen years have been women over the age of sixty who listen to Joni Mitchell and smoke a shit load of weed. They don’t exactly hold back about their aging bodies on my account.”</p><p>Agatha turned away, the surprise giving way to something meaner and smaller and more devastating. She stirred the toothpick.</p><p>“Yeah, well.” She inspected her nails. “How great for you.”</p><p>Rio was silent, and Agatha could feel her looking. </p><p>“Why do you still smell like the pool?” she added, grimacing.</p><p>“My shower didn’t have any shampoo in it and I was too tired to get some. And if you’re going to be an asshole, I’m going to sleep.”</p><p>Agatha looked up with a flicker of guilt, but Rio’s eyes were soft in understanding.</p><p>“Sorry,” Agatha said finally. “I’m just pissed about the weather. I didn’t plan on waiting in line for Space Mountain the fucking rain tomorrow.”</p><p>“Wait,” Rio said, setting down her drink. She narrowed her eyes, and Agatha narrowed her eyes back. “You just referred to Space Mountain by name, and you watch videos of roller coasters for fun."</p><p>“I should never have told you that.”</p><p>“Oh my god," Rio laughed. "You <em> love </em>Disneyland!”</p><p>Agatha scoffed, but she could feel her ears turning red. “No.”</p><p>“Oh, wow, you do. Who would have guessed that the indomitable Agatha Harkness is a Disney Adult?”</p><p>“Take it back,” Agatha said, mouth falling open. She swiped at Rio, who tried not to spit out her sip from laughter. Agatha dealt one more jab to Rio’s shoulder for good measure, and felt the third martini blur the edges of the exhaustion and frustration as they settled into comfortable silence. She glanced at Rio, watching the way her fingers drummed against the bartop.</p><p>“I didn’t know,” Agatha said finally. “About perimenopause. Or about… anything. My mother preferred to teach me as little as possible. I think in hopes that I would just disappear into the walls, or something.”</p><p>Rio was still looking at her, and Agatha forced herself to continue.</p><p>“One summer when I was eight, we drove across the country, and we stopped here. I don’t remember why—she had a boyfriend, I think, or maybe a drug deal. My mother loved fucking dudes and dealing drugs.”</p><p>“Don’t we all,” Rio muttered. Agatha choked on her drink.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Nope, that was a joke. Sorry. I’m not a drug dealer. Go on.”</p><p>“Convincing,” Agatha said, and smiled. “We came to Disneyland, and she actually stayed with me for most of it. It might have been the most time we ever spent together, besides the car ride. She bought me a cotton candy, and I could <em> not </em>figure out why she was handing it to me. It was the best six hours of my life, waiting in lines with her.”</p><p>Agatha remembered the sweet taste in her mouth, the sweat dripping down the back of her neck, her sunburned cheeks. It had been utter paradise, until—of course—Evanora disappeared. She left Agatha standing in the middle of the food court, and didn’t come back to get her until after the fireworks were over. She didn’t usually like to think about that part.</p><p>“I loved that day,” Agatha said. “But I didn’t want to ruin the memory. So I never came back.”</p><p>“Until now,” Rio said softly. </p><p>“Until now,” Agatha repeated, clearing her throat. “Nicky’s going to have the best eighth birthday anyone has ever had. Even if that means I have to control the fucking weather, somehow.”</p><p>Rio was smiling, soft and warm, and Agatha looked away. It was too much, when she looked at her like that. </p><p>Her eyes landed on the stragglers around the hotel lobby she could see out of the wide doorway. A woman reading a book, a drunk couple on the sofa. The man had his hands halfway up the woman’s skirt, and she was laughing. Agatha felt her face heat at even the sight of it, and she wanted to slap herself in the fucking face. <em>Second fucking puberty. At forty-fucking-two. </em></p><p>“<em>So</em>,” Agatha said, and even the one syllable felt abnormal. She felt the heat and the alcohol in her cheeks. “Kate. <em> Little </em>Katie Bishop.”</p><p>Rio groaned. “Why does this have to be such a <em> thing</em>?”</p><p>“You’re the one who’s fucking my former student.”</p><p>“I didn’t know!”</p><p>Agatha bit back a grin and sucked on the toothpick, cheeks hollowing. “She was clingy in second grade. Eager to please. Something tells me she hasn’t changed all that much, huh?”</p><p>Agatha could see Rio trying not to laugh, the corners of her mouth pulling upward.</p><p>“No, I guess she hasn’t,” she said, shaking her head. “She’s very…” Rio swirled the toothpick, searching for the right word. “Generous.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “And you’re into that?” she asked, fingers tapping her glass.</p><p>Rio looked at her. “Am I into beautiful women who go down on me for hours at a time? Yeah, I’m <em> into </em>that.”</p><p>“Hmm,” Agatha said, chewing her lip. Rio crossed her arms.</p><p>“What could possibly make you think I wouldn’t be into that?” she asked finally, and Agatha smirked. Now that she had found the button of Rio’s pride, it was impossible not to push it, to find the indignance that so easily flared.</p><p>“You’re about to get your master’s in teaching,” Agatha said. She leaned back, and crossed her legs on the barstool. “Tell me: what are the two most common types of students that consistently fail to complete classwork?”</p><p>“You can’t just lump students into two categories like that—”</p><p>“Oh, Jesus, I forgot you were the fucking patron saint of PC culture. You know what I’m trying to say, Rio.”</p><p>Rio laughed around her drink. “Okay, I’ll play. Learning differences, which are all extremely nuanced, by the way, so—”</p><p>“I’ve taught them all. Successfully, I might add. What’s the other reason?” </p><p>Rio played with the edge of the cocktail napkin. “Not enough engagement at home, history of trauma—it could literally be anything.” </p><p>“Those are good reasons,” Agatha said. “Sometimes it’s a combination of those. But the second most common reason kids give up is that some of them don’t find the work challenging enough, so they don’t even try. They’re under-stimulated.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes snapped to hers, her fingers stilling against the napkin. </p><p>“You think I’m <em> bored</em>,” she said, “with a woman’s tongue inside me?”</p><p>Agatha felt the glass slip in her grasp at the sheer force of the visual, and she clutched the stem to steady it. </p><p>She took a sip and swallowed, slow and deliberate, fingers stroking lightly against the base. She ran her tongue over her teeth, and tasted the film of sugar and lychee. She wondered, briefly, if the nectar from the flower tasted anything like the flesh of the fruit, soaked in vodka and vermouth. </p><p>She looked at Rio, just for a second. “I guess it depends on the woman.” </p><p>Her lips quirked up then, because she <em> knew </em>Rio—and as a result, knew that she was right on the fucking money, made even more certain by her silence. </p><p>Agatha shrugged, innocence undermined by the involuntary rasp in her throat:</p><p>“I guess I would’ve thought you liked to work for it a little.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth dropped open, the offense clear on her features, but Agatha could see the heat underneath—the hazel edging to deep, liquid brown. Stripped by chlorine and liquor, the want hit Agatha’s skin more harshly than she expected. In fact, it all but bowled her over, until she gripped the edge of the bar to steady herself. Rio looked down at her hand, obvious and undisguised, and licked her lips.</p><p>Agatha was suddenly aware of every inch of distance between them. She wanted to know, desperately, what Rio was thinking about. What she was picturing when she looked at Agatha’s hand, where she imagined it, what it was doing to her. She could have moaned at the thought of it, right there on the sticky barstool vinyl. She pressed her thighs together and opened her mouth—to say what, she wasn’t sure—and the bartender placed the check in front of her. </p><p>“My shift is over, if you wouldn’t mind closing out,” he said. Agatha wanted to stab him with the blue pen. </p><p>“You can put it on my room,” she said, still looking at Rio. “You want another?”</p><p>Rio checked the time, and shook her head. Agatha took in the sudden change in her demeanor. Her shoulders were stiff, eyes unfocused.</p><p>“I have that meeting tomorrow,” she said.</p><p>“Right,” Agatha drawled. She rolled head on her neck and stretched out her legs, shaking out the tension. “The oh-so-distinguished Conservatory of Urban Movement. Give me a fucking break.”</p><p>Agatha waited for Rio to smirk, or even for her mouth to curve upwards, but her face was flat, as if she hadn’t even heard. Her fingers traced a crack in the wood.</p><p>“Wanda never used to shut up about it,” Agatha continued. “I had to start calling it the CUM school just to get her to stop.”</p><p>Rio offered a small laugh, but her eyes stayed dull and distracted. Something turned in Agatha’s gut. </p><p>“They’re artsy, right?” she mused. “Wanda helped build their academic programs.” </p><p>Rio was silent, but Agatha couldn’t help it. She’d had too many martinis and had spent too long in the pool.</p><p>“Famous dance program,” she said, her tone sharpening. It wasn’t a question.</p><p>Rio looked up at her, startled. “Yeah. Starts at elementary.”</p><p>Agatha felt a strange, familiar pit opening at the base of her throat. Something she’d felt before, in Anaheim and in Boston, at eight years old, looking around a crowded food court, and then at twelve, bleeding on her bathroom floor. She stifled the feeling, silent with the effort of restraining what she knew brought an ugly streak.</p><p>“It’s just a meeting,” Rio said firmly, pushing her empty glass to the side. Her hands trembled lightly.</p><p>Agatha watched her, and bit at the side of her cheek. That same old something gnashed in her chest, chewed through the muzzle, and finally, sank its teeth. </p><p>"Sure. Of course. And did you bring a suit for this… <em> meeting</em>?” </p><p>Rio didn’t bite back. She stood slowly, gathering her things, and Agatha didn’t recognize the line of her mouth, the sudden wideness in her eyes, twitch of her face. It wasn’t anger, or annoyance, or disappointment, or anything she’d directed at Agatha before. Agatha tried valiantly to place it, the expression she’d never seen, and Rio didn’t meet her gaze. </p><p>“It’s just a meeting, Agatha,” she said again, quieter this time, and turned to leave.</p><p>“Wait.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look, and Rio didn’t turn. But she didn’t leave, either.</p><p>They were still for a moment—one person at a bar, and another in a doorway, neither of them willing to look the other in the eye and see inside for longer than six seconds.</p><p>But Agatha had already seen, she realized. She knew the stillness in Rio’s frame, even through the unfamiliar shape of it around her shoulders. It’d been <em> fear </em>on her face. Rio was scared.</p><p>Agatha turned to face her back, still standing square in the doorway of the hotel bar. <em> This </em>was something she knew, not because she’d been taught, but because she’d learned. And because there was something in her she’d discovered the day she stepped in front of a classroom, and then again when she’d first held Nicky in that hospital bed. There was something in her that had always known—despite Evanora’s attempts to destroy it—how to comfort a creature more fearful than she was herself.</p><p>“When they—” Agatha paused, took a breath, and started again. “When they ask about your experience, refer to yourself as a teacher. An educator. Own it.”</p><p>Agatha could see the rise and fall of Rio’s shoulders, and knew she was listening.</p><p>“And they’re going to probably ask you something anecdotal about a student’s growth,” Agatha continued. “I know you; I know you’re not going to want to be specific, because you think you’re exploiting them, or something. But they just want to see who you are. Talk about Luca. He’s doing so much better because of the way you check in with him. And Kara—she used to be so scared to raise her hand, and now whenever <em> you </em>get up there, she can barely fucking control herself. You know, just, things like that.”</p><p>Rio wasn’t moving, and Agatha felt something like affection overcome her at the way she was just standing there. The way she needed to hear Agatha say this. And <em> no</em>, Agatha did <em> not </em>feel this way about this obstinate maniac, this absolute crazyperson, standing with her back to her in a hotel bar.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said softly. Rio’s shoulders tensed. </p><p>“What if they—” she said finally. Her voice was thick. “What if they know about me? My injury. What if they want to <em> talk </em>about it, and what if they think I can’t…” She paused, and Agatha’s chest tightened.</p><p>“How could I teach at a <em>conservatory </em> when I ruined my own career? How could they believe I’m not going to fuck up someone else’s? How can <em> I </em> be sure that I’m not going to—”</p><p>“Rio.” Agatha stood now. She thought of a supply closet in September, and Rio’s hands at her waist, tucking in a juice-soaked dress.</p><p>She moved across the room. </p><p>“Turn around,” she said softly. </p><p>Rio jumped at the proximity, but stayed otherwise still.</p><p>Agatha reached up, her hand hovering, then let it settle where the bend of Rio’s shoulder met her neck. Her thumb brushed against wet hair. </p><p>Her touch seemed to melt Rio. She turned immediately. Agatha barely registered the tears in her eyes before Rio stepped suddenly into her—arms around her waist, face pressed to her shoulder. Agatha blinked. Rio was <em> hugging </em>her.</p><p>The innocence of it made Agatha squeeze her eyes shut. She pressed a hand to the back of Rio’s hair automatically, stroking until her breathing evened, and her arms loosened.</p><p>Rio stepped back after a minute, swiping at her face. She puffed her cheeks, exhaling hard. She didn’t apologize, and Agatha found that, of all things, intoxicating.</p><p>“First impressions are kind of your thing,” Agatha said finally. “I wouldn’t be too worried about the principal of CUM.”</p><p>Rio’s watery laugh burst out of her, and Agatha smiled. </p><p>“Okay,” Rio said, nodding. “I’m okay. Thank you. For the advice.”</p><p>Agatha stepped back awkwardly.</p><p>“Are you staying, or… ” Rio gestured to the doorway. Rationally, Agatha knew what she was asking—if Agatha was going to her <em> own </em>room, to go to sleep, and stay there. But she didn’t feel like she could do it—stand in an elevator next to Rio, who’d just been wrapped in her arms, smelling of swimming pools and stone fruit. </p><p>“Staying,” Agatha said.</p><p>Rio shot her a sad sort of smile, the smallest flash in her eyes of something open and wanting, like she knew exactly what Agatha was thinking. And then she was gone.</p><p>Agatha sat back at the bar, staring at her glass that she’d known was already empty. The speared lychee and maraschino stared back. She pulled them both off at once with her teeth, and the sweetness burned in her throat. Two drupe fruits, peeled and pitted, left to brine until they were plucked from the jar and speared through the flesh. Two complementary tastes, equal and not so opposite.</p><p> </p><hr/><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Agatha laid spread-eagle in her hotel room. She was dehydrated from flying, leaden limbed from swimming, and three-martinis-in-an-hour to the wind. She’d given up undressing half way, her arms splayed sideways across the bedspread as she watched the slow twist of the ceiling fan.</p><p>The waistband of her jeans dug into her belly, and she yawned as she undid the button and zipper. Taking them all the way off was still too much effort. She felt like some kind of sloppy, drunk cowboy—bare-chested and light-wash jeans undone. She laughed at the visual, and sang with a twang: “And when I’m dead and buried, Susanna, don’t you cry.” </p><p>She drummed her fingers on her stomach, and shut her eyes. “Just for one second,” she mumbled to herself. And then she would take off her pants, and brush her sticky teeth that had started to buzz in time with the numbness in her face.</p><p>Something poked into her back, disturbing the one second that had turned into sixty, and she bent her arm awkwardly to yank it free. The perimenopause pamphlet. Maybe it wasn’t too late to rip it into shreds and toss it over the hotel bed like rose petals, or a morbid kind of confetti. The room spun a little, and she rolled to her stomach. She looked at the pink paper again. Then, topless and drunk in her hotel room, she read it cover to cover. </p><p>Satisfied she had memorized all the material after seven thorough minutes, she smacked her mouth together and pulled out her phone in a gunslinger’s quick-draw. <em> Fastest hands in Anaheim, </em> she thought, and was still mid-laugh when Pepper picked up.</p><p>“This is very embarrassing for you, Dr. Pepper,” Agatha slurred slightly. “Picking up a patient phone call on a Saturday night.”</p><p>“You’re returning my call on a Saturday night,” Pepper pointed out. “How are you doing, Agatha?”</p><p>“Good,” Agatha said. “Goooood.”</p><p>“I called to check in about the pamphlet, like we discussed. Is now an okay time?”</p><p>“It’s an incredibly perfect time, actually,” Agatha said. “I just read it.”</p><p>“Just now?”</p><p>“Yup.”</p><p>“Agatha?” Pepper paused. “Are you drunk?”</p><p>Agatha laughed, dropping her head face down on the starchy bedspread. “Why, yes, Doctor; I believe I am.”</p><p>“How many drinks?”</p><p>“Three lychee martinis. Have you ever <em> had </em>a lychee martini?”</p><p>“Yes,” Pepper said, amusement creeping into her voice. “They’re delicious. Agatha, I’m going to ask you to read the pamphlet again another time—when you’re sober—and call me back then, okay?”</p><p>“No, wait,” Agatha blurted. “I really did have an… important question.”</p><p>“Okay. If it's important.”</p><p>Agatha smashed her face into the bedspread again.</p><p>“<em>Ennggkks</em>,” she said, the sound muffled the sheets.</p><p>“Sorry?”</p><p>Agatha lifted her head. “Sex. What about sex?”</p><p>“What about it?”</p><p>“Can I still, like…” she huffed. “It wasn’t in the pamphlet.”</p><p>“I’m more than happy to answer your questions.” Pepper’s voice was gentle. “I’m just going to need you to be a little more specific. Have you been facing any challenges with sex recently?”</p><p>“Well, I haven’t been having any, as you know. No need to rub it in. No pun intended, ha.” She chuckled to herself. Pepper didn’t take the bait. </p><p>“You mentioned changes in libido. Do you think a decrease in sexual desire is preventing you from—”</p><p>“I don’t have a <em> decrease </em>in sexual desire,” Agatha interrupted, kicking her feet in the air. “I have the opposite problem. I feel like a horny fucking teenage boy.”</p><p>“Oh, I see,” Pepper said, as if slotting this information into the accurate, whole image of Agatha. “And are you concerned about that?”</p><p>“I mean, it’s a little distracting.”</p><p>“You know, masturbation can be a great—”</p><p>“Woah, okay,” Agatha held up a hand. “That’s not what I called to ask about.” She rolled her eyes. Doctors were so stupid sometimes. She would speak slowly, she decided, so that Dr. Pepper could understand.</p><p>“I’m asking,” Agatha enunciated. “If I have sex, is there anything, like, permeni—” she fumbled the word, her lips feeling slow, and tried again. “<em>Perimenopause-y </em>—that’s going to affect it? In the future? Like, I don’t know, hormones? Can I still orgasm? Will everything still be… normal?”</p><p>“Those are great questions. Thank you for asking.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but her cheeks flushed.</p><p>“Well first and foremost,” Pepper began, “there is still the possibility of getting pregnant if you’re having vaginal sex with a partner who has—”</p><p>“I'm not asking about dick sex,” Agatha interrupted. “Skip. Next.”</p><p>“Okay,” Pepper laughed. “So no pregnancy concerns. With libido ruled out, the only other thing you might want to watch for besides the usual STIs is vaginal dryness. But that’s manageable. I recommend using lubricant generously. Or we can talk about estrogen treatment sometime, if you’re interested.”</p><p>“Vaginal dryness?” Agatha groaned into the bedspread. “That is so <em> not </em>hot.”</p><p>“Totally normal. Remember: ‘Nothing sets the mood / like consent and lots of lube!’”</p><p>“That was foul,” Agatha muttered into the comforter, but she snorted anyway.</p><p>“One more thing. You mentioned you’ve only had male partners.”</p><p>Agatha’s lungs knotted again, and she rolled over to her back. The fan spun in slow circles, and she felt the air on her bare chest. “Yeah, so?” </p><p>“Is that something you want to know more about? Any questions about, say, non-dick-sex?”</p><p>Agatha’s laugh burst out of her. “Finally pulled that stiletto out of your ass, I see.” </p><p>She let the silence stretch. Her eyes caught the reflection in the mirror of the painting above the bed, a scene of a river and a mountain. Stock and nondescript. She thought it was beautiful.</p><p>“If it even ever happens,” she said finally. “And I’m not saying it will. I mean, because we can’t, at least not right now, and even once we could, I don’t know if I, if...” She trailed off.</p><p>Pepper waited patiently.</p><p>“What if I’m bad at it?” The words burst out of her, and she covered her face with her free hand. “What if I’m as bad as those fucking college guys who finger you like they have sausages for hands; I mean, Jesus, it was mostly bad.”</p><p>Agatha heard a soft sort of huffing noise, and realized Pepper was laughing. </p><p>“I don’t think you’re allowed to laugh at me.”</p><p>“I’m not—I just know what you mean,” she clarified. “But, Agatha–”</p><p>Agatha squeezed her eyes shut as the delayed reality of the moment hit her square in the face. She was drunk in a hotel room, talking to her doctor about the birds and the bees, or the <em> Devil’s Seesaw</em>, or whatever the fuck they were calling it these days.</p><p>“Do you think this person cares enough to communicate?" Pepper asked. "To advocate for themselves and to make sure you’re okay?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fluttered shut. She saw Rio’s eyes, pulling her wordlessly into the pool. Felt her hands around her waist, clutching tightly. Face buried in her shoulder, hair wet under the slow stroke of her hand. </p><p>“Yes,” she said quietly.</p><p>“And if you’re feeling self-conscious about it, could you tell them?”</p><p>Agatha paused. She’d never considered that. She didn’t <em> want </em>to consider that.</p><p>“No. I don't know.”</p><p>“That’s okay. I’m not saying you have to. But it might be worth thinking about before you decide anything.”</p><p>“I’m not deciding anything,” Agatha grumbled. The fan spun. Once. Twice.</p><p>“Do you have a therapist, or friends you could talk to about all this?”</p><p>“I’m talking to you.”</p><p>“Of course,” Pepper said gently. “But I meant someone else, too.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed. “It’s complicated.”</p><p>“I’m sorry to hear that.”</p><p>Pepper was silent then, and Agatha was grateful she didn’t try to offer something else.</p><p>“Thanks,” she said. The single word felt like molasses in her mouth.</p><p>“Anytime, Agatha. Drink some water, please. And read the pamphlet again when you’re sober.”</p><p>“Aye aye, captain.”</p><p>Agatha saluted the ceiling fan, and flung her phone across the room. She needed to brush her teeth, she thought vaguely. And take off her jeans. She thought about Wanda, her inquisitive, worried, wide eyes, and it was the last thing she saw before she drifted into a fitful sleep.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Agatha gave Nicky his birthday present in the morning—a toy robot-dog to go with his robot-man—and he’d spent forty minutes walking it to everyone’s room to introduce it, one by one. Rio and Wanda had been absent, and Agatha had tried not to think about it. She was trying not to think about a lot of things. </p><p>She’d<em> drunk dialed her gynecologist</em>. That was a new one, even for her. She made a mental note to send Pepper some flowers, or whatever more appropriately conveyed: ‘Sorry I called you while drunk and topless and made you say ‘dick sex.’”</p><p>With Nicky dressed and settled on the carpet with the twins, she escaped to the lobby for the good coffee, and ran face-first into Rio.</p><p>“Sorry,” Agatha said, taking in her appearance. “Nice blazer.”</p><p>They were still blocking the elevator doors, and someone stepped around them. Rio adjusted the hem of her sleeve, and scratched her eyebrow, then finally, looked at Agatha.</p><p>“Do you want to grab some coffee?” </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>They perched on the stiff lobby sofas, paper cups in hand. Agatha sat casually, as if she wasn’t dying to hear every last detail, or figure out why Rio couldn’t look her in the eye. She didn’t want to spook her—Rio reminded her of a jumpy horse, ready to rear and run at the lightest needling of a question.</p><p>“Where’s Wanda?” Agatha said, glancing around. She spied a man with a sunburn and a fanny pack, and two bellhops rolling a cart idly back and forth. Everyone in the hotel was probably still asleep, or eating breakfast in bed, or having incredible hotel morning sex. Fuck them and their easy vacations.</p><p>“Parking,” Rio said. She took a sip of her coffee. Agatha wanted to shake her.</p><p>She narrowed her eyes. She <em> knew </em>how to shake her.</p><p>“So… has <em> Kate </em>ever seen you in a big girl suit?” </p><p>Rio’s eyebrows shot up, and her knee stopped bouncing.</p><p>“No,” Rio said. Her face was a little too knowing for Agatha’s taste.</p><p>“You should show her,” Agatha said evenly. “It’s a nice change of pace from your usual getup. I’m sure she’d appreciate learning about the rare, classy medium between lingerie and sweats.”</p><p>“I don’t think she’d appreciate the belt.”</p><p>“Why?” Agatha grimaced around her coffee. “Too complicated for your golden retriever’s clumsy little paws?”</p><p>Rio moved slowly, deliberately. She leaned towards her, arm braced on the coffee table, and the playfulness in her eyes was gone. Agatha swallowed.</p><p>“You should really be more careful, Agatha,” Rio said. Her voice was low, almost mean, and Agatha tried not to shiver at the sudden shift.</p><p>“And why is that?” Agatha’s voice came out in an almost-whisper. She clutched the styrofoam.</p><p>“If you don’t stop asking about Kate, I’m going to think you’re jealous.”</p><p>Agatha tried to scoff. “And, you think jealousy is, what—unbecoming?”</p><p>Rio’s tongue crept between her teeth, over her canine, and retreated. Her face was too close, breath on Agatha’s lips. </p><p>“No,” she said. </p><p>Agatha took in the slow twitch of her lip, the tic of her jaw clenching and unclenching.</p><p>“So what’s the problem?” Agatha whispered, aiming for theatrical but falling miserably short. </p><p>Rio’s eyes grew dark, and she slid her hand up Agatha’s knee, fingers brushing her thigh.</p><p>“If you keep pushing me,” Rio said, face twitching. “I’ll push back.” Her fingers tightened, nails digging into Agatha’s thigh, and Agatha bit back a noise. Her own fingers tightened around the cup instead, and she heard the soft crack of the side, a slow drip starting down the side of her hand.</p><p>“And when I do,” Rio continued, “you won’t want to be in the lobby of a hotel.”</p><p>Agatha felt the coffee dripping onto her pajamas, over Rio’s hand. Rio wiped the back of her hand clean on the fabric at Agatha's thigh, slowly, and withdrew it. The action of it was obscene, her words echoing in Agatha’s ears, and she was caught between finding the nearest empty room with a lock on the door, and figuring out why Rio was suddenly in <em> destroy </em>mode. It wasn’t that she minded, necessarily, but there was something off about her. It was disconcerting. Incredibly hot, yes—but disconcerting.</p><p>Rio was sitting there on her side of the couch like nothing had happened, sipping her own coffee, and Agatha threw her mess in the trash. She saw Wanda walk in out of the corner of her eye, and stroll to the elevators. </p><p>“I was talking more about your fashion choices,” Agatha said, shaking back her hair. “Did you really wear a <em> t</em>-<em>shirt </em> to that meeting?” </p><p>“It’s under a blazer,” Rio said, still stony-faced. “And I like this shirt.”</p><p>Agatha huffed. “It—” she stopped, eyes lingering over the collar. She spotted the small fleck of blue against white.</p><p>“There’s a stain,” she mumbled, still staring. </p><p>She knew that shirt. She’d worn it. She’d accidentally, or not accidentally, kept it for almost an entire month before sneaking it into Rio’s gym back one day. <em> She’d </em>gotten blue marker on the collar.</p><p>Agatha stood abruptly, and Rio glanced at the sudden motion. Agatha shook the excess coffee off her leg. This was all too much for this time in the morning. Why was it always too much whenever Rio was involved?</p><p>“I have to shower,” Agatha said shortly, and didn’t care that it sounded like utter bullshit. She didn't look back at Rio, leaving her to her lobby coffee and tainted t-shirt and strangely short fuse. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>By some miracle, the clouds had parted, and they’d stepped through the gates of Disneyland under a perfect blue sky. Agatha felt weightless in the sunshine, the tops of her shoulders and ears tinged red. She laughed at the simple joy of a sunburn. She braved every ride, even the rollercoasters she could no longer stomach. After the fourth one, Wanda sat her down on a patch of grass, head between her knees. Agatha breathed, embarrassed by her weak vestibular system—the old, tired workings of her inner ear. She never would have guessed she’d one day be angry at her inner ear.  </p><p>She stayed there a moment longer, steadying her near-heaving, watching Josh and McKenna idle hand in hand. McKenna had stuck to Josh’s side all day, sweating through her flat-ironed hair, and Agatha had almost felt bad. Then she'd tied her own hair up, and added a second hair tie to absolve herself from future favors, because she didn’t feel <em> that </em>bad. </p><p>Agatha suspected McKenna’s mood had less to do with the heat, and more to do with Rio, who’d apparently woken up with a mission to wreak quiet havoc. She’d offered McKenna the wrong directions, stopped directly in front of her to tie her shoe three separate times, and cut her in line to order the last Dole Whip from the cart.</p><p>“You hate pineapple,” Agatha muttered, finally baffled enough to say something. </p><p>Rio just shrugged. “Maybe my taste buds have matured.”</p><p>On the heels of the “one more ride” declarations, Agatha caught a glimpse of Rio strolling towards them in line, her face sharp and sullen, but then the look disappeared, and Agatha wondered if she’d imagined it. Rio raised her eyebrows at Nicky.</p><p>“I got a very special message,” she said seriously. “From the high-ups at Disneyland. They said that when it’s someone’s birthday, they get another birthday treat before the last ride.”</p><p>Nicky grinned. “Like what?”</p><p>Rio pulled an enormous spear of cotton candy from behind her back, and laughed as Nicky grabbed it and immediately tried to bite it.</p><p>Agatha’s chest felt warm. “What do you say?”</p><p>“Thank you,” Nicky said perfunctorily, his mouth stuffed with sugar. “Billy, look how huge this is!” He ran ahead to show the rest, and when Agatha turned back, Rio was holding out a second spear of cotton candy.</p><p>“What’s that for?” Agatha said, crossing her arms.</p><p>“You know, the higher-ups at Disneyland are very thorough with their research,” Rio said. Agatha’s heart pounded.</p><p>“What are you talking about?” she said, voice tight.</p><p>Rio reached into her pocket. “I grabbed your ID last night by mistake.” She looked at Agatha. “It’s your birthday, too.”</p><p>Agatha shut her eyes for a second, frustration swelling in her hot face. It felt invasive, like Rio had reached beneath her sternum, laced her fingers through the bone, and tugged, hard. She opened her eyes.</p><p>“Remember that sweet old story about Evanora Harkness I told you last night? That was an exception. There are no more sweet stories, okay?”</p><p>Rio’s face softened, and Agatha continued.</p><p>“One time, before I could read, I asked my mother when my birthday was, and she said ‘last week.’ I never got to celebrate my birthday. And I don’t allow anything getting in the way of Nicky celebrating his. So no singing, no cake, no <em> cotton candy</em>, unless it’s for him. Is that clear?”</p><p>Rio blinked. She shook her head, her eyes soft and something else that made Agatha want to cry. Or hug her again. She didn’t know which, and she didn’t know why.</p><p>“It’s not for your birthday.” She shrugged. “Sometimes cotton candy is just cotton candy.”</p><p>She held it out again.</p><p>Agatha ignored the sharp, billowing feeling in her chest. Her arm lifted of its own accord, and took it. It was just cotton candy. That Rio had bought for her, and brought to her, and pressed into her palm.</p><p>Rio tucked her tongue to her cheek. “What do you say?” she said, voice lilting in the way Agatha had expected from the beginning. She felt relieved to hear it, her mouth twitching against her will. She looked at the cotton candy. Specifically, at a chunk missing from the top. </p><p>“Did you take a bite out of this?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Convincing,” Agatha said, and took a bite next to the missing piece. They inched up the line in silence, and Agatha watched her glare daggers at McKenna’s back.</p><p>“Are you going to tell me what’s going on with you and McKenna?” Agatha said finally. “What’s <em> your </em>problem with this whole situation?”</p><p>Rio’s expression faltered a little, just for a second. “No idea what you’re talking about.”</p><p>“Jesus, fine,” Agatha groaned. “Then at least tell me how the <em> meeting </em>went this morning. You’re acting really fucking weird, Rio, and it’s freaking me out.”</p><p>Rio didn’t have an answer for that, her face blanking for a second. Agatha bristled. </p><p>“We’re here,” Rio said, pointing to the ride gates. “You should finish that.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes and shoved the rest of the cotton candy into her mouth, wincing at the sugar burn. She sat begrudgingly next to Josh, behind the three boys, and looked at McKenna, standing on the platform. More accurately, at Rio—standing next to her.</p><p>“I’ll meet you guys at the bottom,” McKenna said, waving. </p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said. “Me too.”</p><p>“<em>What</em>?” Agatha couldn’t help the incredulous tone. It was odd, Rio choosing to stay. Everything about Rio’s behavior was odd. She’d chalked it up to the fact that, well, <em>Rio</em> was odd. But now, with that sharp, focused look in Rio’s eye, Agatha wasn’t so sure. She considered jumping out, but settled for locking eyes with Rio as long as she could, trying to decipher her expression.</p><p>“What was that about?” she asked Josh once they fell out of view. His eyes roved everywhere but her face. </p><p>“Hey,” she said, sharper. “What happened?”</p><p>“I don’t really—” He ducked as the first curtain water fell. The boys yelled in delight as they continued floating lazily. Agatha flicked the water off her face, and looked at him expectantly.</p><p>“McKenna was saying some stuff to me yesterday, at the pool.” Josh waved his hand vaguely, and then rubbed at his ear. “I told her to stop, but I think Rio heard.”</p><p>Agatha felt the pit in her stomach. “What kind of <em> stuff</em>?”</p><p>Josh lowered his voice and flicked his eyes, just once, to Wanda sitting behind them. “Stuff we can talk about later, maybe?” </p><p>Agatha turned forward, heart pounding. She remembered the proposition McKenna had whispered by the pool, the syrupy tone and quiet contempt. It clicked, suddenly. Rio’s erratic behavior—one second ecstatic, then emotional, then going after McKenna like a wolf on a hunt. She was<em> hurting. </em></p><p>Agatha was going to kill McKenna. She didn’t care what she'd said, and she didn't know how she was going to pull off a murder at Disneyland in the middle of the day, but she was going to find a way. </p><p>“I know what you’re thinking,” Josh said, his voice still hushed. “She’s just feeling a little overwhelmed with all of the <em> information</em>. It’s a lot, you have to admit.”</p><p>“Would it have killed you to keep that <em> information </em>to yourself?” Agatha forgot to be quiet. Nicky turned his head to look at her, and she shut her mouth. </p><p>“Sorry,” she said. “Look, baby, here comes the next one!” </p><p>Nicky followed her finger to the next waterfall, and put his hands up in glee as it showered them. She slicked back her hair, water rolling down the sides of her neck. She could feel Wanda’s eyes on her in the back seat. She couldn’t think. </p><p>“Agatha–” he started.</p><p>“No.” Her voice was a furious whisper. “As far as I’m concerned, whatever she said, you let her say it. That’s just as fucking bad.”</p><p>He was silent, then, and they reached the top of the hill before the drop. Agatha could see the food court below them. The crowd had started to thin in the afternoon slump, the air cooling into almost-evening, and standing in the corner by the corn dog cart, Agatha saw Rio. Even from this high up, Agatha could see it—the tightness in her shoulders, the fury etched deep into her face. It startled her. She couldn’t remember ever seeing Rio look like that.</p><p>Agatha’s heart was in her throat. She wanted to unbuckle the seatbelt, jump out of the ride, and run all the way down to step between them. Her fingers clenched into the lap bar.</p><p>“Agatha.” It was Wanda this time, quiet and questioning. Before Agatha could turn to look at her, they dropped.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>She dismounted at the bottom with suddenly shaky legs, unsure why exactly her brain seemed to be short-circuiting. She stood there, dripping onto the floor, trying to breathe.</p><p>“Hey, are you–” Wanda placed a hand on her back, and she blinked. </p><p>“Can we go again?” Nicky asked, and Billy and Tommy tugged at Wanda. </p><p>“Please? Just one more.”</p><p>“Go with Dad,” she said, nodding at Vision, and turned back to Agatha. </p><p>Agatha put her hand on the railing to steady herself. </p><p>“What’s wrong?” Wanda asked, and Agatha shook her head, moving past her. Wanda put out her arm.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“We have to go.” Agatha took her arm, aiming for gentle, but her fingers dug into the flesh. Wanda didn’t flinch. “Wanda—”</p><p>“I’ve spent the last eight months letting you go,” she said, eyes wide. There was a familiar hint of defiance underneath. </p><p>“You can’t blow me off forever. I can <em>see </em>you, Agatha. I <em>see </em>something’s been happening. And now you have that terrifying, <em>stupid </em>look, like you’re going to burn something down.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her, eyes pricking with tears. She’d forgotten that Wanda may have been the person who knew her best in the world, and still loved her for it. For all of her tendencies and omissions and floating, untethered parts. When had she <em>forgotten</em>?</p><p> “I—”  The words caught in her throat. “Rio—” </p><p>She stopped again, and felt Wanda’s stare. She was standing at the side of the pool all over again, her insides one wrong step from spilling out onto wet cement. Rio wasn’t thinking straight, and now, neither was she. That was two bad, dangerous, catastrophic things already, and they hadn't even made it to the food court.</p><p>Any minute, the things she had, the things she loved, the things she wanted—even the ones she’d never said out loud—would be gone. Wanda. Rio. <em> Nicky</em>. </p><p>She stepped back suddenly, and her back hit a plastic sign. The words tumbled out of her, rough and biting.</p><p>“The meeting this morning,” she said. “Job interview?”</p><p>Wanda was silent, and Agatha felt the fear gnashing in her chest again. She took another step back.</p><p>“Just Rio?” she said, quiet now. “Or you, too?”</p><p>Wanda’s face shifted to fleeting guilt.</p><p>“Just Rio,” she replied, and took a slow step forward. “I was just doing my job—she asked me not to tell you.”</p><p>
<em> She asked me not to tell you. </em>
</p><p>Agatha felt the words hit her physically.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Wanda said gently, stepping forward again. Agatha felt trapped against the metal fence at her back. </p><p>“I didn’t know you cared this much about—” Wanda paused. “I’m <em> sorry</em>, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha dislodged herself from the corner. She walked down the ramp, her legs carrying her mindlessly, and her breathing was uneven and rackety in her chest. The air had cooled, hitting her wet clothes, but she couldn’t feel any of it. </p><p>Finally, she spotted Rio. Josh was there, too, now. Rio’s hair was standing up as if she’d run her fingers through it in frustration, and her cheeks were flushed. And she was <em> yelling</em>.</p><p>Agatha felt Wanda’s arm on her wrist again, and this time she didn’t bother yanking it free. She bumped into bodies, people muttering at her, and she barely heard Wanda’s scattered apologies behind them.</p><p>McKenna’s shrill, wild voice cut plainly through the noise:</p><p>“...that their teacher is a <em> whore</em>?”</p><p>“Whoa,” Josh cut her off. “Let’s just—”</p><p>Agatha stopped dead in her tracks. Rio took a step towards McKenna.</p><p>“Shut the fuck up,” she said. A vein pulsed in her neck.</p><p>“Why? So you can explain to me how you’re such a good role model?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said. “I spend more time with your boyfriend’s kid than you fucking do, by the way. Do you even know his favorite color? It’s orange, but the kind on a creamsicle, not the actual fruit.”</p><p>The mention of Nicky pierced through Agatha’s haze of panic, pulling her forward. She reached them just as McKenna said: “That's besides the point! No one in their right mind is <em> ever </em> going to let a <em> stripper </em>teach their children. I don’t know how Josh let this—”</p><p>Agatha felt Wanda’s hand drop from her wrist.</p><p>She saw Rio move in slow motion, reaching for the nearest thing and hurling it. It was a half-eaten tray of garlic fries, the fries hitting McKenna in the face, bits of garlic and oil dripping down her perfectly straightened hair.</p><p>Agatha moved on instinct. She stepped between them as McKenna moved. And for the second time in her life, a full cup of lemonade hit her straight in the chest. She gasped, ice cubes stinging her skin as they slid down her shirt.</p><p>The group was suddenly silent. McKenna lowered her arm.</p><p>And Agatha turned, slowly.</p><p>Rio’s wide eyes met hers, and then slid past her to Wanda. Agatha shut her eyes for a second, trying to keep her balance, and when she opened them, Rio’s expression had shuttered closed. She pushed past Agatha. </p><p>“You both should have just stayed home that day,” she muttered, “found some other way to pass the time and left me the <em> fuck </em>out of it.”</p><p>And then she was gone, weaving quickly through the crowd. The sound faded in Agatha’s ears as she watched Rio walk away. Her heart thundered in her chest. Her vision narrowed. </p><p>Her eyes searched the crowd, her thoughts jumbled. Pink bench, mickey ears, the sign on the corn dog cart. <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> was playing over the speakers. And suddenly, shivering and clutching the image of Rio’s disappearing form, a memory cracked open under her feet.</p><p>She was there again, that same day—eight years old, holding an empty paper stick of cotton candy. She’d finished it, but she didn’t want to throw away the evidence of something so perfect. She’d been standing in a food court when she realized her mother was gone. Maybe Evanora had said something—<em>see you in a few hours</em>—and Agatha had missed it. More likely, she’d said <em> stay here</em>, and nothing else. Either way, she was suddenly alone.</p><p>Agatha had always believed she’d waited in the food court and watched the fireworks, legs kicking against the bench until her mother came back to get her. She assumed she’d always known, from the moment her lungs expanded and her first cry hit the open air, that Evanora would always leave. That there was no use in trying to stop her, and that anyway, her time was better spent by herself.</p><p>But now, Agatha was staring down the pathway next to this food court that might even have been the same one, and she remembered running down it. She hadn’t waited. She’d been overcome with panic, the tears in her throat, and blindly, without reason, she’d run after her mother. She’d stepped over leftover cups and wrappers, lost toys and sidewalk gum, until there were tears blurring her vision and all of the people in front of her looked the same. Only then had she taken three deep breaths, and found her way back to the bench.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had known for as long as she could remember that her body would betray her. That it would grow old and tired without her permission, that it would make her feel things before she was ready. But she’d never considered that maybe what her body had wanted of her had come first: the outburst of anger and despair at a school board meeting, the pull towards a woman in a pink-lit club, the automatic chase of her mother down a crowded walkway. And before that, the clawing her way into the world, and the bitter bite-lock to stay in it. </p><p>She’d never considered it until now, that sometime as she grew, she’d sunk deep into the dirt and overwintered, like a soft, cornered creature. The muscles pulled beneath her scapulae, opposite her floating ribs, where her gaudy wings were supposed to be.</p><p>She’d fallen under the weight of her body’s betrayal, and picked herself up. She’d thought that was the way it was supposed to be. A girl who raised herself, and learned to tame her hair and then her heart. She’d pretended not to hear the things her body whispered to her, until she'd forgotten how to hear it at all. She’d never considered that all along, it was <em> she </em>who had betrayed her body, instead. </p><p>And now, standing in front of the corn dog cart, saturated with lemonade and the understanding that something had changed, it was the only thing she could hear. From her wet, sticky skin to the delicate tubes and cavities in her inner ear: <em>Go.</em></p><p>The sound of the food court hit her at full volume, the colors coming in harsh and bright again. Wanda was still saying something, and she couldn’t make out the words, and she didn’t care.</p><p>“Josh,” Agatha said, “Do you have Nicky?”</p><p>“He’s still on—”</p><p>“I’m asking—” she stopped. Her voice shook. “I need you. To tell him I’m coming back.”</p><p>“Yes. Of course, yeah,” Josh said, nodding. “I got him.”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>It was Wanda. Agatha backed away, and finally, as she was still moving, looked at her. </p><p>Her face had gone pale.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Agatha managed, and then she ran.</p><p> </p><hr/><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Agatha dodged strollers and slow-walking families, and tried to catch her breath. She wasn’t moving all that fast, but the memory of it squeezed her lungs, the panic of scanning a crowd for someone who’d left. </p><p>Finally, she stopped. She shut her eyes, and put her hands over her ears. The sound faded around her.</p><p>
<em> Where would Rio go? </em>
</p><p>She would go somewhere secluded. Somewhere dark. Somewhere she felt like she belonged. Agatha thought of an empty auditorium, a sewing machine in a costume closet, a front yard and an axe in the dark of night. She thought of hot stage lights, and bachata, and Rio’s hands tying fabric at her waist. She opened her eyes, and walked four steps back the way she came. To her left, a blue door read: </p><p>
<b> <em>Cast Members Only</em> </b>
</p><p>She tugged the door—<em>unlocked</em>. She let out a quiet laugh of disbelief, and ducked inside. She prepared herself to blend in, but the room was empty. A dressing room, she realized. She turned slowly, surveying the space, and another door caught her eye.</p><p>
<em> <strong> Costume Closet</strong> </em>
</p><p>Agatha knew. She didn’t know <em> how </em>she knew, but she knew. She didn’t believe in clairvoyance, but she was so unreasonably sure, it made her freeze. She’d made it this far with pure luck and panic, and she didn’t know what to even begin to say.</p><p>Her body moved toward the door, and she let it. She slipped inside, and shut it behind her. And maybe Lilia had been right about everything, because maybe now, Agatha believed in clairvoyance. Rio was pacing at the other end of the small room. The light was minimal, the cement walls lined with floor-to-ceiling racks. Costume dresses and accessories hung in colorful, neat sections along the sides. Rio stood in front of a particularly eerie shelf of character heads. Goofy, Mickey, Pluto, and Donald Duck were positioned like sentries behind her, a nightmarish line of defense across the back wall. The eyes stared down at Agatha, mouths open in vacant smiles, and Agatha stared back. She waited for words to come, but none did. She just looked at Rio, at her flushed cheeks, and eyes still bright with anger. </p><p>“Why are you here?” Rio snapped. </p><p>“What do you mean, <em> why am I here</em>?” Agatha looked at her incredulously. “You just fucking…” She trailed off, the words escaping her again.</p><p>“I know what I did.” Rio crossed her arms. “I’m not going to apologize.”</p><p>“Look, I’ll talk to Wanda, and you can talk to her tomorrow, and we can—”</p><p>“I’m not going to get on my knees and beg to keep my job, Agatha,” Rio was furious again. “You think I’m going to plead and hope that she can find it in herself to see an ounce of humanity in a lowly, piece-of-trash stripper? I respect myself more than that. And I really fucking thought you did, too.”</p><p>“Rio.” Agatha took a careful step towards her. </p><p>“No.” The word burst out of Rio, voice echoing off the walls, and Agatha froze. “I don’t want you to try and fix this, okay? I don’t want—” Her voice caught, and she swallowed. </p><p>Agatha watched her, the panic evident on her features, and this wasn’t the Rio she knew. <em> Rio </em> didn’t let strangers’ insults unravel her. <em> Rio </em>didn’t dump garlic fries on their heads, or yell at them in a food court. Those were Agatha’s moves. This was the Rio from the bar last night, arms cinched tight around her, terrified.</p><p>Rio didn’t want her to fix this. She didn’t want it to be fixed at all. She wanted to fulfill a future she’d never outgrown, the one handed to the girl outside a gas station in handcuffs, or in a hospital bed. The girl who’d been told she was the devil, and believed it.</p><p>Just like she’d known what was behind the costume closet door, Agatha knew what question to ask. She felt it at her teeth, and didn’t know how to resist herself anymore. So she let it pass, over her tongue and into the room with the disembodied heads.</p><p>“How was the job interview?”</p><p>Agatha saw the words hit her. Rio closed her eyes. She wiped a hand over her face, and held the hair off of her forehead for a second, and breathed. And then she opened her eyes.</p><p>Her face twitched, like it might shift or break into something different at any second. Agatha realized she was holding her breath.</p><p>“It was good,” she said, voice tight.</p><p>Agatha let out a breath. “Okay, so what’s the problem? Why are you—”</p><p>“They offered me the job.”</p><p>Agatha felt the ground tilt under her for a second. And her first, insane, mind-fucking thought was: <em> But I can’t move to California. </em></p><p>And then she realized what she’d thought. She felt her walls slam into place with sudden, dizzying force. The old teeth were back, jaws pried open in her chest, salivating for a bite.</p><p>“<em>That’s </em> why you freaked out?” she said, her voice menacing to her own ears. “You just got offered your dream job, and you’re trying to fuck it up before it goes wrong on its own, so that it will never go right. Fucking classic, Rio. Seems like that’s been working out really well for you.”</p><p>Rio’s face twisted. “I freaked out because McKenna is a raging bitch. If we weren’t at Disneyland, I swear to fucking god, she’d have a broken nose.”</p><p>“Since fucking <em> when </em> do you care what people say about you?” Agatha yelled, her arms flailing, hands pulling at her own hair. “Your pride was so wounded by one little insult that you had to fuck up your entire career <em> and mine</em>?”</p><p>Rio was silent now, her jaw set. Her nose flared, shoulders squaring.</p><p>“It wasn’t just today,” Rio said. “It was yesterday, too.”</p><p>Agatha stared. “<em>So fucking what</em>?” </p><p>“Agatha, she was talking about <em> you</em>!”</p><p>The volume of Rio’s voice echoed metallic against the racks, and Agatha blinked. The air went cold against her damp skin. Goosebumps prickling up her arms.</p><p>“What do you—” she swallowed. “What did she say?”</p><p>Rio shook her head. “You don’t want to know.”</p><p>Agatha took another step closer, her throat feeling tight. “Rio,” she said. “Tell me.”</p><p>Rio was clenching her jaw, eyes flashing, and her hands clenched and unclenched at her side.</p><p>“She asked Josh if you get the sad ex-wife discount. When you pay me to fuck you.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach twisted at the words, throat tightening at the cruelty of it. She thought of the slow walk to the snack table, blood on her thighs. Twizzlers clenched in her fist, and tears held back. Her pride holding fast against the onslaught of shame.</p><p>And now, too, there was something besides the shame. Something warm, and alive, and in the way.</p><p>“That’s why you…” Agatha cleared her throat, her voice feeling scratchy. </p><p>Rio looked away, and Agatha felt that something alive growing more restless, kicking at her.</p><p>“That’s why you threw garlic fries at her head? And said those things about Nicky?”</p><p>“At the pool, she–” Rio gritted her teeth. “She told Josh you were a bad mother.” </p><p>She said it plainly, evenly, but Agatha could still hear the tremor in her voice. </p><p>Her skin felt too tight.</p><p>“You’re a fucking incredible mother, Agatha,” Rio said, ferocity creeping steadily back into her tone. “And teacher. And if she thinks she can just fucking—”</p><p>Agatha didn’t wait for her to finish. With towering racks on her left and right, her cheeks tinged red from the sun, she softened her claws in the dark, as they reached for dry land. She crossed the space in two wide steps, held Rio’s face in her hands, and kissed her. </p><p>Her heart stuttered in her chest. She pressed her feverish, lemonade-sticky body flush against Rio's, backwards into the metal. Rio stumbled and let out a muffled sound, hands falling to Agatha’s hips instinctively, and didn’t move her lips for long enough that Agatha started to feel light-headed. And then her mouth opened, and Agatha breathed.</p><p>Rio tasted like popcorn and cotton candy, and Agatha could smell the water on her own skin. It was sweet and chemical, like lychee and cherries and pool-wet hair on a rainy day. Agatha knew, like how the combination of sunscreen and hairspray reminded her of summer, that sugar and chlorine would always remind her of Rio. The thought pulled at her, the knowledge there was something irrevocable here. And even still, she didn’t stop. </p><p>Her hands were everywhere at once as her lips pried at Rio’s, tracing her neck, stroking fingers down her sides, pressing into her hips. She opened her mouth, and Rio’s tongue slid against hers. Agatha hummed, the sound needy, and then Rio paused. She pulled back an inch, eyes still shut. Agatha heard her own ragged breath against Rio’s mouth.</p><p>Rio stroked her thumbs over Agatha’s temples. </p><p>“Agatha."</p><p>It was that tone Agatha recognized, and this time she couldn’t blame it on the weed. It was a warning: the blink-and-you-might-miss-it edge that she was barely holding back.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha breathed against her lips in quiet challenge, and watched her eyelashes flutter. Agatha swallowed, the heat already pooling deep in her belly. She nudged her nose against Rio’s. Slowly, deliberately, she took Rio’s bottom lip between her teeth, and pulled.</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened, then darkened, and Agatha was spinning, her back pressed up against the metal rack. Rio held her there, her lips relentless and bruising, hands trailing over Agatha’s wet tank top. She kissed her until Agatha was making little sounds, somewhere between a breath and a whine, and pressing her hips forward. Rio thumbed at her sticky collarbone, lips trailing down her jaw and latching on to her neck. </p><p>“No—” she gasped, tugging at Rio's hair. “No marks.”</p><p>Rio growled in frustration and pushed her hands beneath Agatha’s shirt instead. She paused there for a second, thumbs stroking over the skin of her stomach, and licked at the hollow of her throat.</p><p>Agatha let out a breathless whine, louder this time, her head hitting the rack behind her. Rio made a noise against her collarbone—a hum, or maybe a word—and Agatha wanted to hear it again and again. She wanted to hear everything. She wanted to see Rio come apart, but they didn’t have enough time, and she didn’t know what the fuck she was doing. At least not enough to make that happen in a closet in twenty minutes, if she even lasted that long. </p><p>Rio’s thumb grazed a nipple over the fabric of her bra, and even that was enough to make Agatha’s hips jerk. Rio smirked against her mouth, and did it again.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha breathed. “Don’t fucking—” she broke off into a gasp as Rio trailed her hand over the front of Agatha’s shorts.</p><p>Agatha ground her hips, trying to meet her hand, and Rio moved it just out of the way.</p><p>“What do you say?” Rio said, smirk wide on her lips. Agatha stared stubbornly through lidded eyes.</p><p>“Touch me,” she tried to command, her voice rasping. It sounded weak to her own ears.</p><p>Rio leaned in, breathing over her lips. “Touch me, <em> what</em>?”</p><p>She pressed up again with the heel of her hand, and Agatha tried and failed to cage her whimper. Rio smirked, and did it again, this time with the light press of only three finger pads.</p><p>“Please,” Agatha breathed automatically. “Please, fuck, please.”</p><p>She didn’t have time to be embarrassed about the unusual lack of resistance in her limbs. She'd gone soft and hot and stretchy under Rio’s touch, like taffy left in the sun. Her knees were already shaking.</p><p>Rio hummed low like she knew, knuckles brushing her skin as she undid the button, and slid her hand under the waistband. Agatha let out a sharp, shaky sound, as she felt Rio’s fingers against her and fought the urge to close her eyes. Rio was watching her, fingers teasing, stroking slow circles, and the intensity of her gaze made Agatha’s head spin.</p><p>They didn’t have time for this, she thought vaguely. She wanted Rio’s fingers inside her, to know what those familiar hands felt like when they did what they were meant to. And then, to her absolute horror, with Rio's hand down her pants and her lips on her jaw, Agatha thought about her gynecologist.</p><p>It wasn't in a hot, <em> fantasize-about-your-doctor </em> kind of way. Instead, she thought about her stupid phone call, and the words <em> vaginal dryness</em>, and her question spilling out of her, drunk and self-conscious: <em> what if I’m bad at it? </em></p><p><em> Not right now</em>, she chanted to herself. She wanted Rio now. She could think about it later. <em> Later, later, later.  </em></p><p>She felt Rio’s hand still, and realized her eyes were screwed shut. </p><p>“Hey,” Rio said softly. Agatha opened her eyes, and Rio was looking at her carefully. “Maybe we should stop.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha breathed, grabbing her wrist to keep it in place against her. “No.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio said, her chest rising and falling. She placed an open-mouthed kiss at Agatha’s jaw, just under her ear, and whispered, “Then tell me what you need.”</p><p>Agatha hummed at the feel of her lips, the feel of her hand. She never wanted to stop feeling this. <em> That </em>was what she needed. She wanted to be soft and stretchy all of the time, for Rio to be able to reach inside her and pull and take whatever and whenever she wanted. But that wasn’t something she knew how to say.</p><p>“I don’t suppose you have a travel-sized bottle of lube in your back pocket,” she said instead, jaw clenched in frustration. </p><p>Rio leaned back to look at her in surprise, and then her eyes settled on understanding.</p><p>“Sorry,” Agatha said automatically, the self-ridicule rising hot and bitter in the back of her mouth. </p><p>Rio traced her free hand slowly across Agatha’s jaw, down her neck, and rested it at her throat. She leaned forward and kissed her lightly. Agatha felt time slow. Rio nudged nose, tilted her head, and kissed her deeper. Her hand was frozen still where Agatha held it. Her tongue stroked the inside of Agatha’s mouth with light, teasing passes until Agatha was panting and squirming against her again.</p><p>Rio leaned back, and her eyes held that dangerous gleam. This was<em> the look</em>, Agatha knew. The look she gave women as she danced on their laps, that made them come apart under her. The look she’d meant to destroy, that had taken root instead, and pushed through the cracks in the driveway. It was the look that had grown into something hardy and new, weaving together with their faces to the sun, like the family <em> Asteraceae: a</em> thistle, a sunflower, and a dandelion. Agatha <em> wanted</em>. </p><p>“Let go,” Rio said, and Agatha’s fingers dropped automatically. Rio withdrew her hand from the water-damp denim, and Agatha tried not to whimper at the loss of it.</p><p>She closed her eyes. She thought about leaving this dingy closet. She thought about calling Pepper and cursing her out for letting her ask her stupid questions, and for giving her real answers. She wished she could call her dead mother, too, and tell her it wasn’t fair, what she’d done to her—leaving her alone to learn how to be a girl, and then a woman, and then a whole, complete person. It had been impossible. It was still impossible.</p><p>She tried to steady her breathing so that she could say <em> something</em>. What, she didn’t know. </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said, her voice breathless and low. “Open your eyes.”</p><p>Agatha did. The sight nearly brought her to her knees. Rio was looking at her, one hand braced on the rack behind Agatha’s shoulder, the other hand out of sight, moving beneath the waistband of her own green shorts.</p><p>Agatha gasped, her breath a sharp exhale, because <em> this</em> was quite possibly the hottest thing she’d seen in her entire life. All she could see was the movement of Rio’s hand under the fabric, slow and methodical, the way her mouth opened slightly, eyes fluttering.</p><p>And then, she stopped. She pulled her hand from her shorts, and held it up for Agatha to see. Her fingers glistened in the low light, and Agatha leaned forward automatically, mouth open. Rio pressed a hand on her chest, and shook her head. Agatha watched, confused, as Rio lowered her hand again. And then, she understood. </p><p>“Jesus, fuck,” she breathed, the heat rising on her face, spreading up her arms and down her legs, her hair feeling too hot on her neck. Rio reached into denim again, and circled her wet fingers around Agatha’s clit. </p><p>Agatha let out a cry she didn’t know she was holding in, gripping Rio’s shirt at the sides. Rio teased slow, and Agatha grasped at her wrist, needing her to move faster. And every time she pulled at Rio’s hand, Rio took it away, and touched herself instead.</p><p>Agatha lost count, her head permanently back against the metal as Rio’s hand left and returned, left and returned, until she was sure she was soaking through the suffocating layers of cotton and denim and the gaps between Rio’s fingers. She didn’t know how much was her, and how much was Rio, and the thought alone made her moan, long and low.</p><p>“Rio,” she gasped again, and this time, she kept her hands anchored firmly on Rio’s t-shirt. “Inside. <em>Now</em>.”</p><p>Rio looked at her, eyes boring into hers, and took mercy. Agatha wondered whether it was because they had no time, or because she couldn’t wait any longer, either. Rio pushed a finger in, slow, and once she added a second, Agatha stopped wondering altogether. She squirmed, trying to pull her in deeper.</p><p>“<em>Rio</em>,” she whined, and she knew she was begging, and she couldn’t find it in her to be appalled at herself, because who in their right mind wouldn’t beg for this? Only Rio’s steady grip kept her from falling to her knees. She would have done it, though—fallen to her knees, in reverence or repentance, whatever would keep her here.</p><p>Agatha clawed at Rio’s shirt, at her sides, at her back, pulling her. She needed Rio to <em> move</em>. </p><p>She couldn’t be sure, her mind flitting and jumping from one thought into the next, but she guessed that was why she said it. Why she mumbled open-mouthed against Rio’s neck: “I was wearing your t-shirt.”</p><p>She knew it was the wrong thing to say, because Rio stopped moving. Agatha let out a cry of despair, and twisted her hips to no avail.</p><p>“What?” Rio’s voice was a low rumble against her ear, and Agatha shivered.</p><p>Agatha twisted again, fruitlessly. “Lilia gave it to me when I went to find you, that day, and then we fought, and then—” she rushed to get the words out, breathless. “When I fucked Paul—”</p><p>Rio breathed sharply in her ear, and she drove her fingers deep. Agatha gasped, and then whined again at the pause. And then, still panting, she pulled Rio’s head back by the hair, and looked her in the eye. </p><p>“I kept the shirt on,” she finished, fingers curling into her scalp.</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>,” Rio breathed, dropping her forehead to Agatha’s shoulder. Agatha was torn—she wanted Rio to come apart against her. But when she did, her hand stopped moving, and Agatha clenched her thighs together in case Rio thought about pulling her fingers away again. </p><p>Nowhere in the godforsaken pamphlet had it mentioned <em>this</em>. She supposed she couldn’t be absolutely sure about the health risks, but she was fairly certain that if she didn’t come in the next five minutes, she was going to die. Rio seemed to gather herself, and started a ruthless pace with her hand. Agatha cried out again, fingers curling tighter into Rio’s hair, her other arm braced behind her as she knocked against metal.</p><p>“Did you think about me?” Rio said, biting at her jaw. There was an edge to her voice, molten and mean. “When you were fucking him, did you think about me?” </p><p>Her voice was raw and bare, and Agatha was overwhelmed by the sound of it. The animalistic rasp, the steady drive of her fingers, filling and stretching her. Her eyes fluttered shut. But still, she managed to find the sharp bite of her own pride, because she would never go down quiet. She'd never quite learned how.</p><p>“Do you think about me when Kate’s boring you to death with her tongue?”</p><p>“I asked first,” Rio said, and withdrew her fingers almost entirely. Agatha could feel it, the millimeter of fingertips inside her, and then nothing. She cried out, trying to push down, but Rio held her steady.</p><p>“No, no, please,” Agatha breathed. “Yes.” Rio pushed up, just barely.</p><p>“Which is it?” Rio said. She bit down on her earlobe. “Yes or no?”</p><p>“<em>Yes</em>,” Agatha said, “Yes, Yes, I—” and then cried out as Rio buried her fingers to the knuckle. She wanted to tell her. Wanted to detail out every last image that had flitted through her brain as she’d come undone, but what came out instead was: “Want to touch you.” </p><p>She wanted everything at once, and it didn’t make sense for where they were standing, and how much time they had, and the logistics of it all. But really, she couldn’t have cared less about the logistics of it all.</p><p>Rio stilled again for a second. Agatha gripped her sides. “I want to know what you—” she swallowed, her voice thick. “I want to know.”</p><p>Rio seemed to soften at that. She pulled Agatha’s hand to her waistband, never stopping the steady thrust of her own hand, angling her so she didn’t get in the way.</p><p>Agatha could feel the goosebumps like tiny fireworks across her skin, her legs and arms starting to tingle with each drive of Rio’s hand, each curl of her fingers. She slipped her hand under Rio’s shorts, messy and uncoordinated. It was selfishness, really, that right now, this far gone, she wanted to feel what she was doing to Rio. It was some desperate, narcissistic part of her that wanted more proof than Rio’s fingers held up to the light.</p><p>And when her hand slipped through damp curls and found wet heat, she moaned loudly against Rio’s hair. The sound pulled, deep and involuntary from the back of her throat. Rio gasped against her neck. </p><p>“Fuck, don’t—” Rio said suddenly, voice low and unsteady. “Don’t move.”</p><p>Through her want-addled mind, Agatha was confused. And then she registered the jerky twist of Rio’s fingers, the panting breaths against her neck, the way she was pushing her own hips forward with every thrust, and the realization slammed into her. Rio was as close as Agatha was, only having touched herself in that wrecking display of simple offering.</p><p>Agatha said something like a string of<em> YesYesYesFuckYes</em>, and then, out of nowhere, she felt that ever-present pit of longing and loss open up inside her. She didn’t know why now, with Rio’s fingers inside her, but <em> yes </em> turned to <em> no, don’t stop, please don’t stop. </em></p><p>Agatha clutched Rio tighter, her own palm still flat against her, wet and warm and aching to move, but she didn’t. Rio had said not to. </p><p>Rio dropped her head to Agatha’s shoulder again, and her other hand rested low against Agatha’s stomach, pushing lightly, and Agatha said, “<em>Please</em>, baby, don’t stop.”</p><p>She didn’t realize she’d said it until it was too late. That word had left her lips hundreds of times, in hundreds of ways, but never once by accident. Rio stilled at the word, canting her hips against both of their hands trapped between them, and whimpered once in Agatha’s ear. It was a soft, harsh cry, quiet and gutting, and Agatha felt her shake. She realized her slip of the tongue had pushed Rio over the edge entirely, and she was coming against Agatha’s unmoving hand.</p><p>Agatha felt the spike of pleasure, less like the crescendo of a wave and more like the casualty of a head-on collision. She came around Rio's fingers, no doubt on the heels of the realization that she’d just made <em>Rio</em> come by doing absolutely nothing. Because underneath the thick and peeling layers of self-doubt, she’d always been self-centered, in the way she should have always been allowed. </p><p>The cry that ripped from her own throat was unholy, unwomanly, un-everything she’d ever thought to become. The force it of clenched her thighs shut, and her own fingers pressed messily into Rio. </p><p>As her body shook and her back bowed, Agatha thought of moths, and the life cycle of a mimic. Not the pink moth, sipping from flowers under the full moon, and not the caterpillar playacting a snake. Instead, she thought of the picture in between—the warped shaped emerging from the leaf layer with papery wings. She trembled against Rio and thought of that crumpled creature, new and wet with hemolymph, its legs dripping with the strange, sticky blue of invertebrate blood.</p><p>Rio panted against Agatha’s throat, breath uneven, and moved her hand diligently as Agatha came down slowly. Agatha finally regained her breath, hand pressed into Rio's side. She felt the ribs expanding, contracting, slowing. The false set and the true. She pulled her other hand from Rio’s shorts, and Rio withdrew her fingers yet again. They untangled slowly, piece by piece, as if each unsticking stung their clammy skin. It reminded her of the slow peel of a bandaid from an open wound, or the unzipping of a purple dress.</p><p>She let go of Rio’s shirt, finally, and Rio stepped back. She glanced at her hand, and her eyes widened. The corners of her mouth twitched, and Agatha followed her gaze. A sheen of rust red covered her index and middle, diluted but unmistakable.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha said. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Don’t be,” she said, and licked her lips. </p><p>Agatha felt a pull in her gut, like she was ready to do the last twenty minutes all over again, even though they really needed to go, and deal with the fact that they were both probably getting fired. She took half a step forward.</p><p>The sound of a key in the door made them both freeze, heads snapping toward the entryway. Agatha zipped up her shorts as quickly as she could, hands still shaking. Rio looked around wildly, then wiped her fingers on the cheek of Donald Duck’s decapitated head.</p><p>“Jesus,” Agatha muttered. “Some kid’s going to need therapy.”</p><p>Rio shrugged, face perfectly straight, and said, “Not enough time to use my mouth."</p><p>Agatha stared, trying to form any sort of response and coming up blatantly empty.</p><p>The light flooded in, and framed a man in the doorway dressed head to toe as a Disney prince.</p><p>“Wow, a <em> real </em> prince,” Rio exclaimed, and Agatha tried not to laugh as the man dropped his keys. “Thank you so much for saving us. What would we do without you?”</p><p>“Laying it on a little thick,” Agatha muttered as they squeezed past him. Rio grinned.</p><p>Agatha felt a smile tug at her lips for a second—half a second, maybe—before the dread slammed into her stomach. She paused as the light hit her eyes from the open door, one foot still inside the dressing room. </p><p>Rio’s eyebrows furrowed, and twitched, and she looked back at Agatha. The sun landed on her face, cheeks flushed and lips swollen, and she shielded her eyes against the light. She bit at the side of her cheek.</p><p>“I know,” she said. That was all, and then she turned.</p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Agatha woke before it was light, her head pounding. She wondered if her hangover was one day delayed, or if she was hungover from something else entirely. She walked to the bathroom, sore from the sun, and from Rio. She looked at herself under the harsh fluorescence. Forty-three didn’t look any different.</p><p>She walked back out, and stared at the painting over the bed, the one with the river and the mountain. She tilted her head and tried to figure out why it looked different. Then she looked at Nicky, curled up next to the space she’d left in the sheets. She stroked his hair as he stirred.</p><p>“Morning,” she smiled, and he blinked slow, thumb finding his mouth.</p><p>“Thumb,” she chided softly, and held onto it. He only half heard, his eyes fluttering shut again. She leaned down, and whispered, “How about we go get some Mickey Waffles? Just you and me.”</p><p>His eyes opened then, and he grinned. “Yeah,” he said at full volume, and she clapped her hands. </p><p>“Okay—brush your teeth, and meet me back here in five minutes!” she commanded, and laughed as he tumbled out of bed. </p><p>“Aye aye, captain,” he said, running the three small steps to the bathroom.</p><p>She perched on the edge of the bed, and looked into the mirror across the room, trying to find even one thing different in her reflection. A new wrinkle, maybe, or a gray hair. She caught the reflection of the painting instead. The mountain stood right and the river flowed backwards, the way she remembered they should.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>They made it to the diner around the corner with their pajamas still on.</p><p>“We’ll split the Mickey Waffles,” Agatha said to the waiter, and he squinted.</p><p>“We're not affiliated with the park, so for licensing purposes, are you referring to the <em> Mouse Waffles</em>?”</p><p>“I’m not calling them that.”</p><p>“Okay,” he said uncertainly. “But... that is what you want, right?”</p><p>“I want waffles in the shape of Mickey Mouse’s head,” Agatha said. “I want whipped cream on it, and if you have some candles, stick a few in the middle. And if you let us eat them uninterrupted, I’ll tip you an unreasonable amount.”</p><p>The waiter nodded nervously, and escaped to the kitchen.</p><p>“Mama, look.”</p><p>Nicky was dropping water on the straw wrapper to make it crawl.</p><p>“That’s very cool,” she said. “Where’d you learn that one?”</p><p>“Ms. V taught me,” Nicky said, concentrating on his aim. The water dripped to the side of the paper, and he tried again.</p><p>Agatha swallowed.</p><p>“How was dinner with Dad?” she asked.</p><p>Nicky frowned at the wrapper, now saturated with water.</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>“What’d you eat?”</p><p>“French fries and chicken nuggets,” he said, dropping the straw. “Oh, and then Daddy got me this cupcake that was so big, and had a candle on it that said the number eight, and then I had to say eight things I love to do.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, and felt the punch of guilt. “Sorry I missed it,” she muttered, chin in hand. </p><p>“That’s okay,” he said, “don’t even worry about it.”</p><p>“'Don’t even worry about it?'” She laughed. “We’ve been in California three days—am I losing my son to the laid-back culture of the Golden State?”</p><p>He giggled, then paused. “No. I miss our house. And my bed and toys. And my friends. And school.”</p><p>"Hmm. Well, sounds like you have a lot to look forward to.”</p><p>He nodded as the waiter returned, with a plate stacked with normal, Mickey-Mouse-shaped waffles. In the center sat two blue candles.</p><p>“One order of Mouse Waffles for the birthday boy!”</p><p>He set the plate down between them, and opened his mouth, brows raised. “Haaaa—”</p><p>Agatha held up her hand, still watching Nicky.</p><p>“Do you want him to sing Happy Birthday?”</p><p>Nicky looked at her, and then at the waiter, who was paused mid-word.</p><p>“No,” Nicky said casually, and looked at her. “Can we sing it instead?”</p><p>Agatha smiled, then glared at the waiter until he walked away</p><p>They sang to each other in the empty diner, the sun rising through the windows. She said “dear Nicky,” and he said, “dear Mama,” and they blew out the candles at once.</p><p>“Mama, how old are you?” Nicky asked some time later, mouth covered in syrup, waffle in his hand whole like a piece of toast.</p><p>“Forty-three,” she said, widening her eyes.</p><p>“That’s old.”</p><p>She laughed. A week ago, it would have hit her in a different way. But right now, she was with her favorite person in a diner at sunrise, and maybe forty-three didn’t look different, but it certainly felt it.</p><p>“How old is Daddy?” Nicky asked, mouth full.</p><p>“Forty-four.”</p><p>“That’s old, too. What about Ms. V?”</p><p>“Thirty.”</p><p>“Why is everyone so old?” He held his hands out to emphasize his point, and she couldn’t help but laugh again.</p><p>“You’re old, now, too, you know,” she said, pointing at the candles. “Eight? That’s getting up there.”</p><p>“Yeah,” he said, and took another big bite. He chewed for a minute, lost in thought, and then froze.</p><p>“When does Santa stop coming?” he said, pupils wide in sudden worry.</p><p>“Not when you’re eight.”</p><p>Agatha watched the two old men in the opposite booth, the only other patrons in the diner, as they sat together in comfortable silence. The smaller man sipped his coffee, eyes on the newspaper. The other stared quietly out the window. Agatha wondered if they were friends or lovers. She wondered why both options made her throat feel tight.</p><p>“I have a question for you,” she said, turning back to Nicky. She glanced at him, and then back to the plate. The syrup pooled on the side. She moved it around uselessly with her fork.</p><p>“You like Ms. V, right?”</p><p>“Uh-huh,” Nicky nodded, distracted by a bright orange car out the window.</p><p>“Why? What do you like about her?”</p><p>Nicky looked at her and shrugged. “She’s nice. She taught me and Luca how to do a dance. And we talk about Mario Kart sometimes. She’s, like, really good—she knows all the shortcuts.”</p><p>“What?” Agatha said, baffled. “When did you play Mario Kart with her?”</p><p>“On rainy day lunch in the library,” he said. “Luca had his switch and we took turns, and Ms. V showed us this crazy path with the dinosaurs that we never even saw before.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, the image of Rio with her head bent over a video game between two little boys. She knew Rio’s brow would’ve been furrowed in concentration, tongue between her teeth. </p><p>“So you like her because she plays with you?”</p><p>“Yeah,” he said, like it was obvious. And really, she didn’t know what she’d been expecting. Eight year-olds weren’t exactly known for their sentimentality. Kids never wielded any reasons <em>why</em> they liked adults, they just did or didn’t. </p><p>“Do <em> you </em>like Ms. V?” Nicky asked her back, and she raised her eyebrows. </p><p>“Yeah,” she said after a beat. “I really do.”</p><p>He considered, and tilted his head.</p><p>“Did you guys ever play Mario Kart?” he asked. </p><p>Agatha laughed, her chest bubbling with sudden warmth. </p><p>“No,” she said finally. “I don’t think I’m there yet. But if we do, I’m going to need you to drive for me—you know how I am with those games.”</p><p>“You’re so bad at it,” Nicky giggled, and she dropped her mouth open. </p><p>“Hey!”</p><p>“You always go backwards.”</p><p>His sides shook with laughter. She laughed with him, and for a second, she forgot. She forgot about all of it, except her best little friend, and mouse waffles, and big-kid sounds of happiness.</p><p> </p><hr/><p>

<br/>
</p><p>Wanda was waiting for them in the parking lot of the diner. She leaned against the rental van, arms crossed, and Agatha froze as they stepped onto the pavement.</p><p>“Aunt Wanda!” Nicky called, and ran to her. "We had Micky Waffles!"</p><p>Agatha watched them hug, Wanda’s hair backlit a dazzling red. Agatha had called her <em> Little Red</em>, that first year, when she’d still thought she could make Wanda an enemy if she just tried hard enough.</p><p>Agatha walked slowly toward her, shivering. Her thin pajama pants did nothing to block the morning chill.</p><p>“Mama, I have to go to the bathroom.”</p><p>“Okay,” she said, relieved. “Let’s go.”</p><p>“Can I go by myself?”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Oh. Yeah. You can.” She tried to sound normal about the fact that this was the first time he’d ever asked that in a public place. “If you’re not out in five minutes, I’m coming in swinging.”</p><p>Nicky grinned and ran back inside. She watched the diner door jangle shut behind him. Maybe eight felt different than seven, the same way forty-three felt different than forty-two.</p><p>The tears came out of nowhere. She pulled the neckline of her t-shirt over her face and let a few tears fall, her throat tight with the effort of staying silent.</p><p>“Agatha.” Wanda’s soft voice cut through the quiet. Agatha dropped her t-shirt, the salt and air stinging her cheeks.</p><p>“You can’t fire her.” The words tumbled out, rough and too loud. It was still early enough that she could see her breath escape with them.</p><p>“Agatha—”</p><p>“She’s a good teacher. You know she is. Or you wouldn’t have gotten her that interview. She’s already lost a career once, and no one should have to do that twice.”</p><p>“That’s not fair.” Wanda's voice wavered, and Agatha’s chest clenched at the sound of it. “They want to know she’s someone I stand behind. I have to <em> sign off </em> on it! She lied to me. <em> You </em>lied to me.”</p><p>Agatha flinched. She watched the traffic as Wanda continued.</p><p>“And what about you? Your classroom? How am I supposed to trust that you know how to separate…” She stopped herself. “<em>Whatever </em> this is.”</p><p>“Wanda, it’s—”</p><p>“Agatha, if you say ‘complicated’ one more fucking time—”</p><p>Agatha fell silent. She looked at Wanda, her fire-lit flyaways and the crease between her eyebrows. She noticed the faint lines on her face that had appeared sometime in the last six years. No doubt from the last eight months, cleaning up Agatha’s trail of debris. </p><p>Agatha felt the guilt squeeze her. She could say it—<em>I fucked Rio. </em>But somehow, thinking it so plainly felt wrong and incomplete. How could she explain the feeling of Rio’s hands on her in the dark, her hooded eyes fluttering shut? She didn’t have the words. She wasn’t sure the words existed.</p><p>“Okay,” she said instead, and felt something harden in her chest. “Let’s make a deal, then.” </p><p>The crease between Wanda’s eyebrows grew deeper. Agatha took a deep, steadying breath, and felt the air still. She was too many miles past the first sign of crisis.</p><p>“She’ll quit the club,” Agatha said. “Give me one week. And you sign off, or call them, or do wherever it is you need to do to make sure the offer sticks. <em> Before </em>you leave for the airport.”</p><p>Wanda let out a defeated sound. “You’re in no position to bargain. You should’ve stopped this the <em> second </em> you knew. You should have <em> told me </em> the second—”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>They were silent then. Agatha watched the cars rolling by, people on their way to work on a Monday morning while she was here, in the parking lot of a diner, in shambles. It felt odd, that the world would be spinning, business as usual. </p><p>“She flew home early, you know,” Wanda said finally, glancing at her. “Last night.” </p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped, and she tried to keep her face even. Wanda reached out and touched her arm. Agatha wanted with her whole body to melt into it. She stood with her back straight instead, and kept the warmth from Wanda’s hand confined to the cold air of the parking lot.</p><p>“There’s a question I’m not asking,” Wanda said quietly. “And it’s killing me not to ask.”</p><p>“Don’t.” Agatha shook her head. She pulled away, and jostled her legs to keep warm. She hugged her arms to her chest so that Wanda wouldn’t try to touch her again. To try and soften her.</p><p>“Please, don’t. I can’t—not right now.”</p><p>She heard the jangle of the diner door, and Nicky was pushing the door open with great effort. Agatha felt her eyes drop in an automatic check for his wet hands.</p><p>“There are things more important than my job,” Wanda said. “You’re my best friend. And I’m just…” She swallowed, and shook her head again. “I’m just trying to be your best friend.”</p><p>Agatha forced the words to roll off of her, like water on wax. She looked at Wanda, staring back at her—a mirror image, with arms and legs and eye sockets, floating ribs and all. She wondered what pieces of Wanda’s life were notched into her spine. If Agatha’s initials were carved there, the way best friends were supposed to be, or if it was just a mess of scratch marks and tallies, marking the days until she was freed from all of this. From Agatha.</p><p>“Do we have a deal?” Agatha asked, eyes meeting Wanda’s.</p><p>Wanda’s eyebrows twitched, face settling into clear disappointment. She stepped back. Something soft and whole pulled back with her. Agatha felt cold again.</p><p>“Yeah, okay,” Wanda said. “Fine. One week.”</p><p>“One week,” Agatha repeated. </p><p>She turned towards her car, and ignored the twinge of soreness in her back and legs. She pushed away the memory of Rio’s hands on her stomach, and cradling her face, and coated in her own blood that had surely, willingly exposed the truth of her.</p><p>She ignored the desperate promise she’d just made, the solution that had presented itself with seeming clarity, and was now starting to make her stomach ache. She ignored the mimicked snake rearing its head once more. With one more shallow breath, she crossed the asphalt, her baby’s hand in hers.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>

<b>I. SATURDAY</b>
</p><p align="center"> </p><p>When Josh moved out that July afternoon, the first thing Agatha thought was: <em> I’m ordering Thai food for dinner. </em>She knew that wasn’t what she was supposed to consider. She was supposed to cry in her driveway and think of Nicky, or holiday plans, or even the broken-up set of antique lamps. But coping, as always, took the path of least resistance: Josh hated Thai food, and now Josh was gone. </p><p>Truthfully, that day in her driveway, she’d thought they’d lived separate lives long enough that the separating itself would come easy. She figured the details would work themselves out eventually, with all the other <em> Serious Things To Be Considered</em>. So when he finally pulled out of the driveway, she scratched the mosquito bite on her arm and thought about Pad See Ew.</p><p>It was embarrassing how little she’d anticipated the logistics of divorce. Who’d take the Netflix account?<em> (Josh.) </em> Who’d get the free sandwich from the punch cards at Mo’s? <em> (Agatha.) </em> How should she adjust the timing of the shampoo-and-conditioner subscription now that it would run out half as fast? <em> (N/A. She’d forget to cancel.) </em>She forgot to cancel the next three deliveries in a row, then realized she might actually hate the smell of cherry blossoms. The pink bottles piled up under the sink, then in the laundry room, slotting in with the rest of the excess. </p><p>On the first Saturday morning in March, Agatha realized that aside from the shampoo, there was one more thing she’d forgotten to consider: the likelihood of running into her own family in the grocery store. She realized this, of course, because on the first Saturday morning in March, the likelihood was one hundred percent. She stood behind the self-serve grains, bag of uncooked rice in hand, sweating in her winter jacket. Josh stared from across the cereal aisle.</p><p>“Mama?” Nicky bounded into view.</p><p>She waggled her eyebrows. “Fancy seeing you here."</p><p>“Fancy?” He eyed her clothes, like he’d misunderstood the meaning of the word all this time.</p><p>“Different kind of fancy.”</p><p>“Oh. Me and Daddy are making pancakes! Are you coming, too?”</p><p>Her heart jolted. Josh rolled closer, and her eyes caught on a bag of frozen crab legs in his cart. He’d never liked crab—he’d always maintained that cracking open the shell hurt his teeth. She wondered why he was buying them, if that was just something he did now.</p><p>“I can’t, baby. I’m sorry.” </p><p>“Hey,” Josh tapped him. “Can you go get the chocolate chips?”</p><p>He ran out of the aisle without bothering to answer.</p><p>Josh opened his mouth, and she laughed, as mean as she could manage. “Oh, I would <em> really </em>rather not.”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” he said. “I’ve been calling—I should have said it earlier, and I didn’t. I’m sorry.”</p><p>Agatha picked a box of Honeycomb off the shelf and read the label. “I’m not going to pretend to get along with that—”</p><p>“I know, and I’m—”</p><p>“Let’s just agree that we’re never going to be able to do joint family vacations. Okay?”</p><p>She looked at him, and felt a horrifying lump in her throat. By far, the most irritating logistic of divorce was the prickly little bramble of hope, the way it tumbled around and snagged on the idea of <em> normalcy</em>. Until she said the words out loud, she hadn’t even known she’d entertained the idea—civil holidays, easy grocery store run-ins, maybe even the occasional joint pancake breakfast. She felt cold with the loss of these hopes, shivering and sweating like a stray in the cereal aisle.</p><p>“I broke up with her.” Josh eyed the cereal. “And Nicky doesn’t like Honeycomb anymore, by the way.”</p><p>Agatha stared at him, nails digging into the cardboard. “Am I supposed to congratulate you? Maybe fall on my knees in gratitude? And fuck you; maybe <em> I </em>like Honeycomb.”</p><p>“I just wanted you to hear it from me.”</p><p>She studied Josh’s face, searched for the mask of passive indifference, and found only exhaustion. </p><p>“I know you don’t like Honeycomb,” he said. </p><p>“And you don’t eat crab legs.” </p><p>Agatha threw the cereal box into her cart, too hard.</p><p>“Mama, Daddy, look—I got <em> fancy </em>toppings.” Nicky wandered proudly into the aisle with four bags of chocolate chips and a jar of something red.</p><p>Agatha kissed him swiftly goodbye, and left Josh to deal with the excess.</p><p>

<b>II. SUNDAY</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood in her empty kitchen, chewed her lip, and tried to think of anything but Rio. It felt like a bruise, the memory still fresh and tender in technicolor blue. She couldn't help but press on it a little, to see exactly how it hurt. When she dug her fingers in, she felt Rio’s arms around her waist, lips brushing hers. The slow, demanding rock of her body, the quiet shudder of her shoulders, like even with her own hand buried inside Agatha, <em> Agatha </em> was the one who’d taken <em> her </em> by surprise.</p><p>Somewhere before the end of the memory, she realized her phone was pressed to her ear. Rio picked up on the first ring. <em>Nobody </em>picked up on the first ring.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said.</p><p>Just <em> Hey, </em>And Agatha’s stomach lurched. She was full to the brim, suddenly, with <em> nerves. </em> The realization was so shocking, she considered hanging up—Agatha Harkness did not get <em> nervous</em>.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>“Sorry, I’m here.” Agatha shifted in her seat. “Hey.”</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said again. She didn’t ask why Agatha called.</p><p>“We need to talk.” Agatha winced. “Um, not about— I mean, about—”</p><p>“Yeah, we do.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed a handful of dry Honeycomb with some effort. She really did hate it. It was too sweet, and went soft too fast under the milk, collapsing into a sort of gruel. She rubbed her tongue against the roof of her mouth to rid the grit, and wondered how long they would stay on the line despite already having run out of things to say.</p><p>“So,” Rio said. She stretched the single word. “Um, how are you?”</p><p>Agatha paused with a plate in hand. She almost laughed. It was such a normal question, and so undeniably <em>strange</em>.</p><p>“I’m making a turkey club. Trying to figure out how Mo gets it so good.”</p><p>Rio hummed. “It’s the bread. Freshly baked.”</p><p>“Okay, well, fuck me, then.”</p><p>“You’re a regular Martha Stewart,” Rio laughed. “Let’s not forget what happened last time I ate something you made.”</p><p>“That doesn’t count—you had an undisclosed pre-existing condition. I, on the other hand, never get sick.” </p><p>“That’s not possible.”</p><p>Agatha was still smiling as she reached for the lettuce. She was smiling as she opened the bag. Staring up at her from between the leaves was a tiny, green frog. She stopped smiling.</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>, Jesus.”</p><p>She flung the bag across the room. The heads of lettuce spun through the air, her phone clattering onto some unknown surface. The frog was no bigger than her thumb, black eyes and bright green skin. She tossed a spoon at it, which did not work.</p><p>“Get out of my house, you little fucker.” </p><p>That didn’t work, either.</p><p>She lost track of how long she’d been stalking around the living room, caught in a standoff with a frog, when her front door opened behind her. She turned, tupperware in one hand and mustard in the other, and realized too late she’d squeezed the bottle. The tupperware followed half a second later, hitting Rio in the face.</p><p>“What—ow.” Rio rubbed her nose. She was standing in Agatha’s doorway, shirt covered in mustard.</p><p>“What the fuck are you doing?” Agatha shouted.</p><p>“What am <em> I </em> doing? What are <em> you </em> doing?” Rio stared at her. “You screamed ‘Fuck Jesus’ and ‘Get out of my house,’ and then your phone went dead—I thought you were getting murdered!”</p><p>Before Agatha could respond, she felt a soft thump against her chest. The frog perched comfortably on her lapel.</p><p>“Woah,” Rio said. “Cool.”</p><p>“Get it off me.” </p><p>“<em>This </em> is what you were yelling at? It’s just a tree frog.”</p><p>“I don’t care if it’s a fucking endangered species, Rio. If you don’t get it off of me, I’m shoving it in the garbage disposal.”</p><p>“Okay, okay. Stop moving.”</p><p>Agatha watched Rio cradle the frog and go about making him comfortable. She huffed and rolled her eyes, and somehow managed to keep her mouth shut until Rio sprinkled in water from the sink. </p><p>“He doesn’t need a five star spa experience. Just toss him outside.”</p><p>“You can’t release an American Green Tree Frog in Massachusetts,” Rio said, as if it were obvious.</p><p>“Why the fuck not?”</p><p>“They’re not native. He’ll die, or infect the local ecosystem. Or worse—overpopulate. You could disrupt the whole natural order of things.”</p><p>“Wouldn’t we need <em> two </em> frogs for that?” Agatha grumbled, and Rio squinted at her.</p><p>“You keep a bird skeleton in your desk drawer, and you’re afraid of frogs?”</p><p>“Stop going through my desk.” Agatha pointed an accusatory finger. “That was a gift. From an old student.”</p><p>“Right.” Rio said it almost affectionately, like Agatha was missing some kind of point. Agatha didn’t care for it. She turned to survey the mess.</p><p>“Nice place, by the way,” Rio offered, straight-faced.</p><p>“It’s better without all the—” Agatha gestured to the lettuce on the ground, then paused, turning to look at her. “How did you know where I live?”</p><p>Rio drummed her fingers on the counter, and then she blushed. <em>That</em> was interesting.</p><p>“Should I be worried?” Agatha tapped her chin and circled Rio slowly. “Let’s see—you can ID animal skeletons on sight. You like to hang out in dark places. I saw you laugh at Sharon last week when she walked into a pillar. Lack of empathy. They always say there are signs.”</p><p>“You’re the one who needs intervention,” Rio said, emphatic. “You bring your mail to school.”</p><p>“I grab it from the mailbox on my way out.”</p><p>“Well you also dump it all over your desk. The desk that I'm forced to share. Then <em> I </em> have to organize it before some kid puts stickers all over your 401K summary.”</p><p>Agatha wandered closer, the smirk finally spreading across her face.</p><p>“Rio, did you memorize my address?”</p><p>“I didn’t <em> memorize </em> it. You just get way too much mail. Sign up for paperless billing, Agatha, I’m begging you.” Rio was rambling now, her cheeks still flushed. “And our little klepto Oliver has been eyeing Nicky’s <em> Highlights </em> magazines, which I <em> know </em>are actually for you. I’ve seen you doing the puzzles.”</p><p>“I like the ‘spot the difference’ ones,” Agatha said absently.</p><p>She felt a curious sort of warmth in her gut, like an unexpected hug from Nicky in the grocery store, or the first glimpse of her name on a piece of mail. It hit her, then, on the heels of Rio’s ridiculous rant: Rio was standing in her kitchen for the first time. She thought of the last time they had been standing across from each other, and her mouth felt suddenly dry. She reached for the dish towel to distract herself, running it under the tap. She wrung it out, and paused—she’d meant to hand it over, but she found herself stepping closer instead, until she was dabbing at the yellow spot on Rio’s chest. </p><p>“You know, if you wanted to see me,” Rio lilted, “you didn’t have to lure me to your house and dump mustard all over me.”</p><p>“I was fresh out of garlic fries.”</p><p>She laughed, and Agatha scrubbed harder.</p><p>“Sorry I didn’t call,” Rio said softly, and placed her hand on top of Agatha's. “I was thinking about… everything.”</p><p>Agatha moved her hands under Rio’s, trying to resume the familiar, satisfying motion of scraping something clean.</p><p>“Agatha, can you just—just stop for a second.” </p><p>Agatha struggled under grip, and finally, Rio stripped off her shirt entirely. She dropped it on the floor.</p><p>“There,” she said. “Problem solved.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her torso, bare under the edge of a sports bra. The tree tattoo wrapped around her ribcage. She remembered, suddenly, seeing it for the first time under the pink light of the back room, wishing she could trace the lines.</p><p>“Miracle tree,” she muttered. </p><p>Rio looked at her in surprise. “How did you know that?”</p><p>“Fuck you. Maybe I’m worldly.”</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes. “Lilia.”</p><p>She eyed Agatha, and then wandered into the living room, hands clasped behind her back. It reminded Agatha of the first day of school, how Rio had wandered around her classroom, inspecting the decorations. She’d definitely been wearing a shirt then.</p><p><em> Spot the difference, </em>Agatha thought.</p><p>“When I first moved in with Lilia, I wasn't exactly good company.” </p><p>Rio said it offhand, picking at objects on the shelf by the TV, but Agatha stilled behind the counter. </p><p>“They always taught us in church that everything happens for a reason. Part of the Plan, and all that. So for a while, I was just angry. My Plan seemed pretty shitty.”</p><p>Rio brushed her fingers along the bookshelf, tipping out the spines and slotting them back.</p><p>“I really put Lilia through it. One time I set fire to her shawl in the bathtub.”</p><p>Agatha let out a startled laugh. “What did she do?”</p><p>“She just opened a window to let the smoke out.”</p><p>Agatha snorted, and her eyes fell on the frog in the tupperware. He was looking at her. She shuddered, and turned the container to face the wall.</p><p>“She made two cups of Moringa tea every morning, and every morning for two years, I’d toss mine out the window.”</p><p>“I would too,” Agatha said. “That tea is repulsive.”</p><p>Rio grinned, and then her face softened. She looked at Agatha. “That’s something family does, you know? Makes you tea in the morning. And I didn’t want Lilia to feel like family.”</p><p>“Why not?” Agatha asked. “I don’t exactly… <em> get </em> her, but you two seem to have some strange understanding.”</p><p>“Well,” Rio said. Her mouth was an odd twist of a smile. “The last time I’d had a family, it didn’t go great.”</p><p>“But Lilia wouldn’t…” Agatha paused. “She would never do that.”</p><p>“No,” Rio said. “But that’s the thing—when it happens once, it’s on the table forever. You’ll always know there’s the possibility, no matter how unlikely.”</p><p>Agatha thought of chasing her mother down a crowded walkway, and swallowed.</p><p>“But then I fucked up my knee," Rio continued. “My first night home, I felt like I was in someone else’s body. Like someone took all the important parts of me and ran them through a shredder. I wasn’t <em>me</em>, you know?”</p><p>Rio looked at Agatha again, her face serious, and Agatha couldn’t do anything but nod. If she did something else, it would be something insane, like walking across her house to wrap Rio tightly in her arms in the middle of this story. She didn’t know why Rio was even telling her this, in a voice that was so matter-of-fact, the way she explained the moral of a picture book to a second-grader. </p><p>Agatha reached for the bread on the counter. It was no doubt contaminated by frog feet and in need of disposal. She stacked the slices uselessly on the plate, one on top of the other. </p><p>“That night, Lilia told me that churches are institutions, and institutions are in the business of opportunistic bullshit. She said: ‘Darling, anyone with real clairvoyance knows that sometimes, things just happen.’”</p><p>“Shockingly lucid observation,” Agatha muttered, but for the first time, felt a sudden wave of affection for Lilia.</p><p>Rio crossed back to the kitchen island and picked up the tupperware, turning it in her hands. She examined the frog’s sticky feet.</p><p>“She said that making a life out of devastation was like making tea from the dead leaves of a tree.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t speak for a long moment. Then, she touched Rio’s hand. Her fingers landed on the space between her forefinger and thumb, stretched against the plastic. Rio put down the frog, and grabbed hold of Agatha’s fingers.</p><p>“Is there a point to this story?” Agatha cleared her throat.</p><p>Rio smiled, and rounded the kitchen island without letting go.</p><p>“It wasn’t some sort of divine intervention that you walked into the club that night, or that I ended up in your classroom. It just kind of <em> happened</em>. So maybe I’m supposed to be focusing on what comes next.” </p><p>She paused in front of Agatha, and for the first time, her gaze faltered. </p><p>“What does this have to do with tea?” Agatha's voice came out too weak. She was overcome with the immediate, overwhelming urge to turn and run to her room. She wanted to climb under the covers, the way she used to wait out a thunderstorm, or the sound of her mother yelling at someone in the living room.</p><p>“I drank the tea that next morning.” Rio said simply. “And now I can’t go one day without it.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “You’re saying you believe in miracles.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and stepped closer.</p><p>“I’m saying I’m glad I chose to start drinking it, instead of waiting around for things to get better.”</p><p>She paused. She still hadn’t let go of Agatha’s hand. </p><p>“And I’m saying, once I get fired, I think I know what I’d choose to do next.”</p><p>“What,” Agatha said dumbly, and why was she asking, why the fuck was she asking? Because Rio <em> wasn’t </em>getting fired, and Agatha needed to tell her that. She definitely didn’t need to hear whatever it was Rio was doing a very poor job explaining. But not that poor, because Agatha knew the exact, terrible, insane thing she was trying to say.</p><p>“Tell me, Agatha. Have you thought about it?” </p><p>Rio brushed a piece of hair behind Agatha’s ear, and Agatha’s felt her eyes flutter shut.</p><p>“Thought about what?”</p><p>Rio hummed. “Try again.”</p><p>Agatha hummed in response. She meant it to be a little cheeky, but it came out entirely too breathy to pass. </p><p>“Maybe once or twice.” </p><p>Rio set her lips to Agatha’s jaw, just under her ear. “Good. You’re getting closer,” she whispered, and Agatha’s breath hitched.</p><p>“Yes,” she breathed finally. </p><p>The single word felt more damning than begging Rio to touch her in a storage closet—the admission that she’d been thinking of all the ways in which they’d happened to each other. She opened her eyes, suddenly unsure what she would find. Rio was smirking.</p><p>“And what <em> exactly </em>have you been thinking about?” she said, thumb flexing at Agatha’s hip. “The roller coasters?”</p><p>Agatha kissed her then, if only to wipe the stupid smirk off her face. Because—and it was utterly maddening—Rio was right. For six days straight, Agatha had thought of nothing else but this. She wrapped an arm around Rio, fingers bumping over the bare ridges of her spine, and felt her knees weaken at the bend. There was a hesitance to the way Rio was kissing her, moving only her lips. It was almost sweet, the slightest tilt of her head, fingertips resting on Agatha’s face like this was some kind of quiet Sunday Miracle. But her kitchen was no place for miracles. She didn’t want it to be sweet, or hesitant, or any of the things that came after a thing that <em> happened</em>. So she dug her nails in, pushed Rio against the counter, and swallowed her gasp.</p><p>She hummed too needily, pressed too hard, as Rio’s tongue slid against hers. She licked at the inside of Rio’s mouth, the back of her teeth, the spongy space under her tongue. It was soft and wet like milk-mush cereal, like biting down on a crab leg and hollowing her cheeks to suck out the meat. Rio made a noise like a half-whimper against her mouth, and the sound made Agatha soften for a second against her. It made her want to slow, and cradle her. She wanted to stroke her fingers through Rio's dark hair and kiss the places she hadn’t yet, starting with the top of her forehead and tip of her nose, and ending at the soft skin behind her knee. And certainly not skipping any of the more notable middle parts. </p><p>She thought about the promise of her mouth on those middle parts. Then, for some reason, she remembered that Rio had memorized her address. It was an odd combination of thoughts, and her mouth felt strange, until she realized she was smiling. She bit down, and Rio made a noise of surprise, because it was her lip Agatha was really biting.</p><p>Agatha knew she would need to say something sooner or later. She wanted, desperately, for it to be later, and not sooner. So she shoved her hands higher, under the band of Rio’s bra, and dug into the meat of her back.</p><p>“Just so you know—” Rio mumbled, and then she gasped as Agatha moved a hand to the front. Agatha meant to palm her roughly, to catch her nails on the curve of her breast, but her hand stilled there instead. She bit back a moan at the impossible softness of Rio’s skin, at the feel of the single breast in her hand. She tested the weight of it, the give, her lips on autopilot as she mapped the shape so different than her own. Vaguely, she thought it might be a little strange, that she was just letting it rest on top of her palm, like the bag of uncooked rice from the bulk bin. But Rio didn’t seem to mind. She pushed her chest further into Agatha’s hand, and Agatha had to stop kissing her altogether at the sensation, the rub of fine hairs and goosebumps under her finger pads, the pebbled peak tightening under her thumb. </p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>, Agatha,” Rio was already panting against her mouth. “This really isn’t why I came over.” </p><p>“I don’t care.” Agatha knew it sounded mean, and she <em>didn’t</em> care, she didn't. She slotted a leg between Rio’s, but just on the off chance that it had been <em> too </em>mean—which she didn’t care about—she said: “I don’t see you trying to stop me.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes were shut, her hips rocking slow into Agatha’s thigh, and Agatha paused. Her hand lay motionless against Rio’s chest. “You’re not, right? Stopping me?” </p><p>Rio made a strangled noise and shook her head vehemently, clutching Agatha’s arms. It was childlike—just plain silly—the way she shook her head. Agatha felt a sudden jolt of affection, and kissed her hard to banish it. She nipped and pulled and sucked, biting and bruising, until she tasted copper.</p><p>“Fuck, sorry,” Agatha mumbled, swiping a thumb against the bleeding spot.</p><p>“It’s fine, I’m fine, it’s—” Rio didn’t bother to finish the sentence, pulling Agatha’s mouth back to hers. Agatha obliged, licking the sore spot with the tip of her tongue, and laid a hand over the Miracle Tree. She dragged her nails as she finally, <em> finally</em>, traced the lines. Rio twitched and moaned, her hips rutting harder, and the reality of it was staggering, all of a sudden—Rio, who turned people on for money, was coming apart against her, again.</p><p>Agatha broke her lips away to breathe, because apparently that was still needed despite the urgency of the situation. Rio’s breath smelled like those ridiculous white tic-tacs she carried around like a rattling pill box. It struck Agatha—she knew the difference between the smell of toothpaste and tic-tacs on Rio’s breath. </p><p><em>Catastrophe</em>, she thought. She finally looked at Rio's face, at her bright eyes and flushed cheeks and swollen lip. She looked like someone who’d been thoroughly kissed. She looked so goddamn <em> pretty</em>. This was certainly not one of the <em> Serious Things To Be Considered. </em></p><p>“Rio.” Agatha's voice was firm, albeit a little breathless, but she didn’t remove the hands from the soft line of Rio’s jaw. </p><p>“Sorry,” Rio said finally. “I know, we have a lot to figure out, I just—” her cheeks turned pink again. “I just really wanted to do that.”</p><p>“No, it’s not that; I—” Agatha stumbled backwards, out of Rio’s grasp. Her back caught the edge of the oven door handle, and she pressed her fingers shakily into the sore spot. She still didn’t know what made people want to do that—dig hard into a hurting spot. She dug hard, too, until she only felt a hot, dull ache. Her eyes fell to the container on the counter, and the frog stared back at her, small and unmoving. She wondered if frogs sat up straight when they died. </p><p>She didn’t look at Rio when she said it. She pressed her fingers into the bruise, looked at the frog, and said: “Wanda agreed not to fire you.”</p><p>In the silence that followed, Agatha kept her eyes on the red plastic lid. She flicked it, and the frog startled. Alive, after all.</p><p>“What do you mean, ‘<em>agreed</em>?’” Rio said finally.</p><p>Agatha steeled herself. </p><p>“I mean that you have until Friday to quit the club. Your teaching job and your California offer will still be good.”</p><p>She heard a burst of air, like Rio was scoffing at her. She didn’t like being scoffed at. She sulked and tapped the lid with all of her fingernails. </p><p>“Look at me.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look up right away. She looked at the water jug, then the browning bananas by the fridge, and then finally at Rio, like it had been her own idea all along. Rio’s face had gone pale, and Agatha knew now that the sound hadn’t been a scoff. It had been the release of all the air out of her lungs, like Agatha had kicked her clean in the stomach. </p><p>“You want to rephrase that as a question?” Rio said.</p><p>“No, Rio, I do not,” she replied automatically. Calling Rio just to talk, and kissing her in the middle of her kitchen—that was uncharted territory. This part, she knew. </p><p>“It’s not a question,” she continued, louder now. “A kindergartner could make this decision with their fucking eyes closed. You quit the club—the job that is literally killing you, by the way, according to your doctor—and keep doing the job you told me you loved. Where’s the huge, complicated dilemma here?”</p><p>“My doctor?” Rio’s eyes blazed. “You talked to my <em> doctor</em>?”</p><p>“I didn’t go out of my way. Carol seemed obliged to elaborate on the risk factors of asthma, and I just happened to be there, because you were walking around with no inhaler, no epipen, and a fucking death wish, apparently! And don’t think I don’t know you’ve been upping your refills. Turns out—working in a smoky club is bad for one’s lungs. Who knew!”</p><p>Rio snatched her shirt and her keys off the counter, her teeth bared in a way Agatha had never seen. </p><p>“You are <em> fucking </em>unbelievable, Agatha, you know that?”</p><p>“<em>You’re </em> unbelievable,” Agatha yelled, following her to the door. “If it were up to you, you would have just gone home and never shown up to school again. That’s what you were telling me just now, wasn’t it? That you’re ready to just roll over on a career before you’ve even gotten your goddamn degree. <em> That’s </em>unbelievable, Rio.”</p><p>Rio turned slowly to face her. </p><p>“You didn’t even think to <em> ask </em>me, did you?”</p><p>Agatha scoffed in response, ignoring the ugly twist in her chest.</p><p>“Fuck you, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha stopped short at the sudden frailty in Rio’s voice and looked at her standing on the porch. Rio opened her mouth like she might say something, and her lower lip trembled. Agatha had five excruciating seconds to memorize the flaring nostrils and white-knuckled grip on the t-shirt before Rio turned.</p><p>Agatha slammed the door behind her, not bothering to watch her leave. At least, not until she made it all the way down the path, and into her car, and down the block. Agatha could see that much from the window, and she wasn’t going to do something ridiculous, like cover her eyes in her own house, or turn the other way.</p><p>Once her street was empty, she turned sharply and slipped a little on the forgotten mustard. The frog paced in the plastic container, suddenly restless. She wondered if he knew the only person alive who cared about his well-being had just left. She sank to the hardwood, back against the door, and tucked her head between her knees. The tang of mustard burned her nose and made her dizzy. She decided it was altogether much worse than a roller coaster.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b>III. MONDAY</b>
</p><p> </p><p>“There was a <em> frog </em>in one of your lettuce bags.”</p><p>Agatha savored the next sip of her coffee as a reward for her superior patience. She’d waited on hold for three minutes and forty seconds.</p><p>“Oh, okay, yeah—it’s actually really common.” </p><p>Agatha couldn’t tell if the customer service representative was stoned or just spoke that way to irritate her. Either way, it didn’t bode well for her chances of a solution.</p><p>“The produce is distributed from Florida, and sometimes the little guys make it all the way onto the trucks.”</p><p>“Maybe I wasn’t clear.” Agatha set down her coffee, and held the phone to her mouth. “I don’t care how <em> common </em> it is. There is a <em> frog </em>in my kitchen. What’s stopping me from suing you for emotional and physical damages?”</p><p>“Actually, tree frogs aren’t a food safety hazard, which is why they end up in the produce so often. You can just throw the frog away and wash the lettuce.”</p><p>“I’m not—” Agatha looked at the frog, still unmoving except for its bobbing throat. “Throwing away a live frog seems… messy.”</p><p>“It’s <em> alive</em>? Shit, usually they’re dead. Maybe get it a tank or something? My girlfriend has a pet turtle, if you want me ask what—”</p><p>Agatha hung up and tossed the phone in defeat. The frog stared through the plastic.</p><p>“Lucky bastard,” she muttered, and carried him to the car.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b>IV. TUESDAY</b>
</p><p> </p><p>By recess, Agatha realized she’d been counting the hours since Rio had looked her in the eye. Almost forty-eight since she’d stood there and stared, as if Agatha had yanked out her guts and strung them over the porch railing for good measure. Agatha considered Rio’s behavior a blatant overreaction. Then she stopped <em> considering</em>, because she didn’t want to stumble across anything inconvenient. </p><p>She paced by the slide, and kicked idly at the cracks in the crumb rubber. For once, she didn’t want to be out here. She wanted to be at her picnic table, which had become Rio’s picnic table. She didn’t know exactly it had happened, but she realized one day that it was always where she went looking first, under the maple tree. </p><p>Agatha found, to her surprise, she didn’t mind giving up her spot. Rio looked <em> good </em>there—dark hair falling over her face, legs stretched across the opposite bench. Agatha had spent six months trying to understand this simple logic, and the last seven days wondering if she might try explaining it to Rio. But when she imagined saying it out loud—<em>I’ve gotten used to you</em>—it sounded like comparing her to an old shoe. And then came the terrifying thought: maybe she’d never grow tired of Rio at all. Maybe she’d just grow more used to her, year after year, until she was old and unstable and couldn’t remember the picnic table had ever been hers in the first place. She shook the thought away, and the resulting crawl up her spine, as Grace and Kara sidled up to her.</p><p>“Ms. Harkness?” they said together, and Agatha raised her eyebrows. The unison always set her teeth on edge. She tried not to think of the twins from <em>The Shining</em>.</p><p>“Ye-es?” She matched their tone.</p><p>“Do frogs like to eat grass? We can get some for him.” Grace looked up at her earnestly, and Agatha wanted to groan. For some reason, she was still unable to make good on her threat of shoving it down the garbage disposal. Even more disturbing, she also couldn’t look at the back door without thinking of how upset Rio would be if she—how had she put it? <em> Disrupted the natural order of things.  </em></p><p>She’d taken a spare tank from Peggy’s classroom in the name of education, leftover from a prior class pet situation. (If any kids asked, she was supposed to say that Knuckles the Lizard died of old age) (Knuckles hadn’t died of old age, though; he’d died from eating crayons) (at the scene of the crime, the victim’s tail was blue and red, and the frozen crickets meant to be his dinner had thawed, inching across the classroom floor). Agatha had left Peggy’s with a sincere hope that the crayon curse came with the tank.</p><p>“I think he eats lettuce,” Agatha said to Grace. And then, because she knew she should, added: “We can check the library and see if there are any books about frogs.”</p><p>“What’s his name?” Kara asked, swinging from foot to foot. “And where’d you get him?”</p><p>“I was making a frog sandwich,” Agatha muttered.</p><p>Kara looked uncertain, like she wasn't quite sure if it had been a joke, and Grace looked up. </p><p>“His name is <em> Sandwich</em>?”</p><p>Agatha watched them spread the news across the playground and knew that she would never, as long as she lived, call a frog by name. She smiled all the same.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>When they came in from recess, Rio’s arm was dangling into the tank. She held what looked like deformed worms, and Nicky was crowded next to her, watching with wide eyes.</p><p>“Sandwich eats worms?” Grace asked.</p><p>Rio hummed, completely unfazed by the new name. “And other insects.”</p><p>“Ms. Harkness said he eats lettuce.”</p><p><em> Fucking narcs. </em>Agatha tried not to glare at a seven year-old, and Rio turned her head ever so slightly. She didn’t look at Agatha, not all the way. Forty-eight hours and counting.</p><p>“Ms. Harkness was wrong,” Rio said. “Tree frogs are carnivores. Do you know what that means?”</p><p>“I know!” Nicky waved excitedly. “They only eat other animals.”</p><p>Rio smiled at him, and handed him a worm. Agatha was proud despite herself as Nicky placed it gently into the tank.</p><p>“Thank you all for your help,” Rio said. “Sandwich is very lucky. Let’s get ready for art, and we can learn more about him tomorrow.”</p><p>“Go wash your hands if you touched the frog,” Agatha added, eyeing their wandering fingers.</p><p>Nicky opened his mouth, and Agatha shot him a look.</p><p>“Or if you touched a <em> worm.</em>”</p><p>He shut his mouth and strolled casually out the door.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha muttered in Rio’s direction. </p><p>“Touched the worms,” Rio called over her shoulder, and held up her hands. She didn’t look at Agatha.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Peter Parker was not an art teacher. He was sixteen, volunteering as some sort of detention, which Agatha could not for the life of her figure out how he’d gotten. She was familiar with delinquency in all forms, and he seemed at most a harmless science whiz. Which, at the moment, was not coming in handy for his internship teaching art to second-graders. Agatha watched him draw a shaky outline of a dog mixed with an alligator, which he was describing as a dinosaur. </p><p>“I’m supposed to sign off on his hours for <em> that</em>?” Agatha mumbled to Rio. Rio didn’t answer. She sat in a kid’s desk, pen tapping her thigh. </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whispered again, unable to keep the desperation out of her tone. The tapping sound stopped, and Agatha held her breath.</p><p>Finally, Rio stood, her movements jerky and rigid, and gestured to the back door.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Rio left the door propped open at Peter’s look of utter alarm, and Agatha followed her to the maple tree. She wondered when the buds of green would arrive—if, by then, the tree and the picnic table would still belong to Rio, or if Rio would be gone. Agatha found she’d rather never come out here again, if those were the terms and conditions. Rio shuffled her feet, nose already red from the chill, and looked at the trunk of the tree.</p><p>“Are you just not going to look at me for the rest of the—” Agatha stopped herself. <em> Week? Year?  </em></p><p>Rio traced the damp tree bark with her index finger. It slotted into a smooth groove, and Agatha knew from the easy way her fingers fit that she’d traced this section of the tree before. Agatha felt, for the first time, jealous of a maple tree. Then, she felt the hair raise on the back of her neck. She wondered if she were a wild dog, if her hackles would be up. She thought probably they would be, most of the time.</p><p>“There’s something I don’t understand,” she said, biting down on the words. “You’re so angry at me, but you’re here. Go ahead, tell me you quit.”</p><p>Rio was silent.</p><p>“No one is forcing you to stay.” Agatha took a step closer. She could see the bags under Rio’s eyes, the red rims of her eyelids that she’d missed until now. If she were smarter, or nicer, or a different third thing she didn’t know because she’d been raised by Evanora—she’d see those things and decide to stop. She took another step.</p><p>“No one forced you to teach Ellie how to double dutch, or engage in some weird philosophical discussion with Oliver about what happens after you die, and take it so goddamn serious, even though he was talking about blood-eating lizards, or whatever.”</p><p>She stepped even closer, until she was standing too close to be acceptable, right outside the back windows of the classroom. </p><p>“No one forced you to shove your arm into a box of worms for a <em> stray frog</em>, and yet. Here you are, Rio.”</p><p>It had started as a prosecution, but she felt the utter betrayal of softness creeping into her tone. <em>Here you are. </em>She balled her fists, and reminded herself that Rio had already tried to leave once before. Rio was a Leaver. Things only got worse, the longer a Leaver stayed.</p><p>Rio’s eyes were trained on the picnic table. Agatha couldn’t help herself. She reached for Rio’s face in broad daylight—<em>reckless, stupid</em>—and curled her fingers around her jaw. Rio’s eyes snapped to hers in surprise and then heat, and Agatha drank in the color with a shocking kind of thirst. She was relieved there wouldn’t be a forty-ninth hour.</p><p>“Let go.” </p><p>Rio’s voice rasped. Agatha couldn’t look away now, after being denied for so long, so she caught it—the pleading in her eyes where she’d expected fury.</p><p><em> Leaver</em>, Agatha thought. <em> Leaver, Leaver, Leaver</em>.</p><p>“If you want to choose the club over this classroom,” Agatha said, tightening her grip, “do it now. Don’t waste your time. Believe it or not, I managed on my own for nineteen years before you got here.”</p><p>Rio grabbed the fingers digging into her jaw. For a short, awful moment, Agatha couldn’t tell if Rio was trying to hurt her back, or trying to keep her there. Rio hesitated, like she wasn’t sure either. Then she stepped back, and She left Agatha standing under the maple tree.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">
<strong>V. WEDNESDAY</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not going.” Agatha shrugged. “Makes no fucking sense.”</p><p>“I agree.” Rio fiddled with Wanda’s windowsill herbs, tilting the stalks this way and that. </p><p>The three of them twitched in tandem at the faint beep of the school bus, six eyes finding the clock.</p><p>“Scott is expecting two teachers on the bus.” Wanda sounded tired. “You’ve got ten minutes—<em>someone </em> explain.”</p><p>“<em>You </em> asked me to cover you!” Agatha looked at her, incredulous. “Why can’t you just go on the damn field trip; they’re <em> your </em>kids!”</p><p>“I have a lunch meeting with Hank.” </p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Hank Pym? You’d rather have lunch with the tightest asshole in the fifth grade than chaperone a field trip?”</p><p>“Agatha.” </p><p>“He doesn’t believe in teachers' unions. How do you teach U.S. history and not believe in unions?”</p><p>“It was a standing meeting,” Wanda said. “How did <em> you two </em> not talk about this?”</p><p>“I’d already signed up,” Rio said, exasperated, "which she would know if she ever checked her email.” </p><p>“You <em> emailed </em> me?” Agatha squinted at Rio in disbelief. For some unassailable reason, she had the whole planter in her hands now. “We work eight inches apart all day, and you fucking <em> emailed </em>me that you were going on a field trip.”</p><p>“I do have a job to do, I’m not just hanging around waiting for you to—”</p><p>“Stop it,” Wanda cut in. “Rio, who signed off?”</p><p>“Heyyy, guys,” Jen poked her head through the doorway, then slipped in entirely. “I couldn’t help but overhear this <em> very </em>normal-sounding conversation.” She looked at Wanda. “You told me to find her more fourth grade opportunities, and this seemed like an easy one.”</p><p>“Why does she need fourth grade—”</p><p>Agatha stopped herself short. The office was suddenly silent.  She stumbled to the details, two seconds too late: <em> California</em>.</p><p>“So you signed up for this…”</p><p>“Before the break, yes,” Rio snapped. “We’re all caught up now.”</p><p>“Oop.” Jen slunk backwards, hands raised in front of her. “Didn’t mean to get in the middle of this little lovers’ tiff.”</p><p>“It’s not a tiff,” Agatha snapped, just as Rio said, “We’re not lovers.”</p><p>Jen and Wanda exchanged looks, and then turned slowly to Agatha. Agatha felt her cheeks blaze.</p><p>“And, obviously,” she added, gesturing vaguely, “we’re not…”</p><p>“Oh my <em> god</em>,” Jen muttered, hand to her forehead. “Please stop talking.”</p><p>Agatha stared pointedly at the bulletin board. Someone had removed the red smiley face of thumbtacks since the fall, and they were scattered normally across the edges.</p><p>“J, just take my place.”</p><p>“You want <em> me </em> to spend the day at, quote, ‘New England’s most <em> historically accurate </em>colonial village?’ Hard pass.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, and scratched at her nose. “Okay,” she said finally. “That’s fair. I’ll go. Enjoy subbing second grade.”</p><p>Jen blinked. “Wait—what?”</p><p>Rio followed Agatha out, careful to stay a few paces behind.</p><p>“I rotated the plant,” she called over her shoulder. “The one on the end wasn’t getting enough light. And don’t forget to check on Sandwich.”</p><p>“<em>What</em>?”</p><p>“They have a frog together,” Agatha heard Wanda mumble. She wasn’t far enough down the hallway to miss their conspiratorial laughter. Fucking idiots.</p><p>“I didn’t know you were going,” she emphasized. Rio had already sped past her.</p><p>“I don’t care,” came her offhand reply.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Agatha dragged her hand along the wooden fences of Old Sturbridge Village. She usually led the front of the pack and played <em> snakebite</em>, tapping anyone that passed her and sending them sprinting to the back of the line. But these weren’t her kids, and she had the unexpected luxury of ambling with the slow-walkers.</p><p>The air was thick with an early warm front and recent rain, and the grass already grew lush between the cottages. It smelled good here, too, like freshly baked bread and hay, and something else. She inhaled deep, over and over, trying to identify the unfamiliar smells (she recognized candle wax by scent, and boiling wool-dye by sight), until she was light-headed. She only stopped when Billy squinted up at her and said loudly, “why are you breathing like that?”</p><p>For the most part, she kept her distance from Rio. By mid-morning, she’d remembered she loved doing this, and decided it was a good thing she’d come after all. It wasn’t until she was sweating in a barn, fighting Rio for slippery purchase on the handle of a butter churn, that she decided she’d been terribly wrong.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The East Barn towered over a meadow, and Agatha was impressed despite herself—she’d never seen a barn so tall. With the following wave of disgust, she wondered when this had become the kind of thing that impressed her—a green ground, and a big, red barn. She remembered a farmhouse at night—Nicky in bed with a rabbit and Rio curled on the carpet. Smoke rising above their heads under towering trees, the quiet hoot of an owl, and her hand over the soft ridges of Rio’s braid.</p><p>The feeling hit her with a kind of sweeping intensity, and she put a hand out on the nearest fence. She didn’t know what it was, or why it was happening, but she stood there and breathed in the smell of pine until it passed. She had a nagging thought that she might be turning into someone who liked peace and quiet, now that peace and quiet had a certain kind of shape.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“Does anyone know where butter comes from?”</p><p>The tour guide—who may have actually lived here, judging by his smell and his tunic—spoke too animatedly for this time of afternoon in a hot barn.</p><p>“Milk," came a chorus of replies.</p><p>“That’s exactly right. And where does milk come from?”</p><p>No one answered, and Agatha stifled a laugh. The gangly teen with dark, curly hair, had underestimated the power of a too-obvious answer. With the massive rust-colored cow standing next to him, the kids were instead looking at him like he was stupid.</p><p>“Raise your hand,” Agatha muttered to Billy, who hadn’t left her side at the back of the group. “You know the answer.”</p><p>“What if it’s not right?” he whispered.</p><p>“It’s right.”</p><p>“But what if it’s not?” He stared at the cow, as if there might be some kind of trick.</p><p>Agatha hummed. “Wouldn’t you rather find out than wonder forever?”</p><p>“No. I’ll just wonder forever.” </p><p>She swallowed her laugh again, and her eyes fell automatically to Rio across the heads of children. It was a habit—a kid said something particularly good, and they’d look for each other. It was a quick glance-and-hold to bookmark the story for later, where they could laugh and laugh, alone and unencumbered by Best Practice. Agatha didn’t want to go back to Best Practice. </p><p>The light from the open loft made a sun spot on the floor, and dappled part of Rio’s arm. Agatha wondered what the light did to her eyes. Suddenly, she wished they were alone in this barn. She wished she was close enough to smell the spice of Rio’s cologne and the intoxicating base of her plain, boring soap, to inhale slow and full against her neck. She would press her nose just there, she knew, at the spot underneath her ear. She wished Rio wouldn’t push her away if she did. She wished and wished, and breathed in hay and cow shit.</p><p>It was somewhere in that fantasy about Rio’s clean-smelling neck that she raised her arms behind her to stretch. And it was there, with her hands raised, that her day took its somewhat unexpected—but really, mostly expected—turn for the worse.</p><p>“We have a volunteer!”</p><p>The kids spun their heads to look at her, and she lowered her hands.</p><p>“Oh—no.” </p><p>“Come right up!” The boy looked at her with clear desperation, held out a bonnet, and Agatha sighed.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>She churned butter to the teen’s instruction of: <em> “It’s easy—just like you’re plunging a toilet.” </em> After fifteen minutes, the bucket’s contents were still mostly cream, and Agatha was starting to sweat under her bonnet. Apparently, <em> historically accurate </em> meant <em> incredibly inefficient. </em>She’d barely noticed that the kids had been dismissed to their own churning stations until the teen came back to relieve her.</p><p>“Thanks for that,” he said. </p><p>“Oh, anytime.” Agatha wondered if this pilgrim boy understood sarcasm. She tugged on the handle. </p><p>“Oh, sometimes it helps if you—”</p><p>“I got it.”</p><p>She put all her weight on it, wiggling from side to side. Still nothing.</p><p>“Can you believe they used to do this every day?” the teen said finally. “Make their own butter?” </p><p>“They didn’t. They had to skim enough cream first.” Agatha paused to catch her breath, and gestured to the door. “It’s on the sign.”</p><p>“Oh.” His face reddened. “Yeah. Of course.”</p><p>“Maybe you should listen to him.” Rio spoke casually, but there was a coolness underneath that made Agatha look up. “It’s his job—maybe he’s actually the expert on this very specific topic.”</p><p>“Clearly.”</p><p>“William,” Rio said, and Agatha stared. Since when did the teen have a name? </p><p>“Isn’t it true that the amount of cream would depend on the number of cows?”</p><p>“Well, yeah,” he said, rubbing his neck. “Some families had up to a hundred cows.”</p><p>“Wow, a <em> hundred</em>.” Rio tilted her head. “And isn’t it true that in summer they’d churn more frequently so it wouldn’t spoil?”</p><p>“That’s right,” William said, as if he’d just remembered. “They mostly had red cows, like Luci over there. They produced more milk.”</p><p>“So it’s entirely possible that some families had to churn every day, isn’t it?”</p><p>“Yes, definitely." William's eyes flitted between them.</p><p>Rio shot Agatha a look. “I can read signs, too.”</p><p><em> Mean </em>was rare on Rio. Agatha didn’t prefer it. </p><p>“This village doesn’t have a <em> hundred </em>cows, does it?” Agatha said finally. “I’m trying to keep a fourteen year-old from making a fool of himself in front of the children.”</p><p>“Um, I’m sixteen,” William said.</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Well, you should... eat more protein. Or drink a glass of that milk you love so much.”</p><p>“This isn’t about him,” Rio said. “God forbid you can’t control a situation for thirty seconds, Agatha. We’re in a <em> barn</em>. On a <em> kids’ </em>field trip.”</p><p>The hot stink of butter and manure was starting to make Agatha nauseous. Rio still being angry with her was unexpectedly adding to the effect.</p><p>“Sorry—” William stepped forward, gesturing weakly at the churn. “Can you not break that? I don’t want to get in trouble.”</p><p>“I’m not breaking it, Teen. I’m <em> fixing </em>it.”</p><p>“Jesus Christ.” Rio strode towards her, and grabbed hold of the handle, her hands slotting between Agatha’s. “Let go.”</p><p>“You let go.” Agatha felt the faithful prickle at the back of her neck, hackles spreading slow to the base of her spine. She tried to ignore the fact that hackles only made a wild dog look bigger—a fairly useless trick to use on Rio, who already seemed to know the exact size and shape of her.</p><p>They stood there, hands clasped over the butter churn, like they were just another historical exhibit. Agatha wondered what the sign would call them—colonial sisters, or wives, or probably sister-wives if she was really committed to being<em> historically accurate</em>. She corrected her earlier assumption—sister-wives were surely one point for efficiency. But inside this real barn, inside a pretend village, they weren’t on the same team at all, by blood, marriage, or otherwise. Agatha pulled with all of her strength, and she could see the hard line of Rio’s jaw that gave her away. </p><p>“It’s really okay,” William said, uncertain. “We’ll fix it later, you can—”</p><p>“Stop it,” Agatha hissed at Rio. She could feel the sweat on her brow.</p><p>“For the love of god, Agatha, LET GO!” </p><p>Rio’s hand slipped a little, and her thumb pressed into the soft of Agatha’s hand, the bit between her forefinger and thumb. Agatha dropped the handle before she even realized she had. The force snapped the churn free, and Rio, still gripping the handle, stumbled backward. A rain of milk semi-solids flew through the air, the churn overturned at their feet. </p><p>Rio stood in a puddle of cream, her hand braced against the cow’s flank. Luci the Red Cow mooed, and turned her head to see who’d undone her hard, lonely work.  </p><p>“Sorry,” Rio muttered.</p><p>Agatha was surprised it would be over so easily, then realized Rio had apologized to the cow.</p><p>“There’s a sink out back,” William said, defeated. </p><p>Agatha didn’t bother answering before she turned.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The “sink” was a small metal trough that hugged the outer wall. Agatha stood there with the tap running and no inclination to scrub herself clean with the frigid water. She gripped the edge of the steel and shut her eyes. She only opened them when she heard movement beside her. She watched Rio toe off her milk-soaked shoes and socks with jerky movements. When she couldn’t look anymore, she turned to the back field. </p><p>The yellow-green was laced with early white wildflowers, just starting to poke above the grass. Swallows swooped, dragonflies hovered, and gophers poked their heads out to watch. Agatha blinked against the <em> aliveness </em>of it, the intricate dance of movement and color and sound. On a different day, or even one hour ago, it would have been breathtaking in its beauty.</p><p>When she turned back, Rio was wringing out her socks in the sink. She finally looked up, socks balled in her fists, and the hard lines of her face made Agatha’s mouth run dry. She gestured to Rio’s bare feet.</p><p>“I didn’t mean to—”</p><p>“I’m done with this.” Rio spoke at the same time, and they both fell silent.</p><p>“You’re going to have to be a little more specific,” Agatha said after a beat, although she didn’t really want that at all. This was the other side of the bramble of hope, when the blackberries had been picked and sold before they could be eaten at all, leaving a thicket of thorns. Agatha felt them all scratch at once. </p><p>Rio’s hands tightened around her socks, and Agatha watched the water drip from her hands.</p><p>“<em>This</em>,” she said again, gesturing between them. A drop of water flicked onto Agatha’s cheek, and she tried not to flinch.</p><p>“It’s been six months, Agatha. We’ve spent every day together for <em> six </em>months, and all of it has been so fucking hard. This was supposed to be one semester, okay? And I just—” her voice broke. “I don’t want to do it anymore.”</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms, fingers digging deep into her own sides until her ribs ached.</p><p>“You’ve changed, since we met,” Rio said. “In a good way. I liked who you were becoming, I—” she stopped, and started again. “You want things. You feel things. For me, I think. Or, I thought.” She paused, her gaze faltering. “But you have no respect for me. You say I'm good at this, and then you treat me like I will <em> never </em> be good enough. That I’m always doing something wrong, that I can’t make the right decisions about my own <em> life</em>.” </p><p>“Rio—” Agatha’s voice trembled.</p><p>“I’m sure your other student teachers didn’t mind it,” Rio continued, her tone bitter now. “Your hand up their ass, controlling them like brainless little puppets. I get it, I do—when you’re in your element, the way you command a room, it’s fucking magnificent, it’s—” she swallowed, blinking like she’d gotten carried away. Her face hardened again.</p><p>“I never had this much fucking trouble before you,” Agatha said finally. The words hung between them, and Rio took a step closer.</p><p>“And why do you think that is?” </p><p>Agatha knew how to identify a leading question—it was the nature of her job. </p><p>
<em> Don’t you think it’s better to share?  </em>
</p><p>Or <em> Wouldn’t you rather know for sure that milk comes from a cow, instead of wondering forever? </em> </p><p>Or <em> Why is it, Agatha, that out of everyone, you treat me so differently, so much worse, so much better, and just so much?  </em></p><p>But as far as leading questions had gotten her up to this point, she’d never yet learned how to answer one.</p><p>She looked at Rio, and circled the differences in front of her: </p><p><em> Difference 1: </em> Someone who’d once been a stranger and now was not.</p><p><em> Difference 2: </em>Cheeks flushed with anger instead of the soft press of Agatha’s lips. </p><p><em> Difference 3: </em>Socks in her hands, not on on her feet. </p><p>She still looked pretty, though, even covered in spoilt milk. <em> Not a difference.  </em></p><p>“I never asked for a student teacher.” Agatha yanked off her soiled sweater, and hurled it into the sink. The tap was still running. She breathed through her nose, and squared her shoulders.</p><p>“<em>You </em> are the single biggest inconvenience of my entire fucking life.” </p><p>She said it in grief, not anger, though her teeth were bared. But what was grief, if not injustice? It was the first kind she’d ever known: being handed to the world already assigned to Evanora. And now, here it was again—the smoking gun, in her own clammy hands. It was the case she’d been making to herself since the day Rio had stepped into her classroom; the same needling thought that made her say, that first afternoon: “You don’t remember me?” </p><p>Six months later, and the final verdict was the same: Agatha Harkness was just one more woman that Rio had <em> happened </em>to.</p><p>She looked at the soft face she’d gotten used to. The hands and lips she’d felt in a pink room in June, and everything she’d suddenly, plainly known. And she understood now, standing in front of a barn with a bonnet at her feet, that she would never go back to not knowing. She thought that might have been the worst thing anyone had ever done to her. For that, she thought she might hate Rio more than she hated her own mother. So she looked at the face she might hate the most, and said: “I never even asked for that lap dance.”</p><p>She saw it break Rio’s exterior like a crack in the earth. Rio stepped forward, and poked a finger into Agatha’s chest so hard she stumbled a step.</p><p>“<em>You </em> kissed <em> me </em>in that closet, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha wrenched her hand away from her chest. She squeezed too hard. </p><p>“You kissed me first.”</p><p>Rio went completely still. And then, to Agatha’s utter, gut-wrenching dismay, her brown eyes welled. She took a step back.</p><p>“Yeah, well.” Her voice wavered. “You kissed me second.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t hear Rio’s bare footsteps in the dirt, and she didn’t turn. Some moments later, she knew she was alone. Her eyes blurred against the back field, her wet sweater cradled in her arms. She supposed it was always going to happen this way. Like the cherry blossom shampoo that ate through the plastic and oozed, until she stepped into the great big puddle on the laundry room floor. They had a way of doing that—the<em> Serious Things to Be Considered </em> that never did get considered. </p><p>She watched a swallow dive, beak snapping shut on an unsuspecting dragonfly. She felt stupid to have thought it was any sort of dance at all, instead of what it was—missed collisions and gnashing bone. It was over one in one crunch, and the swallow didn’t even land.</p><p>She didn’t know when exactly Rio had left, just that she had. She left Agatha shivering in the shadow of the very tall barn. She left the bonnet on the ground, and her socks in the sink.</p><p> </p><p align="center">
<b>VI. THURSDAY</b>
</p><p> </p><p>On the heels of the most eventful day of her week—but not even in the top five of this year—Agatha took her first sick day in half a decade. Maybe it’d been caused by some sort of emotional whiplash, the speed and force at which she’d gone from peace and quiet to no-so-peace-and-quiet. More likely, Billy’s sniffling hadn’t been a result of the chill in the air.</p><p>She'd woken up with her head heavy, nose stuffed, and eyes watering. She’d made it all the way to the front door, until she’d sat down on the bench to put on her shoes. She’d quickly given up on the idea of getting back up. </p><p>On the one hand, she’d been spared the torture of sharing a room with Rio. But on the other hand, she’d been denied the opportunity to share a room with Rio. Instead, she laid in bed with pieces of tissue stuffed up her nose, and finally relented to texting Wanda on the hour:</p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Agatha</em> </b> <em> : Hey. Did she decide yet? </em></p><p><b> <em>Wanda</em> </b> <em> : Still no.  </em></p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Agatha</em> </b> <em> : How about now? She usually takes her break now.  </em></p><p><b> <em>Wanda</em> </b> <em> : She’s eating a granola bar.  </em></p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Agatha</em> </b> <em> : It’s almost recess, did you hear anything? </em></p><p><b> <em>Wanda</em> </b> <em> : If you need soup, I can bring it to you. Otherwise, please shut up. </em></p><p> </p><p>“Selfish bitch,” Agatha muttered, and dropped her phone onto the nightstand. She stared at the ceiling for a minute, and then reached for it again. For the fourth time, she read her last text to Rio.</p><p> </p><p><b> <em>Agatha</em> </b> <em> : Lesson plan’s in your inbox. Taking a dick day. </em></p><p><b> <em>Agatha</em> </b> <em> : SICK day. </em></p><p> </p><p><b>Rio</b> : <em> of course you are. very classy move. </em></p><p><b> <em>Agatha</em> </b> <em> : Fuck you, I’m really sick.  </em></p><p>Then:</p><p><b> <em>Agatha</em> </b> <em> : I hope that frog chokes on a worm and dies in front of everyone. </em></p><p>And then, five minutes later:</p><p><b> <em>Agatha</em> </b> <em> : Tell Nicky. I don’t want him to worry. And tell him that Josh is picking him up.  </em></p><p> </p><p>She dropped her phone on her nightstand again, and rubbed her hands over her face. She decided that maybe she wasn't sick, after all. Maybe she would sleep it off, and go in after lunch. She pinched her eyebrows to check if they hurt—the usual quick-test that would tell her if her stuffed-up nose and aching head were, in fact, due to illness. It was the same way she checked the weather even as she saw the rain from her window, to be absolutely certain she'd need to inconvenience herself with umbrella.</p><p>She pinched both sides at once. They did hurt, but maybe that was just because she was pinching them. She was never sure, because it was the only time she ever pinched herself in the face. She yawned, and her fingers were still resting against her forehead as she drifted into a fitful sleep.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The next thing she registered was the doorbell pulling her from some strange fever dream—something with elements of colonial history and strip clubs and Disneyland mascots. She blinked awake, and groaned against the rush of blood to her head as she pulled herself out of bed.</p><p>She opened her door to Josh.</p><p>“The fuck are you doing here?” she grumbled.</p><p>“You asked me to come get Nicky’s stuff.”</p><p>“Oh.” Agatha blinked. “Shit, it’s almost three? Give me a second.”</p><p>Agatha brought out Nicky’s bag, stuffing his shoes and jacket inside, and heard Josh shifting next to her.</p><p>“Hey, I do still want to apologize,” he said. “Properly.”</p><p>Agatha groaned again, and didn’t care that she sounded like a petulant child. The sound vibrated through her sore cheekbones.</p><p>“Do we have to do this now? Here? Ever?” </p><p>“I would really like to,” he said.</p><p>“Fine.” Agatha turned on the tea kettle. “You have until the water’s boiling.”</p><p>“I shouldn’t have let McKenna say those things,” he said earnestly. “It was the worst thing I’ve ever done to you. I shouldn’t have brought her to Disney. I shouldn’t have even dated her, I mean Jesus.” He shook his head, and looked at the pictures of Nicky on the fridge. Agatha had taken down the ones with him in frame.</p><p>“I lost things, too,” he said. “You just handled it better than I did—you always do. And I’m sorry I couldn’t. I don’t want to be that kind of example for Nicky.”</p><p>“Where is this coming from?” Agatha said finally, unsure what else to say.</p><p>He smiled weakly. “Quit weed, started therapy. Trying to cook more. You know, all the stuff you’re supposed to do after…" He trailed off and gestured around them.</p><p>“Crab legs,” she muttered, and he had the wherewithal to blush.</p><p>“Crab legs,” he echoed. “Still don’t like ‘em.”</p><p>Agatha looked at him. She waited for the wave of annoyance and righteous indignation, but it didn’t come. </p><p>“I will never like Honeycomb,” she said finally. He smiled. </p><p>They stood there, looking at each other in the living room that used to be theirs. It felt strange—less like pressing hard on a bruise, and more like touching the ridge of an old scar, or slipping her fingers into a familiar groove of a tree trunk.</p><p>“As you’ve mentioned not a small amount of times,” he said after a beat, “I’m an insecure man who can’t help but offer his opinion on things that aren’t my business.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips. “And?”</p><p>“You know, for the first seven years we were together, you really put me through the ringer.”</p><p>“This again?”</p><p>“I got you a giant balloon on your birthday, and you popped it with your fingernails. I wrote you cards for every occasion, and you threw them away without reading them.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. With her transgressions listed out in this way, they felt remarkably more cruel than she’d remembered. She watched the steam trickle from the kettle, willing it to sound, and conceded she was not an exception to the rule of watched pots.</p><p>“Okay,” she said finally. “Maybe, <em> possibly</em>, that was a bit much.”</p><p>Josh hummed. “But you let Rio buy you cotton candy.”</p><p>Agatha turned to look at him in disbelief. </p><p>“There is no fucking way you’re about to say what I think you’re about to say.” </p><p>Josh held up his hands. “I could never get you to let down your guard in twenty years, and she did it in two fucking seconds! Someone has to say it, even if that someone is me, which is… ” He hesitated. “You don’t realize you’re doing it, do you?” </p><p>“Doing what?” she mumbled. </p><p>Josh laughed, rubbing his mouth. “This is so fucking weird. Look, when you’re around her, you’re just so <em> you</em>. Like… Agatha with a capital A.” </p><p>The kettle whistled, and she jumped. Her heart pounded. </p><p>“So, you woke up today and decided to wingman your ex-wife?” </p><p>“No, definitely not.” He exhaled, puffing out his cheeks. “It’s more like… remember when Nicky would tell you when your sunscreen wasn’t rubbed in, and you’d rub the wrong spot and say ‘where?’ And he’d laugh so hard, until you did it one too many times?” </p><p>“Oh, god, that’s right.” Agatha smiled a little. “He was so annoyed, he did that scrunchy-mad thing with his face.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Josh said. “It’s always a little annoying, when the bit goes on too long.” </p><p>He handed her the top worksheet from Nicky’s pile. She looked at the the art lesson from earlier that week.</p><p>
<b> <em>When I grow up, I want to be a ________.</em></b>
</p><p>Agatha squinted at the drawing of the strange creature, and the scrawl above it. </p><p>“So? Our son wants to be a dinosaur,” she said, annoyed again. “I wouldn’t get hung up on it; his art teacher is basically in pull-ups. And my hot water is ready, which means you need to get to school.”</p><p>Josh left the paper on the countertop.</p><p>“I’ll drop him off when you’re feeling better,” he said. “And I don't know if you remember, but he still does his C’s as S’s.”</p><p>She wanted to yell, “I fucking know that,” after him out of habit, but the door was shut, and she was staring at the paper.</p><p>
<em> D-A-N-I-S-A-R </em>
</p><p>She laughed, incredulous, and looked at the creature with its claw-hands and crudely drawn smile. She felt the tears spring behind her sore eyes. He wanted to be a <em> Dancer</em>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">
<strong>VII. FRIDAY</strong>
</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha’s doorbell rang that evening at eight on the dot, she figured it was Josh coming back to collect Nicky’s worksheet. She rolled off the couch, fever freshly broken, and braced a hand on the walls. She was still breathing a little hard at the laborious four-foot hike when she opened the door to Rio.</p><p>“Mo makes soup, too,” Rio said, and held up the bag in her hand.</p><p>Agatha was overwhelmed with the urge to walk right into her arms. She started to blame the sick, and the weakness in her limbs, but she gave up halfway. There was nothing left to blame for the way she wanted to kiss Rio on her front porch, except for the exact thing it was.</p><p>She thought about the feasibility of picking up the tissues on the floor, brushing her teeth and hair, and coming back to find Rio waiting patiently. And then Rio asked: “Can I come in?” and Agatha gave up on this plan, too, and let her inside.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>With Rio sitting uncomfortably on the armchair in her living room, still wearing her coat, Agatha wondered if she herself looked as worn out—red-rimmed eyes, pale face, and something resolute in the line of her mouth. </p><p>“Do you—” Agatha paused, and gestured to the stove. “I can make some tea, if you…”</p><p>“No, thanks.” Rio hesitated. “Josh told me you were really sick, I— Sorry. I thought you were just avoiding me.”</p><p>“Nope. Sick,” Agatha said, and on cue, broke into a violent coughing fit.</p><p>“I thought you ‘never got sick,’” Rio said, but she sounded more concerned than anything.</p><p>“Hard legacy to uphold in this line of work.”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth, and her fingers played with a button on her coat. </p><p>“I have to say something,” she said finally. “And I want you to just listen until I’m done. Can you do that, please?”</p><p>Agatha balked at the word please, and felt her achy legs comply. She sat on the couch opposite and curled her feet underneath her. Rio took a deep breath.</p><p>“I never told you how I became a stripper,” she said. “And I’d like to, if you want to know.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened. Then, with great effort, she shut her mouth, and nodded.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“After I got hurt, I was in recovery for two years,” Rio said. “I had two separate surgeries, which meant I was in the hospital in between. No insurance. Lilia paid for all of it.”</p><p>She looked at a spot on the rug, fingers still toying with her coat.</p><p>“On my last week of PT, I was leaving the building, and I saw an ad: ‘Dancers needed. $500 a night. Brunettes. 5’9 or taller.’ I needed a job to pay Lilia back, and I had no high school degree or actual skills. So I bought a pair of heels and went in the next day. I was twenty-one and so fucking terrified. I didn’t think I could be <em>sexy</em>—I barely even knew what sex was. I was literally an altar boy.”</p><p>“You were an <em> altar boy</em>?” The words burst out of Agatha’s mouth before she could stop them, and then she held up a hand. “Sorry.”</p><p>Rio smiled, just barely. “None of the boys in my church could hold the wine without spilling, so the pastor changed the rules. No more interrupting.”</p><p>Agatha bit back her smile, and filed away several follow up questions for later.</p><p>“It was so different than actual dance—I wasn’t prepared,” Rio continued. “I’d only ever had sex with two people—the cheerleader that got me kicked out of my house, and some random widow who came to get her fortune read from Lilia and had a weird thing for my bandaged knee.”</p><p>Agatha felt her chest swell at the innocence of it.</p><p>“In those early years, the guy in charge didn’t give a fuck about anything but profit. Security turned a blind eye to anything bad, and if someone paid enough, they could do whatever they wanted. It was—” She shuddered, and Agatha's grip tightened on the armrest. “It was terrible, for a little while. But those women saved me. Besides Lilia and her sisters, they were all I had. They taught me how to fight for myself. They became my family. So I need you to understand—you counted on me giving up my family. And I can’t do that again.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, the pieces of Rio clicking firmly into place. </p><p>“But—” Rio’s voice wavered, her face fighting for control. “You were also right. Teaching is what I love to do. And you made me want to be the best.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed. <em> Made</em>. Past tense.</p><p>“I’m sorry for what I said.” Rio looked up tentatively. “When you told me I wasn’t getting fired, it meant that I had to decide this <em> impossible </em>thing, and I panicked. It felt like I was seventeen again, or nineteen and in a hospital bed, with everything I love about to be taken away, and having no choice about any of it.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. She didn’t know what else to do without speaking.</p><p>“I don’t blame you for this,” Rio continued. “Not at all. But I also need you to trust that I know what’s best for me.”</p><p>She stood.</p><p><em> No</em>, Agatha wanted to say. <em> Not yet</em>.</p><p>“You can speak now,” Rio said quietly, fidgeting with her button again.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Agatha said. She stood too quickly, her head aching from the sudden movement, and put a hand on the couch to steady herself. “I should have just let you take care of it, and I’m sorry. You were right. I just…” She trailed off, her nose starting to run, and she reached for a tissue. </p><p>“I need you,” she said through her tissue, and Rio’s eyes widened.</p><p>“To stay in the classroom,” Agatha added. “I know that’s not fair, and I’m sorry. But Nicky—”</p><p>She thought of the drawing of <em> Dancer</em>, and her eyes stung.</p><p>“Nicky <em> loves </em> you, Rio. I don’t want <em> him </em>to lose someone that he loves, either. I don’t—” She stopped, the lump in her throat threatening to spill.</p><p>Rio’s face softened. “I worked something out with Wanda,” she said. “I can finish out the year.”</p><p>Agatha’s knees nearly buckled in relief, and then she paused.</p><p>“Does that mean you’re—”</p><p>“I’m not quitting the club, either.” </p><p>Agatha felt the confusion on her face, and Rio looked at her, gaze steady as Agatha had ever seen it.</p><p>“I’m going to help the dancers unionize. They taught me how to fight for myself, and I’d like to return the favor.”</p><p>A smile pulled at the corner of her mouth.</p><p>“You actually gave me the idea,” she added. “When you were shit-talking Hank.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha breathed. “That’s amazing. That’s an amazing idea. You’re amazing, you’re… <em>amazing</em>.”</p><p>She couldn’t think of another word except <em> amazing</em>. She couldn’t think of anything, just stepped forward and cupped Rio’s face. “I—” She faltered, and one hand slipped down Rio’s sleeve to her fingers. </p><p>“Look, about the things you said.” Agatha's voice felt shaky with the unfamiliarity of sincerity. “On Wednesday. About me, and how I…how I feel.” </p><p>“You don’t have to—”</p><p>“I <em> want </em>to,” Agatha said, pulling Rio closer by the lapels of her coat. She could smell it again, that boring, plain soap. </p><p>“I’m—I’m trying, okay? I’m terrible at this, at all of this, and you’re not—” </p><p>She leaned closer, and shut her eyes again, because saying this was too hard, but leaning into Rio never seemed to be. She brought her hand to Rio’s cheek, thumb tracing the familiar curve of her cheekbone, and brushed their noses together. She liked that this was familiar. She breathed against the bow of Rio’s upper lip, in and out. She felt the slow, gentle sway of their bodies. She didn’t kiss her. It was enough to just breathe and sway, and know that her neck smelled like hotel soap.</p><p>“You’re not an inconvenience, Rio.” </p><p>She whispered it with her eyes closed, faces tilted together, and tightened her fingers on Rio’s jaw. “You’re not, you’re whatever’s the opposite of that. You make me—” </p><p>She let out a breath, and then another, and it felt like the start of a laugh or a sob. </p><p>“You make me capital-A-Agatha.”</p><p>She felt Rio exhale, the breath warm against her lips. </p><p>Rio stepped back so suddenly, Agatha’s hands were still outstretched.</p><p>She could still feel her own body swaying, a little.</p><p>“I’m—” Rio paused, and wrapped her arms around herself, like she was cold. Agatha wondered why she’d stepped back, then. Why she wanted her own hands instead of Agatha’s.</p><p>“I’m taking the California job,” Rio said. “It starts in June.”</p><p>Agatha’s knees locked. She stopped swaying.</p><p>“June?” she heard herself say.</p><p>“They want me to run this great summer program, and meet the community before the school year starts, you know? ” </p><p>She paused, tugging hard on her button. It was coming loose from the coat now, thread hanging from the side.</p><p>“It’s a great program,” she repeated. The way she said it, Agatha thought she might be reminding herself.</p><p>She felt her head rush, her knees buckling again, and this time she almost sat.</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio was saying, a hand on her shoulder. “Are you okay?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, head spinning, and forced a smile. It felt grotesque, the shape of it stretching across her face. “I’m happy for you,” she said. </p><p>Rio was looking at Agatha the way she had on Sunday morning, like she wanted to hold her, and Agatha couldn’t have that. Not now, not anymore.</p><p>“I didn’t get a lot of sleep last night,” Agatha said mechanically, and swept her hair over her shoulder. “Can we talk more about it on Monday?”</p><p>Rio just looked at her for a second, hand still on her shoulder. Agatha shrugged it off as casually as she could manage. Rio looked gutted at the motion.</p><p><em> Good</em>, Agatha thought. It was childish and she knew it, and she still thought it: <em> See how it feels to be me. </em></p><p>“Sorry, yeah. Of course.” Rio saw herself to the door. “Get some rest, Agatha. And I’m… I’m sorry.”</p><p>“Don’t be.” Agatha waved her hand. “Can you do me a favor?” </p><p>“Anything.”</p><p>“Take the frog home. I don’t want him, and he’s going to die an untimely death in our classroom.”</p><p>“I took him home yesterday," Rio said with a small smile. "I’m headed up to the farm tonight.”</p><p>Agatha tried not to think about the colorful house, and hot chocolate, and pine trees. </p><p>“I’m glad I’m staying the rest of the year,” Rio said quietly. “I love Nicky, too. You know that, right?”</p><p>Agatha pressed her teeth together and nodded, once. She looked down at the soup container in its plastic bag, still waiting on the entryway bench. Agatha felt the familiar twist in her stomach at the sight of something meant just for her: the pink on Rio’s cheeks in her kitchen, or an exciting piece of mail, or an offering of small animal bones. And she only recognized now, under the scrutiny of Rio’s dark, searching eyes, that the feeling was <em> wonder</em>.</p><p>It was a wonder—that this extraordinary, inconvenient creature had almost been hers. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>This time, when Rio left, Agatha didn’t watch from the window. Her legs gave out and the sobs came quickly, pulling strange noises from her chest. This was a different kind of grief—the end of the picture book and the moral of the story, that people would sooner leave her than love her. She cried until her eyes were bleary and her head pounded. Curled on the carpet over a bed of tissues, back against the sofa, she thought only of Rio on the farmhouse rug.</p><p>Her neck was slick under her hair, and she thought maybe her hackles were gone altogether, like the smooth skin of a tree frog. She turned on her back, looked at the ceiling, and thought about Sandwich. She wondered, wet-faced and aching, which posed more danger to the natural order of things: a wild dog that looked bigger than he was, or a carnivorous runaway frog.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>One hour after Rio left, Agatha stood up from her floor. She breathed harshly through her mouth, her nose red and rubbed raw. She wiped her sleeve across her face, and stuffed her feet in her slippers. At nine-thirty on the dot, she got into her car, the bag of soup buckled into the passenger seat.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>She didn’t bang on the door. She almost couldn’t manage to lift her arm at all, so the knocks were quiet and few. This time, when the door opened, Agatha was overcome with an unfamiliar sensation of anguish tangled with relief. For some reason unknown to her, her eyes filled with tears once more.</p><p>Lilia stood in her doorway, and took in Agatha’s appearance.</p><p>“She’s not here,” she said. “But once again, I think you know that already.”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said, and swiped at her eyes. “I’m here for you. Can I come in?”</p><p>“Oh, that’s it!” Lilia clasped her hands together. “This must be why I brewed a full pot this evening.”</p><p>Agatha sagged against the door frame and sniffled.</p><p>“Tea sounds great." Her voice was hoarse. She’d left her glasses in her car, and the hallway fluorescence swam in front of her eyes. Lilia raised her eyebrows.</p><p>“Oh, my. You really are here for me, aren’t you?” </p><p>She took Agatha’s hand, and tugged softly. “Come, darling. I have a fresh deck I’ve been saving for you.”</p><p>And Agatha let herself be pulled into the apartment of a clairvoyant witch. A madwoman with miracle tea, who opened her door to misfits at midnight, and invited them in.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>

<br/>
</p><p> </p><p>Of all the names Agatha had been called before her tenth birthday, the one she liked the most was <em> goddamn motherfuckin’ liar</em>. There was something about the rhythm of it—much more percussive than <em> good for nothin’</em>, but more thrilling than <em> ungrateful</em>, like fireworks exploding out of her mother’s mouth. It was, of course, Evanora who called her a liar, when Agatha’s face was still freckled and her hair still lay in bright red tangles down her back. She hadn’t yet learned how to brush it properly, or to care whether it was brushed, and every so often Evanora would say, “Your head looks like a goddamn rat’s nest on fire. No child of mine’ll be seen walking around like that.” Agatha would put up a half-hearted struggle, squirming under the rake of the brush, and feel secretly thrilled that her mother had called her <em> mine</em>.</p><p>In the first week of July, when she was nine, Agatha would wake up and walk straight to the harbor. She’d sneak past the fence when it was just starting to get light. Sometimes she’d pause to look at the line of mothers down the street, waiting at the mailboxes for the welfare checks. Evanora would have a bony hand on their mailbox, too, hair in a wrap and gaze pinched toward the other women. When Agatha had asked why she couldn’t just get the mail later, she’d said, "That government mail’s got my fuckin’ name on it. That money is <em> mine</em>.” </p><p>Agatha would amble past the new apartment complexes where she’d see men in suits and women in heels. She’d walk barefoot along the harbor beach, heeding Val’s warnings about needles in the sand, though she’d never seen one. She kept her eyes open for dead things, too, because Val had gifted her a dead bird, and she wanted to find an even more grotesque thing to present in return.</p><p>Agatha would walk all the way to Carson Beach, running to the water and back, until she fell, exhausted, onto the park lawn. She’d stay for the summer movie specials, bug bites and sunburn and salt water blending together into one big itch. She’d scratch at her legs in the grass, watching mothers and fathers holding their children, and think how strange it was that they were all there together. Who was in <em> their </em>driveways, keeping a hand on the mailbox?</p><p>One particular Friday, she’d just finished the Karate Kid double feature, and the excitement of it had followed her all the way home. She made-believe that she was Johnny Lawrence for close to an hour, until she chopped the side-table tiffany lamp, imagining it was Daniel LaRusso’s head. Broken out of her fantasy by the sound of it shattering, she looked at the kaleidoscope pieces on the floor. Johnny Lawrence had broken the lamp, but Johnny Lawrence was no more. Agatha was Agatha again, and she felt the triphammer of her little-girl heart.</p><p>When Evanora came home, her eyes unfocused and hands twitchy, she’d bellowed: “Agatha Harkness, did you break my motherfuckin’ good lamp?”</p><p>Agatha, already hiding in the bottom section of the hall closet, yelled back: “Of course I fuckin’ didn’t! <em> You </em>probably did and forgot about it!”</p><p>Evanora yanked open the closet door and crouched to her level. Agatha wrinkled her nose at the sour, burnt smell of her breath. </p><p>“You are a goddamn motherfuckin’ liar,” her mother said. </p><p>Agatha felt the thrill at the familiar lilting phrase. By age nine, she knew what would happen next. For example, when Evanora called her <em>ungrateful</em>, Agatha knew that the back of her hand would follow. But when she was a <em> goddamn motherfuckin’ liar</em>, she’d be set free to the tune of “Get outta my sight.” </p><p>She held her breath and waited, staring at her mother from the bottom of the closet.</p><p>“You are a <em> shit </em>liar,” Evanora slurred. “But if you’re smart enough to lie, you’re smart enough to go find me a new lamp before the streetlights come on. Get outta my sight.”</p><p>So Agatha scrambled out the door, resolved to be a better<em> goddamn motherfuckin’ liar </em> next time, and wandered the streets until she was sure her mother had fallen asleep. Then she crawled up the fire escape, and dug out her <em> World’s Strongest Glue</em>. She’d been saving it, because it was another gift from Val, and gifts were supposed to be saved for someday. But she didn’t want to turn from <em> liar </em> to <em> ungrateful</em>, so she sat cross-legged on the living room floor, uncapped her gift, and put the colorful lamp back together. </p><p> </p><hr/><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Agatha blinked up at a ceiling that wasn’t hers, and wondered if she’d always been a liar, or if one day, she’d just woken up as one. As she’d grown past nine, her hair had darkened to rust, then chestnut, and her mother had stopped calling her a liar. She’d stopped waiting by the mailbox, or brushing Agatha’s hair, or calling her <em> mine</em>. By the time Agatha was forty-three and lying in a bed that wasn’t hers, she was disappointed to realize that now, she was mostly just called Agatha.</p><p>She grabbed blindly for her underwear, and tried to remember why she was still wearing her shirt. She groaned against the pounding in her skull, and closed her eyes to flashes of a mahogany bar. She remembered Wanda laughing with her body tilted sideways out of her chair and Alice on a stool. She definitely remembered Jen ordering a round of shots “to education!”</p><p>Agatha turned to her side and looked at the lump under the sheet. She hesitated, and then pulled it down. Rio was asleep, her mouth open and brow furrowed. Agatha smiled, then caught herself, hands flying to her face.</p><p>“Fuck me,” she muttered against her fingers. </p><p>“Mmmyeah,” Rio mumbled, and the mattress dipped as she rolled toward Agatha. </p><p>Agatha leapt up, regretting it as soon as her feet hit the floor. She bent over, bracing her hands on the bed.</p><p>“Fuck,” she managed.</p><p>“Hey, are you—” Rio propped herself on her elbows and promptly squeezed her eyes shut. “Okay, yeah. Wow, that is not good.”</p><p>Agatha paused, staring at Rio’s bare shoulders above the sheet. Rio had definitely been wearing clothes at the bar. In fact, Agatha specifically remembered her stupidly hot bomber jacket and hair in loose waves over her shoulders.</p><p>“Did we...” Agatha trailed off, the words feeling too big in her mouth.</p><p>Rio winced, shielding her eyes. “I think we, um… tried?” </p><p>“What the fuck does that mean?” </p><p>Rio glanced to the side, then back. “Educated guess.”</p><p>Agatha turned her head as slowly as she could to avoid another wave of nausea, and her mouth fell open. On the side table, piled in a heap, was a leather strap. Beside it, the unmistakable head of a black dildo poked out of an empty coffee cup. She remembered, suddenly and all at once. Rio groaned, a hand to her face.</p><p>“Fuck, we were way too drunk, and I was way too distracted. I’m sorry; that was not my best work.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t stop looking at the strap, her mouth dry at the memory of Rio trying to pull it on, making needy noises against her neck as her hands fumbled. She pressed a hand to her forehead, the air suddenly too hot in Rio’s bedroom. </p><p> </p><hr/><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>If Agatha had to pick one reason she’d ended up in Rio's bedroom, it was that Rio threw a staff happy hour with the sole intention of getting her into said bed. Agatha had spent the night avoiding her, as she’d done for the last six weeks, and instead, recounted Jen’s second-grade “had an accident and claimed she’d gotten rained on” story to the rest of the group. The seventh time she looked across the room, Rio was in front of her, pressing a drink into her hand.</p><p>“I know we’re not really friends, or whatever, right now,” she said, shifting her weight from foot to foot. “But we still have to spend two more months together. Can I at least buy you a drink? I’d like to say thank you, even if you’re mad at me.” She gestured around her. “This was all mostly for you, anyway."</p><p>Agatha had scoffed and said, “Why would I be mad at you?” and taken the drink. And then another, and another, because Rio’s jacket looked obscenely good, and she’d thrown this party for Agatha, and Agatha was a goddamn motherfuckin’ liar<em>. </em></p><p>Somewhere between drinks four and six, she’d found herself unable to look at anything but Rio’s hair, and her laugh, and the way her jeans brushed the tops of her boots. She could hear Scott singing the Oyster Bend anthem off-key in the background, and somewhere around the chorus, Hank approached them at the bar. Agatha had to keep herself from groaning at the sight of him.</p><p>“Congratulations on a very <em> eventful </em>year, Ms. Vidal. But of course, I’m sure a few more years under your belt will smooth things out in the future.” </p><p>Rio let out a sharp laugh, and then straightened. “Uh, yeah. Thanks?”</p><p>Hank glanced at Agatha. “It does help when you have the inside track, I suppose.”</p><p>“What the fuck did you just say?” Agatha slammed her glass down on the bar and stepped forward. </p><p>“I think I do okay, regardless,” Rio said coolly, and Agatha pushed Hank back a few paces.</p><p>“I’m not as nice as she is,” Agatha snapped. “Say it again.”</p><p>Wanda tapped her on the shoulder and quietly suggested it was time to go. Only when Wanda had a firm hold on her did she back down, shrugging off her hand. </p><p>“We were leaving anyway,” Agatha lied. </p><p>Then she waited until Wanda was gone, and pulled Rio’s elbow firmly to the back entrance. The spring night air made her freeze, the pavement smelling like fresh rain. She put a hand on the wall to regain her balance and watched Rio leaning back against the brick, cheeks flushed and pupils blown.</p><p>“Fuck that guy,” Agatha said to no one. Her voice echoed in the alley.</p><p>“Yeah, fuck that guy,” Rio laughed. She pulled a cigarette out of her back pocket and lit it. </p><p>Agatha plucked it from her hand. She took a slow drag, eyes locked with Rio, and dropped it on the wet concrete. Rio licked her lips, eyes falling to Agatha's mouth. </p><p>“That’s bad for you,” Agatha said, words slurring a little, and stamped it out with her foot. She pressed Rio’s hips to the wall and kissed her.</p><p> </p><hr/><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Agatha opened the blinds, and Rio groaned again, burying her head back under the sheet.</p><p>“You wore that outfit on purpose,” Agatha said. “You threw a <em> party </em>for me.”</p><p>“I wore what? Wait<em>, what</em>?” Rio sat up, and the sheet fell to her waist. Her chest was bare, and Agatha bit the inside of her cheek to keep herself from looking down.</p><p>“This was <em> your </em> idea,” Rio said. “You’re the one that kept touching me, and staring at me, and looking so… <em> needy</em>.” Her eyes wandered, and Agatha scoffed, ignoring the pleasant, prickly feeling of her gaze. </p><p>“I was not <em> needy</em>. It was a random moment of—"</p><p>“Horniness?” Rio finished, smirk pulling at her lips.</p><p>“Weakness.” Agatha looked around for her pants. “You’re here for what, two more months?”</p><p>“Nine weeks.”</p><p>“Eight,” Agatha corrected automatically, and then froze. She waited for the sarcastic reply, but Rio played silently with a loose thread at the edge of the sheet.</p><p>“You’re right. Eight.”</p><p>Agatha grabbed her pants from the corner. “I think we’ve pushed our luck enough, don’t you? It’s only eight weeks. We can handle business as usual.”</p><p>“Business as usual,” Rio echoed dryly. “You mean pretending I don’t exist?” </p><p>“I haven’t been doing that." Agatha tried to pull on her pants in a way that was in any way dignified while still glaring at Rio. Rio watched, shifting in bed, and the sheet slipped lower. She made no effort to cover herself.</p><p>“I’m serious, Rio.”</p><p>Rio leaned back, smirking. </p><p>“What?” Agatha snapped.</p><p>“That’s my underwear.”</p><p>“No it’s—” Agatha looked down, her face heating. “You were wearing <em>pink</em> bikini briefs? Under a biker jacket?”</p><p>Rio pressed her tongue into her cheek. “I was wearing a shirt and pants, too; I’m not sure if you noticed.”</p><p>Agatha glared. “I thought you wore boxers.”</p><p>“I wear a lot of things.” Rio said, distracted. She stared at the tiny bit of pink hem still visible.</p><p>“Rio, stop.”</p><p>“Okay, I <em> get </em> it,” she said, and Agatha almost smiled at the petulant tone. “Although, I’m worried you think I don’t know how to use a strap. For the record, I’m great at it. I do have a reputation to uphold.”</p><p>Agatha felt her lips twitch. She threw Rio her shirt. </p><p>“Oh? And what reputation would that be? Math tutor, or altar boy?”</p><p>Rio caught it and tossed it over her shoulder, her eyes dancing. “Why don’t you come back over here and I’ll give you a detailed demonstration?”</p><p>“<em>Goodbye</em>. I’ll see you Monday.” </p><p>“Mmm, will you?”</p><p>“At <em> school.”  </em></p><p>Rio laughed, and Agatha stared at her.</p><p>“We are not fucking on Monday, Rio.”</p><p>“No,” Rio said, clearing her throat. “It was a one time thing. Or—almost-thing. Or, one one-time thing plus one almost-thing.”</p><p>“We’re adults, it happens.”</p><p>“Exactly.”</p><p>Agatha stood there, one hand on the doorknob. Rio’s skin glowed against olive green, sun pooling against the satin sheets. Agatha’s eyes lingered, trying not to memorize the size and shape of Rio, bare skinned and laid out lazily in broad daylight. She knew it was far too late for all that trying.</p><p>“Was there something else you needed, <em> Ms. Harkness</em>?” Rio stretched and pushed out her chest, and Agatha bit back a noise at her gravelly morning voice. She left, slamming the door behind her.</p><p>The fact of the matter was that after “Why would I be mad at you,” Agatha hadn’t even been trying to lie. <em> Business as Usual </em>was the best course of action that anyone in her position would take. But the other, truer fact was: she’d always been a <em> shit </em>goddamn motherfuckin’ liar. Even when it was an accident. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>In April, Rio replaced her backpack with a leather messenger bag, and started wearing button-ups with rolled-up sleeves and ironed slacks. On the Monday after Agatha woke up in Rio’s bed, she was convinced the change in wardrobe was specifically designed to drive her to desperation. She imagined undoing the buttons one by one, and spent the day fidgeting until the kids had been picked up.</p><p>Agatha collected stray worksheets from empty desks and wondered how Rio was so good at <em> Business as Usual. </em> She watched her take down papers from the whiteboard for Agatha to add to her stack, and Agatha passed the eraser without thinking. Their classroom routine was so familiar now, she couldn’t remember what it had been like before. This was her favorite kind of dance, more than closet-Bachata or weaving around someone in a kitchen at the end of the day. Here, she knew where to put her hands and how close to stand. She knew when to reach and when to duck. She knew where she <em> went</em>.</p><p>She was still thinking about it—the way Rio <em> fit </em>here—when Rio slung her bag over her shoulder. Agatha caught her by the wrist before she could stop herself. </p><p>“Nicky has gymnastics at five,” she said, her voice even. “One-hour class.”</p><p>She tightened her grip, waiting until Rio’s look of confusion melted into realization.</p><p>“Drive time?” </p><p>“Ten minutes each way.”</p><p>Rio stepped toward her, eyes glinting. “You want me to come over tonight for exactly forty minutes?”</p><p>Agatha fought the wave of hot embarrassment in her chest. “Afraid that’s not enough time for you to restore your <em> reputation</em>?”</p><p>“If I recall, I got the job done in Disneyland in half the time.”</p><p>“Hmm,” Agatha said, her embarrassment fading at the intensity of Rio’s stare and the heat gathering under her skin. She glanced at the open space at Rio’s collar. “Not as fast as I did.”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks turned pink, and Agatha smirked. </p><p>“I’ll see you at five-ten,” she said sweetly, and stepped closer. “And since you have issues with tardiness, let me be very clear that if you are one minute late, I will start without you.”</p><p>“You <em> wouldn’t</em>.” Rio sounded genuinely horrified at the prospect. Agatha bit back a smile, and swept her hair over her shoulder.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><hr/><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>As it turned out, Disneyland hadn’t been a fluke. Agatha came twice—once at minute twenty-two, and again at thirty-six.</p><p>“You have to go,” Rio mumbled, and Agatha hummed, her forehead still limp against Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>“God, that was unbelievable," she groaned, and rubbed a hand over her face.</p><p>Rio grinned. “What did you expect?”</p><p>Agatha had expected to be clumsy and a little nervous, because this was <em> Rio</em>—Agatha’s bed was so different than a dark closet full of adrenaline. But when they’d walked silently to the bedroom, Rio had toed off her shoes and bounced eagerly onto the bed, and Agatha had realized the same thing: this was still <em> Rio </em> under the button-ups and messenger bag, with her wide eyes and quiet laughter.</p><p>Agatha rolled to the side, gathering her wits. She glanced at Rio.</p><p>“This doesn’t change anything,” she said.</p><p>“No, of course not.” Rio’s arm was bent behind her head, still resting on the pillow.</p><p>Agatha reached for a new set of clothes, and tried to ignore the obvious: thirty-six minutes wasn’t nearly enough time.</p><p>“Wait,” she said, pausing suddenly. She’d only managed to get her pants halfway up, and somehow Rio was already dressed. “Did you even…”</p><p>“Come? Yeah, I did.”</p><p>“You <em> did</em>? When?” </p><p>Rio smirked, and her eyes flitted down. She ran her tongue over her bottom lip, ears still red from exertion. </p><p>Agatha stared, incredulous. “You came just from going down on me?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said, her voice low.</p><p>Agatha swallowed and cleared her throat, her knees feeling weak all of a sudden. “Well, fuck you and your young libido, that’s not fair. Give me a fucking shout next time.”</p><p>She realized as soon as she said it, and Rio was already grinning.</p><p>“Next time?”</p><p>“I didn’t mean that, just—sorry I missed it.”</p><p>“You were otherwise occupied, it’s okay. And that was fast, even for me.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, and then her words sank in. “So, would you say… is it like this all the time? Like, with anyone else?”</p><p>Since the closet at Disney, she’d been secretly hoping that Rio wasn’t the magic ingredient, and that maybe she could find this somewhere else. But she’d long suspected that wasn’t the case. And now here was Rio, face flushed and gaze averted, presenting the smoking gun: <em> Rio-and-Agatha </em> was something all on its own.</p><p>Rio’s ears turned redder and she pointed out the door. “I think it’s time for you to say ‘I have to go,’ and ‘We shouldn’t do this again, Rio.’” </p><p>Agatha scoffed at Rio’s impression of her, trying to get a handle on the entirely new kind of squirming in her gut. She resisted the urge to crawl across the bed to the other side and kiss the tops of Rio’s red ears.</p><p>“I do,” she said. “And we shouldn’t.” </p><p>Rio nodded, leading the way to the front door. “Terrible idea. Complicated, messy, unethical.”</p><p>“So that’s it, then,” Agatha crossed her arms.</p><p>Rio crossed her arms back, and smirked. “That’s it.” </p><p>Agatha felt the side of her mouth twitch, and bit her cheek to stop it.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>On the third Friday in May, they’d left Rio’s windows open, hoping for a cool breeze while they collided in a tangle of sweaty limbs. The crickets were out, drunk college students stumbling home, and the sound of wild laughter and honking cars drifted into the room. </p><p>“Can I ask you a question?" Agatha gestured vaguely, sitting back on Rio’s thighs, and wrapped her hand around the strap.</p><p>“Sure, but I really can’t focus with your hand like that.”</p><p>“What, like this?” Agatha tugged again, and Rio made a strangled sort of noise.</p><p>“That was kind of my question,” she continued. “Why is <em> this </em>hot, specifically?” She grabbed tighter, and ran her hand up the length. “I mean, like, isn’t the whole point that we don’t have dicks?”</p><p>“It’s, um…” Rio watched her hand, and then blinked, looking back up. She took a deep breath. “It’s more about freedom—like, we get all these fun options. We get to just do what feels good without worrying about breaking the rules, because we’ve already broken the big one. It’s a sexuality thing, and sometimes a gender thing, and sometimes it’s just fun. Or some combination of all three.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly, and Rio smiled.</p><p>“Are you confused?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha scoffed. Then she scrunched her face. “A little.”</p><p>“I like how it feels when I wear it,” Rio said simply. “Do you like it when I wear it?”</p><p>“Obviously.” Agatha tugged again mindlessly, and Rio made a helpless noise. “So you’re saying dick sex is boring for straight people because they’re just scared of having great sex?” </p><p>Rio laughed. “I did <em> not </em>say that.”</p><p>“You definitely did. But don’t worry, I’m not offended.”</p><p>“Why would you—oh.”</p><p>Agatha squeezed her eyes shut, then opened them, avoiding Rio’s gaze. “I didn’t mean it like that,” she said, wishing she could pull the words out of the air and shove them back down her throat. “I was straight for a long time. Cut me some slack.”</p><p>“And you’re not anymore?” Rio raised her eyebrows, a hint of a smirk at her lips.</p><p>“Do we have to do this right now?”</p><p>“No.” Rio smiled, and Agatha shifted, her hands still tracing idly. </p><p>“Can I ask something else?” she said finally. “Something stupid.” </p><p>“There are no stupid questions.”</p><p>“Teachers that say that sound fucking stupid.”</p><p>Rio laughed. “Okay, obviously there are many stupid questions. But being new and curious doesn’t make you stupid.”</p><p>“Okay, so—” Agatha paused again. “Do people ever, like, suck strap?”</p><p>Rio’s fingers curled into the sheets. She looked at the ceiling and nodded. Agatha watched her blink and blush, and she smirked. </p><p>“Rio? Does that happen to be one of those <em> fun options </em>you like? Because I may be new to some of this, but I’ve given some blowjobs in my day." </p><p>Rio shook her head. “You don’t have to do that.”</p><p>Agatha noticed a vein pulsing in her neck, and shifted with the hot spike of satisfaction.</p><p>“Is <em> this </em>why you won’t let me go down on you? Why didn’t you just tell me? You’re not the only one that can put on a show.”</p><p>“No, that’s—it’s not that.” Rio pulled Agatha’s hands firmly away and placed them on her waist. “I just prefer to give, okay? And that’s enough teaching for today. Get on your back.”</p><p>Agatha dug her nails into Rio’s spine. “You’re sounding really confident for someone who desperately wants me to suck her cock.”</p><p>“God, Agatha, shut <em> up</em>.” </p><p>Rio flipped them, and Agatha laughed under the press of Rio’s mouth.</p><p> </p><hr/><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>When the sidewalk sounds had faded and Agatha’s body was pleasantly sore, she conducted her now-familiar routine. She tiptoed down the hallway, grabbed her shoes from the living room floor, and blew out two candles Lilia had left burning.</p><p>“I wasn’t finished with that one.”</p><p>Agatha jumped and staggered back, hand to her chest.</p><p>“Jesus fuck.”</p><p>“Careful,” Lilia whispered.</p><p>Agatha turned to realize she’d braced her hand against a familiar glass tank. </p><p>“I forgot about this little bastard.” She peered at the frog, his wide eyes staring back at her. She took in the various new additions to his home, the colorful decorations and boxes suctioned to the wall. </p><p>“Is that a <em> real </em> fern?” Agatha turned back to Lilia, incredulous. “She’s insane. It’s a <em> frog</em>.”</p><p>“He prefers ‘Sandwich.’”</p><p>Lilia was wrapped in a fuzzy bathrobe, curlers in her hair. The dim streetlight from the kitchen window gave her an eerie halo.</p><p>“What do you want, Lilia?” Agatha tried to sound authoritative despite the fact that she’d been caught sneaking out of an apartment at the age of forty-three.</p><p>“You’ve been avoiding me. I’m old, not stupid. If you were just going to ignore everything I told you during our sessions, we could have saved a lot of time.”</p><p>“They weren’t <em> sessions</em>. I came over a few times and let you do your card trick for free. And by the way, I don’t know how you’ve stayed in business. All the weird moaning, and a crystal ball, I mean, really?”</p><p>“You’re just annoyed because I pulled Death.”</p><p>“You pulled Death on <em> purpose</em>,” Agatha hissed, “to trick me into moving on. And you know what? I don’t care. I <em> have </em>moved on, and Rio and I happen to be having mind-blowing sex in the process.”</p><p>“Spare me the theatrics. And the details,” Lilia said dryly. “She’s still leaving, and you’re still staying. You are resisting transformation, Agatha. You have the potential to become the person you want to be. But now, you’re simply creating a different obstacle because you got bored of the old one.”</p><p>“We’re talking again. Isn’t that progress?"</p><p>Lilia shook her hands, exasperated. “Is it progress to come out from behind one bush just to hide behind another?”</p><p>“Did you choose ‘bush’ on purpose?”</p><p>“You’re impossible.”</p><p>“I’ve heard.”</p><p>Agatha pulled the door open and patted her on the shoulder. “I appreciate your help, Lilia, but I’ve accepted the situation.”</p><p>“No, you haven’t. You’ve just given up.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, her smirk fading. Her grip tightened on the doorknob, and she noticed the deep worry lines on Lilia’s face. She felt a little sorry for calling her a fraud. </p><p>“Those are the same thing,” she said finally. She closed the door softly behind her so as not to wake Rio.</p><p> </p><hr/><p>

<br/>
</p><p>“It’s lemonade stand weather.”</p><p>Rio inhaled, face tilted toward the window, and Agatha copied her. It smelled like a Boston Sunday, just the way Agatha remembered it—the intoxicating combination of bus exhaust and farmers’ market flowers.</p><p>“It’s barely hot out,” Agatha pointed out.</p><p>“That’s the best time for it. Right when the weather’s starting to turn, so when people drive past your stand, they get excited for summer.”</p><p>Agatha yawned, raising her eyebrows. “You were a lemonade stand kid?”</p><p>“Everyone was a lemonade stand kid. You never did one?”</p><p>“Evanora would have just made me charge seven bucks a cup and then taken the profits.”</p><p>Rio hummed. “Sounds about right.”</p><p>Her voice was soft, and Agatha turned to look at her. Rio reached out a hand and brushed her hair gently off of her shoulders. Her hand lingered there for a moment, at the bend of Agatha's neck.</p><p>“Rio. I’m not going to crumble into dust every time I mention my mother. She’s been dead for thirteen years.” Agatha tried to roll her eyes, but she couldn’t quite manage it, holding Rio’s gaze instead.</p><p>“My lemonade stand was free,” Rio said finally. “Payment was praise in good faith to our lord and savior.”</p><p>“No fucking way.”</p><p>“Way.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “That is so much worse.”</p><p>“But I still miss making lemonade and standing in the sun,” Rio sighed. </p><p>“I hate standing in the sun.” Agatha turned on her back again and closed her eyes, just for a second. She thought of the sand under her feet and grass beneath her elbows while she watched movies in the park. She was just picturing the exact feel of it, the sun on her back as she ran along the edge of the harbor, when she felt Rio’s lips on her shoulder. She hummed without thinking, and opened her eyes just as Rio lay over her fully, lips still attached.</p><p>“Can you really go again right now?” Agatha said, but her hips shifted anyway. Her hands fell to Rio’s ass, then the backs of her thighs under the edge of her boxers, holding on just below the curve. She’d already discovered it was her favorite place to hold on.</p><p>“Mmm, yes, but I’m not trying to,” Rio mumbled. “I’m just trying to prove a point. That you do too like the sun.”</p><p>“How exactly are you proving a point right now?” Agatha wiggled her shoulder with Rio’s mouth attached, and dragged her fingers through her hair. Rio sighed against her skin, and Agatha did it again. </p><p>“I’m counting your freckles,” Rio said, lifting her head. “You’re getting more. Probably from all the ‘not standing in the sun.’”</p><p>Agatha pinched her arm. “Fuck off. Not all of us can get a perfect tan, okay?”</p><p>“Okay.” Rio smiled, her legs still slotted over Agatha’s, arm braced beside her head. Her hair fell around Agatha’s face in a curtain, and for a second, all Agatha could see above her was Rio and her dazzling, sleepy smile. The sounds of the city went quiet, and she felt the triphammer of her little-girl heart.</p><p>She swallowed and cleared her throat, turning her head to the side. Rio returned to her side with a flop, and Agatha rose quietly. When she turned back, dressed in her sweatpants and t-shirt, Rio was watching her. </p><p>“I’m sorry you never had a lemonade stand,” Rio said.</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “Maybe you can teach Nicky how to do one.” And then she added, against her better judgement: “You know, if you have time. Before you leave.”</p><p>The words came out colder than she’d meant, and Rio sat up, eyes narrowed. </p><p>“You <em> are </em>still mad at me.”</p><p>“I’m not mad at you.”</p><p>Rio crossed her arms. “Why do you keep coming over if you’re so mad at me?”</p><p>“Why do you keep asking me?” Agatha shot back. “Who was it that sent me a text at eleven-forty p.m. on a Wednesday saying you <em> needed </em>me? That you ‘had to have me right now,’ or else—”</p><p>“Fine.” Rio launched herself out of bed, slinging the comforter to the side. She stood in front of Agatha, hair a wild mess, clad in boxers and socks. </p><p>“If you’re going to be so fucking stubborn about it, I’ll say it.” Rio’s chest rose and fell, her nostrils flaring. “I’m sorry I’m moving, okay? I’m sorry I’m moving because I really like being here. And I can tell you hate me for leaving, and you’re not saying anything, because you’re respecting my decision like I asked. But I didn’t say you had to hide everything you’re feeling—I still want to <em> know</em>. I still want to talk about it. I want to talk to <em> you;</em> I <em> miss </em>you.”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks were flushed with the force of her little speech, her eyes bright. She stood there, chest still rising and falling, and Agatha let out a sound of defeat.</p><p>“I’m not doing this all over again,” she said quietly. “Once was enough. And maybe all of <em> this </em>is just making it worse.” </p><p>“Making <em> what </em> worse?” Rio burst out. “You can’t even say what <em> this </em> is! You know, three months ago, when we were in that closet, you—you called me <em> baby</em>, I heard you. And you told me that you thought about me, and—” Her chest rose faster, but she stood still. “Did you know that was the first time I knew that you even wanted me?” </p><p>Agatha blinked, trying to process this information—this impossible, surely false information. </p><p>“No,” she said finally. “You knew. The way you looked at me—you <em> danced </em>with me, you kissed me, and—no. You fucking knew what you were doing.”</p><p>“No I didn’t!” Rio’s voice was laced with desperation. “I had no idea if I was crazy, if you just liked the idea of it all. I thought you were just bored and having some kind of midlife crisis crush on your young student-teacher, because, let’s be honest, it’s a little too on the nose, isn’t it? Sometimes a textbook scandal is exactly what it fucking looks like.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed the sting of tears.</p><p>“But then, even despite all of that,” Rio continued, “I thought <em> somehow</em>, this was something that could actually be real. And I tried to tell you all of that, in your kitchen. But you just kept acting like this was some terrible <em> accident</em>."</p><p>Her voice wavered. </p><p>“That doesn’t mean I’m happy. I’m not happy. Are you? I mean, still, now, even though we can’t go three days without fucking, you can’t even admit that you’re mad at me, let alone that I mean something to you. That this is more than just sex, that it's never been about just sex, that—” She pulled at her hair. “That you want me to <em> stay</em>.”</p><p>Agatha felt her throat tighten, vision blurring.</p><p>“I’m not going to ask you that,” she said, “if that’s what you were hoping for.”</p><p>She watched the words land, the disappointment settling slow on Rio’s face. Her stomach twisted.</p><p>“You’re right,” Rio said finally. “This is making it harder.” </p><p>She turned around, rummaging through the tangled sheets, and yanked on her shirt. Agatha watched her, the straight line of her back, the familiar clothes, the fall of her hair over her shoulder. She felt the word in her throat, and swallowed it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p> </p><p>The following Friday, Agatha stood in the school parking lot with lemon juice stinging her cuticles and thought again that there was no such thing as "Lemonade stand weather." Rio, in her final solo week, had proposed a school-wide lemonade stand run by the second grade. Of course, Wanda and Jen had salivated at the idea of the optics—"<em>such a fun, practical application of the money unit." "Yeah, H—why can't you be that fun?"  </em></p><p>The kids had been vibrating with excitement, unable to squeeze more than half a lemon each. So, predictably, Agatha graduated from lemonade stand virgin to head mixologist in one afternoon. She hissed at the sting of a particularly nasty cut, and flung the lemon-half into the trash.</p><p>"Have you had anyone taste that yet?" Wanda eyed the Gatorade cooler on the cart, and Agatha wheeled on her.</p><p>"I know how to make <em> lemonade</em>."</p><p>"I've tasted your coffee."</p><p>Wanda dipped a spoon into the batch and brought it to her lips, her eyes widening.</p><p>"It's not that sweet," Agatha said, indignant. Wanda shot her a look, pulling out her phone, and Agatha looked back down at the cooler. “We're out of lemons. Is it really that bad?”</p><p>Wanda didn’t answer, her brow furrowed at her phone.</p><p>"Hey, I haven't seen you in a while," Agatha said after a minute. "Everything good? End of year stuff going okay?"</p><p>"Oh, you know,” Wanda said vaguely. Agatha looked at her more carefully. </p><p>“You have no idea how ironic it is that I'm asking you this, but... are you mad at me?"</p><p>Wanda looked up, surprised. "No, of course not."</p><p>Agatha squinted. "Are you sure? You're acting kind of… <em> something</em>. And I know I’ve made things complicated, and I know I forgot your birthday, and I’m sorry. That was shitty."</p><p>Wanda smiled and put a hand on her shoulder. "I'm not mad at you. And you forget everyone’s birthday."</p><p>"Right. Okay."</p><p>Agatha glanced toward the classroom. Rio was lining up the class, a bag of ice in one hand and the other resting on Oliver’s shoulder. Agatha rocked on her heels and took a breath. She looked at Wanda, lemon juice still stinging her fingers, and scrunched her face.</p><p>Wanda glanced over, then turned to her fully, her phone falling to her side. Agatha looked across the parking lot one more time.</p><p>“Are you about to tell me what I think you’re about to tell me?” Wanda asked, incredulous.</p><p>“No. Nope.”</p><p>Wanda grabbed Agatha by the arms and shook her. “She’s almost here, hurry up!”</p><p>“Stop it,” Agatha said, throwing her hands up in defense. She eyed Wanda, then lowered her voice. “But hypothetically speaking, I might be having… feelings. And hypothetically, I might have no fucking idea what to do about it.”</p><p>Wanda stared. “<em>How </em> did you stay married for so long?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged and squinted, rubbing her eye. The lemon juice smarted. “Ow, fuck. I don’t know, joint taxes and Costco lube?”</p><p>"Have you told her?" Wanda asked gently. “Hypothetically.”</p><p>Agatha fished the ladle out and wiped her hands on her pants-in non-answer.</p><p>"You're an idiot," Wanda muttered. “An idiot that I love dearly, but an idiot nonetheless. <em> Tell </em>her."</p><p>“Is that… <em> J</em>?” Agatha squinted at Jen, jogging towards them with her keys jangling around her neck. She slowed to stop and held out a saltshaker like a relay baton.</p><p>“Ha!” Wanda plucked it from her hand. “Thanks, babe.”</p><p>“This is not what ‘emergency’ means,” Jen panted. “If you <em> ever </em>make me run again—” </p><p>"Trust me." Wanda raised the spoon to her mouth, and turned to Agatha. "Tell her—that’s all you can do. Here, taste."</p><p>Agatha took a sip and blinked at the burst of flavor on her tongue. "Shit. How did you do that?"</p><p>"Well, kids,” Wanda said with a flourish. “A little bit of salt makes things sweeter. A lot of salt confuses your taste receptors so you can barely taste the sugar.”</p><p>“Fuck yeah. Science!” Jen said, savoring a sip of her own.</p><p>“I have to go,” Wanda said, “but I’m calling you tonight, Agatha—<em>do not </em> ignore me. And remember that today is supposed to be <em> fun. </em>Try not to do that sulky thing with your face when you look at her.”</p><p>Jen laughed at Agatha’s thunderous expression, and Agatha shoved her covertly just before the wandering gaggle of children arrived.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>She tried not to look at Rio at all, which was difficult, since they were the sole proprietors of the entire lemonade operation. Rio’s walkie was clipped to the waistband of her shorts, lanyard swinging as she explained the mechanics of scooping one ice cube, and only one, into a dixie cup. Agatha looked around for anything to focus on besides the way the walkie bobbed at Rio’s waistband.</p><p>Her eyes fell on Jen’s star-shaped earrings and she tapped one with her finger, watching it swing. "Those new? I like them."</p><p>"Yeah, actually." Jen rocked on the balls of her feet and grinned. "They were a gift from my girlfriend."</p><p>"Your <em> what</em>?"</p><p>Agatha forgot to be quiet, and Rio shot them both a look. "Sorry," Jen mouthed, and pulled Agatha back a few paces, lowering her voice.</p><p>“My new girlfriend, Jennifer."</p><p>"Oh. So this is, like, a 'dating yourself' thing?"</p><p>"No, bitch, her name is Jennifer. Jennifer Walters. She's a sexy lawyer.</p><p>"<em>Oh</em>. Oh, okay, well I'm really happy for you, J.” Agatha smiled at Jen's puppy grin. "How'd you meet?"</p><p>"Alice set us up, actually." Jen nodded in Alice’s direction, and they watched her across the field, leading a group of kids in an unintelligible game. "Apparently they go to the same boxing gym."</p><p>"Ooh, a boxer. You like 'em strong?"</p><p>"You would know, wouldn't you?" Jen shot back. “How’s <em> that </em>going?"</p><p>"How's what—”</p><p>"You can pull that shit with Wanda all day, but don’t even start with me.”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip. She looked at Nicky, his arms around Luca and Ellie's shoulders as he watched Rio fill a cup from the cooler. He looked taller than she remembered, his hair almost down to mid-back.</p><p>"And how many quarters makes seventy-five cents?" Rio was saying.</p><p>"Three," Oliver blurted with his hand raised. Agatha took a moment to appreciate that he’d even raised his hand in the first place.</p><p>"Did you, like—” She paused and lowered her voice, scrunching her nose. The words felt scratchy in her throat. "Did you always call yourself a lesbian? Like, is that important? Does your girlfriend care?"</p><p>"Whoa, zero to a hundred.” Jen nodded and puffed out her cheeks. "Wow, this is so crazy, because you're not, like, my <em> mom</em>, but—”</p><p>"Stop. Forget I asked.”</p><p>"No, it's great,” Jen laughed. “Look, this is a nightmare, professionally speaking. But I <em> have </em>been waiting for you to join the team, like, forever.”</p><p>Agatha pressed her lips together, the heat burning her cheeks. "This is humiliating."</p><p>"People feel different ways about labels. If you're still getting used to it, just try a few and see how they feel. You don't have to go straight to lesbian overnight. Or ever. There are plenty to choose from."</p><p>Agatha nodded, her chest feeling lighter. "Okay, right. That's what I thought."</p><p>"But also,” Jen added. “You were with a dude for a really long time."</p><p>"You two really love reminding me."</p><p>"So, hypothetically,” Jen nodded toward Rio, “telling <em> someone </em> that you're not straight, and in fact love doing gay shit with them, would probably be nice to hear. Once you’re ready to say it. That's all."</p><p>"Oh." Agatha cleaned the dirt from under her fingernail. “I didn't think about it that way.”</p><p>Jen smirked. "So… you love doing gay shit?"</p><p>Agatha gestured to Rio's waving hand.</p><p>"I have to go do my job now, boss."</p><p>"Oh, I bet you do."</p><p>Agatha shook her head, and took her spot next to Rio.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Fifth grade took the last slot of the day, and Brynn gave Agatha and Rio both hugs when she reached the front of the line. Agatha smiled at her neat overalls and the bright purple frames of her glasses.</p><p>"How's O.B.'s most famous playwright?" Agatha said, pouring her a cup.</p><p>"Good," she replied, hands clasped behind her back. "And no thank you."</p><p>"You don't like lemonade?" Rio asked, amused.</p><p>"It has far too much sugar for my growing body. That's what I heard on PBS."</p><p>"And that wouldn't be PBS Kids, by chance, would it?" Agatha caught Rio's eye and twisted her mouth to keep from laughing.</p><p>"No, not that I’m aware.”</p><p>"Of course.” Rio smiled. "Well, I hear PBS is a big supporter of ice water, if you’d like a glass?"</p><p>Agatha noticed Hank standing off to the side, his gaze trained on Rio. She narrowed her eyes.</p><p>“I’m taking a break; you got it?” She muttered. She didn't her eyes off of Hank.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said, distracted by a kid who was trying to drink directly from the cooler tap. "Hugo, absolutely not. You three, back of the line." </p><p>Agatha left to the chorus of ten-year-old-boy outrage, and walked straight to Hank, arms crossed tight against her chest.</p><p>"Harkness, good to see you."</p><p>"Is it, Hank? You never seem to be particularly glad to see anyone.” Agatha scanned his face carefully, wandering closer. “Except Wanda, actually. Because for some reason, every time I’ve tried to find her for the last couple months, she has some sort of meeting with you. What’d you do, huh? Accidentally watch porn on the work computer?”</p><p>"There's no need to be crude." Hank adjusted his glasses. "Principal Maximoff and I are simply discussing administrative matters.”</p><p>“Ah, yes—<em>Matters</em>. Sounds like porn to me, but whatever you say.”</p><p>Hank stood in silence, and Agatha didn’t move.</p><p>“So,” he said after a beat. “Ms. Vidal has done quite the extraordinary work this year. No doubt under your very close eye."</p><p><em> And there it was. </em>Agatha’s heart picked up speed. </p><p>“This again?”</p><p>“One has to wonder just <em> how </em>close, exactly.”</p><p>Agatha felt her lip curl. "If you have something to say, spit it out."</p><p>"I've been watching you make a fool of yourself this year,” Hank said. “The school board meeting, back to school night. I heard about the field trip, too. You get away with impropriety because you're friends with Maximoff, and Kale, and even <em>Paul</em>. And now this? Frankly, I've had enough."</p><p>"Oh, <em> have </em>you?" Agatha sneered. "Well, thank you for the feedback. I'll be sure to take it under advisement that you’re jealous people actually enjoy my personality.”</p><p>"My wife is a second grade teacher at Old Salem Elementary, as I'm sure you know," Hank continued coolly. "She's been looking to relocate closer to home. Wouldn't it be <em>convenient </em>if something were to suddenly open up?"</p><p>Agatha felt the ground shift under her feet for a moment. The anger rose hot in her chest, and she felt the steady pulse of her forehead vein.</p><p>"Are you <em> blackmailing </em>me?" she growled, barely keeping herself from grabbing his collar out in the open. "Hank, you are about one inch from your expiration date if you say another word, and I'm not talking about your fucking job."</p><p>"I'm sure," Hank said, eyeing her again. "Have a nice day, <em> Ms</em>. Harkness.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>To Agatha's utter annoyance, she couldn't stop thinking about Hank Pym on a Saturday. She woke up, head pounding from a sleepless night of tending to a sick Nicky. She thought about Hank when she made her coffee, and when she dropped Nicky off at Josh's with a guilty “Thank you.” </p><p>As a result of Hank Pym and his vague, needling threat, on the Saturday evening before the last week of school, Agatha found herself in the parking lot. She'd been so distracted, she'd let the work pile up in favor of worrying until the procrastination window had officially closed. The first thing she noticed as she turned the key in her classroom door was that the automatic lights were disabled. Then, as she stepped in fully, she saw the drawn shades, and the familiar side profile at her desk. Rio's face glowed in the light of the green desk lamp.</p><p>"What are you doing here?" Agatha said finally.</p><p>"I have so much to finish," Rio yawned. "And I've been up late packing, and—sorry, here, you can sit."</p><p>"No, it's okay." Agatha waved her off, and settled in the armchair with her stack of envelopes. "Are you working on the certificates?"</p><p>“Yeah. Portfolios?"</p><p>"Yup.</p><p>They worked in silence, and Agatha looked up every now and then, catching the slow blink of Rio's eyelids and furrow in her brow. Other times, she'd watch the grip of her pen, and the flex in her forearm, and try not to think about the practical application of those two things.</p><p>"I'm hungry," Rio said finally, stretching out her hand. "Can I eat your Bugles?"</p><p>"You would have eaten them anyway if I wasn't here,” Agatha mumbled. She saw Rio smile out of the corner of her eye, and watched her pull the bag out of the drawer without even looking. Agatha signed her name on the last yellow envelope, sealing the metal clip, and dropped it heavily on the carpet with the others.</p><p>"Fantastic. Two hours on something they're going to throw away in a week."</p><p>"I still have some of my stuff from elementary," Rio shrugged, her mouth full. "I snuck back into my parents place once and took it. I wrote a <em> lot </em>of journal entries about Julia Roberts that I needed back. You know, in case I ever run into her."</p><p>"I knew you had a type," Agatha smirked.</p><p>Rio set down the bag and smiled, but it was too quick and tight across her face to be real. She gathered her things, setting the pen back in the cup, and pushed back her chair.</p><p>"Wait," Agatha said. Rio looked at her expectantly, and Agatha felt the jitters return to her legs. "Before the happy hour, after the field trip—you know the time when we weren’t really talking?”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, and Agatha nodded, too, gathering momentum.</p><p>“I missed you, too. And I missed talking to you this week. But this was—this is nice. Being here, working next to each other, just—being together."</p><p>"Agatha." Rio's voice sounded strained, and she pushed the hair off her forehead.</p><p>"Just wait here, okay?" Agatha stood. "I have something for you that’s long overdue."</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Agatha returned with two dixie cups full of Wanda's hidden stash of Russian vodka, and banged on the door with her foot. Rio opened the door and looked at the cups, and raised her eyebrows as the smell hit her nose.</p><p>"I never said thank you. To <em> you</em>," Agatha said, pushing past her, and handed out a cup. "I couldn't have made it through this year without you. And I know I don't say what I'm thinking, because, well, for a lot of reasons—the main one being that I was raised by wolves. Or, one in particular. But I—" She paused. "Hold on." </p><p>She tipped her head back and emptied the cup in one swallow, wincing at the taste. Rio smiled.</p><p>"I always needed you here, and I always wanted you here," Agatha said, the vodka burning her throat. "I'm sorry I made you feel like I didn’t."</p><p>Rio bit the inside of her cheek, and then downed her shot, too. She crushed the cup, and pocketed it. Agatha knew it was to hide the evidence of alcohol on the premises, but selfishly, she wished Rio wanted it as some sort of keepsake to remember her by.</p><p>"And now?" Rio said, her voice rough. “And tomorrow, and the day after that?”</p><p>Agatha swallowed. "I'm still working on that one."</p><p>Rio nodded, and eyed the paper tree above them.</p><p>"I'm going to miss this classroom, you know. You did a really fucking good job with it.”</p><p>"We don't have to go home yet," Agatha said, unable to keep the hopeful edge from her voice. "If you wanted to admire the decorations one last time."</p><p>Rio's lips twitched. </p><p>"What did you have in mind?"</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>One hour and one shot each later, they sat on the floor, backs against the desk, breathless with laughter.</p><p>"Wait, no," Rio said, gasping for air. "I swear I'm going to get it this time." </p><p>She uncapped the pink marker and hurled it at the paper taped to a kid's desk. The poster sported a crudely drawn figure with a cutout of the weekly mailer—specifically, Hank Pym’s head—taped to the top. His outline of a body was filled with jagged attempts, and Rio's latest throw landed right at the crotch.</p><p>"There go his balls!" Agatha exclaimed, and Rio fell to her side with the force of her laughter. Agatha laughed, too, and looked down at Rio’s head in her lap. </p><p>"Your turn," Rio said, wiping her eyes. She sat back up, and Agatha uncapped the green marker. She looked at it.</p><p>"If I get him, you have to answer a question."</p><p>Rio eyed her. "Okay."</p><p>Agatha aimed with sudden intensity, and nailed paper Hank in the arm. She looked at Rio, her head leaned back, and thought of a farmhouse backyard.</p><p>"Are you excited about California?" Agatha asked quietly.</p><p>Rio's mouth twisted into a half-smile.</p><p>"I am," she said. "At least, I think I am. I'm excited about fourth grade, and I’ve been working on the summer program since February, and I think it’s going to be really good. It’s a little terrifying, leaving Lilia, but it’s what she wants for me. And it’s what I want. So, yeah. I'm excited.”</p><p>She looked up at the tree. “But I’ll miss the sugar maples,” she added quietly. “And the fireflies."</p><p>Agatha nodded, the lump feeling larger in her throat. “Everything’s just starting for you. I remember what that felt like. It’s amazing.”</p><p>“I’m thirty, not twenty,” Rio said with a laugh, and Agatha shook her head.</p><p>“Thirty <em> is </em>the new twenty. Enjoy it.”</p><p>Rio looked at her sideways, and took the next marker from the box. Her throw landed on Hank's neck. She paused, biting her cheek. </p><p>“Did you get a divorce because of me?"</p><p>"<em>What</em>?" Agatha stared, and then laughed. "That’s fair, I guess. No, not entirely. We had a terrible marriage before I met you.”</p><p>Rio nodded, and Agatha added, “But also, yes? A little. Not for the reason you think.”</p><p>“You mean <em> not </em>because you were so turned on from a lap dance that you had to dump your husband of twenty years?” Rio smirked, tongue in cheek. </p><p>Agatha smiled, and shook her head. She looked at Rio. “You asked me why I wasn’t more confident. And I realized that I used to be. I didn’t even really recognize myself anymore. And then I knew that who I wanted to be had nothing to do with Josh.”</p><p>Rio tapped Agatha’s knee with a marker. “Did you become who you wanted to be?”</p><p>“You can’t ask three questions in one turn.” </p><p>Agatha threw the next marker, and it hit Hank in his large cartoon toe.</p><p>"<em>So… </em>” she said, rolling the cap on the floor. “You’re a lesbian.”</p><p>"Is that a question?"</p><p>"No, I just mean—do you have any other labels, or things, that you go by? Or just that one?"</p><p>Rio looked surprised, and Agatha glared.</p><p>"Stop looking at me like that. How many times do I have to tell you I'm not a bigot?"</p><p>Rio laughed. "I was just surprised—it's nice of you to ask. I use a lot of labels, depending on the day: genderfluid, nonbinary, androgynous, you know. If the shoe fits.”</p><p>“Oh, okay. Yeah.” Agatha nodded.</p><p>“You can ask,” Rio said with a smile.</p><p>Agatha groaned and shook her head. “Fuck me, maybe I am a bigot. What does that mean? Like, what should I do differently?”</p><p>“My pronouns are she/her. So you’re doing that right. But I don't really fuck with <em> woman </em> or <em> man</em>. And you can ease up on the ‘good girls,’ too.” Rio smirked, toying with the hem of Agatha’s shirt.</p><p>"Oh, I'm sorry," Agatha said automatically, feeling the embarrassment hot on her face. "I should have asked earlier. Like, way earlier."</p><p>“It’s okay, you’re new here. And I'm a little hard to define.”</p><p>Agatha quirked her eyebrow. "So no 'good boy,' either?"</p><p>Rio's cheeks reddened. "Um, no, that's. That one's okay."</p><p>"Noted,” Agatha said, looking at Rio’s mouth and wanting nothing more than to use that, too, in practical application. She cleared her throat. “You’re too slow; I’m going again.”</p><p>She hurled the marker at Hank's chest, and it hit the desk next to the paper. She realized she hadn’t lied yet, in a game of questions.</p><p>"You missed," Rio mused.</p><p>"I missed," Agatha echoed, and then, as Rio reached for her next marker, Agatha closed her eyes, and added, "I still have a question, though, if that’s okay."</p><p>Rio looked up, surprised, and withdrew her hand.</p><p>Agatha considered asking something cheeky, like “What’s the best sex you’ve ever had,” and “Was it me?” But she looked at Rio, and thought about the salt in her lemonade that dulled the sweet, and different words caught in her throat. She felt sudden tears sting at her eyes, and sniffed to pull them back. Then, finally, she leaned back against the desk, rolled her head to the side, and looked Rio in the eye.</p><p>"Do you think I'm a good person?"</p><p>Rio looked startled at the question, eyes widening.</p><p>Agatha turned the marker cap over in her fingers. "I'm not a good friend, I know. I forget birthdays, and I don't lie to make people feel better. But I lie about the big things, even to you, and I don’t know. I think that makes me a bad person, maybe."</p><p>"People lie about big things sometimes,” Rio said softly. “And I like brutal honesty over feeling better. How do you feel about this shirt, by the way? I meant to ask."</p><p>"Pinstripes are for toddlers and train conductors, Rio.”</p><p>Rio looked down at herself and laughed. She reached for Agatha’s face. "Look around—look what you do for kids that aren’t even yours. You do all of this every day, just because you want to. How could that come from… <em>Bad</em>?”</p><p>Agatha glanced at the paper leaves and the twinkle lights she'd strung for twenty years, and saw them differently. She stared, trying to wrap her mind around the evidence, and Rio pulled her head gently down again.</p><p>"And the way you are with Nicky," she said, thumbs stroking her cheeks. "When I see you with him, I wish you'd had the kind of mother that loved you like that. Maybe then you would let other people know you, and give you things, and maybe you'd keep more in your desk than scavenger-hunt bird skeletons and expired mail.”</p><p>Rio rose onto her knees, still cradling Agatha’s jaw, and Agatha looked up at her. She took in her messy hair, and the strange gleam in her eye against the paper branches, and felt the sudden need to brace herself. She flattened her palms against the linoleum and pressed down.</p><p>“Which, <em>yes</em>,” Rio continued, “I know, I go through your desk when you're not here, okay? I can’t help it, because when I open your drawers it feels like I'm looking at you. And I know that's weird, and creepy, but then, maybe I'm weird and creepy. Because I just look at your miserable treasures and think that, by some insane making, I love that mean, sad, extraordinary woman so much, so inconsolably, that I’m standing in an empty classroom at lunchtime, looking at a dead bird.”</p><p>Agatha felt every last bit of air leave her lungs. Her hand gripped the marker, knuckles white, and she watched Rio swipe at her eye.</p><p>“You…” Agatha’s voice faltered, the sound strange and hoarse. She tried again. “You <em> what</em>?”</p><p>Rio’s chest rose and fell, her eyes shining. </p><p>“Cat’s out of the bag,” she said finally. “I’m, like, very in love. With you. So, yeah, there’s that.”</p><p>Agatha’s thoughts moved as if through water. She thought of the mornings she’d spent watching Rio in a kid-sized desk, leaning back in her hoodie, sipping out of her matching travel mug and teasing Agatha about a lap dance. It seemed like a different time. She felt like she’d been a different person. She hoped she was, at least. She didn’t know why she was thinking any of this now.</p><p>“You can say something.” Rio tucked the loose strands of hair behind her ear. “Or not, or we can just go. And forget about this. Yeah, let’s—”</p><p>Agatha pulled her head down swiftly, finding her lips with her own, and Rio kissed her back, scooting closer on her knees. Agatha gripped the back of her thighs, her favorite spot, neck bowed back at the angle. She let out a helpless noise at the feeling of Rio’s mouth against hers again.</p><p>“I really did miss you,” Agatha mumbled. “A lot.”</p><p>Rio hummed and brushed her palms against Agatha’s hair, then slipped them under her shirt. Agatha swallowed, the feeling of Rio’s hands on her skin making her pause.</p><p>“Wait,” Agatha breathed, holding Rio’s hands in place. “I just… need a minute, okay? Can we do you first?”</p><p>“First with what?” </p><p>“Anything, I don’t know,” Agatha said. “I want to do something for you. But I don’t know what to—” She stopped, a noise of frustration escaping her at her own clumsiness. “Do you like anything else? Besides fucking the living daylights out of me?” </p><p>Rio laughed, and ran a hand through her hair. She draped her arms over Agatha’s shoulders.</p><p>“Just to be clear,” she said. “I love fucking the living daylights out of you.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but her cheeks felt warm.</p><p>“And secondly, it’s not that I don’t like anything else. I really do want you to go down on me—actually, I think about it, like, all the time. I thought about it this morning.”</p><p>Agatha stared, indignation hot on her tongue, and Rio held a finger to her lips to stop the impending outburst. </p><p>“Shush, I know you wanted to. It’s a strip club thing, I think. I never liked being too vulnerable; it didn’t feel safe. So, I just shut off that part of my brain, and took control of the situation, and now I just—I don’t know if I can enjoy that. And if you do it, I want to enjoy it.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her chin, hands circling her back. “I just want to make you feel good. As good as you did for me,” she said, sitting back on her heels and looking up. “That’s all I’m asking. And if that means fucking the living daylights out of me, I’m extremely fine with that.”</p><p>Rio laughed, then paused, chewing her lip. She leaned down, picked up an open marker, and tossed it at the paper. It hit Hank square in the forehead.</p><p>“You want to go down on me right now?” Rio asked. </p><p>Agatha kissed her. “There are no stupid questions,” she said against her mouth, and swallowed Rio’s laugh.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Rio’s legs rested over Agatha’s shoulders, her hand on the desk to keep the chair from swiveling, and Agatha stopped for the third time.</p><p>“I know it’s Saturday, but people still live within a five-mile radius of this school.”</p><p>“I don’t care, fuck, keep going,” Rio panted, pressing Agatha’s head closer. Agatha glared, neck stiff and knees chafing on the carpet square. She snapped the waistband of Rio’s underwear.</p><p>“Why do you even want me to do this if you’re not even going to take your clothes off? Does this even feel good? I’m going to fucking rugburn your clit off.”</p><p>“God, <em> yes</em>, stop whining,” Rio said, pulling the back of her head even harder. “I don’t care how sexy you are, I’m not stripping naked in a classroom—this place is disgusting.”</p><p>“You worked at a <em> strip club</em>,” Agatha said, and then, smirking, “You think I’m sexy?”</p><p>“I’m pretty sure I told you that the night we met.”</p><p>“Kind of figured you said that to everyone.”</p><p>“I do,” Rio grinned. At Agatha’s glare, she added: “<em>Did</em>. And I never meant it until you, even in that awful outfit.”</p><p>Rio tugged Agatha’s hair, and her face tilted up automatically, a noise escaping her throat. Rio’s cheeks were flushed, and Agatha felt her breath leave her at the picture of her against their classroom. She wondered how she would ever sit at this desk again without seeing this. She kissed Rio’s thigh again, and closed her eyes for a second, inhaling against her skin. When she opened them, Rio was still looking at her, hands gathering Agatha’s hair over her shoulder.</p><p>“You’re the most beautiful person I’ve ever seen,” Agatha mumbled against her leg, and then, catching herself, added, “Is that word okay? ‘Beautiful?’”</p><p>Rio nodded silently, her cheeks turning pinker. Her hand tightened in Agatha’s hair. Agatha swallowed, and snapped her waistband again.</p><p>“Are you sure you don’t want me to move these out of the way? How am I supposed to get good at this? And if we’re going by your personal average, the germs won’t even have time to—”</p><p>Her last word was muffled by Rio’s hands pulling her own underwear aside, and finally pressing Agatha against her with her full strength. They both let out loud moans, and Agatha forgot all about the conversation, and the burn of her knees, and the crick in her neck. She forgot everything except the taste and feel of Rio on her tongue, every sound that came out of Rio’s mouth, every muscle twitch in the legs around her neck. </p><p>The wet warmth was strange and new, and she traced different shapes with different pressure until something worked, and Rio’s hands tightened again. Agatha followed the sounds from her mouth: the hums, the <em> yesses</em>, the breathless instructions—“slow down,” “back and forth,” “up a little higher”—which she dutifully followed for the first time in her life.</p><p>She was in the middle of thinking of how this tasted strange and new, and worrying what would happen if she didn’t like it, when she heard sounds coming from her own throat. Her breath was catching in quiet, reverent noises against Rio, because somewhere in all the thinking, she’d forgotten to realize that all of it felt unbelievably good—the the press of her nose against hair and bone, the soft, molten feel against her tongue, the flesh under the dig of her fingers. She doubled her efforts to the rise and fall of Rio’s cries, and felt, for the first time, what she’d been given instead of what she’d lost.</p><p>She thought about the sun on her back at the harbor, and freckled shoulders, and grass under her elbows. She thought of the world’s strongest glue, and the way the pieces of a lamp fit back together to make new kinds of shadows on the wall. She thought of dead birds in drawers, and the word <em> mine </em>in Evanora’s mouth.</p><p>Rio held Agatha’s head tighter against her with both hands. Rio, who’d stayed next to her as the maple leaves turned orange and fell, and the branches grew tiny buds of green. Rio had given from the very beginning, Agatha understood now. She’d followed Agatha into a supply closet, built her a haunted house, and braided half her hair. And now, with her head feeling fuzzy and her tongue finally pressed flat against Rio, high-pitched “<em>Agatha </em>”s echoing against linoleum, Agatha thought, for the first time, that she might actually love her own name. She heard it again, the broken cry in Rio’s throat, and sensed that same deafening, shuddering shift she’d felt the moment she looked at Rio in her classroom and remembered Lady Death. </p><p>Rio had said she loved her, and Agatha suddenly saw her the way she’d never let herself. She saw Rio’s nervous hands holding a bag of soup on her doorstep. She saw a hopeful grin and a Goonies t-shirt, and an offering of beer and hot chocolate from a kitchen that wasn’t even hers. She saw the determination in her eyes as she pitched a lemonade stand for the entire school, because Agatha had never had one.</p><p>Agatha could no longer pretend it was a catastrophe in the making or a problem of circumstance. Because before all of that, on the very first day of school, Rio had gotten into her backseat, looked her in the eye, and said: “You’re not a stranger.”</p><p>Rio’s voice reached a crescendo that could surely be heard around the limits of their small town, and Agatha pressed harder and faster with her tongue. She hoped the townspeople with their torches and pitchforks heard what they were doing in excruciating detail. Inexplicably, she hoped they’d heard that Rio loved her, too. </p><p>Rio came against Agatha’s mouth with a strangled noise and her thighs pressed against her ears, and she said again, “Fuck, Agatha, I love this. I love this, god, I love you.” And Agatha found she had no choice but to believe it, because Rio, as it turned out, had never been a liar.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Rio asked once she’d caught her breath, and Agatha wondered why <em> she </em>was asking that, not the other way around, until Rio reached for her face with a look of alarm, and Agatha realized she was crying.</p><p>She remembered the first time she’d kneeled in front of Rio in the teachers’ lounge, dressed like Morticia Addams, feeling like Rio had poisoned her instead of the other way around. Now, she knelt before Rio in her own classroom. She looked at someone-who-loved-her, and said, “I <em> am </em>mad at you.”</p><p>Rio leaned forward and brushed the tears on her cheeks. “I know,” she whispered. “I’m mad at you, too.”</p><p>Rio kissed her softly, then sat back on her heels, grabbing her pants from the floor. She dusted them off, and Agatha watched. She knew to wait, in a way she hadn’t before. She knew Rio would take her time to say more, that she thought about what she meant before she said it. Only after Rio was dressed again did she tie her hair up and perch against the edge of the desk. She looked at Agatha, and said in one breath: “I’m mad that you can’t just magically solve all your shit, and tell me every single detail about the way I make you feel, and the kind of future you want, and whether I’m in it.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed and leaned her head back against the door. She looked up at the leaves, limp with the air from the vents through the year.</p><p>“But that’s not very fair either, is it?” Rio said softly.</p><p>Agatha blew air out of her cheeks, and thought of Lilia’s cards. She thought of the picture of the grim reaper and the gravestone, and the looming threat of transformation. </p><p>“Turns out, change is famously very difficult.”</p><p>Rio gave her a half smile, her brow still furrowed, and reached for her bag.</p><p>Agatha groaned and stood up straight. “Okay, listen. If you tell Lilia what I’m about to do, I’ll poison both of you in your sleep.” She took a deep breath. “There’s something I want to show you.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t ask where they were going once—not when Agatha pulled onto the highway, and not when she pulled into a Wahlburger’s parking lot and returned with two cheeseburgers and truffle fries. As Agatha drove on, Rio ate her burger, curled her leg underneath her, and nodded her head to “Big Yellow Taxi.”</p><p>Joni sang, <em> “Don’t it always seem to go… </em>” in that upbeat way of hers, and Agatha looked over at Rio. She liked when Rio was in her passenger seat, her shoes kicked off at her feet. Maybe she even loved it, a little. </p><p>Rio was looking out the window at the moon, and Agatha thought of Lilia. She wondered how Lilia learned such unknowable things, if they came to her in dreams, or if she looked at Agatha and saw it written plain as day in the lines of her face.</p><p>“I do <em> want </em>to change,” Agatha said over the folksy guitar. Joni ooh-wopped, and Rio looked at Agatha. She bit into a french fry.</p><p>“Yeah, I know.” She dipped the other half in ketchup, and held it up to Agatha’s mouth.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“It’s a little concerning that you didn’t ask where I was taking you,” Agatha said, wrapping her arms around herself. “If I was trying to murder you, you’d be dead by now.”</p><p>“If you were trying to murder me, you wouldn’t have eaten me out then bought me a burger.” Rio looked at the trees towering above them.</p><p>“What if that was my thing? Like, my serial killer calling card?”</p><p>“Then I would want more for you, professionally.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, and nudged her shoulder after a beat. “You’re really not going to ask why I brought you here?” </p><p>“You usually tell me anyway if I’m quiet long enough.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “You’re secretly a little mean, aren’t you?”</p><p>“And you’re secretly sentimental.”</p><p>“Take that back!”</p><p>Rio gestured to the headstone in front of them.</p><p>“Fine,” Agatha said. “But I am not sentimental about <em> her</em>.”</p><p>Rio’s face softened, and she took Agatha’s hand, prying her fingers open so she could lace hers through.</p><p>“That much, I know.” She looked at the headstone again, and Agatha smirked at the familiar engraving.</p><p> </p><p>
<b> <em>EVANORA HARKNESS</em> </b>
</p><p>
<b> <em> ____ - ____ </em> </b>
</p><p>
<b> <em>INSCRIPTION HERE</em> </b>
</p><p> </p><p>“I never emailed them back,” Agatha shrugged.</p><p>“I like it.” Rio considered the text. “A permanent ‘Fuck you.’”</p><p>“It wasn’t on purpose,” Agatha said. “Josh was freaked out because I didn’t have any sort of reaction when she died. He thought I was on the verge of a breakdown, so he did all the things you’re supposed to do: a funeral that no one came to, a will reading for a will with nothing in it, and a headstone in a cemetery in Saugus, where she was born.”</p><p>“That was nice of him.” Rio squeezed her hand.</p><p>“It was,” Agatha said. “But I never did have that mental breakdown.”</p><p>“It’s not mandatory, you know.” </p><p>Agatha rocked on her tiptoes, then kicked the bottom of the headstone with one foot. </p><p>“I lied,” she said, still looking at the stone. “Last week. I do hate talking about my mother. I do feel like I’m going to crumble at even the slightest goddamn inkling of Evanora Harkness, even thirteen years later. And since I met you, I’ve been thinking about her a lot.”</p><p>Rio eyed her, and Agatha saw the crinkle in her nose that meant she was confused. But she didn't say anything, so Agatha closed her eyes, and told her anyway. She said what she’d never spoken aloud to anyone—not Jen, not Wanda, not even Josh. She stood over Evanora’s grave, took a deep breath, and said: “My mother told me every day that I was the worst thing that ever happened to her.”</p><p>“Agatha—” Rio squeezed her hand again, and Agatha shook her head. </p><p>“Let me finish, okay? Just let me get it out.”</p><p>Rio nodded. Agatha took another breath, steadier this time, and looked at the name, EVANORA HARKNESS, in those loud, unforgiving capital letters.</p><p>“She told me that I ruined her life. That’s what she’d say, when she was drunk or high, or just mad for no reason. She’d pull me close, like she was going to tell me a story, and say: ‘Agatha, did you know that when you were born, you ruined my fuckin’ life?’ She’d say, ‘I was just about to be somebody, and you took it all away. Poof!’ And then she hated me for it until the day she died.”</p><p>Agatha paused, staring at the inscription, feeling the burn of tears in her throat. She turned to Rio, and found her eyes already wet.</p><p>“I don’t want you to think that about me,” Agatha said, her voice wavering. “I can’t ask you to stay here for me, Rio. Because I just don't think—I can't risk it. Ruining your life, too.”</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything, and Agatha squeezed her hand tightly, the tears coming fast again, until finally, Rio pulled her into her arms. </p><p>She let out a half-sigh and half-sob into Rio’s hair, and they swayed there together, standing at Evanora’s grave in the dark. Agatha didn’t know how long they stayed like that. </p><p>“I’m so <em> sorry</em>, Rio,” Agatha said finally. “I really am.”</p><p>Rio wiped her own cheeks and gave a watery smile. “If your mother was alive, she’d have fewer teeth, and my handprint across her face.”</p><p>Agatha snorted, and held her tighter.</p><p>“And I want to tell you that you could never ruin my life,” Rio added softly. “But I guess neither of us really know that for sure. Maybe one day, it won’t be so scary for you.”</p><p>“God, but what if I’m miserable and scared forever?”</p><p>“Close your eyes,” Rio said, and Agatha did. “It’ll go like this. One day, you’ll wake up, and you’ll make your coffee. You’ll put on your purple robe, and bring in the mail, and wake up Nicky, and you’ll realize that you’ve gone all morning without thinking about all the worst things that could happen. Or all the things you’re scared of. And it’ll happen more and more, until it starts to feel a little exciting—all the things you don’t know, that are going to happen next.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her with her eyes still closed. She didn’t say the obvious—that she couldn’t yet say what Rio needed to hear, and Rio couldn’t stay for less. It was simple and inevitable, like two vines of Bittersweet nightshade that twisted together along a fence before growing their separate ways.</p><p>Agatha just kissed her, lips pulling softly until Rio hummed, and Agatha brushed her tongue against hers in their familiar way. She felt Rio’s breath against her upper lip, and felt overcome with a sharp, needy pull to do this more, and again, and all the time. She kissed her harder, nails digging into the back of her neck.</p><p>“Okay, um,” Rio said, breathing hard against her mouth. “Do you have a thing for this? Like, cemetery stuff? Not that I have an issue with it; you just seem a little… wound up.”</p><p>“Not all of us had the pleasure of an orgasm served up on a silver platter this evening,” Agatha said, biting at Rio’s lip, and Rio laughed. </p><p>“But,” Agatha added, “I do like the fact that my mother would hate me desecrating her grave with a gay makeout.”</p><p>“You’re gay?” Rio said, deadpan, and Agatha shoved her. Rio dissolved into laughter, and Agatha couldn’t help but laugh with her, pushing her in the direction of the car.</p><p>“Oh, wait, hold on.” Rio jogged around the tree, and Agatha frowned as she returned with a sprig of small, white flowers. “Saw these on our way up.”</p><p>Rio laid the flowers down on Evanora’s grave, and Agatha shot her a look.</p><p>“Relax,” Rio said, taking her hand. “It’s poison hemlock.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth dropped in surprise, and then she couldn’t do anything but kiss Rio again. </p><p>“You are so hot right now,” Agatha said, grabbing Rio’s ass. “Now, be a good boy and finger me in the parking lot of this very creepy graveyard.”</p><p>“Yeah, yes. Let’s do that. Now.” Rio tugged her forward. They stumbled to the car, Rio tripping and laughing against Agatha’s mouth. They lost the gravel path and backtracked, bumping their foreheads together in the dark like children in a playground collision. Rio kissed the sore spot and Agatha laughed, and as Rio pressed her into the backseat, Agatha thought that maybe all of this would be a little less scary tomorrow.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Agatha woke to the sound of pounding on her front door in between the ringing doorbell. She’d been dreaming, the kind where the sounds crept in. She and Rio had been playing in a band, the pounding taking the shape of a bass drum. Rio’s arms were wrapped tightly around her midsection, and Agatha, half-asleep and wanting nothing more than to get back to the band’s performance, buried her head in Rio’s neck to muffle the noise.</p><p>When the doorbell rang for the sixth time, she remembered all the things she was supposed to think of when she was unexpectedly awakened—was Nicky okay, and where was her phone, and was she late for school? She pulled on her robe and walked quickly to the door. Standing on her porch, face pale and eyes wide, was Wanda.</p><p>“Thank fucking god, open the door,” she hissed, looking around.</p><p>“What? What is it, what happened?” Agatha’s heart raced as she undid the chain. “Are the twins okay?”</p><p>Wanda squeezed past Agatha and shut the door behind them, holding a hand to her forehead. Agatha felt awareness settle into her limbs as she registered the quiet panic on her face. </p><p>“Hey—” Agatha grabbed her shoulder to keep her in place. “Is everyone okay?” </p><p>“Yes, I’m sorry. Everyone’s fine. Agatha, Hank called me this morning.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “Okay, what’s the deal with Hank? Why have you two been ‘discussing administrative matters?’ Is this about my job?”</p><p>“No, not exactly,” Wanda said, shutting her eyes for a second. She rested a hand on her head, taking a deep breath. “I’ve been trying to convince him to <em> retire</em>. I’ve been meeting with him since March, and I’ve thrown him every offer I can think of. I thought if he was gone, then Scott could move up to fifth grade like he’s wanted, and then fourth grade would be open if—”</p><p>Wanda looked over Agatha’s shoulder, and Agatha remembered too late that she’d forgotten to shut the bedroom door. Rio stood in the entrance to the kitchen, and Agatha’s breath caught. She wore Agatha’s flannel, the fabric hanging over her bare thighs, hair egregiously messy. She looked like she’d been thoroughly and completely fucked—because she had—but Agatha didn’t remember being quite so reckless. In fact, she realized as she looked at her that there would be no way around the hickeys smattered across her neck and bruises on her thighs. </p><p>“Uh… hey,” Rio said finally, her voice hoarse. </p><p>“Hi.” Wanda took in her appearance, and looked pointedly at Agatha. She looked a little like she was about to laugh, or cry—Agatha wasn’t sure which. “Sorry to interrupt.”</p><p>“Apology not accepted,” Agatha grumbled, her cheeks feeling warm. </p><p>“Okay, well, you should hear this part, too, Rio.” Wanda took another deep breath, and looked between the both of them. “Hank called me this morning to tell me that he saw you two idiots. Together.”</p><p>“What? Where, in the classroom?” Agatha demanded, and felt Rio sidle up next to her. She smelled like <em> Rio</em>, warm and sleepy, and Agatha wanted to bury her face in her neck again despite the urgency of the situation.</p><p>“No, at the happy hour in April.” Wanda paused. “Wait, what happened in the classroom?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Agatha and Rio replied at once.</p><p>“Great. Fantastic. You guys couldn’t keep it in your pants for, like, thirty more seconds? Who makes out behind an <em>Applebee's</em>?”</p><p>“What’s he going to do?” Rio asked.</p><p>Agatha half-laughed. “He wants me to quit, so his waspy wife can take my job.”</p><p>“That’s not happening,” Wanda said firmly.</p><p>“Wanda, I think we’re officially out of options here.”</p><p>“No, we are not.” Wanda ran her hand through her hair, and Agatha realized she was still in her pajamas. Her heart swelled with sudden affection for her friend. Wanda had been trying to keep Rio here. </p><p>“Look, if he called me, that means he hasn’t called Ralph yet,” Wanda muttered, pacing. “He probably got tired of waiting for you to take the bait, and decided to escalate, now that we only have a week left.”</p><p>“The teacher feature,” Rio exclaimed, clutching Agatha’s arm. </p><p>Agatha and Wanda looked at her blankly, and Rio rolled her eyes. </p><p>“Oh my god, have you two ever read a single email? Here.” She held her hand out for Wanda’s phone, and Wanda complied, peering over her shoulder. </p><p>“Hank is the awardee this year.” Rio showed them the teaser. “It’s going to detail out his career accomplishments and the district is going to present him with the award.”</p><p>“That’s why he can’t tell Ralph,” Wanda said, realization dawning. “It would overshadow his pathetic five minutes of fame.”</p><p>“The article comes out on the last day of school,” Rio read, and rubbed the bridge of her nose in thought.</p><p>Agatha resisted the urge to sit down on the floor and curl into a ball. “You know I want to keep my job, but how are we going to pull this off in one week?”</p><p>Wanda rounded the kitchen, brows still knitted together. “I might have a plan,” she said, and reached for the coffee grounds. Agatha squeezed her eyes shut as Wanda paced by the coffee maker. </p><p>“Fuck,” she said, lowering her voice so only Rio could hear. “<em>FuckFuckFuck</em>.”</p><p>She gripped the edge of the barstool and willed it to be ten minutes ago, curled into Rio and dreaming about their make-believe band. This was much less enjoyable.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said.</p><p>“You can go, you know.” Agatha looked at her and shook her head. “You could just go home right now. You’re so close to getting out of here. You’ll be fine.”</p><p>They glanced at Wanda puttering around the kitchen, her fingers drumming against the counter, eyes focused at a spot on the wall.</p><p>“I know that look,” Agatha whispered. “She’s like a shark on the scent of blood. A non-threatening shark, maybe, like a baby one, but still. Whatever she’s got, it’s going to be fucking insane.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth twitched, and she stepped closer. She reached up and rubbed the corner of Agatha’s left eye.</p><p>“You have sleep crusties,” she murmured, and Agatha smiled. </p><p>“I’m in,” Rio added. “Let’s take care of this thing for good. I don’t want any loose ends lying around on my account.”</p><p>“Great,” Wanda called, three cups of coffee in front of her. “Now that that’s settled, sit down. You two need to tell me <em> everything</em>, and then we’ll figure out how to put a stupid old man in his place and save both of your careers.”</p><p>“Oh, is that it?” Agatha said, but she sat anyway.
