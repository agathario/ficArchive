<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>It’s Agatha’s turn to laugh because she wasn’t aware the next prophet stumbled into her office on a random Monday in September, “And you know this how Miss Vidal? Did Teen Vogue give a lowdown on me this week? How dare Agatha Harkness want to be in control of her own company. What a crime it must be to want to be on top. As if you wouldn’t want the same.”</p><p>“Well, personally, I’m perfectly happy with being on the bottom Ms. Harkness.”</p><p>—</p><p>Agatha Harkness, CEO of Harkness Enterprises, has been stuck in a sexless, passionless engagement for nearly fifteen years. With no plans to change it, she continues about her life until Rio Vidal struts through her office doors for an internship and makes her question everything she’s ever understood about lust and power.</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The clicking of Agatha Harkness’ red bottomed heels are the only sounds echoing off the glass walls of the sixtieth level of <em>Harkness Enterprises </em>as the CEO exits from the elevator. </p><p>With her sunglasses perched atop her head and her Prada purse clutched in her elbow, she carries an exterior harder than most. That much is obvious by her lack of greetings and poor attempts at maintaining more than a tight smile as she passes by her employees. Though, she is nothing if not observant, so when she finds a few sets of eyes she’s not familiar with, her stride stutters for a moment. </p><p>There's a group of young adults reeking of Dior Sauvage and desperation. Most of them have to be in their mid twenties. They’re a mixture of suits and dresses. All of them too pristine for any actual business to have been conducted in. They’re obviously trying to make a good impression but Agatha finds she immediately wants to humble them all and tell them all about her suit jackets with permanent wrinkles embedded in the elbows from how many times she’s had to roll up her sleeves and get to work on short notice.</p><p>But that’s the unprofessional part of her. Instead she hums in their direction, not stopping her eyes on one person for too long. She feels their eyes lingering onto her though and that brings a gentle smile to her normally stoic face. With a quick flip of her wrist, she makes a brief motion to her assistant, Wanda, and the eager redhead clicks into place, sidles up in front of her to hold open the door for them to pass through. Wanda is halfway to securing the glass door behind the both of them when Agatha’s voice startles her into a jolt.</p><p>“What’s the field trip of children doing outside of my office, Maximoff,” she asks as she rounds the corner of her desk, discarding her purse across the surface and sending a few papers to the wayside. </p><p>Wanda swallows while bouncing back and forth on her cherry red heels. “<em>Those </em>would be this year's interns.”</p><p>The CEO pauses as if digesting the thought. Her eyes quickly find the staggering young crowd through her floor to ceiling glass walls and find they’re all in conversation, laughing at one another. From just a glance she gathers that most of them are quite familiar with each other. They all smile like they're comfortable, in an element they are used to. But there’s two that are closer than the rest. A man with dark hair and fresh stubble, red lensed glasses covering his eyes and a walking stick in his hand. He’s leaning on a woman with raven hair, dark beady eyes surrounded by even darker eyeliner. Her lips are pale but shiny with bright white teeth, showing a small frontal gap, trapping her bottom lip. As she tucks a loose strand of hair behind her ear, Agatha’s breath hitches. </p><p>“Is this the best that we could do,” she snarks as she takes her seat behind her desk. “Did we put out an ad for interns or Abercrombie and Fitch models?”</p><p>She says it more to herself than to Wanda, but the premise lands all the same.</p><p>“Ms. Harkness, you know you approved these applications months ago. They’re here for their introductions with you. It’s on your calendar that I so graciously curated for you.”</p><p>Agatha sighs. <em>Right. </em>The calendar that Wanda had begged her for approval to install onto her laptop <em>and </em>phone so that her assistant didn’t have to stress about moments exactly like this. Agatha briefly remembers something about the redhead having to up her anxiety meds to the highest dose right after she got her promotion. She still thinks Wanda has a flair for the dramatics.</p><p>“I recall hon,” Agatha groans. “Let’s just get this over with. Who’s first in the line of questioning?”</p><p>“It’s not an interrogation you know…” Wanda pulls a notepad from her pocket and thumbs through the first couple of pages. “Rio Vidal is up first.”</p><p>Agatha tucks the name away in the back of her head, “Can you give me some time to go over their applications first. I'd like a chance to get ahead of them, which I can’t do if I don’t know the right details to hold over their heads.”</p><p>Wanda rolls her eyes, “Please try not to scare away this set of interns. They actually seem genuine this time around.”</p><p>“All the more reason <em>to </em>scare them away,” Agatha retorts. “When was the last time you heard Harkness Enterprises and the word ‘genuine’ used in the same sentence?”</p><p>Wanda laughs and backtracks through the door, throwing the last words over her shoulder, “I’m not sure that’s the compliment you think it is, but to each their own.”</p><p>When Wanda leaves her alone, she thumbs through the manila folders on her desk holding the applications of each of the interns standing outside. She finds the one labeled <em>Rio Vidal </em>and she quickly scans through the file: </p><p><em>Rio Vidal. 25. New York University student in her senior year, majoring in Law &amp; Business. Grew up in Manhattan— </em>hmm local<em>—and currently night lighting as a bartender in a bar in the Lower East Side. Near the top of her class. Previous internships with a few notable corporations as well. Not to mention, she’s highly recommended by all of them. </em></p><p><em>Interesting enough, </em>Agatha muses. </p><p>When Rio walks through the doors of her office, the word <em>interesting </em>definitely echoes through her mind as she feels the air shift. It’s the young woman who just caught her eye a few moments ago. </p><p>Agatha sets her jaw and crosses her legs as she feels the rush of Rio’s strong presence invade her space. As quickly as she can, she gives the younger woman a once over in hopes of finding something out of place—something to hold over this woman because as it stands, Agatha can tell this woman is going to be a problem. All she finds is a perfectly tailored black suit with a green undershirt undone a few notches to reveal just enough of the swell of her breasts to draw attention. She’s bold. Her shoes are white sneakers, perfectly polished and free of any scuffs. She’s confident enough to not feel obligated to wear heels. Not that she would need them anyways. She’s tall enough on her own by simply commanding the room with her sly grin alone.</p><p>It’s… rather sexy. But Agatha reels that thought back before she can even let herself entertain it. </p><p>“Ms. Harkness,” Rio says as she extends a hand across the desk. “A pleasure to meet you.” </p><p>Her raspy tone does little to help the growing thoughts in the older woman’s head and when their hands meet across the table, it’s hard not to notice how nimble Rio’s fingers are. Agatha doesn’t hesitate to sit back down in her seat, eager to delve into familiar territory. </p><p>Rio takes the seat across from her and settles into the chair like it was made for her. A throne for a king. She slouches comfortably into the cushions, her knees crossing languidly and her right arm bending across the back of the chair to hang limply. Her lips are turned into a smirk, eyes carrying a hint of challenge. If Agatha hadn’t read her file prior to this, she would’ve known she’d be pursuing law by this demeanor alone. </p><p>
<em>Fucking lawyers. </em>
</p><p>When their eyes meet, Agatha internally stutters and it catches her so off guard that she has to physically clear her throat to snap out of it. Rio seems to notice, but Agatha would rather melt into the floor than let her speak first so she fast tracks it back to the entire point of the meeting. </p><p>“So Miss. Vidal, what brings you to Harkness Enterprises?”</p><p>Rio tucks her tongue against her cheek and Agatha feels like she needs to prepare to be called out for her weird behavior thus far, but surprisingly Rio re-adjusts herself upright into her seat and seemingly brushes off whatever comment she had prepared in regards to that. </p><p>“Well, honestly, I’m looking to network. I want to create some lasting business relationships while getting experience under my belt,” Rio says sharply. The words roll off her tongue with ease and Agatha is clinging onto every one. “Your company is among the highest rated women owned businesses in the world. It’d be an honor to learn from you and work under this roof.”</p><p><em>Feels rehearsed, </em>Agatha thinks, but her chest fills with pride anyways. The surge of confidence resets her body and she’s quickly fronted into the persona she’s spent years perfecting. She does these interviews daily. She’s had far more tantalizing people sitting across from her and they haven’t so much as gotten a millimeter under her skin. So what if Rio’s attractive? It doesn’t change the fact that Rio’s in Agatha’s element. Not the other way around.</p><p>She straightens her head on her shoulders, feeling innately more at ease.</p><p>“I appreciate that Miss Vidal,” the CEO responds sincerely, a smile grazing her once tightly shut lips. “I’m sure the networking will come in handy once you graduate. Relationships are of the utmost importance when it comes to law… as I'm sure you know by now. I understand you have an extensive intern history?” </p><p>Rio laughs, leaving Agatha to wonder what’s so amusing. But then Rio seems to relax and by extension, so does Agatha.</p><p>”Yes. I’m quite aware of the need for representation from most higher ups. I’ve worked with many CEO’s over a couple of internships. You guys are definitely the illusive types.”</p><p>Agatha knits her brows together, lifting one in curiosity. “Bad experiences?”</p><p>Rio laughs again, her tongue reappearing against her cheek as she locks onto Agatha’s strong gaze, “Nothing in particular. Just, CEO’s tend to be very <em>uh</em>—controlling. Makes my work cut out for me.”</p><p>“<em>Oh,” </em>Agatha smiles, uncrossing her legs and sitting back in her chair. She’s been called worse, but that’s always been by no names online or the few men whose egos get the better of them. Never has an intern been so directly… indirect. Color her amused. “Tell me how you really feel…”</p><p>Rio’s gaze feels like it’s burning her skin alive with the amount of intensity weighing it down. It’s like she’s analyzing, reading a script only she can see. Every word she hears, she clings onto like it’s a tool to use to further her agenda. Agatha gets the impression Rio finds nothing meaningless in the way that every facet of information can be used to her advantage to some degree.  </p><p>“I wasn’t implying you in that statement,” comes Rio’s raspy voice. “Unless you feel as though I should’ve been?”</p><p>Agatha tilts her head, her smile sharpening at the edges. “Should you have been?”</p><p>Rio leans forward, voice dropping just a touch, playful but edged with something heavier. “Well… if you <em>were</em> the controlling type, Ms. Harkness, I imagine I wouldn’t mind so much.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrow down onto the younger woman with precision—a dare for her to continue toeing this line. Rio doesn’t seem bothered with her fingers tapping against her knee and her tongue poked into her cheek. All Agatha can think about in this moment is how those two appendages could be put to much better use.</p><p>Agatha’s brows flick upwards, amusement flashing across her face like a blade of light. Bold. Almost reckless. “You do remember you’re my intern, don’t you?” Her tone is casual, but the warning hums beneath the words.</p><p>Rio doesn’t flinch. Instead, she smirks, resting her elbow against the arm of the chair, her gaze locked on Agatha’s. “Oh, I remember. That’s half the fun.”</p><p>Agatha exhales through her nose, something between a laugh and a scoff. She leans back in her chair, crossing her legs with deliberate slowness, a queen regarding a subject who’s dared to toe the line. “I think it would be in your best interest to tread carefully, Ms. Vidal.”</p><p>Rio tilts her head, mirroring Agatha’s earlier gesture, eyes glinting with mischief. “Then it’s a good thing I’ve never been afraid of a challenge.”</p><p>Agatha hums, “You’re either brave, reckless, or very stupid. I haven’t decided which.”</p><p>“I’ll make sure to make the decision easy for you then,” Rio says with a laugh, but her voice is still heavy. She’s still leaning forward ever so slightly. “I <em>do</em> think you are the controlling type. But it’s not a bad thing. You’re a <em>powerful </em>person. Control is your super power. I think you should own it.”</p><p>Agatha wants to laugh, but her mouth feels dry, lungs devoid of air. “I didn’t see a minor in psych on your file.” </p><p>“<em>Ah, </em>so you’ve studied me,” Rio chuckles, placing her clasped hands into the desk in front of her, leaning into her elbows as she narrows her dark brown eyes at Agatha. “Is that what you were doing in here? Reading up on me?”</p><p>“Were you watching me?”</p><p>“S<em>tudying </em>you,” Rio corrects. That smug smile reappears on her face, clearly content with the ground she’s gaining between the two of them. Agatha can’t recall the last time she felt so equally rivaled in a conversation that the power dynamic was clearly supposed to be shifted in her favor. She tries to blame it on law student types, but Rio seems to just embody these traits to her core.</p><p>The silence breaks as Rio cranes her neck around, curiously looking around at the endless panels of glass surrounding the front half of Agatha’s office, “Anyways, it’s hard not to with your glass walls. I’m surprised you don’t have any blinds in here.”</p><p>Agatha laughs. When she had designed her office, she’d originally wanted to be the furthest away from anyone who could bother her, but she’d come to realize she’d liked the weight of her presence being unavoidable. And, perhaps, she liked being seen. Like some rare exhibit.</p><p>Rio didn’t need to know that.</p><p>“No need for them,” Agatha replies smoothly.</p><p>“Because you like to be watched,” Rio asks with her jaw firm and eyes lined tightly. Her tone straddles the line between question and accusation, but Agatha hears the provocation. She knows what Rio means, even if the intern hasn’t earned the right to say it. A reckless little test. How far could she push before Agatha snapped?</p><p>“What gives you that impression,” Agatha nearly spits as she grits down on her teeth in annoyance. Rio seems to tighten upon noticing the tension shift, though Agatha can tell she isn’t truly surprised by it. </p><p>“Nothing. That was incredibly inappropriate of me,” The apology lands hollow, like a door shut too quickly.</p><p>Agatha should leave it there. A smarter woman would. But the sight of Rio’s young, cocky, annoyingly magnetic smirk sets something alight in her chest.</p><p>“Don’t get all shy now. What did you mean by that<em>? </em>”</p><p>Rio sits quietly for a moment as if deliberating her next move. The air feels thick and hot. Despite the intern suddenly being the one in the hot seat, Agatha feels it all the same. She tries not to notice how sharp Rio’s jaw is when it’s set or the way her arms flex against the blazer as she crosses them, but she fails in all aspects. </p><p>“I think you like the attention.” Her gaze is dark, steady. “You thrive on the power you hold over people. You want them to look at you. To remember who’s in control.” A pause, deliberate. “You love being on top.”</p><p>It’s Agatha’s turn to laugh because she wasn’t aware the next prophet stumbled into her office on a random Monday in September, “And you know this how? Did Teen Vogue give a lowdown on me this week? How dare Agatha Harkness want to be in control of her own company. What a <em>crime </em>it must be to want to be on top. As if you wouldn’t want the same.” </p><p>“Well, personally, I’m perfectly happy with being on the bottom Ms. Harkness,” Rio says with an unmistakable glint in her eye and that <em>damn </em>tongue poking against her cheek. Not that Agatha didn’t know it sooner, but after that, it’s impossible to think of this conversation as anything but a warning as for what’s to come. “And if you want to be in control… you can be.”</p><p>The audacity knocks the air from Agatha’s chest, though she refuses to show it. Instead she folds her hands together, slow and deliberate, as if she’s weighing whether to shred the girl’s career on the spot.</p><p>“You’re very sure of yourself for someone who’s been here less than five minutes,” Agatha says coolly.</p><p>Rio shrugs, unbothered. “Maybe I just know what I’m looking at.” Her eyes flick briefly over Agatha, bold enough to make it obvious, bold enough to make it sting.</p><p>“Careful,” Agatha warns, but it comes out quieter than she means.</p><p>Rio tilts her head, studying her, lingering like she wants to see how deep she can dig the knife. “Careful… because you might fire me? Or careful because you don’t want me to be right?”</p><p>The air between them snaps tight, charged like a storm about to break.</p><p><em>That </em>hits Agatha right between her legs, butterflies spreading into her stomach. Agatha has to let the room go silent in an effort to control her composure because the slightest movement in response is a surrender she’s not willing to give. The obvious tension between them is heading down a path that is, in no capacity, HR friendly as some choice words are definitely hanging on the tip of the CEO’s tongue. There’s a lot she could say and even more she wants to say, but she can’t.</p><p>So, with her tongue nearly bleeding from how hard her teeth have been baring into it for the last minute, she allows a slow smile to form on her face, “You think I don’t know what you’re doing?”</p><p>“I’m not sure what you mean,” Rio sits back in her chair, seemingly satisfied with the reaction she’s gotten, though she slides her hands into her pockets and Agatha briefly wonders if she’s restraining herself too. </p><p>Agatha laughs, her curious mind getting the better of her. She shouldn’t be entertaining this, not by a long shot. Maybe it’s all in her head. She is forty three years old and probably hasn’t had sex in a decade, so her body is just reacting to this incredibly attractive young woman by making her think there’s this undertone to what she’s saying. Because there’s no way… right? </p><p>“Did anything else on my file catch your attention?”</p><p>Rio is looking at her with bright eyes, her teeth biting her lower lip and head cocked just gently to the side. And fuck if it’s not one of the sexiest gestures Agatha has ever seen. What the fuck is going on with her. She needs space and she needs it now. A second to think would even be a close second to what she needs. She should mention something about Rio’s history. Maybe ask if her other job will interfere with what she needs to do here, but she fucking can’t. She needs to clear her head. Agatha shakes her head, “Nothing special I’m afraid.”</p><p>Rio <em>tsk’s </em>her tongue. “That’s a shame. I was hoping to leave a lasting impression.”</p><p>“I guess you’ll have to try harder,” Agatha says dismissively, swallowing thickly.</p><p>“Oh you can count on that, Ms. Harkness,” comes Rio’s response. Agatha swallows three more times, ignores the way her stomach flutters when Rio follows up her comment with a wink and all but thanks god when the younger woman stands up to leave. But not before she looks over Agatha and nods in the way of the bowl of candy resting neatly towards the corner of the desk. “May I?”</p><p>When Agatha follows her finger to the candy, she laughs. “Help yourself.”</p><p>To which Rio does and Agatha immediately regrets it because not only does she pull the wrapper off of a sucker with her teeth, but she sticks her tongue out fully before placing the candy directly on her outstretched tongue, pulling into her mouth with a pop. The way her eyes never leave Agatha’s sends a shiver down the CEO’s spine. </p><p>“Te veo,” is the last thing Agatha hears before the door shuts behind the young woman. This is the cliche part where Agatha says she lets out a breath she didn’t know she was holding. She’s not sure what's louder in fact; the door closing or her lungs releasing her final shred of dignity. </p><p>Every single intern after that makes her wish she’d kept Rio in her office for just a moment longer because absolutely nothing stands out to her. They all have the same backgrounds with the same ambitions. It just became redundant after the third one took their seat. Now that they have all come and gone, leaving her with an empty office and a moment to breathe, she finds herself drawn to the picture of her and her fiancé Ralph framed on the corner of her desk. It’d been there for years. Something else to collect dust and honestly, she’d hardly ever noticed it. But today, she needs the reminder of the life she's worked so hard to keep. She’d almost let herself slip today. </p><p>After a few hours of meetings, she lets herself leave her office in hopes of finding something to keep her from crashing behind her desk. Normally she’d ask Wanda to take care of getting her some coffee, but the need to get in some extra steps prevails. Maybe some fresh air will help with clearing her mind. Stepping outside of the front doors, the air fills her lungs. She inhales as many times as it takes to make her chest feel clean. She loses count after the fifth inhale. </p><p>When she returns to her building with a warm tea in hand, the walk back to her desk feels like an eternity too long. Everyone stops to greet her. The elevator stops on every floor. She has to walk around a janitor cart stranded in the middle of the hallway. But somehow, none of that lasts as long at the second she passes by the intern bullpen. She knows she shouldn’t look, but she does it anyway. With a quick glance she turns her head to the left and it’s no surprise that there is already a set of eyes watching her. </p><p>They connect for a moment. Not long enough to be anything but an accident, but both women know better. </p><p>Agatha locks herself in her office for the rest of the day. </p><p>With her head clear and the realization that she has a fiancé waiting for her at home for dinner, she packs things up for the day. She makes a pointed effort to leave after all the interns, making sure to have Wanda instruct her the exact moment they left.  </p><p>She makes it out of the building without a hitch and her driver Christian is waiting for her out front. As soon as the door closes behind her, a weight lifts off of her back. Despite normally coming home to an empty house, Ralph is there tonight. Agatha never really thinks anything of his presence or his absence, but today, she could’ve used the alone time.</p><p>He always talks about work. What this customer did and what that coworker didn’t do. It’s always work. It’s like that is all they had become. Two roommates who talked about their work-filled days and then pretended the other didn’t exist for the rest of the night. It had been nearly twenty years of this routine and Agatha had just adapted to it like she adapted to everything else in her personal life. So while Ralph drones on about whatever problems he faced throughout his mundane day like some insufferable background noise, Agatha finds herself falling into the old habits she tried to avoid earlier in the day. The kind of habits that got her in trouble so many years ago. </p><p>Rio Vidal. An enigma Agatha just knows she’s going to have to figure out if it’s the last thing she does. Her looks had been the thing to draw the older woman in, but her brazen demeanor is the thing that kept her in place. Of course Rio has pretty privileges. Anyone else would’ve been barred from working for life. But Agatha let Rio dig in her nails. She gave her a platform to perform and she wasn't disappointed. She’d just have to decide whether she’d made the biggest or best mistake of her life. </p><p>“Agatha,” Ralph's voice finally cuts through her inner thoughts. She finds his blue eyes and immediately feels the guilt wash over her tenfold. “Where’d you go just now?”</p><p>Agatha smiles tightly. “Nothing honey. Just work.”</p><p>He nods understandingly, but when he doesn’t ask her to elaborate, she breathes a silent sigh of relief. She’s better than then. She’s <em>stronger </em>than this. </p><p align="center">—</p><p>The next time she sees Rio, it's through her steamy-fogged glasses as she pours an incredibly hot cup of coffee in the breakroom. She doesn’t always wear her glasses, but on the occasion she does, it’s usually a heavy workload day. The glasses go in tandem with her constant coffee refills.</p><p>“Aren’t I supposed to be the one fetching that for you,” Rio’s voice hits her ears like a melody as the raven haired girl strides up next to her, leaning her back against the counter beside them.</p><p>Rio’s eyes still carry the same intensity as yesterday and Agatha briefly wonders if that’s just always going to be how the younger woman looks at her. Not to mention, she’s wearing another suit—the same bold choice of letting her chest be nearly exposed by the lack of closed buttons. If Agatha’s eyes dip into uncharted territory for a split moment, Rio doesn’t act like she notices.</p><p>“I think I am perfectly capable of pouring my own coffee,” Agatha says as she recenters on pouring an obscene amount of creamer into her cup. “This is my third one after all. I think I’ve gotten the hang of it.”<br/><br/>“<em>Psh, </em>Those are rookie numbers,” Rio immediately counters, crossing her arms and causing the collar of her shirt to pop out just a little more. “I have at least two cups before I even leave my driveway.”</p><p>The CEO widens her eyes, snapping her head over to the younger woman, but loses her train of thought once more at noticing the sudden repositioning of Rio’s shirt. To keep her mouth from uttering something inherently inappropriate, she pulls the stifling hot cup up to her lips. “So are you speed running your way to a heart attack?”</p><p>Rio laughs, her eyes dropping to the floor. It’s the first time she’s let her eyes leave the CEO and Agatha doesn’t forget it. She starts to feel bare without them. “I'm Puerto Rican. Coffee runs in my bloodstream or whatever.”</p><p>“Black, I take it,” Agatha asks, because it only makes sense that Rio would like her coffee black, just like she seemingly likes everything else. Her hair, her clothes, her taste in makeup shade.</p><p>“The only way to drink it I’m afraid,” Rio confirms, turning her head back to settle on eyeing the bright colored cream circling in Agatha’s cup. Her gears are turning with a slick comment in the works, but Agatha is quick to interrupt. </p><p>“Shouldn’t you be doing something more productive instead of psychoanalyzing me today,” Agatha mutters, drawing amusement from the way Rio’s eyes seem to sparkle at the mention of yesterday’s interaction. It must have stuck with her as well.</p><p>“Well I had a coffee run scheduled,” She eyes Agatha’s mug. “And that fell through, so I am currently open to psychoanalyzing as it stands,” Rio retorts, eyes still gleaming as she turns to face Agatha head on and the CEO suddenly feels like she’s backed into some metaphorical corner. “Do you need help with anything? Is there anything I can… take <em>care </em>of for you?”</p><p>There’s plenty of things that quickly come to the forefront of Agatha’s mind, but she swallows them down with a sip of her coffee and relishes in the burn on the back of her throat. Rio watches the action intently like she’s always digging for more. <em>Freak, </em>Agatha thinks. She briefly wonders if Rio could hear it with the way the woman smiles as soon as the thought crosses her mind. And then as if the universe likes to see Agatha suffer, Rio steps impossibly closer, eyes dipping down onto the CEO’s lips as she all but whispers against them.</p><p>“Did you think about what I said?”</p><p>Agatha short circuits for a moment, taken aback by not only the sudden proximity but the way her breath catches in her throat at something as simple as a question leaves Rio’s mouth. “I’m sorry?”</p><p>Rio licks her lips, eyes flickering back up into Agatha’s bright blues, “What I said yesterday. Did you think about it?”</p><p><em>Oh you have no idea, </em>is what comes bubbling up to the older woman’s lips, but “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” comes out instead.</p><p>“Liar,” is all that Rio whispers as she takes a tentative step back and puts some, in Agatha’s opinion, much needed space between them. “Would it make you feel better to know I thought about it? About you? …And our conversation of course.”</p><p>The absolute <em>gall </em>of this woman is going to kill Agatha dead. </p><p>“Is toeing the line of work appropriate and borderline HR violation a hobby for you or something,” Agatha muses, her eyebrow raising as Rio nears both the break room door and the precipice of the dangerously thin line Agatha has drawn between them.</p><p>Rio just chuckles like she isn’t bothered in the slightest. “Or something…” </p><p>And then she exits and so does a weighted breath from Agatha’s lungs.</p><p>On the journey back to her office, she finds that neither her mind nor her coffee mug had left the break room with her. While she’s disappointed about the coffee, she’s thankful she’s been given a moment of Rio-free clarity. The woman hasn’t left her mind. When she walks past ‘the bullpen’ full of intern offices, she fights off every urge to meet the brown eyes watching her every step successfully.</p><p>The reward she grants herself is finally sitting herself back into her desk chair, though the feeling that she’s losing control settles inside of her like spoiled milk—uncomfortably. She stares at a framed picture of her and Ralph on her desk. The woman in the picture feels like she’s from another lifetime, someone so distant from her true self that she can’t even recognize her sometimes. It’s them from college. A picture taken on an old film camera from the campus paper photographer who Ralph had been friends with at the time. She’s sitting on his lap, arms wrapped around his neck as they smile into the lens without a care in the world. It was taken before they had started dating. Before Agatha had become someone completely different. She wondered if she would ever be strong enough to bring her back.</p><p>After recent events, part of her hoped so. </p><p align="center">—</p><p>A few days later and it’s the first time her legal interns will be sitting in one of her quarterly meetings. She’d wrestled back and forth with having them sit out until she was sure they could be of some use, but knowing she’d once been eager to learn too helped her dial back some resentment. </p><p>It’s not the others fault that Rio has tainted her trust. </p><p>So with her laptop tucked under her arm, she makes her way to the conference room where she’s the last one to arrive. The room silences as she enters, all eyes falling to her powerful stride as she takes her rightful spot at the head of the long, wooden table. There’s a few heads she doesn’t recognize, but mixed in are the ones she does recognize all too well. </p><p>Tony Stark being one. She hadn’t expected his company as he’s often too hard to track down, but when they do meet in the same room, it’s like water and oil. They <em>really </em>don’t mix. </p><p>She tries to ignore his eyes as she passes by, her jaw set in place. He seemingly doesn’t find it at all amusing because his mouth is open before her bottom can even hit the chair, “Well, numbers don’t lie. Q2 was a masterpiece. Stark Industries leading in tech patents, defense contracts, and, let’s not forget, sheer charm. You’re welcome.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t stop her eyes from rolling if she tried. Her tone is dry, unamused, “Charm isn’t a quantifiable asset, Stark. And I wouldn’t call putting out half a dozen untested prototypes ‘leading.’”</p><p>“Oh, I’m sorry, Agatha. Do you not like innovation? You know, progress?”</p><p>“Stability wins markets, Stark,” Agatha says with her pen tapping against the wood grain, eyes unamused. “When your toys explode, my company’s stock rises. It’s almost… symbolic.”</p><p>His grin is wide, taunting. “So you admit you need me.”</p><p>“Like I need food poisoning.”</p><p>There’s a few dry chuckles and the uneasy air around them starts to dissipate until a voice not unfamiliar to Agatha though unfamiliar to these meetings draws everyone’s attention. “Well technically, Mr. Stark’s patents have driven discussions, which—<em>uh</em>, indirectly affects your company, Ms. Harkness, so in a way—”</p><p>“Miss Vidal. Were you asked to speak?”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks tinge pink, but her conviction never fades. “No. But the implications on cross-licensing are… kind of important?”</p><p>Tony couldn’t be more elated if he tried. “Finally, someone with taste. Keep talking, kid. What’s your name?”</p><p>Agatha finds she’s like to strangle Rio right here in front of everyone, but she’s not entirely convinced Tony hadn’t been pulling the strings since day one to get the woman to rile her up. </p><p>“Rio. I’m just an intern,” the young woman says, but Agatha can tell her chest swirled with pride upon being noticed. </p><p>“Emphasis on intern. Which usually means silent observation, not unsolicited… commentary,” Agatha says with wide eyes, her jaw set and her fingers nearly snapping the pen she’d been furious tapping the table with. </p><p>“Well, Rio. You’ve got more guts than half the execs in here. Don’t let Harkness scare you. She thrives on intimidation. Isn’t that right sweetheart?”</p><p>“<em>Oh, </em>Stark,” Agatha tsk’s her tongue. “You’re <em>really </em>on one today.”</p><p>“As opposed to all the other times?”</p><p>“Okay why don’t we pull in the reins you two,” the voice of another familiar face breaks through.</p><p>“Yes. Thank you, Hela,” Tony’s insufferable tone continues. “Let’s get down to business.”</p><p>Two hours later and the room has finally cleared out, save for Agatha and the remaining few heads that are filing in line to exit the room. Of course one of those heads is the head of raven hair that will haunt Agatha for every intern season to come. </p><p>“Miss Vidal,” her voice echoes before she can think better of it. When Rio turns to her with a blistering smile, Agatha thinks that maybe she should’ve just let her go. </p><p>“Yes, Ms. Harkness,” she says as innocently as she can muster.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t bite. “Do you make a habit of inserting yourself into conversations? Or was today a special occasion?”</p><p>“I didn’t think anything of it. Seriously,” Rio says earnestly though Agatha finds it extremely hard to believe. “Besides, I thought you would appreciate one of your interns speaking out. Does that not bode well for you? It shows you lead by a good example.”</p><p>Agatha wants to laugh, but Rio’s tone is more curious than accusatory, so she dials back the urge to strangle her and goes a much safer route.She stands from her chair, coming square to face Rio with a gentle tone and even gentler eyes. </p><p>“Interns speaking out without prior knowledge of my business ordeals is nothing but noise. And noise has no place in my boardroom.”</p><p>Rio swallows thickly and her eyes flicker down to Agatha’s lips for just a moment long enough for Agatha to notice. And then Rio’s smirking and Agatha realizes she’s opened a door to something she should’ve been prepared for, “Maybe not in your boardroom. But outside of it, I have a feeling you don’t mind a little noise.”</p><p>A beat passes between them and Agatha swears she goes through every single emotion at one. First surprise and then annoyance. But the last one will stick with her far longer than she’d like: desire. </p><p>When she speaks, her voice is cool  and calm despite the storm inside her. “Careful, Miss Vidal. Curiosity is one thing. Recklessness is another. And I have no tolerance for the latter.”</p><p>Rio smiles as she takes a few steps back. “Then I’ll make sure to be just reckless enough to keep your attention, Ms. Harkness."</p><p>And then she’s gone and Agatha is left alone, standing in the middle of the room amused despite herself. </p><p align="center">—</p><p>Agatha’s not hungry for lunch. She hasn’t moved from her office chair since she’d practically thrown herself in it just hours ago. She’s had a couple of phone calls sent to voicemail and there’s a meeting with two potential clients upcoming in the next thirty minutes that she’s been staring at for the last few minutes trying to make heads and tails of what she is going to say.</p><p>This isn’t like her. She is very rarely thrown off her game, but this internal crisis is becoming harder and harder to ignore. And in a split moment of brief clarity, she makes a declaration. She cannot, under any circumstances, entertain any more thoughts about the intern. She’d repressed these urges for twenty some years. She can most certainly do it for the next three months. In the same breath, she let herself admit that Rio is incredibly attractive and in another life, she’d have her smart mouth in check through a variety of creative ways. All of which required an enclosed space and a little excessive force.</p><p>But that isn’t this life. </p><p>In this life, she has a fiancé, Rio is her annoying intern and that is all that it can be.</p><p>When five pm rolls around, Agatha barely notices. The meeting with the clients went well. She’s hopeful she’ll hear back from them within the next few days and that keeps her head squarely on her shoulders. Wanda pokes her head in to say goodbye and it’s the first tether to reality Agatha’s had for the last few hours. </p><p>Knowing she’s not going to get any more work done for the day, she might as well leave. She grabs her belongings, slides her sunglasses into her hair like an impromptu headband and makes a b-line for the door. She flicks off the lights, pulls her key out of the lock and starts her journey home where a <em>long </em>bubble bath awaits.</p><p>But of course, God has favorites and Agatha is not one so Rio has magically spawned on her path to the elevator. The young woman has her back turned, bag thrown over her shoulder and her hair bow pinned up into a claw clip, but still, she’s unmistakable to Agatha. For a moment, she ponders hanging back, letting her get on the elevator and go about her merry way. Instead, she saddles up next to the young woman, who doesn’t budge from her presence in the slightest. She’s got her eyes trained down onto her phone, tongue poking against her cheek in concentration as she taps away a message. Agatha’s halfway to opening her mouth when Rio beats her to it, “I thought that was you coming. I heard you hesitate… figured I scared you away earlier.”</p><p><em>Fuck, </em>she’d been caught. </p><p>Agatha clears her throat, “Darling, It takes a lot more than that to scare me.”</p><p>Rio turns her head to face her and Agatha can see the way her ears tinge pink at the term of endearment. Agatha gets a first hand look at a different version of Rio—a softer one and her chest clenches at the sight. When Rio’s not a thorn in her side, she can be kind of endearing. </p><p>“I’m sorry if I came on a little too strong,” It’s said matter of factly, like there’s never been truer words to leave her mouth and Agatha swallows harshly under the note of vulnerability. “Some people,” Rio gestures to the few coworkers around them, “say I’m an acquired taste.”</p><p>Agatha raises an eyebrow, her mouth slotting open in mock surprise. “No, <em>you</em>?”</p><p>Rio snickers, her eyes falling to her feet.</p><p>“You know,” She hesitates for a moment before bringing her eyes back up to Agatha’s staggering blues. “I don’t think you’re like any one of these people either.”</p><p>The younger woman comments with her hand tightening around the leather strap of her bag as she yanks it softly in a gesture to the people around them—all with their backs turned.</p><p>“They’re all so…” She looks around to find the right word before she finally settles on one. “Boring.”</p><p>Agatha knits her eyebrows together. “Careful now, that sounded like a compliment.”</p><p>“Oh so, you weren’t flattered by being described as <em>in control. </em>No, instead you're worried about being disinteresting,” Rio teases, her body turning to face Agatha squarely. “I find that hard to believe.”</p><p><em>I think I’m worried about being disinteresting to </em>you<em>. </em></p><p>Now don’t get it wrong. The older woman is entirely uncomfortable with the rise that Rio seeks to get out of her. Every word. Every syllable is said with the intention of getting under some part of Agatha’s skin. She’s looking for something. Something that not even Agatha has found yet. But the sick truth is, she’s learning she doesn’t hate it. </p><p>She’d rather die than let Rio know that. Instead, she plays the long game and sets her sights on a prize of her own—finding out <em>why </em>Rio’s so curious to pick her a part. The best way to start is to turn the tables.</p><p>“What about you? You wouldn’t be worried about being found as boring,” Agatha asks, immediately noticing the way Rio’s eyes seem to pick up another glint to them. </p><p>“Do you? Find me boring, that is,” Rio asks with a noticeable drop to her voice.</p><p>Agatha is quick to respond, “Do you always answer questions with questions?”</p><p>Rio laughs, but it’s dry. “That’s quite literally what I’m going to be paid to do, Ms. Harkness.”</p><p>“Seems like an easy cop out to me, Ms. Vidal,” The CEO quips, her eyebrow raising in defiance. Rio doesn’t bite. She only snickers softly, her eyes finally diverting away from Agatha and to the floor as she scuffs her sneaker against the tile before she steps inches closer. Agatha watches the movement with a baited breath—scared to be caught off guard but even more frightened of what being in such close proximity to Rio will do to her. She’s been able to hold her composure thus far, but every minute that goes by is up to chance.</p><p>“No, I’m not worried about it… being boring,” she leans over towards her boss ever so slightly. The distance between them is closing by the minute. The elevator has long opened and closed, a new wave of employees surround them, but neither of them have noticed. Their minds are far too entranced by the other until Rio whispers against the thick tension between them. “I answered <em>yours.</em> Now answer <em>mine</em>. Am I boring to you?”</p><p>The older woman grits her teeth. A wave of irritation sinking into her chest. They way that Rio smirks towards her, noticing the small movement of her jaw tells Agatha she’s made a mistake. She tries to hide her scramble to sanity. “So demanding… You talk to all your superiors like that?”</p><p>She’s entirely too visible in front of the intern. Rio’s hit her intended mark. Gaining the upper hand feels like an impossible task. Rio is unrelenting and unguarded while Agatha is about as guarded as a maximum security prison. And still, somehow, Rio rises to the challenge.</p><p>“Only the ones that can take it,” Rio says with a <em>tsk </em>of her tongue.</p><p>“Darling, you have no idea what I can take,” Agatha scoffs, her feet carrying her towards Rio until there’s barely any room left between them. It’s the first time she’s let herself break. She tries not to think about how good it feels to finally let a piece of her react, but the dark look in Rio’s eyes and the smirk painted on her lips pulls a knot in her stomach. But it all falls to the wayside when reality comes crashing in. It’s like a bucket of cold water has been poured over her head, alighting all of her senses and reminding her that they are entirely exposed in the middle of the hallway, nearly nose to nose. </p><p>That bucket of cold water is her phone ringing. She checks her smart watch to see Ralph’s name lighting up the small screen and part of her is itching to hit the red <em>ignore </em>button in favor of finishing whatever this is with her intern. Before she can make the decision, it’s made for her when she sees Rio’s sneakers start to move underneath her wrist and when she looks up, she’s greeted with the back of the younger woman’s head. </p><p>Disappointment ripples through her bones. She thinks about calling after her, but decides better if it. She does follow Rio’s entire departure with her eyes until the intern enters the elevator and turns around to face Agatha one last time. The older woman’s breath catches when Rio winks at her just before the doors close.</p><p>Agatha misses Ralph’s phone call.</p><p>When she gets home that night, the deep echo of her purse dropping to the floor is a stark reminder of how alone she’s been feeling. She used to have a life she did more than just live—she experienced it. Her smiles hurt her face and she snorted when she laughed. Joy was something more than a feeling—it was a necessity. Now life had become just a series of days and months that moved her towards an unknown destination. Ralph is there. He always is, though he’s starting to feel like an obstacle. Her apartment suddenly feels too big. Her walls are too bare. </p><p>There should be more semblance of a life being lived.</p><p>But there’s a voice in the back of her head that says this is what she deserves. So she kicks off her heels and stalks towards her bedroom. The brown noise of Ralph in the kitchen drowns out when she starts to run herself a bath and when she sinks into the warm water, she lets herself exhale all the weight she’d been carrying.</p><p>She hasn’t brought a book or her phone, leaving her with her thoughts. All of which start to point to a certain brown eyed woman despite her promises to herself. The water gently laps against her neck, the steam heating up her cheeks and the smell of her lavender bath soak envelops her nostrils, but it’s not enough to keep Rio away. Agatha doesn’t fight the thoughts off. She lets them linger. </p><p>The sound of Rio’s low voice in the breakroom echoes through her brain. Her wink as she smirked at Agatha from the elevator. Her annoying low cutting button ups and dark beady eyes… Agatha thinks about sinking under the water, but instead, she lets her hand travel between her legs and ignores the feelings of shame threatening to slip through the cracks. </p><p>She thinks about Rio. She thinks about how many ways she can tear this woman apart until she no longer thinks she has any sort of grasp on Agatha. What it would’ve been like to pin her to her desk, that smug grin pressing down into the wood as Agatha let her hands roam against her ass cheeks. </p><p>But most importantly, she thinks about what Rio said to her. How confidently she <em>meant </em>what she said. That Agatha likes to be in control—to be on top. And of course Agatha does, though, she’s acutely aware that the ‘top’ Rio was referring to carried a much more vulgar inflection than she was prepared for, but she wouldn’t be wrong about that either. </p><p>She’s dated women before. She’s <em>slept </em>with women before. Prior to Ralph, she had <em>only </em>dated women. Throw in some internalized homophobia and catholic guilt and those desires got repressed so deeply that no one has ever come close to alighting them again. </p><p>Until <em>her. </em></p><p>Rio with her witty remarks and sly comeback. The way she talks with practiced ease. Not to mention, she’s incredibly attractive. Against all of her better judgments, Agatha thinks about Rio being pinned beneath her, sly smirk, filthy mouth and all. She thinks about what it would be like to ruin her; to have her writhing under her touch and <em>begging </em>for more. </p><p>She should feel guilty, but she doesn’t. Not at this moment. Not when the pull inside her stomach ruptures that stale bubble that has been sitting there for the entirety of her engagement to her less than lackluster fiancé. Of course he’s sweet and he means well, but Agatha can’t remember the last time she wanted sweet unless it was the taste of arousal coating her tongue. The brief memory of her wild and rowdy college days come to the forefront of her mind and if she momentarily wonders how Rio would taste, so <em>fucking </em>what. She’s only human and anyone with eyes could see that Rio Vidal oozes sex appeal like it’s in her very fucking bones. </p><p>For the first time in years, Agatha comes to the thought of a woman’s touch and the foundation beneath her cracks.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>It's barely eight thirty in the morning when Agatha is jamming her hand through the closing doors of the elevator, scrambling to get inside. Of course, the doors fling back open and thank god because the thought of having to stand and wait another minute feels like a battle she isn’t willing to take today. She hadn’t slept a wink the night prior. Although she’d denied herself her usual evening cup of coffee and tucked herself next to Ralph at about eleven the previous night, it just simply wasn’t enough to ease her mind.</p><p>She’d been with Ralph for twenty years—fifteen of them had been spent engaged and Agatha was faithful during every one of them. They were best friends first, only choosing to date after things had abruptly ended with Agatha’s ex girlfriend. </p><p>It wasn’t by choice. Not by a long shot, but with very little willpower, she’d found a place in Ralph. And after spending so long with someone, you just sort of become attached to them. You stay because that’s all you’ve ever known until one day you’re sitting at your table, should-be-husband across from you, and you realize that you’re forty three years old and this is going to be all you know for the rest of your life. </p><p>And that thought has started to make her sick. </p><p>Thanks to one intern sized problem with brown eyes and a smart mouth. So of course she didn’t sleep. Of course she thought of Rio, fighting off every single ounce of shame from her bath time activities from swallowing her whole. And of course she would choose the elevator the raven haired intern is occupying as well. When she spots those dark eyes through the opening of the door, there’s only a split second that passes where she isn’t considering waiting for the next one. Despite it, she steps inside–right in front of the smirking intern.</p><p>She hopes by some miracle, the woman picks up on her mood and chooses not to say anything, but like most things when it comes to Rio, it’s wishful thinking. She feels the young woman’s breath against the back of her neck before her low voice rings in her ears. Agatha shutters. Her cheeks heat up.</p><p>“You look like you could use a coffee,” are Rio’s choice of words. The way the hairs on her neck stand up at the feeling of warm breath hitting against her flesh isn’t entirely unwelcome. As embarrassing as that fact is to admit to herself, it’s not as embarrassing as Rio knowing that it affected her so deeply. Agatha hopes she played it off well enough. Rio doesn’t seem to notice as she continues, “Lucky for you I’ve got a coffee run on my schedule.”</p><p>Agatha turns to look over her shoulder and it’s definitely a mistake because their noses are nearly touching. She’s close enough to smell just how sweet and earthy the young woman’s perfume is. Rio’s tongue is poking against her cheek. She’s rocking back and forth on her heels with her hands shoved in her pockets, but it still makes Agatha’s breath catch in her throat.</p><p>She knows she should say no and stop entertaining whatever this is. She can go back to her normal, content life, right? </p><p><em> Wrong</em>. </p><p>“Two shots of espresso. Extra cream and cold foam please” is what Agatha says instead. And then the doors swing open to her floor and she’s got her feet in motion before she can even look back to see the smug grin being directed towards her. She does hear Rio’s response though. </p><p>“Sure thing boss.”</p><p>When Rio returns, she waits patiently outside of Agatha’s glass box before the CEO waves her inside with a flick of her wrist. The intern crosses the threshold to where her boss is sitting behind her desk, eyes buried in her laptop. When Agatha finally looks up to see Rio’s got two coffees in hand, one significantly taller than the other, it’s to her surprise that she’s handed the smaller one. She raises an eyebrow. </p><p>“What,” Rio asks, her shoulders shrugging. “You didn’t say what size.”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, grabbing the cup of coffee from Rio’s hand anyways. “I thought it would be a mutual understanding for it to be a bigger size. Not whatever sad excuse for a coffee this is.”</p><p>Rio eyes Agatha through narrow lids as she paints a smirk along her lips. “I guess it shouldn’t be a surprise that you’re a size queen.”</p><p>Agatha nearly crushes the cup in her hand. “<em>Excuse </em>me?”</p><p>“Oh,” comes Rio’s surprise. She stifles a laugh. “I didn’t think you’d get the meaning of that.”</p><p>“So you <em> did </em>mean it that way,” Agatha reaffirms, watching as Rio fights a grin of amusement off of her lips. She’s covering her smirk with her hands, stifling another laugh. Agatha almost wishes she had just let it go and played dumb because the younger woman is looking at her like she’s watching a grand plan fall into place, daring Agatha to challenge. </p><p>“That depends…” Rio finally pulls herself together. She clears her throat and takes a quick sip of her coffee, eyes locked onto Agatha’s. “Are you offended because I said it or because it’s true?”</p><p>Agatha tries to avoid the look of shock from spreading across her face, but even Rio knows it’s far too late to try to save. It’s her turn to clear her throat, it suddenly feels warm in here. Maybe she <em> should </em> invest in some curtains. And then some damn sage to keep this demon out of her office.</p><p>“I’m not sure what you’re implying, Miss Vidal. But I think,” Agatha pauses and Rio clings onto her every word like she might finally get what she wants. The CEO tries not to think about how good it feels to have the younger woman sitting on the palm of her hand like this. She almost lets it continue. <em> Almost. “</em>It would be in your best interest to get back to work. Thank you for the coffee.”</p><p>Rio almost looks disappointed, like some part of her thought she finally had Agatha right where she was trying to get her. But whatever look had crossed her face, it’s wiped quickly and replaced with a smile as she dips her head down into a nod. When the door shuts behind her, Agatha hates the silence that follows, but every time she takes a sip of her coffee she feels warm in more ways than one.</p><p>When Agatha gets to work the next morning, there’s a <em> large </em> white coffee cup on her desk. She’s leery about touching it at first, until she sees the name ‘<em>size queen’ </em> written in almost illegible script on the side. Of fucking course, Rio would do this. Agatha takes the cup to her lips and waits for the punch, but it never comes. The intern got her order right, down to the extra cream and cold foam. </p><p>
<em> Damn her. </em>
</p><p>That same thought crosses Agatha’s mind the very next day when she enters her office and not only is there a cup of coffee waiting for her, but Rio is attached to it this time. She’s standing next to the desk, coffee placed between her hands with a proud smirk gracing her lips. Agatha only stutters for a moment upon noticing the intrusion in her office. </p><p>“Who let you in here,” Agatha feigns indifference, marching past Rio as she slings her bag on to the wooden surface and pulls her sunglasses to the top of her head.  </p><p>Rio’s rolling her eyes as she sets the coffee down onto the desk anyways and then lowers her voice as if whispering, “Did you know your assistant <em> really </em>likes having her hair complimented?”</p><p>At this, Agatha pauses and practically gives herself whiplash with the amount of force she uses to turn her head towards Rio. “You did not flirt your way into my office by buttering up my assistant.”</p><p>“And if I did,” Rio says, daring Agatha to bite.</p><p>Even with the churning unease in her stomach at the thought of Rio flirting with Wanda, she smiles, “Then good for you. Perhaps you're close enough with her now to look over her resignation letter because I’ll be expecting it by the end of the week.”</p><p>Rio almost falters for a second, her eyes going wide, but she’s quick to recover. She bats her eyelashes, peering at Agatha from under her lids as she sweetens her voice. “<em>Awh</em>,<em> </em>don’t be jealous, sweetheart. I promise you it didn’t mean anything.”</p><p>Agatha swallows twice. Her breath shutters and then she’s grabbing the coffee on her desk to desperately give her mouth something to do because the noise that threatened to come out at the pet name would have never been recoverable. Rio knows. Of course she does. She can read Agatha like a book and she’s peering at the older woman with her big, doe, brown eyes like she knows the effect she causes.</p><p>When the CEO brings the cup from her lips, she looks down towards it in her hand and notices that, yet again, there’s something written on the side. Though this time it’s less vulgar, it’s not exactly a safer option either. </p><p>
<em> My secret work crush. </em>
</p><p>“Rio, how many people saw this before you got it to me,” her cheeks are burning. The completely audacity of this woman is undoing her completely and Agatha is fucking letting her like she isn’t engaged. It just—<em>fuck</em>, it feels too good. It feels right. </p><p>“I held my hand over it. I protect my sources,” she says with a wink and a click of her tongue before she starts back pedaling towards the door. Her eyes are bright, filled with glee at a battle she knows she’s winning.</p><p>Agatha tries to fight the smile off of her face, but she can’t. </p><p>The next day, there’s another coffee. </p><p>And the day after that.</p><p>And then the day after that. Each one with some variation of a nickname scribbled onto the side of the plastic in Rio’s signature chicken scratch. Sometimes Rio’s there. Sometimes she’s not. But it’s quickly becoming something Agatha looks forward to about her mornings. </p><p>She shouldn’t allow it. But she does. Because some deeply repressed part of her craves it and, well, she doesn’t want to fucking deny it anymore. It’s coffee and some mild flirting with an attractive woman who obviously finds her just as attractive. It’s harmless and no one has to know about this little work thing Agatha has. Ralph definitely doesn’t have to know. Not that he’d care anyways. He never asks about Agatha’s life and she doesn’t tell him about it. That doesn’t have to change. </p><p>So day after day and coffee after coffee, the weight gets a little lighter and her affinity for Rio unknowingly gets more dangerous. </p><p>Despite the warm gestures, it’s now nearly a week before she properly sees Rio again. Between business calls and executive meetings, Agatha has been squeezed tighter than two coats of paint. For the better part of three days, she has barely slept, only eaten about three salads and two grilled chicken breasts that were cold and gummy from the delivery driver taking their sweet time to find her office building. And throughout it all she has thought about Rio for most of the hours she’s not been hounded by documents of some sort. </p><p>She’d never admit it, but her days have been rather stale without the younger woman. That’s why when she runs into Rio, a habit she’s almost starting to <em> not </em>dislike, she’s almost excited to engage. But Rio doesn’t seem to have anything for her today besides a tight smile and a nod as they cross paths.</p><p>The CEO feels the disappointment wash over her like a wave. She ponders being the one to break the ice and take the charge, but that would give Rio too much pull. And Agatha can’t let that happen. </p><p>Instead, she finds herself, almost pathetically, finding another way to run into Rio. She could just approach her, make up some excuse for an impromptu meeting, but that would be too easy—too desperate. She thought about writing a note, something like, ‘<em>thanks for the coffees’ </em>but even that feels too juvenile. </p><p>She’ll just have to be patient. It’s a virtue after all.</p><p>She did end up hearing back from the clients she’d met with last week and they’d decided to move their company under her supervision. With that comes many, <em> many </em>financial reviews and preparations for new ownership so she spends majority of her time delegating tasks to her staff and familiarizing herself with the ins and outs of the new branch. </p><p>She starts to feel more like herself. Work has always been her saving grace—something she can lose herself in when things become overwhelming. She’s good at being in control, commanding her space. If she has nothing else, she always has this.</p><p>She buries herself in it. Using every bit of fractured self doubt that Rio has left behind to fuel her work ethic. New bodies come in and out of her doors, she’s in and out of multiple Zoom conversations and she only forgets to eat twice. But finally, there’s a sense of normalcy lingering.</p><p>Wanda tries her best to keep her on some sort of dignified schedule, but chaos always works its way into Agatha's routine whether her assistant time blocks for it or not. So, after a few too many choice words from her boss about interruptions, she stepped aside and let things be. That being said, Agatha has become so out of touch with anything that isn’t currently scattered across her desk that Wanda fights off all of her anxieties and decides to step in for a status update. </p><p>“Ms. Harkness,” she says with a hint of worry in her tone as she enters the space. Agatha turns her head to the sound, looking over the brim of her glasses as she fiddles them with her fingers and pulls them up onto the top of her head. </p><p>She picks up on Wanda’s apprehension immediately and lucky for the redhead, she hadn’t been busy with anything important. So,  Agatha softens her voice when she speaks, “Oh hey Wanda. Is everything okay?”</p><p>“Yes, I just wanted to check in with you and see if you needed anything from me,” Wanda smiles, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear nervously.</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, “I’m all good, hon. Thank you for checking. I’ve got a few more zooms and some files to read over and then I’m going to step out for a bit. I’ll swing by your desk before I leave to let you know.”</p><p>“Everything okay,” Wanda asks.</p><p>“Yes, I just need to pick up something,” Agatha answers honestly.</p><p>“Is it your outfit for the dinner this weekend,” Wanda says and Agatha swears she can feel the color drain from her face. “I’m looking forward to seeing what you’re going to wear.”</p><p>“Oh <em> fuck,</em>” she curses, head falling into her hands. “Remind me again.”</p><p>Wanda swallows, mutters something about a calendar and Agatha pretends not to hear for the sake of her sanity. </p><p>“It’s the intern dinner,” her assistant responds and Agatha wants to curse again for ever suggesting to have such a thing. She’d imagined herself in her office this weekend nursing a glass or bottle of wine and listening to something soft while she drank away her shitty week. </p><p>She sighs. “Thank you, Wanda. I’ll get that squared away today.”</p><p>Agatha’s a busy woman. She doesn’t have time to parade around the city in search of the perfect dress for a dinner that doesn’t rank too highly on the importance scale. However, getting a rise out of Rio does. So after she exits work for the day, she has Christian, take her to her favorite boutique. She’d called the owner ahead of time, Jen, her long time friend and former college roommate and gave her the low down of what she was looking for so as to save time.</p><p>The instructions were simple. Something sleek, sexy and tastefully revealing. It’s a corporate event after all. On a whim, she’d decided the dress code would be black tie, so the color of choice had to be dark. She’d given that liberty to Jen to decide. </p><p>Upon arriving at the store, Jen is already waiting for her just inside the entrance and immediately welcomes her with a familiar smile. “Agatha! Long time no see!”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes affectionately, a brisk wave of her hand in dismissal. “Oh please Jennifer. You act like we don’t talk on the phone weekly.”</p><p>“You mean <em> I </em>talk, while you pretend to care what I’m saying,” Jen quips, her arms crossing across her chest. She’s wearing a floor length pink dress and by all accounts, it looks stunning on her. Agatha questions a lot of things about Jen, but not her taste in fashion. She knows what she's doing in that regard. They just have a few color palette differences to work through. </p><p>“Yeah, yeah,” Agatha says dismissively. “Now where is the magic you worked for me?”</p><p>Jen huffs out a sigh. “You know I wouldn’t scramble like this for just anyone? Two hours isn’t exactly the best notice to find a winner.”</p><p>“But I trust that you did?”</p><p>Jen chuckles, “Of course. I’m amazing.”</p><p>She turns around in a quick twirl and beckons Agatha to follow, which the older woman does with a defeated sigh. However, her sour mood quickly changes when she sees what Jen has laid out before her. It’s only one option meaning Jen is more than confident that this is the <em> one. </em>And from what Agatha can see of it, she has to agree. It’s black with a silky smooth texture and straps so thin, you’d barely notice they are there behind her messy mane of hair. The neckline dips seamlessly into dangerous territory without giving too much away. She’s itching to see herself in it.</p><p>Jen picks it up and hands it off to the older woman eagerly, her eyes shining brightly as she urges “Go” and nods towards the dressing rooms and Agatha is quick to follow. </p><p>From the moment she slides the dress onto her body, she feels it. The confidence enveloping her like a second skin. It was stunning on the rack, but on her body? Oh Rio is going to melt. It’s a classy floor length, with a <em> fucking </em>leg slit revealing her silky smooth left leg like dangling forbidden fruit. The neckline dips to the middle of her chest, the insides of the swell of her breasts just barely visible against the fabric. It hugs to her figure almost too perfectly. She can’t remember the last time she felt this sexy. </p><p>“What do you think,” Jen’s voice filters through the closed curtain of the dressing room.</p><p>Agatha bites back a grin even though her best friend isn’t able to see it. “<em>Eh, </em>It’ll do.”</p><p>”You're welcome, <em>Asshole</em>.”</p><p>When Agatha gets home, Ralph sees her new purchase, but he doesn’t ask any questions. Agatha doesn’t find that she wanted him too. Part of her wants to save this dress for Rio’s eyes only and maybe that makes her sick in the head. </p><p>But she’s never claimed to be right minded anyways. </p><p>The next day, Agatha Harkness arrives at her office just like every other morning, prepared to hit the ground running. Her heels click against the polished floor as she strides to her desk, ready for a full day of meetings.</p><p>But then, she stops.</p><p>There’s no coffee.</p><p>Every single morning since Rio’s arrival into her life, there has been a coffee. </p><p>She blinks once, twice, just to make sure her eyes aren't playing tricks on her. No coffee cup sitting on the edge of her desk. </p><p>Her mind races. <em> Where’s Rio? </em> She checks the clock. It’s still early.</p><p>A flare of irritation ignites within her. Rio had been bringing her coffee every morning without fail. It had become their ritual, their unspoken connection. Every day, Rio would show up at exactly the right time, hands outstretched with the cup that kept Agatha focused. <em> It wasn’t much</em>, but it was theirs.</p><p>And now Rio isn’t here and Agatha doesn’t know what to do with herself. There’s nothing for her to sip on to help calm her nerves and she does not have the right to call the intern despite knowing she could get away with it if she played her cards right.</p><p>But she catches herself and has to ask why she cares so deeply. Rio could be playing hooky. She could be sick. She just could be running late. Whatever the reason though, Agatha finds she wants to be the one to know. However big or small.</p><p>She can’t sit at her desk and focus while her thoughts hang up in the air. On a whim, she decides to take a stroll through the intern bull pen. Maybe she’ll find Rio there and it’ll just be a silly mistake the intern made. Even though the thought of having Rio forget about her or decide she wasn’t important enough isn’t her favorite reason, she’d rather have that explanation than none at all.</p><p>Her heels click through the halls as she turns to make a quick pass through where Rio’s desk should be, she finds it empty. Her chair is still pushed in and her monitor is shut off. There’s no sign of Rio and therefore no sign of Agatha’s anxiety easing up. </p><p>To avoid suspicion, she continues walking around the intern desks and she finds that most of them are quietly at work, but there’s a group that’s formed around one cubicle and most of their backs are turned towards the CEO. They don’t know she’s there so their voices are loud and abrasive enough for her to hear them as well. She wasn’t going to eavesdrop, but then she hears Rio’s name and like a siren, she’s alerted. </p><p>“Yeah, Rio was <em>fucking</em> plastered dude,” one of the guys chuckles as a few laughs follow. “I’m not surprised she’s not here. I’m sure she hasn’t even woken up yet.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrow quirks as she crosses her arms and upturns her ear to hear a little better.</p><p>“She has to be awake, she took that girl home… What's her name? The blonde one?”</p><p>Whatever is said next falls on deaf ears. Agatha jaw tightens, her nails dig into her biceps as she breathes a deep breath through her nose as if to calm herself from the information she just heard. </p><p>How dare Rio be so fucking careless?  It’s a weekday for crying out loud. She’s got one of the most prestigious internships in the god damn continental United States and she’s pissing it away over calling out of work because she got <em> fucking </em> drunk and probably stayed awake all night <em> entertaining </em> some girl she’ll never see again. What the <em> fuck </em> is she thinking?</p><p>Agatha had planned on approaching the group, but her mind is otherwise occupied as she walks herself back into her office with heavy strides and her teeth chewing into her bottom lip almost painfully. She’d planned on throwing herself into her work. Maybe throw in her airpods and find the best rock playlist in her phone to keep her from strangling Rio the next time she saw her.</p><p>She just hadn’t planned for that moment to be right now as the raven haired girl is standing in her office, coffee in hand like she didn’t just miss nearly an hour of her shift—like she didn’t do what Agatha just heard.</p><p>“Good morning Ms. Harkness,” Rio’s voice chirps, but it doesn’t land the same. Agatha can’t even look at her. She avoids her eyes completely as she steps around her to take a seat behind her desk. She can’t even believe how Rio would knowingly risk her position like this. After everything Agatha has let her get away with, she does this?</p><p>“You’re late,” Agatha nearly barks. </p><p>Rio blinks, thrown but not deterred. “Technically, yes. But only a little. And see? Coffee, just the way you—” </p><p>“You can leave it there. I’ll get it.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t look up to see Rio’s frown. She doesn’t see the way the younger woman’s breath stutters and she stumbles on her feet a bit. </p><p>“Everything okay?”</p><p>Agatha looks up to her for the first time this entire interaction and is surprised to find that when she looks at the younger woman, the anger that flares in her chest is almost unbearable.</p><p>“Just peachy,” the CEO snarks, grabbing the coffee and pulling it up to her lips. When she takes a sip, she grimaces. “It’s cold.”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks turn pink but her jaw is set. “Is it? Well… I thought maybe you’d prefer something a little cooler today. Matches your demeanor.”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, but doesn’t bite. She can’t bite. Because if she does, she won’t be able to stop and then whatever good thing this is will get thrown right in the trash just like everything else she’d ever enjoyed in her life. </p><p>“Are you seriously giving me the silent treatment,” Rio says, her voice raising incredulously.</p><p>“I’m not sure where you got the idea I owe you anything at all, Miss Vidal.”</p><p>“Well I just thought that maybe—”</p><p>Her eyes are fixed on Rio, unblinking. “I don’t tolerate excuses. Or unprofessional behavior.”</p><p>Rio tilts her head, lips curling. “<em>Unprofessional</em>? All this fuss over thirty minutes?”</p><p>Agatha leans forward, her tone low, dangerous. “I hear you were <em> occupied </em> last night. That you couldn’t be bothered to prepare yourself for work this morning. Is that what you think of this internship? Have I gotten too comfortable to let you think you can get away with things like this?”</p><p>For the first time, Rio falters fully. Then she laughs, a soft, incredulous sound, “Is that what this is about? Who told you that?”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightens. “Does it matter?”</p><p>Rio steps closer to the desk, her grin slow and teasing, though her eyes shine with mischief. “You’re jealous. That’s it, <em> isn’t it? </em> You think I’d rather spend my nights with someone else than be bright-eyed and ready to bring you coffee.”</p><p>Agatha goes stiff, her jaw nearly locking into place with how fast she set it. “Do <em> not </em>flatter yourself. I expect professionalism, not excuses.”</p><p>Rio studies her for a long moment, her smirk softening into something more dangerous, more sincere. She slid the cup a little closer to Agatha’s hand and straightened her posture. With a smile she quietly whispers, eyes never leaving Agatha’s, “You don’t have to worry about me being distracted. I only have eyes for one person here.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightens. She forces her gaze back to the papers on her desk, feigning indifference. “Get back to work, Miss Vidal.”</p><p>But she didn’t reach for the coffee again until Rio was gone.</p><p align="center">—</p><p>There’s a meeting for the inner building staff, including interns, in the boardroom. It’s a quick check in, nothing outstanding and definitely nothing that warrants Rio to be so transfixed on Agatha to the point that the CEO finds it hard to remember her perfectly curated words. It’s like she’s daring Agatha to bite. Having indirectly laid her feelings bare just a few days ago, things haven’t been the same between the two of them. There’s been coffee on her desk, but it’s only adorned with her name now and Rio is hardly ever the one to deliver it.</p><p>Agatha had reflected on that situation a lot and how she’d so clearly been jealous, but unable to see it for the way she is too afraid to admit to herself the truth… she likes Rio. </p><p>The intern is attractive and cunning. She’s one hundred percent smart ass, but it’s charming in the way the conversation is never boring. Agatha is never bored of Rio. She’s also sneakily sweet by remembering Agatha’s coffee order and choosing to bring it to her daily without so much as one complaint. She’s driven and wild at the same time, always keeping those around her on their toes. </p><p>Agatha can’t remember the last time someone has ever made her feel the way Rio does. </p><p>She can’t remember the last time Ralph made her feel that way. </p><p>She sensed it coming… the end, but finding the way to say it seemed far too time consuming. She’d needed more time to make things easy. But for now, she’s got to dial things back just enough to clear her head. Rio had pulled back her flirting, so it is mainly on Agatha to figure out the rest. </p><p>But now, she’s leading a meeting with her staff and the only thing she can look at is one raven haired woman in the midst of the crowd. Every word she says, it’s like Rio claims it. It’s how she bites the tip of her pin with her teeth, showing off her little gap in the middle of her two fronts while she tilts her head just enough to the side. It’s entirely too distracting and a severe thorn in Agatha’s side, but <em> fuck </em>does it hit right on Rio’s intended target. And she knows it too. With her sly grin and smug smiles. </p><p>The older woman is halfway through explaining upcoming events and she feels like the end can’t come soon enough. If she has to endure one more second of the burn across her body from the woman’s eyes alone, she might combust on the spot. She tries her hardest to look at anyone, everyone, the ceiling, the board, absolutely anything. But for some godforsaken reason, she’s drawn to Rio like a moth to light. Rio clings to every word she says, nodding her head in approval like she’s not antagonizing her boss to near dysfunction. Worst of all, Agatha feels her body get the best of her. A woman can only be looked at like that for so long before it’s got to be handled. </p><p>Agatha can think of a few ways she’d like to handle Rio. </p><p>The build up of undeniable tension has led to this very moment and Agatha can’t find a reason to deny it anymore. She said she’d wait, but fuck it. The end of her and Ralph is inevitable. What she does up until that point is no one’s business but her own. It won’t even matter in the grand scheme of things. From the moment Rio had believed she’d had the upper hand, Agatha had wanted to <em> take. </em>Take away her false sense of power by fucking her into next Tuesday. She’d never wanted to admit that to herself.. Not until this very moment where her last thread of patience has snapped and desire has started to take precedence at a rate she hasn’t felt since those fated college days. </p><p>When she finally delivers her closing statement—by extending the invitation for the welcome dinner to the interns and vehemently reminding them that the dress code is black tie and they were all expected to arrive in such, she breathes a sigh of relief. </p><p>As the interns start to exit the room, Agatha calls for Rio to stay back and it doesn’t go unnoticed by either woman that this is the first time the CEO has initiated any sort of meeting between the two of them. Agatha honestly hadn’t had any control over it. It’s like a speeding car barreling down the highway into a dead end—the crash is inevitable and they both know it.</p><p>Agatha hasn’t figured out if giving in makes her stronger or weaker. Rio doesn’t look like she cares either way. </p><p>“Is this my personal invite to the dinner Ms. Harkness,” Rio toys, resting her elbows on the table in front of her and leaning into her hands with her chin. She stares up at Agatha with a coy, sly smile. “If so, I humbly accept.”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, slowly stalking over to rest her hands on the table adjacent to Rio, leaning down into the intern’s personal space. The way that Rio’s eyes drop to her chest for a moment sends a spark of adrenaline through the older woman’s body with a stark reminder that Agatha could very quickly have the upper hand here if she just let her body work for her. It’s no secret it affects the younger woman.</p><p>“Miss. Vidal,” Agatha starts, her tone much lower and raspier than normal. Maybe it’s from the near twenty minute speech she just made that makes her feel like talking is a big challenge right now or maybe it’s the way she’s just been eye fucked for the last thirty minutes. Both women know it’s not the latter. “Can you tell me at least one thing you took away from that meeting?”</p><p>Rio pauses as if to run the thought through her head. Agatha watches her through a fixed gaze, trying hard not to lean just a little further across the table. Something about close proximity to the woman just draws her in like a magnet. </p><p>“Well,” Rio starts. “You look rather sexy commanding a room.” </p><p>It’s the boldest statement Rio has made thus far and Agatha wants so desperately to roll her eyes, but annoyance isn’t the route she wants to take here. Not when her underwear is already embarrassingly soaked through and she feels like she might pass out if she doesn’t put Rio in her rightful place.</p><p>Agatha licks her lips, well aware of the way Rio mirrors the action. They're close. They haven’t been this close since their coffee conversation in the break room last week. The CEO is devastatingly aware of how dangerous this feels but damn does it finally feel good to lean into it just a bit. </p><p>“You don’t hide your intentions very well. I could tell you wanted me to bend you over this desk the moment I started talking.”</p><p>She shouldn’t have said it. God, she really shouldn’t have. But the way Rio’s demeanor drops ever so slightly makes her lips turn into a devious smirk. It’s the first time she’s seemingly broken into Rio’s confident exterior. Agatha doesn’t want to recognize how good it feels because it’s dangerous territory for her. She might not ever stop doing this. </p><p>Rio swallows thickly before she speaks, “How’s that for an HR violation?”</p><p>Of course it’s a witty remark. Classic deflection on Rio’s part. </p><p>“You didn’t deny it,” Agatha comments to which Rio’s eyes widen. She’s clearly surprised the older woman isn’t letting up. </p><p>“You’re right… I didn’t,” Rio affirms, leaning back in her chair to fold her arms across her chest. Agatha hates the distance, but downright loves the chase. “So what are you going to do about that?” </p><p>Agatha leans just a little further into her resting Arms, knocking her voice down a few octaves as she prepares herself to say the words that will push them over that goddamn line she must have drawn with a fucking dry erase marker. She licks her lips. </p><p>“I'm going to make you beg for it.” </p><p>The barely audible whimper that leaves Rio’s mouth is the final nail in the coffin for Agatha. She could say more, she certainly wants to, but something about leaving on that note after winding the younger woman up tightly makes her feel proud. They’re on even ground now—both turned on beyond comprehension and too in their own heads to do anything about it. Agatha pushes herself back up off the table to stand back on her heels, turning to the door for her exit.</p><p>Rio sits dumbfounded, blinking her eyes back into focus. Agatha chuckles softly, turning her back to her perfectly curated mess as she goes to open the door. She’s surprised when she’s sharply turned around at the hip and thrust up against the back of said door. Rio’s directly on her, one hand pinned to the door above Agatha’s head and the other resting on her hip. When she’s this close, Agatha can see just how dark her eyes are, how much they are filled with want. </p><p>“That was cruel,” Rio says through gritted teeth. </p><p>Agatha regains her sense of self. “No what’s cruel is you antagonizing me for weeks. Getting in my head, under my skin. Getting off on it… and then when you piss me off, you go running away. I’m a lot of things, but I’m not dumb.”</p><p>She feels Rio’s nails dig into her hip and the pain stings oh so good. The shot of arousal that comes through her awakes something that had been deeply repressed. </p><p>“But don’t worry darling, I won’t hold it against you but so much,” Agatha continues, eyes flickering down to Rio’s full lips that are just so close—close enough that Agatha can notice the teeth marks on her bottom lip from how hard she’d been biting at herself in restraint. The younger woman notices the action and she starts to move too close in the gap when Agatha feels things get a little too real, but to her surprise, she can’t find a reason to stop. “Because this is what you wanted isn’t it? You wanted me to take control? Put you in your place?”</p><p>Agatha swears she hears Rio whimper, but the younger woman recovers herself quickly.</p><p>“Is that what you think,” Rio breathes against her lips. “You think I don’t know that you think about this too?”</p><p>Agatha goes to laugh, but the sound gets caught in her throat as Rio leans into the side of her face, whispering into her ear, “That you want to <em> ruin </em> me just as much as I want you to?”</p><p>Agatha closes her eyes and relishes in the way Rio’s words alight her skin. They envelop her in arousal almost completely. The same way Rio herself has since she entered her office just last week. As the younger woman’s lips start to dip towards the skin of her neck, she feels her heart rate quicken. This is where she gives in. This is where she goes beyond the point of return. This is where—</p><p>“<em>Ow—” </em> Rio exclaims as her nose collides into Agatha’s neck much faster than she definitely intended. It takes her second to realize the door behind them was thrown open and sent Agatha flying into Rio very, very abruptly. She’s nursing her nose in her hand when an intern comes in to pick up his notebook he’d left behind. He’s too afraid to look over at the CEO, which happily works in their favor. It wouldn’t take a rocket scientist to realize what had just happened. </p><p>Agatha clears her throat and smooths her hands against the front of her dress in an effort to make herself look put together again which is in stark contrast to the way she feels internally. Reality snaps back at her like a rubber band and she’s feeling entirely too sobered up by the realization that she let herself get carried away. Things like that can’t happen. She’s too prideful of a person to let a chase go. Once she’s started, she’s got to finish in more ways than one. And with Rio, she knows there’s a dangerous edge she’s teetering.</p><p>Agatha looks up to find Rio staring at her, obviously wondering if things would pick up where they left off, but Agatha’s decided to accept the sign from the universe and not keep this going in the board room of her office building. </p><p>So throwing her hair over her shoulder with a dramatic flip, she smiles as she says, “See you Saturday.”</p><p>And then she leaves and takes her last remaining shred of dignity, that is barely hanging on, with her. </p><p align="center">—</p><p>The dinner is at a 4 star restaurant in the West Village that serves perfectly curated lobster risotto with their in-house red wine that Agatha dreams about every single night she closes her eyes. She could’ve gone much cheaper for the young interns who would—no doubt—be entirely okay with a greasy burger and some fries, but she’s nothing if not a statement-making woman. If they take nothing else from this internship aside from the dish they eat at this restaurant, she’d go as far to consider that a success. </p><p>And like all choices Agatha has made and continues to make in her life, black tie was indeed the right one. Firstly, in regards to herself, she <em> feels </em>sexy. Secondly, Rio had chosen to come in quite a similar get up and if Agatha thought Rio in a suit was attractive, Rio in a black dress is downright sinful. Her hair is knotted up into a refined bun, exposing her neckline in all its glory. It surprised Agatha that Rio had chosen a high, rounded neckline on her dress. She’d expected it to be a lot more risqué with the way the younger woman tended to present herself. </p><p>But when the younger woman turns around to greet someone, Agatha knows immediately to never, ever, second guess Rio Vidal again. The dress is backless, which is already enough to make Agatha crumble at the knees, but it’s surprisingly not the expansive skin on display that makes her mouth go dry. It’s the delicate ink covering her spine. Rio has a spine tattoo. A dagger spine tattoo. And dear fucking god Agatha’s fingertips are burning to touch.</p><p>She’s not sure what possesses her. Maybe it’s the second glass of wine she’s nursing. Maybe it’s the pure lust running through her veins like some touch starved fein. Whatever it is, it moves her feet right over to Rio’s side and causes her to intentionally place her hand on the small of Rio’s back. She doesn’t have to look over at the younger woman to feel the smirk that is being sent her way. Oh how she’d love to wipe it off. </p><p>“Hello,” she greets the small gathering of people. “How is everyone tonight?”</p><p>“Excited to be here, Ms. Harkness,” Matthew says with a tight smile. Despite his eyes being covered, she can still see that he’s being genuine. Agatha remembers his interview as a standout as well. She can smell catholic guilt from a mile away and just knows he’s going to be an absolute menacing asset to whatever firm he luckily ends up at. </p><p>“I’m excited to have you all here,” Agatha returns the sentiment, tapping Rio on the small of her back in affirmation, but then disappointingly lets her hand fall back down by her side in restraint. “Sit wherever you like and feel free to order drinks. It’s an open tab. My treat for all that you do.”</p><p>She leaves them to talk after that, proud of the way she made her statement to Rio without losing herself in the way the woman’s bare skin felt against her hand. All she wanted to say was, <em> I see this. It’s hot. </em>And move on. She thinks the message was delivered. If she sees Rio’s eyes following her as she walks away, she pretends not to notice. </p><p>Dinner starts off with a welcome speech. This time she doesn’t look at Rio because she’s learned her lesson, but also because she’s still thinking about what Rio would look like bent over a desk for her. And now with the added knowledge of the back tattoo, she fears she might not make it through the speech alive. So yes, she will be looking anywhere but Rio.</p><p>She makes it through successfully by ending her speech with a toast. Everyone cheers along and she feels a smile tug on her lips. Now that she’s in a safe zone, she looks to the raven haired woman just a few seats down from her. She’s as stunning as ever. Makeup still expertly done and lips painted a gorgeous deep red. Her side profile is an absolute painting that Agatha is trying to commit to memory. She isn’t ashamed that she watches Rio over the rim of her wine glass for most of the dinner. The way she laughs. Talks. Listens. Everything is so damn sexy it makes Agatha’s stomach hurt. </p><p>She stands to make a quick escape to the bathroom to relieve her bladder, but mostly of the ugly pining she was just doing so openly in front of everyone. Wow, she needs to get a grip.  </p><p>As she’s washing her hands, the bathroom door opens behind her and the woman she’s got ingrained into her brain appears behind her and for the first time since their last meeting, they are alone. Agatha looks at her through the mirror and watches the way Rio doesn’t have to even open her mouth to say what she’s thinking. Their eyes are locked. Both of them daring the other to breathe first—move first. Agatha grips the sides of the sink a little tighter and sets her jaw. Rio’s poking her tongue against her cheek, arms crossed against her chest like she herself is daring Agatha to do something about it. </p><p>Rio opens her mouth to speak, “See something you like?”</p><p>Agatha feels her mouth go dry. She sees a lot she likes. There isn’t anything she <em> doesn’t </em>like. Rio is divine. In every sense of the word. Her body thrums with warmth from the alcohol and the desire coursing through her veins. It’s frozen her in place, unable to move away from her position out of the fear of breaking the moment. Rio doesn’t share the same thought because she begins to step close, her heels clicking with each stride. She ends up directly behind Agatha, peering over her back and directly into her eyes. </p><p>“I, for one, see a lot that I like,” Rio comments lowly, her eyes raking down Agatha’s backside before they reluctantly meet her eyes again. “Remember when you said you’d make me beg for it?”</p><p>Agatha raises an eyebrow and finally finds her voice, though it’s entirely too raspy to be perceived as unaffected. “Is this you begging?”</p><p>Rio laughs, but her eyes darken. “Do you need me to get on my knees to seal it?”</p><p>Agatha feels her body shutter as she finally turns around to face the woman. Rio steps into her personal space almost immediately and Agatha fights everything within herself not to give in. Not here. </p><p>“I will, Ms. Harkness,” Rio says coyly, her body moving into Agatha like a magnet. “Because I <em> want </em>you… So badly.” </p><p>A guttural groan escapes her throat before she gives in to every single urge that’s been sitting in her body since this woman walked into her office nearly a month ago. Her hands outstretch between them, palms falling flat against the sides of Rio’s face as she pulls the woman’s lips towards hers forcefully. They collide with such intensity, Agatha swears she tastes blood. She can’t bring herself to care.</p><p>Not when her lips slot against Rio’s like they’ve never had any other purpose in life. She tastes like tart wine and it's intoxicating in its own right. Agatha is starting to get dizzy. Momentarily forgetting how to breathe. Her stomach is swirling into a tight coil of pressure and her body suddenly feels like it's coursing with molten hot lava. Desire, <em> lust. </em>It’s painstakingly obvious.</p><p>She feels eighteen again. Like she’s back in college and finally kissing a girl for the first time and wondering why she’d waited so long to do it. These last couple of days have led to this moment where she finally feels like something makes sense again. </p><p>Rio’s hands find Agatha's forearms in a tight grip as she pulls the older woman tighter to her. Agatha feels emboldened under her touch. Her skin is alighting with goosebumps. She wants to let herself melt and succumb to the feeling of being reduced to a puddle at the younger woman’s feet, but the action never comes. </p><p>Because Rio slips her tongue against the CEO’s bottom lip before she pulls it into her mouth with a soft suck and suddenly the only thing the older woman can think about is how can she devour this woman whole? She’s groaning at the feeling unabashedly though Agatha isn’t sure who moans louder, but both sounds only serve to push her further into a frenzy. </p><p>She’s hyper aware of the distance between them—what little there was and can’t help but revel in the way Rio works. Her every move is purposeful and deliberate. She’s mastering the ticks that check every single box on the ‘<em>how can I drive Agatha wild’ </em> checklist. </p><p>It’s maddening—the way Rio just understands.</p><p>Agatha pushes against her lips harder, using the leverage to switch their positions and send Rio backpedaling towards the sink in just a few steps. It’s a little clumsy and desperate and completely in tune with the current moment. When she feels Rio’s back hit against the edge, she’s sliding her hands down against the younger woman’s thighs and lifting her up onto the counter with one smooth motion. </p><p>She’s not sure what’s overcome her—the urge to take control, because it’s been entirely too long since she’s had a moment like this, but Rio doesn’t seem to be raising any concerns. Agatha’s not either.</p><p>Their lips disconnect for a split moment as Rio steadies herself into her new position, but it’s entirely too long as Agatha is already searching for another spot to latch her lips onto. She finds the inner junction of Rio’s neck and sucks softly at the warm, salty skin there. The way Rio’s hands thread through her hair softly and delicately as if she’d been worried any sudden movement would cause this moment to end makes Agatha want to push into it harder—prodding Rio to stake her claim. She doesn’t though. Instead, she continues her onslaught of sloppy, wet kisses and relishes in the way this angle lets Rio’s soft pants funnel right into her ear. </p><p>She kisses her way back up Rio’s jaw, a line of saliva following in her wake until her breath is hot against Rio’s kiss swollen lips. </p><p>“You have a <em> fucking </em> back tattoo,” Agatha groans, eyes finding Rio’s in a moment of clarity. She swears their impossibly darker, her pupils dilated beyond reason. She almost feels proud. “That’s so <em> fucking </em> hot.” </p><p>Rio whimpers, her body jutting forward desperately as she pulls Agatha’s lips back onto hers. “You’re <em> fucking </em> hot.”</p><p>Agatha returns the whimper. If she wasn’t running on pure adrenaline and the sole thought of getting a better, more top down view of Rio’s bareback, she wouldn’t have been able to muster up the courage to talk either. Her chest is heaving in rigid motions, her heart is pounding in her ears and Rio’s nails are leaving small crescent shapes in her back, but she still can’t get enough. The wetness between her thighs is pooling to the point she can feel it sliding against her thighs, underwear ruined and beyond saving. She lets herself imagine Rio pulling them off and discarding them somewhere to be found much later on by someone that isn’t either of them—treating them like the useless thing they are. </p><p>Oh how sweet it would be. </p><p>Agatha starts to worry she’ll never be able to live a normal life after this. That this ache will always linger, never satisfied. That some part of her has just been ripped open and released to the masses—a part of her she hadn’t realized she’d been repressing. </p><p>It isn’t until a clattering of dishes outside the door echoes through the room that they finally pull back from each other. Chests heaving. Lips swollen and covered in smeared lipstick. Hair disheveled. Eyes as dark as night. Even like this, Agatha still thinks that this Rio is the sexiest she’s ever seen and she finds herself willing to risk it all. Right here in this public restroom with her entire intern staff within earshot. </p><p>“Is this the part where I say we should get back to dinner,” Rio says breathlessly, her hand coming up to her lips to wipe off the now ruined lipstick. </p><p>Agatha nods, but her eyes have disassociated completely as if she’s got a million thoughts behind them. (She does and all one million involve Rio).</p><p>“Okay then,” Rio says, but makes no move to get off the counter. When Agatha stares at her curiously, she laughs. “I’m not exactly stable right now. I’m scared my legs are going to give out when I get off.”</p><p>“Okay so are you just gonna, like… stay there,” Agatha asks to which Rio nods.</p><p>“Yeah just for a second though. You go first. I’ll stay back and get myself together.” </p><p>Agatha nods again, her mouth unable to make any other sounds that aren’t obscene right now. She clears her throat, runs a hand through her hair and gives herself once over in the mirror behind Rio. </p><p>“Black looks good on you,” is what Rio offers and its exactly what Agatha needed to hear to break any spell she was currently still under. </p><p>“Oh <em> honey, </em>everything looks good on me.” </p><p>And then she leaves the bathroom and tries to regain any sense of normalcy for the rest of the dinner like she wasn’t just tonguing down one of her interns in a public bathroom. How’s that for Agatha’s bingo card? </p><p>When Rio returns from the bathroom, Agatha laughs to herself because of course both of them look like a hot mess express that barreled through the station at mach twenty. When they make eye contact, Rio winks and it’s like everything and nothing has changed. Agatha isn’t sure if the feeling is bad or good, but after what just took place, she thinks it’s the latter.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha finds a moment to make a b-line for the exit after being stuck in multiple conversations nearly the entire night. Her ear had been mostly chatted off by the youngest intern, Billy Kaplan, who <em> had </em> to make sure she knew who he was and how much he looked up to her. He’d at least spent a solid ten minutes giving a detailed backstory to his upbringing and how it deeply affected him as a person. Agatha may have caught two words of his entire monologue, but she’d managed to hear every word of Rio’s conversation with Matt behind her. </p><p>Her smooth, raspy voice carried to the CEO’s ears like a song. From eavesdropping, she’d gathered that Rio and Matt were very close best friends. They seemed <em>very</em> comfortable with each other as they were devising a plan for Matt to leave with the waitress. </p><p>Agatha secretly wished they were devising a plan to get Rio back into the bathroom, but unfortunately, she’d never be so lucky. She asked herself what was stopping her from taking charge herself—finishing what she so clearly had started. She was feeling brazen, but not enough to be so reckless out in the open. Despite every fiber of her being declaring the opposite, she stayed put in her seat and settled for stealing glances of the younger woman when she could—which was ninety percent of the time. If Rio noticed, she didn’t acknowledge it.</p><p>So as she currently stands on the curb, back resting against the gritty brick wall of the restaurant as she waits for her driver, Christian, she closes her eyes and lets out an exhale towards the light polluted stars. She needed to get a grip on herself, like, yesterday. </p><p>She’s not sure if it’s the night air or some steadfast moment of clarity, but something like regret puddles in the bottom of her stomach. It’s a new feeling. There’s not much she let’s eat away at her, but tonight, one thought stands taller than the rest—She shouldn’t have done that. <em>Fuck</em>, she shouldn’t have kissed Rio like <em> that</em>. She shouldn’t look at Rio like she’s the lever to the ‘escape Ralph’ switch. She could be irrational and impulsive at times, but she was never reckless.</p><p>But—<em>fuck</em>, did recklessness feel sweet.</p><p>She can still feel the woman’s lips against hers, lingering with the taste of wine and chapstick. There’s still pressure on her arms from the grip Rio had on her biceps, digging her nails in as if to stake a claim. Agatha hasn’t ached like this in a long, <em>long </em> time. It feels exhilarating to crave something so strictly forbidden by every damn rule in the universe. She’s supposed to be faithful. She’s supposed to remain professional. But so help her God, it feels absolutely <em> delicious </em> to know those things and ignore them anyways for the way it feels to crave Rio. It’s starting to feel suffocating. </p><p>“Boo,” comes a voice directly over her shoulder. She snaps open her eyes, head ripping to the source of the sound and she finds those dark eyes that haven’t left her head the entire night. She exhales a laugh, rolling her eyes. The universe absolutely hates her. Rio sidles up next to her, leaning on her side against the wall. “Did you think you could hide from me?”</p><p>Agatha brushes off the comment. “Shouldn't you be inside?”</p><p>“Shouldn’t <em> you</em>?”</p><p>Agatha shrugs, but again doesn’t acknowledge the comment. As they both stand there, Agatha staring forward into the city and Rio staring right into Agatha, the silence doesn’t feel unwelcome. It feels like an acknowledgement. Though, the way the younger woman keeps her eyes on her so intently makes her feel a vulnerability so strong, she starts to squirm. The pull of regret gets tighter. She doesn’t look at Rio as she speaks, “Why the fuck do you always look at me like that?”</p><p>She hears Rio laugh. “You’re one to talk about looking. The right side of my face was burning all night.”</p><p>So Rio did notice her staring. She’s so fucked. </p><p>“Yeah, well, your staring is different. Your eyes are <em>so</em> intense. You don’t just stare, you read into me. It’s like you fucking—<em>fuck,</em>” The CEO’s composure crumbles, she turns to face Rio head on, though she’s mindful to keep a respectful distance between them as though to keep herself in check. She stares into Rio’s dark eyes, bouncing back and forth between the two like she’s searching for an understanding. She doesn’t find it. She sighs. “You look at me and you make me feel things I don’t want to feel.”</p><p>Rio raises an eyebrow. “You <em> don’t </em> want to feel them, you say?“</p><p>Agatha sighs, “I had a momentary lapse in judgement.”</p><p>The younger woman laughs. “Which moment was that? When you kissed me or when you told me you’d make me <em> beg </em> for you to bend me over?”</p><p>“Jesus christ,” the CEO grunts, a hand coming up to pinch the bridge between her nose. “I know—I know I’m a <em> fucking </em> mess. Just make this easy for me, <em> please</em>. You don’t understand.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t budge and neither does her resolve. “I’m just trying to figure you out Agatha. There’s parts of you that are so easy to ready, but you’re fucking driving me crazy with this back and forth.”</p><p>“See, you say weird, cryptic shit like that and it scares the shit out of me,” Agatha leans forward, lowering her voice an octave, “I have a life you know nothing about, Rio. I’m engaged. I have an entire company’s worth of baggage hanging over my head like a damn guillotine and some… <em> fucking… </em>insane intern comes into my life and…”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>Agatha laughs and it comes out wet, charged with velocity. She starts to fiddle with her engagement ring. The pause to take a deep breath feels like an eternity. She knows what she wants to say. Had she not been trying so desperately to get back to a sense of normalcy, she wouldn’t have second guessed it. But now, looking at the woman in front of her directly in her eyes, she feels the thread of guilt snap. Their lips are so close, noses almost touching and if anyone takes notice of them, it lacks importance in comparison to the way it feels to be so close to getting what Agatha so desperately needs. </p><p>“And she makes me want to fuck her senseless—until her <em> goddamn </em> smart mouth doesn’t know how to run anymore.”</p><p>The whimper that Rio lets out surprises them both. </p><p>“So what’s stopping you from taking what you want,” Rio shakily whispers. </p><p>Agatha sets her lips. “We both know what. This <em> cannot </em> happen. There’s too much at risk.”</p><p>”Is it really that or are you just lying to yourself?”</p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes. “What the fuck is that supposed to mean?”</p><p>Rio’s laugh is dry. “It means you know that you want this just as much as I do. You’re fighting it because you think you can lie to me too. I’m not so easy to fool. I see the way you look at me. The way you just <em>fucking</em> kissed me…”</p><p>Agatha sighs deeply, her shoulders falling in defeat. “Then you know how much it’s killing me to pull back from this Rio. It’s the right thing to do and you know it.”</p><p>”<em>Fuck</em> the right thing, Agatha.”</p><p>”<em>You</em> can say that,” Agatha exclaims, her hands flying up in a brief swell of anger. “You don’t have anything to lose. I have my entire life riding on this. I—<em>fuck</em>, Rio. You don’t know what I’ve done to get here. What I’ve had to sacrifice. You barely know me.”</p><p>“Do you want me to <em>actually </em>beg for you, Agatha,” It’s almost a whine at this point. “I can <em> beg</em>. I’ll get on my knees. I’ll crawl. I’ll—“</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whispers breathlessly as she closes her eyes and releases a deep breath. She is <em> not </em> God’s strongest soldier. The keen ability for Rio to go from the brattiest girl she’s ever met to a pool of jelly in Agatha’s hands astounds her completely. My God, she needs this woman viscerally. She clears her throat. “The line is drawn here, okay?”</p><p>“Mhmm,” Rio dismisses, tearing her eyes away from the CEO for the first time in this entire conversation. Agatha sets her jaw. She doesn’t like it.</p><p>She pulls a cigarette from her purse and a lighter from her key ring. When she places the bud between her lips, Agatha watches intently. She uses the pause to gain her bearings back. </p><p>Rio rips the bud from her mouth with her fingers, exhaling the smoke and staring out into the city like it’s far too interesting.</p><p>“Just… help me understand where exactly the line is? It’s getting harder to keep up with when the line is getting so jagged. It’s drawn right <em> here </em> when I ask for you to fuck me but it’s a football field away when you feel like putting your tongue in my mouth. How’s that working out, <em> huh</em>?”</p><p>“Rio, just work with me here, <em> please</em>,” Agatha asks softly. “<em>Fuck</em>—I know I’ll regret it but I don’t care if you make you’re annoying ass little remarks. You can be the same. Nothing has to change. Just—Just no touching okay? That’s my line.”</p><p>The younger woman brings her eyes back to Agatha. There’s a flicker of challenge in them. A beat of silence. And then, “Okay, Agatha.”</p><p>Rio throws the cigarette down and crushes it under her heel. She sends one last tight smile to her boss and turns to leave, throwing one last comment over her shoulder. “See you Monday.”</p><p>Agatha gets one last look at the tattoo before Rio rounds the corner and disappears completely. Suddenly every passing car is a victim to the onslaught of <em> fucks </em> leaving Agatha’s mouth.</p><p align="center">—</p><p>“Have you been up all night?”</p><p>A voice startles Agatha from her computer as she shoots herself upright against the back of her chair. She looks over to the doorway to see Ralph standing there against the frame, arms crossed against his chest and every single blond hair on his head disheveled out of place. <em> All night? Has she been working that long? </em> She then looks at the tiny clock in the corner of her computer screen and reads <em> 7:30 am</em>. She nearly gasps. </p><p>“Oh wow,” she looks back over to him over the edge of her glasses. “Yeah I guess I have been. I’m sorry, I didn’t realize.”</p><p>“Things busy at work?”</p><p>Agatha swallows. “Yeah, one of the publishing companies I oversee is merging with another company from outside our market. We’re in the process of completing the merger between the two, but the firm that I don’t oversee has us going through their legal team to gain access and it’s all just a headache.”</p><p>“Sounds like it.”</p><p>It’s not a total lie. She really is dealing with a pain in the ass merger, but she’d only opted to work on it because she couldn’t sleep. And laying there thinking about the other pain in her side named Rio only made her squirm. </p><p>There’s a lingering silence that stays. It’s heavy and unwanted, but neither of them move to push it out of the way. It’s like there’s something moving under the surface that Ralph wants to say and Agatha <em> knows </em>he wants to, but neither knows how to approach it so it stays just like everything else in their relationship; untouched. </p><p>Ralph clears his throat. “I’m gonna go take a shower and head into the site for some overtime. I uh– hope things sort themselves out. I know you’ll give ‘em hell until they do.”</p><p>Agatha nods with a laugh. “You know me. See you for dinner?”</p><p>He crosses into the room and leans down over Agatha’s head to place a small kiss on her hairline. It makes her feel warm and fuzzy. “Sure thing.”</p><p>When he exits, she sighs and lets her head fall down into her hands. When Agatha had arrived at her apartment last night, it was one am and entirely too quiet. Their bedroom door was shut, which alluded her to the fact that Ralph had decided not to wait up for her. She hadn’t expected any different honestly. And she really wasn’t ready to see him and break whatever adrenaline was running through her veins after her kiss and conversation with Rio. </p><p><em> God,</em> Agatha finds herself thinking about it as she stands up from her desk and pads her way over to the bathroom. She thinks about it when she brushes her teeth. When she pours her coffee, but especially when she walks over to the large glass windows and looks out at the city. She’d never installed curtains. Rio really was onto something when she suggested Agatha liked to be watched because as it stands, she really has no argument in her favor. <em> Maybe Rio likes it too and that’s why she was so quick to suggest it? What would she think about being taken against this very glass window? </em> Agatha squints and she can almost see the handprints on the glass– the puffs of condensation from heavy breathing. She can feel her fingers tracing the delicate lines of the tattoo as she fills her from behind.</p><p>She shivers at the thought. <em> Distance was the right thing. </em></p><p>Agatha finds herself repeating that phrase inside her head like a sacred mantra all throughout her Sunday routine. </p><p>Craving Rio has become all consuming. From the moment the young intern had stepped into the CEO’s office, Agatha has had a pull in her chest that she can’t quite explain. Whatever they have, albeit strange, is going to fuck her up unlike anything she’s ever come across.</p><p><em> Distance was the right thing</em>. </p><p>If just anyone had come in and acted out the way that Rio had, Agatha would’ve had them hitting the pavement before HR could even pick up the phone. But for some reason, Rio’s not only still around, but still under her skin like an itch she hadn’t been allowed to scratch. </p><p>Speaking of itches, her phone rings. When she sees the name on the screen, she smiles to herself and answers, “Jennifer?”</p><p>“<em>Hello to you too, Agatha</em>,” comes the voice of her best friend Jen. “<em>You’ve been quiet since the dinner. I was beginning to wonder if I was going to need to start looking around for a new best friend</em>?”</p><p>Agatha laughs. “Yeah, good luck ever finding someone as <em> charming </em> and <em> down to earth </em> as me. I'm irreplaceable, darling.”</p><p>“<em>Oh, I must have the wrong number,</em>” Jen exclaims. “<em>I’m looking for Agatha Harkness? Heartless witch with a false sense of self and a mean streak just as long as the distance between her and an ounce of human decency? Have you seen her?</em>”</p><p>“Oh Jen, that might be the nicest thing you’ve ever said about me.”</p><p>“<em>Jesus, you’re so fucked up</em>.”</p><p>“Two compliments in a row,” Agatha says, her voice taking on a teasing, flirty inflection. “Careful now, flattery will get you everywhere.”</p><p>“<em>You’re incorrigible</em>.”</p><p>“Add it to the ongoing list of my best qualities.”</p><p>“<em>Sure, it’ll go right under pain in the ass,</em>” Jen scoffs. “<em>Anyways, now that I know you’re alive, how was the dinner?</em>”</p><p>They catch up over the small things that aren’t important to anyone else but either of them. Of course, Agatha leaves out some small, Rio sized details. It’s not that she doesn’t want to share with her best friend, it’s that she’s not ready to share Rio yet. Rio feels like a separate world.</p><p>When the phone hangs up, Agatha realizes she’s laying in her bed on her back sprawled out like a starfish in defeat. She doesn’t know how much time passes, but she wakes up with dried drool on her cheek and darkness surrounding her from the lack of sun. She’d passed out for nearly ten hours, the lack of sleep from the past week catching up to her like a brushfire. She can’t remember the last time she’d slept longer than four hours.</p><p align="center">—</p><p>Monday morning comes quickly. And there’s a large coffee waiting on her desk when she enters her office. She knows who it’s from immediately, but the black ink written across the side confirms it,</p><p align="center">
<em> Game on  x</em>
</p><p>Rio becomes incredibly good at being invisible when she normally has mastered the skill of popping in and out of Agatha’s bubble at exactly the right times. The next time Agatha sees Rio is on Wednesday right before her board meeting with her legal team. It’s nearly lunch, most of the interns are out but Rio is sitting at her desk intently typing away. Agatha goes to approach her, but Rio puts a hand up without even glancing her way. </p><p>“Line,” she says, a smirk threatening to show.</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. “Oh so you’re the one drawing lines now?”</p><p>Rio shakes her head, eyes still trained down at her screen. “Nope, not my line. Just making sure you remember yours as your judgment gets questionable at times—"</p><p>“It does not!”</p><p>Rio tears her eyes to Agatha, one eyebrow raised in scrutiny. She doesn’t say anything though and Agatha silently thanks the universe for that. </p><p>“Okay, so I strayed from the path once,” Agatha declares. Rio squints further. “Okay twice.”</p><p>Rio nods. “Besides, If I wanted to draw any lines, I’d choose my finger nails down your back—“</p><p>“That’s enough.”</p><p align="center">—</p><p>It’s Friday and Agatha’s last nerve is shot. She’s been on the phone for the last hour with a rep for the company joining in the merger and they just can’t seem to hammer out anything to agree on. She’s been pacing the floor of her office, phone pressed firmly into her ear. She briefly paused to tell Wanda to have an intern fetch her some coffee of course, but other than that, she’d been ruthlessly shutting greedy men down left and right. When she hears her door open, of course it’s Rio with her coffee. </p><p>She smiles tightly at her and reaches out to take the cup from her hand. She’s barely gotten the coffee from Rio’s grasp before she’s back to barking over the phone, “Listen. I don’t give a <em> fuck </em> what you guys were doing before. That’s why your business is going under and you’ve come running to me to save it. So let me save it <em> my </em> way or you go <em> fuck </em> yourself right on into bankruptcy.”</p><p>Agatha is so blinded by rage that she doesn’t notice the way Rio hasn’t moved—hasn’t blinked once. She stands on her two feet, stuck in place as she stares into Agatha with wide eyes. The CEO only notices a second later when she turns her body to pace the other direction and she pulls the phone away from her ear, holding it out away from her. </p><p>“What,” she hisses.</p><p>Rio swallows twice, licks her lips, and says, “You’re so mean… I need you so <em>fucking</em> badly.”</p><p>“Out.”</p><p>The rest of Friday and much of Saturday passes in a blur. She barely sees Ralph as she’s tucked away in her office for most of it. It’s Saturday evening before she finally breaks ground in the merger and she finally gets a meeting set up between their legal teams. It’s a small victory, but she feels like celebrating. She calls Jen without giving it a second thought and tells her to find a bar and send her the address asap. </p><p><em> Is this a good drink or a bad drink? </em> Jen responds and Agatha just simply says, <em> Good</em>. </p><p>Agatha doesn’t even look at the bar she sends. She just texts Christian to let him know she needs a ride. While she waits, she thinks about changing her clothes. <em> Aren’t you supposed to do that sort of thing when you go out? Look presentable or something? </em>It’s been so long that the CEO can’t even bring herself to really care.</p><p>She settles for staying in her oxford button up, loose jeans hanging around her legs and throws on the nearest black shoes she can find. She does run a brush through her hair as she’s not completely unhinged. By the time she’s done giving herself a once over in the mirror, her driver’s outside and she texts Jen she’s on the way. </p><p>When she arrives, her friend is waiting outside with her face buried in her phone. She doesn’t notice Agatha’s arrival until she clears her throat. Jen ushers them both inside excitedly and it doesn’t take Agatha very long to notice the crowd is very androgynous. There’s pride flags hanging from the ceiling, but that’s become just the standard in the city so it doesn’t immediately register to her. The bar is dark. Industrial with high ceilings. She’d go as far to say this is definitely a club. There’s music thumping from a Dj leading a crowd of people on the dance floor and there’s a bar in the corner of the place that’s calling her name. She tugs Jen’s hand and dips her head over towards it.</p><p>“You go ahead. Alice is in here somewhere. I’m gonna find her. Get me something fruity.”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, but continues towards the bar anyways. She doesn’t haven’t any trouble working her way through the crowd, but she does have trouble breathing when she sees who’s going to be making her drinks. </p><p>As if the universe hadn’t given her enough trouble, Rio is tending to the bar. And not just tending to it, she’s <em> tending </em> to nearly every woman crowding around the space. Her hair is messy, but pulled back into a quick bun. A pen sticks out from behind her ear—<em>hot</em>—and she’s got more skin showing on her upper body than clothes. What she’s wearing should be defined as a sleeveless crop top, but Agatha is defining it as a cardinal sin. </p><p>It’s showing off her entirely too toned midsection and when she turns around you can see the bottom of her tattoo ever so slightly. Her arms strain as she lifts and pours bottles with her nimble, talented fingers. She winks and smiles as she hands over her finished concoctions and Agatha has never felt so powerless in her life. Watching these women fawn over Rio, it’s making her uncomfortable. </p><p>She swallows thickly, and brushes her way up to the bar completely. Like a magnet, Rio turns to her immediately. Her lips tick up into a smile as she starts to slide over in front of the older woman. Agatha eyes her cautiously. </p><p>“My, my,” Rio toys, leaning across the bar on her forearms. “The queen does leave her throne.”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. “You’re being a <em> little </em> dramatic.”</p><p>“Sure, Ms. Harkness. Whatever you say,” Rio laughs. “What are you doing here? Did you miss me that much?”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, but her chest flutters anyways. “In your dreams… I finally secured a meeting with the merger team's law firm. My friend Jen and I are out celebrating."</p><p>“No shit. That’s awesome. But <em>uh</em>—where’s your friend? Are you sure they exist?”</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>“I’m just checking,” Rio defends, throwing her hands up in mock surrender. “You’ve shocked me twice in one night. A friend and an evening <em> not </em> in your office.”</p><p>“I’m full of surprises, Miss Vidal.”</p><p>“I don’t doubt that, Ms. Harkness.”</p><p>The pause is pregnant and lingering. The glint in Rio’s eyes is anything but innocent and the way that she’s leaning into Agatha like it’s purely muscle memory settles a low rumble in the older woman’s stomach.  Rio seems to be forgetting that she’s working and Agatha seems to be forgetting she’s supposed to be keeping her distance. She should <em> not </em> be near Rio in any capacity that doesn’t have a legal department hanging over their heads to keep the CEO in check. Her track record of moment’s outside of work with the younger woman doesn’t exactly work in her favor.</p><p>She’s halfway to opening her mouth to make a comment on that fact when a woman clears her throat beside her. She’s young and blonde with a full face of makeup and dress that shouldn’t pass as more than a t-shirt with the way it barely covers her ass. She looks between the two of them, smiling tightly at Agatha and then when she turns to Rio, her entire demeanor shifts. Agatha knows <em> that </em>look like the back of her hand. And like a switch, Rio turns on her hospitality mode. </p><p>She looks over to the blonde, a crooked smile on her lips as she asks, “What can I get you, babe?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes turn wide. <em> Babe</em>? </p><p>“Umm—” the woman taps her chin with her finger. “What’s your favorite?”</p><p><em> Oh come on bitch. Just order a drink. </em>Agatha thinks as she grinds her teeth down into one another, her fingernails making impressive marks on her legs under her jeans.</p><p>“I’ll be right back,” Rio says sweetly and <em> fucking </em> winks. <em> Unbelievable</em>.</p><p>In her absence, the woman beside her has taken it upon herself to include Agatha in on her conversation as if the older woman gave her that impression at all. “She’s hot, isn’t she?”</p><p>Agatha smiles tightly, her eyes squinting. “I hear she’s bad in bed.”</p><p>The blonde must get the hint because when Rio returns with a drink, she takes it from her with a quick flick of her wrist, leaving a wadded up pile of cash in her wake. Rio looks at Agatha, eyebrow raised, “What did you do?”</p><p>Agatha scoffs and covers her hand with her chest. “How dare you?”</p><p>“Oh please. I know you–”</p><p>“Maybe she just wasn’t interested,” Agatha suggests. Rio pokes her tongue against the inside of her cheek and leans down towards Agatha with either of her hands placed firmly on the bar in front of her.</p><p>“Impossible, they’re <em> always </em>interested.”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, but that pull in her stomach returns. Rio’s confidence is both her end and her beginning. It’s incredibly irritating, but incredibly sexy at the same time. It does absolutely nothing to help her keep things neutral. She’s feeling very chaotic-neutral as it stands. </p><p>“I mean, then again,” Agatha says almost breathlessly and then she clears her throat as if snapping back into herself. “You are here flaunting everything you’ve got. No wonder they’re fawning over you like you’re the best thing since sliced bread. Leave something to the imagination, why don’t ya.”</p><p>Rio quirks an eyebrow. “Careful now… Wouldn’t want your jealousy to show.” </p><p>“You wish,” Agatha snarls, but Rio just continues to look at her so intently, she feels the hairs on her body rise. “Okay—<em>Fuck, </em> I’m too sober for this. Give me a shot of something clear.”</p><p>Rio nods. “Sure thing, <em> babe</em>.”</p><p>“Oh <em> fuck </em> you,” Agatha curses, to which Rio just laughs. Agatha swears she hears an <em> I’m trying</em>, but she’d rather not acknowledge it and live her life the way she was ten minutes ago before whatever just transpired here. Rio reaches into the cabinets below the bar in front of her and pulls out two shot glasses. She sets them in front of the CEO softly, and then fills them up with what Agatha assumes to be tequila, but she’s not paying much attention to the label as she is Rio’s long fingers covering it as she pours. </p><p>When she takes one and hands it to Agatha, the other one she keeps for herself. She points her glass towards the older woman for a toast. “To finally getting that meeting.”</p><p>Agatha breathes a sigh of relief. “To finally getting that meeting.” </p><p>She throws the liquor down her throat with a quick flick of her wrist and ignores the way Rio doesn’t even flinch because then she’ll have to acknowledge how incredibly attractive that is. When she places her glass back down on the bar, Rio has the bottle hovering over it, once again, filling it back up.</p><p>“What are you—“</p><p>“This one,” Rio says as she picks her filled glass back up as well. “is to drawing lines.”</p><p>The glint in her eye can’t be mistaken. </p><p>Agatha fights the urge to roll her eyes for the third time tonight, but complies nonetheless. “To drawing lines.”</p><p>Things get a little blurry from there. Jen finds her at the bar with Alice and a few of her friends in tow. She questions why Agatha hadn’t ordered her drink yet, but then she’s quick to order a round of shots before the CEO can even rebuttal. Agatha already feels her head spinning, but she agrees to take one anyway. Rio is the one that pours it for them, naturally. She keeps her head down when she tops off their glasses, but she saves a wink for Agatha as she hands them out. Now, after the shots been properly downed, she can feel the tingles in her body start to take over. She’s definitely not drunk. Have a few edges been taken off? Abso–<em>fucking</em>–lutely. </p><p>And that’s exactly what she needs. So she opts to join her friends on the dance floor and forget about the merger—forget about Ralph, but Rio stays. She always does.</p><p>Sometime throughout the night, she’d rolled the sleeves of her shirt up while also unbuttoning a few buttons down her chest. It had gotten incredibly hot and she’d stopped herself multiple times from discarding it completely as there were plenty of other women in less. She would know. A few of them had come up to dance with her. So now as it stands, the near fifty year old woman is dancing in a crowd of women, feeling every single sensation in her bones from the thruming of the bass. She doesn’t know how long she’s been at it, but her mouth is dry and her body feels like it might give out if she doesn’t sit down for a second. So naturally, she goes to the bar.</p><p>There’s less people there, but Rio still has her crowd. Agatha blames the liquor as to why she suddenly feels agitated. But when Rio sees her and smiles, she forgets why she’d even cared for the other women anyways. Rio clearly doesn’t. </p><p>“Hey there,” Rio says. “You look like you’re having fun.”</p><p>Agatha laughs. “<em>Fuck—</em>I haven’t moved like that in years. I forgot how free it makes me feel.”</p><p>“Yeah I get that feeling,” Rio affirms, but her eyes suddenly track down Agatha’s body and Agatha remembers she’s got half of her chest nearly hanging out. There’s just a hint of a lacy black garment peaking through the undone buttons of her shirt, but it’s enough to draw Rio’s attention evidently. </p><p>“My eyes are up here, Vidal,” Agatha says, but Rio doesn’t make a move at all. She just smirks, eyes somehow becoming even darker.</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitches. Maybe her inhibitions are lower from the alcohol. Maybe it’s just the effect Rio has on her finally hitting its mark. The way Rio’s looking at her sets her on fire. She feels good. She feels sexy and desired. She wants to cling onto that feeling. She’s tired of fighting it. She deserves to feel free. She deserves to get what she wants. </p><p>“Dance with me,” she blurts out without even thinking. Surprisingly, she doesn’t regret it in the slightest. She’s hopeful. </p><p>Rio looks like she rolls it over in her mind with her signature trademark of her tongue knocking against her cheek as she thinks it over. Agatha feels her body clinging onto every second that passes without an answer and she’s sure she might collapse if she doesn’t get one so, but Rio doesn’t seem like she’s going to give in anytime soon. She seems distant—afraid to give in to the thoughts passing through her mind and really, Agatha only has herself to blame because she just had to go and ask for distance as if that would’ve gotten them anywhere but right here. <em>Fuck</em>.</p><p>“I know what you’re thinking,” Agatha starts, ass saving mode kicking in to overdrive. “And I don’t care—about any of it right now. It’s just dancing. Have fun with me. Please. You can yell at me tomorrow about sending mixed signals, okay?”</p><p>Rio bites her bottom lip and swallows twice. Apprehension colors her features as her shoulders tighten before they <em>finally </em>drop and she hangs her head down for just a few seconds as if surrendering herself over. Agatha starts rocking on her heels, giddy.</p><p>“You better not make me regret this, Harkness.”</p><p>When Rio rounds the bar and Agatha clasps her hand around her wrist, Rio looks down at it like she can’t believe what she’s seeing. Agatha doesn’t second guess it though. She’s far past thinking rationally about anything that doesn’t involve getting Rio on the dance floor. She makes sure to grip harder against Rio’s wrist, pulling the raven haired girl behind her until they reach an opening in the vastly moving crowd.</p><p>The lights around them are strobing on and Agatha sees Rio in every split second of light just like she sees Rio every time she closes her eyes—in flashes. Her eyes are dark, but they hold Agatha’s strong gaze as if dropping their staring contest would mean losing this moment entirely. It’s evident that’s something Rio would rather die than let happen. So she waits patiently for the older woman to make the first move as if she’s scared to do the wrong thing and end right back where they started.</p><p>And Agatha, well, she decides it’s now or never. She’s got the girl she can’t stop thinking about—the girl who’s lips still haunt her—within arms reach, looking at her like she’s not a complete fucking mess and somehow holds the answers to everything she’s ever needed in life. The distance between them burns. Agatha needs to crush it until there’s absolutely no reminder of just how separated they actually are. </p><p>She reaches out to snake a hand around Rio’s bare waist and pulls their bodies flush together. When their hips collide, it’s like something activates in her core. Agatha starts moving against her, her hands roaming over the expansive skin of Rio’s exposed torso. There’s a pause before Rio reaches out and dips into the back pocket of Agatha jeans with one hand and threads through Agatha’s hair with the other. </p><p>It’s electric—the feeling. </p><p>Every nerve ending inside Agatha’s brain is firing at once. Her fingertips burn against Rio’s toned skin like she’s somehow gotten too close to the sun. The way her skin is warm and smooth, but also silky and wet with sweat send her into a frenzy. With her right hand, she gently slides her finger up the outer side of Rio’s toned arm, following her fingers the whole way with her eyes like she’s revealing some hidden message. She feels Rio flex under her touch and as a result, she grips the back of Agatha’s hair and pulls firmly. The older woman lets her head fall into Rio’s palm. She takes a thick swallow and juts her neck out just a little more before she feels Rio’s breath hot against it. Agatha shivers, feeling the sensation spread lower into her core.</p><p>Mimicking the younger woman, Agatha slides her hand from where she’s been gripping Rio’s bicep to the bun on the back of her head. She threads her fingers through the hair tie there and pulls it loose, wrapping it around her own wrists like a memento. </p><p>Agatha fists the now fallen hair into her palm, pushing Rio further into her neck. She can feel Rio moan against her skin and every single inhibition she could've had left the building and is never coming back. </p><p>She uses the leverage of Rio’s hair in her fist to pull the younger woman back from her neck to find brown eyes again. Just for a second, she needed to be grounded back down to Earth. But then, Rio smiles at her and everything from there on is a direct consequence of that look. Feeling emboldened, Agatha releases her hand from Rio’s hair and grabs both of the woman’s wrists. Rio looks confused for a moment until Agatha moves her hands towards the last few remaining buttons of her shirt. Rio makes quick work of undoing the few buttons left and when Agatha's shirt falls open to show off her own toned stomach and very risque, lacy bra–she can see the darkening of Rio’s gaze and it suddenly becomes much more intense.</p><p>Rio’s hands slide up her sides in anticipation. They haven’t stopped moving to the rhythm, so Agatha’s chest is not only on full display, but it's <em> bouncing</em>. She sees the way Rio’s mouth opens and closes before she vaguely makes out the word <em>fuck </em>and she’s never wished to hear someone’s voice so badly before. Before she misses anything else, she reaches her hands back up into the hair behind Rio’s head and pulls her back sharply so that if she speaks again, Agatha will hear it. </p><p>Rio’s finger tips are running under the seam of her bra like she’s memorizing a path and Agatha tries not to think about how good her fingers would feel underneath the garment instead. She feels weak. Their foreheads collide as she leans forward for support and it's wet and sticky. Their skin slides together as they move, bodies producing much more heat than anyone else around them.</p><p>They’re so close. Their noses are mere inches apart. Rio’s licking her lips and Agatha is holding her breath like this moment might end if she breathes. When Rio drops her hands and pulls Agatha’s waist to her own again, it’s the final snap in the coil. Now that her shirt is undone, their bare skin is touching and Agatha needs more. So much more. </p><p>
<em> Fuck it. </em>
</p><p>Before she can overthink it, she has Rio by the wrist again and she’s leading her back away from the crowd and to the direction of the bathroom. She feels resistance from Rio and when she turns around to see why, the younger girl is shaking her head. Agatha furrows her brow, but Rio just pulls her in the opposite direction. They end up in an employee’s only space and when Rio opens the door to let them in, it's virtually just a closet with a table in it. </p><p>“I am <em>not </em> going into another bathroom with you,” comes Rio’s voice, but it’s lacking its normal strength. It’s shaky and raspy. She lets go of Agatha’s hand to turn around and face the older woman. When Agatha finally lays eyes on her in the light, she knows there is no turning back. Rio has her. She fucking <em> has </em>her.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha reaches out with her finger, dragging it up the length of the younger girl’s bicep until she reaches the neck of her shirt. She tucks her finger under the collar there, tugging on it softly in an effort to pull Rio closer into her and the dark haired girl nearly whimpers again. It’s the first time she’s let her first name roll off her tongue and she revels in the way Rio reacts to it. She almost whimpers.</p><p>Agatha flutters her eyes down to Rio’s lips, darting her tongue out to wet her own lips in anticipation. “I’m going to kiss you now, okay?”</p><p>Rio swallows thickly, jutting her neck out like it was painful. “What about the line?”</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em> the line.”</p><p>And then Agatha’s lips are pulled into a bruising kiss so hard that she's leaving absolutely no doubt about what she wants at all. Her hands are everywhere all at once. On Rio’s shoulders, her stomach, her ass—she can’t get enough. Nothing feels like enough. Rio tastes like salt, tequila and everything she’s ever been missing. </p><p>Rio is also moaning into her mouth and whimpering against her lips helplessly. Agatha doesn’t miss the way Rio’s knees start to shake against hers. Mimicking their first time, Agatha backs the younger woman up against the table. Rio hops up onto it on her own terms this time and Agatha laughs against her mouth.</p><p>“Shut up,” comes Rio’s muffled response.</p><p>“Make me,” is Agatha’s rebuttal and Rio is back to work like she never said anything at all. Her legs wrap around Agatha’s waist and pull her closer. Her hands tangle in the older woman’s thick tresses like she’s grasping for anything to keep herself grounded. Agatha runs her hands up Rio’s sides until she reaches the hem of her crop top and she tugs at it until Rio lifts her hands in the air. </p><p>It’s over the younger woman’s head in seconds, but when Agatha looks down to give attention to her chest, there’s yet another secret unveiled. A floral sternum tattoo. She’s got two vines running under the cups of each of her breasts. Agatha feels lightheaded. </p><p>“Oh—<em>fuck you,</em>” Agatha sighs, bringing a hand up to trace the lines that stretch under them. She doesn’t miss the way goosebumps form under her touch either.</p><p>”You’re not the only one with surprises,” Rio says with her best attempt at restoring some confidence, but it quickly shatters under Agatha’s touch as she slides her fingers underneath the seam of her bra. Her finger tips rub over her nipple, alighting the skin there immediately. </p><p>“<em>Please,</em>” Rio whimpers and Agatha snatches her eyes back up into Rio’s like a rubber band. </p><p>
<em> Oh she’s gonna beg. </em>
</p><p>Agatha’s pupils are definitely blown. Her lips are swollen and her underwear is damn near ruined, but if Rio starts begging, she cannot be held responsible for any more damage that gets incurred.</p><p>“Please, <em>what</em>,” Agatha whispers against Rio’s lips, her hand tracing down the middle trail of Rio’s stomach. The younger woman leans back onto her hands, her hips lifting into Agatha’s touch. </p><p>“Please <em> touch </em>me,” Rio whines, her eyes looking into Agatha’s—just pleading with every fiber of her being.</p><p>“Where… <em> Here</em>?”</p><p>Agatha toys as she runs a finger under the waistband of Rio’s pants before releasing it with a pop. She watches as Rio swallows before Agatha brings her hand back up to cup her breast over her bra—her thumb resting just over her nipple. “<em>Here</em>?”</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>,” Rio says breathlessly as a moan topples from her throat. She digs her nails into Agatha’s bicep. The older woman likes the sound of her name on Rio’s tongue. It’s intoxicating. </p><p>“Tell me,” <em> a pause</em>. “Where you want me, Rio.”</p><p>Agatha leans forward, her nose nudging against Rio’s as the younger girl's mouth falls open at the contact. Rio turns her face, leaving Agatha pressed into her side, her mouth hovering near her ear. </p><p>“Inside, <em> please</em>.”</p><p>Agatha chuckles against her ear. “Good girl.”</p><p>Rio moans in response, but the cry that leaves her mouth when Agatha dips below the waistline of her pants is lethal. Agatha mirrors the sound. She’s not even being touched and it’s like she’s feeling everything that Rio is times ten. It’s the feel of Rio’s arousal coating her fingers—the way nearly every muscle in the younger girls collapses when Agatha slides a finger in. </p><p>“<em>Jesus christ</em>, you’re so <em> wet.</em>” </p><p>“<em>Fuck </em> yes,” Rio says as she starts grinding her hips down onto the digit inside of her. “More. <em> Please. </em>More.”</p><p>“Well, since you asked so nicely,” Agatha coos as she slides in yet another finger and Rio’s whole world rocks. She starts moving in and out slowly, committing to memory the sound of Rio’s deliciously wet center. The grip on Agatha’s bicep gets tighter and the room starts spinning. It only pushes Agatha on further. </p><p>She starts curling her fingers inside as she speeds up the pace of her thrusts. </p><p>“God yes,” Rio cries. “Give <em> it </em> to me.”</p><p>Agatha leans forward and captures Rio’s lips between hers. Even though their lips are on completely different rhythms, it’s the best kiss Agatha has ever had. Their chests are heaving rapidly against one another. The table underneath Rio is smacking against the wall in time with the thumping of the music lingering in the background as Agatha fucks into her with everything she has. </p><p>The soft whimpers. The sound of wetness. The feel of Rio’s nails against her back. Agatha doesn’t ever want it to end. If she could stay right here inside of Rio for the rest of her life, she’d be content. Knowing that it would bring this moment to an end, she raises her thumb against Rio’s clit anyways. </p><p>“<em>Shit,</em>” Rio whines again though it almost comes out like a sob. “You feel so <em> fucking </em> good.” </p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha asks, her eyebrow cocked. “You gonna come for me then?”</p><p>“<em>Yes</em>,” Rio says it once and then she chants it like a mantra as she continues her grind down onto Agatha digits. “<em>Please </em> make me come, Agatha. I’m <em> so </em> close.”</p><p>Agatha can tell her tension is building—that Rio is almost over the sweet, sweet summit. Her wrist is burning and Rio’s nearly drawing blood on her back, but she’d rather die than stop. She thrusts her fingers in hard, moves her thumb against Rio’s clit a little faster and the way Rio’s mouth goes slack nearly makes Agatha come on the spot.</p><p>“Oh <em> fuck</em>, I’m gonna come.”</p><p>“Soak my hand, sweetheart. Let me feel you.”</p><p>“I’m coming—I’m coming—I’m—<em>fuck</em>.”</p><p>Agatha feels the way Rio clenches around her finger and releases a gush of wetness against her palm. Her chest is heaving up and down, legs shaking around Agatha’s waist, but Agatha still fucks her through it like it’s her purpose in life. </p><p>When Rio comes back down to Earth, her eyes are glossy and there's a languid smile on her face. “I think, you just fucked the life out of me.” </p><p>Agatha laughs and removes her hands from inside of Rio and the younger girl whimpers at the loss. Agatha goes to wipe her fingers against her jeans, but Rio stops her with a hand wrapped around her wrist. She brings Agatha’s wet fingers up to her lips and takes them into her mouth, sucking them clean. </p><p>“You’re <em> fucking </em> insane,” Agatha groans and snatches her fingers from inside Rio’s mouth to replace them with her tongue. When she tastes the remnants of Rio on the girl's tongue, her eyes roll back in her head. <em> Fuck </em> she’d have to get her mouth on this woman’s center as soon as possible. </p><p>Agatha looks Rio up and down. In all her just fucked and tattooed glory, she can’t imagine never getting to have her way with this woman ever again. There’s so much more to do—so much more for Rio to do. Her boundaries were made of paper that got saturated with water the moment she saw Rio in this bar tonight. She never had a chance. There was never any fight. </p><p>“You’re going to ruin me, Vidal.”</p><p>“Gladly.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha doesn’t remember much about getting home from her very eventful night out. She knows she’d successfully managed to have Christian pick her up just shortly after she’d fucked Rio in to next Tuesday, but the details after that get alittle hazy. She’s almost certain it has to do with the fact that the only thing she had on her mind from the time she’d sat in the car to when she all but flung herself in her bed was Rio’s moans and how soon she could hear them again. If anything else happened, it lacked in comparison. </p><p>Ralph wasn’t there and Agatha didn’t care to wonder why. She relished the feeling of the empty bed and her deliciously filled thoughts pulled her into an immediate slumber. </p><p>She wakes up to find four missed calls from Jen, a text from Alice and a good morning message from Ralph. </p><p>She clicks on Jen first. Agatha has barely got her eyes open as she lays on her back, nose pinched between her fingers. The beeping on the other line only rings out twice before Jen’s voice fills the space and by the immediate tone of her best friend, she knows she’s fucked up in some capacity. </p><p>“<em>What the fuck are you doing </em><em>Agatha</em>,” Jen scolds, but gives the CEO no time to answer. “<em>I don’t know if you’re in some midlife crisis or feeling the emotions of menopause, but—correct me if I’m wrong—an engaged woman shouldn’t be all but fucking a twenty five year old on a public dance floor</em>.”</p><p>Agatha smacks a hand across her forehead and lets it linger in front of her eyes, nursing an incredibly throbbing headache. She knows she was incredibly reckless. Despite her saying she was anything but, she’d gone and lived up to the very definition anyways. Something about Rio and her ability to pull all the untouched strings inside of Agatha just makes any rationality go out of the fucking window. </p><p>“I know Jen,” The CEO sighs, but she doesn’t elaborate any further because she quite honestly doesn’t know what to say. </p><p>“<em>So that’s it? You just ‘know?’</em>”</p><p>“I don’t understand why you’re so upset.” Agatha scoffs. “It has nothing to do with you, Jennifer. I was having a good time—celebrating a <em>fucking</em> colossal win. It doesn’t have to mean more than that.”</p><p>“<em>But it does, doesn’t it?</em>”</p><p>“Stop.”</p><p>
<em>“I saw you, Agatha. Not to mention you don’t even mention Ralph anymore—”</em>
</p><p>“Jen. <em>Stop</em>.”</p><p>It’s a warning. Jen is stomping into territory Agatha herself hasn’t even let herself dare to explore yet. She doesn’t have any right to be asking these questions let alone force Agatha into feeling like she needs to be asking them herself.</p><p>When Agatha sits upright in her bed, she feels the rage pool in her lower stomach. If anyone thinks they understood anything about her, they’d quickly find out just how wrong they are. She’s halfway to ripping Jen a new one when the woman speaks first. </p><p>“<em>Just be careful. Please</em>.”</p><p>The softness to it makes Agatha freeze. When it comes to Jen, they don’t speak outside of subliminal messages when feelings are involved. It doesn’t take Agatha but a second to understand. <em>I’m worried about you</em>. The rage inside her subsides. </p><p>“I know. I’m okay, Jen.”</p><p>It’s too much of a promise, but it’s not enough to reassure even herself. </p><p>“<em>Just</em>,” there’s a long sigh on the other end of the line. “<em>You don’t have to do this alone</em>.”</p><p>Again, Agatha’s breath catches. The weight of the air in her lungs feels heavier than the silence that follows the words Agatha hasn’t heard in years. Not since Jen herself had said them so many years ago, before Agatha had gotten herself into this mess. Before Agatha had chosen Ralph and her mother instead of the path she truly wanted to go down. </p><p>She’s not sure what to say. Only that she’s relieved she didn’t have to say anything at all for Jen to understand there’s a lot more at play here. She settles on something so foreign, it makes her skin sting to say it.</p><p>”Thank you,” Agatha says, her eyes stinging with unshed tears. </p><p>“<em>You’re welcome you stubborn bitch</em>,” Jen says lightheartedly and follows it up with a laugh that eases Agatha entirely. She’s so incredibly grateful Jen knows how to read the room. If nothing else, she’s outstanding at that. </p><p>With nothing else to say, Jen excuses herself back to her Sunday and leaves Agatha to her day.</p><p>Upon hanging up with Jen, Agatha responds back to Alice’s message.</p><p>She ignores Ralph’s.</p><p>And just like everything these last couple of weeks, Sunday blends into Monday as if they were one and the same. Ralph comes home in that timeframe and Agatha doesn’t mention his absence and Ralph doesn’t mention his unanswered text.</p><p>There’s an understanding. </p><p>There’s also an understanding that Agatha has to face Rio in their first professional setting since the bar when she now knows what the intern sounds like when she comes. And if it’s not the sweetest sounds she’s ever heard. It’s addicting—one of those excerpts you play in your head constantly as you’re doing mundane things throughout the day. So of course it’s on a loop when Agatha crosses through the doors of her building.  </p><p>“<em>God yes,” Rio cries. “Give it to me.”</em></p><p>She hits the button to her floor. </p><p>“<em>Please make me come, Agatha. I’m so close.”</em></p><p>Her legs squeeze together. </p><p>“<em>I’m coming—I’m coming—I’m—fuck</em>.”</p><p><em>Ding</em>—The elevator doors open and Agatha steps through the threshold on shaky legs.</p><p>She told herself she was prepared—that there wasn’t anything she couldn’t handle. She’d been 30 years old and the only woman in a room full of 50 year old men and she'd chewed them up and spit them out. She could be that person again—she still is. Except this time it feels like the roles are reversed and she’s the one that needs to be put in check because if she sees Rio again while she’s in this mood, she’s signing the dotted line on her severance package because there’s no way she’s not taking her on sight. </p><p>When the doors open to her floor, she feels infinitely better. She commands this space here. She’s in her element. She greets Wanda as she passes and settles behind her desk like she never left. If she makes a pointed effort to avoid any intern interaction then that’s nobody’s business but her own. </p><p>But it’s not long into her workday that there’s a knock on her door and she looks up to see Rio waiting intently outside. She’s got a laptop in her hand and a coffee carrier with two beverages in the other. When Agatha waves her in, she takes a deep breath. Rio enters the space like she normally does. You wouldn’t know she’d been crying out over Agatha’s fingers less than 48 hours ago, but that knowledge is for Agatha and Rio alone. </p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes, sitting up straight in her chair and crossing a leg over the other. “Yes, Miss Vidal?”</p><p>Rio smiles with a glint in her eye. “Good morning Ms. Harkness. Would you mind looking over this email for me? I’ve brought you a coffee as a pre-thank you.”</p><p>She offers out the carrier with the drinks in it and Agatha eyes it cautiously before wrapping her delicate fingers around the larger one. Rio smiles knowingly, and places the carrier down all together before sliding over the laptop to the CEO.</p><p>Agatha watches as Rio slowly rounds the desk, her fingers tapping along the surface as she moves. She steps into Agatha’s personal space, leaving barely any room for comfort as she leans forward towards the desk, opening her laptop. Agatha’s breath hitches as she’s faced with her first obstacle of the day. Rio is basically arching over her, ass near inches from her face as she clicks away on her laptop to pull up the email that Agatha surely isn’t even remotely thinking about anymore. </p><p>Rio had opted for a deep green dress today, her tan legs seemingly stretching for miles under the fabric and as Agatha gives them a once over, she’s reminded of when they were wrapped around her hips. She wonders what it would feel like now to have them in that same position, but the butt of Rio’s heel digging into her as she thrust. </p><p>She clears her throat. “What are you doing?”</p><p>Rio turns to look at her over her shoulder but makes no move to change her position otherwise, “Showing you the email?”</p><p>“<em>Just</em> the email?”</p><p>“Why do you see something else?”</p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes, watching as the close proximity between them unfolds another level of tension inside her that she had only just gotten her grip on. </p><p>“Just tell me why you’d like me to review it? Are you not capable of crafting something on your own?”</p><p>Rio laughs, “I’m more than capable of taking care of things on my own, I just think I’d like your approval.” </p><p>“I know what you’re doing,” Agatha sets her jaw. “You only have to ask.”</p><p>“I’m not sure what you’re implying,” Rio says, but her tone says otherwise. Her eyes dip to Agatha’s lips just a foot away from hers. She licks them before pulling her bottom lip between her teeth. “I’m just simply asking for some guidance.”</p><p>Agatha pauses for a moment as if pondering over a thought. To Rio—or anyone else—it may look like she’s deliberating on giving her attention to the email or not. That’s not even close to the scope of what’s crossing Agatha’s mind. “Okay, Miss Vidal. Though, I’ve forgotten my reading glass at home, can you read over it for me. I’ll listen to the best of my ability?”</p><p>Rio licks her lips, eyes widening before she turns back to her laptop. “Uh—sure. It’s an email for…”</p><p>Whatever she says falls on deaf ears as Agatha lets her free left hand drop below her desk and wrap around the backside of Rio’s leg. The girl tenses for a moment, her words freezing.</p><p>“Don’t make a face, understood,” There’s a whimper, “That’s not an answer, Rio.”</p><p>Agatha can see the younger woman take a deep breath. “Understood.”</p><p>“Good,” The CEO compliments. “Now continue.”</p><p>Rio’s voice is raspy as she starts over, but she quickly clears it as though to avoid looking as desperate as she feels. Agatha slowly and agonizingly moves her fingers against the now raised skin of Rio’s inner right leg. She’s crossing the threshold of her thigh when Rio shifts her stance wider and Agatha smiles to herself. </p><p>Rio’s still reading to the best of her ability while Agatha listens in completely—not only to her words but to the sounds of her breath hitching in her throat. When the CEO starts nearing the point of no return, she moves her fingers one last inch before she’s pressing against the font of Rio’s underwear—which is impressively wet.</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em> you’re soaked, Rio,” Agatha hisses as she cuts Rio off mid sentence, but the intern doesn’t seem to mind why the way she rocks into Agatha’s touch. “You want this?”</p><p>Rio nods. “<em>Yes</em>.”</p><p>“Yes, what,” Agatha toys, her fingers starting to push the inside seam of Rio’s underwear aside. </p><p>“Yes, <em>please</em>.” </p><p>“Then don’t stop reading. You stop, I <em>fucking</em> stop. Start over.”</p><p>Rio starts reading again and Agatha swipes against her folds with her index finger to test the younger girl's patience. Her face falters for a moment at the contact, but she gathers her composure quickly. Agatha rewards her with another swipe, this one pressing harder and moving faster. Her composure still holds up. </p><p>“So good,” Agatha cooes.</p><p>Rio lets a shaky chuckle leave her lips. “You’re not even listening to me.”</p><p>“I can multitask," Agatha retorts, her fingers moving upwards to the younger girl's swollen nub as she starts to move counter clockwise against the spot. “Now if you can still talk back to me, you must be able to handle a little more, darling.”</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>,” Is Rio’s desperate response and Agatha chuckle’s lowly.</p><p>“That’s not appropriate email language I’m afraid.”</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Agatha asks as she stops her motion. The way Rio whimpers at the loss doesn’t go unnoticed. “Are you in any position to be talking back to me right now? Last I checked, it’s your pleasure that’s in the palm of my hand—not vice versa.”</p><p>Rio whines and rocks her hips down to try to reach Agatha’s retracted fingers. The CEO <em>tsks</em> her tongue. “Look at how <em>desperate</em> you are. That doesn’t look like a woman in control to me.”</p><p>“You’re right,” comes Rio’s strained response. “I’m sorry. I’ll behave. Just please keep touching me. <em>Please</em>.” </p><p>When Agatha curls her fingers to reach Rio’s clit again, there’s a low moan before Rio starts reading her email again. Agatha didn't even have to direct her to. God, she’s got this woman right where she wants her—putty in her hands.</p><p>Agatha starts moving faster. She had wanted to draw this out much longer—until Rio was a whining, whimpering mess, but the knowledge that Rio had easily turned into that much quicker than she anticipated has her eager to see the intern come completely undone on her fingers… <em>again</em>. She can feel Rio’s arousal sliding against her wrist and dripping down her forearm from this angle and it’s the single most hottest thing she’s witnessed in a long time. The urge to lick it up is overwhelming as she’s not gotten to taste the raven haired girl the way she’s desperate to. The thought urges her on faster. </p><p>“And I’d like t-to—<em>fuck</em>—offer to expand your re-resources in—<em>motherfucker</em>.”</p><p>“Those are some choice words sweetheart,” Agatha toys, turning her head to take a sip of her now lukewarm coffee. It’s funny. As she’s sitting here, legs crossed at her desk, a coffee in one hand and a dripping intern in the other, she’s acutely aware of how this feeling is—without a doubt—the only thing she ever wants to feel in her entire life. </p><p>“I can’t Agatha. I <em>can’t</em>—“</p><p>“Yes you <em>can</em>. I know you <em>can</em>. You’re gonna come silently like the good girl you are.”</p><p>“I’m gonna give us away.”</p><p>“<em>No, </em>you aren’t.”</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>, Agatha.” </p><p>“Just keeping breathing,” Agatha says as she continues her pace against the swollen clit that’s all but throbbing against her hand. She can feel the way Rio’s legs are threatening to shake, her hands are clasped against the edge of the desk like a lifeline and her breathing is coming out in shallow gasps. “You’re doing <em>so</em> good—taking me in front of everyone and being so good that they don’t even know it.”</p><p>Another whine from Rio.</p><p>“I bet you would <em>love</em> being watched though. You want these people to see you come—to see the desperate <em>slut</em> for me that you are.”</p><p>“Agatha—“</p><p>“Show them Rio.”</p><p>“Oh <em>fuck</em>—“</p><p>And if the first time Agatha saw Rio come undone on her fingers was an awakening, this was the second damn coming of christ. Whispered obscenities spill from Rio’s lips as she topples over the edge. Her knees bending under the release as she staggers a little forward. Agatha continues her motions as she pushes Rio through her climax, watching the entire scene with dark, pupil-blown eyes. </p><p>When Rio comes to, she drops her head into her hands on the desk and laughs. “I think you were wrong before.”</p><p>Agatha hums as she retracts her hand from under the dress. “And what was that?”</p><p>“That I’m going to be the one to ruin you,” she says as she lifts her head to turn back to the CEO. Agatha waited for her eye contact like a calculated predator so she could bring her soaked fingers up into her own mouth and lick them clean. The moans that spills from her lips at the taste causes Rio to close her eyes and take a deep breath to steady herself. “I think it’s you that’s going to ruin me, Agatha.” </p><p>Agatha laughs, “Maybe we’ll just ruin each other. I think I like the sound of that better.”</p><p>Rio nods, her eyes entranced on Agatha’s mouth. “So when do I get to <em>ruin</em> you then?”</p><p>Agatha pauses for a second. It really, honestly hadn’t crossed her mind. She’s spent so many years without that she just didn’t feel that need like she felt the need to have Rio. Instead of saying that though, she settles for something less emotionally tethered. </p><p>“When you’ve earned it.”</p><p align="center">—</p><p>“Wanda,” Agatha calls from across her desk as she types away at some email she’s rewritten four times. </p><p>“Yes, Ms. Harkness,” comes Wanda’s immediate response as she clicks her heels through the door.  </p><p>“Could you look into finding someone to install some blinds in here? I think I’d like more privacy.”</p><p>The blinds are installed two days later.</p><p align="center">—</p><p align="left">“Hey,” Rio says as she enters Agatha’s office. “Wanda said you needed me to grab you some lunch?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha answers firmly before standing up from her desk. “Come here I’ll show you.”</p><p>Rio pads over to the CEO, eyebrows knitted in confusion but compiles nonetheless. </p><p>“Sit,” Agatha points to her desk chair and Rio’s trying her hardest to follow the plot here, but when she takes her seat and Agatha sinks to her knees in front of her, she doesn’t have any further questions—except the quick observation that there are now curtains over her once glass walls. </p><p>“There are curtains,” Rio says as she looks down into Agatha’s blues staring up at her. Agatha can’t imagine a better sight than the way Rio’s resolve crumbles almost immediately.</p><p>“Sometimes I like to <em>eat</em> in private.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes go wide as she watches Agatha slowly tear her underwear down her legs, licking her lips like she’s never been hungrier in her life. She tucks away Rio’s underwear into her pocket. </p><p>“I’ve been thinking about this since you kissed me with your come on your lips,” Agatha says like there’s never been a truer fact as she takes one of Rio’s legs and throws it over her shoulder. </p><p>Rio’s next words get swallowed in her throat as the first feeling of Agatha’s flat tongue lapping against her clit renders her completely speechless. Her head falls back and her hands grip tightly on the arms of the chair. It’s like Agatha has a second sense because without even pulling herself away or opening her eyes, she reaches up and grabs one of Rio’s hands, placing it on the back of her head. Rio takes the hint and uses her now grip on Agatha’s hair to guide the CEO along. </p><p>She comes not even five minutes later with Agatha’s name spilling from her lips and a new favorite view of the CEO. On her knees with disheveled hair, come running down her chin and a wicked smirk on her face.</p><p align="center">—</p><p>The door to the supply closet slams shut and Rio is thrown against it almost seconds later. Agatha’s lips are on hers, her knee slotted between the raven haired girl's thighs and her hands making a quick work of the button up Rio had decided to wear today. She’s maybe had it on all of three hours before it’s tucked away on the floor next to the mop bucket, followed by her bra. </p><p>Agatha’s got her mouth on her chest, tongue swirling around her right nipple while her thumb works the left and any inhibitions she had about her shirt now being dirty have left. </p><p>“Fuck—your tits are perfect.”</p><p>“Such a dirty mouth, Ms. Harkness.”</p><p>“You <em>love</em> it.”</p><p>When that mouth is attached to her center moments later—<em>I do, I do, I do</em>— leaves her mouth like a promise.</p><p align="center">—</p><p>There’s an intern meeting that Friday. Agatha’s not heading it, but she’s there and her eyes haven’t left her phone since she sat down. The—pain in her neck—merger is back in full force and she’s never had an issue with multitasking up until this point. The meeting is wrapping up and papers are shuffling before she even notices she’s missed a thing. When she searches around the room, Rio’s already look at her.</p><p>She makes an obvious point to pack her things up slowly so she’s the last to leave the room and Agatha’s already expecting some sly comment to fill the space between them before it even leaves Rio’s mouth. </p><p>“I have an idea,” is what she says and—oh—that’s different. Agatha raises her eyebrow intrigued and motions her hand for Rio to continue. The younger woman starts moving over to the CEO, hands inside of her pockets and tongue pushed against her cheek. Agatha stares up at her from her chair. “Whatever it is that’s got you wound up so tightly… <em>Use</em> me to relieve it.”</p><p>Agatha’s surprise falters for a moment when she feels her heart clench in her chest. It’s not a romantic notion in the slightest. It’s not even in the same ballpark, but for the first time, someone has noticed her. And not only that, knew exactly what she would need. She grapples with her inner self for a moment, but she lets a smile turn up her lips. She can deal with emotional realizations later, now, she’d deal with something else. </p><p>“What did you have in mind?”</p><p>Rio mirrors the smile, “Well, there’s this awfully big conference table here. It’d be a real shame if someone didn’t put it to use.”</p><p>Agatha raises an eyebrow, crossing her arms over her chest, “Yeah?”</p><p>“Oh <em>yeah,”</em> Rio toys, her hands wrapping around the sides of her blazer before she lets it fall from around her shoulders and onto the floor below. Agatha’s eyes darken as she gets a glimpse of Rio’s lack of bra through her buttoned shirt. “I just think, it’s got a great surface, you know?”</p><p>Rio turns her back to Agatha and pokes her behind out as she arches her back over the table, her hand sliding over the surface as if she’s inspecting it. </p><p>That’s how Rio ends up with her pants around her ankles and back arched over the conference room table. Agatha’s standing behind her, a fist full of Rio’s hair as she runs her hand over the smooth surface of her ass. Rio’s bracing herself against the surface, hips rocking back into Agatha’s touch. </p><p>“Let me feel that anger, Ms. Harkness,” Rio says with a grunt. </p><p>Agatha licks her lips before she removes her hand and replaces it with a smack. She feels the anger in her body start to wash over with adrenaline—with pure, unfiltered want. She lifts her hand and smacks again—harder.</p><p>“<em>Yes</em>,” Rio cries. “Harder.”</p><p>Agatha moans as she places a third slap against the cheek and sees a welling hand print form in its wake. Agatha’s been wet nearly every single time she’s been with Rio, but this is different. This power. This yearning. If Agatha let this go on long enough, she’d probably come just at the action of leaving her mark on Rio like this alone. </p><p>“Use me, Agatha. <em>Fucking</em> use me.” </p><p>And the cord in Agatha snaps. She’s pulling Rio back by her hips and flipping her over like she weighs absolutely nothing at all—fueled by pure lust and adrenaline. She’s got Rio pinned to the table by her hands pushing down on her thighs while the younger girl's nails dig into her shoulders like she can’t get a grip on anything long enough. Agatha’s lips are on Rio’s before anything in her body can protest. Rio’s tongue is sliding against her lips and Agatha welcomes the feeling instantly, tangling her own into the mix. </p><p>Rio moves a hand into her hair to grab a fist full and pull. Agatha hums into her mouth at the feeling, relishing the way Rio just knows exactly where to touch—where to feel. When their lips break and their foreheads are resting against each others as their chests heave in a rhythm, Rio whispers, “Come on Agatha, <em>fuck</em> me like you <em>hate</em> me.”</p><p>And something about Rio’s eyes—dark and hooded—as she just juts out her bottom lip. Agatha’s got her hand around her throat before she can second guess it. The look in Rio’s eyes and the soft gasp that leaves her lips tells the older woman it definitely wasn’t an unwelcome move. </p><p>“You like that, <em>yeah</em>?”</p><p>“I <em>fucking</em> love it,” Rio cries.</p><p>Agatha groans, she squeezes just a little tighter against her throat and Rio’s eyes roll into the back of her head like butter.</p><p>“I haven’t even <em>touched</em> you yet and you’re reacting like this.” Agatha says to which Rio just whimpers. “You like me controlling you like this, don’t you?”</p><p>Rio laughs, her face turning red. “As if that wasn’t <em>fucking</em> obvious, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha raises a brow before she knocks Rio’s legs apart with her hips. “Open up for me.”</p><p>And then she’s got two fingers pumping inside of her like it’s her divine purpose in life. Between the hand on Rio’s throat and the curling of Agatha’s fingers against her g spot, she’s not sure what’s going to make the younger girl finish faster. Rio’s eyes flutter shut, her mouth opening slightly and Agatha uses her hold to pull Rio’s attention back to her.</p><p>“<em>No</em>, open your eyes and look at me,” Agatha commands as she starts moving her pace faster, her thumb finding that sweet spot on Rio’s clit again. When Rio opens her eyes, they’re glossed over and wide. She’s looking into Agatha like she’s scared she might die if she doesn’t do what Agatha pleases. “Keep your eyes on me and I’ll give you everything you want. I want to see all of you when you come.”</p><p>When Rio comes, her eyes are fixed on Agatha’s like a lifeline. Agatha helps her stay there by holding her head steady in her hand, goading her to the finish line. When she lets her grip go, she slides her hand to the back of Rio’s head instead and pushes her closer in for a kiss. It’s softer than they’ve ever shared before and Agatha is acutely aware of it, but hopes it passes by in the moment.</p><p>It does.</p><p>Rio laughs when she comes to, her hands sliding up to rest on the lapels of Agatha’s blazer. She grips them lightly like she’s holding on and leans her head onto Agatha the chest. The CEO still has her hand tangled in Rio’s and finds herself scratching the back of her scalp lightly. This is certainly new, but it doesn’t feel unwelcome to Agatha’s surprise. She feels like a puzzle piece just slid into its spot somewhere in the universe. </p><p>“You have no idea what you’re doing to me, Rio,” she says as an almost whisper. It was more of an honest thought than anything else, but both women are smiling unbeknownst to the other.</p><p>When Agatha gets home that night, Ralph is cooking over the stove and he smiles at her fondly when she walks in. It makes her sick. It feels like a reminder that Rio’s not the one she comes home to. Rio’s not the one making her dinner. Rio’s not the one who put a ring around her finger. She feels like she’s suffocating. She’s been so all consumed by the younger girl that when she’s not, everything is significantly less. </p><p>She freezes from her spot across the kitchen, takes a deep breath and says the only thing that feels right, “I think we need to talk.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>“Agatha, what’s going on?”</p><p>Ralph sounds worried, but his eyes are his most obvious tell. The way they seem to lose their light the moment he turns to look at Agatha makes her take a hard swallow. He looks like he already knows what is about to happen<em>—</em>like he’s been holding his breath for fifteen years up until this very moment where everything he has been dreading is finally coming to fruition. Agatha tries to find a bone within herself that cares. She really does, but every time she looks at his face she just sees everything he isn’t and everything she can’t be.</p><p>“Can you please talk to me,” He asks again, but Agatha doesn’t make a point to answer it right away. Instead, she rounds the island in the middle of the kitchen and comes to stand in front of her fiance. He looks down at her with a frown, eyes bouncing back and forth from each of hers. Maybe he’s searching for a reason too. She sighs and tucks a stand of hair behind her ear nervously. </p><p>“Are you happy, Ralph? Like <em> genuinely </em>happy,” She asks, her eyes finding him this time and he unsurprisingly starts to avoid hers by looking down at his feet before bouncing them back up to hers. “Could you feel this way for the rest of your life?”</p><p>He knits his brows together, blinking a few times. “I don't understand what you–”</p><p>“Oh, cut the crap. You know <em> exactly </em>what I’m asking you,” Agatha sighs, throwing her hands around in the air as she slaps them down onto her thighs in defeat. “Are you happy in this relationship? Do you still want to marry me?”</p><p>He shakes his head, sighing as he pinches the bridge of his nose. “Do you really want to do this Agatha–”</p><p>“When should we do this then?”</p><p>“I <em> mean, </em>do you really want to fuck everything up?”</p><p>“Oh I’m gonna fuck everything up, <em> huh</em>,” Agatha grits her teeth. “You know what’s <em> fucked </em>up? Spending twenty years of my life in a sexless, passionless relationship, Ralph.”</p><p>“And that’s just <em> my </em>fault,” he asks as he bares down his teeth. “It takes two to tango, Agatha.”</p><p>She rolls her eyes. “That’s funny. Most of our <em> tango </em>was very one sided.”</p><p>“<em>Ah</em>, there it is,” Ralph steps closer, closing the distance between them. “Suddenly <em> now </em>is the time that this is a problem for you?”</p><p>“What do you mean by that?”</p><p>“I mean,” he takes a deep breath, inhaling through his nose. “You suddenly stop staying for dinner. You’re going out with Jen—drinking and coming back in after one in the morning. You hide away in your office at every given opportunity. You basically disappear from <em> our </em> life and then weeks later you decide this isn’t working for you. You’ve had <em> years </em> to bring this up. I’m connecting the dots Agatha–”</p><p>“You aren’t connecting shit–”</p><p>“I am,” Ralph cries, his fists closing and unclosing by his side as his eyes begin to well up with tears. It’s the most vulnerable she’s seen him in a long time. She doesn’t care.</p><p>“Please, <em> enlighten </em> me then, Ralph,” Agatha sighs. “What is your grand conclusion?”</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>It’s simple. Three words, but Agatha feels her entire world shatter beneath her feet. She tries to hold her facial expressions in, but she’s never been good at hiding from him no matter how distant they become.</p><p>“What,” She asks, but her voice comes out unsteady. He notices immediately, stepping closer to her as he looks down onto her, making her feel small. Out of everything he could’ve said or done, this action cut the deepest.</p><p>“<em>Who,</em>” he pauses. “Is it?”       </p><p>This is it. This is the moment where Agatha can lay it all out and tell him there <em> is </em> someone else. That whatever this is between them can’t be saved or fixed. They’ve had their time and they couldn’t make it work. But she stops herself with a quick thought because, <em> is there really someone else? </em> Can Rio even be called that? They fuck. That’s the extent of whatever is going on between them, but Agatha would be lying to herself if she said she hadn’t given a thought to what it would be like to have that feeling always. To be able to have Rio whenever she wanted. The ability to chase that is in the palm of her hands, but is she doing this for herself or for Rio?</p><p>“You’re not doing a great job of selling me on your point,” Ralph comments amidst her silence. His arms cross against his chest. Agatha looks up at him—<em>really</em> looks at him. She tries to understand what she saw in him so many years ago. What that version of herself had wanted. Would that version of her still want this? Would she be disappointed? So much of the build up to this conversation has been built off of her high emotions. </p><p>“You know what,” He folds his hands in front of him, “Take the next week. Figure your shit out, Agatha. I’d like some <em> actual </em> explanations.”</p><p>Agatha snaps out of her thoughts, but lets her shoulders relax almost immediately, “Okay.”</p><p>Agatha sits alone at the table with her head in her hands as he packs a few bags. She watches him angrily shove and snatch things, muttering curses under his breath, but she doesn’t engage. When he throws his bag over his shoulder and heads towards the door she doesn’t ask him where he’s going and he doesn’t share. He leaves without a goodbye and she doesn’t find herself missing one.</p><p>After she’s deliberated to herself for a couple of minutes, she decides to call in some reinforcements to help her through this ‘crisis,’ though it really doesn’t feel like one. Maybe moral support is what she’s after instead? <em> Yeah</em>, that word feels more appropriate.</p><p>When she picks up her phone, the first person that comes to her mind is Jen and her ability to call Agatha out on her shit like it’s her full time job. She could use some of that right now. With Jen’s contact information being one of the most recents to pop up, she hits her name and waits two rings before her best friend's voice filters over the phone. </p><p>“Jen, I’m sending Christian to pick you up. Bring a bottle of wine and some patience. See you in a few.”</p><p align="center">—</p><p>Jen shows up not even an hour later nursing <em> two </em> bottles of wine, one in each hand when Agatha opens the door. </p><p>“This is probably much cheaper than the shit you buy, but it’s gonna fuck you up all the same so—“</p><p>“I don’t care,” Agatha says as she snatches one of the bottles and heads to the kitchen to find her corkscrew. </p><p>“I always forget how fucking rich you are,” Jen says as she enters the apartment. <em> Well </em>—penthouse. Agatha wouldn’t ever call it that. To her it’s just home, but when people who aren’t used to her space visit, she becomes acutely aware of just how normalized everything’s become for her. </p><p>Her home is <em> definitely </em> not normal. She’s got a two floor penthouse with floor to ceiling windows revealing a skyline view of the Hudson on the Brooklyn side. Her kitchen is industrial, gas stovetop, double doored fridge—the nines. Her living room is shrouded in massive gallery walls and shelves filled with impressive book and record collections. Her ceilings are high, the space is clean and polished and ten thousand percent Agatha. Without Ralph’s presence, you wouldn’t even know he lives here. </p><p>She laughs at Jen’s comment as she retrieves the cork from the bottle and fetches two glasses from her cabinets. When she returns to find Jen stretched out across her sectional, she shakes her head fondly.</p><p>“<em>Sure</em>, make yourself at home why don’t ya…”</p><p>“I’m just settling in to wind up the biggest ‘I told you so’ of my life,” Jen laughs as she reaches out for her glass. Agatha hands it over with a scoff, but tucks herself into the corner of the couch adjacent from her best friend. “<em>So</em>?” </p><p>Jen takes a sip from her wine glass, peering over it at Agatha intently as the CEO takes a quick sigh. </p><p>“Ralph gave me some space,” Agatha starts. “Things are just… lacking, I guess?”</p><p>“<em>Lacking</em>,” She parrots Agatha, to which the CEO just nods in affirmation. “You mean you aren’t having sex—or <em> good </em> sex?”</p><p>Agatha slaps a hand over her face and groans. She lets her neck fall back against the arm of the couch behind her. </p><p>“Okay so, no sex,” Jen asks, to which Agatha just groans again. “Okay, let’s use our words here. You’re <em> not </em> having sex?”</p><p>Agatha pulls her head back up and finds Jen’s eyes. “No sex. No kissing. No touching. Zero, zip, <em> nada</em>.”</p><p>“<em>Oh</em>,” Jen reacts. Agatha expected worse honestly. “This makes so much sense. No wonder you’re so <em> damn </em> hateful.”</p><p>“Shut up,” Agatha says with a laugh as she kicks her foot out to softly nudge against Jen. Her best friend goes to avoid it and nearly spills her wine across the floor. She gasps, tucking the glass of wine into herself as if she’s protecting it.</p><p>“This is exactly what I’m talking about. So <em> aggressive</em>.”</p><p>Agatha sighs, tucking her knees against her chest. “Your logic doesn’t make sense.”</p><p>“I think it’s a known fact that intimacy makes you nicer—happier even.”</p><p>“Just because I’m not <em> sleeping </em> with Ralph doesn’t mean I’m not <em> sleeping </em> with anyone at all.”</p><p>Jen stops for a moment, her head turning as she pieces something together. She closes her eyes and sets her jaw. “Agatha…”</p><p>“Jen…”</p><p>“Don’t tell me—“</p><p>“I haven’t said anything.”</p><p>“—you’re sleeping with <em> that </em> bartender…”</p><p>Agatha pauses, pulling at her lips with her fingers. It’s a nervous tick. Jen narrows her eyes. </p><p>“Agatha, she’s like <em> twenty five</em>!”</p><p>“I didn’t confirm or deny! You told me not to speak,” Agatha defends, an accusatory finger pointing in Jen’s direction. The other woman swats it away.</p><p>Jen sits up tall, on hand thrown over the back of the couch as the other one sloshes her wine glass haphazardly. “You didn’t have to you <em> fucking </em> cougar.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes are locked on the glass. “Firstly, you spill that wine on this couch and I’ll be wiping your entire savings clean to cover it. <em> Secondly</em>,” The CEO rolls her eyes, “I’m definitely not drunk enough for this.”</p><p>Agatha goes to grab the bottle of wine off the coffee table next to her to replenish her glass, but Jen is the one to swat at her hand this time. Agatha looks down at her hand, raising an eyebrow towards her best friend, but Jen isn’t affected by the threat in the slightest. She brushes it off, “Okay so you cheated on Ralph with a woman, big deal. We all know you’re a repressed lesbian anyways.” </p><p>“Jen,” Agatha exclaims. </p><p>“<em>What</em>,” Jen laughs. “Do I need to remind you of our college days? If you could get women pregnant you’d have at least fifty children existing purely out of spite right now.”</p><p>Agatha laughs and it’s the first genuine one she’s felt leave her chest in a long, long time. College her is definitely someone she’d like to see again. She can’t recall a time in her life where she felt so… herself. Jen just stares at her like she’s staring right through. Her face is resting against her fist as she props it up against the back of the couch.</p><p>Agatha shakes her eyes from side to side as if asking ‘<em>what</em>?’ Jen’s just shaking her head in disbelief, a pitying smile on her lips as she asks, “Is she at least <em> good </em>in bed?”</p><p>There’s no hesitation in Agatha’s answer, “<em>So </em> good, Jen.”</p><p>“Ha! I fucking <em> knew </em> it,” Jen exclaims, throwing and accusing finger at Agatha. “Must be fucking spectacular if you’re ending your relationship over her.”</p><p>“Okay <em> woah</em>. It’s not over her. Jen, it's just…” Agatha sighs, her head falling to rest in her free hand as she leans back against the arm of the couch behind her. “You know why it never worked with Ralph, Jen. I’m not… I’m not <em>that.”</em></p><p>Jen doesn’t dare interrupt, but she offers a reassuring nod. Agatha doesn’t see it save for the way she’s staring into her lap like it might open up and swallow her whole. Despite the wrenching in her chest, she continues. </p><p>“I didn’t want her. <em>Fuck</em>, I tried to avoid it, but I—Rio was just so unexpected. She’s not like anyone I’ve ever met. She knows what I need <em> exactly </em> when I need it, without me so much as hinting at it. She came into my office on day one and since then, I’ve felt more myself than I have in a while. I’ve felt <em>okay</em> with being myself. She's helped me find that again.”</p><p>“Wait, <em> pause</em>,” Jen holds up her hand. “She came into your office?”</p><p>Huge, <em> colossal </em> fuck up. Agatha takes her hand away, scrunches her face with a tight smile on her lips as she grimaces. “Did I mention she’s also my intern?”</p><p>Jen stares blankly, “What the <em> fuck</em>, Agatha?” </p><p>“I know, Jen. <em> God—</em>I fucking know, but before you grill into me, there’s nothing you can say that I haven’t already said myself.”</p><p>“What about, <em> You’re a fucking idiot?</em>”</p><p>“Yep.”</p><p>“This is gonna end badly.”</p><p>“<em>Mhmm</em>.”</p><p>“You should stop.”</p><p>“Well, I’ve only halfway considered <em> that </em> one.”</p><p>“Of course, you horny <em>freak</em>,” Jen says, but her tone is playful. “So, you see your intern and you sleep with her—what… a handful of times and you’re ready to uproot your entire relationship over it?”</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“Her name is Rio.”</p><p>“Okay then,” Jen blinks towards Agatha, shaking her head to rid the confusion as she notices the CEO disregards her entire point. She then tries to reword it to, “So you see <em> Rio </em> and it’s love at first sight or something? Why is this the final straw?”</p><p>Agatha sighs, her free hand coming up to reach around her neck and press against the pinch that’s starting to form there. She shakes her head as she releases her hold and sits up a little taller. She pauses for a moment as if pondering the thought. She’s never been one to believe in soulmates, twin flames, or any of that cosmic nonsense. And <em> love</em>? It’s been a month. If anything, Rio was definitely lust at first sight. She just repressed that for a few weeks before it’d gotten the best of her and ultimately spiraled out of control in a public restroom of all places. </p><p>“Love is not the right word. It’s like—” Agatha speaks out loud as she remains wrapped up inside of her thoughts. She takes a sip of her wine and fondles the glass in her hand before she settles on something that seems satisfactory. “It’s like I’m twenty three and still in college and no time has passed. I just feel like… <em>me</em>. I finally feel okay with being me. And Rio, <em>fuck—</em>she’s just… so <em> fucking </em> intense. She looks at me with this <em>wanting</em> that I can feel in my bones. She doesn’t ask me to change—only to embrace what I have been told to hide. Had she not been courageous enough to be curious… I’d probably be going to sleep next to Ralph right now.”</p><p>There’s a heavy silence between them as Jen looks onto Agatha like she’s just found the last piece to the puzzle she’d been trying to complete for months under the couch cushion. It reminds the CEO of Rio—just like everything is starting to. Agatha wants to deflect and make a comment about how she was just kidding and this dollar tree wine is making her hallucinate, but she doesn’t. She sits in the silence she’s created and holds her breath for Jen’s ever-critical response. It doesn’t come. Whatever her best friend has decided, she’s keeping it to herself for now. Agatha doesn’t know whether to be scared or relieved.</p><p>“So what now,” Jen says a little later after the silence has marinated and their wine glasses are a little emptier. “What happens with Ralph?”</p><p>Agatha huffs, “I can’t stay, Jen.”</p><p>“And with Rio?”</p><p>The CEO rolls her eyes, “Jen, I’m forty <em> fucking </em> three. This isn’t some silly crush. It’s just sex.”</p><p>Her best friend raises an eyebrow, clearly not convinced. “Are you sure?”</p><p>Agatha hates that the first word that crosses her mind is ‘no.’ You don’t just casually look to end your twenty year relationship after you make a girl in her twenties come a couple of times while cheating on your fiance. Instead she says;</p><p>“Positive.”</p><p>“But it’s okay if it’s not,” Jen’s quiet voice stills the blood surging through Agatha’s veins. Her best friend’s gaze could cut through ice, her eyes strong and soft simultaneously. “I need you to know that.”</p><p>Agatha can only find it within herself to nod and empty the contents of her wine glass with purpose. </p><p align="center">—</p><p>They are about three wine bottles deep—they had another one delivered—and have agreed that anything that surfaces from this point forward cannot be upheld as the truth after they sober up. That’s how the CEO finds out Jen and Alice have slept together. Not just once, but four times—completely platonic. Jen says it’s nice to have a release every once in a while and tells her to call Rio to get her attitude in check. Agatha reveals she hasn’t let Rio <em> touch </em> her yet and—<em>of course</em>—Jen hasn’t let it slide in the ten minutes that have passed since she aired that out.</p><p>
<em> “You mean to tell me you haven’t even orgasmed with this woman and you’re this torn up. Her pussy must be hea—“ </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Okay, Jen!” </em>
</p><p>Somewhere along the line, the bottles are emptied followed by their wine glasses and social meters. Agatha tells Jen to sleep in the guest room and her best friend is running to it before she can even finish her sentence, yelling about satin sheets and a king size mattress. Agatha laughs to herself as the sound of Jen gets more and more distant, eventually hiding behind a shut door. She sighs, feeling a weight come off of her shoulders by just having someone listen. Even if Jen calls her crazy and makes her question things she’d rather stab her eyes out than acknowledge, she feels more okay than she has in a long time. </p><p>As she walks herself up to her room, something pings in the back of her mind and she can't find a reason to ignore it anymore. Maybe it’s the wine. Maybe it’s the lack of a Ralph sized blocker, but something in her stomach is settling low and deep. It feels a lot like <em> lust</em>. She thinks about Jen’s reaction to the fact Rio hadn’t <em> touched </em> her yet—made her <em> come </em> yet and when she lets that thought sit for a minute, her body starts to tingle. Before she’d talked to Ralph, it felt wrong–like if she gave Rio access to that part of herself then she couldn’t ever recover from that. But now? Now it just feels like the end of the rope she’d been climbing up this entire time. </p><p>Before she can talk herself out of it, she calls Rio. </p><p>When Rio picks up, she sounds confused. “Hello?”</p><p>Agatha hums at the sound of Rio’s voice mixed with pumping background music. “Miss me?”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio questions and it sounds like she makes a b-line for some place quieter because the music dulls out. “Is everything okay?”</p><p>“Why wouldn’t it be?”</p><p>“Well, we’re not exactly on a phone call basis,” Rio laughs and Agatha finds herself unknowingly smiling at the sound.</p><p>“Well now we can be,” Agatha confirms as she launches herself onto her mattress and lays on her back to look up at the ceiling like some giddy teen in the eighties on the phone with their situationship they definitely don’t have feelings for. She thinks about what it would be like to be looking up at Rio from this angle right now.</p><p>“Where’s this coming from,” Rio’s voice attempts to unknowingly break her thoughts, but it doesn’t.</p><p>“I was just thinking about you,” Full steam ahead, Agatha decides.</p><p>She can hear Rio’s sharp intake of breath from the other side as an almost sultry laugh leaves her. Agatha can imagine her poking her tongue against her cheek and offering her wicked little smirk. “Yeah? How so? What was I doing?”</p><p>It’s Agatha’s turn to laugh. “That mind of yours is going to get you in trouble, Miss Vidal” </p><p>“I think like the sound of that,” Her voice is low and raspy. It hits Agatha right where it hurts.</p><p>There’s a brief silence as they settle into this new feeling. It’s the first time they’ve talked that hasn’t been face to face. The CEO having to imagine what Rio looks like as she talks to her isn’t helping the feeling in her stomach at all, though, she isn’t entirely opposed to it. </p><p>“What are you doing,” comes Rio’s voice and <em> is that a line? </em> It definitely sounds like a <em> line</em>.</p><p>Agatha settles for a neutral response despite her wanting to carry this down a very different direction. “Getting ready for bed. Jen came over… we had some drinks.”</p><p>“Is ‘some drinks’ code for multiple bottles of wine?”</p><p>“It scares me how well you’re starting to know me,” Agatha says. “But we went light this time. Only three.”</p><p>Rio hums, “That explains the random phone call then. I wouldn’t expect <em> sober </em>you to be so brave.”</p><p>“You’re probably right, but I like the way tipsy me thinks a little more.”</p><p>“Oh yeah? What is tipsy you thinking about,” There is that insinuation again and as if a thread inside the older woman snaps, she goes for the gold. What has she got to lose here?</p><p>“You. Touching me.”</p><p>She can hear Rio breathe sharply again and she smiles to herself at the intended reaction. “<em>Oh</em>. You must be <em> so </em>much more than tipsy.”</p><p>Agatha frowns. “Why? Because I have to be drunk to want you to fuck me?”</p><p>“<em>Agatha…</em>” It’s a warning. Agatha hears it loud and clear, but she’s never been good at listening to those anyways.</p><p>“I’m serious, Rio. I’ve been thinking about it.”</p><p>Rio flat out groans over the line and Agatha loses all grip on herself after that. She needs this woman. It’s so bad.</p><p>“<em>God</em>, I have too. You have no Idea.”</p><p>“Then come show me,” it comes out as a whine and Agatha curses the alcohol for making her feel and sound this desperate.</p><p>“Is this a booty call,” Rio asks and it’s most likely meant as a joke, but the excitement in her tone can’t be missed.</p><p>“You can call it whatever you want so long as your hands are on me in the next ten minutes. I’ll send Christian.”</p><p>“Woah Agatha. Slow down. I’m at work.”  </p><p>“It’s like one in the morning,” Agatha says as if she doesn’t know where the younger woman spends most of her nights.</p><p>“And I have a job that requires me to be out at that time,” Rio answers immediately, but she pauses for a moment as if pondering the thought for a moment. “What about, Ralph?”</p><p>Agatha smiles, she’s hooked. “He’s out for the week.”</p><p>“Jen?”</p><p>“Out like a light.”</p><p>“And this can’t wait until Monday?”</p><p>“The first time you touch me isn’t going to be in a supply closet. It’s going to be in a bed where I can be as loud as I want to,” Agatha says. “And <em> no</em>, it can’t wait.” </p><p>And that’s how Rio ends up at Agatha’s penthouse at one thirty am after a fifteen minute ride with Christian. When the CEO opens the door, she braces herself for a snide comment or two, but she doesn’t receive any. Instead Rio wastes absolutely no time in getting her lips on the Agatha’s in a kiss that knocks the wind out of her. She catches the younger woman in her arms, but they stumble back a bit and knock into the center table in the middle of the entryway. </p><p>When they make contact with the edge of it, their kiss breaks just long enough for Agatha to scold Rio, “I have a guest. Can you reel it back a bit?”</p><p>Rio laughs, but it’s dry and desperate. “You have no idea how much I want you, Agatha—How long I’ve been waiting for this.”</p><p>“Really, darling? I couldn’t tell,” Agatha toys, but Rio dives forward to attach her lips onto Agatha’s neck and the CEO’s train of thought goes out of the window as the younger woman starts to place hot, open mouthed kisses down the trail of her jaw. Rio’s got one hand cupping the side of her jaw, the other on the small of her back and Agatha starts to feel dizzy. She finds the back of Rio’s head and digs her fingers into the back of her scalp to ground herself but it just encourages the action further. </p><p>Rio hums at the feeling and hovers her lips just outside of Agatha’s ear as she whispers, “I could take you right here.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes roll into the back of her head as the moan that leaves her lips gets swallowed by Rio’s yet again. It’s rough. The sounds of spit and groans echo through the entryway, but all Agatha can hear is the pumping of her rapidly beating heart. </p><p>Rio starts to tug at the bottom of the older woman’s shirt and it’s over her head in seconds. When Rio notices the lack of a bra, she all but whimpers as she reaches out and cups both of them in her hands, running her thumbs over the nipples there to pull a deep moan out of the CEO’s throat. </p><p>“You’re so fucking beautiful, Agatha. <em> Holy shit</em>,” Rio says as she glances over the older woman’s midsection in awe. Something pulls in Agatha’s chest and things suddenly feel really, <em> really </em> hot, but then Rio has her lips reattached to the swell of Agatha’s right breast like a magnet and her mind goes blank. </p><p>Agatha feels like she could finish right now. There hasn’t been a time in twenty years where she’s felt so desired—so <em> wanted </em> and looking down into Rio’s dark eyes as she sucks a dark purple mark into her chest, there’s no doubt in her mind about it. She’s always cared about power—about being on top, but something about Rio claiming her like this makes something inside of her shift. She almost feels more powerful because of it.</p><p>She can feel the arousal coating the inside of her thighs because she has also decided to forgo underwear underneath her sweats and she can’t wait to see Rio’s reaction to that. There’s a tight pull in her stomach and a want so visceral that the thought of walking to her room feels like an undertaking. </p><p>Before she changes her mind, she breaks their kiss and whispers against Rio’s lips, “Get on your knees.” </p><p>There’s a puff of breath that hits Agatha’s lips before Rio leans back and connects their eyes. “What about the bed?”</p><p>“We’ve got plenty of time,” Agatha places a hand on Rio’s shoulder and guides her down to her knees. Rio looks up at her the entire time, tongue wetting her lips at the sight of Agatha bare center glistening just inches away. Rio’s hands curl around the waist band of the older woman's sweats as she pulls them down with her. “Now show me what I’ve been missing, <em> big boy.</em>”</p><p>When her knees hit the floor, she yanks Agatha’s sweats off the rest of the way and flings them back towards the door where they smack against the wood with a thump. The CEO raises an eyebrow, but it’s quickly put back in it’s place when her leg is thrown over Rio’s shoulder and the younger woman’s tongue takes an experimental wipe through her folds. </p><p>Both women moan together, but Agatha’s echoes the loudest. The older woman’s hands are gripping the edge of the table with so much force she swears she hears the wood crack. </p><p>“You taste so good, <em> baby.</em>”</p><p>Okay, ‘baby.’ That’s new and to Agatha’s surprise, it’s not entirely unwelcome. In fact, she’s certain she wants to hear it again, <em> but </em> right now, she wants to feel Rio more. She threads her fingers through Rio’s dark tresses and pushes her forward into her center with a forceful tug. Rio wastes absolutely no time in getting to work. She’s lapping at Agatha like she’s been starved for months. The moans toppling out of the older woman are filthy and uncontrollable as Agatha feels herself losing her grip on Rio’s head, her body moving completely on autopilot. The droves of pleasure overtaking her are overwhelming as Rio’s onslaught of movements against her clit take precedence. </p><p>“Holy <em> fuck</em>,” is all the older woman can say as she lets the younger woman completely devour her against the <em> rocking </em> table.</p><p>She can feel her orgasm approaching like a searing burn of wet heat building up in her core. She tries to grab hold of Rio’s head—the edge of the table—covering her own mouth—but nothing seems like enough as she feels herself approaching the sweet, sweet edge. It takes one last circular motion of Rio’s tongue to send an onslaught of curses from the older woman’s mouth as she comes almost not even five minutes since the woman began. </p><p>Rio keeps at her center through the aftershocks, keeping Agatha’s thighs in place. When Rio pulls back, her mouth glistening just as bright as the look in her eyes, she smirks up to the older woman like she knows what she’s done. Agatha looks down at her and she feels like she could come again at the sight. </p><p>“What the ever loving <em>fuck… </em>was that,” She’s breathless–chest heaving. </p><p>Rio laughs and goes to make a move to stand up, but Agatha is quick to usher her back down to her knees. </p><p>“Nuh uh,” she shakes her head, smiling. “You are <em> never </em> leaving from down there. <em> Ever.</em>”</p><p>Rio raises an eyebrow. “Be careful what you wish for.”</p><p>Agatha learns quickly that Rio never backs down from a challenge because not only does she come again, but as she's riding the aftershocks of the second earth shattering orgasm she’s received in the last five minutes, Rio refuses to let up from frantic movements with her tongue and sends the older woman spiraling down into another orgasm seconds later. With her legs shaking around Rio’s head, her nails making lasting marking on the younger woman’s scalp, she pulls Rio’s head from its place with a sharp tug. </p><p>Rio looks up to her with a smile, her tongue licking up the mess around her lips when Agatha says, “This… is utterly <em> humiliating.</em>”</p><p>“I won’t tell if you don’t” Rio says with a laugh, but Agatha just pulls her to stand up by her grip on the back of the younger woman’s head. She lets out a soft groan at the feeling, but Agatha swallows it whole by crushing her lips against the raven haired girl’s. When she tastes herself on Rio’s lips, a frenzy unlike anything she’s ever experienced begins and she starts to wonder just how anyone could ever stop having sex when it feels like this. </p><p>“Oh, you are going to get me in so much trouble,” Agatha whispers against her lips, a smiling following soon after.</p><p>“I hope that’s a promise, Ms. Harkness,” Rio places a small peck against her lips as she answers. “Now take me to your bed.”</p><p>When they stumble into Agatha’s bedroom, Rio’s halfway unclothed as her shirt is discarded somewhere down the hallway and her jeans are hanging loosely around her thighs. Their lips are molded together, hands searching over all the available skin of one another as they backpedal their way to the mattress. Rio’s legs hit the bed first and she lets herself fall back into it, pulling Agatha down with her. When Agatha’s bare chest falls down onto Rio’s, both women moan at the feeling of their bare skin touching for the first time.</p><p>“You’re so <em> fucking </em>hot, Rio,” Agatha moans as she leans down to reconnect their lips together. The feeling of the younger woman’s nails digging into her back keeps her grounded because she swears none of this is real. There is no way she’s deprived herself of this for so long. “Are you even fucking real?”</p><p>Rio laughs, “Are <em> you </em>real?”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head. Sure, it was a joke, but the way Rio makes her head spin is so unfamiliar it scares her shitless, “You don’t understand. I’ve never—<em>fuck</em>— You make me feel—”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>It’s simple, but Agatha understands because Rio <em> understands</em>. </p><p>Agatha kisses her. It’s slower than any other time they’ve kissed, but neither woman takes note of it—too wrapped up in the feeling of the other. Rio’s rocking her hips up against the older woman’s stomach in a silent pleading to be taken care of and Agatha would normally make this drawn out, but she finds herself needing Rio in that way, just as much as Rio needs her.</p><p>Agatha trails her hand down Rio’s stomach until she settles it in between her thighs, swiping her ring and middle finger through Rio’s built up arousal before she pushes them into the younger woman’s wet heat. She watches Rio’s face as she slips them in, her eyes rolling back into her head as her mouth goes slack. The gasp that leaves Rio’s mouth has Agatha biting down on her tongue. She uses her hips for leverage as she thrusts into Rio hard and fast, relishing in the way she whimpers at each movement.</p><p>“You feel so fucking good,” Rio whines as she digs into Agatha’s back, her legs wrapping around the older woman’s waist. </p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha toys, a smile on her lips. “You’re taking me <em> so </em>good. Can you do more? I bet you can.”</p><p>Rio nods rapidly, trapping her bottom lip between her teeth as Agatha adds another finger. They both moan at the feeling of Rio stretching around her extra digit and the sounds of her fingers working in and out of her slick heat. Agatha keeps rocking into her with as much force as she can muster—running on pure hunger and adrenaline as she watches Rio’s body start to lose control of itself. </p><p>“That’s it.” Agatha whispers breathlessly. “You’re almost there.”</p><p>Rio whines, her eyes falling shut as she pulls Agatha tighter towards her for some support. Agatha tucks her nose into the side of the younger woman’s head and whispers an onslaught of praises as Rio cracks like a whip and comes on her fingers almost instantly. Agatha slows her pace, but continues to rock into the raven haired girl as she rides her high. “So good. You did <em> so </em>good.”</p><p>Rio takes a deep intake of breath before she opens her eyes to look back into the blues hovering above her. If Agatha’s breath hitches when they make contact, she blames it on exhaustion. She rolls over to lay beside Rio, both of them laying on their backs, looking up at the ceiling. Agatha doesn’t want to open her mouth and ruin the moment, but she feels like she needs to say something like <em> thank you for that incredible, earth shattering fuck. </em>Deciding she’s humiliated herself enough for one night (coming three times in the span of ten minutes) she keeps her mouth shut. </p><p>Rio doesn’t though.</p><p>“You’ve definitely slept with women before, right?”</p><p>Agatha laughs, “Yeah, why?”</p><p>“Because no one who doesn’t have any experience with women fucks one like <em> that,</em>” Rio says as Agatha watches her try to catch her breath.</p><p>“College,” Agatha says simply with a laugh.</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes. “Of course you had a college phase.”</p><p>Agatha pauses for a minute before she finds herself speaking her inner thoughts out loud again. “I’m starting to think Ralph was my phase.”</p><p>Rio turns on her side to face Agatha, one nimble finger reaching out to trace across the skin on the older woman’s chest. Agatha lets her eyes close as she relaxes into the feeling. </p><p>“Are you having a midlife crisis,” Rio questions with a laugh. Agatha mirrors it.</p><p>“Probably.”</p><p>Neither woman says any more as they just rest there and let their bodies catch up with the present. Rio watches the rise and fall of the older womens chest as she continues to draw light patterns on the raised skin there. Agatha lets her eyes rest, her mind doing anything but as a million thoughts swirl behind her eyes. </p><p>“You have a beautiful side profile,” Rio muses, to which Agatha just chuckles lightly—grateful for the sound of Rio’s voice giving her a moment of clarity. “Your nose is godly… I kinda wanna sit on it.”</p><p>To that, Agatha raises an eyebrow and looks over to Rio. “You got another one in you?”</p><p>“<em>Oh baby</em>,” Rio is already moving to pull herself up, “I can go all night.”</p><p>Agatha wakes up the next morning to light spilling in from her windows and a warm weight on her chest. When she flutters her eyes open, she’s met with a tussle of dark hair. It takes her a second to remember her night with Rio, but when she does, she smiles. This moment is very intimate for two coworkers who should definitely be putting more boundaries between them, but Agatha is quite tired of running from the things that make her feel good. </p><p>So fuck it. She wraps her arms around Rio and pulls her tighter. The younger woman stirs against her, burrowing down into her chest just a little more. They stay like that until Agatha remembers they aren’t alone and she most definitely has some explaining to do to her best friend who most certainly got an earful last night. </p><p>As softly as she can, she slides out from underneath her human furnace and throws a robe over her bare body. She leaves Rio sleeping peacefully and shuts the door softly behind her. When she taps down the hallway and breaks for the living room, she finds Jen nursing a cup of coffee in the kitchen and standing over a few take out bags on the counter. When she sees Agatha, she surprisingly smiles.</p><p>“I would ask you how you slept, but I know the answer and it's ‘not much.’”</p><p>Agatha laughs at her best friend, covering her face with her hand. She doesn’t feel embarrassed but she feels especially vulnerable with having someone witness this. Instead of acknowledging any of it, she walks towards the counter and looks into the bags. Jen tells her she has ordered breakfast on the account of Agatha being “free from the shackles of heterosexuality.” </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, but she grabs the biggest tray out of the bag and saunters over to the kitchen table. Jen follows her, the cup of coffee being her only clutch as she sits across from the CEO, her eyes narrowed and tight. </p><p>“You can interrogate me after I’ve eaten at least half of this omelet,” Agatha says as she digs into the food in front of her. She’d worked up quite the appetite if she is being honest. So as she eats her omelet, Jen watching her every move, she prepares herself for an onslaught of questions she really doesn’t have any answers to.</p><p>Jen does stand by her word. She doesn’t ask anything until the halfway bite is placed onto Agatha’s fork.</p><p>“Just sex huh,” Is her chosen question and the older woman can’t help the eye roll that washes over her.</p><p>“Shut the <em> fuck </em>up.”</p><p>“Yes,” Jen muses. “That is exactly what I said <em> multiple </em>times last night.”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, “Jealous?”</p><p>Jen laughs, “Yes.”</p><p>“Three times before we even left the hallway, Jen,” Agatha laughs like she can’t believe it herself.</p><p>“Six if you count all the times after that,” comes an unfamiliar voice as Rio walks up to the table and reaches onto Agatha’s plate to steal her piece of toast. She takes a bite as she smiles down at the pair sporting one of Agatha’s button ups and her discarded pair of sweats. She winks at Agatha. “Good morning ladies.” </p><p>Agatha feels her mouth go dry. Something about this just feels… Agatha can’t quite put her finger on it, but she knows that this feeling is definitely not unsettling. Jen’s raised eyebrow at Agatha’s lack of rebuttal doesn’t go unnoticed, but the CEO brushes it off.</p><p>“Good morning, Rio,” Jen says as she smiles knowingly. Agatha tightens her lips at her.</p><p>“I’d love to stay and chat, but I’ve got work in a few. Agatha,” she turns to the older woman. “Could you walk me out? I’m afraid I’ll get lost on my way.”</p><p>Jen snickers as Agatha slides her chair back and flicks her off. </p><p>When they are out of Jen’s eyesight, Rio turns to look back at Agatha with a grin as she reaches out and pulls the CEO close by the knot of her robe. She places a soft kiss to the older woman’s lips, humming sweetly when she pulls back. </p><p>Agatha feels her eyes open slowly, her mind overtaken with how wrong all of this should be. She’s in a relationship and Rio is her intern for god's sake, but everytime Rio so much as looks at her, everything feels worth risking. </p><p>“I’ll see you Monday,” Rio asks with a smile. “Unless you get bored in this <em>massive</em> apartment all by yourself.”</p><p>Agatha raises an eyebrow, “I guess only time will tell.”</p><p>She kisses Rio once more before she sends her on her way. When she turns back and enters the living room with a bright smile on her face, the sound of Jen’s voice pulls her back into reality.</p><p>“You’re <em>so</em> fucked.”</p><p>Agatha hurls a throw pillow across the kitchen and Jen just narrowly ducks under it.</p><p>She’s right though. Agatha is <em> definitely </em>fucked.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p align="left">Despite every bone in her body desperately wanting to, she doesn’t<em> </em>call Rio back over. It’s not without restraint as she nearly lets her resolve crumble when she has a good look at her reflection in the mirror after Jen leaves. Her bare chest is littered in purple blemishes that stand out against her ivory skin like sore thumb. Agatha takes her time tracing circles around the marks as if she’d be able to spawn the memories and the feelings behind them, but her own touch is too faint—too familiar. </p><p align="left">She’d never been one to call herself desperate, but at this particular moment, she’d go as far to say she’s desperate to have Rio’s hands replace her own again. </p><p align="left">To keep herself in check she opt’s for some alone time, which mostly means immersing herself in her email inbox and reviewing a plethora of documents she’s been neglecting like the plague. </p><p align="left">As she sits in her desk chair, glasses on her face and body fitting into the worn ridges of her cushion too perfectly, she feels a sweep of confidence fill her insides. Things have felt both in her control and out of it for the last few weeks, but here in this chair, her fingers move like magnets to exactly where they’re needed. If nothing else seems to fit into place, this does.</p><p align="left">But then she’s halfway down the first page of a legal agreement when the sound of Rio’s moans slip back into her head and her solid foundation starts to crack. She closes her eyes as well as tightens her legs together in a futile effort to get that semblance of control she’d just blindly had over herself. Though the feeling is not entirely unwanted, it’s impossible to focus on anything else with it lingering. She gets another two pages under her belt before her mind is pulled away, yet again, by the sound of her phone pinging next to her laptop.</p><p align="left">She ponders ignoring it. There’s only a handful of people who’d text her and none of them stand a the top of her chart of importance right now. But then she gets a glimpse of the newly acquired name on her screen. </p><p>It’s a text from Rio.</p><p>A media text at that. </p><p>Agatha’s finger pauses over the notification as she draws in a deeply calculated breath. She teeters on the edge of deleting it and pretending she’d never seen it or giving in and dealing with all the regret it would entail tomorrow. Because the fact of the matter is, it’s far too dangerous to leave any trail of evidence like this. It’s reckless and stupid and Rio should know better and—</p><p>Agatha clicks on the message.</p><p>The first thing Agatha is greeted with is a picture of Rio standing in front of her mirror, Agatha’s button up shirt thrown over her shoulders like a prized possession. <em>Strike one. </em></p><p>The kicker here though is the front of said button up is loosely unbuttoned, various spots of Rio’s bare upper body on display. One of those being the blaring obvious handy work Agatha had left behind—an alarming amount of purple marks scattered across her chest. Pair that sight with her beautifully toned midsection and those <em>damn </em>vine tattoos hugging against her under boob and Agatha’s mouth is suddenly dry. Rio’s hand is frozen in time as she delicately caresses over the marks near her nipple like she too is trying to stoke the memory behind them. <em>Strike two. </em></p><p>The memory of the older woman ravishing Rio’s skin like a mad woman crosses her mind and the thought of doing anything other than Rio seems like an impossible feat. She had fucked her into <em>six </em>earth shattering orgasms not even eight hours ago and here Agatha is… needing more.</p><p>Under the picture are three simple words: <em>thinking of you. </em></p><p>
<em>Strike three.</em>
</p><p>“<em>What the fuck</em>,” Agatha says audibly as she throws her head back to rest against the neck of her chair. She closes her eyes and bites at her lip apprehensively. Jen had said she was fucked, but she left out a few adjectives. She’s <em>royally </em>and <em>massively </em>fucked.</p><p>She recenters herself and types out the first response that comes to mind that doesn’t make her look as desperate as she feels. </p><p>
<em>You’re going to get me in trouble. </em>
</p><p>It’s a simple comment acknowledging but showing indifference. It keeps Agatha’s feet steady in this race and allows her to think just a little longer, but the returning message comes only a few seconds later. </p><p>
<em>I’m not worried. </em>
</p><p>Of course she’s not. What does she have to lose? This whole thing will most likely go down in flames and Agatha will be the one to take the brunt because she should’ve stopped all of this together. She’s the senior here. Letting this go on was—</p><p>Another ding.</p><p>
<em>Aren’t you going to tell me I look good like this? </em>
</p><p><em>like what? </em>Agatha asks, fingers moving before her mind even fully decided on what to say. She’s hooked like a fish and Rio’s just reeling her in to shore painfully slow with the false hope of her having time to escape lingering in the back of her mind. Another beat passes and Agatha feels like her chair is swallowing her whole. She finds she really doesn’t care about it either. </p><p>And then Rio rocks her world. </p><p>
<em>Like your slut. </em>
</p><p>She fights with her inner demons for all of thirty seconds before her fingers are typing away at the screen to take everything back. She types a total of five responses and each of them meet their fate of the backspace button. She considers deleting the text and pretending it never happened. Not to mention, the digital footprint is entirely reckless. Everything in Agatha should be sounding alarm bells, but the only thing she feels is the throbbing between her legs.</p><p>And Agatha will say it again. She is <em>not </em>god's strongest shoulder. Horniest? Absolutely, which is why it’s with that feeling in mind that she closes her legs together tightly and types out a firm response to the woman;</p><p>
<em>you’re such a good slut for me. </em>
</p><p>And the damn breaks as if it were ever strong enough to keep the water at bay in the first place because the sad fact of the matter is, Agatha’s morals have long left the station. Rio doesn’t have time to answer before Agatha is texting her next message with curses flying from under her breath. </p><p>
<em>My place. Tomorrow. Six o’clock. </em>
</p><p>If Agatha Harkness wants something, then by god, she’s going to get it. And when it comes to Rio… wanting her is as easy as breathing.</p><p align="center">—</p><p>It’s three o’clock in the afternoon when Agatha has her first breakdown. It’s a foreign feeling—apprehension. She’s normally calm, callused, and prepared. But this… she has acted on pure emotion and she’s paying the price for not giving herself time to think rationally. She’s been sitting at her desk telling herself she’s <em>definitely </em>comprehending the same words she’s been rereading to herself for the last two hours. She just might have to revisit them later to make sure they <em>really </em>stick. </p><p>It’s just that every time she’d start a line, her mind would wander to <em>those </em>places and she’d have to start over again only to end up back in the same loop. When Rio had responded to her text with a winking emoji—which is the least few words Agatha has ever seen her use—any hope of getting something actually done melted to the floor like a puddle. Much like Agatha’s resolve when Rio enters the equation. </p><p>Deciding that it’s best for all parties involved—including her emails, for her to push everything off until Monday, she closes her laptop and distances herself away from her desk. It’s on her way downstairs that a thought crosses her mind. Despite sex being on the forefront of her mind when she’d prompted Rio to come over, would Rio be expecting more? Were Agatha’s intentions clear? </p><p>And then she thinks about it for a second… What if she did have dinner with Rio? It could be casual. They would no doubt need the sustenance for their post dinner activities. It could be a nice gesture. And then the thought sinks deeper. She knows Rio’s naked body and what she likes and dislikes in that regard, but outside of that, she’s a stranger. Maybe it wouldn’t hurt to know each other a little more, so without thinking too deeply, she sends Rio a quick text;</p><p>
<em>Thoughts on dinner? </em>
</p><p>It takes a couple of minutes before Rio responds and Agatha has been rummaging through her fridge to see what she could come up with, but the moment her phone buzzes, she’s grasping her phone in her hands like a lifeline. </p><p>
<em>are we eating in?  </em>
</p><p>Agatha chews her lip, <em>Yes</em>. <em>What would you like? </em></p><p>The older woman can see Rio’s smirk through the screen, <em>i don’t care so long as you are for dessert… surprise me. </em></p><p>Agatha can work with that. </p><p>What surprises Agatha the most is that she’s not feeling guilty about any of it. The sneaking around—inviting someone else into a home she’s shared with a partner for years, it all just feels like a means to an end. It’s something that was always going to happen whether it’d have been with Rio or not because the fact of the matter is, Agatha is not a mundane person. The quiet, simple life that had begun to swallow her has finally received a boot to its ass. Feeling unburdened as she finely chops her onions, she finds herself excited. </p><p>It’s been a while since she’s put this much thought and effort into a meal. She once enjoyed cooking as she thoroughly believed it was the way she showed her love the best. She didn’t have to speak or try to fill uncomfortable silences. Her dishes filled in all the gaps and nearly everyone always had high praises. When she designed this kitchen, she wanted it to be a space she’d feel inspired in, but as time went on, she felt so distant from the person who once enjoyed this. It’s just one of the many things that was stolen from her. </p><p>When she’d stepped in to turn on the stove today, the familiar clicking of the gas igniting the burner immediately felt like a doorbell welcoming her home. She’s cutting her vegetables with a smile, humming along to the smooth jazz thrumming through her home. She has uncorked a wine bottle and poured herself a heaping serving, but surprisingly, it’s mostly gone untouched. For the first time in a long time, her home feels alive. </p><p>She’s got the sleeves to her button up rolled into cuffs near her elbows with her eyes sparkling behind her glasses. She’s wearing jeans that are loose around the hips and ankles, leaving her feeling much more relaxed. She’s in her element—commanding <em>her </em>kitchen. And all it took was a woman in her twenties to give her back this fire. </p><p>She’s so entranced by the aroma of her kitchen and the sounds of jazz that she doesn’t hear the knock on her door or the ping of her phone alerting her that Rio had arrived. It’s a quick thirty seconds before she notices that she isn’t alone and there are two dark eyes staring at her from across the kitchen island. Without thinking, she snatches the chef's knife off the cutting board and takes a defensive stance before she notices that her company is not unfamiliar.</p><p>Rio has wordlessly entered her home and perched herself across from the CEO at work where she had been leaning against the wall, for god knows how long, just watching. Agatha wants to take note of Rio’s much more relaxed attire as it’s the first time she’s seen her not in business casual or her slutty little bartender get up. It’s a simple black t-shirt, some blue jeans that could pass as high waters as she’s exposing her high socks with little green, pixelated blocks on them. She looks soft, but somehow still sharp around the edges. </p><p>“A knife,” Rio laughs as she steps closer. “Are you flirting with me?”</p><p>Agatha takes a sigh of relief, relaxing her muscles and releasing the knife back to its place. “I need to put a bell on you.”</p><p>Rio rounds the corner of the island and sidles up next to Agatha. She looks around at the ingredients Agatha has been preparing and a soft smile forms on her face. “This is nice. When you said dinner, I thought someone else would be preparing it. You don’t have help around here?”</p><p>Agatha laughs, “Unless you want Christian making it, no. It’s just me.”</p><p>Rio nods, but doesn’t say anything further. She stands beside Agatha, eyes brimming with curiosity as she intently watches the older woman’s hand work. Agatha is aware of the weight Rio’s eyes hold, but she just hums along to her jazz and turns her back to attend to the stove. </p><p>While she's mindlessly stirring the sauce in the pot, she feels two hands snake around her sides and wrap around the front of her midsection, pulling her backside flush against Rio’s front. The younger woman tucks her chin against Agatha’s shoulder, peering over it intently. The older woman can’t help the way her body tenses for a moment before she relaxes into it completely. Rio just hums into her ear and Agatha feels her chest tighten. </p><p>She continues stirring the sauce, willing herself to focus on that rather than the way her body is thrumming with excitement. She’d like to at least make it through dinner first. </p><p>“You look sexy when you cook,” Rio says softly. “I like this you. Especially the glasses.”</p><p>Agatha laughs softly, but the intimacy of the entire sentiment doesn’t fall on deaf ears. “So my lack of vision is what does it for you, huh?”</p><p>“Oh yeah,” Rio groans, but her hands quickly turn Agatha’s waist around so that the older woman is now facing her forward. She gasps at the quick action. “Come here, <em>four eyes.</em>”</p><p>And then Rio is tucking a finger under Agatha’s chin and leaning forward to press her lips against hers. It’s the softest they’ve ever kissed. The blush that forms on the older woman’s cheeks is involuntary, but Rio’s mimic her own, so she doesn’t feel so exposed. When the younger woman pulls back, she’s got a dopey smile on her face and a bright glint in her eye. Agatha feels something shift in her chest, but before she can panic about it, Rio’s turning her back around with a quick tug of her hips. Agatha gasps. </p><p>She feels Rio take a step back from her and she finds herself missing the warmth, but she’s grateful for the break in tension. She’s not ready to have a conversation with herself about why Rio not only makes her center feel something, but also her heart. She shakes the thought from her mind and she stirs through the sauce one more time and then she braces herself to turn around and see the younger woman once more. </p><p>She finds Rio sitting on top of the counter, legs swinging back and forth as she nurses Agatha’s wine glass in one hand and a carrot in the other—A carrot that she’s taken multiple bites out of. </p><p>“And what do you think you’re doing,” Agatha scolds as she reaches to snag both items from her grasp, but Rio is quick to move in protest. </p><p>“I’m hungry,” Rio says as she takes a bite of the carrot in victory. “I thought it would be ready when I got here, so…”</p><p>She takes another bite, swallowing it down with a swig of the wine and the older woman just sighs, “I liked my kitchen better ten minutes ago without a gremlin in it.”</p><p>Rio points the carrot at Agatha accusingly. “Lies,” and then she takes yet another bite. Agatha hates that her heart feels full. Actually—no, she doesn’t hate it. She finds herself feeling… <em>happy</em>? It’s such a foreign feeling. She’s normally so quick to dismiss everyone, but here Rio is, annoying as ever, and it just feels right. She smiles to herself as she rolls her eyes, moving back up to the cutting board to grab the few ingredients she chopped. </p><p>She can hear Rio mindlessly chewing on the carrot as she makes herself busy with the sauce again, but the sounds of the younger woman’s voice starting again isn’t entirely unwelcome. “Do you like to cook?”</p><p>Agatha smiles though Rio can’t see it from behind her. “Yes. I love it. I’d forgotten how much I love it until today.”</p><p>“Is today the first time you’ve cooked in a while,” Rio asks and Agatha finds herself feeling comfortable. She <em>wants </em>Rio to know these things.</p><p>“Yes. Ralph normally cooks because I…” She pauses for a moment, choosing her words carefully so as to not make herself look pathetic. “I just haven’t found the time.”</p><p>She settles on that and feels like it’s convincing enough, but Rio is always going to read into things. “Haven’t found the time or you just don’t feel like cooking for someone who doesn’t appreciate you?”</p><p>It’s blunt and accusatory. It carries a weight Agatha wasn’t ready for, but finds herself accepting anyways. Rio right after all. She’s somehow always hitting things right on the nose. The older woman turns around to look at the woman on her counter and she sees the look in Rio’s eyes. It’s soft and curious. She’d meant no malice behind her words.</p><p>Agatha’s first reaction is to deflect with a dry laugh. “I thought we’d gotten past the psychological analysis at this point?”</p><p>Rio frowns almost immediately. She shakes her head, eyes locked onto Agatha’s like the scope of a gun. “Well, I appreciate you, Agatha.”</p><p>The older woman gasps audibly as if the air from her lungs had been stripped. The moment is incredibly tender and Rio’s eyes are so <em>fucking </em>sincere that she’s drowing in them. Her mouth goes dry and any response she could’ve said cracks into dust, but the younger woman notices this with ease. She just smiles softly.</p><p>“I really do appreciate this as well,” she motions to the array of ingredients. “This smells lovely. I don’t think you’ve lost your touch in your absence.”</p><p>Agatha just smiles, relief flooding her veins. “I wouldn’t speak just yet. You haven’t tasted it.” </p><p>“I’ve tasted the woman that made it and she’s a ten out of ten so I have high hopes…”</p><p>Agatha throws a piece of a chopped carrot the younger woman’s way and Rio tries to catch it in her mouth but it ends up smacking her on her forehead between her eyes. The two share a giggle before Agatha starts to plate two servings of the food she’s prepared. Rio watches her like an owl perched on a branch, intrigued with everything in it’s sight. She hadn’t been lying when she said she was hungry and the carrot clearly had only done so much to satiate that. They both sit at the island, side by side. Agatha places both of their plates down in front of them and then makes an effort to grab another glass down from her cabinets to fill Rio up her very own glass of wine. </p><p>“How chivalrous of you, Ms. Harkness,” Rio comments with a smile. Agatha just returns the action. </p><p>Rio takes the first bite of the meal and she’s groaning like a madwoman at the taste on her tongue. </p><p>“Now that’s dramatic,” Agatha laughs as she shovels her own bite of food into her mouth. <em>Okay, so maybe it wasn’t. This is actually very good.  </em></p><p>“It’s not. This is fucking insane,” Rio comments, mouth full of food and a spoonful of another bite waiting in the wings. “You are <em>so </em>getting head after this.” </p><p>Agatha laughs and it's boisterous. Rio looks stunned at first, but the older woman can’t bring herself to care. This—<em>this </em>is what happiness is supposed to feel like. If she closes her eyes she can see this being her nightly routine—Rio included. She’s not ashamed in the slightest for thinking about it. In fact, she feels a pull in her chest because it’s not real. She wants to be sad about it, but Rio’s started laughing too and their laughs mix together in between them and everything just feels warm. </p><p>She lives in the moment for once. </p><p>They mostly eat the rest of their dinner on better terms. The conversation is definitely more civilized. Agatha learns Rio’s favorite color is green, but not the lime green preteens painted their walls with in 2013, but green like the color of vines and the richness of the Earth. She learns that Rio has an affinity for video games. That fact only slips out when Agatha comments on her socks and Rio’s response is, ‘<em>Hey. Minecraft is one of the best games of all time. These are Creepers. They blow up when you get near them. Hey, you kinda remind me of a Creeper.’ </em> </p><p>And a ten minute rant on Agatha’s likeness to a video game character clues her in to Rio’s secret passion. Agatha finds herself listening the entire time, noting the way Rio animatedly talks with her hands and her bright smile challenges the bright spark in her eye when she talks about something she loves like this. When Rio stops talking, it’s the first time in the older woman’s life that she wishes to hear more about a video game just to see Rio’s smile again. </p><p>But it’s by this time that their plates are empty and their bellies are full and the only thing Agatha is thinking about is how she can transition this into her bedroom. And then she remembers a comment Rio made and she stands up out of her chair to backpedal towards her room, eyes finding Rio’s as she says, “So I believe someone promised me head?”</p><p>The younger woman is up and out of her chair in seconds. </p><p>Agatha never really even stood a chance. The fact crosses her mind when she’s throwing Rio back onto the bed like a ragdoll and straddling her face in one quick succession. From the moment the younger woman had crossed the threshold of her office, she was always going to end up in this exact moment because the fact of the matter is, she wanted to. </p><p>Agatha wants this. She wants Rio’s tongue lapping at her from between her legs as she grinds down onto her face involuntarily. Rio’s hands are clawing at her backside and pushing the older woman further into her mouth and its so <em>fucking </em>desperate that she can’t imagine anyone else craving her this much. Agatha’s got her hand firmly grounded in Rio’s hair, using her as a much needed clutch as she grinds down with her hips. Rio’s moans are vibrating her core and sending shockwaves into her gut as she feels herself losing the battle of holding onto this feeling for just a bit longer. </p><p>Her legs are starting to shake around Rio’s head and her hips are wildly bumping into Rio’s nose as the first wave of orgasmic pleasure starts to wreck her body. Rio tightens her hold around her thighs and keeps her close, lapping up every single drop Agatha is giving her as the CEO nearly screams her name in ecstasy. </p><p>When Rio shows no signs of letting up and the pressure in her core is tight that it starts to hurt. Agatha starts whimpering, “I can’t. I can’t.”</p><p>Rio lets up then, an annoying smile on her wet lips. Agatha looks down to her and reaches out to run the pad of her thumb across her lips, coating it in her own arousal before sticking it through the threshold of Rio’s mouth. The younger woman takes the digit into her mouth, sucking against it and running her tongue up the length of it. When the older woman pulls her finger back with a pop, Rio frowns at the loss. </p><p>“Don’t frown,” Agatha chastises. “It’s unbecoming of a woman who just made me come.”</p><p>Rio laughs and Rolls over to push Agatha off of her. The CEO lands with an <em>oof </em>to which they both start laughing at. They lay there for a brief moment in a content silence. They’re laying across from each other on their sides, looking into one another and smiling softly as their eyes rake across the other bare body. Agatha reaches out with a nimble finger and starts to trace along the tattooed vines under Rio’s breast. Agatha can hear the younger woman’s breathing speed up.</p><p>“If my glasses are what does it for you, this is what does it for me.”</p><p>Rio laughs, “That’s good to know because I’ve got an album on my phone with plenty more ideas.”</p><p>Agatha retracts her hand and groans, turning her body to look at the ceiling. “You’re going to kill me, Rio Vidal and I’m going to come back and haunt your ass every day until you’re a ghost with me and then I’m going to kill you again.”</p><p>Rio laughs, “I’m not sure that’s how that works.”</p><p>“I don’t care,” Agatha says firmly. “It makes sense to me.”</p><p>“And all is right in the world if something makes sense to Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>“Now you’re finally getting it.” </p><p>Another moment of content silence passes as Agatha gets a strange feeling. It’s almost like she can sense Rio’s gears working on overtime beside her and she debates it within herself if she should comment on it or just let it be. Of course, it’s the latter. “I can smell your gears turning from here. Spill it.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t turn to look at the younger woman, but she knows there’s a look of hesitation crossing over her face. She must wrestle with herself for a moment and then as if finally deciding to spill, she sits up on her behind. Agatha turns to look up at her, watching the way she nervously pokes her tongue against her cheek. </p><p>“Are you going to tell me or am I going to have to pretend to read your mind?”</p><p>“You mean you’ve been a fraud this whole time?”</p><p>“Shut up and talk.”</p><p>Rio sighs, “I want to try something.”</p><p>Agatha nods slowly, prodding Rio to continue.</p><p>“But I have to go get it. It’s in my bag.”</p><p>And Agatha has a semblance of an idea of where this is going, but she lets Rio move at her own pace. Firstly, because she doesn’t want Rio to feel anything other than confident and secondly, if this is what she thinks it is, her eagerness would no doubt scare the younger woman. So with a tender smile, Agatha nods. </p><p>When Rio exits the room, Agatha gets another glimpse of the ink on Rio’s perfect backside and her stomach turns. Rio’s so damn perfect it’s criminal. And when the younger woman returns, her hands hidden behind her back, Agatha is only distracted by the front of her bare body for a brief moment. It’s as beautiful as always though it looks admittedly better littered in faded purple marks from Agatha’s mouth. She reminds herself that she needs to freshen them up. Rio smiles when she notices her longing eyes, but quickly goes back to her timid nature.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>And Agatha knows. She’s not dumb, but she’s asking because she needs to see it to end the fire burning in her belly at the thought of what’s to come. When Rio brings her hands around to reveal a harness in one hand and an emerald green didlo in her other, Agatha’s breath hitches.</p><p>“It’s mine,” Rio is quick to say. “I only use it on myself, so don’t think this is something dirty.”</p><p>An image of Rio fucking into herself with it crosses Agatha’s mind and suddenly the room feels like it’s on fire and Rio is ten yards away and she can’t get to her fast enough. </p><p>“Ask me,” is all Agatha can say as she springs herself up onto her knees. Rio looks confused for a moment, but quickly gathers her thoughts. </p><p>“Please,” is Rio’s short answer as she starts walking towards the bed.</p><p>“Please what,” Agatha toys as she crawls to the edge of the bed to meet Rio halfway. She’s on her knees, nose near Rio’s as the intrusive item hangs between them like forbidden fruit.</p><p>Rio wets her lips, “Please <em>fuck</em> <em>me</em>, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha groans, “I thought you’d never ask.”</p><p>Agatha raises a slow hand to grab the harness from Rio’s hand and she takes a step forward to step onto the hardwood floor—Rio takes a step back. The older woman stands before her broadly and slides the straps around her thighs. She can feel the younger woman’s eyes follow her every move until Agatha is back standing up before her, eyeing the appendage in Rio’s hand.</p><p>It’s a wordless exchange—one that Rio picks up on immediately as she reaches out to tuck a finger in the waistband of the harness and separates it from Agatha’s midsection. Just enough to where she can slide the didlo into its respective slot. As she lowers the appendage into its place, her hand brushes against the smeared wetness on Agatha’s center from where Rio had just devoured her. They both gasp. </p><p>She looks up to Agatha with dark eyes as she removes her hands. The older woman looks at her with an impossibly darker look, her hand coming up to cup underneath Rio’s sharp jaw. She leans forward just a hair to breathe against Rio’s lips, “Kneel.” </p><p>And Rio sinks to her knees almost immediately, the hold Agatha has on her chin grounding her the entire way. When she stops eye level with Agatha’s new appendage, the older woman urges her forward with a tug and Rio wraps her lips around the head of the dildo, grabbing the base of it with her hand to push it firmly against Agatha’s center. </p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>,” is the curse that leaves the older woman’s lips as she rocks her hips gently into Rio’s mouth. The younger woman stares up into her soul, a glint of teasing behind them and Agatha swears she can feel it. She can feel every bit of Rio’s tongue, the warmness of her mouth. Agatha’s rarely been close to coming from her thoughts alone, but this is one of the times she swears she could. </p><p>She needs to be in Rio right <em>fucking </em>now.</p><p>She backs the appendage out of Rio’s mouth and urges her upwards with a tug under her chin. Their lips come crashing together, tongues finding each other like magnets as Agatha reaches behind and grabs a handful of Rio’s ass, pulling her forward so their bodies collide. </p><p>Agatha breaks their lips apart breathlessly, “On your knees. <em>Now.</em>”</p><p>“Say please,” Rio bats her eyelashes, but even Agatha can see it's futile. </p><p>“Rio…” It’s a warning, but it falls on deaf ears. </p><p>“What? Are you going to punish me?”</p><p>And then its clicks. Agatha understands. Rio is asking to be put in her rightful place—underneath Agatha. Agatha’s got her hand on Rio’s waist before she can think. The other one’s got a handful of her hair as she stalks behind the younger woman and forces her downwards onto the bed. Rio’s face is buried in the sheets, her hands gripping into them beside her head. Agatha keeps a hand in her hair, always tugging as she brings her other hand down onto Rio’s right cheeks with a slap. </p><p>Rio’s moan is swallowed by the bed and that just simply won’t do. Agatha pulls her grip on her hair and forces Rio up onto her hands. She lays down another slap and the moan is unguarded. It hits Agatha right between her legs. </p><p>“Are you going to be good for me, Rio?”</p><p>There’s a whimper and another slap lays down on the reddened cheek underneath her hand. </p><p>“Words Rio,” Agatha demands. “Use your words.”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio hisses, arching her back into Agatha’s touch.</p><p>“Yes, <em>what</em>?”</p><p>“Yes, I’m going to be good for you.” </p><p>“Good,” Agatha nearly whispers as she lines herself up against Rio’s center and tightens her hold against the hair on Rio’s head. She then pushes her hips forward and slides into Rio without any resistance whatsoever. Her thrust is met with a guttural groan.</p><p>“<em>Yes</em>,” It’s long and drug out and comes off of Rio’s tongue like a sin. Agatha pushes in harder, entranced by the way Rio’s back flexes with each motion and the tattoo that covers it. She’s sure she’s never seen a hotter sight and it only urges her on.</p><p>She brings her hand down in another firm slap and is met with another beautiful moan. Agatha feels like she’s been starving for this her whole life. When Rio starts to meet her thrust with her hips, pushing back into each one, Agatha feels herself start to run down the inner parts of her thighs. </p><p>“You’re insane. You feel so good, baby,” It slips from her lips without a second thought. “<em>Fuck, </em>I could be inside of you forever.” </p><p>As Agatha looks down to see her disappearing inside of Rio with the sounds of her arousal hitting her ears, she becomes entranced. She can feel it. Call it ‘phantom dick’ or whatever, but she <em>can </em>feel this. She stops her thrusts for a moment to back out of Rio and flip the girl over onto her back. She’s met with confusion at first, but she doesn’t give it time to settle as she slides back in immediately. Seeing Rio’s eyes roll in the back of her is exactly what she needed, but it isn’t what she’s after. </p><p>“Look at me,” Agatha whispers, her thrusts hitting between each word and by the sheer force of will, Rio’s eyes connect with hers and Agatha smiles. “<em>Watch </em>with me.” </p><p>And then Agatha tears her eyes down to between her legs where she’s disappearing in and out of Rio with ease. She peeks for a moment to see Rio look at the action, her lip trapped between her teeth as whimpers are trapped behind.</p><p>“Look at you taking me so good,” Agatha coos, in awe of it herself. </p><p>Rio is wordless now, being fucked into a puddle will do that to you. As she holds onto Agatha’s neck tightly, legs wrapped around Agatha’s waist with her eyes still locked where the older woman had commanded them, Agatha can tell she’s approaching her end. There’s just one thing.</p><p>“Touch yourself for me,” Agatha whispers, and like a bullet, Rio’s hand is working herself up almost immediately. The older woman groans at the site because somehow, each one gets better than the last. “That’s it, baby. I want you to come for me. Can you do that?”</p><p>Rio’s nodding, tears brimming on the corner of her eyes as her breaths are shattered. Her hand is working against herself in circles, Agatha matches each completion with a secure thrust. It takes two and a half thrusts before the younger woman is screaming out from under her, legs tensing around Agatha’s waist as she slows her movements ever so slightly. Rio hangs on by her nails for dear life as her orgasm wrecks through her body unlike any time before. She’s gasping when she finally regains her sense of self, Agatha staring at her in awe as if she hadn’t been the cause of her near death experience.</p><p>Rio raises a finger and taps it against Agatha’s lips. “This. This is a <em>fucking </em>problem.” </p><p>“My mouth?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio nods. “It’s filthy.” </p><p>Agatha laughs, “And here I thought you loved it.”</p><p>“No, I lied.”</p><p>Agatha quirks a brow. “So a refresher course is needed?”</p><p>“Wha-”</p><p>And then Agatha’s head is between Rio’s legs, licking up her mess as Rio squirms against her.</p><p align="center">—</p><p>When they stumble out of the bedroom around one am in search of some subsistence to fill more than just their sexual appetite, Rio isn’t surprised Agatha chooses a freshly uncorked Château Lafite over anything solid. She hums to herself as she finishes buttoning up her shirt she’d stolen from Agatha’s closet on the way out and busies herself elsewhere. Agatha watches over the rim of her wine glass as Rio slowly and diligently drags her fingers against the vertically stacked vinyls crammed into a wall length bookcase as she taps through the many titles. Fleetwood Mac. Frank Sinatra. Bob Dylan. Hall and Oates. </p><p>“You’ve got quite the collection here,” the younger girl hums, her eyes roaming through the expansive space of music. “Anything from this decade?”</p><p>“I’m an old soul,” Agatha answers confidently. </p><p>Rio shoots a smile over her shoulder. “Old soul or just old?”</p><p>Agatha scoffs, turning away from the brunette as she stalks over to the kitchen island to refill her glass. As she does so, she watches as Rio plucks out a Vinyl that <em>finally </em>appears to be of her liking and places it down onto the turntable just a few steps away. Agatha carries both the wine and her half empty glass to the couch stationed in front of Rio. She tucks herself into the far right corner and nurses her wine glass as she gleams up at Rio intently, watching as the younger woman leans over just enough to reveal the swell of her lower ass cheeks. Agatha traps her bottom lip between her teeth. </p><p>When the needle scratches fill the air and then the sound of <em>Sexual Healing </em>cuts through the tension thick air, Agatha tries not to choke on her wine. </p><p>It’s not that it’s cliche—because it totally is. It’s the fact that Rio somehow makes everything Agatha once thought as such now so much more appealing. Because how can she look at the younger girl who is haphazardly adorned in one of Agatha’s white button-downs, sleeves rolled up to her elbows—nothing underneath of course—and not desperately want to devour every inch of her? <em>Especially </em>when her hips are absentmindedly swaying to the beat and her mouth is hanging open slightly as she lets her body move on auto pilot. </p><p>Agatha is paralyzed, entranced, completely and devastatingly, <em>wrecked </em>all at the same time. She didn’t think it could get much worse until Rio started stalking over to her, a smirk painted on her fucking perfect lips. </p><p>“<em>When I get that feeling</em>…” And oh <em>God </em>she’s singing. “<em>I want sexual healing.</em>”</p><p>If lust could be personified into a person, Agatha would be at the courthouse first thing in the morning to change her name. The deep ache turns in lower her belly as Rio leans down near the older woman’s lips and places her hands firmly on Agatha’s steady knees. “<em>Sexual healing, baby, is good for me</em>.”</p><p>Agatha’s tongue darts out to wet her increasingly dry lips. Rio mirrors the action as she dips impossibly lower, her lips ghosting over Agatha’s. “<em>And honey, I know you’ll be there to relieve me</em>.” </p><p>The older woman finds herself dipping forward, eager to meet Rio’s lips, but the younger woman sinisterly laughs and pulls herself back—shaking her head disapprovingly. “Have you no restraint? I’m trying to put on a show for you here?”</p><p>Agatha sighs, “You think you’re cute don’t you?”</p><p>Rio quirks her eyebrow, “I’m not sure <em>cute </em>is quite what I’m going for right now.”</p><p>“Try harder, sweetheart,” Agatha challenges, her voice steadier than she absolutely feels. Her last shred of composure she’s desperately holding onto snaps when Rio winks at her, dipping down to wrap her lips around the rim of Agatha’s wine glass as she takes it into her own hands, her dark brown eyes never leaving Agatha’s blue’s.</p><p>When Rio backs off of Agatha and stands tall again, the older woman tries to ignore the way she enjoys looking up at Rio from this angle and despite her efforts to hide it, it’s clear Rio has already arrived at that conclusion as well. She doesn’t entertain teasing Agatha about it, instead, she resumes swaying her hips to the music. The wine in the glass sloshes about dangerously and any other time Agatha would be halfway to scolding her for it, but the CEO’s eyes haven’t left the expansive skin that is Rio’s tanned legs. </p><p>Rio moves like the music speaks through her. It’s sensual and sexy and setting every single nerve in Agatha’s body alight. And when Rio brings the glass up to her lips and downs the lasting sip of wine, her neck stretches up and calls to Agatha like a prayer. She feels frozen in place like this is her sole purpose in life—to sit here and gawk at Rio like she’s put every damn star in the sky, walking around like she <em>absolutely </em>knows it. </p><p>Agatha lifts a single finger towards the young woman and beckons her forward to which Rio complies with a smile, twisting and turning her body towards the older woman in time with the rhythms like she’s pulled under a spell. When Rio reaches her, she stands tall in front of her and Agatha straightens up her back on the couch, looking up into the dark eyes above her. Rio reaches under Agatha’s chin, grabbing hold of it and pulling her attention even tighter. Agatha tries to stand, but Rio keeps her down with a sharp push. </p><p>When she finds Rio’s eyes, she sees the woman shake her head, “Kiss me first.”</p><p>And <em>dear god</em> was Agatha wrong. <em>This</em>. This is her purpose. With a quick lick of her lips, she nods softly. Rio loosens the grip on her chin and instead runs her fingers through the hair on the older woman’s scalp. When Rio reaches the back of her head, she urges the woman forward and Agatha leans into it, wrapping her hands around the backs of Rio’s thighs and clawing desperately into the soft skin there. When she closes her eyes and nudges her nose through the dripping folds in front of her, she isn’t sure who moans louder. But when she darts her tongue out to run a slow, agonizing drag through Rio’s folds, it’s <em>definitely </em>the younger woman whose moan topples through the room the loudest.</p><p>“<em>Shit</em>,” comes the verbal affirmation. </p><p>Agatha presses in harder, mixing the taste of wine and Rio on her tongue.</p><p>Agatha meant to keep control, meant to keep Rio as nothing more than an indulgence—a reckless, irresistible mistake. But the moment Rio’s fingers thread tighter in her hair, not commanding so much as clinging, something inside Agatha fractures.</p><p>She drags her tongue deliberately, savoring the shiver that ripples through Rio’s body, and for the first time it isn’t victory she tastes. It’s something far more intimate. Rio tilts her head back, a broken sound escaping her lips, and Agatha’s chest aches in a way that has nothing to do with desire.</p><p>When Rio finally pulls her up, urgently, almost desperately, Agatha finds herself caught in a kiss that’s far too tender for the game they’ve been playing. It’s slow, messy, full of wine and heat, but beneath it lingers something terrifyingly real. Rio isn’t just kissing her; she’s giving herself over, piece by piece.</p><p>Agatha’s hands grip her hips, fingers digging in as if holding her there might keep the moment from unraveling. And as Rio pants softly against her mouth, whispering her name like it’s sacred, Agatha realizes she doesn’t just want her in this bed, or in this night. She wants her tomorrow, and the day after, and all the days Rio will inevitably drive her mad.</p><p>The thought terrifies her more than anything ever has.</p><p>She presses her forehead to Rio’s, swallowing hard, and for once the great Agatha Harkness is undone by a girl who was supposed to be nothing more than a mistake.</p><p align="center">—</p><p>The next morning Agatha wakes up feeling like she never has before. Firstly, she’s sore. Every bone and muscle in her aches with the reminder of the past eight hours worth of physical activity she’d put herself through. Secondly, her heart is full. </p><p>There’s soft breathing next to her as Rio lies with her back facing her, hair strode across the silk pillows and that beautiful work of art on her back peeking above the sheets. Agatha reaches out to trace the lines, smiling to herself with no particular thought in mind. She hears Rio hum softly in her sleep and her smile gets wider. She is not ready to leave this moment—this <em>bliss. </em>She’s not ready for Rio to go, so she devises a plan. As quietly as she can, she turns over to grab her phone. </p><p>“Hey Christian, I need a favor. How good are you at picking out dresses?”</p><p>When Rio stirs just a little later, she asks what that was all about, but Agatha just smiles unbotheredly tucking Rio’s hair behind her ear. The younger girl looks at her cautiously, but her resolve doesn’t move. She just simply asks, “Where’s your favorite place to get food around here?”</p><p>Rio raises an eyebrow and then Agatha’s phone pings.</p><p>“Oh that’s Christian. He’s here with your dress,” she says as she launches herself out of their warm nest and pulls her robe off the floor next to them.</p><p>“My <em>what</em>?!”</p><p>Agatha winks. “Lunch in twenty. You pick. I’m gonna shower.” </p><p>Rio scrambles up to her knees. “Dress? Lunch? Agatha, what if I have plans?”</p><p>“Minecraft can wait,” Agatha says as she goes to exit towards the door. Rio attempts to follow after her but gets tangled up in the loose sheets. They wrap around her ankles and she trips back onto the floor.</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p align="center">—</p><p>As Agatha waits for Rio to finish getting ready, she stands in front of her windows, wine glass in hand. She’s looking out into the city, but she’s not thinking of anything beyond the thick panels of glass in front of her. These last few hours with Rio are beyond the scope of anything she could’ve ever imagined. She’d always thought sex like <em>that </em>to be something for the movies—for young couples with no inhibitions. She’d had her brief stint with Ralph, but looking at it now, she wouldn’t even hold a candle to it. Rio keeps her on her toes, challenges her at every corner all while simultaneously charming her way into Agatha’s heart. She smiles at the thought.</p><p>She hears a few things shuffle in her room and she turns around to chuckle to herself. She’d opted to go easy on herself—a nice black suit, forgoing any undershirt and settling on a black lacy bra for a little extra something. Rio though, it sounds like she is laying bricks and fighting nations. </p><p>As she stares into the closed door of her room endearingly, she looks just to her left to see her record player still sitting with the last played vinyl on top. She goes to place it back into its sleeve and slide it into a random spot on the shelf when her <em>Frank Sinatra’s Best Hits </em>record is staring her in the face. She pulls it from its place and gives the back a once over. She smiles when she reads a particular song and without so much as a second thought, she places the record down and slides the needle to the third line.  </p><p>She hears heels clicking behind her as the first few sounds of <em>Witchcraft </em>fill the air. She finds Rio in an emerald green, strapless dress. Her hair flowing over her shoulders like an endless river. The dark makeup around her eyes blends in with the actual darkness of her irises and it's so incredibly sexy that Agatha can’t tear her eyes away. She’s so overcome with an immense longing because after putting these feelings off for so long, she can now give Rio the worship that she deserves.  </p><p>“You’re absolutely stunning, Rio.” It’s a simple fact, but it turns Rio’s face red regardless. “Remind me to give Christian a bonus.”</p><p>Agatha starts to move forward towards the younger woman, her eyes entranced.</p><p>“Dance with me.”</p><p>Rio laughs at first because there’s no way Agatha would willingly do something like dance without a gun to her head, but she’s got her hand extended out in front of her waiting intently for Rio’s to take hold. When Rio does move forward and clasp Agatha’s hand, she’s quickly pulled flush into the front of the older woman’s body. Their hips and chests bump, giggles spilling from the pair as Agatha wraps one hand around the small of Rio’s back, the other one still firmly holding Rio’s hand—leading them. Rio snakes her hand around Agatha’s neck, resting her hand on the nape there as Agatha sways them to the beat. </p><p>“Is this your way of <em>wooing </em>me,” Rio asks with a laugh to which Agatha backs away from the younger woman and then lifts her arm to twirl Rio underneath. She complies, turning on her heels and then finds herself being twisted back into an embrace with her back molding into Agata’s front. The CEO’s hands are wrapped around Rio’s body from the back, keeping her close. They sway just like that.</p><p>“That depends if it’s working or not,” Agatha lowers her voice into Rio’s ear. She can see the younger girl shutter and she lets out a low chuckle. “I can see my answer, darling.” </p><p>She then spins Rio back out from her arms and extends her out before pulling her back flush to her body, slowly swaying them to the music once more. Their noses are nearly touching, foreheads resting together before Rio leans forward and pulls Agatha’s lips onto her own. It’s a deep, slow kiss. Agatha’s stomach turns at the feeling and she has to pull back. </p><p>“If you keep doing that we’re going to be late to our reservation,” Agatha hums, still swaying them along. </p><p>“I thought you said I could pick?”</p><p>There’s a glimmer in Agatha’s eye, “Yeah, <em>well</em>, there’s a place I want you to try. Let’s go before I change my mind and eat you instead.”</p><p>Rio laughs and the sound hits Agatha’s ears like a song. There’s a lot of things that could happen. She could be fired. She could be sued. The thoughts swirl in her head like a hive of bees, but with just one look into Rio’s eyes, it feels worth the risk. </p>

<p><em> Lunch </em> ends up being an early dinner by the time they leave the apartment. The restaurant Agatha takes Rio to is definitely not anything close to what Rio would have chosen for them, but the smile on her face tells Agatha she’s going to enjoy it all the same. It’s a small place tucked away in the corner of Essex and Canal, just a few blocks away from the Hudson. It’s close enough to Agatha’s home that they were able to walk. </p><p>On the way over, the Autumn air painted a blush across Rio’s cheeks and paired with her gapped tooth smile—That memory will stick with the older woman for a long, long time. There are few things in this world she feels are worthy of her undivided attention and Rio is nearly the only thing that receives it without hesitation.</p><p>Even when they're doing something as mundane as walking down the street, Agatha’s walking closest to the oncoming traffic to keep Rio safe. She’s always knowingly and unknowingly carrying herself with Rio in mind. Her hands stay in her pockets the entire time, but they burn to reach out and signal for the younger woman’s hand. She’s never been into physical touch, but the thought of not having her hand on Rio in some capacity feels like a punishment.  </p><p>Especially when she’s hyper aware of the lingering eyes ravishing <em> her </em> Rio as they pass by. Christian had picked out a stunner of a dress, but it’s Rio’s figure that’s going the extra mile. It’s a floor length dress, more casual than ballroom, but the strapless top is what is commanding all the attention. Agatha fights everything within herself to keep from doing something stupid like claiming the younger woman against one of the many light posts they’ve passed. Maybe even the parked cars? The post box? Any surface. Agatha’s itching to have Rio clawing against it for everyone to see who she belongs to. </p><p>So when Agatha holds the door open for Rio to enter, she places a hand on the small of her back as though to guide her through it—it’s a silent victory she’ll take with her to the grave. </p><p>The dining room is dim and mostly lit by flickering candles on each table and identical sconces on the deep green walls. Intricate picture frames of different musical artists are placed throughout as well as multiple framed records—some platinum awards.</p><p>“This is neat,” Rio says as she leans into Agatha’s firm hand on her back. Her eyes are searching across the space, never lingering on one thing for too long. The older woman watches her intently and just hums as she waits for a hostess to seat them. </p><p>Though, it’s not the hostess that greets them. It’s the owner and the sight of her has Agatha smiling gently to herself.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness,” the woman says. </p><p>“Alice,” Agatha returns the sentiment and only grimaces slightly when the woman throws herself into her arms. When they part, Alice’s smile is genuine, but the way she flutters her eyes over to Rio for a moment says there’s an unspoken asking behind them as well. </p><p>Agatha nods softly and Alice immediately turns to the woman next to her and extends her hand. It’s quite a professional courtesy for two people who’ve met in a club before but the sight brings a chuckle to Agatha’s lips because it’s giving her deja vu. </p><p>“Pleasure to see you again,” Alice says. “Though I must say you looked great in black but green is definitely your color. You look stunning.”</p><p>“Okay. That’s enough drooling, Alice,” Agatha chastises as her hand gets impossibly tighter against Rio’s back. “I’d like a booth please.”</p><p>As they walk behind Alice to follow her to their seats, Agatha gathers two thoughts from that interaction. One, Jen isn’t as trustworthy as she’d thought her to be or either Agatha isn’t as careful as she’d thought she was being. Then again, she did practically dry jump Rio in plain sight for everyone—including Alice—to see, but that’s only a minor tell. It’s definitely Jen’s fault. </p><p>Alice takes them to a quiet and dimly lit booth near the back of the restaurant. She wishes them a great meal as she leaves and Agatha starts to question why Jen and her tend to be closer when Alice clearly knows when to leave things be. Then again, Agatha has always preferred a challenge. </p><p>“So, do all of your friends know about us,” Rio says with a light laugh as she slides into the seat across from Agatha. </p><p>The older woman sighs, “Blame Jen.”</p><p>Rio raises her brow. “Oh it’s Jen’s fault? Definitely not yours?”</p><p>Agatha scoffs, “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” </p><p>“You’re on a date with a younger woman despite being engaged to a man. I wouldn’t exactly call that being careful.”</p><p>It’s a light jab, but it hits Agatha square in her chest with the force of a freight train. She’d had a smart comment on her lips about Rio’s mention of this being a date, but it gets smothered by the overwhelming slew of conflict that starts to fill her brain.</p><p>She knows she’s not staying with Ralph. That’s the easiest part of this all. But then there’s Rio. There’s always Rio. She’s the most complicated thing Agatha’s ever encountered because she’s aggravating and annoying, but sexy and charming and it’s all wrapped into a bow with a box labeled ‘Agatha’s kryptonite.’ But despite it all, she is supposed to be temporary. Her internship has hit its halfway point. Soon it’ll be December and the tie that tethers them together will disappear. </p><p>Is Agatha supposed to let her go and move on with her life after her foundations have been shifted by someone who’s cracked her hard exterior with ease and made her feel both weak and powerful all in the same breath? She feels her chest clench at the thought. She’s not a spring chicken by any means, but by all definitions, Rio is. She’s got years ahead of her with a law degree and—no doubt—a prestigious job offer waiting in the wings. Would she even miss Agatha?</p><p>“Where’d you go, Agatha,” Rio asks softly, eyes entirely too soft in the flickering candle light. </p><p>There’s a million things Agatha could say. She could play it off. She could spill her entire life story onto the wooden table in front of them and then inevitably try and clean it up with her already soaked mop because the fact of the matter is, she’s drowning in the weight of her untouched decisions. </p><p>She could have everything she’s ever wanted. All she has to do is speak—The universe and its impeccable timing send the waiter over to them at the exact moment Agatha could feel the grasp on her walls slipping. He introduces himself, but Agatha doesn’t hear it over the pulsating heartbeat in her ears. She looks up to him with a tight smile. “Two glasses of Chablis please.”</p><p>He nods curtly and excuses himself to go grab them when Rio’s voice pipes up, “I have no idea what that is.”</p><p>Agatha laughs softly. “It’s a chardonnay—one of my favorites.”</p><p>Rio nods and Agatha can tell by the curious look on her face she tucks that piece of information away. She’ll probably Google it later on and the thought brings a smile to the older woman’s lips. Something about showing Rio new things makes her smile both inside and out. When the waiter returns with their glasses, he places one in front of Agatha and then the other in front of Rio, followed by the entire bottle. “Compliments of the owner, ma’am.”</p><p>Agatha leaves a mental reminder to find Alice before she leaves and thank her for such a kind gesture. The waiter exits once again and leaves Agatha, Rio and the building blocks of tension between them that are starting to get harder to see over. Agatha can do sex, but acknowledging feelings feels like such an impossible feat. Especially when the woman in question is sitting across from her and making everything seem so small. How could she complain about how anything is going when Rio’s looking at her like she hangs the stars in the sky? </p><p>“What did you say to me,” Rio pauses in thought. “I can smell your gears turning from here?”</p><p>Agatha slowly chuckles and then sighs. It’s now or never. At Least she can use being in public as a shield when this inevitably goes by the wayside. She’s not the greatest at this part. </p><p>“I’m sure I’m digging too far into this, but when you said date, I just—kind of, short circuited for a second,” Agatha starts with a dry laugh and everything spilling out before she can second guess it. Rio looks on as intently as ever, but her tongue is poking into the side of her cheek as a sure sign of her nervousness. Agatha decides there’s no way to break this gently. “I’m leaving Ralph."</p><p>“Oh,” is Rio’s initial reaction, but she doesn’t offer more than that. Agatha gathers that she’s choosing her reactions and her words diligently. It’s the first time that she’s noticed Rio’s capable of restraining herself and the thought unnerves her because she’s foolishly wishing for a sarcastic comment to ease her mind. </p><p>“It has nothing to do with this,” <em> Lie.</em> It has <em> everything </em> to do with this. “But I can’t continue this in good conscience if he’s still lingering around.”</p><p>Agatha motions between them. Rio nods, eyes following along the motion of her hand, but never moves to speak her mind. Rio being silent is more annoying than her actually trying to be annoying.</p><p>”Can I ask a question,” Rio says softly. Agatha nods. “What is this? What are we? Because you tell me you don’t want me and then you kiss me. And then you reject me. And then we start having sex and then we’re sleeping together. I wake up next to you and now we’re eating dinner together and you tell me you’re leaving your fiancé.” </p><p>The younger woman’s eyes widen and Agatha feels her heart start to race even faster. She grabs her glass of wine as a clutch, but doesn’t move it off the table. She just keeps it grasped firmly in her hand as a grounding source.</p><p>“I—I don’t know, Rio. Everything’s just happening so fast and there’s entirely too much at stake here, but… It’s nice to imagine being with someone who gets me like you do,” Agatha says as she looks onto Rio with the most intense gaze she’s given her thus far. Part of her thinks this is the one time in her life that she should’ve just kept herself unhappy—taken all the parts of Rio that were offered and been content. She could’ve lived a lie that only felt resolved when Rio was in her arms. It should’ve been enough.</p><p>She takes a thick swallow. “You scare the absolute shit out of me Rio, but somehow you make me feel alive. I used to dream about feeling like this—getting to be like this. And I don’t know what it means, but I don’t want to lose it. Whatever this is with you, I want it.” </p><p>Rio opens her mouth to speak for the first time but she promptly closes it. Agatha feels herself wanting to dig a hole under her seat big enough for her to crawl into and hide forever, but before she can ask Alice to grab her a shovel, Rio opens her mouth again, “One weekend. You spend one weekend with me and this is the result? You leave your fiancé and have this big epiphany?”</p><p>Agatha furrows her brows. She’d expected much different from the younger woman. She can start to feel the regret pile up in her throat, but then Rio cracks a smile. “We haven’t even scratched the surface yet, baby. Give me an entire month and I’ll have you forgetting what it was like before me entirely.”</p><p>A release of air comes crashing from Agatha’s lungs and it quickly shifts into a laugh of relief. God damn Rio. </p><p>“Your fucking unbelievable, Rio Vidal. I lay my heart on the line and—”</p><p>”And I feel the same way,” Rio quickly cuts her off. Agatha’s breath catches. “We don’t have to be anything but what we are right now. I know there’s a lot to figure out and a lot to consider, but… I wanna figure it out with you.”</p><p>Rio smiles nervously, but her cheeks are tinged pink revealing a glance of the way Agatha’s confession had truly made her feel. Even with the uncertainty in the back of Agatha’s head and the fear of the unknown, she’s never felt more sure of anything. She just needs time to get it right. And that’s exactly what she tells Rio. </p><p>“I don’t want to fuck this up, so just give me time to do this right.”</p><p>Rio nods softly, her eyes shining brightly. “So I finally get to be an older woman’s controversially young girlfriend,” Rio muses as she overlooks her menu. It’s like it’s an epiphany. “I’ve prayed for times like these.”</p><p>“<em>Girlfriend,</em>” Agatha questions with a smirk, though Rio doesn’t look up to see it. “Did you miss the part where I said I need time?”</p><p>Again, Rio doesn’t tear an eye away from her menu or twitch an annoying slim finger in her direction. “I heard you loud in clear but, I know I’m gonna be your wife one day. I wouldn’t get all knotted up about the girlfriend label.”</p><p>It’s said so matter of factly that Agatha’s breath catches. Twenty years with Ralph and being his wife felt like a formal obligation, but at the thought of being Rio’s wife—and it’s way too soon to even be humoring this—she’s already digging her heels into the altar. </p><p>“Rio, we’ve just established this is <em> maybe </em> our first date,” Agatha laughs, but the hopeful glint in her tone bleeds through. They’ve known each other for nearly two months and that’s plenty long right? </p><p>“Agatha, you’re an absolute firecracker. You’re fucking gorgeous. I’ve seen you naked multiple times and the sounds you make when you come are my favorite sounds in the world. I’m literally obsessed with you. You’re out of your mind if you think you’re going anywhere, Harkness,” the confidence shouldn’t be hot. It should be scary how the younger woman makes Agatha feel. Agatha Harkness should be running for the hills, not the altar. “Besides, I’m not the one leaving my fiancé after sleeping with the hottest twenty five year old I know. Very <em> Uhaul-esque </em> to me.”</p><p>“Careful darling,” Agatha muses with a warning glare. “Arrogance won't get you anywhere in life.”</p><p>Rio finally looks up to meet Agatha’s darkened blues, “It’s gotten me this far, hasn’t it?”</p><p>The sigh Agatha lets out is shaky and long, a true tell to the way Rio’s comments always hit their intended mark. “You’re always testing my patience, but today is a new record, Miss Vidal.”</p><p>“How far do I have to test it for you to skip this dinner and take me back to your bedroom, Ms.Harkness?”</p><p>Agatha bites her lip at the proposition. It’s entirely too tempting, but defiling Alice’s bar after a complimentary bottle of wine airs on the side of disrespectful. Fighting her disappointment, she shakes her head. “Why don’t we learn to walk before we run?”</p><p>“We’ve already done a lot of running, Agatha,” Rio quips. “Not to mention, we’re very familiar with bathrooms. We could sneak in there.”</p><p>“Even more of a reason to walk for a bit, my dear. Now look at your menu. I’m starving.”</p><p>Rio only pouts for a minute or two before she’s curiously looking up what branzino is on her phone like nothing ever happened. If Agatha stares at her in awe the entire time, it’s only because the restaurant is dimly lit and her forty-something year old eyes can’t see for shit.</p><p>Agatha decides to get a lemon crusted chicken dish and Rio settles on something a tish more greasy, a bacon cheese burger. The older woman makes a mental note to work on expanding Rio's palette. If not for the younger woman's sake then her own because watching Rio absolutely devour the burger in a stunning green dress is definitely not a sight she'd like to get used to, though she's starting to understand that when it comes to a lot of things Rio does, there isn't much she could do that Agatha wouldn't excuse.</p><p>There were a lot of times in Agatha's life where she attempted to change and control everything around her, in fact, it's still something she's all too familiar with. Rio is the first and only thing she's let control and change her. </p><p>“So Rio,” Agatha swallows a bite of her food, chucking softly as the younger woman reluctantly turns her attention from her dinner onto the woman across from her. “Why law?”</p><p>Rio takes a thick swallow of her burger, wiping her mouth with her napkin. “Oh. Thanks for waiting until I’ve digested my food to spur that on me.”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes fondly. “I didn’t realize dinner and conversation was something so challenging for you. NYU Law is not easy to get into. I’d hope you’d have better communication skills.”</p><p>“I just meant to at least let me swallow my bite,” Rio retorts with a fond laugh, folding her napkin and resting it across her lap. </p><p>Agatha laughs, “Okay then. You’ve swallowed, so why business and law? Is there a backstory there?”</p><p>“Do you want the long winded answer or the part where I just give you my standard ‘It’s my calling, answer,” Rio toys, but she looks onto Agatha like she’s trying to figure out an angle to take which leads the CEO to believe there’s a weight to something here. A burden she’s carrying and the older woman finds herself trying to soften her eyes and offer a warm, encouraging smile in hopes that it makes Rio feel a little lighter.</p><p>“I want to know everything there is to know about you Rio,” Agatha compliments simply, her voice low and soft. “I’d sit in this restaurant for the rest of my life if it meant you’d never stop talking about what it is that makes you you.” </p><p>Agatha sees Rio’s breath flutter as surprise etches onto her features. The older woman starts to wonder if she has ever had anyone show this much affection for her and then her heart starts to ache the longer she lets that thought sit. She wants to be the one to change that—needs to be. Rio certainly doesn’t need to be fixed but Agatha can understand feeling like there are parts of yourself that need to be. Agatha doesn’t know what it took to finally realize it, but Rio has unknowingly started mending those parts of her. She intends to return the sentiment.</p><p>”So it’s not an interesting one,” Rio finally says and her eyes seem to go blank all at once, almost spacing out as she focuses on the table in front of her. “I never knew what I wanted to do. I knew I enjoyed the arts and being creative, but I was also smart and loved to learn.”</p><p>“See, that’s what I thought,” Agatha comments after Rio closes her sentence, not wanting the moment to die. Any chance she can get to learn something about the younger woman she finds herself holding onto for dear life. “You’re incredibly professional around the office. It doesn’t surprise me that just anyone would think business is what you’re suited for. But then you geek out over a new video game or an article you’ve stumbled across and I just see a different spark there.” </p><p>Rio nods slowly, her eyes finding Agatha’s, “It took me a while to get that spark back.”</p><p>She goes quiet for a moment as if recalling a certain moment in time she wants to share, one that she feels most comfortable with opening up about. It’s only a few quiet seconds that pass before she seemingly settles on something and she sets back against her seat, “I met Matt after I came out as a lesbian to my adoptive parents. It was the summer after my senior year in high school.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitches at the sudden change in tempo, but she makes sure to lean a little closer over the table, reaching out to place her hand over Rio’s in silent support. She hadn’t known Rio was adopted.</p><p>“I thought it was time for a new beginning and things didn’t go the best…” She trails off, her eyes spacing out again. “After that, I just wasn’t the best person. I strained my relationship with my siblings. My parents kept them on tight leashes. I guess they were afraid I’d corrupt them. My brother was my best friend and he took it so hard, but my sister, she just pretended like I didn’t exist anymore and it was easier to just let her.”</p><p>If Agatha looked close enough, she could see the tears forming along the bridges of her eyes, but despite that, she kept her resolve. “I was ready to throw my life away and then this blind kid comes up to me while I’m in line at the grocery store and asks me if I’m single.”</p><p>The conversation starts to turn light, she even smiles as the memory resurfaces and Agatha drinks every single second in. </p><p>“And of course I’m so fucking caught off guard that the first thing I say is ‘<em>How do you know I’m not ugly?</em>”</p><p>A laugh bubbles from Agatha’s throat. She takes her thumb and starts to rub it alongside the back of Rio’s hand, “Oh honey, that’s so very you.”</p><p>“Wait until the next part,” Rio adds. “He then tells me ‘<em>You sound ho</em>t’ and I almost immediately say ‘<em>Do I sound like a lesbian? Because I am one</em>’” Rio’s laughing herself now, her cheeks rosy and her smile just a little brighter. “And he stops talking just for a second and I can see his stupid little smile on his face so I’m expecting some gross, cryptic comment but he just says, ‘<em>Can I interest you in a wingwoman position?</em>’ And that’s how I signed up to be his working eyesight for all of eternity… and unknowingly a career in law.”</p><p>Agatha nods along, her cheeks hurting from trying (and failing) to match the blistering smile on her companion's face. “So Matthew is the culprit? You were just trying to buy some milk and ended up hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt?”</p><p>Rio laughs, “Exactly that, though, there were a few more hoops to jump through. In the end, it just came down to him helping me realize I wasn’t a disappointment. That I hadn’t screwed up my life and there could be so much more ahead of me. Of course, we bonded over our crippling traumatic experiences and interest in sleeping with women, so that helped too.” </p><p>Agatha shakes her head, her lips tightening but a laugh leaving her despite her mock annoyance. “Remind me to keep an eye on you two.”</p><p>“You can certainly try,” Rio adds with a wink. “But seriously, when he told me to look into what I could do to help people in situations like me, I didn’t give it much thought. I knew he wanted to be a lawyer and that was something he felt passionate about, but me? I only felt passionate about my legacy save in the sims. But after a while, legally advocating for LGBT people started to sound kind of healing.”</p><p>And suddenly, everything about Rio starts to make sense. She is strong willed and compassionate because others need her to be. She’s smart and honest about the things she wants because there was a point in her life she couldn’t be. She’s got the world on her shoulders so that everyone else can feel just a little lighter and she doesn’t even flinch. It’s just who she is to her core. And she’s everything Agatha has felt she’s been missing because she simply is. She’s good. She’s kind and the world has given her a shitty hand but she’s made the most of it. It’s mind-numbingly alluring in all the ways that Agatha wishes didn’t affect her so deeply. Not when they’ve barely had time together. Not when she can’t have Rio the way she needs to. Not yet. </p><p>Agatha hadn’t realized it, but she’d been staring at Rio for the better half of two minutes in complete silence that was warming to her but nerve wrecking to the other party. She could tell immediately that Rio was worried she’d said too much too soon, that things were different now, but with a simple sigh and an endearing smile, the younger woman seems to relax.</p><p>Agatha wants to say a lot, but the only thing that comes to fruition is, “You're amazing.”</p><p>The flush on Rio’s cheeks gets impossibly darker as she allows herself to smile once more. Agatha raises her glass to signal for Rio to meet hers, to which she does almost immediately. Agatha takes note of the way her body seems to lighten, her hands holding her glass almost languidly. When it taps against her own, Agatha jokes, “To Matt Murdock.”</p><p>Rio just rolls her eyes. </p><p>“I’m kidding. He may have helped you onto the path, but the journey is all yours,” Agatha compliments fondly, not failing to miss the way Rio’s smile brightens. “To a strong, smart, and incredibly sexy future LGBT legal advocate.”</p><p>“You’re impossibile,” comes Rio’s reply, but it gets lost in her glass as she takes a sip.</p><p>”So I’ve been told,” Agatha quips, a coy smile sneaking into her lips. </p><p>It’s not even an hour later that Agatha backs Rio into the elevator of her building and is desperately grasping at any part of the younger woman to dig her nails into. Her hand reaches out blindly to press the button to her floor, but it’s the last thing on her mind to double check if she’s actually hitting the correct one. It’s hard to think about anything other than the way Rio’s lips are gliding over hers with her tongue teasing against them in earnest like it hasn’t been just a few hours since she’d done it last.</p><p>Agatha isn’t sure what part of her body is reacting the most, but the moans spilling from her throat are quite boisterous in comparison. Their hands are in a frenzy, never stopping in one place for too long. They had just eaten, but both of them are starving.</p><p>Rio hits up against the back of the elevator sending a yelp from her lungs, but it’s quickly swallowed by the older woman. Seconds later, Agatha’s hands are locked around Rio’s wrists like handcuffs and then raising them to pin them above her head. Agatha pushes against them firmly to hold them in place and leans in just inches away from the younger woman’s ear. </p><p>“I wanted to do this earlier when everyone was looking at you on the sidewalk,” Agatha says in a breathless whisper, the air hitting Rio’s ear hotly. She can feel the younger woman shiver under her touch. “I wanted to show them who you belong to. Let everyone see who’s slut you are.” </p><p>Rio whimpers, her hips involuntarily jutting out to nudge against Agatha. She’s a desperate puddle and Agatha just wants to soak it up like a sponge. The older woman sets her own hips forward and pins Rio fully against the wall. She doesn’t put up a semblance of a fight as she melts into Agatha’s touch like putty. It only serves to push the older woman on further.</p><p>“Because who do you belong to, Rio,” Agatha asks coyly, her hands tightening around the younger woman’s wrist. “I want to hear you say it.”</p><p>“I’m yours, Agatha,” Rio groans with no hesitation, her head falling back against the wall behind them and revealing more skin for Agatha to attach her lips onto. </p><p>“Good,” Agatha praises  against the raised skin of Rio’s neck. “Now I want my neighbors to hear it so there’s no confusion going forward.”</p><p>And then she backs away from Rio just as the doors behind them open. If Agatha could choose to hang a picture in The Louvre, it would be the mental image she’s saving of Rio at this exact moment. Desperation is the first adjective that comes to mind when she notices the way Rio’s chest is heaving, lips swollen and red, eyes dark and lidded. Agatha’s curling her finger to beckon Rio to follow without a second though. It’s no surprise that the younger woman tucks her tail and treads along behind the CEO like a puppy. </p><p>The door to Agatha’s apartment is the next surface that doesn’t stand a chance as they both collide against it as soon as they step inside. It’s undecided who initiated it first, but it’s a minor detail in the grand scheme of things. All Agatha knows is that she’s craving the taste of Rio. As much as she wants to remind Rio of who makes her come, she needs the reminder for herself as well.</p><p>“I’m going to taste you right here against this door,” Agatha says as she breaks away from Rio’s sweet, sweet lips. </p><p>“Wait,” Rio exclaims and Agatha pauses for a quick moment in surprise. “I need to hear you say it back.”</p><p>Agatha knits her brows, but she forgets it’s pitch black dark and there’s no way Rio can see her expression, but it’s futile to even try to speak because the younger woman is opening her mouth again, “I need to hear you say that I’m yours.”</p><p>And oh, Agatha gets it. But she’s not an easy buy. She should make Rio work for it. </p><p>“Beg,” it’s said simply, but the groan from Rio tells Agatha it packed a punch. </p><p>“<em>Please,</em>” Rio’s whimpering without hesitation. Her hands come up to wrap around Agatha’s neck and pull their lips together again hungrily. It happens so fast, the older woman short circuits for a moment and then Rio breaks away for a moment. “<em>Please, </em>Agatha. I want you to have me. <em> Please.</em> I’m yours.”</p><p>If Agatha was wet before, she’s the whole damn ocean right now. She has never wanted to own something so badly that her beliefs on feminism have been thrown into question. Her stomach is turning, her mouth is dry, but her body is fucking on fire. Her right hand comes to rest around Rio’s throat, her other hand digging into the skin of Rio’s exposed thigh as her dress is bunched around her hips, left leg thrown around Agatha’s backside to pull her closer. </p><p>Agatha is sure she’s never spoken with such conviction in her life. “You're mine.” </p><p>“<em>Fuck yes,</em>” Rio hisses. “I’m all fucking yours.”</p><p>The older woman is falling to her knees before she can even think. She’s still got Rio’s leg in her grasp, her hands latched around her ankle bone as she leans forward and places a kiss to the skin there. </p><p>“Mine,” she whispers against the skin. Rio’s heel moves to push painfully and deliciously into her chest as to keep her a short distance distant from the promised land. Agatha’s lips are kissing a wet, sloppy trail up from Rio’s ankle with her tongue dragging along the inner side of her knee and then into the muscle of her thigh. A slew of ‘mine’s’ leaving her tongue. </p><p>With each kiss, the younger woman lets her hold slack and grants Agatha permission to tread further. There’s no question as the wet here the older woman will take it. She’s moving along her path in earnest, moaning at the way Rio’s massaging her scalp encouragingly until she reaches her target. The younger woman’s leg is thrown over Agatha’s shoulder, opening herself up wide. And then that’s when she notices Rio had decided against any underwear and her slick, wet center is nearly sliding against the tip of the older woman’s nose. She feels drawn to it like a homing beacon and her tongue is lapping against it in seconds. Rio’s moans are filthy and loud, her promise to alert the neighbors taking precedence as Agatha’s name starts to slip through the cracks. </p><p>When Rio comes, Agatha loses track of how many times her name is called, but the pride in her chest swells all the same. She’s kissing against Rio with her arousal covered lips and it’s like a frenzy begins. The younger woman’s hands fist around the lapels of Agatha’s suit jacket and pull her close hard and fast. “I need you to fuck me, Agatha. Right now.”</p><p>And then Agatha hoists Rio up to wrap her legs around her waist and the younger woman finds herself moaning at the impressive display of strength. Agatha isn’t sure what possesses her, but she’s thankful for it nonetheless. She’s backtracking them to her bedroom with Rio’s hands fisting against her jacket as she throws it off behind them. Her nimble fingers are already working against the buttons of the older woman’s shirt as they cross the threshold of the room. </p><p>“What the <em> fuck?</em>”</p><p>It’s a deep voice. A familiar voice to Agatha, but Rio’s body still tenses at the sound. The older woman slips Rio down her legs, but it’s only a second later that she blinks and suddenly Rio’s pinned up against the wall by a shadow. </p><p>“That’s my fiancé, you <em> fucking </em> bitch.”</p><p>And Agatha’s world comes crashing down. </p><p>“Ralph, what the <em> fuck,</em>” Agatha screams and she’s launching forward to rip him away from the younger woman against the door. She can’t see either of them, which tells her neither can Ralph and he has absolutely no idea who he’s holding against their will. She’s got her hands wrapped around his biceps in an attempt to loosen his grip, but he swats her away. </p><p>“Shut the fuck up, Agatha,” Ralph hisses and Agatha starts to panic. The lights. The <em> fucking </em> lights. She’s dashing towards the light switch and nearly punching a hole in the wall with how much pressure she’s using to just get them cut on. When the light <em> finally </em> filters through the room, her heart clinches at the sight of Rio pinned against the door, Ralph’s body cowering over her as she tries her hardest to stand tall against her attacker. Her eyes are wide but her demeanor is tough and her lips are tinged red from… <em> blood? Is that blood?  </em></p><p>Agatha sees red.</p><p>Her fist is flying to Ralph’s face before she can stop it and the way he collapses against it makes her feel emboldened in a way she’s never felt before. She steps in front of Rio, shielding her from any further danger as Ralph turns towards them with her face in his hand. When he notices that it’s not a man behind Agatha, his eyes turn wide almost immediately. “Oh God, I’m so sorry. I didn’t—”</p><p>“If you ever touch her again, so help me god, it’ll be the last thing you ever do.”</p><p>Agatha isn’t sure if it’s hurt or confusion that flickers through his eyes, but she’s sure it’s a combination of the two after the way he straightens his posture and takes a couple steps forward. </p><p>“Are you serious right now,” he turns to look around Agatha at Rio, but the older woman takes a couple steps to the side to keep her protected. </p><p>“Go into the living room, Ralph,” she hisses. “We’ll talk in a minute.”</p><p>“You’ve got to be fucking kidding me.”</p><p>“Fucking go,” Agatha screams, reaching out and shoving him away from them by her hands falling flat against his chest. He stumbles back a few steps but the surprise in his eyes is evident. Agatha can’t even think straight as she sets her jaw, her fist clenching and unclenching against her sides. It feels like an eternity before he turns to sulk his way into the other room, but the moment he’s gone from her sight, she’s turning around to face Rio.</p><p>Agatha’s hand comes up to rest against Rio’s cheek, her thumb rubbing softly along her lips as she searches the younger woman’s face for any other sign of harm. </p><p>“I’m so fucking sorry, Rio,” Agatha whispers breathlessly, her eyes searching Rio’s for any anger or resentment, but she only finds that same soft look she’s learning to love. </p><p>“It’s okay,” Rio whispers back, nodding softly. “I bit my lip when I hit the door. It’s my fault. He didn’t hurt me.”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head but looks down to Rio’s arm where there is a sizable red mark from the devastatingly painful grip he’d had there. Her throat clenches and tears begin to well up in her eyes, she notices Rio begin to panic and it makes her feel even worse.</p><p>“Agatha,” she coos softly and Agatha is shaking her head viscerally as she backs away for a moment to put some space between them. There isn’t enough air in the room to help her breathe. </p><p>“Don’t Rio,” Agatha sighs though it comes out as more of a small wet sob. “This is my fault.”</p><p>She can hear the disproving sigh of Rio’s retaliation from here, but it falls on deaf ears. Just like everything else in her life, she’d managed to think she could have something solely to herself and not fuck it up. When her eyes find Rio’s again, the look behind them scares her. It’s so soft, almost dripping with pity. The silence that hangs between them is the most uncomfortable one thus far and it wraps its grimey little hands around Agatha’s throat to the point where she feels like she can’t breathe. It keeps her from saying anything—all the ‘<em>I’m sorry’s</em>’ dying on her lips. </p><p>When Rio smirks tightly at her, it holds an unspoken weight, but her words drop the hatchet, “I’ll see you tomorrow, okay?”</p><p>And then Agatha is panicking. Her feet are kicking into overdrive as she closes the gap between them and traps Rio’s face into her own shaky hands, “No. <em> No</em>. Please don’t leave me.”</p><p>It’s the most vulnerable she’s ever felt. She’s dangling herself off the ledge for Rio to save when she really just feels like letting herself go. She wants to fall backwards in slow motion as the last thing she sees before her back splatters against the ground is the younger woman looking at her like there wasn’t enough time for them. They should’ve had more time. How she’d managed to lose this woman after pondering marriage just two months into whatever fucked up relationship this was will stick with her until she leaves this cruel world. </p><p>“Oh <em> no,</em>” Rio’s eyes are wild, her hands mirroring Agatha’s and reaching up to hold Agatha’s face as to pull her undivided attention back. Her grip is firm and grounding as her eyes narrow down. “Stop self sabotaging. I’m here. I’m right here, Agatha. You have me. You <em> fucking </em> have me. I’m yours. Okay? I’m not leaving you.” </p><p>Her eyes are flickering back and forth from each of Agatha’s as they too begin to well up with tears. “You’re mine, Rio Vidal. I can’t—I can’t lose you. Not when I haven’t even had you yet.”</p><p>And Rio’s breath hitches, her eyes blinking her consciousness back into the present as she leans forward and pulls Agatha’s lips into a slow kiss. Rio tastes like blood and wine and Agatha never wants to stop. She <em> always </em> wants this. Call her pathetic and needy—whatever names that can fit into a punchline. Nothing will ever be able to reach her through the way she feels about this woman in her arms. </p><p>When their lips part and their foreheads rest together, Rio is the first one to speak, “You’ve always had me, Agatha. You’ve always <em> fucking </em>had me.”</p><p>Agatha nods and the relief that floods her body feels like a warm river on a summer day.</p><p>“Good. Now I’m going to get Matt to come walk me home. You talk to Ralph. Don’t worry about me. I’m okay,” Rio soothes as she leans forward and places a gentle peck against Agatha’s lips. </p><p>The older woman’s brow furrows as she pulls back to look at Rio. “My intern Matt? Isn’t he blind?”</p><p>Rio laughs, “Yes, he is. But he’s also my best friend and roommate. I have him well trained.”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, “Nonsense, I’ll get Christian—”</p><p>“<em>Agatha,</em>” Rio silences her. “He’ll take care of me. I promise.”</p><p>Agatha frowns and her heart clenches in her chest. “I should’ve taken care of you. I’m sorry—”</p><p>“Shut up,” Rio sticks a finger against Agatha’s lips. “You <em> do </em> take care of me in all the ways that matter. You’ll have time to make it up to me. I <em> promise </em> you.”</p><p>There were no qualms about Agatha going into the living room and ending her engagement with Ralph prior to the younger woman opening her mouth, but dare she say she’s now got an entirely new perspective on it. If there was uncertainty, Rio just pulverized it into non-existent pieces. </p><p>“Now kiss me goodbye and walk me to your door.”</p><p>She holds Rio’s hand in hers the entire way until they move to round the corner of the hallway and break into the living room. Agatha immediately misses the feeling as it was the only thing reminding her that despite what had happened, everything was going to be okay. Without it, her world feels like it’s collapsing and nothing will ever be fine again. She’d ruined—yet another—good thing in her life. She should’ve expected it.</p><p>She deserves this.</p><p>Ralph's eyes burn into the side of her face as she and Rio move towards the front door. It feels like time stops. Like a crossroads appeared out of thin air and the only two paths forward are her past and future. She looks at her feet as she opens the door for Rio, unable to look her in the eyes as if she’d been suddenly struck with shame. The last thing she feels is Rio’s thumb brushing over hers on the door knob as she takes it from her hand and closes it behind her. </p><p>The silence that lingers is far more uncomfortable than anything that has transpired so far, but it gives Agatha a second to find her bearings. With a deep breath and a quick straighten of her shoulders, she turns around to face the music. </p><p>“What happened to giving me the week,” Agatha laughs weakly.</p><p>“Looked to me like you figured it out in record time,” he quips, his hand nursing the side of his bruised face where Agatha’s knuckles had left quite a hefty mark. </p><p>In an effort to save time and face, Agatha doesn’t hesitate. “You knew this was over, Ralph.”</p><p>The way he lacks any sort of emotion towards that statement only confirms it further. He lets out a dry laugh and it hits it’s mark in the pit of her stomach.</p><p> “Yeah well, that doesn’t make it hurt any less that you’ve been cheating on me.”</p><p>Agatha hates that it hurts her. She shouldn’t care. She did this confidently so she should own up to it confidently, but hearing him say it with such disdain makes her feel like such a disgusting human being that the nausea hits her in waves. She hadn’t prepared to care like this. She wasn’t ready to see the tears in the blue eyes she once thought she loved dearly. </p><p>“I’m sorry,” She nearly whimpers. “I just wish you would’ve called first.”</p><p>“I live here too, Agatha,” he says, his shoulders slumping over as he sets his elbows on his knees. “Calling home so that I don’t catch my fiancé kissing someone else isn’t on my to do list.” </p><p>“I’m sorry for all of it, Ralph,” she means this one. With her whole entire chest she means it. </p><p>“I know you are.”</p><p>Agatha’s been standing across from him this whole time. The distance between them feels far greater than it actually is, but she hadn’t been conscious of the way she’d been standing over him, looking down on him. It suddenly hits her like a freight train that she’s watching someone’s life crumble. She’s responsible for this. He’d done nothing but do what he thought was right and she’d led him to this moment knowing that it would always come. He didn’t have a clue. </p><p>Her knees feel like they are going to crumble beneath her so she sits across from him on the ottoman facing the couch. He doesn’t look up to her, doesn’t even move an inch at her arrival, but it stirs something in him mentally.</p><p>“I know you only dated girls before me and well, now there’s…” he gestures between the two of them. “A girl after me, so I guess what I’m asking is, did you ever love me? Was any of it real?”</p><p>Agatha would’ve rather someone stick a hot branding iron across her chest leaving the words “cheater” charred into her skin than have to come face to face with the question that had been haunting her for years. Agatha is a lot of things, but being honest with herself hasn’t been one of them lately. </p><p>Agatha‘s whole life had been a series of challenges brought on by her mother’s unreachable high standards that always left her as the problem child—a disappointment. Up until college, she had lived by her mothers book, but once she had that taste of freedom she’d discovered a lot about herself. She just didn’t have time to fully understand it before her mother had shattered it.</p><p>So that’s when Ralph came into the picture and her mother’s words echoed into the back of her head and somehow, someway, Agatha was convinced this was God’s will. That Ralph was the one she needed. </p><p>And here she is twenty five years later, her mother long gone, but the trauma still ringing true as she looks to the man who was supposed to be the fix. He was supposed to be the one that made everything better—that made all the hurt and confusion make sense because it was God’s will. If not that then what?</p><p>Then <em> nothing</em>. That’s what it was. <em> Nothing</em>. </p><p>“I think that we were young Ralph,” Agatha decides to say, her voice teetering on a ledge.</p><p>”Oh <em> christ</em>,” Ralph spits as he runs a shaky hand through his hair.</p><p>“I’m serious,” Agatha’s voice raises. “There was so much for us to figure out. I didn’t understand myself yet and you came along and we had a lot in common. You were my best fucking friend.”</p><p>He blinks back tears as she notices his eyes gloss over with what she imagines to be the flashing of their relationship together. All the good and the bad. Is he seeing it too? She’ll relive this mistake every single day of her life. When she can’t bear to look at him any longer, she averts her eyes away. Agatha takes a painfully thick swallow. “That’s all we ever should’ve been.”</p><p>“We wasted so much time Agatha,” Ralph says, his voice rising, teeth baring down in an almost snarl. “I wasted so much time on you.” </p><p>“I know,” is all she can bring herself to say. It doesn’t feel like enough. She knows it’s not enough. It will never be enough. </p><p>”No you <em> don’t </em>” his spits, voice laced with venom and as much as Agatha would like to bite back, she doesn’t. She takes it. Every ounce of his anger, she holds space for because up until this moment, she hadn’t even planned for it. “You get to leave this life behind, go off into the sunset with your young piece of ass—”</p><p>“That’s not what she is—”</p><p>”I don’t care, <em> Agatha. </em>I get to—<em>what</em>? Hope that I can let this go? Pretend that this life didn’t mean everything to me at one point,” Agatha can see the tears treading down his face, the way he’s baring his jittering teeth as he tries his hardest not to fall apart. “ <em> Fuck </em> Agatha, I was going to marry you.” </p><p>On the contrary, she can count on her hand the amount of times this man has seen her cry, but she’s not thinking about any of them as the tears begin to stream down her reddened cheeks unabashedly. He’s right. But there’s nothing she could ever say to make it better. She doesn’t have the right words and it’ll take her far too long to find them. But she knows that <em> he </em>knows it too. He looks at her for the first time since he’d looked away and his eyes are so heavy that Agatha swears she can feel the weight in his gaze alone. He looks tired. Disappointed. But hurt most of all. Something Agatha’s features mirror, but lack in comparison to. He doesn’t speak. He barely even moves, but the small movement he does make is to lose the distance between them so that his words come out as a whisper. </p><p>“Take care of yourself, Agatha.”</p><p>It’s decided that Ralph will pack his things and leave the apartment to Agatha because, one, it was hers first and two, he couldn’t afford it on his own. There aren’t any pictures of them on the walls or really any indications that she’d had a fiancé living with her at all, so the only thing that shifts in her life is the cup in the bathroom holds only one tooth brush. The key bowl next to the door only holds one set of keys and the space in her closet is now void of men’s clothing. </p><p>For the first time in twenty years, Agatha is physically <em> and </em>emotionally alone.</p><p>She feels numb at first. The tears don’t come and the thoughts never stop to give her time to mourn them. She sinks into a bed that feels far too big for her, but somehow she’s still suffocating in it. She sees flashes of Ralph and then flashes of Rio and she’s reminded of how much she’s fucked up. Something she knew was going to happen but let it occur anyways. </p><p>Needless to say, sleep doesn’t come easy. </p><p align="center">—</p><p>Agatha stops wearing her engagement ring. </p><p>In hindsight, she should’ve stopped wearing it a long time ago, but it had become such an integral part of her wardrobe that it was muscle memory to a certain point. She didn’t realize how much she’d depended on it until she made a pointed effort to leave it off this morning.</p><p>She isn’t sure how closely people have paid attention to her in the past, but she becomes extremely aware of it now. She tends to talk with her hands. She’s a very animated person. She hadn’t realized how much she flung them about until she made an effort to try and keep her hands in her pockets for most of the day. She also hasn’t realized how much she’d come to want Rio’s company. </p><p>Spending the weekend with her felt like an eternity's worth of time and it still wasn’t enough. She feared it would never be enough. Instead of talking herself into another crash out, she decides to seek out Rio if not to soothe her own anxiety, but to also apologize again for the things that happened. The whole situation hasn’t set right with her since she saw Rio out of the door. She hadn’t heard from her either and the sickening thought of losing the woman she’d risked and lost everything for settles into her mind. </p><p>She finds the younger woman next to the coffee machine after lunch and tries to talk herself out of approaching her, but Agatha’s not going to be able to get any work done unless she attacks the elephant in the room. She takes two steps towards Rio before the younger woman turns around to face her. Her hair is half up into a bun, half down and running over a suit jacket that’s covering… is that Agatha’s shirt? The shirt she’d obviously stolen after their hookup on Friday night.</p><p>There’s an inviting smile on Rio’s face as she turns towards her boss. “Good afternoon, Ms. Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha can hear the ripples of uncertainty in her voice and she yearns to fix it. If she can’t fix Ralph, she can fix this and this matters to her far more in comparison, Agatha reaches out to straighten the collar of <em> her </em> button up shirt on Rio’s body and lets her fingers slide over the fabric. She notices throat tighten at the proximity. “I need to talk to you. Privately.” </p><p>“Talk,” Rio questions with that uncertainty still laced into her tone. </p><p>“Yes,” Agatha confirms with a gentle nod. “Just talking. Come to my office in ten minutes.”</p><p>Agatha sits in her office for the entire ten minutes wondering if it’s too late to back out or if she’s even ready for this conversation she’s thrusted them into—both literally and figuratively. When Rio wraps her knuckles against the glass, Agatha knows it’s now or never. </p><p>She waves the younger woman in and Agatha can tell Rio’s trying her best to not appear as nervous as the CEO is sure she feels, so in an effort to avoid keeping their nerves in knots, she takes a deep breath and goes to open her mouth—</p><p>“If you say ‘I’m sorry’ again, I’ll make you wish you hadn’t.” </p><p>And Agatha is so surprised by Rio’s sudden outburst that she laughs and out with it comes all of her anxiety she’d been harboring for hours. Rio isn’t so amused, but that’s to be expected of course.</p><p>“I know. I’m not going to say it anymore I promise. I just wanted to clear the air,” The tension dissipates much quicker than it sets in. The room feels brighter despite how the sadness inside her still looms. She rises from her desk and circles around it to stand promptly in front of the intern, a respectful space between them. “He’s gone.” </p><p>There’s a flash of surprise over Rio’s features before she nods softly. “How did that go? Are you okay?”</p><p>Agatha nods, but it’s less convincing than she’d hoped. Rio looks around the room for a moment and takes note of the blinds covering the windows before she reaches out and grabs Agatha’s left hand. She looks down at the bruises formed on her knuckles and brushes her thumb over them softly before bringing them up to her lips to press a feather light kiss. Agatha’s breath catches and her eyes threaten to form those tears that had yet to come. “I know but you were together a long time. It’s okay to be a little sad.”</p><p>“I just wasted so much time, Rio.”</p><p>It’s said so softly that had Rio not have been staring at Agatha’s lips so intently she might’ve missed it. But the look on her face tells Agatha she’s glad she didn’t as she steps forward and tucks a finger under the older woman’s chin, pulling their eyes to meet. </p><p>“You are exactly where you’re supposed to be,” and the way she says it makes Agatha believe it. Down to her very core she’s starting to believe it. “And you and I… have all the time in the world for our story.” </p><p>A gentle tear makes it’s way down Agatha’s cheek but it’s quickly wiped away by the pad of Rio’s thumb as the younger woman moves to cup Agatha’s face into her hands. The CEO melts into the touch, her body relaxing for the first time in hours. Rio moves forward to place a kiss against the crown of Agatha’s head before pulling back and looking onto the woman softly, “I understand if you need time, but I’ll wait for you for however long it takes.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile is bright through her teary eyes as she leans forward and connects her lips with Rio’s hands coming up to cover the younger woman’s around her face. They stay there for a moment. Pressed together in a moment so intimate, it shouldn’t be shared at work but something about having it in the exact spot they’d met feels like poetic justice. </p><p>When they part, their foreheads rest together, eyes stay shut to hold on to the moment a bit longer until Agatha speaks, “Come over to my place for dinner soon. Please?” </p><p>“Okay, so long as you promise no surprise WWE performance on your part,” Rio laughs softly and the sound of their giggles intertwine though part of Agatha still grimaces. </p><p>“I promise,” Agatha confirms and fights the words ‘I’m sorry’ from advancing their way from her throat, yet again. “I just want to make it up to you for yesterday.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes are soft. “You have nothing to make up for.”</p><p align="center">—</p><p>Agatha goes home to an empty house for the first time in nearly twenty years. Her first thought is it’s too quiet, but she quickly reminds herself it’s always been this quiet—with or without Ralph. He was a ghost in her life. A lingering reminder of who she’d never be, but so desperately was trying to. </p><p>Now what did she have? A failed engagement, a mistress, and a multimillion dollar apartment stained with the memories of a life she once lived. </p><p>She did her usual routine of coming home, ridding herself of her clothes and taking a scalding hot shower to make sure her skin stings more than the hurt in her chest. </p><p>It surprised her—the hurt. She hadn’t expected to care that Ralph wasn’t a part of her life anymore and to be quite honest, she’s not so sure that's why she’s even hurting in the first place. Somewhere inside her chest there is definitely remorse, but taking up far more space is the pain of wasted time. The pain of young Agatha who yearned for this life, this freedom, but was too beaten down to fight for it. </p><p>So if she cried in the shower, it wasn’t for Ralph. It was for her. </p><p>Her night got infinitely better when Rio’s name popped up on her phone screen like some high schooler giggling in their room before class the next day. Despite the cliche, she picked it up immediately.</p><p>”Hey,” Agatha says softly as she tucks herself into her cool sheets, pulling her duvet up to her chest and hugging it into herself. </p><p>“Hey you,” Rio’s soft voice breaks through the line and Agatha melts into it. “I just wanted to check on you and see how you were doing?”</p><p>And this is new—having someone that cares. When Agatha speaks, she tries not to let her voice crack with emotion. “I’m okay. It’s just weird.”</p><p>”Yeah, I get that.” </p><p>A silence lingers for a moment. It’s not uncomfortable, but Agatha can tell it’s taken with intention. Rio’s thinking and what she says could be the push over the edge that Agatha’s trying to avoid so desperately. Rio has a way of getting under her skin effortlessly.</p><p>”Agatha,” Rio says almost as a whisper and the older woman’s breath catches as if she’d been caught. She doesn’t answer, but Rio didn’t seem to need one. “I’m proud of you.” </p><p>Agatha could stop the tears from pooling if she tried to. She cracks completely. Her heart rips out of her chest and if Rio were standing in front of her, it would’ve been delivered on a silver platter. Out of everything Rio could’ve said, that was the least expected by far. Agatha doesn’t know what to do or what to think. She’s always been the one to make the moves and pick herself back up when she’s broken, but with the way Rio makes her feel, it’s like she’s finally not alone. </p><p>And Rio’s not one to let a silence hang too long. “I just thought you should know that.”</p><p>And Agatha’s chuckle is wet and thick with emotion that takes both of them by surprise. “You have no idea how much it means to hear that, Rio.”</p><p>The younger woman sighs like an unbearable weight has lifted off of her shoulders and her voice is strong and steady—a lifeline Agatha hadn’t expected but now isn’t sure how she lived without it. “I’ll tell you as many times as you need me to.”</p><p>Agatha smiles through her tears. “Can you tell me a story instead? It can be about anything. I just want to listen to your voice right now.”</p><p>It’s by far one of the most intimate things she has said to the intern, but it’s like Rio doesn’t even bat an eye. Se heard Agatha needed something and she’d wasted no time in making sure she got exactly what she needed. </p><p>Agatha ends up hearing a story about how Rio had gotten in trouble for cutting her sisters hair when she was little that somehow lead into the first time she’d tried pot brownies, but she’s sure she’s never slept sounder in her entire life.</p><p align="center">—</p><p>When Agatha gets to work the next day, there’s a coffee on her desk with a black heart drawn on the side. She traces her thumb over the ink like some part of Rio might be hidden in it. She doesn’t see her throughout the day, but she feels her deep in her chest in a way that should scare her, but it doesn’t. </p><p align="center">—</p><p>She calls Rio on the way home and they talk the entire way. They talk while Agatha makes dinner and Rio criticizes how Matt’s making theirs. They stay on the phone as they eat in silence, the presence of one another serving as enough. Agatha finds excuse after excuse to keep Rio on the phone and the younger woman lets her without question. </p><p>Even as she tucks herself into bed, Rio stays. She doesn’t say anything that’s not asked of her and Agatha knows she’s making sure to avoid asking the questions she really wants to ask. </p><p>Agatha tucks that knowledge away for later and listens to the sound of Rio’s soft breathing as she sleeps on the other side of the line. </p><p>She goes to sleep feeling full in the emptiest her home as ever been. </p><p align="center">—</p><p>It’s two days later when Agatha slips up and mentions she hasn’t really eaten in the last couple of days save for a granola bar and protein shake from the vending machine downstairs. They’re standing in the break room listening to the quiet drip of the coffee maker and there’s just enough distance between them that Agatha can see Rio’s eyes darken at the first mention of her mistake as if anger had clouded her judgement.</p><p>And then they soften and pair with Rio’s warm smile as she pulls out her phone to begin typing away at something. “Well, that just won’t do.” </p><p>And then thirty minutes later there’s a burger and fries with Agatha’s name on it sitting on her desk. As she looks in the bag, her phone buzzes on the desk next to it and she briefly peers down to see a message from Rio—rather a warning:</p><p><em> Eat. I’m watching you. </em>  </p><p>Agatha looks up through her office door to see Rio standing at Wanda’s desk, obviously in conversation but she turns her head for just a moment to narrow her eyes at her boss. The older woman makes sure to pop a fry in her mouth where Rio can see it and she rewarded with that bright smile she’s starting to love so much.</p><p align="center">—</p><p>Rio shows up to Agatha’s apartment a week later at a prompt six thirty to the smell of yet another gourmet meal being prepared at the hands of one talented CEO. The older woman hears Rio enter this time and doesn’t have to attach herself to the nearest utensil she can use as a weapon, much to Rio’s disappointment. </p><p>“What? No knife this time,” the younger woman pouts and Agatha just throws a cherry tomato across the island to promptly smack Rio between the eyes with. She laughs as the tomato rolls away in the abyss and Rio wags a ‘naughty’ finger before she starts to run towards her. Agatha takes off in the other direction, wooden spoon in hand as both women straddle opposite ends of the kitchen island in a standoff. </p><p>“Stay back,” Agatha warns with a point of the wooden spoon.</p><p>“Don’t threaten me with a good time,” Rio says as she makes a quick fake dash to the right before switching gears and turning left leaving Agatha completely confused and barreling right into Rio’s arms. The younger woman picks her up and spins her around in the air, their giggles spilling out into one another.</p><p>“Put me down” Agatha yelps as she kicks her feet out helplessly to which Rio just begins to tickle into the older woman’s sides.</p><p>“Say that you’re sorry.”</p><p>“Okay, okay! I’m sorry,” Agatha says easily, but Rio doesn’t relent right away. Instead she stops her attack on the older woman’s sides, but keeps her pressed tightly towards Rio’s front, legs still raised above the ground and plants a soft kiss on Agatha’s lips. And then she sets her back down softly with a smile.</p><p>“See, you can be nice sometimes,” Rio muses as she pokes Agatha against her cheek before her hand is swatted away with the spoon.</p><p>“Go sit over there and be good, why don't ya’.”</p><p>“Yes dear,” Rio coos softly as she takes her seat around the side of the island and watches Agatha work intently. The meal was basically ready, so she’s only plating it for them, but she still takes her time with it as though it were an art form in and of itself.</p><p>When she slides Rio’s plate towards her and offers her a glass of wine, the slew of compliments are already leaving the younger girl’s lips before she can even sit down next to her. Agatha’s heart instantly feels warm and her entire body buzzes with excitement at the possibility of having this be her new normal. She craves this feeling like she craves Rio’s company—wholeheartedly. </p><p>As she takes her seat next to Rio, she looks to the younger woman and smiles to herself at the way she stuff her face with a meal she definitely doesn’t even know the name of, but Agatha made it so that’s all that matters. There’s a trust there that goes without saying and it’s never, in Agatha’s forty some years, hit the mark quite like Rio has managed to do. </p><p>“I can feel you staring creep,” Rio laughs, but when she turns to look the CEO in the eyes, Agatha doesn’t budge. Brief moments of Rio taking care of her these last two weeks cross her mind and her heart thuds in her chest.</p><p>She didn’t have to do anything at all, but she did. She stepped up when no one did. She made sure Agatha ate and always kept her company even when she couldn’t physically be there with her. She kept her laughing and entertained with stories Rio would’ve never utter otherwise just to make sure she was happy.</p><p>And now she’s here, sitting in Agatha’s kitchen with sauce on her cheek and Agatha commits every facet of Rio’s face to memory as she says the words that have been stuck in her throat </p><p>“Be mine,” Agatha whispers between them. A brief moment of confusion stutters across Rio’s face as she swallows her bite of food.</p><p>“I thought we already established this?”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head. “No. Be mine.”</p><p>Rio raises an eyebrow before a smile cracks across her sauce ridden face, “Are you asking me to be your girlfriend, Agatha?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha says bewildered. “Yeah, I guess I am.”</p><p>”Shouldn’t you wait until you at least sign the divorce papers? You know, just to be sure.”</p><p>It’s a joke. Of course it is, but there’s a hint of insecurity there that Agatha picks up on almost immediately and her palms are placed against Rio’s cheeks in an instant. Her thumbs rub against the red skin soothingly, her eyes search against the deep browns in front of her, hoping to convey the seriousness in which she means every word she says.</p><p>”I know things are moving quick, but I…” Agatha trails off, her teeth trapping her bottom lip as Rio’s eyebrows knit together. Agatha can feel the younger girl nuzzle into her palm encouragingly. It breaks Agatha immediately. “I’m so sure about you, Rio.”</p><p>Agatha can feel Rio’s breath catch as she continues, “I’ve wasted so much time, Rio. I’m nearly fifty years old and I’ve made so many mistakes that I can’t make up for, but somehow, every single one led me to you. And I don’t deserve you. Not by a long shot, but for some reason you’re here in my kitchen right now and you haven’t left, so I’m not wasting any more time pretending like my feelings for you aren’t serious.” </p><p>Rio pauses only for a moment to reel in her clear excitement as she leans forward to capture Agatha lips into a searing kiss that tastes like sauce, wine and a new beginning.</p><p>“Is that a yes,” Agatha asks as they break. Her smile is blinding, though Rio’s is considerably brighter as she responds,</p><p>“Of course it is,” Rio exclaims as she leans forward to steal yet another kiss that is nearly broken up by each of their smiles being too wide at times. Agatha hasn’t even taken a bite of her food yet, but she’s never felt more full. “Now eat your damn dinner so you can take your girlfriend to bed, sweetheart.”</p><p>When they fall into bed just a short time later, things don’t feel as rushed as they normally do. It feels like there are extra promises garnered into their touches and within their lingering kisses. It feels like this moment has all the time in the world to last and nothing could ever break into the space to make them feel any differently. When Agatha comes first, it’s electric and riveting, Rio seemingly knowing exactly what she’d needed the entire time. But when Rio comes, it’s with Agatha’s hips pumping inside of her, those dark brown eyes latch onto Agatha’s blues and her legs wrapped so tightly around the small of Agatha’s back that she feels like there’s no definitive separation between the two. Their hands are clasped together on the pillow beside Rio’s head and the breathless whisper of <em> mine </em> leaves Agatha’s lips as <em> yours </em> filters back.</p><p>It’s some few hours later that Agatha finds herself being lulled to sleep by the quiet sounds of Rio’s breathing as she lays her head on the woman’s bare chest, her body tucked into the younger woman’s side. Rio’s running her nails through Agatha’s tresses absentmindedly and it was up until this point that Agatha is sure she’s never been so comfortable in her <em> own </em> bed. </p><p>In the quiet, she thinks back to the way Rio opened up to her yesterday and how much it meant to her—to learn something so vital to the younger woman. Knowing now that Rio was adopted and banished by her family only made Agatha want to hold her closer to not only keep her tight in her grasp but to also simply say “I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p>“Hey Rio,” Agatha whispers into the crook of Rio’s neck to test the silent waters around them and she finds herself fighting a smile as she receives a content hum in return. She takes that as an okay to continue. “Thank you for being there for me.”</p><p>”There was no where else I wanted to be.”</p><p>A silence hangs between them for a moment and for the first time, Rio lets it be. She tangles her fingers in the end of Agatha’s hair and places feather light kisses to the crown of Agatha’s head every now and again like a reminder that she’s still not leaving.</p><p>Agatha briefest wonders how anyone could think Rio is anything but amazing. “You know they were wrong about you—Your parents.”</p><p>She’s not sure where it came from but it spilled out like a reflex. Agatha can feel the way Rio stiffens under her for a moment, her and she quickly wraps her arms tighter around Rio’s midsection in silent support. </p><p>Rio doesn’t answer right away, but when she does, Agatha barely catches it, “Yeah, I know.”</p><p>The older woman isn’t content with the answer, but she doesn’t push it further out of the fear of pushing it too far. The absolute last thing she wants to do is make Rio uncomfortable. The quiet that settles between them once more is thick and unwelcome and it starts to claw at Agatha’s throat. She finds herself wanting to open up—to empathize. Her words are fumbling out of her mouth before she can stop them. </p><p>“You know, my mother was a real bitch too,” Agatha laughs dryly, her fingers starting to draw circles against Rio’s chest. “She made every day of my life a living hell just by breathing.”</p><p>This is the first time she’s ever openly told anyone about her mother besides Jen and even then she kept it to a minimum. Jen was her roommate in college and when the entire coming out debacle happened she became privy to most of Agatha’s past. The older woman is sure that was the last time she’d ever let anyone in. Not even Ralph had opened her up. </p><p>“She was a diehard catholic to the core. All her values and beliefs… they did quite the number on me,” she hears a soft chuckle leave Rio as the woman continues to comfortingly thread her fingers through Agatha’s hair. “Everyday I heard how much of a disappointment I was. I took too long to tie my shoes. I didn’t read my homework fast enough. I wasn’t the first kid in the neighborhood to learn how to ride a bike. It didn’t matter what, I was always behind in her eyes.”</p><p>“She sounds like a nightmare,” Rio comments, to which Agatha hums against her neck, tucking her nose further into the warm crevice and allowing herself to inhale the scent of Rio as she brings up these memories.</p><p>”Yeah,” Agatha adds as she releases a deep breath. “When I went away to college, it was the first breath of fresh air I ever had.”</p><p>“Is this the part where you tell me this is where learned how to expertly sleep with women,” Rio toys, but her tone is soft and it’s clearly an attempt to lighten the heavy air around them and for that, Agatha is grateful.</p><p>”You betcha,” Agatha huffs out a dry laugh, but it fizzles out quickly into an almost distasteful cough. “I was a fire you couldn’t put out. I had my taste of freedom and I hit the ground running. It didn’t take me long to realize I was a lesbian.”</p><p>She can feel Rio go still beneath her once more and she knows what’s coming before it’s even asked, “Lesbian? But Ralph?”</p><p>Agatha nods. “Some things you just have to repress when your mom’s a religious nut. My dad died while I was away at college. We weren’t close. He wasn’t present in any of my life, but my mom made the trip to campus to tell me.” Agatha swallows thickly. “That’s when she found me in bed with my girlfriend.”</p><p>”Oh,” she hears Rio whisper softly. Agatha wonders if it’s in awe of just how easily their past intertwines because she’s had that epiphany too.</p><p>“I don’t know why, but I let her convince me—well her and her priest—that I needed help. That this wasn’t who I was supposed to be.”</p><p>Rio says with a soft sigh, “What a fucking bitch.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha comments, her mind distant. “I could say all my problems went with her when she died.”</p><p>”That would be too easy, wouldn’t it,” Rio says fondly, her lips leaning down to place a lingering kiss on the top of Agatha’s head. It’s an affirmation that she’s listening, understanding even and it means more than she’ll ever know. </p><p>”Way too easy,” Agatha confirms, leaning into Rio’s affection. “I think it did heal me in some way though. I went to therapy for a long time and worked through my feelings. I’m still not so sure it wasn’t all bullshit, but it made me not hate my life everyday I woke up.”</p><p>Rio adjusts herself so that her chin is resting against Agatha’s forehead. “But you still stayed with <em> him</em>? After therapy?”</p><p>Agatha sighs disappointedly, “I wish I could tell you why, but even I don’t know. I think I was just comfortable. Maybe even too tired to try and fix it.”</p><p>Agatha can feel Rio nod. “I can understand that.”</p><p>”All that just to say, I can understand feeling like a failure to your parents—feeling like you’ll never live up to what they would’ve wanted for you,” Agatha finally gets to her point and she shuffles out of the crook of Rio’s neck to look down at her, a hand coming up to rest on Rio’s warm cheek. “We are so much more than what our parents wanted. Better even. And I can’t wait to see you help others like us. You’re going to be amazing. You <em> are </em> amazing.”</p><p>Even in the dark, Rio’s eyes are shinning bright as they look onto her. Agatha immediately feels a warmth envelope her, pulling at her chest and tugging against her rib cage. It’s sudden and loud and she feels like she simultaneously can’t breathe or fill her lungs with anymore air. The smile tugging at Rio’s lips meets her tired eyes and it’s everything Agatha can do to not slip up and say something stupid to this woman she’s inevitably falling for without question. </p><p>Instead, she leans forward and slowly kisses the smile off of Rio’s lips, humming into it as the feeling of the younger woman’s nails raking against her scalp comforts her. When they part, Agatha has to giggle at the way Rio can barely keep her eyes open, but is clearly fighting the urge to rest just so she can look at Agatha just a bit longer. The older woman’s does her the favor and settles back down into her warm nesting spot against Rio’s side so that sleep can overcome them both, but before Rio knocks out completely, she mutters, “Thank you for sharing that with me.”</p><p>And Agatha feels it again. That pull in her chest that just won’t leave. Somehow, someway, Rio is going to untangle every complicated mess inside of her without even lifting an intentional finger. </p><p>And Agatha just might let her. </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>It’s no surprise that Agatha wakes up next to Rio bright and early the next morning. It’s a sight that will never, ever tire out—raven hair splayed across the pillows, tan skin hidden under starch white bedding and that damn tattoo on her back calling out to Agatha’s lips like a homing beacon. Her only knit pick is that waking up next to the younger woman on a weekday means she can’t spend the entirety of her day fucking the woman within an inch of her life. Instead she has to find the will to pull herself out of bed at the ungodly hour of six am when every bone in her body aches to just pull Rio tighter and doze off for just a little longer. </p><p>After an extremely treacherous and tedious five second battle with herself, she decides ten more minutes wouldn’t hurt. So she tucks her arm around Rio’s waist and moulds herself against the warm skin of the younger woman’s back, dropping her lips down to press a soft kiss to her shoulder blade before tucking into the nape of her neck with her nose. </p><p>There’s a small hum in response and a subtle shift backwards into Agatha’s grip, but Rio doesn’t stir and that lulls the older woman back into a short, undisturbed nap for all of the ten minutes she had allowed herself. When she wakes, she makes one small move to pull away from the younger woman and she barely even puts an inch between them when Rio’s grasping at her wrist and tugging her back in.</p><p>“No, stay,” comes Rio’s honey dipped voice.</p><p>Agatha’s heart strings tug. And just like that, every meeting she has scheduled, every phone call, every single email that’s calling her name, it’s pushed back an hour. She stays until the very last possible moment, with her arms and heart completely full and nose surrounded with the scent of eucalyptus shampoo. </p><p>They finally begin to stir and move from their own domestic bliss when the call of their professional lives becomes too loud to ignore. Agatha brushes her lips against the side of Rio’s warm, red cheeks and whispers, “Good morning to my beautiful <em> girlfriend</em>.”</p><p>The small giggle she receives in response is enough to carry her throughout the rest of her morning with a smile, but the low whisper of Rio’s raspy morning voice is what sends her over the edge. </p><p>“Good morning to my… <em> future wife</em>,” It’s said with a joking lilt but Agatha’s heart knows no difference. </p><p>“I don’t see a ring on either of us yet, so let’s pump the brakes a bit,” the older woman laughs and Rio stirs in her arms to turn and face her for the first time and Agatha’s breath stutters at her warm rich eyes.</p><p>“You and I both know I have no problem <em> UHauling </em> this thing, so I suggest you choose your words wisely,” Rio warns with a smile as bright as the sun peaking over her shoulders from the windows behind her. She leans forward and places a small peck on Agatha’s lips. “I’m fucking obsessed with you.”</p><p>The older woman chuckles. “Is that so?”</p><p>“<em>Mhmm</em>,” Rio nods through a yawn. “I don’t know if you noticed but I’ve been trying to wife you up since day one.” </p><p><em> She’s succeeded at every turn</em>, Agatha thinks to herself, but just audibly brushes it off with a laugh. She reaches out and tucks a strand of loose hair behind Rio’s ear and then leans forward to brush a soft kiss to the tip of her nose as she goes to remove herself from the bed. She’s completely nude and the cold air hits her skin fast and unwelcome, but Rio’s soft whispers as she too pulls herself from the covers warm her back up with a bright flush of red across her skin.</p><p>“I think I’d make a good trophy wife,” Rio mindlessly hums to herself as her feet hit the floor. She’s clearly not happy that Agatha had nothing to say to her comment. “Have I not succeeded in being the best girlfriend you’ve ever had?” </p><p>She sulks over to her pile of clothes. “And girlfriend of <em> one </em> night by the way. I’ve been a side piece for months.”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes and disappears into her closet, but even through her thick walls she can hear the remnants of Rio’s fit still being thrown to its fullest extent. The older woman is halfway to picking out an outfit for herself when she hears a clatter in her room and she cautiously peers around her door to find Rio standing in the corner of her room, buttons to <em> Agatha’s </em> shirt misaligned as she struggles to hop through one leg of her pants. </p><p>“<em>Baby</em>,” Agatha sighs as she approaches the woman. She sets the shirt on the hanger that she’d been preparing to wear on the end of her bed and reaches out to unbutton the shirt with her fingers. The pet name doesn’t go unnoticed by Rio as a crimson blush breaks out across her cheeks. “You’re <em> really </em> selling me on the trophy wife piece.”</p><p>“I’ve barely had my eyes open for ten minutes. Cut me some slack,” Rio whispers through her smile as she watches the care in Agatha’s demeanor upon fixing her mess of a wardrobe.</p><p>Agatha slides the shirt off of her shoulders and lets her eyes linger on the expansive tan skin that is Rio’s breasts trapped behind a beautiful black lace bra that Agatha hadn’t noticed prior to it being ripped off in the dark last night. </p><p>She sighs to herself as her stomach starts to twist, “What am I gonna do with you, Rio Vidal?”</p><p>“Marry m—”</p><p>Agatha shushes Rio with a finger to her lips. “I should’ve known.”</p><p>The sparkle in Rio’s eyes is inviting and entirely too encouraging as Agatha turns her back on the woman and reaches for the black button up she’d planned to wear, but has now decided it’d be better for Rio as she can’t possibly go to work with the same shirt on. </p><p>“What are you doing,” Rio asks curiously as she watches Agatha pick the shirt form the hanger and trepse back over to in front of her. </p><p>“I can’t send my <em> girlfriend </em> to work in the same shirt as yesterday. That just simply won’t do,” the older woman <em> tsks </em> her tongue as she hands the shirt over to Rio. </p><p>The younger woman takes it immediately with another beaming smile and begins to thread her arms through the sleeves. “This is soft.”</p><p>“It’s Dior baby,” Agatha comments as she steps forward to take the front of the shirt into her hands yet again and begins to fixate the buttons correctly for the younger woman. Rio just rocks back and forth on her heels in contentment until the older woman finishes the final button and smooths her hands over the collar until they reach out the back of Rio’s neck. She rests them there, threading them through the hair on the nape of her neck as she pulls her down into a soft kiss. Rio hums, her lips sliding against Agatha’s on autopilot. “Only the best for you.”</p><p>When Agatha pulls away, she whispers ever so softly against soft lips, “You were <em> never </em> the side piece, Rio.”</p><p>Her blue eyes are stoic and strong looking into Rio’s browns. If the younger woman believes nothing else from this conversation, she better walk away believing that fact. By the thick swallow she takes and the softening of her smile, Agatha is hopeful the message was received. </p><p>“You know I’m just messing with you about the ‘wife’ stuff, right,” Rio says to which Agatha just shakes her head.</p><p>“No you’re not.”</p><p>“Yeah, I’m really not.”</p><p align="center">—</p><p>Agatha shares that she has a <em>Porsche 911</em> and everything after that is background noise because the only thing the younger woman can think about from that point forward is getting herself in the driver's seat of that car. She’s never been taken to the older woman’s garage before as Christian had always been waiting in the wings to take her to her destination, but this morning Agatha shared she drives herself to work on the account that she can leave whenever she pleases. With that fact now revealed to her, Rio couldn’t get down to the garage fast enough. </p><p>Agatha hadn’t planned on driving them to work together as that was a sure fire way to raise suspicions about the two of them that hadn’t been raised already, but the moment she’d seen Rio's eyes go wide in awe at her perfectly curated collection of vehicles, she’d checked her morals immediately. If Rio needed to be behind the wheel of the Porsche then Agatha needed to see her behind it even more. </p><p>“Do <em> not </em> make me regret this, Rio Vidal,” Agatha had warned as she handed over the keys. </p><p>“I wouldn’t dream of it.”</p><p>And that’s how Agatha ended up next to Rio in her own sports car, white knuckling the handle above her head as the younger woman sped towards Harkness Enterprises. Rio moves the car with precision, like she’d been in this predicament a thousand times prior. Her fingers are wrapped around the clutch and Agatha can’t take her eyes off the way Rio commands it around like second nature. She completely relaxed, one hand flung over the wheel and her bottom lip trapped between her teeth in obvious excitement. </p><p>It shouldn’t be hot. <em> Fuck,</em> it really shouldn’t be, but Rio’s cocky smile as she weaves in and out of the lanes and down shifts on the clutch with ease has Agatha closing her legs together a little tighter. It doesn’t help that the younger woman is sporting Agatha’s button up, sleeves rolled to her elbows and showing off the veins in her forearms every time she grips the wheel tighter. The interior of Agatha’s Porsche is tan and Rio’s all black outfit sticks out like a sore thumb against it and does absolutely nothing to help the ache forming between the older woman’s legs. </p><p>When they arrive at the parking garage, Rio flashes Agatha’s badge to be let in and it takes all of five seconds for the older woman to usher her into a parking spot near the back corner. Of course Rio obliges, her giddy smile beaming the whole way until she safely puts the car in park. She’s in the midst of turning to face Agatha when she hears the unbuckling of a seatbelt before she can even cut the engine. </p><p>“What are you—”</p><p>Rio starts as the rest of the words get caught in her throat at the sight of Agatha’s leg moving towards her over the middle console until it straddles the younger woman’s lap. </p><p>“Shut the <em> fuck </em> up and <em> kiss </em> me,” Agatha demands as she grabs Rio’s face in between both of her hands and pulls them into a searing kiss. Her thighs are on either side of Rio’s and the way they're positioned is making the butt of her heels cut into her ass cheeks while the steering wheel is slicing into her lower back. Though, the way the younger woman’s belt buckle is pressing against her center at just the right pressure is the only thing she notices. She’s wearing a dress today, so there is only one barrier keeping her dripping center from ruining her <em> very </em> expensive shirt Rio’s sporting and it’s not doing a very good job. Her underwear is nearly ruined. </p><p>Rio breaks their kiss with an out of breath laugh and Agatha almost whimpers as her hips are left rocking back and forth, desperate for friction, “Where did this come from?” </p><p>Agatha impatiently tucks her fingers under the hem of her dress and begins to hike it further until she settles around her hips as she says, “I don’t fucking know, but I’m so <em> fucking </em> turned on right now that if you don’t stick your fingers in me, I might do it myself and make you watch.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widen almost comically. Agatha swears they get impossibly darker as the younger woman reaches around Agatha’s backside and grabs a fist full of her now exposed ass thanks to the poor excuse of underwear—a thong—she’s wearing and palms the skin there desperately. A moan leaves the older woman’s throat at the contact, the feeling of Rio’s nails digging into her skin sending waves of pleasure through her as she rocks down onto Rio’s belt buckle once more. The but of the buckle hits against her clit like a perfect fit and it feels so fucking good. She throws her head back in an effort to gasp in more air, but it also exposes Rio to the expansive skin of her neck and she latches onto the skin like a starving vampire.Rio begins to leave hot, open mouthed kisses in the nape of Agatha’s neck though she doesn’t stay in one place for too long. Her tongue is sliding, lips sucking and leaving a slick trail in their wake.</p><p>There’s a low register chuckle against Agatha’s ear as Rio takes her lobe in between her teeth and releases it back with a <em> pop.</em> She can feel the wet kiss of Rio’s lips as she brushes them into her ear, whispering hotly, “And you had second thoughts about me driving your car…”</p><p>Agatha wants to tell her to shut up and find a better use for her smart mouth, but the rebuttal gets lost in her throat when she feels Rio’s hand reach down between them and cup her mound under her underwear. Agatha’s wound up so tightly that she almost loses it on the spot. </p><p>“<em>Damn</em>,” Rio hisses, her index finger dipping through soaked folds. “You’re so wet. <em> Fuck</em>, all this for me?”</p><p>“<em>Yes,</em>” Agatha whispers, her head falling back forward to rest her forehead against Rio’s. The younger woman is working her index finger dangerously slow against her clit, circling the swollen bud almost tauntingly. “<em>Only </em> for you, Rio.”</p><p>And Rio <em> fucking </em> moans. </p><p>“You like that don’t you,” Agatha says as she rocks against Rio’s slow menstrations, coating her fingers even more. And fuck, Agatha doesn’t even really know what she’s saying, but it’s spilling out of her whether she likes it or not. “Knowing <em> you </em> are the only one that can get me this <em> wet</em>?” </p><p>Rio swallows thickly and nods, “Fuck yes.”</p><p>Her eyes latch onto Agatha’s with purpose—like she’s afraid she might miss the smallest movement if she blinks. You wouldn’t know she’s the one with her hand against Agatha’s clit. By the looks of it, the CEO is the one in complete control. Agatha may be the one physically in the palm of Rio’s hand, but the opposite is true metaphorically. </p><p>“Because it’s true baby,” Agatha says as she grinds down onto Rio’s hand just a bit harder, pulling a guttural moan from her throat in the process. “You drive me <em> fucking </em> insane. The way you make me feel—You have no <em> fucking </em> idea.”</p><p>Rio hums in content though she withdraws her fingers from Agatha’s folds to which the older woman immediately disapprovingly sighs at the loss of contact. Before any slick comment from the CEO can fill the space between them, there’s nimble fingers tucking diligently into the waistband of the older woman’s underwear as Rio pants against her lips, “I hope these aren’t expensive.” </p><p>And then she’s tearing them off of the older woman like it’s some sort of sick joke. The whimper that Agatha lets out should be embarrassing but she doesn’t have time to process it because she’s soon whimpering again when Rio’s fingers begin to tease her swollen entrance. It’s blue and brown locked in a trance until Rio’s fingers <em> finally </em>push into the threshold and Agatha’s roll back until they’re hidden behind her eyelids. </p><p>Her hips begin to pump rhythmically up and down onto Rio’s two digits with ease, her arousal leaking down the younger woman’s hand and only making it easier to move her fingers in and out. Agatha bares her hips down onto Rio with purpose, filling herself with everything the younger woman has to offer, but it’s just not enough. She so fucking desperate it’s pathetic.</p><p>“More, I need <em> more</em>, Rio” Agatha cries as she reaches out with her hands to grasp either side of Rio’s shoulders for support. Rio, turned on beyond belief, doesn’t waste a second in adding a third finger and the sound of Agatha’s center taking it willingly draws a moan out of them both. Agatha gasps at the stretch, her stomach tightening at the feeling of being so beautifully filled. “<em>Yes.</em>”</p><p>“You’re so pretty like this… My pretty girl,” Rio coo’s as she begins to to rock her hips up into the back of her wrist, using extra momentum to fill Agatha harder and faster.</p><p>“Say that again,” Agatha moans, her hips starting to move erratically as if she’s beginning to lose control of them completely.</p><p>Rio smirks. “<em>My </em> pretty girl. All <em> mine</em>.”   </p><p>The older woman groans, hands nearly ripping into the fabric of Rio’s shirt as she holds on for dear life. Her legs are trembling—eyes shut so tightly she’s seeing stars. She’s <em> never </em>felt like this before. So powerless, yet so full at the same time. It’s maddening. </p><p>When she opens her eyes, it’s a big mistake. Rio’s eyes are so <em> fucking </em> dark, pupils blown wide as she bites into her bottom lip with near bruising force. Agatha can’t think—can’t speak. Her right hand comes to rest against Rio’s throat, using it as a clutch but also gaining some semblance of her dissipating dignity back. <em> That </em>was also a huge mistake because Rio’s hand comes to rest against hers and pushes Agatha’s hand forward firmly so that it tightens even more around her throat. Rio’s eyes disappear behind her skull and the white hot searing feeling of pleasure breaks through Agatha like a waterfall. </p><p>She sinks down onto Rio’s fingers, clenching around them as she feels her legs begin to give out under her weight. Obscenities spill from her lips, though they're mostly illegible. Without intending to, her hand tightens around Rio’s throat and the sound of a moan ripping from the younger woman’s chest causes Agatha to throw her eyes wide open in concern and witness a sight that nearly makes her come again on the spot. </p><p>Rio’s <em> fucking </em> coming.</p><p>Untouched just from seeing the CEO like this with a firm hand against her throat. And Agatha’s completely spent, but suddenly she could go three more rounds if it meant she could bring Rio to her climax like <em> that </em>again. </p><p>The shock on the younger girl’s face mirrors Agatha’s as they both come down from their highs together. A crimson blush breaks out across Rio’s cheeks and the older woman can see the instant regret pooling behind her eyes because of something she thinks is so inherently embarrassing. And Agatha just can’t have that. </p><p>Rio removes her fingers from inside Agatha center and the string of arousal that follows has the older woman’s mouth watering at the sight alone. In different circumstances, Agatha is pulling those fingers to her lips and licking them clean. </p><p>Rio’s mind is too distracted though.</p><p>“I’m<em> so </em> sorry. I don’t know what just happened,” Rio starts, her tongue poking against the inside of her cheek as she runs a nervous hand through her hair with her free hand. She’s avoiding eye contact like it’s the plague. </p><p>Agatha doesn’t even think ‘appalled’ is even close to the way actually she feels. “That was the single hottest thing I’ve <em> ever </em> seen in my life and you’re <em> sorry</em>?”</p><p>Rio knits her eyebrows together. “You’re serious?”</p><p>“I’ve never been more serious in my life,” Agatha confirms as she rushes forward and crashes her lips into Rio’s like it’s been years since they’ve last seen each other. She’s whining into it, grinding her hips into Rio and trying not to think about how she’s got to leave this car and return to society like a normal <em> fucking </em> human being. </p><p>She breaks the kiss with a dry laugh. “If I ever hear you apologize for that again, I’ll cut out your tongue.”</p><p>Rio laughs. “I think that would be an inconvenience for us both, honey.”</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p align="center">—</p><p>Rio gets to make it to work on time, though, she’s got an uncomfortable wetness sticking to her thighs and has to make a b-line for the bathroom to remove a drying white spot from her lower abdomen—courtesy of her girlfriend. </p><p>Agatha doesn’t share the same fate as she strategically saunters through her elevator doors fifteen minutes later after a makeup touch up and an attempt to clean up the mess between her legs. Thanks to Rio’s removal of her underwear, there was nothing to keep the growing mess in check.</p><p>Despite it all, no one bats an eye. Wanda greets her just as she normally does and Rio falls into conversation with the other interns like she’d been there the entire time. The sigh of relief the older woman lets out is the first time she lets herself admit she’s nervous about this. That fact doesn’t make it any less exhilarating though. </p><p>It only proves to be another thorn in her side. </p><p>The morning passes by mostly in a blur—clouded in the last few follow up calls dealing with her client merger and a resounding few interruptions from a select few employees needing her signature to sign off on new complienes. All in all, much more mundane than her morning had begun. Sometime near the lunch hour, her phone buzzed with a text from Jen with the single word ‘<em>lunch?’ </em>and the rumble of her stomach speaks her answer before her thumbs can. </p><p>She meets Jen at a bodega around the corner from her office. It’s one that sees heavy traffic around this hour, but you get your food within five minutes of your order being placed no matter how long the line out of the door is. It’s Agatha’s go to spot in a pinch. The place is booming and most of the seating is taken, leaving the two women to trek back to Agatha’s office with their sandwiches in hand. It’s not uncommon for Jen to swing by and share a meal with her best friend, but it’d been a while since their last. It seems that the new interns are quite frightened that the CEO has someone that actually likes her in her personal life. </p><p>Agatha pays them no mind as she escorts Jen into her space. They sit at her desk, eating their sandwiches around the heaps of papers strode across the surface. </p><p>Jen’s swallowing down a mouthful of pastrami when she opens her mouth to speak, “So Ralph is <em> gone, </em>gone?” </p><p>“Gone with the wind,” Agatha confirms, a proud smile on her face.</p><p>“And you’ve been cozying up with Rio every day since,” Jen questions with her prying tone. </p><p>Agatha waves her off. “Not everyday.”</p><p>“But last night for sure,” Jen laughs, looking over her shoulder to the raven haired woman standing just behind the glass windows of Agatha’s office. She’d neglected to keep the curtains down this morning which had left them with a view of Rio and another intern chatting next to a vending machine in the hall. “Unless you’ve upped Rio’s salary to designer apparel level, that’s definitely your shirt she’s wearing.” </p><p>Agatha should give Jen more credit. She really leans into the role of private investigator when it comes to the things the older woman definitely tries to hide from her. It should be scary, but it’s somehow comforting because Agatha doesn’t have to find the courage to say anything. Jen will figure it out and do the hard part for her.</p><p>Despite Jen being right on the nose, Agatha doesn’t confirm or attempt to deny her comment. She rolls her eyes, taking a bite of her sandwich and dismissing the comment with a wave of her gold studded wrist.</p><p>“I thought you were being careful,” Jen asks inquisitively. It’s not accusing, but the worry in her tone seeps through and it’s the most sincere the woman has been towards Agatha this entire conversation. </p><p>“I am,” Agatha nods, avoiding the annoyance creeping up in her throat. “No one is going to know that’s my shirt. Just like no one is going to know about us. There’s a few weeks left and then we can lay low for a few more before we do anything that’s irrational.” </p><p>Jen narrows her eyes, “I don’t know about you, but it seems to me that you two are big fans of doing things irrationally.”</p><p>“We’re also two adult professionals,” Agatha adds. “We’re more than capable of keeping things on the down low when necessary.” </p><p>Her mind flashes to the fact that she and Rio had rode to work together this morning, but she keeps that thought to herself. </p><p>“I’m sure you are.”</p><p>Agatha’s sure Jen wants it to come across as cryptically as she said it, but she’s not bothered by that in the slightest. Not when she’s more than self assured with the fact she can and will, keep this under wraps. Not only for the sake of their jobs, but because Rio is hers and hers alone. She doesn’t mind keeping her to herself for just a little longer. </p><p>“You’re serious about her, aren’t you,” Jen asks softly, breaking her train of thought and suddenly the room goes cold. </p><p>“Please, I barely know her,” Agatha retorts but it falls flat in its weight. Deflection is always her defense mechanism and Jen knows it first hand. She’s not going to let this go and the older woman feels like she’s being pushed into a corner. </p><p>“Don’t go all cold on me now,” Jen says. “I see the way you look at her.”</p><p>Agatha scoffs, “This isn’t a rom com, Jennifer.”</p><p>“It doesn’t make it any less true.”</p><p>And Jen is <em> fucking </em> right because Agatha does look at Rio and every single cliche that’s ever existed comes to the forefront of her mind. It’s silly and it’s juvenile and it’s just not something a woman in her forties should be going through, but she is. Rio’s affection devours her whole and then spits her out again and expects her to be a productive member of society when the only thing she really craves is the way the younger woman makes her feel—alive. Agatha had spent forty years just <em> existing </em> until that fateful day Rio made her entrance into her world and everyday since then has felt like a new beginning. </p><p>“I think I’m falling for her, Jen.”</p><p>The admission falls between them and hangs there like forbidden fruit begging to be touched, but both of them are too afraid of what the repercussions would be if they just let themselves submit. Agatha finds she’s entirely too shocked the words slipped from her mouth so easily, but Jen looks like she’d known it the whole time. She just hadn’t expected it to come out without so much as a small fight. </p><p>Though the smirk on Jen’s face is the first thing Agatha had seen before she hid her eyes behind her hands, Jen’s voice is much softer when she speaks, “And that’s okay, Agatha.”</p><p>The older woman doesn’t dare tear her hands away from their spot on her face just yet. She’s too riddle with shame to even move a muscle, but she does mumble against them. “I’m such an idiot, <em> fuck</em>.”</p><p>Jen’s light chuckle isn’t comforting. “Well, we’ve known that, sweetheart. But you’re not an idiot for this.”</p><p>Agatha tears her hands away quite violently this time. Something that feels a lot like the searing red heat of anger starts to sink into her chest and it feels like it’s been caged for so long that she can’t stop it from escaping.</p><p>“Yes I am. I’m not some high schooler giggling in the halls about some stupid crush,” Agatha’s voice is slick with venom, but Jen stays stoic against her chair. The anger isn’t with her best friend, but instead with herself and she’d been so stricken with… <em> love </em> that she hadn’t had time to really let the value of the situation sink in. “I was almost married, Jen. I had a life that I built for myself brick by brick and I let some woman in her twenties come in and blow the foundation down like it was nothing.”</p><p>Tears start to prickle behind her eyes and she suddenly wishes she’d have thought to close those <em> goddamn </em> blinds because she feels entirely too vulnerable to have so many prying eyes on her. Especially the eyes that are supposed to fear her. She can’t lose that too.</p><p>“I feel insane,” she pauses to gather her bearings. “She makes me feel <em> fucking insane</em>. It’s been three months, Jen. This is so stupid.”</p><p>And the way Jen’s eyes look at her with something akin to pity makes her violently ill and when her best friend  leans forward across the desk between them to place a steady hand on Agatha’s shaky one, the older woman almost recoils on the spot. Instead, she fights every fiber of her being and lets herself be consoled by her best friend. It’s new and foreign and she’s never felt so weak, but looking into Jen’s soft brown eyes she feels a comfort envelope her. </p><p>“That’s love, Agatha,” Jen says gently and the sound of it makes her want to burst into hysterical tears. “It can happen in days. It can happen in years, but no one can control it. Not to mention I don’t think you’ve really ever had this feeling before. You’ve spent years hiding behind Ralph because it’s what your mother would’ve wanted, but you and I both know it wasn’t love. Not the kind it should’ve been.”</p><p>
<em>Side note—Fuck Evanora Harkness.</em>
</p><p>When the first tear escapes down her face, she doesn’t wipe it away. </p><p>“You deserve this, Agatha. It doesn’t matter how soon it happened or what others will think because they don’t know you or what it took for you to get here. Let <em> it </em> in.” </p><p>The way her heart swells with pride almost brings a smile to her face because no one has <em> ever </em>held her with so much care in the way that Jen has just broken down every false barrier to their friendship to reassure her. She’s never been one to believe the praises of others, but this one sticks and it starts to mold its way into her chest. Agatha wants to say thank you, but voicing it feels like a battle she’d lose. She just squeezes Jen’s hand and smiles as warmly as she can in the midst of so much emotion. </p><p>“I just don’t want to ruin anything. I’ve always ruined the best things in my life because part of me feels like I deserve it,” Agatha sighs. “What if this is all too fast for her and she leaves?”</p><p>Jen lets out a soft laugh, though there’s no malice to it at all. “Honey, Rio is <em>obsessed</em> with you and that’s putting it lightly.”</p><p>“I still don’t understand that part,” Agatha shares the laugh, tucking a strand of her long hair behind her ear.</p><p>”Oh please,” Jen waves a hand. “You’re sexy and from what I hear, a pretty good lay.”</p><p>“Fuck off.”</p><p>“But you and I both know, no matter how many times you pretend you don’t, that girl isn’t going anywhere. So don’t treat her like she will and you’ll be fine. I promise.”</p><p>Agatha nods softly, but she sneaks in an eye roll that comforts the both of them. “<em>Gee</em> it’s almost like you care about me or something.” </p><p>“Never that.”</p><p>Some time later, Wanda reminds her that there's a meeting for all staff headed by some of her managers as a quick touch base before everyone leaves for the day. They're coming around the final three weeks of everyone’s internship and fast approaching the holiday season, so things are starting to reach their conclusion. The reminder that she'll have to see Rio after the monumental admission she’d had riddles her bones with so much anxiety it’s almost paralyzing. It’s silly. There’s absolutely nothing that has changed. Every emotion. Every tantalizing feeling. It’s all the same as it was. Only now it has a name and Agatha isn’t quite ready to call a spade a spade yet. </p><p>She breathes a small sigh to herself and tucks her new found admission close to her chest for just a little longer.  </p><p>As if they were a pack of sardines, the employees huddle into the conference room and idly stand by as the last few people trickle in. Agatha has never been more thankful that she is only there to supervise and listen as Rio has taken to making sure she remains a constant thorn in Agatha’s resolve. Rio’s sitting across from her in <em> her </em> shirt, with a smirk on her pretty <em> fucking </em> face as she gives Agatha <em> those </em> eyes—the eyes that say, <em> ‘I’ve seen you naked and I’m still picturing it.’ </em></p><p>And <em> fuck </em> if Agatha’s not picturing it as well.</p><p>Okay this makes forgetting about that small little ‘L’ work easy. <em> Love</em>? That’s new. <em> Lust</em>? She’s ready for that game baby. </p><p>Quite honestly, she hasn’t stopped thinking about their morning together since the moment Rio had left her alone in the car. It doesn’t help that she’s completely exposed under her dress and every pass of cold air sends a thrill through her center. She’s been <em> soaked </em> since it happened and the slickness on her thighs is only growing by the minute. It’s tenfold now that <em> those </em>eyes won’t let up. In an effort to keep her resolve, she locks onto Rio’s gaze, welcoming the burn across her body as the younger woman looks right through her.</p><p>Agatha tries not to squirm or visibly tighten her crossed legs together, but even without those obvious tells, Rio just knows. She <em> always </em> knows. </p><p>“Ms. Harkness,” one of her managers' voices cuts through her hot and heavy thoughts. The good thing is, she definitely doesn’t panic. The slight widening of her eyes is just a twitch. Tightening her lips she turns towards her. “The floor is yours.”</p><p>
<em> Why is the floor hers again? Oh…  </em>
</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha swallows against her incredibly dry throat. “Those of you who have asked to stay and work the week of Thanksgiving have been approved. Please be mindful that I will be here as well and do not take lightly to anyone thinking about slacking off. If I’m paying you to work, you will be working.”</p><p>There’s a collection of nods and a few ‘yes ma’am’s’ among the group, but Rio’s eyes burn against the side of her face as if she’d been commanding the CEO’s attention. When Agatha turns her head to look to Rio’s side of the room, she notices the furrowed look of confusion on her face. She imagines the younger woman’s mind is churning as to why she isn’t going home for the holidays, chumming it up with her loved ones. The simple answer is, they’re all dead.</p><p>When the meeting officially wraps up, and the creeping unsettling thoughts about her mother start to slide away, Agatha is the first to exit as she swiftly walks to her office. As quickly as she can, she gathers her things and dismisses her assistant for the day with only one thought in mind—Getting home, taking off this dress and stepping into a much needed hot shower to not only wash off the pooling wetness still coating her thighs but now the heaviness that’s settled on her back.</p><p>When she exits the elevator garage and goes to fetch her keys out of her purse, she’s greeted with the sight of Rio leaning against her car. She’s got her hands buried in her pockets, hair now fitted into a half up-half down bun and Agatha is suddenly dying of thirst and desperate to drink her in. This. <em> This</em>. She could get used to it. </p><p>When she approaches the younger woman, Rio pushes herself from the side of the vehicle and approaches her with her hands already reaching out to pull her into a hug, but she catches herself in the act and stifles them back into her pockets disappointedly. Agatha raises an eyebrow, but she smiles softly in acknowledgment of the sentiment. </p><p>“I’m not here to pressure you into taking me back to your apartment or...” she pauses and blows out a whistle as she overlooks the car next to them. “Give this puppy another go.” </p><p>Agatha knows what she's implying. She’s going to ask for an elaboration on the whole Thanksgiving thing, but to her surprise, Rio doesn’t push the subject in that direction. She knocks it by the wayside completely and opens up with, “My parents are dead.”</p><p>Agatha tries not to laugh at the bluntness, she really does, but she giggles just a bit and relaxes when Rio mimics it. </p><p>“Stop it. I’m trying to be sentimental here,” Rio scolds, rocking back and forth on her heels. “As you know, I was adopted and our relationship got strained when I came out, so I haven’t had a proper holiday in years.”</p><p>Agatha nods softly, gathering an idea of where this is headed, but still choosing to lighten the mood so as to guard herself from falling any more for this woman in front of her. “Are you going to ask me if you can also work on Thanksgiving?”</p><p>Rio scoffs and rolls her eyes. “Shut up, asshole. I’m trying to tell <em> you </em>not to work.”</p><p>“Okay, so you want me to wallow at home by myself—”</p><p>“You’re insufferable Agatha Harkness,” Rio sighs. “Will you spend your Thanksgiving with me?”</p><p>There’s a pregnant pause between them as Rio begins to gnaw on her bottom lip apprehensively. She’s still rocking on her heels, hands shoved firmly in her pockets and Agatha finds this so incredibly cute it’s almost embarrassing.</p><p>“Oh and Matt… <em>Yeah</em>, he’s gonna be there too,” Rio adds quickly, flashing Agatha a full toothed grin. </p><p>Agatha’s eyes widen at the last part. “And Matt?”</p><p>Rio starts to chew on her bottom lip. “Yeah. His parents are also dead.”</p><p>The laugh that echoes through the parking garage fills Agatha’s heart as she can’t imagine what the universe was thinking when it cooked up this scenario for her. How on Earth are things just this perfectly aligned for them? Soulmates are stupidly, but so is the way Rio’s wormed her way into her heart, so maybe they exist after all. </p><p>“Will Matt go running to HR?”</p><p>“If you’re really quiet and don’t make a sound, he’ll never know you’re there,” Rio says as a whisper, but she starts to laugh halfway through the sentence as if she couldn’t hold it in any longer. “I’m kidding. He knows about you. He has since before the internship. Plus it’ll nearly be over by then.” </p><p>Agatha raises a brow. “What do you mean by that?”</p><p>Rio adverts her eyes to her feet that are still nervously rocking back and forth. “I’ve kinda had a thing for you since forever.”</p><p>The older woman gasps in true surprise, “You’re lying.”</p><p>“I wish I was.”</p><p>“Did you manifest me with candles?”</p><p>“Maybe. I’ve always had an affinity for witchcraft.”</p><p>“Of course you have you fucking loser,” Agatha swears and curses any and everyone in the damn parking garage because she’s reaching out to grasp Rio’s face into her hands and pulling them together into a soft kiss without a second thought. Rio goes to jump back as if she’d been shocked, but Agatha only holds her steady, reassuring her every step of the way. The younger woman melts into it, stepping forward and wrapping her arms around Agatha’s waist until she pulls them together with a soft tug. They hold each other close, lips moving slow and sensually and Agatha can’t remember a time they’ve kissed like this prior. She hears Jen’s voice ringing in the back of her head somewhere, but she ignores it for the way Rio is humming into their kiss. </p><p>When they part, Rio’s the first to speak, “Is that a yes?”</p><p>Agatha laughs, “Yes, I’ll spend Thanksgiving with the dead parents club.”</p><p>It comes to no one’s surprise that Rio not only goes home with Agatha, but she’s graced with the keys once more. She’s so overtaken with joy that she takes an extra victory lap in the Porsche with a smile pinned to her lips the entire time.</p><p align="center">—</p><p>As it turns out, having a girlfriend at forty three <em> fucking </em> rocks. It’s been all of two weeks since Agatha had asked Rio on a whim and nearly every single second since then they’ve spent with each other in some capacity. Most of the time it’s naked and tangled together between the sheets—throw in a couple supply closets and Agatha’s office as well. During the off chance they’re not fucking, it’s mostly been dinner dates to Agatha’s favorite restaurants, with a healthy mix of the CEO’s home cooking as well. The older woman has found that having Rio hanging around in her kitchen, stealing bites of different ingredients while she waits impatiently, is by far her favorite out of the bunch.</p><p>It’s the most domestic out of everything and normally she’d be quick to mark sex as her number one—and trust, it’s <em> definitely </em> not far behind, but she hadn’t realized that she’d been missing something as simple as quality time until she started craving the younger women’s presence in every mundane thing she’d done. So while there is <em> plenty </em> of sex taking place, Agatha finds herself trying to slip in those little moments of domesticity that make her heart feel full. </p><p>Admitting to herself she’s in love with Rio has gotten easier, but the courage to actually say it to the younger woman hasn’t quite surfaced yet. Agatha hasn’t gone looking for a reason for either, but the feeling of it always resting in the back of her throat is starting to become a nuisance.</p><p>And Rio? She’d meant it when she said she’d prayed for times like these. Agatha had laughed at first, but it had only taken her a few more occasions to understand just how much this meant to the younger woman—being Agatha’s girlfriend. She’s been utterly devoted to Agatha. In every single sense of the word.</p><p>Rio’s devoted to making sure the older woman knows just how great the meals she cooks are and how appreciative she is of her hard work. How appreciative she is for the use of that beautiful Porsche. She’s devoted to making sure Agatha knows how grateful she is that she flexes that black Amex Card without hesitation to pay for <em> all </em> of their dates—so grateful that her knees are almost always sore from her time spent on them. </p><p>“<em>Fuck, you’re so good to me, baby,” Agatha says as she threads her shaky fingers through the hair on the back of Rio’s head, pulling her closer into her center as her legs pull together around her back. “I’ll give you the fucking world, Rio.” </em></p><p>She’s also devoted to <em> out-bratting </em> herself at every turn. If there’s a moment in time where Rio can slip under Agatha’s skin just enough to where she’s <em> thoroughly </em> reminded of why she should be behaving, she burrows herself in. Though the reminder itself—<em>sex</em>—tends to convey the opposite. </p><p>So compile Agatha courting Rio around and the younger woman devouring her whole in <em> thanks </em> with Rio finding every annoying crevice to work her way into Agatha’s resolve at all the right times, until she’s bent over the nearest surface. All in all, they’re having a <em> great </em> time. </p><p>Things don’t slow down until the week of Thanksgiving approaches and that’s only the cause because Agatha forbids Rio from coming into the office and demands she stay home just like the rest of the interns. She’d actually planned on getting things done in everyone's absence and with the younger woman present, she’d get about five percent complete. </p><p>
<em> “You’re so mean,” Rio had pouted. </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Blow up some creepers on Minecraft or something.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Awh, you remembered their name.” </em>
</p><p>Agatha hates that she misses Rio’s company though. The office feels entirely too empty and while she would normally relish in that feeling, it’s the complete opposite this year. The silence isn’t comforting. It’s a stark reminder that half of her heart is floating around out there and brightening up someone else’s day. It might be a toxic trait of hers, but she’ll diagnose that later. Right now, she can be seething jealous. Even when it’s irrational.</p><p>She shoots Rio off a quick text while she’s thinking about her, <em> don’t have too much fun without me. </em></p><p>It takes a minute for her to get a text back and when she sees it’s a multimedia message, she finds out why. The picture is of her and Matt sprawled out on their couch but she’s wearing a headset and holding a controller up proudly. He’s sitting there fighting a smile as he lays back against the corner of the couch, no doubt putting up with Rio’s onslaught of profanities as she battles some ten year old across the country. Both of them have matching Minecraft pajama pants on and Agatha’s suddenly melting to the floor. The picture is captioned:</p><p>
<em> Wouldn’t dream of it &lt;3 </em>
</p><p>And oh god, she’s in deep—nearly up to her neck in something warm and fuzzy and completely foreign to anything she’s ever felt before. </p><p>Thanksgiving morning, Agatha wakes up excited for this particular day for the first time in years. Ralph’s family was… Ralph’s family and they never knew how to handle her. It was often walking around on egg shells and trying too hard to make her into someone she wasn’t—sentimental and soft. But this year, Rio had informed Agatha she didn’t have to dress up festively at all and she <em> definitely </em>shouldn’t expect a turkey. If anything, keep her expectations somewhere around frozen pizza. </p><p>When Agatha had asked her what she should bring, Rio had let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>
<em> “Thank god you asked. Bring your chardonnay thing. I was going to buy one and surprise you, but I can’t take out a loan until my student debts are paid off.” </em>
</p><p>Agatha laughed and made a mental note to grab a few bottles before her local winery closed. That should’ve been her first clue that the younger woman had something up her sleeve, but she’d let it pass her by without so much as one suspicion. The second instance wasn’t so lucky. Rio had texted her and all but demanded she not show up a second earlier than five o’clock because dinner wouldn’t be ready until then. When Agatha had texted back, <em> how hard is it to cook a frozen pizza? </em>She didn’t receive a response. </p><p>She started to piece together that there was definitely more involved than just throwing a pie in the oven. </p><p>At five thirty, Agatha had gotten her bearings and two bottles of Chablis together and decided to head their way. She’d decided to keep it simple with some loose fitting jeans and, of course, her oxford button up. She’d even left her glasses on knowing it would make Rio happy to see it. </p><p>She’d sent Rio a warning text, but had only received a thumbs up in response. She had to stop herself from sending a strongly worded text about communication and the fact that a simple thumbs up would only send her anxiety into overdrive. There just better be a good reason once she arrives. </p><p>Rio had informed her there was a parking garage attached to their building but it had a hefty price tag to it per hour—she’d stopped herself once she’d realized who she was talking to—so Agatha had chosen to drive herself over on the account of giving Christian time to his family as well. She’d left the Porsche in the garage at home and settled for her Audi as Rio had also advised her that their cars get broken into sometimes. Rio was <em> really </em>selling the place to her. </p><p>However, when she arrived, it was much nicer than expected. Albeit a little more rustic than she was used to, but overall very welcoming. Rio had texted her that she would meet her in the garage so she could walk her up and that’s what led Agatha to where she is now—sitting in her car, hugging the bottles of wine to her chest like her prized possessions. </p><p>Rio is taking her sweet time and it’s only giving Agatha the necessary moment to completely overthink. Thankfully, the younger woman surfaces not much later. She’s quick to reach the driver's side door and open it for Agatha to exit, muttering <em>m’lady </em>as she theatrically bows. </p><p>“Dork,” Agatha laughs as she steps aside for Rio to close the door. </p><p>“May this <em> dork </em> get a greeting kiss?” </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes and leans forward to peck the younger woman on her lips. She tastes like garlic and some form of cheap beer, but she doesn’t linger long enough for Agatha to place it. She’s quick to slip the bottoms from the older woman’s hand and beckons her to follow along to her <em> ‘crib.</em>’ Agatha is happy to oblige. </p><p>Rio’s building doesn’t have an elevator and her apartment is on the seventh floor so after some unexpected cardio, they arrive at apartment <em> 710 </em> and only one of them is desperately out of breath. <em> Hint</em>—it’s not Agatha. </p><p>Rio’s apartment is exactly like and nothing like Agatha had pictured it to be. Firstly, it’s alive with plants and succulents covering most surfaces, casting green hues along the walls from where the sun hits them through their windows. They're definitely not as expansive as the ones in Agatha’s home, but they aren’t the prison windows most apartments in this city have come to have. There are miles and miles of books stacked on dark oak bookcases. She notices they’re reputable titles such as <em> Pride and Prejudice, Don Quixote, </em>and many more along those lines. </p><p>Here and there are little random trinkets. There’s a Minecraft character holding up some pins—a sixth scale figure of spider man dangling his legs off of one of the shelves. There’s various pillows thrown on the couch from chèque to plush stuffed animals. It’s so Rio that Agatha wouldn’t know Matt even lives here with her.</p><p>Speaking of… “Where’s Matt?”</p><p>Rio chuckles as she shuts the door behind them and leads Agatha to the kitchen where something is smelling absolutely heavenly. It’s definitely not frozen pizza. There’s no way anything out of a box could produce this aroma. </p><p>“He’s in here somewhere,” Rio muses as she rounds the corner of her bar that is attached to the wall. It’s their only dining surface besides the coffee table in front of the couch. “I think he’s got a date.”</p><p>“A date? I thought he was spending the day with us,” Agatha asks as she nears the kitchen as well, the spread of food Rio had prepared finally visible and she damn near gasps when she sees that, not only did Rio cook, but she had prepared the same dish Agatha had made them the very first time she had cooked for the younger woman. She turns to look at Rio and the smile that greets her can only be stated as breathtaking. The younger woman is so proud of her work and who is Agatha to deny her any praise.</p><p>“You’re a little schemer,” Agatha points an accusing finger towards Rio and stalks towards her slowly, eyes narrowed. A blush breaks across the younger woman’s cheeks. </p><p>“I wanted to do something special for you,” Rio admits, willingly opening her arms when Agatha steps into her personal bubble. She pulls her close, sinking into her touch. “You’re always doing things for me and I wanted to do more than just give you head.”</p><p>Agatha laughs, “But I like that part too.”</p><p>Rio shakes her head. “I know and there is all the time in the world for that. I am just thankful for you and all that you do for me. The first thing you ever made me was this, so I am returning the favor. Though, I wouldn’t expect the flavor to compare.”</p><p>“That sounds promising,” the older woman comments as she leans forward to nudge her nose against Rio’s, resting against her forehead as well. She lets the scent of Rio envelope her nose and soothe herself into contentment. “Thank you, Rio.”</p><p>The younger woman returns the sentiment, humming along in contentment as well. She moves to capture Rio’s lips into a slow, passionate kiss, and they are only centimeters away when there's a clearing of someone’s throat. Both women turn their heads to see Matt standing in the living room, adorned in a suit with his walking stick hugged to his side. He’s expectant. </p><p>“You couldn’t have given me like ten more minutes,” Rio scolds though she makes no move to release Agatha from her grasp. Agatha looks up to her with knotted eyebrows, but Rio just dismisses her. </p><p>“I could’ve, but then I would’ve missed the opportunity to piss on your moment,” Matt deadpans with a smile. “Oh, and hello Ms. Harkness. Happy Thanksgiving.”</p><p>Agatha nods towards him with a soft smile, but Rio is quick to pipe up for her, “She just smiled and nodded at you.”</p><p>“Oh <em> shit</em>, I’m sorry Matthew,” the older woman chastises herself. The man’s fucking blind. Of course he can’t see her. He probably thinks she’s an asshole now. “Thank you and Happy Thanksgiving to you as well.”</p><p>Matt waves a dismissive hand in her direction. “It’s okay. That’s why I keep Rio around. She’s only good for moments like this.”</p><p>Agatha laughs, “So I’ve been told. I hear she’s a great wingwoman?”</p><p>Matt’s eyebrows raise. “I see you’ve been talking about me?”</p><p>“Shut up. Don’t you have somewhere to be,” Rio throws his way, to which he nods.</p><p>“I do, though, I need you to cut those flowers you promised me,” Matt reminds her. Agatha sees Rio’s eyes immediately brighten as they widen in excitement. A smile breaks out across her face and it’s so inviting that Agatha finds herself mirroring it. “Hence the interruption.”</p><p>“Right,” she exclaims as she losenes her hold around Agatha’s waist and leans forward to place a soft chaste kiss on her cheek. “Be right back.”</p><p>And then she disappears into her room, leaving Matt and Agatha alone long enough for awkward silence to settle in. As if he’d sensed it and would rather avoid it as well, he clears his throat to speak, “She grows flowers in her room. They're lovely.”</p><p>Agatha goes to nod again before she stops herself. She finds that she misses when she could just acknowledge comments like these with a smile or small hand gesture. Now she has to speak and she is so afraid she’s going to say the wrong thing and make herself look even more of an idiot. She settles on something neutral. “I can tell she’s got a knack for it. Your apartment looks like a garden.”</p><p>He laughs and she releases a sigh in relief. “So I’ve been told. I hear it makes the space more inviting.”</p><p>Agatha nods to herself this time, giving the apartment another approving once over as she confirms, “It’s definitely <em> homey </em>in here.”</p><p>“Rio takes pride in taking care of the things she loves,” Matt pauses for a moment and lets those words hang between them—for entirely too long in Agatha’s opinion—before he pipes up again. “And she really loves this apartment.”</p><p>Agatha feels herself take a thick swallow, the room suddenly feels hot because he is going to be a lawyer for christ sake and he’s entirely too good at drilling subliminal messages in. She’d like to go one day without someone reading into her. “A date on Thanksgiving, huh?”</p><p>Matt smiles like he knows she’s deflecting, but ignores it anyways. It’s like he can read Agatha in the same way that Rio can. Though his approach unsettles her much, much more. He’s deliberate with his words—careful around the edges and entirely too calculated where Rio is a loose canon with zero inhibitions. She finds she’d rather be shocked and appalled by Rio’s uncensored vulgarity than share the space alone with Matt’s calculated scrutiny.</p><p>“There’s plenty of women with mommy and daddy issues waiting in the wings.”</p><p>As if she’d been summoned, Rio comes zipping through the door to her room with a bouquet of fresh flowers in her hand, neatly bundled with some twine. She proudly presents it to Matt with a smile. “She’ll love it.”</p><p>“I know she will,” Matt confirms as he reaches out to take it from her grasp. “And I am sure Ms. Harkness will enjoy your meal. It smells amazing.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t speak so soon. She hasn’t tasted it yet.”</p><p>And suddenly Agatha is catapulted back to those same words she had told Rio before the younger woman had tasted her meal. Rio knows what she’s done, her smile toward Agatha says it all and the way those fated words bubble up into Agatha’s mouth catches her off guard and she’s scrambling entirely to stop them from spilling out.</p><p>Rio turns to lead him towards the door and Agatha uses the brief moment to pull herself together. It’s not even close to being enough time. There will never be enough time when it comes to anything that involves Rio. The younger woman shuts it softly behind Matt and in his absence, Agatha feels inherently more calm.</p><p>“He’s very intense,” The CEO comments.</p><p>“That’s just his exterior. He’s soft on the inside. I promise,” Rio just laughs as she approaches Agatha and sweeps her back up into her arms. “Now where were we?”</p><p>And then Rio’s lips are on Agatha’s and it feels warm and calm and like everything Agatha’s ever needed to soothe her soul. The words pull tighter in her chest. She kisses them away by pulling Rio towards her even more fiercely, arms wrapping around her neck to keep her in place. It’s only a few seconds later that the younger woman pulls back, her eyes cloudy and dazed and so full of happiness it’s dizzying for Agatha herself. </p><p>Rio loosens her hold on Agatha to step back and maneuver over to the food she’s prepared to grab and plate and a plastic cup full of wine and the cement bricks that have Agatha’s ankles won’t let her move until she lets this woman know how she really feels. From the moment this woman has entered her life, she’s rewritten all of Agatha’s beliefs and philosophies about fate and soulmates. She’d been sure as true for twenty years that it was just some elaborate ploy to sell romance to those who were desperate for it.</p><p>But here Agatha Harkness is. Standing in an apartment filled with life and personality that belongs to a person that oozes those facets like it’s just sort of who she is. She’s got Minecraft socks and Spider-man Trinkets and books she’s probably only using as decor, but she grows flowers in her room while spreading her vines through Agatha’s heart. Most importantly, she understands without prying too deeply. She’s patient and she’s kind and she never rushed Agatha to rid herself of her previous life. This woman is Agatha Harkness’ soulmate.</p><p>And she <em> fucking </em> loves her. Oh god. </p><p>“I’m falling for you.”</p><p>Rio’s grip on her plastic dinner wear nearly doubles as her eyes go comically wide. Agatha just keeps her smile as she’s never felt so assured in her life. Rio could turn her down right here and it wouldn’t make that fact any more true. </p><p>“You what,” Rio asks with a raspy inflection. </p><p>“I’m falling in love with you, Rio.”</p><p>Rio slowly turns to set down the dinnerware. Her hands are shaking and her skin has turned almost entirely red, but surprisingly her voice is steady when she asks, “Are you sure?” </p><p>“I’m <em> so </em> fucking sure, Rio,” Agatha confirms with a thick wet laugh. “I don’t care if it feels too soon. I was worried about it at first, but when I look at the past three months, the only things that I remember about them involve you. More time isn’t gonna change anything except only make the way I feel for you even stronger. I’ve waited forty years for this—something <em>real</em>. I’m not wasting a second of it lying to myself or you. I am one hundred and ten percent falling head over heels for you… And I want to kick myself in the shin for being a <em>fucking</em> cliche, but I’ll save that for later so I don’t make an even bigger fool out of myself right now.”</p><p>The smile that breaks across Rio’s face could cure cancer if Agatha could trap it in a bottle. </p><p>“You’re falling for<em> </em>me?” </p><p>“I’m falling for everything I know about you and that there’s so much more to learn. I love that I can only grow to love you more from this point on. You’re what I’ve been missing for so long. I just want to cherish every second I get with you by being open and honest. And that starts with being honest about how I feel.”</p><p>Rio pauses for a moment before she starts chewing on her bottom lip in thought. She narrows her eyes towards Agatha, rolling a thought around before she finally says, “We are <em> so </em> getting married one day.”</p><p>If the older woman has to put up with rolling her eyes one more time, they’d most likely end up on the floor by their feet. “Fuck off.”</p><p>They’re both giggling, but Rio makes sure to sneak in one last comment. “Three months in..<em>. </em>And you wanted to paint me as the UHauler here.”</p><p>Agatha goes to slap Rio lightly against her shoulder, but the younger woman is fast on her feet and quickly dodges it. Before the older woman can even recover, Rio is wrapping her hands around Agatha’s waist and hoisting her up off the floor, spinning them around like there’s no one else in the world but them.</p><p>“Put me down,” Agatha screeches through giggles, her body trying—with minimal effort—to escape from Rio’s tight grip. </p><p>Rio does eventually place the older woman back on her own two feet, but she keeps her hands around her waist and pulls Agatha flush into the front of her body. Their noses are brushing and the heat between them is only climbing as Rio tucks a finger underneath Agatha chins and pulls those blue eyes up into her own. “Three days. Three weeks. Three months. Three years. It doesn’t matter. Time is stupid. I’m falling for you too, Agatha. And I don’t want to stop. <em>Ever.</em>”</p><p>The kiss they share afterwards is not different from any other one they’ve shared prior, but it’s one that Agatha is never going to forget. The way Rio’s hands are cupping her face as if she’s precious glass with her thumbs caressing against her cheeks as she slowly moves her lips against Agatha’s is going to be committed to her memory forever. </p><p>They didn’t say <em>the</em> “L” word, but it lies under the surface like lava waiting to erupt. It’s tucked away for a later date, but ultimately, their actions speak louder. Right now, Love is quiet. It’s in the way that Agatha helps Rio get dressed in the morning. In the way that she’s trusting Rio with her six figure car and surrendering every ounce of worry for the sake of seeing Rio smile.</p><p>But in the moments that love is not patient, not kind, it’s thick and heavy—a passion that rumbles through Agatha’s veins and alights every nerve ending inside her brain on fire until every person—everything she’s ever thought about is suddenly compared to this one person. Everything will be measured in Rio-isms for the rest of her life and absolutely nothing will ever compare. </p><p>That of which she is certain. </p><p>So when it comes to love, it’s already settled into its rightful place. Agatha just needs to find the courage to verbally welcome it home.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>When Agatha begins to stir herself awake, the first thing she notices is that her left arm is numb and she’s backed up against a hard surface that is really doing wonders to keep her body cool. As it turns out, anything bigger than a twin bed is a luxury to have space for when it comes to New York City apartments. Rio Vidal and Matthew Murdock do not have such luxuries.</p><p>Rio has a twin bed stuffed against a wall into the corner of her room while the rest of her space is almost entirely taken up by a desk and a standing wardrobe. If Agatha were to stand in the middle of the room and reach both of her arms out, her wingspan would nearly cover the width of the space. She learns very quickly that staying at Rio’s will become a <em> very </em>rare occurrence because two women in a bed this size is not only uncomfortable for her limbs, but the stifling hot body heat that they are producing together is making their exposed skin stick together like glue. </p><p>There <em> was </em>a thin sheet covering them, but one of them must’ve kicked it away during the night and even then, it wasn’t enough to offer any relief from the sweltering temperature.</p><p>Agatha’s not sure what time it currently is, but she will not be sleeping like this any longer. </p><p>With as much strength as she can muster while half of her body can’t feel a damn thing, she pulls her entirely numb left arm from under Rio’s body. She immediately groans at the way her bones crack and her muscles ache, a sure sign of her age. She hasn’t felt like this since college when she absolutely <em> had </em>to sleep in a bed this size. Being close to Rio is lovely and all, but she definitely values the feeling in her arms just a little more.</p><p>Rio doesn’t budge when Agatha repositions herself and slides away from her slot against the wall. Her bare feet hit the cool wooden floor and she sighs in relief as her body carries her towards the kitchen as if she’s on autopilot in search of anything with caffeine to make her grogginess dissipate. When she reaches the kitchen, she finds the coffee maker tucked away next to the fridge. </p><p>She hadn’t noticed yesterday, but their kitchen lacked overhead cabinet space and they had opted to make the most of their counters. </p><p>It’s not the most pleasing thing to see, but it makes locating the coffee grounds as seamless as possible. When her nimble fingers wrap around the half empty bag, she feels her body thrum in anticipation. </p><p>
<em> Fuck, she really needs this. </em>
</p><p>It’s been a long time since she’s had to use grounds and a coffee filter so she spends more time than she would like trying to get the damn thing set up. When she finally starts to get somewhere, she hears a door open behind her and briefly worries she’d been too loud.</p><p>She turns around to find Matt guiding a blonde woman towards the apartment door, his eyes still hidden behind those signature red lenses, while the color of his cheeks nearly rival their hue. The mystery woman looks towards Agatha shyly, her cheeks the same crimson color, before she firmly tucks her chin against her chest. Despite the brief interaction, Agatha thanks god that she doesn’t immediately recognize the woman because running into another intern and having to explain this all <em> before </em>having some caffeine in her system just wouldn’t end well.</p><p>She turns back to her task, leaving them some privacy while she makes the coffee package the most interesting thing in the entire room. Thankfully not even a minute later, she hears the door shut with a deep chuckle following suit. She turns her head to see Matt leaning against the door, a deep grin eating at his face, “Good morning, Ms. Harkness.”</p><p>“Good morning, Mr. Murdock,” Agatha says soundly before quickly beating him to whatever quick comment he was preparing to add. “I take it your holiday went well?”</p><p>Matt laughs again, pushes himself off the door and stalks over to the older woman, “You’re still here so I take it yours did too?”</p><p>She thinks about how stiff her neck feels and how she’ll be paying for the position she slept in for at least a few days, maybe even a week, “Holiday was great. This shoebox you call an apartment… not so much.”</p><p>“Yeah… well, unfortunately our internship isn’t paying so shoebox it is,” He retorts, sliding into the spot across from Agatha and leaning with his back against the counter, arms crossed.</p><p>“Feeling bold this morning Matthew,” Agatha hums, finally taking the pot of stifling hot coffee and pouring it into a mug. She turns around, leans against the opposite counter so that they are facing off and takes a sip of her drink, staring him down over the rim of it. </p><p>He doesn’t press against her comment and it catches her off guard because she’s been hanging out with Rio entirely too much. Any comment like that is open season for bickering to Rio. Matt just seems to smile softly and revel in the silence between them, something Agatha isn’t exactly familiar with nor fond of.</p><p>Agatha watches him as he stands contently, and lets herself wonder what it’s like for him—living. What challenges he faces that she couldn’t possibly even think of. He's standing shirtless across from her, so of course she’d let her eyes peruse his torso, taking in any details on display. The two scars mirroring each other on each side of his chest, near his clavicle, are what catches her attention though. </p><p>They are about two inches long and faded enough that they seem like a distant memory. Almost as if he could feel her staring, he pushes himself off of the counter and shuffles over to her side, reaching out behind her to pour himself some of the coffee. Agatha watches him intently until his voice breaks through her thoughts, “So, she told you how we met?”</p><p>Agatha blinks twice, “Do you have a sixth sense or something?”</p><p>Matt shakes his head, “Yesterday you called Rio my wingwoman, so I kind’ve put two and two together.”</p><p>“So perceptive…” The older woman smiles fondly despite her company not being able to see it. “Yeah, hearing that wasn't surprising, but I <em> was </em> surprised that you’re quite the flirt.”</p><p>Matt laughs, “Well, what I lack in sight I have to make up for with charisma.”</p><p>“Apparently you also lack what the kids are calling a ‘gaydar,’” Agatha comments to the side of his face. He just shakes his head dismissively, not at all impressed. “Her words. Not mine.”</p><p>“In my defense, it is very hard to <em> hear </em>if someone is gay,” he retorts, turning himself back around and retreating back to the counter across from her with a mug nursed between his callused hands. He takes a sip. “Though, it’s not hard for me to hear when people aren’t interested, so I got the hint pretty quickly.”</p><p>“I heard she was rather… <em> colorful </em> in her dismissal of you,” Agatha says. Matt nods in agreement. </p><p>“Rio is one of the most <em> colorful </em> people I’ve ever met,” Matt says softly, his body relaxing as he seems to venture back to a time that Agatha isn’t exactly privy to. Part of her is irrationally jealous that he is the one that got to experience these parts of Rio that she’ll never be able to see, but then she has to climb herself down from that mountain top when she reminds herself that it’s partially because of him that Rio is still here. The other, more sane, part of her feels slightly indebted to him for keeping the woman safe until Agatha had come along.</p><p>“She once told me she was an acquired taste,” Agatha joins Matt in his reminiscing and laughs fondly at the memory of Rio opening up to her. “I knew from the moment she came in for her interview that she was different. She was just… herself. She <em> is </em> so deeply herself.”</p><p>The smile that breaks across his face is genuine and Agath feels her body go warm, “She is. Even when she was at her lowest, she was still like that.”</p><p>Agatha feels something tug deep in her chest—a quick pass of emotion that leaves a sadness hanging in its wake. Thinking of Rio as anything but the happy, charismatic person she is right now doesn’t feel acceptable. It feels like a mistake. “It’s hard to imagine her at that point in her life.”</p><p>“It was even harder to experience it,” he says quietly, his tone distant. He pauses on the memory and lets the weight clear before he seemingly shakes it off and lets a genuine smile tug at his lips. He moves his head up to Agatha's direction. “I’m glad she has you,” he says with such a genuine inflection that Agatha is taken aback yet another time. “I know things are complicated—moral and ethical discrepancies and what not, but I’ve never seen her happier. She thinks the world of you.”</p><p>Agatha’s face heats up and at this point, she would normally feel the need to claw her way out of this entirely too vulnerable conversation—build up her walls so high that it’d be impossible for anyone besides Rio to see these parts of her. But she finds that, like most things that involve Rio, she feels much more comfortable with it. She finds that she wants to let everyone know that Rio is hers and she's absolutely, devastatingly, crazy about her in every sense of the word. </p><p>Before she can think any better of it, she’s smiling to herself as thoughts of the younger woman start to overtake her, “I think the world of her too, you know?”</p><p>Matt seems to brighten at the admission, “I can tell. Your voice changes when you talk about her. It’s… sweet.”</p><p>Agatha wants to roll her eyes. The very thought of being described as <em> “sweet” </em> makes her want to claw her eyes out. However, Matt is quick to add on to his words so she stops herself momentarily from being rash.</p><p>“I just want to thank you… Agatha.” She knits her brows together. “For accepting her as she is. Everyone tries to change her—tell her she’s too blunt. Too weird…” He pauses with a heavy sigh. “I’ve watched her lose herself to her past partners, but since she’s been with you… I feel like I have my best friend back.” </p><p>The admission hits her heavy, waves of sadness seeping into her as she tries to imagine a person that could meet Rio and not immediately love her as she is. How could someone want to change the parts of her that make her smile so widely, laugh so loudly? How could they look into her warm brown eyes and not immediately fall for all that she is entirely? To know Rio is to love her. None of those people in her past carried an honest bone in their body. Agatha suddenly begins to feel an immense hatred towards anyone who dared to make <em> her </em> Rio feel anything but extraordinary. </p><p>The long winded silence settles heavy between them, both of them fighting an internal battle of their own. Agatha wants to say a lot. She <em> could </em>say a lot. Instead, she settles on the only thing that feels right. “You don’t have to thank me for loving her as she is, Matthew. She deserves nothing less. In fact, I’m not so sure she doesn’t deserve more.” Agatha mentally chastises herself for the vulnerable admission and immediately changes course.  “I’m just glad she has you.”</p><p>He seems to understand the unspoken boundary that has just been laid between them. He straightens his back against the counter and offers her an intent, warm smile. “Likewise.”</p><p>There’s a sound of a door clicking just beyond them and the woman of the hour reveals herself to them as she stands in the doorway of her room, hair disheveled, one leg of her sweatpants raised around her knee and her tank top rising above her midsection to reveal her gorgeously toned midsection. Agatha's eyes rest there for a concerning amount of time before they trickle back up to squinted eyes. Rio looks unimpressed.</p><p>“Well look what the cat dragged in,” Matt says with teasing lilt. He never turns towards her, instead still has his body turned towards Agatha as he takes a sip of his coffee. Rio doesn’t verbally answer, she instead properly flicks him off with a firm flash of her middle finger. </p><p>Agatha snorts into her mug, “Good morning sunshine.”</p><p>Rio turns the finger to the older woman, “Both of you can fuck right off. That was the most uncomfortable sleep I’ve ever had in my life.”</p><p>Matt chuckles, “I tried to vouch for a <em> paid </em> internship, but <em> someone’s </em> not budging.”</p><p>Agatha scoffs while Rio’s voice cuts in as she begins to walk towards the two of them, “Is that what you guys have been talking about in here? Work?” </p><p>The younger woman rounds the bar top and saddles up next to her girlfriend who meets her with a warm smile. Rio tucks into her side easily, her head resting into the crook of Agatha’s neck. </p><p>“No,” Agatha affirms with a kiss to the top of her head. “Matthew had a <em> friend </em> over last night.” </p><p>Rio’s eyes widen comically as she mockingly gasps, “No. Not <em> my </em> Matthew. He would <em> never</em>.”</p><p>He <em> tsks </em>his tongue, “Well you ditched me on one of the most family oriented holidays of the year. I’m not to blame.”</p><p>Rio juts out her bottom lip, “<em>Awh</em>, does that mean you think I’m family <em> Matthew </em>,” The younger woman breaks apart from Agatha to step forward and open her arms to Matt. She’s about to close him into a hug when he quickly realizes what’s happening and darts away. </p><p>“Leave me alone,” he exclaims with a laugh, sliding himself along the bar top and towards the hallway in an attempt to escape. “I’m taking a shower. If you follow me, I’m going to drown you in the tub.”</p><p>Rio giggles as she watches him leave, her arms coming back to rest by her sides. “I love you too.”</p><p>And then the door shuts behind him.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t even noticed how hard she’d been smiling at the interaction until Rio stepping back into her space with a chaste kiss wipes it off. The older woman wraps her free hand around the backside of her girlfriend, pulling her closer as they hum into each other. When they part, their foreheads rest together and the sound of the running water in the bathroom is the only thing lingering. </p><p>“You know, I don’t like sharing you, but if I have to I’m glad it’s with him. You two will keep me entertained,” Agatha says softly.</p><p>Rio snickers, “Give it a few more months and you’ll be sick of us like everyone else.” </p><p>Agatha is sure Rio didn’t give as much thought to her answer, but her heart warms when she hears “more months” leave her girlfriend's mouth. Without a single second of hesitation, she lets her mind wander to a life with Rio, Matt fitting into the puzzle—Jen and Alice finding themselves in there somewhere as well and Agatha starts to look forward to the rest of her life and the possibilities waiting for her. </p><p>“I look forward to it.”</p><p>She seals the promise with another kiss. </p><p>When mid December rolls around, the interns have started clearing out their desks and Agatha feels like the end of a chapter is nearing while simultaneously another one opens. The chapter that’s closing feels bittersweet as the spot that Rio once claimed as her desk starts to loss traces of her with every passing day and Agatha finds herself missing the moments when she’d look across the hallway and see her girlfriend absentmindedly reading over something or chewing on the edge of her pen. </p><p>But for some fucked up reason, she’d especially miss sneaking away with Rio and making use of the storage closets, the bathrooms and her own office. </p><p>As if Rio had felt the same, she makes a pointed effort to make a <em> very </em>bold statement on her last day. An effort that would surely allow them to reminisce on just how integral the supply closets had been. </p><p>Agatha’s standing at the receptionist desk, signing a few documents with outstanding urgency, when she hears a clicking of heels nearing her. It’s a steady strut—<em>confident</em>. She hesitates as there’s not one person in this building who should be moving with a confidence that could rival her own. She’s spent years making sure of it. </p><p>Agatha can’t control her look of annoyance when she turns her neck to face the owner of the sound, but when she finally notices who it is, the first emotion that overtakes her is shock. But only a few pounding heartbeats separate the transition to pure, unfiltered <em> want. </em> The urge to touch, to <em> claim </em>is so strong that she nearly breaks the pen she’d been writing with. </p><p>Rio has chosen today to wear her most risqué “<em>business casual” </em> outfit in her wardrobe. It’s an emerald green dress—if you could even call it that. The length barely reaches past the delicious curve of her ass and the neckline is so dangerously low that those two delicate vine tattoos meeting on her chest bone are nearly visible to everyone. The only saving grace is that its sleeves are long. If she was showing any more skin, the older woman might have crumbled on the spot. Agatha’s teeth have never gritted together with such veracity in her entire life. The thought that such undeserving individuals are getting to see the skin that only Agatha should fills her chest with rage. </p><p>It’s moments like these that Agatha’s beliefs start to threaten the very foundation of feminism, because every part of her yearns to make it known that she <em> owns </em>this woman. Every inch of skin these desperate boys are fawning over belongs to her and only her. </p><p>Not to mention, Rio has been mostly all pressed suits since she’d started working at Harkness Enterprises. Meaning, she’d blended in with her coworkers almost seamlessly. So of course, now, she’s standing out like a sore thumb for every single wandering eye to latch onto. Agatha takes a thick swallow and calmly lays the pen down onto the top of the counter. Rio doesn’t look at her directly, but her smirk speaks volumes. Rio knows <em> exactly </em>what she’s doing. </p><p>She doesn’t spare a glance to Agatha as she passes by, her eyes trained ahead as if her finish line is the most important goal in her mind. If anyone between the two of them cares about all the eyes on her, it’s solely Agatha. Rio doesn’t bat an eye at any of the lingering looks being sent her way. The older woman, being one of those sets of eyes, watches her girlfriend's path to her desk in its entirety until she <em> finally </em> takes a seat and so diligently crosses her long legs over one another. It leaves one of her heeled feet dangling as she mindlessly rolls her ankle and Agatha can almost feel herself start to drool. </p><p>Something about how Rio can go from boxers to <em> this </em>is so undeniably sexy. She’s almost angry that Rio would dare to let others see this side of her. A side dripping so much sex appeal that it’s tempting for Agatha to lock her away in her bedroom, for both of their sakes. </p><p>Before she loses her sanity in the middle of her hallway in front of everyone, she begrudgingly takes her eyes away from the sight for sore eyes and starts a slow, diligent walk to her office. </p><p>Agatha has a career— an <em> extremely </em> professional one at that and it’s about time she makes sure Rio understands and respects that. This workplace is her domain—her spot to command. Sure, she’s had her <em> moments </em>with Rio here, but they all were something Agatha had initiated. Rio pushing the boundaries at this present moment… well that just simply won’t do. </p><p>In her head, there’s only two ways Agatha can handle this—because Rio absolutely needs to be handled. </p><p><em> One</em>, she can pretend like this doesn’t bother her in the slightest. That every part of her isn’t dying to bunch that poor excuse for a dress up Rio’s waist and bury her face between the younger woman’s legs until Agatha’s name is the only thing she remembers from screaming it repeatedly. <em> No, no</em>. Those thoughts are <em> definitely </em> not crossing any part of Agatha’s mind. </p><p><em> Two</em>, she can simply give in. </p><p>And that’s something she’d absolutely rather die than let herself surrender to.</p><p>Desperately clawing for the upper hand, Agatha sets her mind to do the first thing she can think of—confront Rio. She ponders all the ways to get her hands on her, but none of them feel safe. There’s too many ears and eyes. Too many chances to have her entire life come crumbling down. </p><p>It’s the last day of the internship. Maybe she can truly just let it go. It’s a dress after all? What kind of possessive creep is she to think her girlfriend can’t wear that? </p><p>But it’s not the dress. It’s the premise of it. Rio wore that dress because she knew the kind of attention she’d garner and that attention is what would set the older woman off. Having men ogle over Rio would make her stomach turn inside out and that’s exactly what the younger woman wants. She wants Agatha to claim her. But she’s not going to ask outright and she’s not going to initiate it because she’s a <em> fucking brat. </em>And Agatha can’t stop herself from falling into the trap no matter how hard she tries because the fact of the matter is:</p><p>Rio will always get what she wants if Agatha has anything to do with it.</p><p>How she gets it, though, that’s up to Agatha’s discretion. </p><p>And a hotheaded woman with a possessive streak and only one non-mean bone in her body is <em> definitely </em>going to make things interesting.</p><p>As the irritation of Rio’s audacity to bring this to work settles in, Agatha starts to brainstorm how she can approach the intern without making a scene. The last thing she wants to do is send her career spiraling down the garbage disposal on their very last day working under the same roof. Ultimately, she decides she’ll just have to do it as inconspicuously as possible. Agatha’s got her phone gripped tightly in her hands before she can think things through any dithering and her thumbs start flying against the screen. </p><p>
<em> Are you out of your mind? </em>
</p><p>—is the message she sends. It’s rash and way too erratic for someone who wants to keep it together, but it’s too late to pull it back now. </p><p>Rio’s response comes almost immediately—like she’d expected it. Agatha’s gritting her teeth even harder now, firstly for being so rash and secondly for being so predictable. </p><p>
<em> what do you mean? </em>
</p><p>Agatha bites back a scoff, her thumbs typing even faster,</p><p>
<em>Don’t play with me Rio. You know exactly what you’re doing. </em>
</p><p>Rio’s indifference is definitely one of Agatha’s biggest annoyances. And Rio knows this. She knows better than to give Agatha exactly what she wants until the only option for the older woman is to <em> take </em>what she wants. And that’s always what Rio is after. It’s only a minute before Rio’s response comes through but it feels like a lifetime as the older woman watches her phone intently, hanging onto every word.</p><p>
<em> hmm not sure i do… enlighten me?  </em>
</p><p>Agatha’s laugh is dry, for only herself to hear.</p><p>
<em> Are you enjoying the attention you're getting? Do you feel accomplished? </em>
</p><p>Agatha feels her cheeks burning as she types it out, each word angering her further as she thinks about what kinds of thoughts are looming around the desperate <em> boys' heads </em>. Thoughts that only Agatha should be thinking. The vibration in her hands snaps her out of it.</p><p>
<em> you’re insane… </em>
</p><p>And <em> oh, </em> when Agatha gets her hands on her<em>…</em></p><p>
<em>I’m insane? You’re fucking insane Rio </em>
</p><p>The next text from Rio is simple as if anything about this situation is. </p><p>
<em> are you jealous agatha? </em>
</p><p>Agatha is a lot of things, but she’s <em> never </em> jealous. Envy isn’t something she finds time to feel. Not when she’s got red bottoms on her heels and a building with her name on it. Jealousy is so far beneath her it’d take years for her to dig and find it. Agatha spends entirely too long thinking about how <em> not </em>jealous she is that Rio seemingly becomes impatient and sends another text.</p><p>
<em> i know it bothers you… other people getting to picture me in ways that only you get to see? </em>
</p><p>The older woman has half the mind to check her face and take a deep breath before she does something stupid like get up and claim Rio in front of all them. Give them a show that they couldn’t dare replicate on their own. And it’s that exact thought that brings her back down to Earth a bit. No one else can do what she does for Rio. No one else even has a fucking chance. She’s smiling to herself as she types it.</p><p>
<em> What's mine is mine.  </em>
</p><p>Again, Rio’s response is instant,</p><p>
<em> i’m not property agatha. you don’t own me.  </em>
</p><p>Agatha laughs dryly, sitting back in her chair as she mirrors the same position as Rio—legs crossed, heels on display. Despite her seething irritation, she begins to feel herself gain some semblance of composure as she types back the only response she could ever muster to a question like that from someone like Rio:</p><p>
<em> Don’t I? </em>
</p><p>Maybe it’s toxic. Maybe it could be the single hottest implication to ever leave her mouth. Whatever it is, Agatha isn’t taking the time to explore it. She means it—in every single way. Rio is hers. </p><p>
<em> are you asking or telling me, Agatha? that feels a lot like a statement. </em>
</p><p>Agatha can picture Rio’s tongue poking against her cheek as she confidently types away at her screen while everyone looks at her with beady heart eyes—only serving to urge her on further. If Agatha was a better woman, she’d let it go. She’d bury herself into her work and forget about this whole thing until a few hours from now when things have settled.</p><p>Agatha is not such a woman. </p><p>
<em> Here’s how this is going to play out. You’re going to strut your irritating ass right into the storage closet at the end of the hall and you’re going to get on your knees and wait for me. I don’t care how many people walk past that door. I don’t care how dirty the floor is. You do not move.  </em>
</p><p>Agatha’s almost proud of herself for how quickly she’s allowed herself to push through her troubled instincts and gain a grip on the situation. <em> Almost. </em></p><p>
<em> and if i don’t? </em>
</p><p>Because of course there’s always one last thing for Rio to say—one last button to press. Despite it being predictable, Agatha falls into it every single time. </p><p>
<em> You will. Because this is what you wanted. And I’m giving you a chance to be grateful before I show you just how unforgiving I can be. </em>
</p><p>Not even ten seconds later, Agatha is snickering to herself as she watches Rio stand from her desk and quickly carry herself down the hall and towards the supply closet. If Agatha were a different person, she would let Rio sit in that closet for an hour before she’d join her there—give her a stark reminder of just who is in charge here. </p><p>Today, though, she’s not that person. </p><p>It’s exactly thirty seconds after Rio passes that Agatha is tracing her steps down the hallway with an extra pep to them and trying her hardest to blend in. She knows Rio can hear her coming and she silently wishes she’d been strong enough to just wait it out a little longer, but the thought of getting her hands up Rio’s dress is too all consuming. </p><p>When her strong hand wraps around the door knob and thrusts it open, she finds Rio on her knees, looking up at her expectantly with dark, clouded eyes. Even when the door shuts behind her and the darkness surrounds them, Agatha can still see the <em> want </em>shining within her dark gaze. </p><p>With a steady hand, Agatha wraps her fingers under Rio’s chin and pulls the woman’s eyeline up into her own. Looking down into Rio as she surrenders herself over to her nearly sends her over the edge on its own. It takes everything to keep her voice steady as she greets the younger woman. “Look at you. You do know how to listen.”</p><p>She can feel Rio swallow against her fingers, her jaw tightening before she opens her mouth to speak. Before she can get any sound out, Agatha raises her thumb and places it against her lips, silencing her. </p><p>“I didn’t tell you to speak,” Agatha says firmly, her thumb dragging down Rio’s lip and releasing it with a <em> pop </em>. The older woman keeps her stoic gaze trained onto the woman below, her eyes giving way to her spiraling mind as she tries to decide on a proper punishment for Rio’s scheme. Despite wanting to dive right in, she practices a restraint she’d only just discovered she’d possessed.</p><p>Rio looks up to her, desire radiating from her that nearly makes Agatha say ‘fuck it’ and devour the woman on the spot. Instead, she takes her hand from Rio’s chin and promptly returns it to her side. The younger woman looks disappointed at the loss of contact, Agatha even swears she hears a whimper. “Desperation isn’t a good look on your darling.” </p><p>The older woman <em> tsk’s </em> her tongue, “What should we do with you?” Agatha lets her mind roam through all the possibilities, the main one that stands out being getting her mark physically on Rio somehow. Whether it be from her mouth or her hands, she hasn’t decided. “You think you can just trepse in here <em> at work </em>and get away with whatever you want?”</p><p>Rio swallows twice, her eyes fluttering into slow blinks as she visibly starts to squirm under Agatha’s dominance. Despite this, a proud smirk stays planted on her lips as Agatha words undoubtedly hit her exactly where she’s wanted. Agatha shakes her head in utter disbelief, but resorts to a knowing chuckle instead. It almost feels sinister when she speaks, “It wasn’t about that though, right?”</p><p>Agatha feels Rio’s jaw tighten in her grasp. “You’re so desperate to be fucked, but you can’t even ask for it. You’re such a <em> brat.</em>”</p><p>The CEO can feel her anger resettling in the pit of her stomach, as she internally makes her decision, “Stand up and turn around.”</p><p>Agatha fights a moan as Rio does exactly as she’s told. </p><p>There’s an industrial sink attached to the wall in front of them and Agatha places her hand on the small of Rio’s back as she goads her to lean across it, her body bending in half. “Put your hands against the sink.”</p><p>Rio reaches out and braces herself against the metal as the older woman tucks her fingers under the hem of her dress and urges it upwards towards the younger woman’s hips where she bunches it. She finds Rio to be wearing a thong, her ass cheeks now completely exposed and the older woman swallows thickly at the sight.</p><p>“Is this what you wanted? To upset me,” Agatha asks, her voice strong but slightly wavering with the thick layer of desire beginning to shine through. </p><p>Rio hesitates to answer and she’s quickly reprimanded with a stinging slap against her left ass cheek. When she unexpectedly groans, Agatha finds herself mirroring the sound before she’s goading her again. “I asked you a question, Rio.”</p><p>Agatha can see that the younger woman is struggling to find her ground, her head clouded with lust and her throat drying out. She clears her throat as she chortles out a quiet, “Yes.”</p><p>The older woman pulls against the dress bunched in her right hand. “Yes, <em> what</em>?”</p><p>“<em>Yes</em>, I wanted to upset you,” Rio confirms and is met with another harsh smack, her body jolting forward into the sink and sending a few bottles of soap tumbling inside of it.  </p><p>Agatha moves to lower her front into the heated backside of Rio, the pressure of her chest meeting against the hard surface sending her skin alight as she whispers near the younger woman’s ear, “And you wanted to be punished for it?”</p><p>Even in the dark, Agatha can see Rio nodding vigorously in agreement. She's white knuckling the sink as she speaks through gritted teeth, “Yes <em> please</em>.”</p><p>“And why should I punish you,” Agatha toys, a sinister chuckle filling the space between their bodies as she leans down even further, her lips nearing the curve of Rio’s ear. “So you can get what you want?”</p><p>“Because I deserve it,” Rio whimpers.</p><p>Agatha finds herself raising her hand to place another sound slap against the now reddened swell of skin. Rio’s whimpers are getting breathy, her legs wobbling as she thrusts her body back to meet Agatha’s movements. She seems to be enjoying this too much for Agatha’s liking, but despite it, she can bring herself to stop. She wants this just as much, if not more. But it’s not enough. </p><p>She needs more. She can’t get Rio writhing and begging for this like she desperately deserves. </p><p>Practicing some more of that newfound restraint, Agatha pulls herself back and steps away from her girlfriend. The loss of contact immediately sends Rio chasing it, her body moving backwards in search of the pressure Agatha had just had on her. When she doesn’t find it, Agatha watches Rio’s head turn on a swivel.</p><p>“Wha—” The younger woman begins, but Agatha is quick to respond. So quick, she even surprises herself. </p><p>“Oh darling, you <em> absolutely </em> deserve it,” Agatha coos, her lip almost jutting out into a pitting pout. “But I’ll decide when and how you’ll get it.”</p><p>If Agatha could picture a look of complete and utter desperation on someone’s face, Rio would be the perfect candidate. The way her eyes are wide with a small gap between her parted lips tells the story on it’s own. The sight brings a smile to Agatha’s lips and only further serves to aid Rio’s desperation. </p><p>“Please Agatha,” Rio nearly whimpers, her body turning to face her boss squarely as she slowly steps forward to close the distance between them. Agatha lets her eyes wander down Rio’s expansive legs before she takes them back up to her pleading browns. “Don't leave me like <em> this.”</em></p><p>Agatha raises her eyebrows, "Are you asking or <em> demanding? </em>For your sake, I hope it’s the latter.”</p><p>Rio takes a thick swallow as she completely closes the distance between them and reaches out to wrap her fingers around the lapel of Agatha’s blazer, her other hand dragging a slow path around the back of Agatha's neck. Her eyes are dangerously squinted in a powerful display of desire, her tongue wetting her lips as she takes her eyes over all the available skin on Agatha’s reddened face. “Please just touch me, Agatha. I want you to touch me. I won’t do it again. I promise.”</p><p>The strong inner breath Agatha lets fill her lungs brings her the first wave of clarity she’s had all morning. Her hands are just itching to claim. Her body thrumming with nerves as she fights every impulse to sink into Rio’s touch. Her eyes are betraying her and have found residence on the indentations from Rio’s teeth puncturing her bottom lip. </p><p>She’s not strong enough. <em> Fuck </em> she’s so weak. And Rio is noticing and with every passing second, she’s gaining a confidence that Agatha is itching to take away. Her inner turmoil isn’t solving anything. It’s nine in the morning and she’s already aware she’s hardly going to get anything done today until she takes care of this <em> issue. </em>She’s halfway to deciding her fate before Rio’s next words put her over the edge. </p><p>“Don’t you want to <em> fuck </em> me, baby?”</p><p>And it’s in that moment that Agatha is reminded she’s worked nearly thirty years to be the boss of her own company and she's been dedicated to this place for every single one of them. She has <em> definitely </em> earned the right to slip away for a few hours. In fact, that’s exactly what she’s going to do because this space isn’t enough. She needs more. More room. More privacy. More time to have Rio writhing beneath her like she so desperately craves. </p><p>Her hands are flying to Rio’s waist, turning them both so that the younger woman is pressed firmly into the door. Her back hits against the hardwood with a loud thump that’s quickly followed with a soft moan, but it’s nearly swallowed when she feels Agatha’s nose press against hers. </p><p>“You’re <em> pathetic</em>,” she nearly spits, a hand coming to rest beside Rio’s head as the older woman leans in. “So needy for me that you’ve got to throw a fit to get what you want.”</p><p>Rio’s smile is wicked, her tongue trapped between her teeth. She’s holding something back, but Agatha doesn’t plore it further. She’s quick to follow up her words.</p><p>“You are going to leave this closet and collect your things.” The older woman sucks in a breath, her hands clawing into Rio’s waist and drawing a gasp. “Then you are going to wait by my car in the parking garage.” Rio’s hips rock against Agatha’s and both women receive a stark reminder of how easily they both fall into each other's traps. “And then I’m going to take you to my apartment and <em> fuck </em>you senseless.”</p><p>The whimper that overtakes Rio is visceral—her body nearly giving out at her knees with Agatha’s death grip on her hips being the only saving grace until the older woman removes her hold and reaches for the door knob. She opens it with a harsh yank, her free hand ushering Rio through the crack. </p><p>When the younger woman disappears, Agatha closes the door back and braces herself against it, her forehead resting against the cool surface as she whispers to no one but herself, “I’m so fucking screwed.”</p><p>She gives herself exactly two minutes in that closet alone, both, to let Rio clear the scene and to also give herself enough time away from the brunette because she’s not sure she can restrain herself any longer. When she leaves the supply closet and finds Rio already gone, she feels a weight leave her chest. It takes her only a moment to retrieve her purse from her office, but it takes her at least five minutes to find the courage to get her feet moving towards the elevator. </p><p>For most of it, she’s thinking of all the ways she can release the tension—all the ways she can have Rio spread out for her. And then she remembers a fateful night just a few weeks ago that involved a bottle of wine and a late night peruse through a <em> certain </em>website that she’d definitely only discovered by accident. She had no intention of ending up there… definitely. The items she’d bought from the site though… they were bought with intention. </p><p>And they were just waiting for her at home in a bottom drawer in her closet. She’d not yet gotten the chance to ask Rio about it, but at this particular moment in time all she can do is imagine using every single one in every single way until Rio’s putty. </p><p>The remembrance has her moving her feet in no time, the dinging of the elevator sounding like music to her ears.  Though, before she exits, she tosses a small smile to Wanda and greets her with a distracted gaze, “I’m going on lunch. I’ll be back in thirty.”</p><p>The look Wanda gives her is quizzical and completely justified because it’s only nine in the morning, but the redhead doesn’t push it further. Agatha assumes she’s left a mess for her assistant to clean up and makes a mental note to right that wrong later. Now, she’s got a better use of her time. </p><p>The trip to the parking garage feels like a lifetime, but the sight of Rio leaning against her car makes the journey feel worth it. She finds herself smiling at the thought of Rio having absolutely no clue what she’s in store for and having a glimpse at the upper hand fills her with a sense of pride.</p><p>She approaches Rio with one hand in her pocket and the other one grasping against the strap of her purse. The younger woman is leaning against the side of the vehicle, her arms crossed and hair billowing against the wind. It takes Agatha’s breath away and for a moment, she forgets she’s supposed to be irritatingly mad. Her moment of silence pushes Rio to speak, mistakenly giving her the idea she’d gained the upper hand. </p><p>
<em> Poor thing.</em>
</p><p>“Has Christian passed over or are you just cosplaying being normal today,” Rio prods as she pushes herself away from the car and steps towards Agatha. </p><p>The older woman chuckles lowly as she sinks her hands further into her pockets—more in restraint than a casual gesture, “You’re on my last nerve today.”</p><p>Rio’s unaffected with her lips curling into a sly smile, “I didn’t know you were so sensitive.”</p><p>The older woman rolls her eyes, her feet moving forward before she can think better of it as she says, “Shut your mouth and get in the car, yeah?”</p><p>The CEO doesn’t exchange another word as she unlocks the car with the fob in her pocket and reaches out to open the passenger door for the younger woman. She purposely avoids looking into Rio’s eyes as the woman slides by her and into the vehicle but she can feel Rio’s smirk regardless. </p><p>When she’s seated in the driver's seat, Rio’s gaze against the side of her face is heated and heavy—clearly daring Agatha to give in which the older woman will have no parts of. Not yet. However, Rio doesn’t practice such patience as she says, “You don’t want to fuck in the garage… for old times sake?”</p><p>Agatha isn’t amused as she throws the car into drive, “Not enough room.”</p><p>Agatha’s not going to touch her here. She’s not going to touch her until she has her in a position where she doesn’t have to stop. </p><p>Agatha’s comment seems to perk Rio’s interest, “<em>Oh yeah? </em> Have you planned something big? Tell me more.”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, a dry chuckle filling the space between them as she grips the steering wheel tighter, “Why don’t you practice some patience <em> hm?</em>”</p><p>The CEO isn’t looking at Rio, but she can hear shuffling next to her as the younger woman unbuckles her seatbelt. Agatha is immediately intrigued, her brows knitting together as she watches Rio as intently as she can without killing them both. Though she instantly regrets it when she gets a sight of Rio. The younger woman lets a smirk paint her cherry red lips before trapping the bottom one between her teeth. Agatha’s eyes focus there for longer than she should and thoughts of replacing Rio’s teeth with her own makes her jittery.</p><p>Agatha has half the mind to turn back to the road and blink away those thoughts, but it’s no use. Not when she somehow found herself with the walking sin that is Rio Vidal. Not only is the younger woman turned towards her, that sultry look in her eye that makes Agatha want to fall to her knees, but Rio’s spreading her legs apart, “What if I don’t want to be good, Agatha?”</p><p>It’s a warning and it’s received loud and clear as it sets off all the alarm bells inside of Agatha’s sense of self. Rio immediately sees the challenge and keeps her voice breathy and warm like a siren calling a sailor home as she moves her hand to the growing wet spot between her legs. Agatha licks her lips as she turns her head to the side for a split moment to take in the sight. </p><p>It’s a mistake. <em> Oh boy</em>, is it a mistake. </p><p>“When I get my hands on you, you won’t be able to walk for the next week if you don’t stop it right now,” Agatha commands, her voice strong, but Rio only moans in response as she pulls her poor excuse for underwear to the side with her index finger. </p><p>“<em>God, </em> I hope so,” Rio cries as she dips two fingers into the pool of wetness in between her folds and runs her fingers diligently through them. The sound is sticky and wet, pulling a deep moan from her chest as she throws her head back against the seat. “<em>Fuck</em>, Agatha. I can’t wait for you to touch me.”</p><p>And Agatha wants to take everything back and tell Rio she’s not going to touch her—that she’s forced to sit in her current state and wish she’d behaved. But Agatha’s not strong enough to deny either of them of the fucking that’s about to take place when she pulls into her own parking garage just a few seconds down the way. </p><p>Her mouth feels dry, throat tight as she swallows down any and all verbal responses to Rio’s cries. The younger woman doesn’t seem to mind the lack of attention though as she knows she’s got it regardless. Her fingers still work against herself as her chest rises and falls in breathy movements and it takes everything inside Agatha to not pull over the side of the car and replace Rio’s fingers with her own. Especially when Rio’s filthy mouth doesn’t stop running. </p><p>“I want you so badly,” Rio says in a tight whisper, winded breaths escaping her lungs. Agatha swears the car gets hotter, the air between them muggy and thick as she finally turns onto her street. “<em>Fuck</em>, I want you to ruin me.”</p><p>Rio’s onslaught of verbal praises continues even as she parks the car and all but rips her door open. The first thought that crosses Agatha’s mind as she rounds her car and goes to open the passenger door is that she’s going to fall to her knees and devour Rio until she’s shaking around her head. Until she’s pushing Agatha away and crying out and even then, the older woman isn’t going to stop. Rio wanted this. She’s going to get <em> all </em>of this.</p><p>Instead, she imagines her neighbor, Sharon, catching them in said act and then proceeding to knock down her door with a priest every day thereafter. So with her tongue nearly tearing in half from the pressure of her teeth, she rips open the door and reveals her now put together girlfriend and the only thing Agatha can say is, “Out.”</p><p>Rio exits the vehicle with a cordial bow in mockery and Agatha just <em> knows </em> that the younger woman is internally giggling and kicking her feet like she’s not about to be absolutely <em> ruined </em> and forced to return to her desk like nothing of the sort had happened. With the way Agatha slams her door shut, it echoes through the entire level and makes Rio chuckle to herself but it quickly gets knocked back into her lungs as Agatha grabs her by the elbow and roughly tugs her along. </p><p>Rio keeps in step with Agatha’s ever growing strides towards the elevator and she surprisingly doesn’t have anything to add. The older woman wonders if she <em> finally </em>has begun to understand she doesn’t have to continue pressing every single button. She’s going to get what she wants. </p><p>Agatha enters the elevator first, pulling Rio behind until she promptly tugs her around and pushes her up against the backside of the elevator. Rio gasps in surprise, her hands flying to Agatha’s shoulders to brace herself as their bodies collide. She doesn’t move them away immediately In fact, she only grips on tighter when she sees the look in Agatha’s dark eyes. </p><p>Agatha finds that her first notion is to step back and pull herself together, but instead she falls into the intoxicating close proximity between the two of them, an undeniable pull settling in her stomach. She keeps her left hand firmly on Rio’s elbow while her right tucks into her pocket in order to keep herself from doing something stupid like giving the security camera and good show. </p><p>The moment of hesitation has Rio taking the reins. She looks at the older woman for a few frozen moments before she lets her fingers slide along the inner lapels of Agatha’s blazer, her eyes holding Agatha’s intensely as she waits for the tell tale sign of permission granted to take what she wants. The CEO isn’t keen on giving that up and sets her jaw firmly, her eyes narrowing. </p><p>Rio’s unbothered with her intentful fingers now traveling down Agatha’s perfectly creaseless sleeve, before eventually grazing over the exposed skin between the end of the cuff and where her pants pocket hides the rest. She lets the pad of her fingertips rest there, pressing into the skin softly before she drags her nails around the width of Agatha’s wrist and grabs it firmly. She pulls it out from the pocket in one fellow swoop and looks down at the hand that’s holding Agatha’s like it’s a prized possession, a battle won in the war she’s raging. Agatha feels her breath hitch, her body denying her of any tension as the younger woman then slides their hands around her waist before pushing it further down her silk dress until she’s cupping, hiding Agatha’s hand to cup her right ass cheek.</p><p>“There,” Rio says proudly, her breath low as she leans forward, lips ghosting over the older woman’s. “Step one is finished. Are you going to put your pride aside or am I going to have to do everything for you?”</p><p>The cord in Agatha snaps as she pulls Rio even closer to her body by the now firm grip on her backside. </p><p>“You’re going to regret that,” Agatha growls, her eyes flicking to Rio’s lips before settling back into her eyes. Saved by the ding of the elevator signaling they have arrived to their floor, Agatha pulls herself from Rio and steps aside to motion for Rio to lead the way. The raven haired girl looks at her inquisitively before finding her footing and strides towards the apartment.</p><p>Agatha saunters behind slowly, her fingers thumbing the brass buttons on the cuffs of her blazer as she loosens them. She drags the jacket off with it sliding off her shoulders like water as she rids herself off it completely, dangling it over her right shoulder with one curled finger acting like a hook. If Rio were to look back at her at this very moment she’d find a sight that would surely send goosebumps down her spine.</p><p>When they reach her apartment door however, Rio turns to look at her as she unlocks the door and Agatha sees her eyes widen ever so slightly. With tousled, thick hair falling over her shoulders, white button up tucked into her black chino trousers, blazer dangling and lips curled into a smirk, she knows she looks as powerful as she feels. </p><p>They walk through the apartment door, the blazer falling to the floor as Agatha locks her narrowed eyes at Rio, “You know the way.” She says as she then begins to fiddle with the buttons on the cuffs of her sleeves, loosening these cuffs as well. Rio walks towards the bedroom, but she does so with her front turned towards Agatha, her eyes watching every single movement like a lifeline. The older woman chuckles as she notices and then starts to roll the sleeves of her shirt up to her elbows, her veins flexing in her forearms as she does so. </p><p>Rio swallows thickly, her stride stuttering ever so slightly as she pulls her bottom lip between her teeth in obvious anticipation. </p><p>Agatha doesn’t let up either, her hands turning to the buttons against her throat and undoing the first three, stretching her neck as the tension around her collar releases and nearly reveals the swell of her breasts inside her lacy bra.</p><p>“<em>Dear god,” </em>She hears Rio whisper as her back finally juts up against the bedroom door, her stride stopping but not Agatha’s. The older woman steps into her personal space, a finger coming up to tuck under her chin.</p><p>“Oh darling,” Agatha cooes as she darts between both of Rio’s darken eyes. She then leans forward and Rio can’t help but flutter her eyes shut as Agatha ghosts their lips together. “Don't bring <em> him </em>into this,” She commands as her hand wraps around the door knob just to the left of Rio’s hip and promptly twists it open, sending Rio stumbling into the room, but Agatha is quick to grab her by her waist, pulling their bodies tightly together once more. </p><p>Their lips finally connect in a charged and desperate kiss that weakens Agatha at the knees. Rio’s grabbing into her hair so tightly, she swears it’s ripping from her scalp, but it feels so fucking good that she’s open mouthed moaning into Rio and the younger woman is swallowing every single one eagerly. Agatha’s hands are definitely brushing Rio’s hips, but the connection isn’t enough. She needs so much more. She’s tearing at the hem of Rio’s sickeningly short dress before she can think twice and pulling it up to bunch around Rio’s hips. </p><p>With the now available range of motion, Rio raises her leg to wrap around Agatha’s waist hungrily, her body desperately trying to consume Agatha’s like there is too much room between them despite their barely being an inch. The older woman doesn’t seem to mind as she reaches around and cups a handful of Rio’s plentiful ass, getting an immediate moan in response. </p><p>Agatha has to pull away and remind herself of her mission, of her entire reasoning for moving this here. Rio looks surprised at their patrimony, but Agatha’s voice is quick to clear up any concerns, “Strip.”</p><p>Rio’s frozen in place for half a moment before she’s frantically clawing at the straps of her dress to get them down her shoulders in record time. Agatha steps aside and carries herself to her wardrobe where the item she’s been fantasizing about this entire time lies hidden away, just beckoning her name. When she has the item grasped in her hand, she feels a sickening sense of confidence wash over her and suddenly she can’t wait to get back in that room to Rio. </p><p>She’s two steps away from the door when she gets the first glimpse of Rio standing there, completely nude and as gorgeous as ever. Even with everything that’s happened, Agatha still feels her chest clench at the sight. She doesn’t have long to revel in it as Rio’s eyes drop to the item Agatha’s toting along. </p><p>The older woman chuckles to herself, “It's a spreader bar.” A flash of recognition washes over Rio’s inquisitive gaze and Agatha swears she sees a small smile. “Now lay back on the bed.”</p><p>Rio does so eagerly, nearly jumping back and flopping onto the bed like a starfish. Agatha wants to laugh fondly, but she hides it well as she brings their new toy up in front of her and commands all of Rio’s attention. It’s exactly what it sounds like: a bar that spreads or extends out. On either side of the bar are two cuffs that fasten around your partner's ankles to hold them open. </p><p>Rio watches Agatha with great intention as she fastens the cuffs around her ankles. The older woman takes her time, dragging her fingernails across her raised skin and making a pointed effort to shift things around. When she has Rio right where she wants her, she steps back to admire her work and the sight is more than she could’ve ever imagined. The bar has Rio’s legs slightly open, just enough that her swollen and pink center is staring at Agatha and all but begging for her arrival. She finds herself licking her lips in anticipation as she moves her fingers to her belt for her next move. </p><p>“You sure are taking your sweet time,” Rio says, her voice wavering with impatience and putting the amount of desperation she’s feeling on complete display. Despite it, she can’t seem to wipe the look of awe off her face as she watches the CEO’s every intentful move.</p><p>As Agatha undoes her belt buckle and snaps the leather from around her waist in one yank, Rio releases a noise from her throat and feels her body jerk in anticipation.. Agatha moves towards the bed and drops a knee between Rio’s legs, the other on the outside of her left leg and straddles there with the belt dangling across Rio’s chest. </p><p>The older woman looks at her sharply, “And I’ll take longer if you don’t be quiet.”</p><p>Agatha then reaches out and pulls Rio’s left wrist from where they are thrown out to her sides and then quickly follows suit with the right one until they are pinned together in front of Rio’s face. Agatha makes a quick work of securing them together with her belt, Rio’s dark eyes lingering in the background of her focus. Agatha catches them when she finally releases Rio’s hands and the younger woman pleads almost immediately, “<em>Please</em>.”</p><p>The older woman decides then that perhaps she can give a few inches and crawls off of Rio to give herself some space to remove her pants. Rio, again, watches as she does so, but is quick to add a comment that knocks Agatha off guard, “Can you keep on the shirt?”</p><p>Agatha looks down to her body and sees herself the way Rio sees her for the first time and she honestly gets it. The way the button up hugs her and borderline serves as a reminder of the position Agatha holds would be a turn on for herself too if the roles were reversed. </p><p>Obliging, Agatha offer’s Rio a tight smile before moving over to her nightstand and retrieving their strap and harness from its rightful place. Putting it on is muscle memory and only takes a few seconds, but one would think it’s a lifetime by the way Rio is thrashing against her new restraints. </p><p>As Agatha approaches Rio with her dildo fastened between her legs, she notices the younger woman try to pry her legs open wider, but the bar refraining her from doing so, “So eager…”</p><p>Rio whimpers, “I can’t help it.”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, “You asked for this, if I recall.” She starts to retrace her previous steps to straddle Rio’s lower legs but she’s unbuttoning her shirt during the process, throwing it open to reveal, “Or is this more than you bargained for?”</p><p>She watches Rio fight within herself not to say something to hem her up even further, but ultimately she ends up saying, “No, I want this. <em> Please.” </em></p><p>“Well, you've been asking so nicely,” Agatha says softly as she leans forward and grabs a hold of the spreader bar before pulling it up from the bed along with Rio’s ankles. “It’s only right that we don’t keep you waiting any longer.” And with that she swiftly extends the bar between Rio’s ankles and pushes her legs out wider, completely opening her center up.</p><p>Rio yelps, but it’s quickly swallowed as Agatha’s next move is to flip the bar completely over and send Rio turning to her stomach, her elbows tucked beneath her chest. </p><p>“<em>There</em>,” Agatha says proudly as she crawls up behind Rio’s, straddling her calves as she reaches out and grabs hold of Rio’s hips, pulling them up from the mattress and up into the air so her entrance is leveled with the tip of Agatha’s strap. With a slow, diligent finger Agatha drags a path up the younger woman’s back, tracing the tattoo before settling near the nape of her neck and sliding her hair to the side. </p><p>She can feel Rio shutter beneath her, her body involuntarily rocking back into Agatha, but the older woman is already halfway to using it to her advantage. She lets Rio slide onto her length, the sound of her slick, wet heat enveloping it fully sending both of them into a frenzy as Agatha takes her hand near the back of Rio’s head and reaches it around the front of her throat, pulling the younger girl back onto her knees as she thrusts up into her. </p><p>“<em>Oh</em>,” Rio says as the feeling of Agatha’s entrance takes over—the slow, deliberate pull back of Agatha’s hips then making her instantly crave more. “<em>Faster</em>.”</p><p>As if she’d already had it in mind, the older woman pushes herself up into Rio with a purpose this time, their skin slapping together as it meets and the sound hitting Agatha exactly where she needs it. It’s rough from then on. The tender care and love between that they’ve normally moved with is replaced with something different—something each of them are settling into with ease. The way Rio’s groaning against Agatha’s hand pressed into her neck is enough to push Agatha on, not that she needed any motivation. Sinking into Rio like this after drawing it out for so long feels like heaven. </p><p>“That’s it,” Agatha says as she thrusts in harder, her thighs clapping against the back of Rio’s legs causing a stinging jolt of pleasure. “Take it.”</p><p>“<em>Yes</em>,” Rio cries, the moans toppling out of her as a sure sign of her frustration <em> finally </em> being released.</p><p>“Tell me how good I feel,” Agatha demands as she pulls out her full length, Rio’s legs shaking around her as the withdrawal sends her into overdrive. “Tell me and I <em> might </em> continue.” </p><p>“You feel<em> so fucking </em> good. Just—<em>Please </em>don’t stop,” Rio cries as she tries to push herself back down onto Agatha, but she’s met halfway with another striking thrust from the older woman as the hand around her throat releases its hold in the process, sending her toppling down into the mattress with her face pressed into the sheets. </p><p>Truth is, Agatha wouldn’t dream of stopping, but she does so anyways. </p><p>She pulls herself out of Rio and is immediately greeted with a disapproving groan as a cry of “<em>No”</em> leaves from the younger woman. </p><p>“Do you deserve it, Rio,” Agatha asks coyly, her voice rough around the edges as her eyes connect with the younger woman’s over her shoulder. “After the way you behaved…”</p><p>There are desperate tears in her eyes as she answers, “I do. I really fucking do. I’ve been <em> so </em> good. I can be good.”</p><p>Agatha isn’t at all convinced, well, at least that’s what she wants Rio to think. The younger woman is whining with impatience, pupils blown to high heavens and hair tousled around her face and spread across the sheets. It’s the most desperate she’s ever seen her. This brings a smile to Agatha, but she still shakes her head disapprovingly, “You drive me insane.”</p><p>Agatha positions her length towards Rio’s entrance and pushes the head in effortlessly, the rest of the length following suit. Rio groans, the tension leaving her body as Agatha grasps at her hips, sinking her nails into the available skin and using the leverage to pull Rio into her thrust. </p><p>“Oh <em> fuck</em>,” Rio cries though it mostly gets swallowed by the mattress. Agatha pushes in harder, faster, her body moving to a rhythm she’d not known she was capable of until this very moment. Rio takes it all readily, even hungrier after each thrust. </p><p>“This what you wanted,” Agatha says through breathless grunts, not even truly aware of what’s coming out of her mouth as she drives to a destination not even she’s sure she can handle. Her center is pressing against the butt of the dildo and it’s hitting her square on her clit with every thrust, but it’s not enough. It only serves as a constant push to keep going until she reaches her goal. </p><p>The goal being, make this as long and drawn out for Rio as possible. So when she pulls out again, Rio nearly folds under her grasp, “Oh come on.”</p><p>But she, once again, quickly eats her words as Agatha grabs hold of the bar between her ankles and tugs it over again, flipping Rio onto her back. The younger woman looks like she’s about to say something smart, but The CEO is quick to lift the bar from the bed and crawl underneath it until it hits the small of her back. Rio’s legs are now situated against Agatha’s hips as the older woman settles back down into Rio’s wet heat as if no interruption had taken place. </p><p>The way that Rio’s eyes promptly roll to the back of her head at the new position allowing for a deep reach makes Agatha’s mouth go dry. She’s got her hands on either side of Rio’s head, her face hovering just inches away. Rio’s wrists, still tied together, fall back and rest over her head. As Agatha rocks into her, she braces her hands against the headboard until the older woman reaches up and takes hold of the belt linking them together and pushes her weight against them, using Rio’s wrists as a clutch. </p><p>Agatha looks down at her work and lets a smile grace her lips. It’s almost mocking Rio and her pathetic descent into this writhing mess, but her words are the icing on the cake, “Let me see those eyes, pretty girl.”</p><p>The speed at which those deep browns lock onto Agatha’s blues is record breaking. She tries her hardest to keep them trained ahead as her body continues to rock, the power of Agatha’s thrusts only increasing. And then <em> finally, </em>Agatha reaches between them with her left hand and starts to work against Rio’s incredibly swollen clit. At first contact, Rio cries out, her body jolting forward in immense pleasure. </p><p>“That feel good,” Agatha goads, her thrusts becoming more erratic, voice rough around the edges. </p><p>“<em>Uh huh,</em>” Rio answers, but Agatha’s already jutting in.</p><p>“Use your words sweetheart.”</p><p>Rio groans, the strength to pull together a coherent string of words clearly becoming more challenging by the second. But without fail, because she’d never let Agatha down, she’s able to grunt out, “Feels amazing.” </p><p>Her eyes are so glossy, completely void of any strength as Agatha coaxes her closer and closer to her much anticipated finish line, “<em>Yeah? </em>Are you gonna come for me?”</p><p>“<em>Yes</em>,” It’s a quick answer. An answer Rio’s never been more sure of in her life as she cries out, back lifting from the bed. Her wrists thrash against Agatha’s hold, body shaking as the older woman doesn’t let up on her thrusts or her ministrations against her clit. “Agatha, <em> fuck.</em>”</p><p>It’s taking half of Agatha’s strength to hold her girlfriend in place, but despite it, she keeps her movements strong. Rio pants against her, eyes hidden behind her lids as she meets each of Agatha’s thrusts despite the overstimulation getting the best of her.</p><p>“Agatha. I can’t. I can’t—”</p><p>“Yes you can,” Agatha commands as she keeps her pace. She feels Rio’s legs tightening around her waist, an attempt to close her off, but the bar keeps them in place. </p><p>And Rio lets out one final cry as her body thrusts into a powerful orgasm, the waves of intense aftershocks sending her body shaking as she unknowingly soaks Agatha’s lower half with her climax. The older woman watches in awe as the pleasure overtakes her in droves. Mouth agape and neck strained as she tries to find some semblance of a tether back to herself, but it takes a few more seconds before she even gets a glimpse at one.</p><p>When she comes to, Agatha can’t help but reach out and tuck a loose strand of hair behind her lover's ear as she looks onto her with a soft smile. Rio blinks a few times, swallows a few more and the only thing she can think to say is, “Holy shit.” </p><p>Agatha laughs, raising her girlfriend’s legs so that she can slip underneath the bar that is still exposing Rio’s dripping center. She unfastens it slowly, giving time for Rio to slow her rapidly rising chest. By the time she’s discarded the bar to the side, Rio’s looking at her with a drunken smile, eyes shining brightly.</p><p>“Satisfied,” Agatha questions with a teasing lilt as she crawls up next to Rio, laying next to her on her side.</p><p>“Yup,” Rio says and then follows it up with a giggle. “I can’t feel my fucking legs and I think the hearing is gone in my left ear.”</p><p>“Good,” Agatha laughs. “Remember this next time you try something stupid.”</p><p>“It was a nice dress,” the younger woman exclaims, looking onto Agatha in exasperation.</p><p>The older woman rolls her eyes, “Sure. That’s <em> definitely </em>the only reason you wore it to work today.”</p><p>“It was,” Rio tries again, but the smile on her lips tells Agatha not even she believes it. The air between them turns soft—that fondness settling back between them as if it never left. </p><p>There’s a lot Agatha wants to say as she stares into her girlfriend like she’s holding the answers to every mystery on this Earth, but the only thing that comes out is, “Okie dokie, back to work!” And then she’s rolling herself out of her bed and disappearing into her closet where she will be repairing her outfit and finding a solution for Rio’s.</p><p>They end up back at work, Agatha moving with a new suit and a confident pep in her step as Rio trots in behind her on wobbly legs, a much more modest pant suit on. When she finally makes it to her desk, Matt is seated directly next to her with a knowing smirk on his face. He snickers towards her, but Rio’s quick to cut him off.</p><p>“Shut it.”</p><p align="center">—</p><p>In the moments that Agatha finds herself alone, the quiet starts to whisper doubts into her ear. Doubts about how, now that they don’t <em> have </em> to see each other daily, Rio won’t have a reason to come around anymore. She’ll stay away and find someone else, someone <em> her </em>age, and there won’t be a need for Agatha anymore. She won’t want Agatha anymore. </p><p>But then Rio squashes all of that noise by simply just existing and being Rio Vidal. Sometimes Agatha will be hard at work in her office, rubbing the knots out of her neck and desperately trying to string a coherent conversation together when Rio facetimes her to do absolutely nothing besides pose with a duck face like she’s taking a 2000’s selfie just because she’s bored. She’ll make sure to send Agatha pictures of her Minecraft builds for approval or a quick photo of her holding up a new flavor of an energy drink she’s found. She’ll call Agatha to have her listen to rehearsals of her presentations that are already perfected and the older woman learns that these are Rio’s ways of saying ‘I miss you.’</p><p>And it makes her wonder how she could ever think this woman would leave her. </p><p>These parts of Rio become Agatha’s favorite parts and after a while, they start to become parts of herself. She finds herself sending selfies at her desk—in her glasses of course—just because she knows Rio will panic and her text chain of expletives and random strung together letters always brings a smile to her face. She’ll call Rio just to sit on the opposite side of the phone while they work just so she can hear the random outbursts and quiet concentrated whispers from the other side of the line. </p><p>But her favorite adjustment is when they are together, Rio has an obvious need to be touching Agatha in some capacity. It’s not invasive or overbearing. It’s gentle in the way she’ll throw her feet over Agatha’s lap while they sit on the couch reading or how she’ll sit on the kitchen counter while Agatha is cooking and she’ll quietly remind her girlfriend of her presence with a poking kick of her foot. She’ll play footsie under the table and she’ll throw her ankle over Agatha’s under the comforter when it’s too hot to fully cuddle in bed.</p><p>Rio’s love isn’t loud or chaotic like every other part of her. It’s gentle, quiet, and considerate but still <em> Rio </em> and that’s what makes Agatha fall for her even harder. </p><p>Loving someone so fast can be scary, but loving someone like Rio is as easy as breathing. </p><p>So when Christmas rolls around and they find themselves free from their work just long enough to squeeze in some holiday cheer, there isn’t a question this time—they spend it together. </p><p>Agatha wakes up on Christmas morning to an empty bed and the sound of George Michael's ‘<em>Last Christmas</em>’ echoing softly through her bedroom door. When she throws on her robe and pads through the hallway, she finds a soft, warm toned glow emitting from her living room as she nears the end. Among the music, there is the soft clatter of what could only be Rio messing with something in the kitchen. She finds a fire lit in her fireplace with their stockings hung just above them, items nearly busting out of the seams. Agatha smiles as she remembers them hanging them up together just a few hours prior. </p><p>She’d never been much into the holiday spirit, so her holiday decorations were few and far between, but it had only taken a moment for Rio to convince her that they needed to make a store trip to rectify that.</p><p>So now, in addition to the stockings, there’s a new found four foot tree—it was the only size on the shelf at such late notice— stuffed away in the corner of her apartment, just by the windows and it’s got twinkling lights haphazardly thrown in between the branches and a can of fake snow sprayed into it. There’s mistletoe dangling under all her door frames and obnoxiously big candle sticks place on all of her shelves along with little trinkets of elves and reindeer. But best of all, there's the smell of cinnamon in the air mixing with the all too familiar smell of roasting coffee beans and suddenly her apartment feels a lot like a home.</p><p>When Agatha approaches her kitchen she finds Rio in an apron, hair thrown back into a festive claw clip with little elves on it and a piping bag in her hand as she concentrates on layering what appears to be Cinnamon rolls with icing. Between the tinge of frosting on her cheek and the way her tongue is trapped between her teeth in concentration, it’s a toss up at which is cuter. </p><p>“And what do you think you’re doing,” Agatha asks with a teasing lilt, her arms crossed in mock disapproval as she leans against the side of the kitchen door frame. </p><p>Rio looks up to her in surprise, “Oh, you’re up!”</p><p>And then she smiles and Agatha’s breath catches at the sight. She finds herself just standing there like a love struck idiot, drinking in the sight of this woman as if it were her last drop of water in the desert.</p><p>“I’m making cinnamon rolls,” Rio comments as she goes back to layering the icing over the pastry. “It was a tradition for Christmas in my house growing up and it’s just one of those things I’ve always held onto. I normally just buy the Pilsbury can from the store, but I wanted to try something new.”</p><p>Agatha takes that Rio has homemade these by the plethora of ingredients strode across her kitchen island, but even with the giant mess, she’s never been so enamored in her life. She slowly stalks up to Rio’s side and looks down over her girlfriend’s creation. Surprisingly, they look very good.</p><p>“They look amazing, love,” Agatha comments as she leans down and places a kiss to the top of Rio’s head. “They smell really good too. This is your first time making them, you say?”</p><p>Rio nods, “<em>Mhmm</em>, I’ve baked before but it’s only been cookies, croissants and a few loaves of focaccia.”</p><p>Agatha raises a brow, “So you’ve been holding out on me this whole time?”</p><p>Rio laughs, “I said I’ve baked before, not that it was any good.”</p><p>“But was it,” Agatha asks curiously.</p><p>Rio turns to look up at her, a beaming smile on her face as she winks, “Of course.”</p><p>Agatha shoves her lightly with a laugh as she takes a finger and dips it into the icing on top of the rolls, she pulls it to her lips and sucks it into her mouth to taste. She hums in content, “That’s actually really good.”</p><p>Rio chuckles, “Yeah, that’s actually store bought.”</p><p>Agatha gasps, “Cheater!”</p><p>“It’s a compromise, baby,” Rio defends. “You either get homemade cinnamon rolls or homemade icing. I have <em> not </em> got the time to go all out here. We’ve got presents to open! There is Christmas cheer to be had!”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, but there’s a fond smile on her lips, “The cinnamon rolls better be good then.”</p><p>“Oh they will be. <em>Trust</em>.”</p><p>Rio wasn’t lying about her baking being good. All the knowledge she lacks in cooking she makes up for in pastries. The cinnamon rolls are flaky and sweet and absolutely divine. It takes Rio a full twenty minutes to be convinced Agatha isn’t lying to her, but when she finally relents and lets herself be complimented, Agatha can see a monster brewing — Rio is <em> never </em>going to live this down.</p><p>Christmas for Agatha growing up was less about the presents and more about making sure to thank her lord and savior, Jesus Christ. There was an evening church service on Christmas Eve and then they would have their church family back at her mom’s brownstone in Brooklyn and then on Christmas morning they had another church service before their family came over for lunch. Which mostly just consisted of her mother, grandmother, and a few cousins, aunts, and uncles she’d never cared to get to know. She was lucky if she got a plate of food, let alone a present. Something about ‘the undeserving eat last’ and that gave room for her gluttonous cousins to wipe the platters clean. </p><p>So as it turns out, she was wildly underprepared to spend Christmas morning with someone like Rio who had only known leaving cookies out for Santa and sprinkling reindeer food in the yard with her siblings the night before and then waking up at six am, running down the stairs to open presents. Her parents would shuffle in some time later, mom retreating to the stove to start the cinnamon rolls and her dad would ravage the living room with a trash bag to pick up all the leftover wrapping paper. </p><p>They open the presents under the tree that have been itching at Rio ever since she’d seen hers wrapped in a beautiful earthy green wrapping paper that definitely cost just a much, if not more, as the present they are covering where as Agatha gifts are wrapped in a glossy purple wrapping paper Rio had gotten at the store for .99 cents. Regardless, both papers get discarded across the living room, covering the ground in a green and purple collage and Agatha briefly thinks she could get used to this. Just instead of wrapping papers, pieces of <em> them </em> in a confined space together.</p><p>Rio opens her first present to find the Porsche 911 Lego set that she hugs and runs around the couch with for a laps, Agatha recording on her phone the entire time with a smile so bright she doesn’t even need to cut on the flash. When she tells Rio to stand still so she can take a picture, the younger woman holds the set out like a proud trophy before running back over to the tree and swapping her present for one of Agatha’s. She hands it to the other woman and admittedly, Agatha feels a little out of place. </p><p>She tears back the purple wrapping paper with diligent fingers and tries not to look as awkward as she feels, but when she sees a framed photo of what appears to be some grainy security footage, she giggles. Her glasses were perched atop her head but she promptly tucks them back down in an effort to see. When she notices the subject of the photo, her breath hitches.</p><p>It’s them. </p><p>It’s them on the dance floor of Rio’s workplace the night that everything changed. There’s bodies around them, but none stand out the way that Agatha and Rio are nearly one in the same. They’re pushed tightly together, smiles blistering as they dance to a tune only they could hear. </p><p>“That’s the night I knew,” Rio starts, her eyes staring down at the photo. “I knew that I had somehow stumbled my way into one of the best things to ever happen to me.” With a shaky finger, she traces over the outlines of their bodies. “I never thought…”</p><p>Agatha isn’t an emotional crier by any means, but her eyes are welling up with tears despite it. The woman in the photo—that looks a lot like her—only had a taste of what she had found. She couldn’t have possibly known she’d been reliving the moment in the photo on Christmas morning on the floor of her apartment with the same woman. </p><p>“First off, you did not stumble into this. You barged in,” Agatha laughs and makes a pointed effort to chase Rio’s full attention with her eyes until the younger woman turns to her and locks their gaze. As soon as she finds the tears in Rio’s eyes, she reaches out to cup her cheek and soothe the soft skin with the pad of her thumb. “Secondly, I’m so glad that you did.”</p><p>Rio’s smile is bright against the hand on her cheek as she leans into its hold, warming not only her face but Agatha’s heart as well. The moment stays still, neither one of them finding it necessary to break until the older woman finds herself wanting to deflect, “ Don’t get me wrong, you were a pain in the ass.”</p><p>Rio snorts, “It worked didn’t it?”</p><p>“You’re so special Rio Vidal.”</p><p>“And don’t you forget it.” </p><p>Sometime later, still surrounded by paper and boxes emptied of its contents, Agatha’s lounging out on the couch with a coffee in her hand, legs stretched in front of her and a hand playing with the back of Rio’s scalp as the younger girl sits at the coffee table, legs crossed underneath it while she puts together her lego set. </p><p>It’s not the first thought that comes to her brain as she watches Rio building her car intently, but sometime during the process, she feels her heart begin to hurt as the imagine of Rio missing out on a Christmas morning like this for years—the emptiness she must’ve carried in her family's absence.</p><p>“Do you miss it,” Agatha asks softly. “Christmas with your family?”</p><p>It’s a brazen ask, but a necessary one to Agatha. She can see the tears glinting in Rio’s eyes upon resurfacing the memories and she’s grateful to get to know these broken parts of Rio so that she can start helping mend them back together.</p><p>When Rio doesn’t turn to her, but instead makes the coffee table in front of them the most important object in the room, Agatha knows her mistake and gears up for a subject change, but surprisingly, Rio offers a small smile, “Every day that I’m breathing.”</p><p>Agatha returns the soft smile, hoping Rio can feel the way her eyes are gleaming with love against the side of her face, “They didn’t deserve you, Rio.”</p><p>The younger woman nods softly, “I know.”</p><p>“What about your siblings? Do you hear from them,” Agatha shifts the conversation a bit and that’s when she notices Rio’s demeanor changes slightly, her shoulders getting taller and smile turning brighter.</p><p>“Yeah, actually, I hear from my brother a lot now. He was scared at first, still living with my parents and their opinions of me, but when they passed away he reached out to me and we kind of just catch up every now and again. He just moved out to Puerto Rico with a girlfriend. He seems happy,” she muses, fishing around her pocket for her phone before pulling up a picture of him smiling with a young woman, both of them matching flannel pajamas and Agatha gathers that Rio isn’t the only one big on traditions. “He sent this to me this morning.”</p><p>His smile is bright, eyes dark and milky just like Rio’s and Agatha suddenly finds herself yearning to meet a person she feels like she’s already met. </p><p>“We should visit sometime,” Agatha comments to which the younger woman’s eyes widen, but so does her smile.</p><p>“You would do that,” Rio asks.</p><p>Agatha just shakes her head in disbelief, “Darling, when will you learn there isn’t much I <em> wouldn’t </em>do for you.”</p><p>The coffee that she’d been holding nearly splashes to their laps with the speed and velocity in which Rio leans over to kiss her. She tastes like cinnamon, coffee and a promising future. </p><p>The week after Christmas leading up to New Years always feels like a fever dream. No one wants to work and Agatha’s productivity tracker shows it. She’d prepared for this just as she had in years past, but she hadn’t prepared to become one of those very people. Since spending Christmas with Rio and getting a taste of what the holiday season could really be about, she’s found herself taking advantage of the moments that she can get from behind her desk and allow herself to live instead of just existing. </p><p>Lunch breaks are a little longer and she comes back from them <em> actually </em>feeling lighter. Not from the food, but instead her company. Five o’clock is the end of her workday. The long and unforgiving nights at the office are few and far between. She’s got somewhat of a grip on her life for the first time in years. Everything before was calculated with Harkness Enterprises in mind, now mostly everything is calculated in happiness. Gone are the times of doing things just for the sake of doing them. </p><p>Which is how Rio convinces her that they <em> really </em> need to get out of the city for new years and find something different to do. The city would just become overrun with loud and smelly tourists—ever since Rio had found out people <em> actually </em>wear diapers to stand in Times Square she hasn’t let anyone go more than five minutes without a reminder. And well, Agatha isn’t one to deny Rio of anything so she lets herself be convinced in almost a matter of minutes. </p><p>Agatha’s reply had been a sarcastic quip obviously, “Is this where I find out you’re only with me for my money?” </p><p>But she booked two nights in Italy anyway. Rio’s request of course. </p><p>Rio shows up to Agatha’s apartment the night before they are due to leave with her duffle bag and a bright smile. She plops it to her side right as she enters and runs to make herself at home on the couch next to the older woman who has been typing away at an email up until that point. She sets her laptop to the side and pats her lap for Rio to take it’s place. When the younger woman straddles her legs, Agatha settles her hands on her waist.</p><p>“I’m so excited,” Rio whispers excitedly as she beams onto Agatha with her bright smile. She got her hands wrapped around Agatha’s neck, threading her fingers through her long hair and the older woman instantly puddles in her hands. “What time is our flight leaving?”</p><p>Agatha hums, “Whenever you’d like to go. I have Christian on standby to take us to the hangar. Everything’s prepped.”</p><p>Rio knits her brows, “You haven’t booked our flight?”</p><p>Agatha just chuckles, “No darling, we’re taking my private.”</p><p>“<em>Oh</em>, you’re kidding.”</p><p>And that’s how Rio and Agatha end up leaving that night. Rio had simply been too excited to see her private jet and who was Agatha to deny her of that joy? Again, she couldn’t deny her anything. It took a little time to finagle things around and add an extra night to their booking, but with it all said and done, Agatha finds herself contently closing her eyes in the backseat of her SUV, hand resting in Rio’s as Christian drives them to her hangar. </p><p>When they arrived, she had planned to lead Rio to the proper area, but the woman took care of it all on her own as she all but threw herself out of the car and went barreling towards the inside of the hangar. There were a few jets in there—not Agatha’s as she shared the space with a few others—and they occupied Rio’s mind long enough for Agatha and Christian to get their bags from the trunk. </p><p>Agatha approaches Rio some five minutes later as Christian takes to loading their luggage in the proper jet. Rio’s as quiet as Agatha has ever seen her as she ducks around the staggered planes across the expansive space. </p><p>“Are all of these yours,” Rio asks curiously as she runs her hand along a parked black jet. It’s glossy and Agatha can see the way the younger woman is smiling in the reflection. </p><p>“No,” Agatha answers simply with her arms folded across her chest. “These are just some other clients that store here as well. Mine is on the runway getting prepped for us.”</p><p>At that, Rio turns her head to follow where Agatha’s finger is pointing and her eyes light up at the sight of her jet being loaded with their luggage. It’s a small jet, but it’s the first Rio has ever seen in person and that much is clear by the way she’s bouncing on her toes, “I’m <em> really </em>excited now.”</p><p>The older woman laughs fondly, “Me as well. I haven’t seen the inside of it yet since I had the interior re-done a few months ago.”</p><p>Rio looks at her in disbelief, her cheeks tinging pink, “You’re so <em> fucking </em> rich and it’s so <em> fucking </em> hot.”</p><p>“You’re insane,” Agatha laughs, to which Rio just waves her off. It’s not a lie. Rio can definitely be described as insane, but the older woman is starting to release she’s not much better off. Especially when she’d chosen the interior with certain <em> ulterior motives </em> in mind. Motives she’s sure Rio would enjoy as well. “I am excited though. It's <em> very </em> expensive Italian leather. Scratch resistant, water proof…”</p><p>Agatha narrows her gaze at Rio with a visible, daring glint in her eye, “Extremely easy to clean if I may add.”</p><p>Agatha can tell Rio picks up on her intentions with the way she shifts her weight from one foot to the other and swallows visibly. She wants to raise an eyebrow, but doesn’t go for the obvious move and instead shuffles herself into Agatha's personal space and drops her voice to a breathy whisper, “You know, I still haven’t joined the mile high club.”</p><p>Agatha welcomes a smirk to her lips. <em> Bullseye. </em> “Now, that just simply won’t do. We’ll have to rectify that.”</p><p>As they step onto the jet, Agatha’s peacoat is the first article of clothing to hit the floor followed by the NYU hoodie Rio had been wearing. The captain of the jet had taken to getting a few things squared away in the hangar which left the two of them alone for just enough time to scratch a growing itch. Agatha’s backing Rio across the threshold of the jet, pushing the younger woman down into a seat before straddling her waist. Their lips are chapped and cold, but the way they're suddenly trying to devour each other whole fixes that in seconds. Rio’s got her hands tangled in Agatha’s hair, scratching against her scalp with purpose as the older woman takes to burrowing her hands in the skin around Rio’s waist. </p><p>Agatha tries to keep their time limit close to the forefront of her mind but every time her hips grind down against Rio’s <em> very </em> hard midsection, she goes a little blank. Not to mention, the soft pants leaving her lover’s lips start to take precedence over listening for the footsteps of their captain. Clearly, she’s not the only one thinking the same because she can feel Rio reluctantly trying to pull her lips away only to be sucked back in seconds later as if the war she’s raging onto herself is too strong. Though, moments later she does regain some sense to put some space between them with a tug of Agatha’s hair and it does little to help the growing fire between her legs. </p><p>When Rio speaks, her voice is scratchy and she has to clear the lump away, “Let’s put a pause on this before we traumatize the man who has to get us there safely, yeah?”</p><p>Agatha just nods, licking her lips and setting back onto Rio’s thighs, “He’s seen worse.”</p><p>There’s a low growl as Rio shows her distaste for Agatha and her previous escapades, but she nods in agreement anyways and brings her fingers up to wipe the wetness of salvia off of her lips. Agatha watches the entire action with darkened eyes. “After we’re in the air, I make no promises on what he might hear. You’re all mine”</p><p>“Baby,” Agatha whispers breathlessly before leaning forward to capture Rio’s lips again. It really was an involuntary reaction—the kiss. She can’t be blamed for the way Rio makes her body react. It’s just simply not fair. “It’s a long flight. We’ve got all the time in the world.” </p><p>Rio’s eyes soften as she whispers between them, “All the time in the world is still not enough time with you.”</p><p>And then Agatha’s kissing her again, getting caught be damned. </p><p align="center">—</p><p>When they arrive in Italy, Rio’s nearly vibrating off the jet as Agatha sluggishly follows suit, her demeanor much more lagged down from their journey than her companion’s. She silently thanks god that she’d hired temporary assistants to unload their luggage in Christian’s absence because the thought of lifting anything makes her want to say fuck it and sleep on the plane for the remainder of their trip. </p><p>Thankfully that doesn’t have to be an option and the damn near palace Agatha booked for the two of them is only a five minute ride away, so she’s only a few minutes away from a nice nap tucked into expensive sheets and an open window letting in the ocean’s breeze. </p><p>However, Rio’s overly ready to explore so Agatha finds herself traipsing around the city on her last leg, but smiling the entire time because Rio is. They take enough pictures to last a lifetime and eat some of the best food they’ve ever had in their lives that Rio struggles to pronounce and Agatha giggles the entire time. </p><p>When they get back to their place, it’s minutes before they’ve fallen into bed and their quiet snores mix with the sound of waves lapping against rocks. Agatha holds Rio tight like she might slip away in her sleep, but the first thing she feels when she wakes up is Rio’s nose pressing into the nape of her neck. She smiles warmly, pulling her even closer and settling into the sheets feeling excited for the new year for the first time in her life.</p><p>Later that night, they’ll stand on the balcony after giving the oven below a show and watch as the sun sets and the moon rises with champagne in their glasses and smiles creasing their sunburnt cheeks. They’ll kiss at midnight and kiss again a minute after and then a minute after that until there’s too many kisses to count. </p><p>They’ll leave Italy and they’ll go back to lives that are on two completely different paths but manage to intertwine anyways. Agatha will feel Rio’s absence from her daily life harder than she could’ve ever imagined, but Rio sends her more texts, more memes and calls more than she could’ve ever seen herself being grateful for. They’ll meet up for lunch dates and <em> actually </em>digest their days because they aren’t one in the same any longer. </p><p>Until they start spending most evenings and mornings together. Dinner dates with fancy dishes at fancy places, but still plenty of room for Shake Shack mixed in. Rio will finally learn what a Chablis is and Agatha will learn all about dipping your fries in a milkshake and complain the entire time just to hear Rio laugh. They’ll fall back into bed at Agatha’s apartment that will slowly gain the feeling of home she’d been chasing for years with the nightstand opposite her side of the bed containing the bunny eared booked Rio’s been reading, a fleet of half drunken water bottles and a picture of the two of them from some event. </p><p>Her closet will become a space for two. A drawer in her wardrobe will contain Rio’s whimsical socks with characters from nearly every single animated movie Agatha thinks. Her vinyl collection will get played more than it ever has, the silence that once lingered so heavy will be impossible to hear any longer. </p><p>They’ll slow dance in the living room and in the kitchen with the aroma of their dinner mixing between them. Agatha will go through dozens of aprons and Rio will be the one to end up wearing them. </p><p>They’ll have dinner together time and time again, fall in love in a million different ways they could’ve never seen coming. They’ll spend holidays together both at home and abroad. Rio will gain so many stamps on her passport, but the one she’ll treasure the most is the stamp that marks her visit with her brother.</p><p>Agatha will meet him in the sweltering heat of Greece on a trip that neither of them saw coming, but when the invite had been extended, couldn’t say no to. Agatha will see Rio smile brighter and fuller than she has in a long time as she watches her brother say ‘I do’ to the love of his life and then she lets herself imagine what it would be like to finally be married to someone who loves her unconditionally.</p><p>She’ll think about it so much that she’ll buy a ring that’ll warm her pocket on nearly every single outing they go to together. There’s a few more weddings and a vacation or two before Agatha finally plans to get down on one knee. </p><p>They’ll buy a brownstone home in Brooklyn together after touring so many Rio can’t remember one from another, but Agatha promises her that whichever they choose, they will design and repair until it’s absolutely perfect. So when they close on a home and open the front door to a new chapter of their lives, Agatha will get on one knee and Rio will burst into tears after joyfully screaming “<em>what the fuck!” </em></p><p>They’ll laugh and they’ll fight more than they like to. They’ll argue over shower times and which corner the Christmas tree should go into. They’ll have many holiday gatherings, birthday parties and get togethers as they hold onto the friends that loved them separately before they were together. </p><p>Agatha will get to wear an engagement ring she’s actually proud of that later adds a wedding band she can’t stop showing off no matter how many times Jen threatens to hide it from her. Rio will look on proudly, her own ring catching her eye and everything will just sort of start to make sense in life.  </p><p>She’ll save dozens of lives representing youth and Agatha will be her biggest cheerleader around every turn. Matt and her will open a firm and they’ll become some of the best known legal representatives in the city. Somehow, someway Agatha gets the life she’d always dreamed of and everything is in its right place despite her mothers constant warnings.</p><p>They’ll watch their circle grow and then dissipate. They’ll learn who truly loves them and who doesn’t. They’ll eventually find out what it means to truly be a family and they’ll rectify all the mistakes their parents made. </p><p>But all of that comes later. </p>
