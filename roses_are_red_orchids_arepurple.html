     Summary
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      Agatha Harkness is one of the only original shop owners left on the Witches' Road, Westview NJ. Yoga studios and craft breweries have been popping up relentlessly, and over the last decade Agatha's seen her clientele morph from misfits and miscreants to the kind of customer who dares ask her to tattoo them with the likes of Hello Kitty. Enter Rio Vidal, Agatha's new neighbour, nemesis and owner of the Witches' Road Florist.
     </p>

<p>
     Notes
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      I think these two witches are just so neat, and a classic Flower Shop / Tattoo Parlour AU felt like the right thing for them.
     </p>
<p>
      Enjoy :)

     Chapter one
    </h2>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div>
<p>
<em>
      0830, September 30th 2026
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     A clattering sound from the backroom disturbed Agatha from her work. She’d been finishing off a flash sheet of different snakes heads and skulls with intricate vines wrapped around them, something Teen noted would be ‘perfect for spooky season’ - whatever the fuck that was, when a noise that sounded very much like a large box of
     <em>
      small
     </em>
     jewellery falling to the ground rang out.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Shit”, came a groan from the back, “Jen is going to kill me.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice, the source of the noise and Agatha’s former apprentice, was, in her entire fifty-one years on this earth, the most unlucky person Agatha had ever met. Indeed, instances like this happened at least once a week. This time she noticed, hovering in the door frame of the storage room, the younger woman had knocked over a tray of newly autoclaved jewellery that Jen was no doubt planning to use today. Shit indeed.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Jen was Agatha’s piercer. A position she’d been forced to hire as her clientele had slowly but surely evolved over the years, from misfits and miscreants to the kind of sweet young thing who wanted a septum piercing and Hello Kitty tattoo.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      May the record state that while Agatha had given in to the demand for cartilage rings and double nose piercings, she’d burn the entire place to the ground before branding someone with that stupid cartoon cat.
      <span>
</span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
     Anyway, back to the matter at hand. Alice was down on her knees searching for the tiny pieces of jewellery that had rolled every which way when Agatha coughed, making her presence known. The woman looked up at her through too long bangs, a pink blush blooming across her cheeks.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Agatha”, she paused sheepishly, “I, uh, thought your first appointment wasn’t until eleven. How, uh, how are you?” Alice grimaced and stood up, dusting down her black cargo pants and sweeping the jewellery she collected from her hand into the tray.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha just stared her down, raised an eyebrow and spun on her heel. “Alice”, she called over her shoulder, “you’d better pop out and get Jen a coffee to apologise for that sorry state of affairs or she’ll have your guts for garters. And get me my usual while you’re at it.”
    </p>
<p>
     That’s how Alice found herself stuck in the work rush at the local coffee shop, waiting for two flat whites, a tea and Agatha’s ‘usual’ - an appalling order which involved four shots of espresso, vanilla and hazelnut syrup. It was a mystery the woman hadn’t suffered some kind of cardiac incident, or at the very least was able to keep her hands still enough to ink. As she waited, Alice made idle chat with Lilia, the coffee shop’s owner and resident Westview gossip.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Alice darling how are you? All going well at the shop, Agatha’s not overworking you is she.” Alice liked Lilia, she had a kind disposition and had welcomed her to Westview when she moved there after her mother’s death all those years ago. It was Lilia who had gotten her a job as an apprentice with Agatha, after she spent months plagued by bad luck, jumping from job to job all of which ended in disaster. Agatha and Lilia’s friendship was a strange one, not quite maternal, and yet it was clear from their closeness that Lilia had helped Agatha through more than one tough time. Agatha had even recently employed Lilia’s grandson, who went by Teen, as a favour to the coffee shop owner after the boy had been sent to live with her after being kicked out of his boarding school for reasons neither woman had cared to disclose.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     She was brought out of her thoughts by a hand waving in front of her face.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Earth to Alice. I said was everything alright dear, you seem awfully zoned out for nine in the morning.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry Lilia, I was somewhere else. It’s already been a bit of a day, it won’t surprise you to hear that this is an apology coffee run.” She was rewarded with a chuckle from the coffee shop owner, who grasped her hand gently and shook her head.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Oh Alice my dear, whatever are we to do with you. Well, I at least might be able to take your mind off things with some news.” She arched an eyebrow, urging the woman to continue. “Well, it appears that someone is finally moving into the empty shop, across the way from you. In fact, rumour has it the moving vans will be here no later than this afternoon - exciting is it not?”
    </p>
<p>
     Exciting was one word for it, Alice pondered as she walked back with the drinks. She was sure though that it was not the word her boss was going to use when she relayed the information. Agatha was territorial by nature, and the idea that someone unknown to the small town of Westview taking over the space opposite her shop would likely put her in a foul mood for the rest of the week. She was even debating keeping the news to herself, loath to start her day on an even worse foot than she already had, when she spotted a car pulled up on the opposite side of the road to Agatha’s that certainly hadn’t been there when she left.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     A woman was rummaging around in the boot of the car, and emerged triumphantly, just as Alice reached the door of the tattoo parlour, key dangling from her hand. Alice stopped a moment to observe.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     She was beautiful, in a scary sort of way. Long dark hair, lots of kohl eyeliner and wearing tight black pants and a dark green blouse. She looked to be a little older than Alice, early forties maybe, and in the hand that didn’t hold the key she clutched a small plant pot with a purple orchid sprouting from it. Alice was still observing her when the woman unlocked the shop door and turned to push it open, meeting her gaze. The orchid lady smirked and gave Alice a wink, somewhere between sexy and deeply unnerving. Unsure where to go from here, and now painfully aware that this was something she could no longer keep from her boss, Alice retreated into her own shop and laid the coffees down on the reception desk.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Teen”, she looked at the newest member of their team, who was currently manning said reception desk, ”how would you like to break some really fun, great news to aunty Agatha.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     The Teen baulked at the moniker Alice had given his boss. Sure he liked Agatha well enough, she was cool, if a touch overdramatic, and had done him a real solid offering the reception gig after what went down last summer. But ‘Aunt’ was a bit much and more to the point, if the woman in question heard herself being referred to as such she would surely flip her shit.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Why do I feel like whatever the news is will be neither fun, nor great, Alice?”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Right, okay fine. Not great and not fun. It looks like someone has moved into the shop next door.”
    </p>
<p>
     “What!” Agatha made Alice jump for the second time that day. The younger woman gave Teen a look and spun to face her boss.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Yeah, so, good news - we have neighbours again.” She put on a fake cheery voice in the hope it might appease - only to be met with Agatha mimicking the line back to her in an affected, childlike whine.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha was not a people person. Sure, she had her employees and Lilia who she
     <em>
      tolerated
     </em>
     , but aside from that she was about as unneighbourly as they come. This was clear enough from the relationship she’d had with the previous shop owners, and the ones before that, and before that. It wasn’t that she felt intimidated by a new business opening, her own business was booming and she was confident that wouldn’t change. No, it was the change in status quo that they brought, people in Westview that had no business being there, the types for instance who would come into her shop and ask for Hello Kitty tattoos. Sure things change, and in her defence Agatha knows she’s unable to stop them from doing so, but she sure as hell can help these yuppies from speeding the process up with their craft breweries, pilates studios and vegan beauty stores.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Anyway, this new neighbour of ours”, Agatha continued, tone trying to remain unaffected, “do we know what kind of shop they’re setting up?” Before she could get an answer, the bell above the door chimed and all three heads swivelled towards the sound.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “M’lady.” A woman with dark hair, too tight pants and more kohl eyeliner than the Teen sauntered through the door and over to Agatha. She held out a pot with a purple orchid towards her and bent into a strange half curtsey, half bow. “I’ve just moved into the neighbourhood, pleasure to make your acquaintance.”

     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio eased her foot off the gas, slowing to read the large sign that declared:
     <em>
      Welcome to Westview,
     </em>
     and below that,
     <em>
      “Home: It’s Where You Make It”
     </em>
     . She sure hoped that was the case as she thought about all her worldly possessions that would arrive in a few hours time, accompanying her to the place she had decided would become
     <em>
      home
     </em>
     .
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Sometime after 39th birthday, Rio had decided she needed a change. She couldn’t pinpoint one specific moment that had cemented the decision, a mediocre therapist might theorise that it was the thought of turning 40, or perhaps the fear that she had nothing but a string of vengeful ex-girlfriends and a failed business to show for it - Rio hated therapists. No. She was quite certain that it was just regular old antsy-ness, a need to get out of the monotony of her day-to-day existence and uproot herself (if you’ll pardon the pun) to somewhere more exciting.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Exciting was perhaps not the word you’d use to describe Westview. Not that she’d ever been. Rio had heard of the small town in New Jersey from an old mentor of hers, who had retired there following the death of her husband a few years ago. Sharon Davies had been a big part of Rio’s formative years, teaching her everything there was to know about the flora and fauna that had interested her as a teenager. She’d often spend the hours after school under Mrs. Davies tutelage, and when she left for college Sharon was the only person from her hometown that Rio bothered to keep in contact with.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Anyways. Westview.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Driving through the town now, Rio could see the appeal it had to those pushing seventy. And actually, as she cruised down Main Street and turned on to the Witches’ Road it was clear that even the younger generation had made their mark on the town. She passed a smoothie bar with an
     <em>
      Instagram-able
     </em>
     shop window, followed by a mini-market selling ‘Home Grown Produce’ which included a punnet of strawberries at the very reasonable price of eleven dollars. She grimaced at that but continued to make her way down the road, her SatNav reminding her she was only 400 yards from her destination.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Pulling into the space outside the empty store front, Rio turned off the car and sat for a moment to further take in her surroundings. To the left, her new venture, and above it, her humble abode. To the right. Rio took her seatbelt off and twisted to get a better view. To the right a large glass window, behind which stood one of the most attractive women Rio had seen in a long time.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     The woman in question looked to be in her early fifties, with long hair that had an untamed quality to it. She was wearing smart purple chinos and a white blouse that was open almost to her sternum, with the sleeves rolled up and a black lace camisole underneath. Tattoos adorned both forearms and from the the looks of it much of her upper body, stopping around her collar bones, where Rio could make out what she assumed to be two snakes slithering across her décolletage. Her hands were free of jewellery and she seemed to be gesticulating wildly to a teenage boy who stood behind the counter, and looked somewhere between amused and afraid. It was impossible to understand what exactly they were discussing, but by the looks of things the woman was acting out someone knocking something over. Before she could figure out anymore of the conversation, it seemed the woman was needed elsewhere as she spun on her heels with a dramatic flick of her hair and disappeared into the shop until Rio could no longer see her.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Okay. Rio thought. Now this is promising.
    </p>
<p>
     Getting out of her car, the woman pondered her new neighbour - she seemed feisty, perhaps overdramatic and definitely hot. A mean combination and certainly one that would supply Rio with all manner of entertainment as she got to know her new home town. She opened the boot of her car, the back of which was filled with some of her more delicate plants, those she didn’t trust to be transported by the big lugs that worked for the company moving her entire life across the country. All still in one piece she was pleased to see. Now, if only she could find the keys to the shop. Aha. Rio spotted them in the corner of the boot, glinting in the morning sunlight behind a beautiful purple orchid. She went to grab them and as she did so, made a split second decision to pick up the plant too. What luck that it seemed to be the perfect match for her new neighbour’s aesthetic. So perfect in fact, it would be rude not to share it, a welcoming gift of sorts.
    </p>
<p>
     Making her decision she slammed the boot and put the keys in the lock, turning her should to push her way into the empty shop. As she did so, she caught the eye of a woman standing directly opposite, trying to look like she hadn’t been staring. Rio gave the younger woman a grin and a wink before shouldering her way into her new life.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      0930, 30th September 2026
      <span>
</span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio crossed the road, purple orchid in hand, and pushed open the door to the tattoo parlour. The two women and teenage boy all turned to stare at her as she sauntered over to - hot neighbour didn’t seem like it would do the woman in the purple pants justice - “M’lady”, Rio decided at the last minute. She then made a point of entering a half bow before continuing, “I’ve just moved into the neighbourhood, pleasure to make your acquaintance.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     It took all Agatha’s control not to wrench the flower out of the woman’s hand and throw it to the floor. But the fact she didn’t, she reflected briefly, was growth. Instead, she pursed her lips and gave a low hum as the woman returned to her full height and handed her the flower, seemingly undeterred by Agatha’s lack of reaction. The older woman had no choice really but to take the thing, which was admittedly quite lovely, with its mauve petals and deep green leaves. She coughed, awkwardly, before remembering herself.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “If you expect me to say the pleasure is all mine, then you’re sorely mistaken.” She huffed, putting the flower to the side without a word of thanks. “Last thing Westview needs is another overpriced haven for these influencer types to hang out in, it’s a disgrace.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, don’t be rude.”
    </p>
<p>
     Teen better thank his lucky stars that Lilia was his grandmother, taking a tone like that with her. She scowled at him anyways for good measure.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Agatha,” the orchid-barer practically growled her name out, “a beautiful name, and a beautiful place you have here - very homely.” As if to make her point the woman plonked herself down on the couch by reception and threw both arms over the back, stretching out like a cat. “So, tell me about yourself, what is it you do here?” She picked up the booklet of designs on the table and began to leaf through.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Well,” Agatha snatched the book from her hand, “assuming you’re neither blind nor illiterate, I’m sure you can make those deductions for yourself. Now, if you don’t mind I have work to do, as I’m sure you do.” She ignored both Alice and Teen who were visibly cringing as she held the door open for the new neighbour, who had yet to move from her seat but looked to be enjoying herself despite the hostile atmosphere. Eventually, she rose from the sofa before going over to Agatha’s two employees and shaking their hands.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “It’s been a pleasure,” she looked down at Teen’s name badge, “Teen. And, you too”, she paused waiting for Alice to offer up her name - which she did so, with a light blush.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “And Agatha,” she invaded the older woman’s space as she stepped through the door, “I just know we’re going to be
     <em>
      great
     </em>
     friends. Te veo.” She fixed her with a smirk before exiting the shop, leaving the group in a somewhat stunned silence until Jen popped her head round the door.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Who was
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     .” She sounded amused. “Do I hate her, or do I want her phone number?”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Right,” Alice turned to her in agreement. Agatha on the other hand was still hovering in the doorway, scowl on her face as she watched her new neighbour ferrying small plants from her car into the new shop, all whilst wearing those impossibly tight trousers and sporting a grin that bordered on manic.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      2120, 30th September 2026
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha flopped on Lilia’s couch, exhausted from a day of inking and angsting over the new neighbour - not that she would admit the latter. She did her best to put the woman, whose name she had yet to learn, to the back of her mind. Something easier said than done it turned out.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha darling,” Lilia started, handing her a glass of wine as she went to take her own seat on the couch, “a little birdie tells me you received a visit from our new resident today. Do tell, what is she like? I’ve heard all sorts from the town already, some are even saying she’s Sharon’s goddaughter.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Who’s Sharon?”, was all Agatha said in reply.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “You know Sharon, darling. Sharon Davies. Mrs. Hart?”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Oh that old crone. So our darling new neighbour is a little nepo-bitch then?” Sharon Davies was well know amongst townsfolk, moving to Westview not long after the death of her husband, and even less time after leaving her role as Mrs. Hart on a popular daytime soap that Agatha had
     <em>
      claimed
     </em>
     never to have watched.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Agatha, the woman owns a florist. I’d hardly count that as nepotism, and besides, why must you be so hostile to every poor soul who moves onto the Road? You’re never going to find a girlfriend with that attitude you know.” Agatha choked on her wine.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Jesus, alright Lilia, no need for that. And I thought we were talking about the nepo-bitch, not girlfriends, so back on the subject please
     <em>
      dear
     </em>
     .”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Right, of course, of course. Well anyways, what has she done to rub you up the wrong way already. From what I’ve heard Rio’s a nice girl, a little
     <span>
</span>
     odd perhaps, but a hard worker and”, she seemed to consider her words, “sweet.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha’s huffed out a breath and took a deep swig of her wine. “Well, I’m not sure sweet is quite right”, she smirked.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Oh is that right? How would you describe her then, hmmm.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha hadn’t yet had enough wine to be lured into this trap and so she merely shrugged her shoulders. “Annoying, overconfident, a brat.” Actually, the heat creeping up her cheeks was perhaps an indication that she had had too much wine, even if this was only her first glass.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Lilia just sat back, watching her with that look she sometimes got, like she could see into your future.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “It sounds like she made an impression at least.” Pause. “More wine?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha just nodded, rearranging her face back into its signature scowl.

      9th October 2026
      <span>
</span>

</p>
<p>
     It’d been just over a week since Rio had arrived in Westview, and finally she had managed to set up shop and move everything into the small apartment above it. Her days had mostly been filled with painting walls, unpacking plants and collecting orders, though she had managed to take the occasional break to wander around, grab a coffee and slowly get to know the residents of the quaint New Jersey town. A few days after arriving she’d even payed Sharon a visit, having not seen the woman in person for almost a year. This proved to be a fruitful adventure for a number of reasons. Firstly, she’d been given a full rundown of the best places in Westview to go for drinks, dinner, spin class - Rio doubted she’d be investigating the latter - and secondly, because she’d been able to get the lowdown on her new neighbour.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha Harkness, it turned out, was somewhat of a big name in town. She’d owned her tattoo parlour on the Witches’ Road for coming on thirty years, having inherited the space at the ripe old age of 22, after her mother’s untimely death. Since then she’d seen the road transform, and by Sharon and the rest of towns’ accounts, was not best pleased about it. Many had incurred her wrath over the years, and in one notable incident she had even dyed her neighbour’s dog bright purple. Unprovoked. All in all the word on the street seemed to be,
     <em>
      don’t fuck with Agatha Harkness if you value you sanity.
      <span>
</span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio thought she might be in love.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Unfortunately, since the day she arrived Rio had not had the chance to see nor speak to the woman. She had however bumped into the one with orange streaks through her hair, who seemed to be inordinately clumsy. Rio knew this because on three separate occasions she had seen her spill, drop or break something through the window of Agatha’s shop. Not that she’d been staring, or trying to get a glimpse of its owner - she was merely being neighbourly. Anyway, the third thing that Alison, Alicia - whatever her name was - had dropped was a tray of coffees. Rio saw her be sent straight back out again by the Teen and a tall, dark, pretty woman dressed head to toe in a shade of pink that was borderline offensive. So, ever the opportunist, Rio had decided that was a good a time as ever to do her own coffee run.
    </p>
<p>
     That’s how she’d found Lilia’s. It was a smaller coffee shop, tucked away off the main high street and weirdly, not one that had been recommended to her by Sharon - despite the coffee being really quite fantastic. A story there for another day perhaps.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Lilia’s not only did an excellent coffee, its owner also proved to have an excellent grasp of the comings and goings of Westview in its entirety. Rio had been immediately drawn to Lilia, an older woman who would’ve made an excellent witch in another life (or perhaps in this one, who could say). She had greeted Rio like an old friend, and seemed to know way more about her than was socially acceptable for someone you’ve never met. Something Rio found to be both amusing and impressive.
     <span>
</span>
     She’d gotten chatting to the woman and through her had been introduced - or re-introduced she supposed - to Ali, Allicent, Agatha’s employee. That was who she was speaking to now. Well speaking to may be the wrong phrase as the woman was looking at her expectantly as if waiting for an answer of some kind.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Sorry, would you mind awfully repeating that? I was quite away with the fairies.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, uh, sure. I was just saying that you should come down to Lilia’s this evening. She does a live music night on a Friday and lots of us on the Witches’ Road come down for it. What do you think?” Alice, that was her name Rio remembered, looked hopeful and gave Rio a nervous smile.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Well darling, who am I to say no to a little live music on a Friday night. Does this place have a liquor licence?” Alice’s smile turned from nervous to mischievous in an instant.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ah. Now that’s where Agatha comes in. You remember Agatha right? Long hair, lots of enormously scary tattoos, short but makes up for it in personality.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Rio snorted. “Yeah, yeah I remember Agatha - she’s a hard one to forget I think. But care to enlighten me on what I can only assume are her illegal booze smuggling activities?” She raised an eyebrow.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Let’s not throw around words like illegal.” Lilia appeared from behind Rio, making her jump. “I’d like to think of it more as prohibition appropriation, let’s say. And we’d love to have you Rio, 9pm sharp.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     It was clear the woman wouldn’t take no for an answer, not that Rio was planning to go back on her promise to attend - especially now that a certain small woman with enormously scary tattoos was involved.
    </p>
<p>
     After assuring them she would be in attendance, the brunette bid both women goodbye and headed back to her flower shop where she was making the finishing touches for Monday’s opening.
    </p>
<p>
     “So,” Lilia turned to Alice after watching their newest resident leave and do a funny little hop, skip and jump down the pavement. “What do we think, she’s peculiar right? I think so. I like it.” She did not give Alice a chance to answer. “I wish Agatha would be more receptive to her. I know for a fact that she’s been avoiding bumping into her after their first meeting, thought I can’t imagine why. She normally loves to terrorise the new shop owners straight off the bat.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Alice took this moment to jump in. “I don’t know, it seems like she might be planning something. I saw her and Teen huddled over the desk the other day, and I may be wrong but I could’ve
     <em>
      sworn
     </em>
     they had blueprints for Rio’s shop. I mean it may be nothing, but I’ve known that woman a long time - as have you - and wouldn’t be surprised if she’s got something up her sleeve.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Lilia’s look was one of exasperation.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “The mind boggles with that one. And as for thinking it was ever a good idea to introduce her to Teen, well I don’t know. I just hope that whatever it is they have planned, Rio won’t take it too badly. She seems like she could rub off well on Agatha, and from the look on her face when you told her she’d be involved in the live music night, I’d be inclined to thinks she feels the same way.” Lilia smirked and raised an eyebrow.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Oh god, I did not need that mental image woman.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     The older woman just chuckled and slid Alice’s coffees towards her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Apologies darling. You best get off before I traumatise you further. I’ll see you this evening?”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Oh you betcha, and I’ll let you know if I get any closer to uncovering exactly what it is that Teen and Agatha are plotting. See you later Lilia.” With that the woman picked up her drinks and made a beeline for the door, careful not to knock into anyone as she went.

<em>
      9th October 2026 - Evening
      <span>
</span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha sat in front of her dresser, wrapped in a towel as she ran a brush through a mass of wet, tangled hair. She had promised to show at Lilia’s live music night that evening, bringing with her the usual supply of beers and cheap wine that the two would sell to guests out of the boot of Agatha’s car - which she parked in the alley down the side of the coffee shop. It was a gig they’d perfected over the last two or three years, and one that the Westview Police Department tended to turn a blind eye towards on account of the fact it made their own Friday nights much quieter.
    </p>
<p>
     Having tamed her hair into something vaguely acceptable, she turned to her makeup. A sweep of dark purple shadow across the eyelids with a touch of eyeliner and a lick of mascara, the usual affair, finished off with a pink lipgloss. Working as a tattoo artist meant she often left her rings at home, but tonight she decided to slide them on - a couple of chunky gold stacks as well as a thumb ring with a purple gemstone and a few bangles round her wrists. Agatha wasn’t vain per se, but she was also aware that she wasn’t the worst looking person around. Indeed, despite not being a mother herself, Teen had told her on several occasions that she was a milf. Something she wasn’t keen to unpack but was nonetheless pleased about.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Moving across to her wardrobe she selected her outfit for the night. Black dress pants with a matching waistcoat - no need for a bra underneath - and a heavy wool coat to combat the recent chill in the air. She ended up doing two laps of the apartment before finding the shoes she was looking for, a pair of cream loafers with gold buckles, and finally threw her hair into something that resembled a bun, minus a few flyaways. Grabbing her keys and bidding farewell to Señor Scratchy she left the flat and made her way to Lilia’s.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     The band were already setting up when Agatha entered the coffee shop that evening. She gave them a wave before making her way into the back room where she knew she’d find Lilia and, most likely, Teen.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “What’s a girl gotta do to get a drink around here.” She did her best impression of a Western drawl, one that may need work based on Lilia and Teen’s laughing faces.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Agatha dear, good to see you too.” She swatted the older woman away as she tried, as always, to hug her. Teen gave her a quick wave and a thumbs up that she wasn’t entirely sure the meaning of.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     They wandered out the back to where she’d parked the car, and set up in the usual manner - this more or less involved Agatha sitting on the edge of the boot with crates of beer and wine at her feet and plastic cups, should her patrons wish to feel a little more classy. That would normally be her for the night. She could hear the live music through the open side door, and would make occasional chatter to the other cafe-dwellers who came out for a drink, it was in her mind the perfect night. No need to pretend to be enjoying the company of the insufferable ‘bros’ that owned the local shops around her, nor make inane chat to the yoga girls and women who’s personalities revolved entirely around skin care and vegetables - yuck. If she was lucky, she might even get high off her own supply.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     By half past nine the night was in full swing and Agatha had a pleasant buzz on as she doled out cups of wine and bottles of beer just on the wrong side of warm. In fact, she was ready to consider the evening a roaring success until she spotted the woman hovering at the side door, rocking slightly on her heels and grinning.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha let out a groan. She was going to kill Lilia.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Since her first meeting with Rio, Agatha had been doing her best to avoid the woman. Her hackles had been raised after the orchid incident and along with Teen she’d decided that her normal combative approach wasn’t going to work. Instead the two had spent the better part of the last week plotting how best to run their new neighbour out of town. Initially, they’d decided the best approach would be to slowly turn the town against her, something that was easier said than done considering Agatha’s own stand-offish personality and lack of repartee with the folks of Westview.
     <span>
</span>
     She’d even sent Teen out to do some recon and unfortunately, it wasn’t good news. Despite the doors to Rio’s flower shop not having opened, it seemed the woman was already making a name for herself in town. She’d befriended Alice - much to Agatha’s chagrin - and according to Teen, was known and liked by a number of the yummy-mummies and their boring husbands. This latter point was somewhat conflicting with the image that Agatha had painted of Rio - not that she’d spent much time thinking about her. But, if she had, she imagined the woman to be more hard around the edges, a bit of a kook and not the type of person to be hanging around in yoga pants with a water bottle bigger than her head.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Stood in the doorframe, Rio didn’t seem like the type that would appeal to these vacuous blondes. She was dressed in another obscenely tight pair of pants, this time paired with a black top that had a deep v-neck and wispy gold threads across the arms and bodice. Her hair was loose and thin gold chains hung round her neck, dipping at her cleavage. Nothing like the heinous getups of some of the women she’d seen tonight.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha was dragged out of her musings as Rio approached her. She had the audacity to grab a bottle of beer and pull herself up onto the edge of the boot so she was sat shoulder to shoulder with the tattoo artist.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Hey neighbour.” Rio took a swig of her beer before continuing. “Alice said I’d find you out here, how’ve you been keeping? Have you had a good week.” Though her tone was nothing but polite, Agatha could detect an underlying amusement, her words intended to taunt. She wouldn’t rise to the bait, opting to say nothing.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, I’ve had a lovely week thanks for asking. You’ll be pleased to hear the shop’s coming along nicely and I’ve already made some
     <em>
      lovely
     </em>
     friends in this town. Gosh, everyone’s just so darn sweet - dontcha think?” Rio was outwardly chuckling now as Agatha continued to fix her with the best glower she could. “You know, when Lilia invited me here I thought, well how lovely. What a great way to get to know the rest of town, so many interesting people. Did you know the couple who own the whole foods place on the Witches’ Road have just had their
     <em>
      third
     </em>
     child, and that their first is a cello prodigy? Just absolutely
     <em>
      fascinating
     </em>
     stuff, really.” As she said the last part of the sentence, Rio pitched her voice to an almost perfect imitation of Jane, the unbearable woman who owned said whole foods shop. This - despite her best efforts - made Agatha’s mouth turn up at the corners, a hint of laughter in her eyes.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Something Rio clocked immediately.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Now don’t tell me you find that funny Ms. Harkness.” She continued to imitate Jane’s voice. “Are you not just
     <em>
      thrilled
     </em>
     that little Abigail may one day be first chair in Westview’s very own orchestra. Because I sure am.” Agatha couldn’t help but let out an involuntary snort of laughter - she knew she shouldn’t have had so many beers.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     At this, Rio looked genuinely thrilled.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “You’re a fuckin’ weirdo, you know that right?” Agatha directed towards the woman who made her point entirely by replying with a mock bow. “Don’t you have something better to do anyway, then sitting here annoying me? If I know Lilia, and I do, she’ll be dying to show you off to her little coven.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Coven, hm?” Was all Rio said in reply.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Yeah, it’s like her close group of girlfriends or whatever. Most of them old bats like her. They’d just love you I’m sure, a real treat for them having some new blood in town. If you’re lucky, they might even set you up with one of their ugly sons.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     It was Rio’s turn to let out a snort of laughter.
    </p>
<p>
     “Now Agatha, you really are hoot.” She clinked the edge of her beer bottle against Agatha’s now empty one. “Is this how you get all the girls?” The older woman let out a small huff.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll have you know I’d have no trouble getting girls if you weren’t sat here, harshing my vibe with your insane chat.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Oh really, because I don’t see a queue forming out here?” As she said this, Rio moved closer, voice low and breathy against her ear. The hairs on Agatha’s neck stood up - something she was definitely going to put down to the chill in the air. She was about to reply when a voice called out from the side door.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Ah Rio, there you are.” Lilia stepped out into the street, wrapped in a large fur coat, befitting of Hollywood royalty. “Dear there’s someone inside that I’m just dying for you to meet. Grab me a beer would you and I’ll introduce you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Guess that’s my cue.” Rio gave Agatha a wink and what was becoming her signature smirk, before grabbing two beers from the crate at her feet. “Te veo, Agatha.” Again this was whispered into the older woman’s ear, and Rio took off before she had a chance to reply.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     It took Agatha a few seconds to recover before she realised something.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Hey… Hey! You owe me twelve dollars. Bitch.” She muttered the last word under her breath, but it was too late anyway, the younger woman was gone.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took the lid off another beer and chugged half the bottle.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Yeah, she was really going to have to do something about that neighbour.

<em>
      13th October 2026 - Morning
      <span>
</span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
     Jen, by all accounts, was an independent woman with her own mind who made her own choices. Thank you very much. That being said, there were some exceptions to the rule and almost all of them involved Agatha Harkness. On this particular occasion, the woman had her on a quote un-quote
     <em>
      undercover mission
     </em>
     . This was insane for several reasons, firstly, Agatha was a fully grown woman and tattoo artist, not an FBI handler. Secondly, Jen was - as she said - an independent woman, with her own mind and the ability to say no to spending her lunch hour playing Nancy Drew.
    </p>
<p>
     Unfortunately, she hadn’t exercised that particular ability and so found herself tucked between the fronds of a luscious green fern, looking overly interested in the potted plants in front of her. Residents of Westview bustled around, picking up pre-made bouquets or gently caressing the leaves of monsteras, money trees and some frankly dangerous-looking succulents.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Rio’s shop had been open a day, and yet it was clear that news of the green oasis on the Witches’ Road had travelled fast. Mums and children, first loves, old men and sullen youths had been pouring in and out of the doors since they opened at eight o’clock that morning. This was part of the reason that Jen was there incognito, to understand why Westview had developed a sudden intense interest in horticulture. The other reason was Agatha’s ridiculous attempt to bury her
     <em>
      incredibly
     </em>
     obvious crush on the new shop owner. Her and Teen had concocted some harebrained scheme to
     <em>
      reclaim the former glory of the Witches’ Road
     </em>
     , but Jen was quite sure that if Rio were to leave Westview, her boss would be anything but pleased.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Speaking of Agatha and Teen, the two had cornered Jen just as she was planning to grab a coffee and sandwich from Lilia’s. Spouting some nonsense about how only Jen could do this, because Rio was already friends with Alice and Lilia, and Teen was a
     <em>
      terrible
     </em>
     spy and Agatha was
     <em>
      too
     </em>
     obvious a choice, they had coerced her into agreeing to visit the shop and figure out what kind of magic hold Rio had on the townsfolk to lure in so many visitors. Jen suspected the only magic to be found was the so-called magic of new blood in a town that rarely saw any action, and whose most famous inhabitant was a soap star-come-widower. The fact said widower was also rumoured to be Rio’s godmother or grandmother or mentor (depending on who you asked), likely played a part.
    </p>
<p>
     Teen and Agatha were hearing none of it though and ushered Jen out the door, urging her to do a lap of the block before going into Rio’s. Again, insane.
    </p>
<p>
     And yes, she may have become embroiled in the insanity, but Jen was also not one to give up easy. She had a task and she would complete it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Now that is just beautiful.” Jen turned to the man next to her, commenting on a tall thin plant with tiny white flowers he’d just picked up to admire.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Isn’t it just. I’m looking for an anniversary gift for my husband and when I heard Rio’s had opened I knew it would be the perfect place to go.” The man gave her a broad smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “And where did you hear about it? I only realised it had opened when I walked past on the way to work yesterday.” Lie. Jen had heard of very little else since Rio had parked her car opposite Agatha’s almost two weeks ago.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Oh really. This place has been the talk of the town over the weekend. Apparently, Sarah found out from John who found out from Lilia that Sharon Davies was even her mentor back in the day. And Jane down the road has been to yoga with her - Rio that is, not Sharon - and she’s got this amazing aura and like, zen thing going on.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     And there it was. No magic after all, just the draw of someone they considered to be
     <em>
      more than.
      <span>
</span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
     Still
     <em>
      ,
     </em>
     Jen was surprised at the man’s description. Alice had struck up something of a friendship with the new florist and her accounts were nothing like the picture being painted of a woman who was mindful, polite and wore yoga pants. Indeed, despite only having had a brief encounter with Rio on the day she came in with the orchid, Jen got the impression she was flirtatious and sarcastic and a little bit weird. More than that, it seemed impossible that someone with
     <em>
      an amazing aura
     </em>
     would pique Agatha’s attention in the way it had. A way that went beyond her usual dismissal and outward dislike of fellow shop owners and Westview residents, and veered more into the territory of her own misguided flirtation - like the time she’d dyed Wanda’s dog purple. Unprovoked.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Perhaps the less said about Wanda the better. Back to the matter at hand.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “I had no idea, that is exciting isn’t it. Well, I best let you get back to your day but it was lovely to meet you, and I’m sure your husband will love the gift.” Jen pushed through the throng of people queuing to pay and headed for the exit. She was sure though, that a pair of warm brown eyes followed her as she made her way out of the shop and back over to the tattoo parlour.
    </p>

     Rio closed up shop just before six. Her first two days had been a resounding success and it was clear that in Westview, word of mouth beat any kind of social media strategy. She’d chatted to all sorts of people from the town, letting herself morph into different personas as she spoke to customers. It was something she’d done for years as a way to alleviate boredom. Pretend she was into rock climbing, or rock music, yoga or Morris dancing, finding ways to pull on people’s heart strings and draw them in - best friends with everyone and no-one.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     As a child, Rio had a lot of imaginary friends. As she’d gotten older she created versions of herself that people didn’t find weird and off-putting, and which helped her blend in when she needed. It was how she’d found herself in a sorority in college and at a yoga class with Jane down the road. It was also the reason she’d decided to move to Westview, having superficial relationships with people meant she had little reason to stay.
    </p>
<p>
     It sounds sad. It shouldn’t.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     It’s not like Rio couldn’t form genuine friendships. In fact, she was sure that she was finding a true friend in Alice and, to an extent, Lilia. No. It was just that Rio was an acquired taste and sometimes to get ahead you need to be what people want to see. With Westview, she could tell that most people wanted to see a
     <em>
      cool girl
     </em>
     . The women want you to go to their exercise classes and drink smoothies and not flirt with their husbands, the men want you to drink beers and chat about sports and - it turns out - not flirt with their wives. Okay, so Rio wasn’t perfect.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     That was most of the people in Westview anyways.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     She clocked the moment Agatha’s employee had stepped through her door. Though they hadn’t been formally introduced, Rio was aware of the piercer from Alice and, from her slightly awkward demeanour, was pretty sure she hadn’t come into the shop on a personal errand. Rio preened at the thought of Agatha sending one of her minions to spy for her, only slightly disappointed that the woman didn’t seek her out in person. The piercer hadn’t spent long in the shop but she had found time to chat to a man Rio vaguely remembered from the cafe on Friday, and no doubt decided she had enough to report back on. It was by-the-by what the woman passed onto Agatha, as she was sure her generally threatening aura was more for show than anything. However, it did give Rio the perfect excuse to pay the tattoo artist a visit.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha was the last person in the shop. She’d locked up the till and emptied the bins, ready to call it a day, when the bell above the door jangled.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry, we’re closed.” She called, not bothering to look over her shoulder as she jumped up on tiptoes to try and put a folder of designs on the high shelf by the desk.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Need some help there hot-stuff.” The shorter woman jumped at the sound of a low voice, much closer than expected.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Holy shit, Rio. Scare a woman half to death why don’t you.” Agatha spun around to face her neighbour who had perched herself on the edge of the reception desk, about a foot from where she stood. The younger woman chuckled and hopped off, grabbing the folder from Agatha’s hand in one swift motion. She didn’t even bother to move round her, instead stepping into Agatha’s space and leaning in to put the book back in its rightful slot behind her head.
    </p>
<p>
     “What do you think you’re doing?” Agatha huffed out, the woman still very much in her personal space and making it difficult to focus. Rio didn’t say anything for a moment, only the sounds of their breathing permeating the air. Then she broke the spell, jumping back up onto the desk and swinging her legs.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Just being neighbourly. Can’t a girl help a fellow shop-owner in need?”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Right. Neighbourly. Well neighbour, I’m sure you didn’t come over just because you were worried I couldn’t reach the top shelf. So tell me, why are you here?” Agatha had intended her tone to have more bite, but instead it came out breathy and more amused than affronted.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “I saw your little spy at my shop today. If you wanted to know what I was doing for lunch, you just had to ask.” Rio batted her eyelashes.
    </p>
<p>
     Shit. Agatha knew she shouldn’t have let Teen convince her to send Jen in, she wasn’t stranger enough to the florist and if nothing else had come back with fairly useless information. Nothing damning that Agatha could use as ammunition to drive Rio out of Westview.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t be coy,
     <em>
      Agatha.
     </em>
     ” The younger woman dragged the syllables of Agatha’s name out in a way that send a pleasant shiver down her spine. Something she chose to ignore.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Look Rio, I don’t know why you think I’d care what you’re up to, or why I’d have reason to
     <em>
      spy
     </em>
     on you. But whatever you think was happening, I can assure you you’re wrong.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Is that so. Are you telling me that if I was to go to Alice this evening, and ask her what she knows about your little scheme, she’d have absolutely no idea what I was talking about?” She smirked at Agatha’s hesitation, pleased to have caught the woman out.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Fine, fine. But it wasn’t spying, I was being an upstanding member of the community. Who knows what’s going on in that shop of yours. I saw a bunch of kids hanging out outside it earlier, are you growing weed, selling drugs to them on the side?”
    </p>
<p>
     “And if I was?” Rio leaned forward, back to invading Agatha’s personal space. Close enough to hear the other woman’s breath hitch.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “I, uh,” She took a moment to gather herself. “I’d obviously have to report you to Westview Police, as the upstanding citizen I am.” There you go, composed and scary, easy.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Rio just laughed.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Of course you are. The same upstanding citizen who sells booze illegally out of the boot of her car, and spies on her neighbours?”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Call it even?” The tattoo artist gave a little smirk of her own.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re a funny thing, Agatha Harkness. You should come see my shop for yourself some time, we could not smoke weed and not drink your shitty wine. What do you think?”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     It was hard to say no with the woman stood so close, breathing the same air and giving her a flirtatious sort of smile. Luckily, Agatha was a strong woman. Sort of.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “I think, that I’m closing and you need to get out of my shop so I can go home. See you around, Vidal.” The older woman stepped out of Rio’s space to usher her out of the door - a repeat of the first time they’d met.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “I never told you my surname.”
    </p>
<p>
     “People talk.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “They do, if you ask them. Goodnight Agatha, dulces sueños.”
    </p>
<p>
     The florist walked out onto the dark street, waving at Agatha as she started to pull the store shutters down. Against her better judgement, she gave a short wave back, rolling her eyes as she saw a pleased grin grace Rio’s face before the night disappeared behind the metal slats.

<p>
      I hope this doesn't feel too OOC for either Rio or Agatha - I find it's harder to pin down their characters without the context of magic, but I hope I've done them justice. Definitely more Agathario to come in the next few chapters!

<em>
      31st October 2026
      <span>
</span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha loved Halloween and she wasn’t embarrassed to admit it. She, Teen, Alice and - begrudgingly - Jen, had spent the better part of Thursday evening decorating the tattoo parlour, giving the space a ghoulish makeover. Cobwebs hung in the windows and two pumpkins, carved by Agatha and Alice, guarded the door. Teen had draped purple and black cloths over the front desk and adorned it with some of Lilia’s more weird and wonderful items from the cafe, a crystal ball, tarot cards as well as large bowl of candy which sat on the side.
    </p>
<p>
     As for outfits, Agatha had a classic witch’s getup, a long purple dress complete with hat. The outfit was in two parts, the top half a corset piece that meant no long sleeves to get in the way of her work - if it also made her tits look great, then that was just a bonus - and a flowing skirt, paired with combat boots and hair secured in a low messy bun to allow for ideal hat placement.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Teen had arrived in a frankly incredible Maleficent costume that even had Agatha considering giving him a raise, while Alice had donned a 70s rock-chick look and added special effects makeup that gave it zombie apocalypse edge. Jen was less into the whole affair but had still made an effort of sorts, she wore one of her staple pink dresses but had added fairy wings and an intricate gold headband, with sparkly heels that put her almost a foot taller than Agatha.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Their efforts weren’t wasted either, as part of the festivities Agatha always designated Halloween a ‘flash day’, which was guaranteed to draw people in. Customers could choose from a selection of spooky - and not-so-spooky - designs that Agatha would refresh each Halloween (she had finally learnt from Teen that spooky season and Halloween were one and the same), and her and Alice would spend the day inking them onto all sorts of characters from young students to pensioners. This had been happening for over five years now and word had spread, with people from all over New Jersey and sometimes even further, coming in for a coveted Halloween tattoo. Another stipulation of the day was that Agatha and her team wouldn’t do the same design twice, this she had found, created a supply and demand type affair that had people queuing outside her shop front every October 31st without fail.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     This year was no different.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     It wasn’t until around four in the afternoon that Agatha had time to take her lunch break. She’d decided to make the journey to Lilia’s for a coffee and a sandwich and was sat down at the the bar chatting to the owner who stopped mid conversation to greet someone just out of Agatha’s view.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Now
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     is a costume.” Lilia gave a low whistle, directed towards the door. Intrigued, Agatha spun round in her seat to see what had the cafe owner so impressed and was met with the site of her neighbour come nemesis. Who was looking drop dead gorgeous, literally.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had on a black lace body suit that hugged her in all the right places, thigh highs and a long black cape - the hood of which was secured on her head with a black and silver crown of thorns. But it was her makeup that really drew Agatha in, face expertly painted as a skull with dark hollows that made her brown eyes almost black, and her sharp jaw accentuated by the shadows that mimicked the bone structure underneath.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Christ.” Was all Agatha could say, her brain not firing quickly enough to get out anything more coherent. She’d seen Rio around and about over the last two weeks, even to speak to once or twice. But she’d not been in her presence longer than a couple of minutes since the florist had come into the shop on her first week. She was therefore wildly unprepared to face her dressed as an incredibly sexy Lady Death.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     No, objectively good looking. Uh, not ugly. Fucking hot, whatever.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Her and Teen still plotted ways in which they might bring Rio down and halt her burgeoning flower business, but they’d never gotten further than the time they sent Jen in. That’s not to say Agatha still wasn’t annoyed by the woman’s presence and the constant flow of people in and out her doors, but she couldn’t seem to muster the energy to do anything about it - must be the early-onset winter blues, she reasoned.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     She was drawn out of her thoughts by Lilia who, much to Agatha’s embarrassment, said, “Darling, close your mouth or you’ll catch flies.”
    </p>
<p>
     A pink blush tinted her cheeks and she coughed awkwardly. Composing herself she looked back at the florist, dressed as Lady Death, who was less sinister with her usual smirk now plastered over her face. The woman continued her journey to the bar and hopped up on the seat next to Agatha.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Black coffee, half a sugar please Lilia. And one of those cute pumpkin cookies if you have them.” The coffee shop owner nodded in acknowledgement and busied herself with making the order.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Rio twisted her body towards Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s been really hard to focus today.” Rio’s tone had changed from jaunty, to something deeper. Agatha gave the woman a questioning look, both at the lack of greeting and seemingly out of context comment. Before she could say anything though, Rio continued. “Every time I finish serving a customer, I turn my head and there you are hard at work in that outfit with those arms and a face of concentration like nothing I’ve ever seen. Very distracting indeed, Agatha.” Agatha could feel death’s eyes tracing her torso, following the trail of tattoos across her upper body and down her arms.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     It gave her pause. Rio flirted with her whenever they were in the same vicinity, Agatha wasn’t blind to that, but this felt different. She looked up to meet the woman’s eyes and found a hunger in them that ignited something. Her skin felt hot under the florist’s gaze and she was almost pleased when eyes dipped down to her lips for a microsecond, before snapping back up again. Neither went to speak and just as she felt the silence had stretched on too long, Agatha was saved by Lilia plonking a coffee down between them. Thank god.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     The noise shook Rio out of whatever headspace she was in and her expression changed again, back to a warm smile that juxtaposed her grim reaper look.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha felt a sense of relief as Rio lapsed into conversation with Lilia, like she hadn’t been mere moments away from eye-fucking Agatha in the middle of the cafe. Another, smaller part of her felt a lingering sense of disappointment. She wondered what might have happened if Lilia hadn’t interrupted her - nothing, surely. They were in the middle of a public space for chrissakes, clearly she needed to get laid if she was entertaining thoughts of the florist in the middle of the day without a sip of alcohol.
    </p>
<p>
     She finished her coffee and sandwich, lost in her thoughts and paying little attention to the conversation happening next to her. Checking her watch and realising Alice would be pissed if she wasn’t back soon, Agatha put a few notes on the counter to cover the bill and attempted to shuffle off without alerting Rio and Lilia.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     She got up to leave but as she did so cold fingers grasped her wrist, holding it in place.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “I’m going to a Halloween party tonight and it would be criminal to waste that outfit on your customers. Come.” It was a command and Agatha hated to be told what to do. Well, she normally did but there was clearly something in the air as instead of saying no, what came out was: “When?”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “10pm, I’ll pick you up. Wear that.” She released Agatha’s wrist then and turned back to Lilia, who to her credit schooled her features despite the charged exchange going on in front of her.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha stood stock still for a moment, before coming back to herself. She grabbed her coat, flung it over her shoulders in a dramatic fashion and made a beeline for the door. Walking back to the shop she was able to think of little else than the invitation she had - agreed to? She reasoned that Rio was right, and it would be a waste to go home and drink wine on her sofa, alone. Maybe she’d even find a cute woman to take home and hopefully, banish the ridiculous notions she’d had in the coffee shop.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Yes, that’s the smart idea. She needn’t even speak to Rio at this party, she’d probably be off chatting to all her new best friends in Westview anyways.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     It was all going to be
     <em>

     .

     Rio had been wrapping a bouquet for a customer when her phone pinged.

<p>
</p>
<p>
     She threw the rest of the bouquet together and almost shoved it into the customer’s hands.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Thanks so much, Happy Halloween. Now, apologies I’ve just realised I have a delivery that needs collecting, have a nice day, bye.” Rio ushered the customer out of the door, closing it behind them both and locking up.

     “You’re going to wear a hole in the carpet if you don’t cut that out.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Rio didn’t normally get nervous, but this evening she was a bundle of pent up energy, pacing up and down her living room with a bottle of beer in hand as Alice watched on in amusement. It was less than half an hour until the time she said she’d pick Agatha up, and she was worried she wouldn’t show. As if reading her thoughts, Alice continued.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “There’s no chance Agatha would miss this. Firstly, she is like
     <em>
      obsessed
     </em>
     with Halloween and we had a great day at the shop so she’ll be in one of her over-the-top, good moods. Secondly, she may try to hide it - poorly, I might add - but she definitely likes you. And thirdly, you look
     <em>
      hot
     </em>
     , I defy anyone to stand up Lady Death herself.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave her a half smile, half grimace - at least that’s what it looked like, it was hard to tell behind all the makeup.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “I don’t know Alice, she seems to find me irksome at best and ignores me at worse. I think she only said yes in the first place to be polite.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Look man, I’ve known Agatha a while now and she’s many, many things but polite is not one of them. Believe me, if she really didn’t like you you’d know about it. She just gets all weird and territorial about her shop and the sanctity of the Witches’ Road and all that jazz. I mean, that place is her whole life, she inherited it when her mother died just after she left college and has watched the entire road evolve since then.” Rio’s expression softened at this.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Oh yes, I remember Sharon saying the place had been in the family a long time. It’s sweet, that she’s keeping her mother’s memory alive like that.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Pffft. You’re fucking joking - no, when that shop belonged to Evanora Harkness it was some kind of Christian book store. Agatha’s mum
     <em>
      hated
     </em>
     her tattoos and would be turning in her grave if she found out what she’d done to the place. No, Agatha’s so possessive of her shop in spite of her mother, she couldn’t bear to see something she’s worked so hard for become some hipster bar.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio let out a low chuckle. She hadn’t known Agatha long, and they’d had little chance to interact in the month she’d been here, but it sounded like they were cut from the same cloth. Rio did get on with her parents, but they never had much in common, even when she was a child. It was why she’d spent so much time with Sharon on those long summer afternoons, and during the holidays. Perhaps their relationship hadn’t been as strained as Agatha and her mother’s, but Rio could relate to that feeling of pride for going out on your own and making something of yourself - even in the face of adversity.
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, I don’t blame her really. If I was in that position I’d feel the same way, behave worse even.”
    </p>
<p>
     “God,” Alice rolled her eyes, “you guys really are perfect for each other.” Rio blushed slightly at this, halting her pacing to sit down on the arm of Alice’s chair.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Well, whatever happens tonight you’re right, I look hot and I’m going to dance my arse off - and if Agatha wants to join me, then even better.” Getting some pep back in her step, she knocked her beer bottle hard on the top of Alice’s causing it to fizz up and over the younger woman.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice swore and jumped up, as Rio fell about cackling, pleased with herself.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Incredible. I’ve become friends with someone who has the humour of a teenage boy.” Despite her tone, Alice cracked a smile before starting to laugh herself, using Rio’s fancy-looking throw to wipe down her pants as payback. “Now hurry up you monster, you don’t want to keep the lady waiting.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      31st October - 21:59
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio let out a breath she didn’t know she’d been holding as she spotted Agatha standing outside her own shop. She wore a long wool coat over her costume and had let her hair out of its bun, adding to the look. The tattoo artist had also donned some jewellery and in her left hand - heavy with rings - she carried a bottle of booze.
    </p>
<p>
     She met Rio’s gaze across the street and the florist gave her a slightly too enthusiastic wave before crossing.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Hey stranger, Happy Halloween.” She took Agatha’s free hand and dipped into a half bow, kissing her knuckles on the way back up. Incidentally, Rio spotted that each knuckle had a letter on it.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     S.A.N.D
    </p>
<p>
     She lifted the woman’s palm up to her face to inspect it more closely, noticing Agatha’s expression shift with something akin to embarrassment.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “You must really love the beach, huh?”
    </p>
<p>
     “How about, you look lovely Agatha, how was your day Agatha? Can I lead you to this party where you can get a stiff drink, Agatha.” She moved to snatch her hand away, but was beaten by Rio who tugged her arm back down and looped her own through so they could walk down the street together.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Apologies
     <em>
      darling
     </em>
     , how rude of me. Did you have a lovely day, day dream of the beach in your spare time?” Agatha whacked her arm with the bottle and chose to ignore her comment.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Tell me Rio, where are we going this evening? There better be good music and beers.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Oh just you wait my love.”

<p>
     “You know, you’re not a very good death. My love this, my darling that. Do try and stay in character,
     <em>
      dear.
     </em>
     ”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Mmmm didn’t know you were into role play, noted.” This earned the florist another whack on the arm with the bottle but even as it stung her arm she couldn’t help but grin.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     They arrived at the party not long after, trading barbs en route before falling into a comfortable silence. That was broken once they arrived at the large house at the end of the cul-de-sac in one of Westview’s nicer boroughs, where music was blearing through the speakers and people in all sorts of extravagant outfits were milling about the front garden.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Rio Vidal, do you not think we’re a little old for a frat party?”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha was ready to let off some steam that evening, but to do so in the presence of under 25s was very far from her idea of fun.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Oh no, don’t you worry. No frat boys here, or, at least none that would have been in a frat house after 1980.” She pulled Agatha by the hand through throngs of people - who admittedly, did look to be around her age - and into the house.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     The older woman stared in awe at the decorations which covered the hallway Rio was currently dragging her through. Spiders and ghosts hung from the ceiling and intricate garlands of black tinsel wound their way up the bannisters of the grand staircase.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Finally, they found themselves in the kitchen, but before Agatha could pour herself a drink and think about how she might make her great escape from the flower shop owner - she heard said owner’s name being called across the room.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Rio. I’m so pleased you’re here, and look, you’ve brought a friend too. How wonderful.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     The woman who approached them was not what Agatha had been expecting from the wild looking party that raged on around them. She was familiar, almost grandmotherly, in a way that should put you at ease. She was dressed as an angel, in the sense that she wore a white dress and halo, but had clearly opted for comfort over style with a sensible shoe and winter jumper.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Agatha, this is Sharon. Sharon, Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh my,” the woman’s voice was pitched in a way that put Agatha’s teeth on edge, but she tried not to grimace. “Aren’t you a pretty one, Agatha. And how do you know my Rio?” Her Rio, interesting.
    </p>
<p>
     “She runs the store opposite me, I told you about her remember.” Rio butted in, clearly conscious that this
     <em>
      Sharon
     </em>
     liked to chat.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Oh of course, Lilia’s friend.” The way she said Lilia made Agatha think there may be some history there, a sharper inflection to the woman’s already nasal voice. “Well Agatha, I hope you treat my Rio right, she’s a smart girl and…” Rio cut the woman off again.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “It’s not like that, Sharon. Agatha is my neighbour and, uh”, she paused weighing up whether you could class someone who you’d only spoken few times, and who mostly spoke to you with contempt, as a friend. Before she could decide however, Agatha took matters into her own hands.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Well, Sandra.” She grasped the older woman’s hand. “It was
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     lovely to meet you, but I’ve just spotted someone I know. Must dash, don’t want to seem rude.” With that, she gave Rio a tap on the shoulder, and waved at both women before disappearing into the crowd with a bottle of something dark.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     God, Rio loved Sharon but she couldn’t half be a pain in her backside.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     It was almost an hour later before Rio found Agatha again. She’d been waylaid by various friends’ of Sharons and by Westview residents who had begun to frequent her flower shop. At one point, she’s even bumped in to Jen, who she was sure Agatha did not know was here, and who looked well on her way to being rat-arsed. Good for her, Rio thought.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     When she finally found the tattoo artist, she was in the pool house, doing shots off a floaty with two men who looked to be around Rio’s age and whose couples costume appeared to be something that would need a five minuted back story and a Twitter account to explain. She drifted over to the group, watching intently as Agatha picked up the shot with her teeth and tossed her head back, neck straining as she let the liquid flow down her throat. As she spat the glass back out the older woman locked eyes with Rio, face shifting into something that could be described as sultry.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Well if it isn’t Lady Death herself. Having a good night
     <em>
      sweetheart?
     </em>
     ” Agatha drew out the last word in the same way Rio had been doing with her pet names on the way to the party.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Mmm, not as good as you it seems.” Agatha wasn’t quite drunk, but she was certainly merrier than when Rio had last seen her and she was more than a little jealous of the fun she’d been having without her.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Well we’ll have to change that, won’t we.” Without even a nod goodbye to her new friends, Agatha grabbed Rio’s hand and pulled her out of the pool house and towards the makeshift dance floor in the marquee outside. The DJ Sharon had organised was playing a drum and bass remix of something that had been popular back when Rio still went clubbing, and she laughed as Agatha began to bop along to the beat.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     One song flowed into another and another as the two women danced together, pulling ridiculous moves and throwing themselves around until they were out of breath. As a particularly heavy song came to a close Agatha leant in towards Rio so she could be heard over the beat.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “That was fun, but I’m getting far too old for this. Want to go outside and cool off?” Rio just nodded, unable to come up with a reply with the older woman’s lips practically touching the shell of her ear. Once again grabbing her hand, Agatha led them out into the cool night air and over to a bench at the bottom of Sharon’s garden, near the well-kept borders.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Christ, I haven’t danced like that for years.” Agatha’s breath was short with laughter and exertion. “It was good fun though, thanks.” The look she gave Rio was different than usual, it was more genuine and even seemed a little fond. Rio smiled back.
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m glad you’ve had a good night.” Pause. “Agatha, I uh, I wanted to ask if,” Rio looked down at Agatha’s hands, psyching herself up, when something caught her eye.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     The sound that came out of her mouth could only be described as a guffaw. She grabbed both Agatha’s hands and held them together.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, do your knuckles say
     <em>
      sandwich
     </em>
     ?” At this she let out a full belly laugh, even as Agatha gave her a fierce look. “Oh, this is priceless.” She was laughing so hard now that tears started to form in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     “I lost a bet alright. Hey. Stop laughing, it’s not that funny.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Will you give me knuckle sandwich if I don’t stop.” Agatha’s look grew even more furious which only made Rio laugh harder.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Please do shut up.” Agatha’s low voice and hard stare saw Rio’s laugher subside somewhat, but the humour was still there in her eyes. She moved closer into the tattoo artist’s space.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why don’t you make me.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     They were almost nose to nose now, and Agatha was completely unsure of how that’d happened. She could still feel the cold grip of Rio’s hands around hers, thumbs brushing her knuckles, and the warmth of her breath on her cheeks.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Everything seemed to still for a moment, before Agatha crashed her lips against the younger woman’s who met her with the same intensity almost instantly. Her hands wandered out of Rio’s grip and up to clasp her face, still painted in that beautiful, eerie skull. Rio pulled her bottom lip between her teeth and sunk her teeth into it, which caused Agatha to let out an involuntary moan. They continued like that for what seemed like hours, but in reality could only have been a few minutes, before breaking apart for much needed air.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha rested her forehead against Rio’s, unsure of what to do or say next. Luckily Rio made that decision for them.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Well,” she panted, still breathless from their impromptu make out session, “that was much better than a knuckle sandwich.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha couldn’t help but let out a laugh, both at the absurdity of the moment and Rio’s ability to put her at ease with the most insane lines.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Well, it did shut you up, for a few minutes at least.” She moved her forehead away but stayed sat facing the florist on the bench. “Hey. Before that whole,” Agatha paused, trying to put into words the last fifteen minutes, “thing. You were going to ask me something, what was it?”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Food.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “What?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Food, do you want to get some. With me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Right now?”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Right now, or, you know, this week. At a restaurant, maybe?”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “I’ll think about it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ll think about it?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Mmhmm. You did make fun of my tattoos after all, don’t think I’ve forgotten.” The smirk on her face betrayed the seriousness of her voice, but Rio was happy to play the game.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Well, will you let me know what you decide.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Give me your phone number, and I will.” Agatha thrust her phone toward the woman, not even waiting for an answer. Not that she needed to, if the speed with which Rio input her contact details was anything to go by.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha grabbed the phone back off her and got to her feet. She grasped Rio’s chin, tilting her head to the side to kiss her on the jaw and avoid smudging (anymore) of her makeup.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “I’ll call you.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     With that she swept off towards the house, leaving Rio sat on the bench, stupid smirk on her face again and crown askew.

      5th November 2026
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Dappled winter light filtered through the blinds in Rio’s kitchen, bringing a warmth to the room despite the temperature reaching below zero the previous night. Rio, still half asleep, went through the motions of her morning routine, watering the plants that were dotted around her kitchen and living space. Since moving in, her apartment had taken on a greenhouse quality - as anywhere she stayed long enough was wont to do - and she made a mental checklist of what needed tending to and when. Once she was sure everything was in order, the florist returned to her room, throwing on her least dirty cargo pants and a wife beater, with a thick army-style coat and beanie to keep her warm.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Today Rio was planning to go a local grower that Sharon had put her on to. They were based a couple of hours outside of Westview and it would be the first time since moving to the small town that Rio had left its confines. She was looking forward to the trip, but it would mean she’d have to close the shop for the day which wasn’t ideal. Alice had kindly offered up her and Teen’s help, though Rio wasn’t sure the latter had much say, but she turned them down not wanting to risk the wrath of taking half Agatha’s workforce out of commission for the day.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Speak of the devil.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Rio’s phone dinged and she scrolled to the top of her notifications.

</p>
<p>
     Rio chuckled. She and Agatha had been texting on and off since Halloween, and though she’d yet to pin the tattoo artist down for an actual date, their relationship had shifted from charged but borderline hostile to something lighter. They exchanged stories of customers with terrible taste (Agatha) and those who were overly friendly and enthusiastic (Rio), as well as easy banter and on one occasion gifs - Rio felt Teen may have offered guidance in the last instance. Sometimes, Agatha even seemed to care about what Rio was doing. She never went as far as to outright ask how her day was, but probing questions to her whereabouts and the odd coffee delivered to her workplace suggested she wasn’t completely immune to Rio’s charms.

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She didn’t have time to wait for a response, already running behind if she was going to miss the commuter traffic.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was rooting around in the drawers of her desk in the shop, having realised she’s left her van keys down there last night, when she heard a tap on the window. Jumping out from behind the counter ready to tell whoever it was that had forgotten an anniversary where to stick it, she
     <span>
</span>
     was surprised to see her neighbour stood outside in her leather jacket was clearly no match for the bitter morning.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha clutched two cups of coffee and gave her an awkward smile through the window. Inordinately please with the turn her morning was taking, Rio sidled over to the door and beckoned the other woman inside - rush for van keys momentarily forgotten.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Hey stranger, fancy seeing you here. One of those for me?” Agatha gave a half grunt in response, though she looked pleased that her gift was well received.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Why then I must thank you, for I have almost a days ride ahead of me and I shall need all the strength I can get. Perhaps too, a kiss goodbye from the beautiful maiden, should I not make it back?” Rio continued, grabbing the coffee from Agatha’s hand before kissing it.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “You’re so fucking weird, you know that right.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Mmmhmm. You love it.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Yes, well.” Agatha coughed before continuing. “I thought you might need something to get you through what I can only imagine will be a morning on the road with some of the lowest IQs in New Jersey, so you’re welcome.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Rio squeezed Agatha’s hand in a true show of thanks, before taking a sip of coffee. Which she almost immediately spat out.
    </p>
<p>
     “Christ woman, I don’t mean to be rude. I appreciate the gesture, truly. But what the fuck is in that?”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Oh my mistake. That must be mine.” Agatha smirked before switching the two cups. “Here you go doll.” Rio was soothed by a sip of the correct coffee but looked at Agatha like she had three heads when she took a gulp of her own.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Honestly though Agatha, we’re
     <em>
      friends
     </em>
     right?”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “I guess.” The older woman’s cheeks coloured slightly at the emphasis Rio put on the word friends.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Then please, tell me what went wrong in your youth to make you turn to an abomination like that at 8am on a Thursday morning?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha let out a low chuckle and raised her eyebrows.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “A story for another time I think. Now should you not be getting on the road, don’t let me take up any more of your precious time. Word on the street is you have dahlias to acquire.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “You’re right I suppose.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m always right.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “How about Saturday, 7 o’clock.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Come again?
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “This Saturday, if you’re free. Why don’t I take you to dinner and you can tell me all about your villain origin story that led you to such a heinous coffee order.” Agatha seemed to consider her words for a moment.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Fine, but I’ll pick the venue. I don’t need you taking me to one of these flat iron places run by twenty year olds on the bankroll of mummy and daddy.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Rio seemed completely unperturbed by Agatha’s date hijacking.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “I look forward to seeing what hidden gem Westview has to offer then.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled haughtily and before she turned on her heel to leave, dipped down and gave Rio a light peck on the cheeks.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Ciao, Rio.” With a short wave she was gone, back across the road to prepare for her first client of the day.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Rio smiled down at her coffee for a few moments, before realising she was now running far behind her self-imposed schedule. Fuck it, worth it.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     The florist’s smile didn’t leave her face, even as she joined the I-95, cussing out drivers the rest of the way to her destination.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      7th November 2026 - Saturday
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Lilia, please leave Señor Scratchy be and come make yourself useful.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha had been more on edge than usual for the past couple of days, anticipation building for her so-called ‘date’ with Rio. It wasn’t that she was nervous per se, but there was something about the idea of meeting the woman outside the context of work or parties that made her feel - unsettled. This had manifested itself in her inviting Lilia over late Saturday afternoon for a glass of wine and to help her decide on an outfit.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha had been on many dates with many women and the fact that this had dried up somewhat since the early naughties was of little relevance. However, for some reason when she thought about going out with Rio she wanted to impress beyond just donning her usual work look pimped up with some jewellery and a lick of makeup.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     This was how she found herself with clothes strewn across her bed, wine glass in hand, calling for Lilia to come save her - either from her clothing crisis, or from the grip on reality she was surely losing.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Agatha, I was only next door, must you bellow like a child?” Only further making the cafe owner’s point, Agatha pouted and waved her arm at the clothes strewn about.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “I need you to help me find something that’s hot Lilia. Like, I want you to want to rip my clothes off, but in a classy way? Do you know what I mean.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’d say you’ve changed your tune, but I can’t pretend I didn’t see this coming a mile off. That being said, I really think you’re overthinking this dear, it’s obvious Rio likes you and I’m loath to say it aloud but I think you could be wearing a bin bag and she’d want to rip it off. Respectfully.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked a little smug at this. Lilia was what Teen liked to call a ‘hype man’. She was always there to ease your worries and offer you a motivational speech, compliment, or insult someone else as needed. For that Agatha was grateful, especially in moments like this where the self doubt crept in. Indeed, reinvigorated by the other woman’s comments, she went back to the pile of clothing and picked out a pair of dark green, velvet suit trousers and a matching waistcoat and tuxedo jacket.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     She paired the outfit with heeled boots, some gold rings and chains and her hair down. Lilia gave a low whistle when she came to present the final look to her and Señor Scratchy.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “You look knock out kid, now go get your girl. I’ll clear up and feed the bunny, you have a great night.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha thanked the woman, giving her a fond smile and shoulder squeeze before grabbing her back and heading out the door. She’d agreed to meet Rio outside the flower shop before heading to the restaurant.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She turned as the door to Rio’s flat opened and the florist made her way over to Agatha, a bouquet in hand. Rio looked incredible. Her dark hair was sleek and bouncy and she wore a long black dress with a daring neckline, a thin gold chain sat on her collarbones. The florist’s lips were painted a dark red and she ghosted them over Agatha’s cheek - not wanting to leave a mark - as she passed her the bouquet.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “You look beautiful, cariño.”
    </p>
<p>
     “As do you darling and thank you for the flowers, they’re gorgeous.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blushed at the pet name and compliment, taking the arm offered by the tattoo artist. She brushed a thumb over her knuckles as the older woman led them down the Witches’ Road, professing their destination wasn’t far.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Luckily for Rio’s feet, which were being slowly mangled by a pair of lovely heeled pumps one size too small, she hadn’t been lying and soon they turned down a small alleyway to approach what must be a restaurant, hidden away at the end. Agatha knocked twice and the door was opened by a young man that must’ve been no older than Teen. He smiled at the two women and led them through to a small but lively dining room, bathed in a warm light from tables covered in candles and the low lamps mounted on walls. The boy brought them to a table in a more intimate corner of the restaurant and seated them.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “I’ll come back in a few minutes to take your drinks orders, but don’t hesitate to let me know if you need anything.” With this he left the two woman alone, sat in comfortable silence.
    </p>
<p>
     “So,” Rio began, “this is a pretty fancy place, huh. Do you take all your new neighbours here, looking like that?” Her tone was playful, but Agatha could also detect a hint of something more in her voice that she liked the sound of.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Well, it’s only fair that I bring you somewhere you can experience the true Witches’ Road. You won’t find a kale smoothie in sight here, I can promise you that.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Why do you do that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Do what?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Bring everything back to how much you hate the Witches’ Road. Don’t get me wrong, I know Jane, and Herb and Dottie - I could keep going - aren’t the easiest to stomach, but surely if you only have to interact with them a few times a week they’re not so bad?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Pft, yeah right. Those guys are total schmucks and they’ve completely ruined what used to be a respectable street.” Agatha looked down away from Rio and studied the menu far to intensely to actually be taking any of it in.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Look you talk a big game Agatha, but there must be something more there right?”
    </p>
<p>
     “It’s none of your business.” She continued not to look at Rio, beckoning the waiter over.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Hey, hey Agatha, I don’t want to start this night off on a bad foot. I was just genuinely curious is all. We don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed and tilted her head back to Rio, meeting the younger woman’s eyes.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to be such a bitch it just comes naturally to me.” Rio chuckled, bringing some levity back into the conversation. “It’s just that I’ve spent my whole life on this road, I’ve seen people come and go, some of them terrible some of them less so. But it just makes me so mad that people have lost all respect for what this place used to be, used to stand for, you know?”
    </p>
<p>
     “And what’s that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I can’t put it into words, not really, but it’s just that idea that to them this is all just money. There’s no passion, no love for their craft or for their jobs, it’s all just a means to lure in punters and sell them non-FDA approved shite and then have them swill it down with a craft beer that’s labeled as local but imported from fucking Canada.” Agatha was almost breathless at the end of her short rant and had been paying little attention to Rio, who, now she glanced at her, had a look in her eye like she might devour her there and then.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Agatha Harkness, here I was thinking you were just a miserable old crone.” The tattoo artist let out a sound of protest. “But, you are just full of surprises.” Rio’s voice had dipped to a lower register and her gaze dropped from the bridge of her nose, to settle on the woman’s lips.
    </p>
<p>
     They lapsed back into silence for a moment, the air around them charged with something not quite appropriate for the setting. Before they could say anything else though, the moment was broken by the waiter returning to take their drinks order.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     The evening continued in a much lighter way after that, though there was still an underlying energy as the two women drank, chatted and ate their meal.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     They were going halves on a tiramisu when Agatha felt the pointed tip of Rio’s shoe nudging her ankle.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “What do you think you’re doing.” The older woman lent across the table to ensure she wasn’t overheard by the surrounding patrons.
    </p>
<p>
     “Tell me to stop if you want.” Agatha felt the lack of contact as Rio pulled her foot away, back to her side of the table. Agatha, still close, pinned her wrist to the table for leverage as she leaned even closer to the other woman’s ear.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “I didn’t say that.” At the confirmation, Rio’s foot returned to its previous position, before travelling north up the outside of Agatha’s trouser leg towards her lap. “Jesus Christ,” the older woman’s voice was toeing the line of exasperated and turned on, “waiter, the cheque. Please.” She struggled to get the last part of her sentence out as Rio’s foot reached its destination.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha settled the bill in record time and almost flew from her seat, grabbing Rio’s coat and holding it out for her before almost dragging the florist towards the door. As soon as they were outside Agatha pinned the younger woman up against the brick of the alleyway, barely an inch separated their lips.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “You’ve been driving my crazy since the moment you got here, you know that, right?” Rio only gave her a signature smirk at the admission before pulling Agatha by the lapels of her jacket into a bruising kiss. They stayed like that for longer than either could keep track of, Agatha’s bouquet lying to the side, forgotten for a moment. It was only when a server came out for a smoke and coughed awkwardly that they were forced to break apart.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Come home with me?” Rio breathed into Agatha’s ear, voice laced with hopefulness and need. The older woman nodded, grabbing Rio’s hand and the bouquet and leading them back towards the flower shop. The journey back, up Rio’s stairs and into her flat was a blur, and neither woman cared for the mess of clothes and items that mapped their journey across the small apartment.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha had planned to go home after, she really did. But Rio’s offer of a baggy old sorority t-shirt and hot tea before bed was too enticing, she was sore - in the best possible way - and it was a Sunday tomorrow after all. If the woman wrapped round her middle was a contributing factor then that was nobody’s business but her own. She was drifting off to sleep when Rio mumbled something that resembled a goodnight into her neck.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     She craned her head up just enough to meet the florist’s sleepy gaze.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Goodnight weirdo, sleep well.”

<em>
      23rd November 2026
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     It had been a couple of weeks since Agatha’s first date with Rio and things were going well, which Teen and the rest of her employees were being unbearably smug about. At first, she’d tried to hide the blossoming relationship from the ragtag crew - well, from Teen and Jen at least as it was clear as glass after about a week of dating that Alice and Rio were in cahoots.
    </p>
<p>
     Unfortunately, her plans had been foiled around the middle of their second week of seeing each other, when she had an unfortunate encounter with Jen after leaving Rio’s apartment in the early hours of the morning.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      17th November 2026
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Agatha had thrown on an old band shirt of Rio’s that reached her mid-thigh and wrapped herself in the long winter coat she’d worn out that night, ready to make a mad dash to her own flat. They hadn’t meant to stay out as long as they did and Agatha was anxious to avoid any probing questions from her employees about why she was wearing the same outfit two days in a row.
      <span>
</span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Unfortunately, the gods had other plans for her as no sooner had she eased Rio’s front door to the street closed than she spotted movement in the window of her own shopfront - despite it barely being past dawn. The woman rued the day she ever gave keys to the rest of the team.
     </em>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      She racked her brains on how she might get to her own flat now - which was only accessible through the back of the shop - without alerting whoever was inside. It’s not like she could go back up to Rio’s, the door now locked and the woman almost certainly dead to the world.
      <span>
</span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Drawing a blank, Agatha bit the bullet and crossed the road to the front of the shop. The bell above the door alerted the occupant to her presence before she’d even crossed the threshold.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “Who’s there? I’ve got a weapon and I won’t hesitate to use it.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Jesus Christ. Jen, excellent - it couldn’t have been Alice, that would be too easy and Agatha’s karma had never been great.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “Jen. If you attack me with a piercing gun I swear on my mother’s grave I will sack you.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      There was a short silence before the woman in question appeared from one of the back rooms.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      As if I would allow a piercing gun in my sacred work space you absolute psychopa…” The taller woman trailed off as she took in Agatha’s appearance. “Sorry, where in god’s name have you been? What the fuck are you wearing, are you not wearing any pants?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Agatha pulled her coat around herself, though didn’t look the least bit embarrassed.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      What the fuck are you doing here in the middle of the night?” The tattoo artist spat back.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      Don’t avoid the question. Have you been at a grown up sleepover?” Jen raised her eyebrows, looking every bit as smug as she presumably felt.
      <span>
</span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “Don’t fucking call it that I’m not twelve.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      So you don’t deny it? Come on then, spill, who is she? Has to be someone who lives on the Road if you felt that was an appropriate outfit to leave the house in.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      I’m not entertaining this and you haven’t answered my question of why you’re here at the arse-crack of dawn.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “Firstly, Agatha, it’s six thirty in the morning which isn’t a particularly unreasonable time. And I’m here because I’ve got to sort out some orders out before my first customer comes in, which will be eight o’clock because Teen was too busy scrolling on his godd
     </em>
     amn
     <em>
      phone to realise the booking system was messed up.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Was that true? Whoops, Agatha may have been paying slightly less attention than normal recently. Perhaps she better check in today that there were no other fires in need of putting out - useless bloody team.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “Now,” Jen continued. “Please tell me you haven’t started sleeping with Dottie, or no, don’t tell me, D’Arcy? Actually, she’s cute, but too good for you.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      Hey!”
      <span>
</span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “Right, definitely not D’Arcy then. God. Not Jane?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “Jesus Jen what’s wrong with you? No, I’ve not been sleeping with half
      <span>
</span>
      Westview’s PTA. Can we just drop it please, I need to go upstairs and get myself a bucket of coffee before dealing with the rest of you fuckers.” The shorter woman pushed her way past Jen, removing her coat and throwing it across the arm of the sofa as she went to go upstairs.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Before she could go any further though, Jen grabbed her shoulder and spun her back round so they were face to face.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “I know that t-shirt.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “It’s a very common band.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      Rio was wearing that the other day to unload a bunch of shrubs from her van.” A brief pause and then what could only be described as a shit-eating grin spread across Jen’s face. “No fucking way, you’re sleeping with Rio? Oh this is just priceless.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      A blush bloomed across Agatha’s cheeks though she fought to fight it down. This was just her bloody luck, she wished she’d given into Rio’s pleas this morning to stay in bed and call in sick.
      <span>
</span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      Like I said, it’s a very common shirt. Rio must have the same one, she seems basic like that.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      “Oh nice try. You’re fooling no one babes. Just wait until I tell the girls about this.” The girls were, according to Jen, anyone she’d ever had more than a 5-minute
     </em>
<em>
      conversation with and that included Teen. The boy was going to give her absolute hell.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      If you tell anyone about this Jen, I will have you dealt with. Mark my words.” Unfortunately, Agatha’s normally threatening aura was somewhat sullied by said t-shirt and her lack of pants. Jen merely laughed in her face.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      See you in a few hours, lover boy.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Present - 23rd November 2026
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     So, there it was. By lunchtime that day everyone and their mother knew Agatha and Rio were an item. Rio, unsurprisingly, was delighted with this turn of events, and though Agatha spent the better half of the day brooding in her studio, she had to admit she didn’t hate the idea of people knowing about them.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Since then, the two had spent even more time together, going for lunches and dinners and yes, adult sleepovers. Vomit.
    </p>
<p>
     In fact, if she was being brutally honest with herself, it was the healthiest relationship Agatha had had in some time. Sure she and the florist bickered and occasionally full on argued, but in the almost month that they’d been seeing each other Agatha hadn’t felt that usual gnawing in the pit of her stomach, urging her to cut and run before she could get too close.
    </p>
<p>
     She’d also been in a better mood than usual lately - something that Teen had commented on a number of times. She occasionally caught herself in the glass of the store front and was aghast to see she was smiling without even realising it.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Nevertheless, the short, normally borderline-aggressive woman was content with the way things were going. Indeed she was at that very moment on her way back from Lilia’s to deliver Rio a coffee and sandwich and hopefully stay for a while to watch her work. Work, currently, was planting some small Christmas trees in the borders behind the shop - something that involved a pleasing amount of arm on show.
    </p>
<p>
     However, before she could make her way round back she was interrupted by the buzz of her phone.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn’t bother to check the contact before picking up.
    </p>
<p>
     “Harkness.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Agatha, you always sound so angry darling.” Agatha’s blood ran cold, she knew that voice and it was not someone she wanted to speak to. Now or ever again.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wanda, I thought I told you to delete this number. Oh it’s just like you to be so bloody obstinate. Why the fuck are you calling me?”
    </p>
<p>
     “See, so aggressive. Not even a hello Wanda? How have you been, how’s Canada been treating you? Not well, by the way, it’s really flipping cold in the winter.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You can still talk the hind legs off a donkey then?”
    </p>
<p>
     She could imagine the woman’s smile through the phone. Constantly amused by Agatha’s well, Agatha-isms.
    </p>
<p>
     “Anyway. I’m calling because I’m in Westview.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nearly dropped the bag with Rio’s coffee and sandwich, such was her surprise.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re fucking what. What the hell are you doing here Wanda?” The other woman gritted out.
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t worry, it’s only a flying visit. My lawyer needed me to come and sign some documents in person, and I was planning on going to Europe for Christmas anyways so it makes sense to stop off en-route.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Westview, and I cannot stress this enough, is not en-route to Sokovia and you jolly well know that.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     The woman on the other end of the line just chuckled and proceeded to witter on for another couple of minutes about her Christmas plans, and business in Westview until Agatha had to cut in.
    </p>
<p>
     “Look. Is there a reason you’re calling me after I explicitly told you to never contact me again.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh Agatha, I knew you didn’t really mean it. We are still best friends after all.”
    </p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      Ex
     </em>
     -best friends.” The tattoo artist cut in, and was promptly ignored.
    </p>
<p>
     “I thought it was obvious. Since I’m in town I thought we could meet up, go for coffee? I’ll even let you order that absolutely viscous concoction you insist on getting.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Pass.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha, come onnnnn. It’s been what, three years?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Best three years of my life.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t be such a misery, how about tomorrow afternoon? Three o’clock? I’ll come by the shop.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “No, Wanda…” But it was too late, the woman had put the phone down and Agatha, knowing how stubborn she was, also knew she’d be outside the shop tomorrow afternoon at three on the dot.
    </p>
<p>
     The rest of the day went by in a blur, she delivered Rio her lunch which led to an impromptu make out session and Agatha returning to the shop with more than a few twigs in her unruly hair. Something Jen had a lot to say about.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     The evening lapsed into night into day again, and before she knew it three o’clock had rolled round.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      24th November 2026
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “Who’s that?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Whose who?” Alice looked up from her salad bowl, which she was eating perched on a stool behind Rio’s till.
    </p>
<p>
     “The redhead throwing herself at my g-, at Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice’s head snapped up. The chances were so so slim, but she couldn’t help wonder whether…
    </p>
<p>
     “Shit, no way!” The Asian woman let out a surprised laugh. “No fucking way.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “What do you mean ‘no way’, Alice who is that dude, come onnnn.”
    </p>
<p>
     Alice seemed not to hear her, a laser focus on the two, trying to lip read or at least get some idea of what was being said. It was clear that the redhead. Wanda. Actual Wanda Maximoff. Was in a much better mood than the tattoo artist, who looked just shy of murderous now that she’d freed herself from the other woman’s embrace.
    </p>
<p>
     “Alice!”
    </p>
<p>
     This shook Alice back to the present.
    </p>
<p>
     “Jesus Rio, no need to shout. That woman throwing herself at Agatha is Wanda Maximoff.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And, should that mean something to me? She famous?”
    </p>
<p>
     “What, no. Oh of course, you don’t know the lore.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s face, which was already twisted into a forced smile that - from some angles - might’ve been considered murderous, darkened.
    </p>
<p>
     “And what lore is that? Looks like they’re pretty close.” It was true that while Agatha had initially looked like she might bite Wanda’s head off, her gaze had started to soften as the woman spoke, hand on the shorter woman’s shoulder and the other making vague gestures.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice was again distracted by this turn of events, so many questions running through her mind. It had been years since Wanda had lived in Westview, and things had ended on not so great terms, with Agatha dyeing the Sokovian woman’s dog - Sparky, was it - purple after they’d fallen out over some books, of all things.
    </p>
<p>
     It had all started when the tattoo artist had borrowed some first editions from Wanda’s bookshop, promising to take good care of them before promptly losing one and setting fire to the other - something they never did get to the bottom of. This started a chain reaction and the former best friends went from being attached at the hip to barely speaking in less than a month. It all culminated in the the dog-dye incident - a story that had become so outlandish, no one apart from Alice, Agatha, Lila and Wanda ever knew what actually happened.
    </p>
<p>
     What did happen, incidentally, was that Wanda decided to move to Canada. Her friendship with Agatha was already fraught and she’d been offered a research position out at a university in Toronto, one too good to pass up. Agatha, having taken their month long argument in stride - assuming it to be even a fun new layer to their friendship - was aghast when the Sokovian woman broke the news. She’d had very few true friends in her life, a statement Alice and Lilia had been mildly offended by at the time but chose to overlook, and she channeled her feelings of being abandoned into her own brand of self preservation. That, ultimately, manifested itself in the dyeing Sparky her purple - perhaps, a way to mark her own territory.

<p>
     The whole thing had taken a toll on the small corner of Westview involved in the feud, and had eventually made its way into mainstream gossip. In some stories, Agatha had suddenly turned on Wanda, unprompted, reverting to her usual hatred of the people of the Witches’ Road - their initial friendship, merely a part of her wider plans. In others, she was a jilted  lover and in one particularly bizarre account, she’d even been accused of bedding Wanda’s husband. Because Wanda was married, happily so, for over 10 years now.
    </p>
<p>
     This was something Alice felt, in hindsight, it may have been helpful to tell Rio. Unfortunately, the woman had already left her perch behind the counter and was now making a beeline for the two women outside Agatha’s tattoo parlour.
    </p>
<p>
     Oh dear, this was going to be good.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha was loath to admit it, but she’d missed the redhead the teeniest tiniest bit. She’d never, ever, say it aloud, but there was something soothing about her voice, accented with remnants from her own country, that was soothing.
    </p>
<p>
     They’d not yet made it further than the outside Agatha’s shop, so caught up in a story Wanda was recounting of Vision, who had recently gotten a job as an engineer and accidentally caused a company-wide blackout in his second week there.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha was laughing as the younger woman started gesturing - a crude impression of her husband’s reaction - when she spotted Rio out the corner of her eye.
    </p>
<p>
     Distracted by the florist, who looked equally stunning and furious, she didn’t catch the petering out of Wanda’s voice as her focus too shifted to the woman approaching them.
    </p>
<p>
     Before she could say anything, Rio had sidled up and wrapped herself around Agatha’s back, chin resting on her shoulder. Not unusual for Rio, but her grip firmer than expected.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi darling, are you busy? I thought we could do a late lunch.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was almost certain that not 15 minutes ago she’d seen Rio and Alice chowing down on their salads.
    </p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      Darling
     </em>
     ?” Wanda chose this moment to pipe up, raising her eyebrows in question at Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Once again, Rio jumped in before she had a chance to say anything.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio.” The florist stuck a hand out, position awkward as she refused to detach herself from Agatha’s back. “You are?”
    </p>
<p>
     This was most unlike Rio. Normally a natural charmer, the woman’s words were clipped with an almost dangerous undertone.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Wanda.” The Sokovian took Rio’s hand and shook it, all the while blinking between Agatha and the younger woman. “So, Rio” she continued, “it’s been a while since I’ve been back here. Are you new to town?”
    </p>
<p>
     Seizing her moment to break back into the conversation, Agatha piped up. “Yeah, Rio uh, Rio’s shop is in your old place.” The tattoo artist pointed across the street, like Wanda had suffered some incredibly niche amnesia that would’ve stopped her remembering her home of five years.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh really? Well I wish you the best of luck then Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     The florist’s responding expression could only really be described as a snarl. Clearly the conversation was not going to way she had hoped it to, and rather than digging her heels in further, she came round the side of Agatha, blocking Wanda from her view almost completely.
    </p>
<p>
     “So, is that no to lunch then baby?” Rio purred, dragging a nail absentmindedly - at least to the untrained eye - up and down Agatha’s forearm.
    </p>
<p>
     “Afraid not, Wanda and I are going to go for a coffee but I’ll come by the shop later?”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Rather than responding, Rio pulled Agatha into a short but charged kiss - nipping at her lip hard, as if marking her territory. Then, she spun on her heels leaving Agatha somewhat dazed and Wanda looking a cross between amused and baffled.
    </p>
<p>
     Once she was safely back in the flower shop the redhead spoke up once more.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Well I don’t know where you’ve been hiding that one Ags, but she’s a whole load of crazy.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Mmmm,” the tattoo artist looked back towards the flower shop, though neither Rio or Alice were in the the window now. “I guess she is.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh and you look so damn pleased about it. Right, I want to hear absolutely everything.” With that, the redhead linked their arms and pulled them in the direction of Lilia’s cafe, tracing the steps they’d taken a thousand times before.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      24th November 2026 - evening
      <span>
</span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha knocked on the glass of Rio’s shop, startling the woman who was repotting roses with her back to the window and headphones on. Spotting Agatha at the door she rose to greet her, pulling her into the shop and directing her up against the counter in one swift movement.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “I missed you.” The florist stated before peppering kisses down Agatha’s neck before reaching her collarbones, where she proceeded to lick along the lines of her two snake tattoos. Agatha could only let out a whimper in response, which turned into a low moan as Rio inserted a leg between her thighs. A hand snaked under Agatha’s shirt as Rio’s mouth loved from her collar bones to her ear, where the nipped and soothed repeatedly with her tongue.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was getting worked up, quickly. And was conscious that if she didn’t stop things now they’d end up giving the Witches’ Road quite the show.
    </p>
<p>
     “Baby.” She breathed out, “It’s not that I don’t love this, but want to take it somewhere more private?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I mean we can do, but I thought you liked to be seen with a pretty little thing in this town?”
    </p>
<p>
     “You what? Rio what’s gotten into you today? First that weird display with Wanda this afternoon and now this.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh sorry, did I embarrass you in front of your
     <em>
      girlfriend
     </em>
     ?”
    </p>
<p>
     Ding ding ding. There it was.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha and Wanda had sat down at Lilia’s for all of two seconds, the former deciding to put aside their differences for the sake of an hour, before Wanda started ribbing her mercilessly about Rio’s blatant display of jealousy that afternoon. She explained the full story of their meeting, initial dislike, tentative friendship/flirtationship into current dating situation - by the end Wanda was gleeful. Agatha groaned and batted her aways as she professed her happiness that Agatha had finally found someone who was such a perfect fit.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     She was seething with jealously, the redhead had claimed. I mean Agatha, I thought she was going to physically attack me at one point it, was extraordinary. They’d gone back and forth like this for the better part of an hour before Agatha eventually conceded that she may like Rio a bit more than someone she wanted to casually date. She even let slip that she rather enjoyed Rio’s display that afternoon, to which Wanda replied something vulgar and frankly inappropriate for a coffee shop environment.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     When they eventually parted ways it was on good terms, Agatha with the promise that she’d stay in touch - even if it was just to send hate mail to Vision’s new place of work.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     One final thing they had discussed, and which Agatha thought of now as she reached out to tuck a strand of loose hair behind Rio’s ear, was what was next for Agatha Harknesss.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio. As a much as I enjoyed your display earlier, and don’t get me wrong, I
     <em>
      really
     </em>
     did. I think you know as well as I do that Wanda is nothing but an ex-best friend and current mild irritant.”
    </p>
<p>
     Begrudgingly, Rio seemed to accept this, though she didn’t remove her leg
     <span>
</span>
     - even as Agatha began to squirm at the proximity.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “However, I thought you might appreciate me putting you mind at ease completely? Hmm.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m listening baby.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio Vidal. If I am to have a girlfriend, I can assure you it’s not going to be Wanda. In fact, if you’ll have me, I was hoping it might be you?” Agatha couldn’t help the slight feeling of queasiness as she said the words, a small part of her sure that Rio would laugh in her face.
    </p>
<p>
     Fortunately, and unsurprisingly, the florist did no such thing and instead pulled Agatha into a searing kiss - only breaking apart when the need for oxygen became too great.
    </p>
<p>
     “I think I’d like that very much, Agatha Harkness.”

<em>
      21 December 2026
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The sounds of Rio’s alarm broke through the silent apartment, followed by grumbling and a selection of muttered expletives. Her hand shot out to silence it, struggling to reach the bedside table on account of the body pinning her down.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Since making things official, this had become something of a morning routine. Agatha, it turned out, was possessive even in sleep. The tattoo artist would start out on her side of the bed and by morning would be wrapped around Rio like a koala. Not that she minded, but it did make it that much harder to leave the warm bed each morning and head down to the flower shop.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Successfully silencing the alarm, she gently pried Agatha from her torso and rolled her over to the other side of the bed before slipping out from under the covers and grabbing a robe. The older woman didn’t have an appointment until later that morning and she was loathe to interrupt her beauty sleep. With that in mind, she padded over to the bathroom, closing the door gently before turning on the shower.
    </p>
<p>
     She was rinsing the shampoo from her hair when she felt a presence nearby, turning just in time to see Agatha pull back the shower curtain. The woman slipped into the space and pull Rio flush to her chest.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Hair wash momentarily forgotten, Rio sighed as the shorter woman’s hands travelled up her torso and into her hair, pulling her into a wet kiss.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Suffice to say, by the time they’d finished the water was cold and Rio hadn’t gotten around to conditioner.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Later, after they’d bid goodbye and headed off to their respective shops, Rio let her mind travel back to the morning. She was so lost in thought that she didn’t notice the customer in her shop until they knocked lightly on the counter she sat behind.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Lilia, hi.” The florist exclaimed, jumping slightly as she was pulled from her less than savoury thoughts. “How was your weekend?”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “It was lovely thanks darling. Did Agatha tell you Teen was off visiting his parents for Hanukkah? He came back this weekend, so we went to the movies and decorated the cafe for Christmas.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Mmm she did mention. Did he have a nice time, I’m glad to hear he’s back.” And she really was. Despite all Agatha’s complaints about the boy, Rio could tell she saw him as a surrogate son of sorts and though she’d never say it, it was clear she’d missed him these past two weeks.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     She’d told Rio one evening about why the boy had been kicked out of his boarding school. He’d fallen into the wrong crowd, or so his parents had said when dropping him off at Lilia’s the night he’d been arrested for breaking and entering. The story was that he’d been convinced by a group of friends to steal a school heirloom from their housemaster’s study as an initiation - into what, he never did say. But the whole thing had gone south when he was caught by a cleaner, who - given the boy was wearing a balaclava rather than school uniform - called the police and alerted the headmaster. It didn’t sound like something the boy would do, at least not the hardworking boy who doted on his grandmother and clearly adored Agatha, but then Rio had been no stranger to the odd run in with the law in her youth, so who was she to judge. Even so, it felt harsh that his parents had sent him away not once, but twice. First to boarding school and then, when they wouldn’t have him, to live with his grandmother. Well, she thought bitterly, more fool them.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     She was once again dragged out of her thoughts by Lilia, who told her that Teen had had a fine time but was, apparently, looking forward to celebrating with some of the choice residents of the Witches’ Road. “Which is why I’m here. Are you free on Christmas, or do you have plans? I always host a dinner at mine, and I’d love if you would join us, Rio. And, if you do need persuading, Agatha will be there.” The woman’s eyes twinkled as the looked at the florist.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “That’s very kind Lilia, thank you. I must admit, all I had planned was to visit Sharon in the afternoon and well,” She coughed awkwardly, “maybe see if Agatha fancied a night cap in the evening. But yes, that sounds lovely. What time and what can I bring? I’ll still be visiting Sharon but I’m sure I could go a little earlier.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Oh that’s excellent dear, it will be so good to have you and please, just bring yourself. As for Sharon,” the cafe owner paused, her face flitting through a myriad of emotions before landing on something that wasn’t quite distain, “I suppose she can come too, if she wants.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Rio chuckled. “Oh gee, with such a meaningful invite how could she possibly say no. Seriously though, what’s your guys’ deal? Sharon never tells me these things, but it’s like, clearly you guys have some beef.”
    </p>
<p>
     This time it was Lilia’s turn to chuckle, grasping Rio’s hands as though about to impart some great wisdom. “When you’re my age, Rio, you feud, you do not - as you so eloquently put it -
     <em>
      have beef
     </em>
     . That being said, we may not see eye to eye.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, no shit. So what is it then, did she steal your husband, career, no don’t tell me,” She paused for dramatic effect, “she broke your crystal ball?” Rio was enjoying this far too much, watching as the older woman looked to the floor awkwardly, before meeting Rio’s eye again.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “She told you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed. “Yeah, Lilia, she told me. And I’ve had my fair share of petty arguments, more so since I met Agatha I have to say, but really Lilia? A crystal ball.” She raised a well manicured eyebrow.
    </p>
<p>
     “It was my best one! And it’s not even that, it’s the fact she
     <em>
      lied
     </em>
     about it.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Oh really?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Yep, said it was some schmuck who had one too many bottles of Agatha’s shitty beer on a Friday night - knocked it off the table in my back office. Which I know was a lie, because Sharon was the only one who had keys to that office.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “And why did she have keys to your office,
     <em>
      Lilia
     </em>
     ?” Rio drew out the woman’s name, who was now looking a little sheepish.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “No reason.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      Righttttt.
     </em>
     So you just go handing those keys out to anyone then? Weird really, that Agatha doesn’t have one, since you guys are so close.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Rio, I don’t know what you’re trying to insinuate but whatever it is, I assure you you’re wrong.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Whatever you say Lil. So I’ll just tell Shaz to come on down at Christmas then, no hard feelings, bring a couple of homemade mince pies and you can kiss and make up?”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Lilia, though she was now suspiciously invested in looking at a selection of plants over Rio’s shoulder, gave a half a shrug.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “You can tell Sharon that she’s more than welcome to come for Christmas, if she apologises to me properly. Capiche?”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Oh don’t worry, she will if I have anything to do with it.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Good lord, you, Agatha and Teen will send me to an early grave - I hope you know that.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “You wish you could escape us that easily. Anyway, thanks for the invite Lil. I’ll see you Thursday.” The florist rose to give the older woman a hug and kiss on the cheek, before bidding her farewell.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      22 December 2026
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “You know, I think Sharon and Lilia used to fuck.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha, having just taken a sip of her coffee, proceeded to spit it out across the table.
    </p>
<p>
     “Jesus Rio. Did you fall in the shower this morning and smack your head?”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Mmmmm you know I didn’t.” The younger woman replied, lowering her voice to an octave that made Agatha shiver. “But I’m being deathly serious, I thought you might know something about it?”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Do you think if I did you’d be covered in half my coffee order right now?”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “You make a fair point my love, but I do think I’m on to something. Like, they’re both mad at each other because of a fight they had one Friday night. They say it was over a crystal ball, but I’ve got this whole theory right.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “I know you’re going to tell me regardless, so do go on Sherlock.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Right, so I think Lilia and Sharon were sleeping together, maybe like seeing each other casually.
     <em>
      Could never be us.
     </em>
     And, one Friday Sharon maybe gets led astray, makes out with someone in Lilia’s office, knocks the crystal ball off the desk and it breaks. Lilia finds out about it and is like super jealous.
     <em>
      Relatable, by the way
     </em>
     . And so she pushes Sharon away and pretends she’s just mad about the crystal ball shit and they just never speak about it again.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sorry, you got all this from what, a two minute conversation with Lilia about Christmas dinner? Look darling I love this true crime thing you’ve got going on, you would be a fucking
     <em>
      hot
     </em>
     cop, but I think that may be a bit of a stretch.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Okay, so firstly, we’re putting a pin in the hot cop thing. Please and thank you. Secondly, I may have done a little bit of digging.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Ah, there it is. So, what did you find out?” Agatha wished she didn’t find the florist’s shenanigans quite so endearing, but alas.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “So, I spoke to Jane.” Agatha visibly bristled at the name but Rio chose to ignore her. “And she said that Dottie used to live next door to Sharon, and apparently, for a few months Lilia used to come over all the time.” She paused, waiting for Agatha’s response to this revelation.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “So, they were friends?”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Yes, well, it certainly started that way but Jane swears that Dottie once saw them in the pool,
     <em>
      naked
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh ew, Rio I don’t need that mental image thank you.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “I don’t know, it’s kinda hot.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh, you’re so fucked up Ri. Damn girl.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You love it though.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Touche. Anyway, say I believe you, what’s any of this matter now? That ship has clearly sailed, as it were.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Well that’s just it. I think Lilia still likes her? She even said she could come to dinner if she, you know, apologises.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha’s ear pricked up a little at that. As much as the older woman loved to poke fun at Agatha’s own problematic dating life, she’d never seen the cafe owner go on so much as a date since she’d known her.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “I’m a little scared to ask, but do you think she’ll apologise?”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Now my dear, that’s where I’m hoping you might come in.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Ah jeez, you’re lucky I like you Vidal. Go on then, what’s the plan?”
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      23 December 2026
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The plan had been, in Teen’s words, to Parent Trap them.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha and Rio had each been tasked with luring the two women to a neutral meeting point (incidentally, the same restaurant Rio and Agatha had gone on their first date). Here they had strong-armed them into having dinner and ultimately, reconciling.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     The whole idea was ridiculous but appeared to have been successful, as Sharon was currently sat at the bar chatting to Lilia and sipping a coffee. Agatha walked up to the two women, cutting off their conversation.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Ladies, while I am just thrilled that you two are so cosy again, please may I have the usual order for the shop. It’s the final push before we close for the holidays and you would not believe the amount of walk-ins we’ve had today. I simply cannot go on without some caffeine.”
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia rolled her eyes at Agatha’s dramatics and excused herself, preparing the orders.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     The tattoo artist returned to the studio, goods in hand, to find Rio splayed out on the couch flicking through one of her design books - much in the same way she had that first day they met. This time though she was deep in conversation with Alice and Teen as she did so. The trio were talking about a their latest obsession, the Real Housewives of Salt Lake City. Agatha knew better than to interrupt their flow, instead hading out coffees and giving Rio a quick peck on the cheek before moving towards the back to find Jen.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Got you a coffee.” She plonked the drink down next to the piercer, who was prepping her station for a 4pm client.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks.” Jen replied, curt but not unfriendly. Agatha went to leave, but paused in the doorway. “Can I help you with something, Agatha?”
    </p>
<p>
     The shorter woman flushed slightly at Jen’s accusatory tone. “I uh. I just wanted to ask if you’re coming to Lilia’s, for Christmas?” Jen had the decency to look surprised at this. She’d been invited to Christmas at the cafe owner’s for the last few years, but had never found Agatha to be particularly impressed or wanting of her presence.
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh, yeah, I am. I assume you’ll be there?”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha just nodded at this, turning as if to move back into the main studio, before pausing again.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “I’m glad. That you’re, uh, coming.” With that she stomped out of the Jen’s space and back into the front.
     <span>
</span>
</p>

     “Well,” the piercer muttered to herself, “that was fucking weird.”

     Rio was awoken that morning, not by the sounds of her alarm but by the sounds of someone clattering around the kitchen. Agatha’s penchant for drama was obvious in even the most unexpected parts of her life, which was why she could currently be heard having an argument with what was likely to be the toaster or a frying pan. It was hard to tell which over the sound of Agatha swearing, mixed with Christmas music coming out of the radio.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     That in and of itself was unusual, as Agatha didn’t strike the florist as someone who enjoyed Christmas music. Let alone the kind they played on Westview’s local radio. However, it seemed she was in a good mood that morning, despite the tiff with the frying pan, as was made clear when she bustled into the room, tray of breakfast in hand.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Morning hot stuff.” Rio pulled the covers around herself as Agatha popped the tray down on the bed and leant in for a kiss.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Mmm morning yourself, what’s all this in aid of?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Can I not treat my girlfriend on Christmas Eve?” The older woman accentuated her point by leaning over Rio, giving her a full view down the front of her robe - under which was very little.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Oh you absolutely can.”
    </p>
<p>
     The breakfast did get eaten. Eventually.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     “So, what do you want to do today?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, it is Christmas Eve. Why don’t we do something festive? How about we go to the Christmas markets in town.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Pass. I don’t want to risk bumping into Dottie, or Herb, or Jane and her gross kids.” Rio let out a chuckle at this.
    </p>
<p>
     “Right, right. Okay well, how about we stay in and watch some films, make mulled wine?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Now that sounds like a plan. I’ll pick the films.”
    </p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha, it transpired, was of the opinion that Die Hard was a Christmas film. Something that was wholly unsurprising.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     After some pretty serious bribery, they ended up choosing a selection of films - Christmas and otherwise - and spent the day curled up on Rio’s couch, only leaving for more snacks and wine.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     The day slowly morphed into evening and then night. At some point during Its a Wonderful Life Agatha had fallen asleep, curled into Rio’s side. The florist brushed away an errant hair that rose and fell with the woman’s soft snores, and drank in the sight in front of her. For the first time in, well, longer than she cared to admit, Rio felt at peace. Her shop was thriving and she had a beautiful, bonkers girlfriend who she was falling love with. No, that she loved. And that was a little scary, given they’d known each other only a few months, but it felt right and that’s what mattered. She’d lost track of what was happening in the film, so caught up in the other woman and was surprised when the credits began to roll. Glancing at the time she saw it was gone midnight, and reluctantly she gave the sleeping woman a nudge, lest she spend Christmas complaining about a bad back.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Hey, Ags, baby? It’s time to wake up.” She was met with a muffled grumble, and Agatha burying herself deeper into the crook between Rio’s neck and shoulder. Stifling a laugh, Rio braced herself before twisting up and out of her seat, making sure to keep hold of the sleeping woman as she did so. Careful not to knock over the wine glasses, she manoeuvred them across the living room floor to the bedroom where she deposited Agatha’s sleeping form. The tattoo artist was already in comfy clothes, so she needn’t wake her, instead pulling the covers up and over her girlfriend before kissing her lightly on the tip of her nose.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     She was still fast asleep when Rio returned from the bathroom, and she took one final look at her before turning off the light.
    </p>
<p>
     The florist smiled to herself in the darkness.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “G’night Agatha. Merry Christmas.”
    </p>
<p>

<p>
     To say Lilia’s house was chaotic would be an understatement.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Teen greeted the two women at the door, his cheeks were pink from the warm kitchen and he was wielding a spatula like a magic wand, but he looked happy.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “You guys made it! Come in, you can help Alice and Jen make drinks - I have a feeling whatever withes’ brew they’re creating won’t go down so well.” Agatha crossed the threshold first, giving Teen a smile and quick squeeze on the shoulder. Rio brought up the rear, arms laden with gifts.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     The three made their way into Lilia’s kitchen. Alice and Jen sat at the dining table, indeed, concocting a suspicious looking cocktail of some kind. Lilia meanwhile was peeling potatoes at an alarming speed, whilst Sharon flitted around the kitchen looking busy - though doing what, it wasn’t exactly clear.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Rio and Agatha greeted the women, removing their coats and depositing the presents before helping with the preparations. By three o’clock, the house had become less manic. Food was in the oven and everyone had loosened up after a few sips of the drinks Alice and Jen had made.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     They now sat in Lilia’s living room, Sharon and Lilia shared the smaller of the two sofas - though, sat closer than was strictly necessary for the space they did have. Jen, Alice and Teen sat on the other sofa, while Agatha had taken the armchair, Rio on her lap. This had prompted an inappropriate Santa joke from both Alice and Jen, and given Rio more than a few ideas for later.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “I’d just like to say a few words, before dinner.” Lilia piped up, looking around at the group and raising her glass in a mock toast. “Firstly, Rio, it has been an absolute pleasure to meet you and get to know you over the past few months. You’re an amazing woman, and a wonderful influence on our darling Agatha.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Here here.” Jen cut in, which drew a laugh from the whole group.
    </p>
<p>
     “And Jen, Alice. I am forever grateful to have found friends like you, and I look forward to everything there is to come.” The two women both smiled at Lilia, touched by her words. “And teen, my lovely grandson. I know the past year hasn’t been easy, and though I regret what you had to go through for it to happen, I’m so glad of the time I’ve been able to spend with you this year.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You too grandma, you too.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “And Sharon, I’m glad to have you back in my life. Truly. And I hope we can continue to,” She paused, considering her words, “repair our friendship, our relationship. I really do.” Sharon just took her hand, giving it a gentle squeeze.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Agatha.”
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Lilia.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You are one of the most stubborn people I have ever met, and it’s been a pleasure to see you grow into the woman you are today. I know you would never admit it, but I appreciate the love and the care that you have for this group. So, thank you.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Ugh, Lilia. Are you dying? Cause that’s a real buzzkill if you are.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No Agatha, I’m not dying, though I appreciate your concern.” Agatha smirked at this, giving Lilia a thumbs up that conveyed her appreciation for the woman in a way only Agatha could.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Anyway, now I’ve got that off my chest.” The cafe owner chuckled, “what do you say we go and eat?”
    </p>
<p>
     The rest of the day passed in a blur. The group ate and drank and opened presents, they played games - until Agatha and Jen had to be separated for getting too competitive - and watched Christmas specials in the evening. It was only when Lilia started to doze off on the couch, around 10pm, that the rest of the group began to go their separate ways.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice was staying a Jen’s, who only lived a short walk away, and Sharon had booked an Uber home not long before them. That left Rio and Agatha, who had stayed to help Teen do a final clear up and who now waited in the doorway, bidding their farewells.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     The two made their way outside, where large snowflakes had started to fall, coating the road in a crisp white blanket that reflected the moonlight. The couple walked arm in arm down Lilia’s street and towards the Witches’ Road in a comfortable silence until they arrived at the door to Agatha’s shop.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Come in, I’ve got a present for you.” The tattoo artist said, pulling Rio towards the door.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh baby, you shouldn’t have.” The eagerness in her voice betrayed her words as she followed the older woman into the shop and up the stairs to her flat. They made their way into the living room, Agatha directing Rio to the sofa as she went to located the gift. Rio was absentmindedly stroking Señor Scratchy’s ears when her girlfriend returned with a small package, wrapped in purple tissue paper. Rio plucked the package from Agatha’s outstretched palm and inspected it, trying to gauge what it might be from its size and weight.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “Go on then, open it.” There was a hint of nervousness in her voice as Rio tore into the package.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     The younger woman let out a surprised gasp, though barely loud enough for Agatha to hear, on inspecting the present. It was a small brooch made from what looked to be cowrie shell, but what really stood out was the engraving. It was an intricate orchid in a rich purple, one that made her think back to that first day she’d met Agatha.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      She’d thrust a pot with a purple orchid out towards the woman and bent into a strange half curtsey, half bow. “I’ve just moved into the neighbourhood, pleasure to make your acquaintance.”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     And now, on this brooch, the same orchid immortalised.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     The younger woman felt a tear threaten to fall.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “I love it, Agatha. And.” She paused for a moment, looking deep into Agatha’s eyes though knowing what she was looking for was already in front of her in the form of the brooch.
    </p>
<p>
     “And?”
    </p>
<p>
     “And, I love you.” This time it was Rio’s voice that faltered slightly, nervous that the woman, despite everything, may not feel the same way.
    </p>
<p>
     She had no reason to be, as Agatha gently pulled her into a kiss. It was softer than usual, as if trying to convey everything she was feeling without taking a breath. She pulled away, wiping the stray tear from Rio’s cheek.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     “I love you too, Rio Vidal.”
