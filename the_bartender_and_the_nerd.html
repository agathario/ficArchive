      Chapter 1: Day 1
  </h2>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p><strong>Day 1:</strong></p><p>At first, bartending and tattooing were not potential careers for Agatha Harkness. Having grown up in a strict Christian household, with her father as the pastor, Agatha was as white and blank as a piece of paper. Most of her and her siblings’ childhood revolved around the house and the church. Only when she approached high school did her parents finally enroll her in the local public school — probably because of the arrival of her youngest twin sisters. Nine children were barely manageable for her mother; eleven, with two who constantly needed attention, was impossible. </p><p>William Harkness distrusted secular American education, but his wife, Evanora, could no longer keep up with the chaos of the household. So it was decided that three of the older children—Agatha and her two brothers, unfortunately named Ezekiel and Lazarus — would attend high school. Agatha didn’t know what words God had whispered into her parents’ ears to make that happen, because William and Evanora firmly believed that a woman’s sole purpose in life was to be a God-fearing wife. Therefore, Agatha attending school unsupervised was nothing short of a miracle. </p><p>At school, Agatha discovered something that changed her life forever:</p><p><b>Women who were not her relatives or church members.</b></p><p>She still remembered vividly the first time she saw the cheerleading team at a basketball game. While other girls screamed for Troy and Lucas, Agatha’s eyes locked on Troy’s girlfriend, Rachel, balanced at the top of the pyramid. At first, guilt filled her mind. For everything Agatha had been taught, she <em>mustn’t feel this </em>— the desire swirling in the depths of her stomach. It haunted her at night. She dreamed of plum lips, chocolate skin, the curve of a waist, the tone of a muscled arm. Heat rose between her legs every time Rachel appeared in her dreams.</p><p>Then one day, while Agatha was at the library doing another thing she wasn’t allowed to do at home — drawing — her world changed again. She had found a book about witches and started doodling runes and symbols, even scenes of witches being burned at the stake. Things that would probably get her burned at the stake by her own parents. That was when Rachel sat down across from her.</p><p>Agatha swore her heart stopped beating for a second. Rachel showed interest in her drawings and, in turn, showed her something Agatha never imagined she’d see in real life — a tattoo. From that moment, Agatha’s life veered off its God-approved path.</p><p>A trip to Rachel’s brother’s tattoo studio, disguised as a math tutoring session. </p><p>An adventure to the underground bar below, in place of a cramped study night before finals. </p><p>And finally, a kiss behind the bleachers on Rachel’s graduation day — her Judas’ kiss. </p><p>Fireworks, gunpowder, dynamite, and nuclear explosions were <em>nothing</em> compared to that kiss — and what happened in the bathroom afterward.</p><p>From then on, Agatha was a storm. Even the prom king lost his queen to her. Between home, church, and school, she found herself sneaking off to Rachel’s brother’s tattoo studio under the pretense of tutoring, designing tattoos in exchange for cash. Her first tattoo eventually found its way onto her rib cage — a blowing bush of azalea. The rib wasn’t the recommended spot for a first tattoo, but it was the only place she could hide it from her parents. Ironically, it was also the place of Jesus’s wound — the blood that freed humanity from sin, just as Agatha’s flowers freed her from years of oppression.</p><p>But what will be, will be. The eldest daughter of an ultra-conservative pastor hanging out at a Black-owned tattoo studio wasn’t exactly a common sight. Rumors spread, and her mother ambushed her one afternoon, right when Agatha’s tongue was deep down a client’s throat. A slap to the cheek and some bible quoting. There was shouting, there was dragging, and there was condemnation. A sight that was hardly seen in a peaceful rural town of Ohio. A moment later, Agatha found herself with a backpack, a handful of tucked-away cash, and a one-way ticket to Cambridge, Massachusetts — the earliest bus she could catch before her father’s car reached the station.</p><p>And that’s how she ended up opening a bar with Alice, the first friend she made in Massachusetts, right next to Harvard.</p><p>Man, those students could party as hard as they studied. After finals, the bar would always be packed. The finale wrecked everyone — stress, anxiety, hormones, and emotions bottled up inside pressure cookers that took the shape of young people. They needed relief, and what was better than ear-blasting music and alcohol?</p><p>The Agatha of today was not the same girl who stepped foot in Massachusetts ten years ago. She was no longer a blank piece of paper but a well-loved canvas.</p><p>On her left bicep: a skull resting on flowers and leaves — <em>death from life. </em></p><p>On her forearm: a tarantula, because why not? Beneath it, two scissors proudly screamed her love for women.  </p><p>On her shoulders: two rabbits, her favorite animal, holding up a tarot card — the Three of Swords — symbolizing rejection from her family. </p><p>On her abdomen: the word<em> witch</em> arched over her belly-button piercing, for Agatha's first love always called her a wicked witch, in an endearing term, of course.</p><p>Behind her back: a full protective rune, a reminder of that faithful day she doodled witches in that library.</p><p>Down her right arm: designs of women and plants that bloomed. </p><p>She adored her white streak of hair. She made sure people noticed who owned <b>The Witches’ Brew</b> when they walked in.</p><p>“Two beers, please,” a young man asked.</p><p>“Coming right up,” Agatha smiled.</p><p>“Hey, do you still do full-back tattoos?”</p><p>“Depends on who’s asking.”</p><p>“I do,” another boy chimed in, barely eighteen, definitely using a fake ID.</p><p>Agatha grinned. “How about we start with something small first, huh?” She handed a beer to the first guy and a Coke to the boy. “Freshman.”</p><p>“Is it that obvious?” the boy sighed.</p><p>“Learn to shave properly first, will you?” She pointed at the razor cut on his chin. “Then find me when the sun’s still up.”</p><p>“Thanks!”</p><p>On stage, Alice was controlling the music and the crowd. She sang her heart out, shredding the guitar like it owed her money. They’d first met years ago, when they shared a room above a restaurant kitchen — the same place they both worked. Alice was an aspiring musician just been accepted into Harvard’s music program. Agatha, on the other hand, had nothing but the clothes on her back, $348 in cash, and an unknown future.</p><p>They bonded over the heat of the kitchen, cheap beer, harsh cigarettes, and shared gigs, bartending and singing at local bars. By the time Alice graduated, she’d decided not to sell her music to a capitalist producer. Instead, using the remainder of her inheritance from her mother, a former rock star, and all of Agatha’s savings from waitressing, tattooing, and bartending, they opened a bar at night and a tattoo shop during the day together. Alice got a stage to sing on; Agatha got a place to draw.</p><p>Enthusiastic humans were singing — screaming — and dancing to the music. Lights flashed like thunder in a bottle. Some cheered for a successful semester; others cried over a failed one. Even a few professors had wandered in, seeking their own kind of stress relief. The air smelled of sweat, beer, and cheap perfume, a cocktail of joy and exhaustion.</p><p>The bar was alive, throbbing, pulsing, almost breathing.</p><p>And yet, amid all that noise and color, Agatha’s attention kept returning to the figure at the far corner. </p><p>A girl sat alone at the farthest corner of the bar, dressed simply — a T-shirt and black jeans. Her hair was tied into a low ponytail, square black glasses perched on her nose. She hugged an empty old-fashioned glass, eyes fixed on her phone, reading. Headphones covered her ears as she bopped slightly to music that clearly wasn’t Alice’s set. Despite the chaos around her, she was in a world of her own.</p><p><em>Interesting,</em> Agatha thought. She shouldn’t leave a customer’s glass empty.</p><p>She walked over. “Anything more to drink?”</p><p>No answer. The girl was too deep in her own world. Agatha waved a hand in front of her face. Slowly, the girl looked up. Under the bar’s dim lights, her eyes were honey-colored, her skin glistening gold. When she pulled off her headphones, Agatha noticed the small constellation of piercings along her ear. Her T-shirt had a little green dinosaur sitting in a teacup that said <em>Tea-rex. </em>That’s an unusually adorable choice for a night at the bar, Agatha thought.</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>“What’s your poison, honey?” Agatha asked, gesturing to the glass, the pet name slipping out before she could stop it.</p><p>“What?” The girl blinked. “Sorry, I don’t understand.”</p><p>Most people at a bar tried to act cool. This girl was too honest, too straightforward for her own good. <em>Cute.</em></p><p>“We call our drinks <em>poisons</em>,” Agatha explained. “The bar’s called <b>The Witches’ Brew</b>, after all.”</p><p>“Oh, I didn’t catch that.” The girl smiled awkwardly. “My friends just dragged me here.”</p><p>“You don’t like bars?” Agatha leaned forward. “Most people I know run to one, the second the weekend starts.”</p><p>“I don’t like loud noises,” the girl admitted. “I like drinking, but the noise bothers me.”</p><p>“Hence the headphones?”</p><p>“Yeah. They’ve got active noise cancelling. You knows, when the chip iniside of these badass calculates the antiphase of the noises that they ate detecting from the outside to cancel each other out. The process is called destructive interference. That helps a little.” Her eyes lit up as she spoke. “They were the first thing I bought with my own money. I was so tired of all the street noise. These can make construction sound like soft tapping, but not car horns. Gotta hear those for safety.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, caught off guard by the flood of information from a cute living wikipedia — then laughed softly.</p><p>“Maybe next time I need a pair, I’ll call you,” she said, lingering on <em>you</em> just enough to make it suggestive.</p><p>The girl’s innocent hazel eyes met her blue ones. Maybe the hint hadn’t landed.</p><p>“Your name, dear. So I can call you next time.”</p><p>“Oh!” Realization dawned. Her face lowered and flushed, “It’s Rio.”</p><p>“I’m Agatha,” she said, holding out her hand. They shook. “Anything else I can get you, Rio?”</p><p>“Maybe another whiskey sour.” Rio nudged her glass, then smiled. “Please.”</p><p>“Sure.” Agatha smiled back and started mixing the drink.</p><p>“Thanks,” Rio said, slipping her headphones on again and disappearing back into her world.</p><p>But throughout the night, Agatha’s eyes found Rio’s more than once — and Rio’s always found their way back.</p><p> </p>

<p><em><strong>Day 2:</strong></em></p><p>A mid-week bar night wasn’t exactly an exciting scene. Most people opted for an easy evening, trying to avoid hangovers before morning lectures. Harvard’s courses were brutal enough without a fog of leftover Jägerbombs. Bad for business, sure — but nights like this gave Agatha time to rest, to think. To breathe. Especially her ears.</p><p>Tonight, Alice wasn’t playing her usual weekend set of hardcore, ear-blasting rock. Instead, she coaxed a melancholic tune from the piano. Her fingers danced over the black and white keys, pressing each note delicately and deliberately. Her body swayed with the melody, eyes closed, pouring emotion into every rise and fall of sound. Kreisler’s <em>Liebesleid</em>, Agatha recognized.</p><p>She must be on her period, Agatha thought, huffing a quiet laugh into her drink.</p><p>A few people were scattered around the bar — some playing pool, others nursing beers and murmuring softly. The atmosphere was easy, almost drowsy.</p><p>Agatha pulled out her sketchbook and started doodling. Nothing fueled her creativity like Alice’s moody piano — classical menstruation at its finest. A guy from the physics department wanted a tattoo of Schrödinger’s cat. At first, she’d thought it was just some dude’s pet. But apparently, it was a cat both alive <em>and</em> dead — typical Harvard nonsense. Maybe she could draw it half-alive, half-skeleton, chewing on an atom?</p><p>Another girl had requested an Emily Dickinson–inspired tattoo. Maybe a bird and a skeleton in a Victorian suit, welcoming you into a carriage? Harvard people were endlessly inspired.</p><p>That was the thing about living near Harvard — her clients had <em>very</em> specific inspirations.  Agatha loved it, these odd little windows into other people’s minds. Of course, there were the usual tattoos: girlfriend’s names, <em>which always made Agatha cringe because they’d be back for a cover-up soon enough</em>, birthdays, or designs they’d found online. But her favorites were the unique ones — the tattoos that made her research, sketch, and learn something new.</p><p>She hadn’t even finished high school when she ran away from home, but that didn’t stop her from wanting to learn. And she’d learned plenty. Over the years, she’d devoured books and snuck into university lectures on Norse mythology and history — she’d even taken Professor Odindottir out on a date. She’d taught herself how to draw the skeletal formulas for escitalopram, serotonin, dopamine, THC, and a dozen more; could do integrals by hand; quote Hamlet’s entire “To be or not to be” speech; sight-read music; and label every muscle and bone in the human body — eyes closed. All to please her brainy clientele.</p><p>And truthfully, she loved it. It tickled her brain in the best way. Maybe one day, she’d go back to school, if the universe allowed. It would certainly piss off her parents  — beside all the tattoos and bartending, of course. </p><p>She sketched idly, pencil smudging her fingertips, her mind drifting. The soft music, the low hum of conversation. Everything felt like it was waiting for something. Or someone.</p><p>Then, the creak of the front door pulled her out of her thoughts.</p><p>There, standing at the entrance, was Rio.</p><p>Her hair was pulled into a messy ponytail, glasses slipping precariously down her nose. She wore a T-shirt with a fish printed on the front, and her baggy cargo pants were streaked with dirt. Her Converse shoes were caked in mud. She dragged her bag to the counter and practically collapsed onto a stool, half-sprawled across the bar like she’d just survived a war.</p><p>“Rough day?” Agatha asked, pouring her a cup of water.</p><p>“My plants are dying,” Rio groaned, muffled against her arms.</p><p>“Your plants?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Rio sat up, taking off her glasses, expression grave. “I don’t know what happened. Yesterday they were fine. Today, they’re collapsing like wet spaghetti.”</p><p>“Maybe it’s because the weather’s getting colder.”</p><p>“That’s the <em>point</em>,” Rio cried, her voice soaring through the air, catching the attention of a few patrons. “They’re supposed to do better in cold weather!” She ruffled her hair in frustration.</p><p>“Whoa, whoa, calm down,” Agatha soothed. “Want something to drink?”</p><p>“Sure. Whatever.”</p><p>“Any preference?”</p><p>Rio shook her head.</p><p>“Alright,” Agatha said, grinning, “I’ll let my imagination run.”</p><p>She began mixing a drink, her eyes never leaving the exhausted woman slouched at her counter. Stress had carved deep lines across Rio’s face. Her fingers tapped an irregular rhythm on the counter as if her brain were still mid-calculation. There was something unguarded about her, soft, bright, too earnest for her own good.</p><p>“Where are your headphones?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Their battery died,” Rio muttered, knocking on her skull harder than Agatha liked. “My stupid brain forgot to charge them.”</p><p>“Hey, don’t be harsh. We all have our moments. Want me to charge them for you?”</p><p>“It’s okay. I’ll do it at home.”</p><p>Agatha tossed the shaker high — one fluid spin, caught behind her back — earning a quiet, reluctant smile from Rio. That small curve on her lips looked good on her.</p><p>“So,” Agatha asked, “what are you doing?”</p><p>Rio blinked. “Uh… drinking at a bar?”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “No, silly. I mean — studying, working… what’s your deal?”</p><p>“Oh!” Rio straightened. “I’m doing my PhD at the Plant Biology Initiative.”</p><p>Agatha’s brows rose. “Really? I pegged you as an undergrad. Aren’t you too tiny and cute to be a Harvard scientist?”</p><p>The blush that crept up Rio’s neck was worth every word. “I’m twenty-four.”</p><p>“Still a baby compared to the other PhD candidates I’ve met. At least your hair will survive the process.” Agatha slid the drink toward her. “Enjoy.”</p><p>”What’s it?”</p><p>“A Gimlet. You seem to like sour stuff, and this one’s basically hard lemonade.”</p><p>“It’s good,” Rio said after a sip. “Better than the sour whisky — not bitter.”</p><p>“Whisky Sour,” Agatha corrected, smirking. “If you don’t like it, why keep drinking it?”</p><p>“I don’t like changing. When I try new things, it takes a while for me to adjust. If I try a drink and hate it, it’ll haunt me for weeks.” She shrugged. “The sour part outweighs the bitterness, so I tolerate it.”</p><p>“Now you don’t have to tolerate it anymore, sweetheart.”</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched, but she looked down quickly — like the word <em>sweetheart</em> had short-circuited her brain. “Thank you.”</p><p>“What do you do at the Initiative?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“I’m trying to create plants that tolerate climate change better,” Rio said, perking up slightly. “Right now, I’m working with bananas.”</p><p>“Bananas?” Agatha tilted her head. “Why bananas?”</p><p>Rio smiled. “Because I like bananas.” Then, after a beat: “Kidding. The species we eat is genetically identical. If one disease spreads, they’re gone. No more bananas split. So I’m trying to create hardier versions.”</p><p>“So you’re making Christmas bananas to save humanity?”</p><p>“I’m experimenting. I’m testing their resilience in colder climates.”</p><p>“And they died. Stupid tropical fruit trees in New England weather, huh?”</p><p>Rio sighed. “But they <em>shouldn’t</em> have. I wasn’t born in Massachusetts; they were. Yet I’m alive, and they’re not.” She scrubbed her face with both hands. “Sorry.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes softened. “Tough break.”</p><p>“Sorry,” Rio said, hands still on her face. “I didn’t mean to dump that.”</p><p>“Hey, you can dump here anytime,” Agatha said, voice dipping just slightly lower. “But how about we talk about something else?”</p><p>Rio exhaled, her gaze caught the open notebook. “Schrödinger’s cat?”</p><p>“Yeah. You know it?”</p><p>“He’s kind of famous,” Rio said, smiling faintly. “You drew it?”</p><p>“Yeah. One of my clients wants it tattooed on his bicep.”</p><p>“Cool. What’s it like — drawing on skin?”</p><p>“It’s not like paper. You can’t draw a line in one go. It’s more like dotting a million tiny dots to <em>make</em> a line.”</p><p>“Oh. Does it hurt?”</p><p>“Depends. Sometimes it’s like ant bites. Sometimes it’s medieval torture.”</p><p>”Yikes!”</p><p>“You don’t like the pain?”</p><p>Rio shook her head. “I love your drawings, though.”</p><p>“Thanks, Rio.” Agatha smiled, watching her closely. “You draw too?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes lit up. “Yeah! I like designing shirts. Actually, I drew the one I’m wearing.”</p><p>“You did?” Agatha leaned over the bar. </p><p>“Yeah, I send my designs to a place that prints custom shirts. Sometimes I give them to my friends.” She sat up straighter, showing off her shirt </p><p>Agatha took a closer look at the little fish on Rio’s shirt — a spike-ball-like fish with a mustache, wearing a beret. Its mouth held a cigarette. Beneath the fish was a bottle of wine and a baguette. “Cute. He looks like he’s plotting something.”</p><p>Agatha could see Rio’s smile turning wider every second that passed.</p><p>“‘Je suis le poisson?’” Agatha read. “Why is the ‘s’ in brackets?”</p><p>“It’s French,” Rio explained proudly. “<em>Le poison</em> means poison, <em>le poisson</em> means fish. The fish is a pufferfish — it’s poisonous. The Japanese eat them all the time, but you need a certified chef. I heard it is quite an expensive delicacy, though I am not sure if it is worth it. Do you know that a lot of people don’t know the difference between poisonous and venomous? If it’s venomous, it bites you, you die. If it’s poisonous, you bite it, <em>you</em> die.”</p><p>Rio’s enthusiasm was contagious, warm, bright, utterly disarming. She reminded Agatha of hot chocolate on a winter night. Too sweet, too easy to crave.</p><p>“How about you?” Agatha asked, voice playful but edged with heat. “Will I die if I bite you?”</p><p>She watched Rio freeze, breath caught, gears visibly turning in her head.</p><p>“I’ll probably die first,” Rio stammered.</p><p>“So you’re saying I’m venomous?” Agatha leaned in, amused, and smiled, slow and wicked.</p><p>“No! No, that’s not…” Rio’s words tangled, her blush now reaching her ears. She muttered under her breath, “You’re beautiful.”</p><p>Agatha heard it. Her grin sharpened.</p><p>“What was that?” Agatha teased, enjoying the sight of Rio’s cheeks turning a deeper shade of red — not from the alcohol, Agatha had checked last time. “I’m <em>what</em>?”</p><p>“Nothing. Nothing!” Rio panickedly downed her drink and scrambled to gather her things.</p><p>“Leaving already?” Agatha asked, disappointment slipping through her voice.</p><p>“Sorry, early class tomorrow.” Rio stood, nearly tripping over the stool.</p><p>“Easy, no one’s kicking you out, <em>pretty boy</em>,” Agatha said.</p><p>Rio froze mid-step. “I…I…uh…I’ll see you around,” she managed before rushing out, the door swinging shut behind her.</p><p>Agatha leaned against the counter, a slow smile tugging at her lips. She picked up the glasses Rio had left behind, holding them delicately as if they were made of something rarer than glass. Her thumb traced the edge of the frame, and for a moment, she imagined sliding them back onto Rio’s innocently earnest face — the square lenses framing those wide, puppy-brown eyes. The image lingered, soft and disarming, and Agatha found herself smiling wider than she meant to.</p><p>“See you, pretty boy,” she murmured, the words slipping out before she could stop them. Her gaze drifted to the spot where Rio had sat, the wood still warm beneath her fingertips, and the faint scent of soil and gin still clung to the air.</p><p><br/><br/></p>

<p><em><strong>Day 3:</strong></em><br/>Open mic night — when the drunk and the delusional suddenly believed they were Frank Sinatra. Or worse, Michael Jackson, moonwalking themselves face-first off the stage. Agatha had to admit, the performances were entertaining, and the alcohol flowed like divine inspiration. Double shots, triple shots — nothing fueled musical genius quite like ethanol.</p><p>Christmas was just around the corner, which meant a flood of All I Want for Christmas Is You, sung with misplaced confidence as everyone tried to out-Mariah Carey each other. Then came Santa Claus Is Coming to Town, ironic, considering most of the people in this bar had long secured their spot on the naughty list. And of course, Last Christmas, a song that hit too close to home for too many people who’d made poor romantic decisions twelve months ago.</p><p>Agatha leaned into the chaos, wearing reindeer antlers and a Santa crop top. She’d given the hat to Alice, a small mercy, considering how many Santa tattoos she’d inked this week. </p><p>A Christmas tree stood in the corner, wrapped in purple and red tinsel. Multicolored baubles from the Dollar Tree dangled off each branch. At the top, instead of a golden star or angel, a glowing red pentagram — a “gift” from Professor Calderu of the History Department. Christmas lights ran across the ceiling in stripes of red, green, and yellow, dripping down onto the floor in soft reflections. Oversized socks with snowmen, snowflakes, Santa Claus, hung between liquor bottles. A laurel garland looped under the counter, and ribbons braided the backs of chairs like candy canes.</p><p>Despite growing up in a devout Christian household, Agatha hated Christmas. As the eldest daughter of a pastor — the ultimate sexism combo — she’d always been stuck in the kitchen with her mother, cooking for the entire congregation, cleaning the house, wrapping the gifts, and still expected to perform in the choir and the church play. Once, she’d been cast as the Virgin Mary. The irony wasn’t lost on her. There were more similarities between them than she’d ever wanted to admit — they didn’t need a man to have a child.</p><p>So yeah. Christmas didn’t mean joy or festivity to Agatha. It meant unpaid child labor. And what did she get in return? A handkerchief. She even had to hand-sew her name onto it — by <em>herself</em>, of course.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t count how many calories she’d burned shaking cocktails tonight. Her arms were sore and hot from all the mixing, cheeks aching from the mandatory customer-service smile stretched across her face. Her eardrums, she imagined, now began to look a lot like Christmas, full of glitter, numb, and one more high note away from shattering.</p><p>If one more person asked whether she had eggnog, she was going to crack a raw egg, pour brandy straight down their throat, and shake them to the <em>beat</em> of Jingle Bells.</p><p>The bar was full of holiday chaos: someone in a Santa onesie was sobbing on the phone; a group in ugly sweaters was screaming the wrong lyrics to “Deck the hall”; a girl on stage had just tried to hit Mariah Carey’s whistle tone and almost died. Agatha moved in a blur — pouring, shaking, smiling, slicing limes, dying inside.</p><p>And then, through the noise and lights and drunken singing, the door creaked open. The cold air of the night street rushed inside, but it didn’t take away the warmth of the bar.</p><p>Because in the middle of the white snow and howling wind, Rio slipped in.</p><p>Not dramatically, not like the movie entrance, Agatha's exhausted brain tried to assign her, but in that quiet, slightly clumsy way that was uniquely hers. She stepped into the bar like she hadn’t expected the world to be quite so loud tonight. Her hair was pulled into a crooked ponytail that already sagged at one side. Her navy sweater featured a reindeer tangled in Christmas lights, its expression appropriately horrified, the words Fucking Shit stitched beneath. Draped over Rio’s shoulders was a slender younger man with curly black hair and thick eyeliner.</p><p>Rio looked a little reluctant at first, like she’d been dragged out of the lab or a library by sheer force.  </p><p>She <em>looked</em>… out of place. In the softest, warmest way.</p><p>Like a calm mistake in the middle of a storm.</p><p>Rio’s face held that reluctant “not my choice” misery, until her gaze found Agatha behind the counter. Her shoulders unknotted. Warmth flooded her expression. A smile curved up — soft, reflexive, real. Rio lifted her hand and waved, small and sheepish, like she wasn’t sure she was allowed to be excited, like a toddler at the zoo who’d just been allowed to pet a goat.</p><p>Cute.<br/>Disgustingly cute.<br/>Dangerously cute.</p><p>Agatha waved back before her brain could veto the motion. </p><p>Rio and her friend settled at a table near the stage. Not her usual spot. Not the stool she always claimed like it belonged to her and her alone.</p><p>Agatha felt an unexpected pinch of disappointment — small, stupid, but there.</p><p>Still, it was nice seeing Rio with friends. Agatha had half-worried the girl was using her as a human diary. Not that she’d complained. Rio’s awkward honesty had become… <em>something</em> she looked forward to.</p><p>Now, Rio was laughing at something her friend said, shoulders shaking, her face flushed under the warm lights, but very few minutes, as Agatha shook another holiday cocktail to the brink of madness, she caught Rio glancing over.</p><p>Not beckoning.</p><p>Not demanding.</p><p>Just looking.</p><p>Like Agatha was the only steady thing in this ridiculous, glitter-covered December chaos. And each time, Agatha felt her pulse stutter, just a little, before she drowned it in another drink order.</p><p>The confident clients finally took a break between horrible renditions of Ed Sheeran and Nat King Cole. Agatha’s poor eardrums finally got a chance to soften. An instrumental version of “The First Noel” drifted from the speakers — the calm between two storms.</p><p>Which meant the <em>real</em> rush was about to hit.</p><p>Ten Margaritas.<br/>Two Old Fashioneds.<br/>One Scotch.<br/>Three martinis, shaken not stirred.<br/>Four Mojitos.<br/>Six Jägerbombs.</p><p>And then the endless parade of tequila, vodka, whiskey — shots marching across the counter like tiny soldiers. Ice clattered violently in her shaker, drowning out the music. The cold metal vibrated through her bones. Her lungs filled with alcohol fumes instead of air. By the time she slid the last drink down the bar, her hands were numb, her arms screamed in protest, and her spine felt like someone had replaced it with a metal rod.</p><p>“Excuse me,” someone called.</p><p>“Yes?” Agatha answered, sharper than intended.</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>That voice. That apology. It snapped her back like a rubber band.</p><p>Rio stood at the bar. Guilt softened her expression, her shoulders hunched like she’d been caught doing something wrong. She smiled, small, nervous, and licked her dry lips.</p><p>“Maybe I’ll come back later,” Rio murmured.</p><p>“No, no, no,” Agatha said quickly. “Sorry. Long night. What can I get you?”</p><p>“Uh… an Old Fashioned for Kate. A double vodka for Yelena. One gin and tonic for Billy. And, um…”</p><p>“A Gimlet for you?” Agatha offered.</p><p>Rio nodded, smiling with that wide-eyed, tail-wagging eagerness that turned Agatha into warm butter.</p><p>“Alright,” Agatha said, gathering ingredients. “How’s your night?”</p><p>“I was writing my report when they kidnapped me here,” Rio sighed, settling automatically onto her usual stool. <em>Her usual place.</em></p><p>“About the bananas? How are they doing?”</p><p>“Still alive,” Rio exhaled, “barely.”</p><p>“In a vegetative state, one might say,” Agatha joked.</p><p>Rio snorted a laugh — small, amused.</p><p>“Nice sweater,” Agatha added, nodding at the swearing reindeer. “Let me guess… Rude-dolf?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio grinned proudly. “I got one for each of my lab partners, too.”</p><p>Agatha glanced toward their table: two girls and the eyeliner-wearing boy. All in different custom sweaters Rio had clearly designed. The boy was wearing a red sweater adorned with a toad crowned in leaves and red berries, its neck wrapped in a candy-cane scarf. They were giving Rio a thumbs up before returning to their conversion the moment Agatha’s gaze landed on them.</p><p>“Mistle-toad,” Agatha guessed.</p><p>Rio nodded <em>vigorously</em>.</p><p>“Christmas Spirit?” The girl with short blonde hair was wearing a black sweater with what looked like a Jack Daniels bottle wearing a christmas hat.</p><p>“Yep, last one.” Rio practically bounced with pride.</p><p>Agatha squinted at the purple sweater across the room, a dog sledding down a snowy hill. She had no idea how that was Christmas-related.</p><p>“I don’t know that one,” she admitted. “I don’t like dogs.”</p><p>“Oh! What do you like then?”</p><p>“Rabbits,” Agatha said simply.</p><p>Rio blinked at her, surprised. “Really? I thought you were more of a cat person.”</p><p>“Why? Because I’m grumpy? Because I look mysterious and dangerous with my tattoos?”</p><p>“No.” Rio shook her head, soft but certain. “Because you’re elegant. The way you move behind the bar… it’s very graceful. Like a cat.”</p><p>Agatha paused mid-pour. Heat curled under her skin.</p><p>“Thanks, sweetie,” she teased.</p><p>Rio turned red instantly — a perfect, brilliant crimson. <em>Exactly</em> the color Agatha wanted.</p><p>“So,” Rio said quickly, trying to recover her dignity, “have you figured out the last one?”</p><p>“Unfortunately, no.”</p><p>Rio held up both hands dramatically and locked eyes with Agatha. “Ready?”</p><p>Agatha nodded.</p><p>“Dachshund through the snow.”</p><p>Agatha burst into laughter. Of course — dachshund. She’d always called them sausage dogs. </p><p>“I hope your friends like their gifts.”</p><p>“I hope so,” Rio said softly. “I didn’t know what else to give them.”</p><p>“But it’s not Christmas yet.”</p><p>“I might not see them,” Rio shrugged. “Kate’s flying home and taking Yelena with her. Billy too.”</p><p>“So you’re alone on Christmas?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said, completely unfazed. “I’ll probably spend it with my banana trees.”</p><p>“How about spending it with me?” Agatha suggested without thinking, or <em>maybe</em> thinking too much.</p><p>Rio froze.<br/>No — <em>she short-circuited.</em></p><p>Her soul visibly exited her body. Her mouth attempted opening and closing simultaneously. Her fingers scraped lightly at the countertop like she needed tactile proof she hadn’t fallen into the void.</p><p>Before she could get a word out, Billy swooped in and grabbed Rio by the arm.</p><p>“Rio! We want to do ‘Hotel California.’”</p><p>“Then do it,” she deadpanned. “Be my guest.”</p><p>“We want you to play the sax.” Billy pointed at the abandoned instrument on stage. No one ever touched it. Alice didn’t play it. It mostly collected dust, like a prop everyone kept pretending someone else would eventually use.</p><p>Rio groaned. “Why me?”</p><p>“Why not?” Agatha nudged her with a sly grin.</p><p>“Yeah, dude, why <em>not</em>?” Billy echoed, then grabbed the gin and tonic off the counter and chugged it like tap water. “This is mine, right?”</p><p>Agatha nodded.</p><p>“WOO! Let’s go! I’ll do drums. Kate’s on piano. We can, right?” Billy howled, slamming the empty on the table and turned around, eyes sparkling with the drunk confidence of a man who believed rhythm was a birthright.</p><p>“Sure,” she sighed. “Anything but ‘Jingle Bell Rock.’ That song’s cursed.”</p><p>“Billy…” Rio tried again.</p><p>Rio looked horrified. <em>Visibly horrified</em>. The kind of horrified that made her eyebrows try to escape her face.</p><p>Agatha leaned in, voice low, warm, teasing: “Come on, handsome.” She slid Rio’s drink toward her. “Here. Liquid courage.”</p><p>Rio stared at the drink like it was a shot of cyanide.</p><p>“But I’ve gotta bring the drinks over…”</p><p>“Go,” Agatha said, giving her a gentle push. “I’ll bring them over.”</p><p>Rio went. <em>Very reluctantly</em>. Stiff as a plank. Clutching her Gimlet like a lifeline — the blush still staining her cheeks.</p><p>Agatha watched her climb up with the world’s slowest, saddest steps. She looked small under the lights, like a shy puppy dragged into a talent show. Billy practically jumped her with the sax, throwing it over her shoulders like she was being knighted with a brass, anxiety-inducing sword. Rio grabbed it instinctively, then clung to it with both hands, frozen.</p><p>Kate tapped the opening notes, Billy joined with a shaky drumbeat, and Yelena immediately started filming like paparazzi with a mission: <em>Watch the wild Rio in her natural state — total panic.</em></p><p>Rio didn’t move. The stage lights blazed on, blasting Rio straight in the face, illuminating her blush, her raven hair, the panic carved into her shoulders and jaw. Rio froze harder. Harder than the ice in Agatha’s shaker. Harder than the polar caps. Her shoulders shot up to her ears. Her jaw clenched. Eyes wide, pupils swallowing the warm brown whole. Breath short and rapid. She held the sax so tight Agatha worried she might dent the brass.</p><p>Rio looked like she was about to pass out, or ascend to another plane entirely.</p><p>Agatha felt it like a punch in the gut.</p><p>“Alice!” she shouted toward backstage. “Lights!”</p><p>Stage lights flicked down to a warmer, gentler glow.</p><p>Rio blinked. Her face softened one millimeter. It was enough.</p><p>Agatha caught her eyes, a tiny, trembling glance, and gave her a thumbs up.</p><p>Rio inhaled deep, closed her eyes…</p><p>…and lifted the sax.</p><p>And played.</p><p>Music.</p><p>Not music. <em>Magic</em>.</p><p>The notes poured out smooth and shimmering, the sound rolling through the bar like liquid gold. It wasn’t just good, it was heartbreakingly, stupidly beautiful. So natural it almost hurt. The melody wound through the bar, curling around bodies, snapping conversations to silence. Fingers danced over the keys, precise, fluid, second-nature.</p><p>The whole bar had gone silent.</p><p>People stopped mid-drink.</p><p>Even the drunk guy who had earlier performed “Thinking Out Loud” like he was birthing a demon froze, eyes wide.</p><p>With her eyes shut, Rio became something else. Rio leaned into the melody like she was being pulled by gravity, her whole body loosening. The sax wasn’t an instrument anymore; it was a conduit. Her voice. Her confessional. Every emotion she tried to hide came pouring out as music.</p><p>Agatha forgot to breathe. Rio glowed on that stage — haloed in low light, hair catching stray reflections, hips swaying in time. A loose strand of hair danced with her movement. Her throat worked with each breath. Every sway of the hip was perfect. Every step Rio moved took Agatha's breaths away. </p><p>Agatha was struck with a sudden, ridiculous, overwhelming thought:</p><p><em>How could someone be that beautiful?</em></p><p>Rio finished with a long, aching note that lingered in the air like incense.</p><p>And then silence.</p><p>Rio still stood there with eyes still shut close, face red and out of breath. </p><p>Then Agatha clapped, loud, sharp, breaking the spell. The bar erupted into cheers. Kate bowed. Billy fist-pumped.</p><p>Rio panicked immediately. She practically yeeted the sax onto its stand, muttered something that might have been “sorry,” and all but fled the stage, face red, chest heaving.</p><p>She practically marched toward Agatha, snatched the forgotten drink off the counter, and took a swig.</p><p>“Ugh!!!” she <em>gagged</em> violently. “It tastes like rubbing alcohol.”</p><p>“Dude, what the fuck?” Yelena said, appearing like a furious Russian fairy. “That’s mine.”</p><p>“Why would you drink this?” Rio wheezed, tongue out like she could scrape the taste off.</p><p>“I’m Russian. Vodka is in my blood.” Yelena swatted her arm.</p><p>“You haven’t gone back since you were ten.”</p><p>“Details.” Yelena shrugged, then jabbed a finger into Rio’s cheek. “I make you viral. Hottest person on TikTok. You’re welcome.”</p><p>“Don’t post that.” Rio groaned.</p><p>“Sure,” Yelena lied, and turned to Agatha. “Another one, please.”</p><p>“It’s on the house,” Agatha said, pouring.</p><p>Yelena winked at Rio and skipped back to their table.</p><p>Agatha leaned forward on the bar. “That was incredible,” she said. “Didn’t know you played. Let alone like <em>that</em>.”</p><p>“I’ve been learning since fourth grade,” Rio muttered. “It means I don’t have to talk to people.”</p><p>“Well,” Agatha teased, “now you attract people because you’re that good.”</p><p>“It’s nothing.” Rio waved wildly.</p><p>“It’s not nothing.” Agatha’s tone softened. “I was definitely attracted. I’m wondering what else can that cute little mouth of yours do.”</p><p>Rio froze. Her breath caught. Her eyes darted away like touching Agatha’s gaze might ignite something.</p><p>“Thanks,” she whispered, voice cracking like a teenager’s.</p><p>“Right! I almost forgot.” Agatha reached beneath the bar and pulled out Rio’s glasses. “Here.”</p><p>Rio lit up like someone had given her a puppy. “I’ve been looking everywhere for these!”</p><p>“Can you even see without them?”</p><p>“Yeah. Reading’s harder.”</p><p>“Come closer.”</p><p>Rio blinked, obeyed. Too quickly. Too obedient. Like a kid being called by a kindergarten teacher. Then she stepped in. Close enough that Agatha could smell the faint citrus of her Gimlet on her breath. Sweat from her performance traced a line down her temple. Her chocolate-brown eyes shimmered under the bar’s dim glow. Her lips, still pink from the vodka and nerves, looked unfairly soft.</p><p>Agatha unfolded the glasses and slid them gently onto Rio’s face, fingers brushing warm cheeks. She tucked the frames behind Rio’s ears, aligning them on her button nose with delicate precision.</p><p>“There,” she said softly. “Perfect.”</p><p>Rio stared at her — really <em>stared</em> — like she wasn’t sure whether to breathe or bolt. The red on her cheeks spread all the way to her ears, eyes a little too wide, pupils a little too dark.</p><p>Rio swallowed. Hard. For a moment, there were only <em>them</em>.</p><p>Agatha realized her hand was still hovering near Rio’s cheek. She let it fall — slowly, like gravity had to think about it. Rio was still staring at Agatha like gravity had shifted.</p><p>“Th-thanks,” Rio whispered, but it came out small, breathy, unsteady.</p><p>Agatha handed her a water. “To wash down the vodka.” </p><p>Rio took it, fingers brushing Agatha’s in a slow, accidental-on-purpose slide. Her breath hitched again, barely noticeable, but Agatha noticed. She held the water like it was a holy relic and stared at it instead of Agatha.</p><p>“See you around, <em>pretty boy</em>.” Agatha said softly. Softer than she meant to. Almost an invitation. Almost a promise.</p><p>Rio took the glass. “See you around.” she echoed, voice cracking just slightly.</p><p>She walked backward for a moment, like she couldn’t quite make herself turn away, eyes locked on Agatha’s until the very last second. Only then did she spin around, nearly colliding with a chair, face flaming. She hurried back to her table, where Kate squeezed her shoulder. Billy said something that made her bury her face in her hands. Yelena waved her phone with a victorious grin.</p><p>Agatha watched them, the warmth in her chest refusing to fade.</p><p>And Rio, too, kept glancing back. </p><p>Quick, shy, flicking looks. </p><p>Checking if Agatha was still watching.</p><p>And when their eyes caught again, across the noise and the neon — something soft and dangerous fluttered low in Agatha’s chest.</p><p>Agatha hid her smile in a dish towel.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Christmas might turn out fun after all.</p>

<p><em><strong>Day 4:</strong></em></p><p><span>In contrast to popular belief, Agatha Harkness wasn’t a vampire who only functioned after sunset. She was awake during the day — especially when she had clients in her tattoo studio. Well… </span><em><span>after lunch</span></em><span>, usually. She still needed sleep to survive, despite what some customers whispered behind her back.</span></p><p><span>Today was a rare exception: she was wide awake </span><em><span>before</span></em><span> noon. Which meant she’d probably be useless by three. She had only one appointment scheduled — the young man from a few days before with the Spider-Man shoulder piece. He’d need another session or two, but otherwise the season was winding down. New Year’s Eve would bring the next wave. Nothing kick-started a resolution like permanently etching something into your flesh. The real high-traffic season came in the late summer, when newly emancipated freshmen lined up outside her studio to celebrate ‘freedom from parental supervision’ with impulsive ink.</span></p><p><span>Agatha pulled on a cream turtleneck, shrugged into a black coat, laced her heeled boots, and stepped out to enjoy her day.</span></p><p><span>Snow had mounted up along the sidewalks like piles of fluffy white cotton candy Willy Wonka had dumped across Harvard Square. Every storm seemed to forget the previous one, building new sugary peaks that students kicked down into makeshift footpaths. Boots crunched over packed ice. Bicycles creaked past, their chains whining like overworked grad students.</span></p><p><span>The cold had a personality — sharp, festive, nosy. It pinched ears, numbed fingers through gloves, and forced people to penguin-walk across the slick red-brick pavement. Every few steps, someone would skid, curse with academic creativity, then pretend they hadn’t. Cars crawled along like elderly tortoises, tires shuddering each time they hit a hidden patch of ice.</span></p><p><span>Bare-limbed trees stood like tall spindly guardians wrapped in spirals of warm yellow lights and oversized velvet ribbons. Decorations hung everywhere, none of them subtle: inflatable snowmen slumped on porches as if they’d given up on life; Santa figurines clung desperately to chimneys; a reindeer mascot wheezed between its automated breaths like it was dying of seasonal exhaustion. Someone had even taped googly eyes to a dorm wreath, giving it a deranged but very committed festive stare.</span></p><p><span>Agatha ducked into a tiny corner diner for lunch. Warm air escaped past her like a relieved sigh, carrying cinnamon and the smell of wet wool. “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” blasted loud enough to rattle the windows. The place was packed, students thawing out over soup, locals hiding from the weather, tourists wondering why they’d ever left their hotel.</span></p><p><span>She should probably grab her food to go and eat it on the sofa with the latest episode of </span><em><span>RuPaul’s Drag Race</span></em><span>, she decided.</span></p><p><span>When she reached the counter, she discovered the cashier was the overly confident drummer from last night — Billy. He still wore thick eyeliner, though she doubted it was the same application from the show. His curly hair was a mess. Deep eye bags announced last night’s poor decisions. His black nail polish chipped. The swagger was gone; what remained was a grumpy twenty-something regretting all of his life choices.</span></p><p><span>“Hi, what can I get for you?” Billy asked.</span></p><p><span>“Hi. Can I get mac and cheese with bacon, coleslaw, corn soup, and a hot latte — to go.”</span></p><p><span>“Okay, that's it? Oh! Hey. It’s Agatha, right?”</span></p><p><span>“Yeah. Busy day, huh?”</span></p><p><span>“Yeah, you know it.” He nodded miserably. “I shouldn’t have drunk that much last night. Forgot I was on cashier duty.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha remembered. After the performance, Billy had been practically possessed. The kid was riding enough adrenaline to power the whole East Coast, slamming shots until she had to cut him off for fear of alcohol poisoning. The other guys at the bar hadn’t helped, egging him on. Meanwhile, Rio had fallen asleep halfway through the night, forcing Billy to give her a piggyback ride home — somehow still steady enough to manage it. Agatha hadn’t gotten the chance to say goodbye.</span></p><p><span>“How’s Rio?” she asked.</span></p><p><span>“She’s fine. We made it home in one piece. She actually made it to her room. I didn’t. I woke up on the kitchen floor.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s unfortunate,” Agatha huffed. “Next time, take it down a notch.”</span></p><p><span>Billy shrugged. “But hey, I got that cute boy’s number. So it wasn’t all bad.”</span></p><p><span>“Billy, stop chit-chat!” Yelena yelled from the kitchen.</span></p><p><span>“She is the last one!” Billy yelled back.</span></p><p><span>“Then hurry up and get </span><em><span>in</span></em><span> the kitchen!”</span></p><p><span>“Alright, alright!” He rolled his eyes, then turned back to Agatha. “Okay, that’s $13.25. Here’s your receipt. I’ll call you when it’s ready.”</span></p><p><span>“Thanks, Billy.” Agatha handed him her card, took the receipt, and found a corner seat to wait.</span></p><p><span>Agatha wondered what she’d even do for Christmas this year. Christmas Eve was still a work night, but the 25th? She’d be completely alone. Alice had hopped off to Florida with her new girlfriend, Jen, who had somehow managed to get the holiday off despite working at Mass Gen — a small miracle, and one they weren’t about to waste. Alice had even offered to let Agatha third-wheel, but she had zero interest in watching a romance bloom while she slow-roasted under the Florida sun.</span></p><p><span>It had been a long time since Agatha spent Christmas by herself. Back home, solitude was impossible; her siblings filled every hallway with noise then there was church. Later, she’d spend the holiday around the tattoo studio of Lionel — Rachel’s brother, surrounded by Rachel’s family, inhaling their grandmother’s mac and cheese and corned beef. To this day, she regretted never asking for the recipe; nothing she’d eaten since had come close. She still didn’t understand why that family had accepted her so easily, even when they’d known exactly what she and Rachel were. The laughter, the ease, the warmth — the feeling of not needing to hide. The feeling of being free.</span></p><p><span>Now she </span><em><span>was</span></em><span> free. And yet she could feel the empty space where something — someone — should be.</span></p><p><span>“Agatha, your order’s ready!” Billy’s voice sliced clean through her thoughts.</span></p><p><span>She walked to the counter and saw two brown bags: one with her name, one labeled </span><em><span>RIO - 126 </span></em><span> in Billy’s chaotic handwriting.</span></p><p><span>“Hey, quick favor?” Billy asked. “Can you bring this to Rio?”</span></p><p><span>“Why?” Agatha raised a brow.</span></p><p><span>“I know she only had a bowl of Raisin Bran with me this morning. I tried calling, but she’s not picking up. Probably hyper-fixated on something again.”</span></p><p><span>“Okay… and why can’t either of </span><em><span>you</span></em><span> take it to her?” Agatha pressed.</span></p><p><span>“I’ve got an hour on shift and then I have to sprint for the train. Same for Yelena.” He pulled out the puppy-dog eyes — the same ones Rio used — and aimed them directly at Agatha. “Please. I don’t want to find her unconscious in the greenhouse </span><em><span>again</span></em><span>.”</span></p><p><span>“It has happened before?”</span></p><p><span>“Well, not on Christmas,” Billy admitted, “but yeah. She forgets to eat constantly. I truly don’t know how she’s lived this long.”</span></p><p><span>“We thought she was dead,” Yelena called from the kitchen. “She still hadn’t reviewed my thesis. I was terrified.”</span></p><p><span>“Terrified you’d find your friend unconscious?” Agatha asked with doubt.</span></p><p><span>“No, terrified I would have to rewrite my thesis.” Yelena shuddered. “Nightmare.”</span></p><p><span>“Right.” Agatha grabbed the bags. “Where’s the greenhouse?”</span></p><p><span>“Go two blocks right, then turn left. Keep straight on Oxford Street — you can’t miss it.” Billy dug a key from his pocket. “Here. In case she locked the door.”</span></p><p><span>“You’re just giving me the key to your lab?”</span></p><p><span>“What are you gonna do?” Yelena snorted. “Steal a banana tree? Kidnap our lab assistant?”</span></p><p><span>“Why not? She </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> cute.”</span></p><p><span>“Yeah, whatever,” Billy said. “Just don’t touch the weed. It’s experimental. We’re… not entirely sure what it does yet.”</span></p><p><span>“You’re more worried about your experimental weed than your friend, housemate, and lab assistant?”</span></p><p><span>“Hey, you won’t harm her and she won’t harm you,” Billy said flatly. “The weed? That’s less certain. Now go, before she becomes compost or something. I’m sure she’ll be happy to see you.”</span></p><p><span>“Alright, guys. See you after Christmas.” Agatha headed for the door.</span></p><p><span>“Thank you!” Billy and Yelena called in unison as she stepped back out into the cold.</span></p><p><span>The cold air in Agatha’s lungs and the slippery street beneath her boots felt the same as always, but the tingling excitement in her chest was new. Her heart beat faster. Her feet moved quicker. Heat flushed her cheeks, and she kept catching herself smiling for no good reason at all — or one very good reason, if she admitted it.</span></p><p><span>The air smelled like a strange mix of roasted chestnuts and hot chocolate. A cappella groups practiced on the corner, harmonizing through chattering teeth. Somewhere across the Yard, a lonely saxophone was playing “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,” drifting through the cold air like a ghost. Garlands and fairy lights trimmed old lecture halls, giving the ancient brick buildings a warm postcard glow that almost — almost — made the bitter chill bearable. Snow gathered on every crimson banner, dusting the Harvard crest with sugary white, like the whole campus had been dipped in confectioner’s sugar.</span></p><p><span>Then she saw it: behind a more modern building, a glass roof gleamed. The greenhouse.</span></p><p><span>She stepped inside the main building. It reminded her of high school with long, echoing hallways, sterile white overhead lights, polished floors, and the lingering scent of disinfectant. Rio’s lab was in room 126, all the way down the hall.</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt wildly out of place. Her black boots clicked too loudly. Her wild hair, especially the white streak in her bangs, drew looks. Even bundled in layers, several tattoos peeked out at her wrists and thighs. Students turned to stare, not with judgment, but with the mild curiosity of people who lived in labs and forgot the rest of the world existed. She’d get fewer looks in an art building, that was for sure. But here? In a building full of people whose IQ likely resided in the top 2%, who voluntarily spent their days locked in rooms with plants and test tubes? Of course, she stood out.</span></p><p><span>She reached room 126 and knocked.</span></p><p><span>No answer.</span></p><p><span>She knocked again. Nothing.</span></p><p><span>The handle didn’t budge. Locked.</span></p><p><span>Just as Billy predicted.</span></p><p><span>Agatha pulled the key from her coat and let herself in.</span></p><p><span>Chaos greeted her. Papers, books, and open notebooks covered the central table. An army of mugs gathered near the microwave, forming a small ecosystem of their own. A laptop sat open, its battery barely clinging to life. A phone with a cracked screen lay next to it, abandoned.</span></p><p><span>She set the lunch bags down and scanned the room.</span></p><p><span>“Rio?” she called.</span></p><p><span>Only the hum of machinery replied.</span></p><p><span>Not ideal.</span></p><p><span>A narrow path cut through the clutter, leading toward the back. Agatha followed it, stepping into the greenhouse. </span></p><p><span>Warmth washed over her immediately — a humid, gentle contrast to the Massachusetts winter. Lush greenery lined either side, thriving far more enthusiastically than the skeletal trees outside. Strange plants she’d never seen before grew in clusters. Exotic flowers bloomed in bright reds, yellows, and oranges, painting the air with color. </span></p><p><span>Billy’s warning echoed in her mind, and she kept her hands to herself.</span></p><p><span>“Rio?” </span></p><p><span>No answers. </span></p><p><span>“Rio!!!” Agatha called again.</span></p><p><span>Then Agatha saw her: that unmistakable bobbing black ponytail weaving through the crowd like a metronome set to ‘antisocial.’ Rio had her headphones in — of course, she did — shut off from the world with the serene obliviousness of someone who would walk through a parade without noticing the elephants.</span></p><p><span>Agatha stepped deeper in, passing what she assumed was Yelena’s marijuana. </span></p><p><span>And there Rio was.</span></p><p><span>Standing in front of a banana tree that had no earthly reason to exist in a Boston December, she held her camera as delicately as a relic. A wrinkled lab coat hung off one shoulder like it had given up trying to stay on her properly. Streaks of dirt patterned the hem. A sort of accidental Jackson Pollock earned from whatever grave-digging science she’d been doing that afternoon.</span></p><p><span>Her brow was furrowed in concentration, breath puffing softly in the cold air, completely unaffected by the rowdy bar around her, like she had stepped through the wrong door and landed in the wrong universe.</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt her heart twinge — somewhere between fondness, amusement, and that warm tug she hated admitting was becoming familiar.</span></p><p><span>“What are you doing?” Agatha tapped Rio’s shoulder.</span></p><p><span>“Oh! Hi Agatha!” Rio lowered her headphones and handed Agatha a banana leaf, “Here, hold this!”</span></p><p><span>“What exactly are you doing?” Agatha repeated.</span></p><p><span>“Taking pictures of the leaves,” Rio said, perfectly casual.</span></p><p><span>“Why?”</span></p><p><span>“For my winter report. Can you shine a light for me?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha raised her phone flashlight overhead. Rio snapped several pictures, squinting critically at each.</span></p><p><span>With a long, dramatic sigh, Rio straightened. Agatha finally got a clear look at her shirt — a black tee with a skeleton dual-wielding machine guns in celebration, the word </span><em><span>Autism</span></em><span> arched above it in flaming letters.</span></p><p><span>Classic Rio.</span></p><p><span>“I think that the leaves should be green, not black,” Agatha suggested.</span></p><p><span>“Yeah, they’re dying,”  Rio muttered, flipping through her pictures. “I mean, it’s warm in here, but not warm </span><em><span>enough. </span></em><span>They’re all gonna go. Ugh.”</span></p><p><span>“Well, it’s not exactly Hawaii.”</span></p><p><span>“Bananas grown in Hawaii </span><em><span>don’t</span></em><span> make a PhD thesis.” Rio turned to her.</span></p><p><span>“I know, </span><em><span>sweetie</span></em><span>.” Agatha patted Rio’s back. She could feel the girl startle from the touch, but soon her muscles loosened up."So, tell me. What are you guys doing here?”</span></p><p><span>“It’s Professor Davis’s lab. We’re developing plants with high climate resistance.”</span></p><p><span>“And the marijuana?”</span></p><p><span>“That’s Yelena’s.” Rio pointed to the patch. “Billy helps me. Kate handles the orchids.”</span></p><p><span>“Cool.” Agatha looked around. “So these are your bananas?”</span></p><p><span>“Yeah. That’s Phoebe, Chappell, John, Paul, Lisa, and Matthew.” Rio gestured to six trees.</span></p><p><span>“You </span><em><span>named</span></em><span> them?” Agatha grinned.</span></p><p><span>“Only the ones doing okay.” Rio pointed toward the back. “Those aren’t named yet. I don’t want to get emotionally attached.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha could practically </span><em><span>see</span></em><span> her sitting here ranking banana-tree-worthiness, picking out names for them, and the image sent an unexpected bloom of warmth into her chest.</span></p><p><span>“What are you doing here anyway?” Rio asked. “How did you find me?”</span></p><p><span>“I got lunch at your minions’ place. They sent me to bring you food.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh shit! What time is it?” Rio started patting herself down. “Where’s my phone?”</span></p><p><span>“It’s almost two. Phone’s on the table.”</span></p><p><span>Rio froze. “Fuck! I promised Billy I’d stop by before he left.”</span></p><p><span>“He’s probably on the train by now.”</span></p><p><span>Rio groaned into her hands. “I keep worrying about these stupid trees, and I can’t focus on anything else. I’m such an idiot.”</span></p><p><span>“Hey, no.” Agatha stepped closer, her hand warm on Rio’s back. “He knows you’ve got a lot going on. And Yelena’s definitely not mad.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m the worst. I can’t even keep a simple promise.”</span></p><p><span>“They sent you lunch,” Agatha reminded her gently. “They’re not mad.”</span></p><p><span>“They shouldn’t have bothered you.” Rio’s voice went small. “I could’ve grabbed something later.”</span></p><p><span>“And when would that be?” Agatha arched a brow. “You can’t survive on a single bowl of Raisin Bran.”</span></p><p><span>“How do you know???? Billy told you, didn’t he?” Rio asked, horrified. “God.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s why you fainted,” Agatha said.</span></p><p><span>“They told you that, too?!” Rio groaned.</span></p><p><span>“Yes. Now come on. Let’s eat before you become plant food.” Agatha took her arm and steered her toward the lab.</span></p><p><span>Rio didn’t resist. If anything… she leaned in.</span></p><p><span>Billy had packed Rio a cheeseburger, French fries, and a Coke. Rio grabbed a handful of ice from the freezer and dumped it into the cup like she was completing some sacred ritual. Agatha laid the food on the table, arranging it nicely and centered, as if presentation might compensate for how violently the fries had been shaken in transit. </span></p><p><span>“Aren’t you cold?” Agatha asked, watching Rio take a long sip of frosty Coke. </span></p><p><span>“Of course," Rio nodded, “It’s snowing.”</span></p><p><span>“Then why are you drinking Coke with ice?”</span></p><p><span>“Because that’s the natural order of things,” Rio said seriously. “Cheeseburger with American cheese, extra pickles. Fries with ketchup. Coke with ice.” She lifted each object like a scientist giving a demonstration.</span></p><p><span>Agatha snorted. “Fun fact: I didn’t have a Coke until I was fifteen.”</span></p><p><span>Rio nearly choked on a fry. “How? They’re everywhere. I think I had my first before I could walk.”</span></p><p><span>“My parents thought Coke was the gateway to sin. Truly. They were convinced drinking sugary brown water would get me pregnant at sixteen.”</span></p><p><span>“That doesn’t make any sense.” Rio frowned, actively trying to map the logic. “That is not even the right body system.”</span></p><p><span>“It doesn’t have to.” Agatha shrugged. “It was just a control tactic. And honestly? They weren’t totally wrong. After my first can of Coke, the next thing my tongue touched was the Chapstick on the cheer captain’s lips.” She scooped up macaroni like she hadn’t just dropped a bomb. “Way more sinful than getting pregnant.”</span></p><p><span>Rio blinked. “…Right.”</span></p><p><span>“My dad was a pastor,” Agatha went on, “so image was everything. As the eldest daughter, I had two jobs: be femininely well-behaved and stay a virgin until I married a nice Christian man. Preferably white.”</span></p><p><span>“What exactly is</span><em><span> femininely well-behaved</span></em><span>?” Rio asked, genuinely curious.</span></p><p><span>“You know. Cooking for a family of ten, cleaning like a Victorian servant, sewing — as if we’re still in the 1800s — reading the Bible. Also, I wasn’t allowed to wear pants. Only dresses past the knee.”</span></p><p><span>Rio made a face. “That sounds like a documentary about misery.”</span></p><p><span>“Then one day my mom walked in on me kissing a girl in a tattoo shop.”</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded solemnly. “Double femininity energy.”</span></p><p><span>“Exactly.” Agatha laughed. “My mom slapped me so hard I fell off the chair. Called me names that would get bleeped on cable. My brothers dragged me through the street like a rag. And apparently, my dad came after me with a gun. They would literally rather have a dead daughter than a gay one.”</span></p><p><span>Rio paused mid-bite. “Your parents sound…”</span></p><p><span>“Controlling? Superstitious? Overly religious? Insane? Fucked up?”</span></p><p><span>“Something like that.”</span></p><p><span>“How about your family?” Agatha changed the subject.</span></p><p><span>“Oh, they’re typical.” Rio shrugged. “Not great, not terrible. I was baptized — every kid in Puerto Rico gets baptized.”</span></p><p><span>“You’re from Puerto Rico?” Agatha’s eyebrows shot up.</span></p><p><span>“Yeah, but we moved to Delaware when I was one.” Rio shrugged. “So yeah, I’m Catholic… in a historical sense, you know — guilt but with better music. My mom used to make me go every Sunday. I hated that she made me wear dresses. She still does whenever I visit.”</span></p><p><span>“So you hate church because of the dress code?”</span></p><p><span>“Not exactly. Mass isn’t that bad. There are set patterns: when to sit, kneel, stand, and respond. And I like patterns.” Rio shrugged again. “The singing’s nice. I like learning about religion. I just don’t… believe in it. I approach it academically. Jesus was a smart guy in the first century who got people to listen to him. Cool dude. His followers? Not usually cool.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha laughed into her coffee.</span></p><p><span>“My dad thinks my faith isn’t strong enough,” Rio added. “He prays every day that I’ll come back. They mostly leave me alone now.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s… not the worst,” Agatha said carefully. “Better than chasing you with a gun.”</span></p><p><span>“True,” Rio admitted. “But they still don’t understand me. I was quiet. I didn't talk until I was four. Spent all day drawing or reading. They thought I was just shy or slow.” Rio frowned at her burger. “But really, the world just didn’t make sense. Still doesn’t. I prefer being alone. It’s easier.”</span></p><p><span>Her voice softened, trembling. “The older I get, the more alien I feel. I can function, I learned patterns, but inside my head it’s like a nuclear core overheating.” She swallowed, searching for words. “I think I have autism. But I was never diagnosed. My parents didn’t want a label. They didn’t want people thinking I’m crazy.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha saw her fists slowly clench on the table. Saw her gaze go unfocused and far away.</span></p><p><span>“Rio.” Agatha gently reached across the table. Rio didn’t move away. Her fists didn’t unclench, but she let Agatha touch her hand. “You’re not crazy. Your brain just works differently. That’s all.”</span></p><p><span>Rio huffed a wet laugh. “I’m a Mac in a Windows world.”</span></p><p><span>“You’re the deluxe limited edition,” Agatha countered. </span></p><p><span>Rio blinked rapidly, tears threatening. “I know. I don’t give a </span><em><span>fuck</span></em><span> what people think anymore. I have friends. Not a lot, but real ones. And I’m doing a PhD at twenty-four. So yeah, I’m a little… nutty. But it’s sad knowing my parents won’t accept me.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha moved her hand so it covered Rio’s fully — steady, grounding. “I’m sure they’re proud of you. They raised a brilliant, beautiful woman.” Her thumb brushed slow, soft circles over Rio’s skin. “Maybe they’ll come around. Maybe they won’t. But you have people who accept you absolutely. Billy. Yelena. Kate.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s hazel eyes lifted, meeting hers, startled. “You too?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha held her gaze. “Yes, Rio. Me too.”</span></p><p><span>Something tender flickered between them — warm, fragile, tentative as a lit match in winter air. Agatha’s coffee suddenly tasted sweeter than it ever had a right to be. Rio had gone back to chewing her burger, but with a little more focus than strictly necessary, like chewing was now a high-stakes activity.</span></p><p><span>“Sorry,” Rio said after a moment. “I dumped my frustration on you again.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s kind of my job.” Agatha shrugged lightly. “You wouldn’t believe the sheer amount of confessions I hear.”</span></p><p><span>Rio perked up. “What’s the worst?”</span></p><p><span>“Hmm… not the worst,” Agatha mused, swirling her spoon. “But a girl once told me she told her boyfriend she had to spend Christmas with her family because she didn’t want to meet his family. Then she told her family she had to work on Christmas because she hated her stepmother. So she ended up spending Christmas with me. Of all people. Very festive trauma bonding.”</span></p><p><span>Rio chewed thoughtfully. “That’s not so bad.”</span></p><p><span>“The secret?” Agatha asked.</span></p><p><span>“No,” Rio shook her head, smiling shyly. “Spending time with you.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha felt her pulse jump. A smile tugged at her lips before she could stop it. A warmth spread across her cheeks before she could command her body to chill. She had to glance away, because looking at Rio suddenly felt like leaning over something dangerously deep.</span></p><p><span>“So…” Rio nudged. “What are you doing tomorrow? You know, Christmas Eve and all.”</span></p><p><span>“Probably working. We’re still open.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh.” Rio poked at a lone fry. “I forget that’s… kind of peak bar season.”</span></p><p><span>“You got any plans?”</span></p><p><span>“Not really. Haven’t thought about it.” She carefully folded her burger wrapper into a perfect rectangle — ultimate Rio stress origami.</span></p><p><span>“You’re not going home?”</span></p><p><span>“My parents flew to Thailand. And I don’t like any of my relatives.” A beat. “Except abuelo. But he’s dead.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh.” Great. Perfect. Outstanding. Suggesting family time after that was a creative new form of emotional self-own. Maybe she should jump out the window.</span></p><p><span>Silence descended — thick, awkward, humming with too many things unsaid. Agatha’s stomach tightened. Had she said something wrong? Pushed too far too fast? The worry crept in painfully quick.</span></p><p><span>Then Rio stood abruptly. “Wait here.”</span></p><p><span>She walked off toward the greenhouse, vanishing before Agatha could breathe. </span></p><p><span>Oh God. Agatha had definitely made her uncomfortable. Fantastic. Incredible. She’d been so close to cracking Rio’s shell, and now she’d scared her off. Maybe Rio would stop talking to her. Maybe she’d quit. Maybe she’d flee the country.</span></p><p><span>Just as panic was beginning to braid itself into a full mental breakdown, Rio returned, holding a purple orchid, delicate and bright. </span></p><p><span>“There,” Rio leaned in and tucked the flower into Agatha’s hair, her fingers brushing Agatha’s cheekbone like an accident that lingered a millisecond too long. “Perfect. You like purple, right?”</span></p><p><span>“Yeah, how did you—” Agatha’s brain momentarily short-circuited.</span></p><p><span>“You always wear purple when I see you. Today is the only day you aren’t.”</span></p><p><span>“There is,” Agatha murmured with a slow, wicked little smile.</span></p><p><span>It took Rio a couple of seconds. Then her face went scarlet, like someone had twisted a dial from “baseline anxiety” to “full system meltdown.” She sat down fast and stared intently at the trash like it held the secrets of the universe.</span></p><p><span>“Sorry,” Rio mumbled.. </span></p><p><span>“Wait — is it okay?” Agatha gently plucked the flower from her hair, turning it between her fingers. “Isn’t this Kate’s orchid?”</span></p><p><span>“It’s fine,” Rio waved a frantic hand. “Her plants are thriving. One missing flower won’t kill her.”</span></p><p><span>“No, I mean — did I just put some mutant greenhouse death-orchid in my hair? Billy mentioned experimental weed.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s Yelena’s. Never touch Yelena’s plants. Ever. We don’t know what they do yet.” Rio warned gravely.</span></p><p><span>Agatha laughed. “Well… It’s beautiful. Thanks, Rio.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s blush softened into something warm, shy, real. “You’re welcome. I’m glad you like it.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha leaned forward, resting her elbows on the table. “Hey. If you don’t have plans tomorrow, feel free to drop by.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s eyes widened. Like — visibly. Like she had to physically process the meaning of the words.  “Can I?”</span></p><p><span>“Sure.”</span></p><p><span>“But you’ll be busy,” Rio said, rubbing the back of her neck. “I don’t want to bother you.”</span></p><p><span>“You’re not a distraction.” Agatha’s voice came out low, warmer than she meant it to. “I like having you around. I like listening to your random knowledge.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s inhale hitched before she could catch it. She thought for a long moment, long enough to make Agatha’s stomach flip. Then finally, her eyes softened, not wide, not startled, but warm. Warmer than anything in the room. She nodded. </span></p><p><span>“Okay. I’ll come.”</span></p><p><span>“Great.” Agatha stood, reaching automatically before thinking. “By the way, you have a little —”</span></p><p><span>Her thumb brushed the corner of Rio’s mouth, wiping away a stubborn smear of ketchup. Warm skin beneath her touch. Rio froze like she’d been hit with a tranquilizer dart. Eyes wide like a melted chocolate bar. Pupils blown. Breathing like someone who had just survived a surprise emotional rollercoaster. She made a noise. Not a word — just a noise. Something between a squeak and a malfunctioning appliance.</span></p><p><span>And there it was.</span></p><p><span>The deep, long-awaited crimson flooded Rio’s cheeks.</span></p><p><span>Agatha swallowed a smile. “I’ll throw these out on my way.”</span></p><p><span>She gathered the trash, pausing in the doorway. Just long enough for Rio to look up. Their eyes met — held — softened. A heartbeat stretched, impossibly long and unbearably electric.</span></p><p><span>“See you tomorrow,” she said softly. Then, with a wicked little glint, let it simmer: “</span><em><span>Pretty boy</span></em><span>.”</span></p><p><span>And with that, she slipped out the door, the orchid still tucked in her hair, heart thudding with bright, dizzy excitement, leaving behind a frozen Rio, now with blush deepened, traveling all the way to her ears. </span></p><p><span>Agatha stepped into the cold, heart fluttering like something with wings.</span></p><p><span>Tomorrow couldn’t come fast enough.</span></p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p><strong><em>Day 5:</em></strong></p><p>There were butterflies in Agatha’s stomach, and she knew exactly why. The bar was <em>crowded, beautifully, annoyingly, exactly-as-predicted</em> crowded. People swarmed the counter, ordering drinks like hydration was a competitive sport. On the TV above the shelves, <em>Home Alone</em> played: Macaulay Culkin setting elaborate traps for Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, the usual yuletide violence.</p><p>Agatha had never watched <em>Home Alone</em> growing up. Her family cycled through It’s a <em>Wonderful Life</em>, some cheaply made Nativity film, <em>The Ten Commandment</em>, and for reasons she still didn’t understand <em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em>. Snoopy, naturally, had stuck with her.</p><p>But right now, none of the hundred faces in the room mattered. She was scanning for exactly one.</p><p>No luck. Again.</p><p>Agatha let out a sharp sigh, shoulders slumping.</p><p>“Hey,” Alice popped up at the bar like a Jack-in-the-box. “Two Screwdrivers.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes stayed glued to the crowd.</p><p>“Earth to Agatha.” Alice waved a hand dramatically in Agatha’s eyeline.</p><p>“What?” Agatha groaned, snapping back to reality.</p><p>“Are you okay? You look… distracted.”</p><p>“Nothing,” Agatha muttered, too fast, grabbing a shaker.</p><p>Alice raised a brow. “Really? Nothing? Not even, say, a certain glasses-wearing girl you’re totally waiting for?”</p><p>“Shut up,” Agatha muttered, pointing a warning finger. “Don’t you have a girlfriend to entertain?”</p><p>“Since when is my life prime-time entertainment for you two?” Agatha asked, slamming ice into the tin.</p><p>“Since that saxophone got involved,” Alice said cheerfully. “Girl, you were looking at her like she was a piece of Wagyu steak.”</p><p>“I was <em>not</em>.”</p><p>“You were <em>drooling</em>,” Alice said, grabbing the glasses.</p><p>“No, I wasn’t.” Agatha’s voice came out sharper than she meant.</p><p>“And yesterday you came home with a <em>flower in your hair</em>.” Alice nodded toward the counter. There sat the purple orchid — Rio’s orchid — resting in a glass of water exactly where Rio usually perched. Still fresh. Still impossibly bright against the dark wood. Agatha prayed whatever chemical nonsense they’d done in the lab would keep it from wilting. The idea of it dying felt… symbolic in a way she didn’t care to unpack.</p><p>“And you brought it to work,” Alice added, way too delighted. “Someone’s got a little crush.”</p><p>“Shut. Up.”</p><p>Alice laughed. “This is way better than watching Kevin set burglars on fire.” She waltzed back to Jen, triumphant.</p><p>Alone again behind the bar, Agatha exhaled. She was worried, all right. They’d hung out multiple times now, yet smooth, professional Agatha had never once thought to ask for Rio’s number. Maybe because she’d been too busy trying to turn Rio’s cute face pink. Which was fun. Very fun. But it also meant that now Agatha had spent an entire day with absolutely no way to reach her.</p><p>Sure, she <em>could</em> go find her in the lab, but that felt like invading the space of a shy deer who might spook if approached too quickly. The last thing Agatha wanted was to scare her off.</p><p>A draft of cold air cut through the room. The door opened.</p><p>Agatha’s head snapped up, heart leaping into her throat.</p><p>But the figure who walked in was unfamiliar.</p><p>Just another student. No glasses. No dark ponytail. No lab coat that looked like it had barely survived a controlled explosion. No soft, shy smile tugging one corner higher. No faint scent of cold air and greenhouse soil that seemed permanently woven into Rio’s clothes.</p><p>Agatha’s heart dropped like someone had unplugged it. She sighed again, heavier this time. It was only 10 p.m., yet somehow the night already felt endless.</p><p>Another agonizing hour bled by. Each hour felt like it was personally mocking her. Agatha tried to steer her focus back to the customers, concentrating on satisfying their increasingly deranged Christmas wishes.</p><p>She replaced sugar syrup with maple syrup (“for the <em>seasonal terroir</em>,” a man in an identical Harvard scarf explained).</p><p>She heated up wine in a saucepan so it tasted vaguely like mulled wine, even though it definitely tasted more like desperation.</p><p>She made a Mojito with pine needles instead of mint because of “Christmas,” and tried not to stab the man with his own candy cane when he said, “Isn’t this more… <em>aromatic</em>?”</p><p>She served shots in hollow plastic baubles that kept rolling off the tray like they were suicidal — “Instagram!” a girl squealed.</p><p>And the worst: people tipping her with mistletoe. </p><p>Actual mistletoe. </p><p>Because nothing beat a “Merry Christmas” like drunken strangers leaning across the bar to try and kiss you.</p><p>Agatha was getting impatient. No — she was getting feral.</p><p>Her feet hurt. Her back hurt. Her soul hurt. Her patience was thinning like cheap wrapping paper. And Alice and Jen were absolutely no help. Across the room they were nestled together — sweet, glowing, softly kissing — like a Hallmark card designed specifically to torture single people. Agatha wiped the counter a little too aggressively.</p><p>“For the love of…” Agatha muttered, slamming a shaker a little harder than necessary.</p><p>A couple at the bar flinched.</p><p>She didn’t even care.</p><p>She was tired — physically, mentally, and emotionally. Mostly emotionally. It was the kind of tiredness that made her question her life choices. And the longer the night stretched, the more her doubts sharpened.</p><p>Maybe Rio wasn’t coming.</p><p>Maybe she’d had second thoughts.<br/>
Maybe Agatha had pushed too hard, leaned too close, teased too much, tried too obviously to fluster her. Why would anyone want to spend Christmas night with someone who had a talent for making them flustered, awkward, and pink every time they met?</p><p>Maybe Rio had finally realized Agatha was too much. Too blunt. Too loud. Too everything. Maybe she’d thought about it all day and gone:</p><p><em>No. Let’s not spend Christmas with the chaotic bartender who stares at me like I’m a puppy she saw at a window of a pet shop.</em></p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened. Her throat felt warm in a bad way.</p><p>Forget it.<br/>
It was probably over before it ever started.</p><p>She told herself she didn’t care.<br/>
She told herself she shouldn’t care.</p><p>But as she handed someone a pine-leaf Mojito that smelled like a forest fire, Agatha felt the sinking knowledge settle in her stomach:</p><p>She really, really did. She turned back to a tray of half-finished drinks, rubbing tired circles under her eyes with her knuckles.</p><p>But then like Santa slid down the chimney at midnight. The bar door creaked open again.</p><p>Agatha’s head snapped up before she could stop herself — a little too fast, like her neck had its own hopeful agenda.</p><p>A colder gust this time.<br/>
Longer.<br/>
Like whoever was standing there hadn’t quite convinced herself to step inside.</p><p>Her heart thudded once again, bright and stupid. </p><p>Rio stepped in, glasses fogged at the edges, resting crookedly on her nose. Her hair was pulled back in a low ponytail — low-effort, but somehow neater than usual — with a couple of strands escaping to frame her face. A red Christmas hat sat slightly askew on her head, like she’d put it on while jogging. The forest-green coat, black sweater, and faded jeans were simple. Too simple to make sense of how completely Agatha’s heart flustered in her chest. </p><p>Rio looked around, scanning the chaos, until her eyes met Agatha’s — and lit up. Not just brightened. Lit up. </p><p>And then she moved. Cutting her way through the crowd with frantic determination, like she was Moses parting a sea of drunk undergrads.</p><p>“Hi,” Rio greeted, breathless, like she really <em>had</em> sprinted.</p><p>“Hi,” Agatha echoed.</p><p>Now that she was close, Agatha got a proper look at Rio’s sweater. A red demon — horns, pointed tail, a Santa hat — reading through a pile of letters. One of Rio’s glorious, bizarre creations.</p><p>“Satan Claus,” Agatha said, impressed.</p><p>Rio let out a laugh — a little proud, a little shy, and absolutely the most precious sound Agatha had ever heard.</p><p>“How is the top?” Rio asked, then immediately winced. “Top? I mean the shirt, um… I mean the night? How’s the night?”</p><p><em>Waiting for you was painful</em>, Agatha nearly said.</p><p>Instead she leaned an elbow on the bar, feigning nonchalance, even though she was aware — <em>painfully aware</em> — of Rio’s eyes lingering on her. Agatha had intentionally braved the freezing New England night in a purple camisole and skinny black jeans, the only Christmas spirit on her body being an Elf hat with a stupid bell. Rio’s gaze flicked from Agatha’s bare shoulders… to her tattoos… to her collarbone… and then jerked away, like she’d caught herself staring.</p><p><em>Totally</em> worth it.</p><p>“It’s busy,” Agatha said, enjoying every second of Rio’s malfunction. “How’s yours?”</p><p>Rio stood there stiffly, unsure what to do with herself — like a robot that hadn’t downloaded the new update yet. Her mouth opened. Closed. Opened again.</p><p>“Rio?” Agatha asked, waving a hand in front of her. “Are you having a stroke?”</p><p>“Uh…” Rio managed.</p><p>“Dude, come on,” someone behind her complained.</p><p>“Yes! Sorry!” Rio jolted forward and shuffled out of line.</p><p>“I don’t mind watching you glitch all night,” Agatha said, amused, “but there are people waiting. I saved your seat.”</p><p>Rio turned to where Agatha pointed — the familiar bar stool, empty except for the little purple orchid she’d brought yesterday.</p><p>Something warm flickered across Rio’s face.</p><p>“Thanks,” she murmured, scrambling out of her coat and dropping onto the stool with her usual graceless charm. She adjusted her glasses, then held up the orchid delicately between two fingers. “Hey, you kept it.”</p><p>“Of course,” Agatha said softly. “Why wouldn’t I?”</p><p>“What do you want? The usual?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Yes, please,” Rio said, then immediately tucked her head into her arm, fiddling with her hat as if trying to hide the smile sneaking onto her face.</p><p>Agatha laid out the ingredients with a flourish, letting muscle memory take over. She snapped the shaker open with a twist, juggling the gin bottle and the tin in a little showy rhythm. She poured the gin from high in the air, syrup next, then squeezed a lime in one practiced motion.</p><p>Rio was already watching like Agatha had personally invented gravity.</p><p>Agatha tossed a handful of ice up — too high, almost cocky — and it rained neatly into the shaker. A couple of customers nearby clapped, but Rio was the one she felt the most. Those bronze eyes tracked every motion like she was a kid at her first circus.</p><p>The song changed overhead — <em>Feliz Navidad</em> — and Agatha rolled her shoulders and started shaking to the beat: flick-wrist, twist-hips, toss, catch behind her back. The tin thumped rhythmically against her palms.</p><p>“Wow!” Rio breathed, leaning forward like she might climb over the counter.</p><p>“You like it, huh?” Agatha teased.</p><p>“You’re… very good,” Rio said, cheeks pink. “Do you do this to every customer?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said, smirking as she uncapped the shaker. “Only the cute ones.”</p><p>Rio instantly hid half her face behind her hands. “Uhm.”</p><p>Agatha poured the drink, enjoying Rio’s flustered silence.</p><p>Finally, Rio scraped up whatever brain cells had survived the flirting and said, “Did you know ‘Feliz Navidad’ was written in 1970?”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Really? I always thought it was, like, buried in ancient Christmas scrolls or something.”</p><p>Rio perked up, relieved to be on familiar ground. “Yeah. José Feliciano wrote it in 1970. He was the first person to bring the U.S. national anthem into the Billboard Hot 100.”</p><p>“Very interesting. Very patriotic,” Agatha said with a dramatic nod. “I’ll remember that for the next Fourth of July.”</p><p>Rio laughed — soft, embarrassed, delighted — and Agatha felt it like a warm hand slipping under her ribs. Rio’s whole face glowed, shiny and bright like a sudden sunbeam on a gray Cambridge winter. Agatha had the maddening urge to cup those soft cheeks, pull her in by the collar, and kiss those cherry-red lips until the world dissolved into tinsel.</p><p>“My abuelo loved him,” Rio said.</p><p>“Who?” Agatha asked, careful to keep her voice steady.</p><p>“José Feliciano,” Rio replied. “He used to listen to him all the time. My parents left me with him when they were at work.” Her expression softened into something warm and private. “He told me stories about growing up in Puerto Rico, how he met my abuelita, how he bought and restored his first car. Sometimes we just sat in the living room listening to music or watching TV.”</p><p>Rio traced the rim of her glass. “The best part was… he didn’t expect anything from me. I didn’t have to talk. Didn’t have to explain how I felt. I just had to sit with him.”</p><p>“He sounds like a wonderful man,” Agatha said gently.</p><p>“He was.” Rio took a sip of her drink, eyes distant with memory. “I remember sitting on his lap on the porch while he played Feliciano’s records. Something about the music just… grabbed me. The way Feliciano expressed melody was different from everyone else. Probably because he was blind.”</p><p>“How so?” Agatha asked, genuinely curious.</p><p>“Well… he couldn’t see,” Rio explained, “so his brain processed music differently. People who can’t rely on visual input use sound in richer ways. I think I loved him for that.”</p><p>“You liked him because his brain worked differently,” Agatha said. “Like yours?”</p><p>Rio’s ears went a little pink. “Yeah. I guess so. Because the first words I ever spoke were ‘I like it,’ after listening to Feliciano.”</p><p>That image hit Agatha right in the chest — tiny Rio with pigtails, turning very seriously to her abuelo to announce her verdict on José Feliciano. A small, earnest creature with too-big brown eyes and too-big feelings. Agatha wanted a little Rio of her own, or, hell, a grown-up one who kept stumbling into her bar with a tooth gap smile.</p><p>“Two beers.” Someone yelled. </p><p>Agatha blinked, reality snapping back. “Sorry!!! Duty calls.”</p><p>“No problem,” Rio said, lifting her glass in a small toast. “I’ll be right here. Not going anywhere.”</p><p>Agatha smiled — the soft, private kind — and turned away to pour the beers.</p><p>And the whole time she worked, she felt it:</p><p>The glow in her chest, the heat under her skin, and the steady knowledge that when she turned back around, between all the chaos…</p><p>Rio would still be there.</p><p>The night went on with Agatha bouncing between serving drinks and drifting back to Rio like she was tethered by a soft, invisible string.</p><p>She learned all kinds of little things about her.</p><p>Rio’s favorite snack was Sour Patch Kids — shocking no one.</p><p>“I was once so stressed about a deadline I ate an entire large bag by myself,” Rio confessed. “I threw up after.”</p><p>“Was it worth it?” Agatha arched a brow.</p><p>“I got the next day off.” Rio shrugged.</p><p>Agatha laughed. <em>Of course</em>.</p><p>Rio also played basketball.</p><p>“I sometimes ask my opponent to give me the ball,” Rio said earnestly.</p><p>“Using the puppy-eyes tactic?”</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>“It would definitely work on me,” Agatha teased — and Rio’s shy laugh was warm enough to melt the ice in the shaker.</p><p>And Rio learned things about Agatha too.</p><p>“I have six brothers and four sisters,” Agatha said while slicing a lime. “One set of twins. Eleven of us in total.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “Your mother must have the patience of a saint.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t call her a saint. She calls it her ‘God-given duty.’ I’m the one who watches the little ones most of the time.”</p><p>“I can’t imagine having that many siblings. My mom was exhausted with just me.”</p><p>“But you said you don’t do much.”</p><p>“Too much or too little going on is equally bad,” Rio said. “She was always afraid I’d forget to tell her when I needed to eat or drink.”</p><p>“You still forget to eat and drink. People have to remind you.” Agatha pointed at Rio’s empty glass. “Case in point.”</p><p>Rio looked at it. “Good point. Can I have another?”</p><p>“See?” Agatha smirked.</p><p>After fueling another round of tequila for six-pack Santa and his ho-ho-horrible reindeer friends heading onstage, she returned to Rio, who was now finishing her second Gimlet. When she looked up and saw Agatha, her face split into a lazy, delighted smile.</p><p>“Hey, welcome back!” Rio cheered, waving a little too enthusiastically.</p><p>“Santa needed fuel.”</p><p>“Bio…” Rio hiccup-laughed. “Diesel.”</p><p>“Are you drunk?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“No, I am <em>not</em>.” Rio dismissed the accusation with a dramatic wave. “I can tell you the square root of a random number in two seconds.” Suddenly her eyes sharpened, bright and mischievous. “If I get it right, you have to drink with me.”</p><p>“Rio…”</p><p>“Come on. Just give me a number!”</p><p>“Fine. Four thousand… seven hundred and sixty-one.”</p><p>“Sixty-nine,” Rio said instantly, smirking. “Hehehe.”</p><p>“What?” Agatha pulled out her phone, typed it in, and stared. “That’s… correct. But really? What are you, twelve?”</p><p>“If I were twelve I would laugh at <em>six-seven</em>, not <em>six-nine,</em>” Rio made the hand gesture. Then she leaned in on her elbows, giving Agatha a look that should have been illegal. “I won. Now you have to pay up.”</p><p>“Don’t flatter yourself, cowboy.” Agatha put down two shot glasses. “Whiskey okay?”</p><p>“Anything’s fine,” Rio said softly, watching her pour. “As long as it’s with you.”</p><p>The sudden confidence in Rio — the low, steady tone — sent a shiver up Agatha’s spine. So <em>this</em> was Rio when a little alcohol didn’t immediately knock her out. A little reckless. A little bold. And absolutely irresistible.</p><p>“Cheers.” Agatha raised her glass.</p><p>“Cheers.” Rio clinked it, downed the shot in one go, and slammed the glass down with a satisfying thud.</p><p>“Easy, cowboy.”</p><p>“I’m gonna go to the restroom,” Rio said, standing — wobbling just barely.</p><p>“Are you sure you can go by yourself?”</p><p>“Low blood pressure,” Rio explained. “Sitting too long. I’m fine.” She smiled, and as she walked off, she tossed a wink over her shoulder.</p><p>An actual wink.</p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p>Did Rio just <em>fucking wink</em> at her?</p><p>Did that mean Rio liked her? Like — <em>liked her liked her</em>?</p><p>Agatha’s brain felt like it was melting straight out of her skull. Her heart hammered against her ribcage like it was trying to escape. The tips of her ears burned. A faint ring — tinnitus or pure panic — buzzed in her head. God. She felt sixteen again, catching a glimpse of her first crush in the school hallway. She was twenty-eight, for Christ’s sake, and here she was, coming undone over a <em>wink</em>.</p><p>Agatha scrubbed her palms over her face, trying to rub the jittery warmth out of her skin. The uncontrollable smile still tugged at her lips. She started thinking — wildly, stupidly — about how she was going to ask Rio out.</p><p>Well… technically she already had. Yesterday. To her workplace, sure, but still.</p><p><em>Oh God.<br/>
This was a date.<br/>
A real date.</em></p><p><em>Did Rio know it was a date?<br/>
Why hadn’t she connected the dots sooner?<br/>
How could she be this stupid?</em></p><p>“Aggie?”</p><p>The low voice speared through her warm haze like a cold blade. Too familiar. Too heavy. The sound of Sunday mornings in church. The sound of chasing a toddler brother through the hallway to change his diaper. The sound of nightly prayers, of commandments disguised as love, of reminders to “know her place.”</p><p>Her whole body froze. She turned.</p><p>Lazarus Harkness, her brother.</p><p>“Larry?” Agatha’s voice cracked.</p><p>Ezekiel, then Lazarus, then her — the only three their parents permitted to go to school.</p><p>Ezekiel, or Zeke, the gentle one. Despite being the eldest, father never really held him in high regards. Zeke was gentle, obedient, quiet — too soft for their father’s taste. He loved books, Star Wars, anything that let him escape. He was nice, always avoided the fighting and sometime would sneak Agatha some of his secret sci-fic books or comic. The day he enlisted in the Marines, their father called it “the first brave thing he’s ever done.” </p><p>Lazarus, though…</p><p>Larry was the chosen one. Their father’s perfect replica. Strong, charismatic, top of his class, obsessed with scripture. He believed Agatha’s education was a sin and followed her around school to make sure she“behaved righteously.” Their father leaned on him for everything. Asked his opinions. Took him to sermons. Let him say grace at meals. Trusted him to keep the family “in order” when he was away. His perfect heir, the one that would carry and guide her family to God’s intended path.</p><p>Agatha still remembered the day he hit Zeke for reminding him he was younger — claiming “seniority doesn’t matter when your elder brother is a tainted coward.”</p><p>And now he stood inches away from her — older, sharper-jawed, more like their father than ever. His already-darkened hair was even darker. His stare burned through her like judgment itself. A thin scar cut across his forehead. Her wrist throbbed with the memory of the day he dragged her out of Lionel’s house. The day he tried to drag her home, trying to drag her back into the cage. The day she ran.</p><p>“What… what are you doing here?” Agatha managed.</p><p>Larry stepped closer, eyes raking over her like she was filth on the floor.</p><p>“You really have the <em>nerve</em> to look surprised.”he scoffed. “What are <em>you</em> doing here? Dressed like that? Have you even looked at yourself?”</p><p>“What I look like is none of your business,” Agatha forced out, keeping her voice steady. “Do you want anything? If not, leave.”</p><p>“Oh, listen to you. Big voice now. Big city girl.” Larry laughed once, bitter.. His eyes swept over her outfit, dripping with disgust.. “I always knew you’d shame us one day. But this? Never imagined <em>this</em>.” He gestured disdainfully. </p><p>“What the <em>fuck</em> do you want, Larry?” Agatha raised her voice.</p><p>He pointed a finger in her face. “Watch your mouth. You think a bar makes you grown? You’re still the same little disgrace who ran off because she couldn’t follow simple God-given rules.”</p><p>“Again, this is my <em>fucking</em> bar,” Agatha crossed her arms. “I talk how I want.”</p><p>He scoffed. “Your bar. Of course you’d be proud of owning a place like this. A pit where men get drunk and women throw themselves around like animals. No wonder the air feels rotten.”</p><p>“Fuck off.”</p><p>He slammed his hand on the counter hard enough that glass rattled. “HEY! You don’t talk to your brother like that.”</p><p>“We’re not home,” Agatha shot back. “You don’t give orders here. What are you going to do — quote 1 Timothy 2:12 at me? Call Dad to cry about how the ‘little star’ isn’t shining bright enough for you?”</p><p>Something snapped behind his eyes.</p><p>He lunged, grabbed her by the hair, yanked her forward until her scalp burned.</p><p>“I should’ve let Dad punish you properly that night,” he hissed. “Should’ve dragged you home sooner. Should’ve beaten the devil out of you instead of letting you run off to play heathen. ”</p><p>“Let me go!”</p><p>“You think you can talk back to me? You think you can run from us? No.” His grip tightened like a shackle. “I’m taking you home. Let’s see how mouthy you are when Dad hears what you’ve turned into.”</p><p>“I said <b>let me go</b>!” Agatha caught his thumb and bent it backward — muscle memory, the escape tactic she’d used before.</p><p>Agatha twisted, caught his thumb, bent it back—</p><p>CRACK.</p><p>“AHHHH!” Larry screamed, releasing her and clutching his hand to his chest.</p><p>“Alice!” Agatha shouted, seeing the crowd stir. “Call the police!”</p><p>“You broke my fucking finger!” Larry snarled.</p><p>“Language, Larry,” Agatha said, breathless. “Not used to being hit back?”</p><p>His face twisted with pure hatred. “You fucking little whore. You think this place makes you safe? I should have killed you right at that spot years ago. I swear to God, I’ll…”</p><p>“HEY! Leave her alone!”</p><p>Rio’s voice — sharp, loud, furious — cut through the bar like lightning.</p><p>“What is this? Your little dyke guard dog?” Larry sneered, his gaze snapping to Rio like he’d found a new thing to break. “Heel, boy!”</p><p>“Don’t talk to her like that!” Agatha warned.</p><p>“What are you going to do, little puppy?” Larry taunted, voice dripping with mockery.</p><p>Rio stepped forward, eyes razor-focused, cold as steel. She grabbed a half-empty glass from the nearest table and flung the contents straight into Larry’s face. The slap of the splash was loud enough to make a few people jerk back. He froze, stunned, water dripping from his chin. And before Larry could process, Rio’s knuckles landed directly on his nose, stumbling him. </p><p>“That,” Rio said, voice flat and deadly, standing squarely in front of him. The size difference between them made the whole scene feel mythic — David staring up at a very real Goliath.</p><p>The bar fell dead silent.</p><p>Then Larry’s expression snapped.</p><p>He threw a hook punch at Rio’s face, knocking her glasses off.</p><p>People gasped.</p><p>His hand then grabbed around Rio’s shirt, and with a single jerk he hauled her off the floor. Her feet dangled in the air, blood started to come out of her nose but her expression never cracked — blank, unbothered, like pain was a language she’d forgotten how to speak. Her swinging feet kicked air as he shook her once — like testing how breakable she was.</p><p>“You little piece of shit,” Larry growled, and drove another punch into her gut so hard the sound of it seemed to echo — a dull, thick crack.</p><p>Rio collapsed when he dropped her, folding over the floorboards, breath knocked clear out of her.</p><p>Agatha’s brain went white. She heard Rio choking in air, that awful strangled sound, and everything else disappeared. She tried to move toward her, but Larry was already turning, already stalking toward. Agatha backed up so fast she almost tripped. Her spine hit the shelf. Bottles rattled. Nowhere to go. His shadow loomed over her, blocking all the light. Dead end, like back then, he was going to grab her, drag her, spit on her.</p><p>Then — wood splitting.</p><p>Rio, from behind, had launched herself forward, swinging an entire chair down onto Larry’s back with a sound like a baseball bat hitting concrete.</p><p>The chair didn’t just break. It disintegrated. Splinters flew. People screamed. Larry staggered forward, stunned.</p><p>Then he spun too fast and caught Rio by the arm, yanking her forward with brutal force like she was a rag doll. She hit the shelves behind the bar so hard the entire structure shuddered. Bottles toppled, glass exploded, wood cracked. The whole shelf gave way, collapsing over her.</p><p>Rio went down under it all.</p><p>Agatha fell to her knees so fast they scraped the floor. Her hands shook violently as she dialed emergency services, the numbers blurring. She couldn’t tear her eyes away from Rio buried under broken shelves, her body still, breath shallow, face streaked with blood from the cuts she couldn’t even get up to wipe away.</p><p>She kneeled between the violent chaos of people screaming, of flesh hitting.</p><p>She couldn’t look away.</p><p>She couldn’t breathe.</p><p>Everything she wanted now was making sure Rio to be alive.</p><p align="center">___</p><p>The hospital’s lights were too bright for Agatha’s usual nights at the bar. Too different. Too cold. Too harsh. They burned her eyes. She had been staring at the nurses’ station for what felt like eternity, the image burned into her retinas. Every tiny movement from the nurses jolted her nerves. Every name called made her shoot upright in her seat like she’d been shocked. The antiseptic smell mixed with the lingering scent of iron and alcohol on her clothes turned her stomach.</p><p>Every time she blinked, Rio’s blood-covered, white face appeared behind her eyelids — still, limp, lifeless.</p><p>Her hands still held patches of dried blood from Rio’s head. Her shoulders were bare; she didn’t bother to remember grabbing her jacket. The cold bit into her, but the shaking came from something deeper than temperature. They hadn’t let her go with Rio — no family relation, no right. So Agatha sat in the waiting area.</p><p>And waited.</p><p>And waited.</p><p>And just <em>fucking</em> waited.</p><p>“Agatha!” Alice’s voice cut through the fog as she shook her shoulders. “Oh my God, you’re freezing.”</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha managed, but it was barely a voice at all.</p><p>“Here,” Alice said gently, wrapping Agatha’s forgotten coat around her shoulders. “How is she?”</p><p>“They… uhm… she…” Agatha stuttered, staring down at her own fingernails — purple from cold and stress. A hiccup hit her and suddenly hot tears streamed down her cheeks.</p><p>Alice grabbed both her hands, steadying them. “Hey. Hey, hey. It’s okay. The police took him. He’s going to spend at least a few nights behind bars with a broken thumb and nose at least. People from the bar vouched for you. He’s not going to hurt you now.”</p><p>“But he already hurt Rio,” Agatha sobbed. “That stupid girl and her stupid bravery. Why did she have to step up?”</p><p>“Shhh. It’s over now. How is she?”</p><p>“They took her for a head scan, I think.” Agatha’s voice cracked. “Oh God, Alice, you didn’t see how much blood there was. What if he broke her skull? What if something ruptured in her brain?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Alice admitted, “but I’m sure she’ll be …”</p><p>“No, it’s not fucking fine!” Agatha burst, voice echoing down the corridor. “My motherfucking brother threw her across the bar, Alice. Her head… her head…”</p><p>“Calm down. We’re in a hospital,” Alice whispered, rubbing her shoulder. “Her head didn’t smash open.”</p><p>“Oh my God! What if she died? What if I…It’s my fault, Alice, I hurt her, I…I… I…”</p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>“Don’t tell me to calm down! How am I supposed to…” </p><p>“Rio Vidal?” a nurse called.</p><p>Agatha’s breath vanished. She shot toward the nurse so fast like she wanted to bite off her head. The chairs rattled behind her.</p><p>“Are you Agatha?” the nurse asked.</p><p>“Yes. How is she? Please! Please tell me she’s okay,” Agatha begged, practically choking on the words.</p><p>“She’s awake now,” the nurse said softly. “We just took her for a CT, and we’re waiting on the results.”</p><p>Agatha’s knees weakened. Ten tons of pressure seemed to roll off her chest. She exhaled shakily — the first real breath in what felt like hours.</p><p>At least Rio was awake.</p><p>“We stitched her laceration and gave her painkillers,” the nurse continued. “She asked for you. Would you like to come in?”</p><p>“Yes. Please.”</p><p>“Alright. She’s in bed four.”</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>Agatha turned back to Alice, who was still standing frozen, hands pressed to her mouth.</p><p>“She’s alright,” Agatha said, breathless.</p><p>“Oh, thank God,” Alice sighed, sagging with relief.</p><p>“She wants me to come in,” Agatha added, wiping the tears trailing down her cheek.</p><p>“Yeah, yeah!!! Go.” Alice shoved a brown bag and Rio’s jacket into her arms. “This should be hers. Go. I’ll handle everything at the bar.”</p><p>“Okay. Thanks.”</p><p>“Call me if you need anything. Jen’s still here too. We’re not going anywhere.”</p><p>“I will. Thanks, Alice.”</p><p>“No problem. Take care.”</p><p>Agatha inhaled once — shaky, unsteady, terrified — and stepped toward Rio’s bed. </p><p>Rio was propped up on the hospital bed. A bruise had bloomed under her left eye, right along the cheekbone. A cut split her upper lip. Bandages wrapped around her forehead. Her skin was still pale, but the faintest flush was returning. When she saw Agatha walk in, she tried to smile — and immediately flinched as the muscles on her left side tugged against the bruise.</p><p>“Ouch,” Rio groaned.</p><p>“I had thought a PhD candidate must be smarter!” Agatha scolded as she hurried to her side. “He’s like twice your size.”</p><p>Rio stayed quiet, eyes down.</p><p>“You could’ve gotten yourself killed,” Agatha said, voice rising with the fear she hadn’t processed yet. “Larry once threw a kitten out the second-floor window because he didn’t like the sound it made.”</p><p>“I’m not a kitten,” Rio muttered. Her brown eyes finally met Agatha’s.</p><p>“But you’re not Superman either.” Agatha crossed her arms. “Don’t do that again.”</p><p>“Do what?”</p><p>“Jump into the fire for strangers.”</p><p>“But I didn’t do that for strangers.” Rio’s voice softened. “I did it for you.”</p><p>“Oh, Rio…” Agatha sighed, heart twisting. “It’s not worth it.”</p><p>“You were in danger. He was threatening you.” Rio blinked slowly, dreamily. “I’d say it’s worth it.”</p><p>“Is it worth getting thrown against a wall for a stranger?” Agatha pressed.</p><p>“You’re not a stranger. We’re not strangers,” Rio insisted, sounding half-asleep, half-sure. “I wouldn’t let anyone touch you.”</p><p>“Rio… are you high?”</p><p>“They gave me something for the stitches. All ten of them.” Rio pointed at her bandaged forehead.</p><p>“Yikes.” Agatha hissed sympathetically and set a paper bag on Rio’s lap. “Here. I think these are yours.”</p><p>“No, that one’s yours.” Rio held the bag out again.</p><p>“I didn’t even grab my jacket on the way here — Alice picked it up at your seat,” Agatha explained, confused.</p><p>“No, I mean… it’s your Christmas present. From <em>me</em>.”</p><p>“Rio…” Agatha hesitated, warmth already blooming under her ribs. “You really didn’t have to.”</p><p>“Open it,” Rio urged, practically vibrating on the bed — whether from the meds or excitement Agatha couldn’t tell.</p><p>So Agatha opened it.</p><p>Inside was a purple hoodie with a sand-and-white fluffy chubby rabbit on the front. And beside it, a jar of strawberry jam and one of peanut butter along with a cup of tea.</p><p>“Rio…” Agatha’s voice cracked. She’d mentioned her favorite animal once. Just once. Her chest tightened around the hoodie as tears stung behind her eyes. “Really, you shouldn’t—”</p><p>Before she could finish, Rio grabbed her by the collar and pulled her in with surprising strength for someone who’d been unconscious an hour ago. Their lips met — soft, warm, impossibly sweet. Rio’s chapstick tasted like cocoa. It was like a freshly baked butterscotch cake. The heat of her mouth swept through Agatha like stepping into a thick wool blanket in front of a fireplace with hot chocolate in hand. Tingling warmth spread through her whole body.</p><p>Agatha cupped Rio’s face with trembling fingers, careful to avoid the bruises. She’d barely parted for air and already wanted to fall back into that dizzying, addictive warmth.</p><p>“Ahem.”</p><p>Agatha jerked away like she’d been caught stealing. A doctor stood at the foot of the bed.</p><p>“Hi. I’m Dr. Strange,” he said, deadpan. “I’m here with the CT results for Ms. Vidal. I hope I didn’t interrupt anything.”</p><p>“No! No, we were just—” Agatha sputtered, catching sight of Rio sitting stiff as a statue, face going through a hundred shades of red.</p><p>“Right.” Dr. Strange lifted the film. “Nothing unusual on the scan. No bruising, no fracture.”</p><p>“She was also punched in the abdomen,” Agatha reminded sharply.</p><p>“Yes, we checked that too. Nothing serious.” He scribbled on his clipboard. “She can go home tonight.”</p><p>“Really?” Agatha lit up.</p><p>“Yes. Unless you want to spend Christmas Eve in the ER. Trust me — it’s no fun.”</p><p>“No, I want to go home,” Rio said quickly.</p><p>“Alright. I’ll start the discharge paperwork and send the report to the police. Come back if the pain is unbearable.” He paused at the curtains. “And girls? No strenuous activities. At least until the laceration heals.”</p><p>He left with a brisk, “Happy holidays!”</p><p>“Strenuous activities…” Agatha repeated under her breath. Once. Twice. Then the implication dropped like a ten-ton weight. She whipped around just in time to see Rio’s nose start bleeding.</p><p>“Shit!” Agatha grabbed tissues and dabbed at it. “Rio!”</p><p>“Strenuous…” Rio whispered, dazed.</p><p>“Don’t,” Agatha warned, pressing the tissues firmer. “Please, don’t.”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio nodded solemnly. “So… Do you want to come over?”</p><p>“How bold of you to ask.”</p><p>“Would you really leave injured-me alone on Christmas Eve?” Rio hit her with the full force of her chocolate-brown puppy eyes.</p><p>“You might have hit your head too hard,” Agatha muttered.</p><p>“No. I might have the most beautiful girlfriend in the world.” Rio blinked at her.</p><p>“Am I your girlfriend now?” Agatha laughed, incredulous. “What did they give you? I hope it never wears off.”</p><p>“So?” Rio pressed.</p><p>“Fine. I’ll come over.” Agatha squeezed her hand gently. “This might be the best Christmas ever.”</p><p>“Because of the bun–ny hoodie?”</p><p>“Debatable.” Agatha leaned in and kissed her again, light and soft. “Let’s get you home.”</p><p>Rio smiled, “Merry Christmas, Agatha.”</p><p>“Merry Christmas, <em>my pretty boy</em>.”</p>

<p><strong>Epilogue:</strong></p><p>Growing up, Rio always knew she was different.</p><p>Her parents assumed she was just shy — maybe a little slow. Socially, at least. Academically, she excelled, which reassured them enough to stop worrying about that part. But reading for <em>hours</em>, absorbing TV like oxygen, or simply sitting alone in her room wasn’t “enough” for them. Her mother kept enrolling her in clubs, teams, camps, anything with a group photo at the end. She hoped exposure would fix whatever made Rio prefer the corner seat and the quiet.</p><p>It didn’t help. If anything, it pushed Rio further inward.</p><p>Nothing ever clicked. Nothing ever felt right. Except the community garden.</p><p>Plants made sense to her. Dirt made sense. Things that grew because you gave them space, patience, sunlight, and water, then rewarded you with beautiful roses, sweet strawberries, or pumpkins the size of small planets — those were her people. They didn’t talk. They didn’t judge. They never asked her why she was quiet or why she didn’t smile at the right moments.</p><p>Rio would spend entire Saturdays outside, crouched in the soil, tracking the shadows to make sure her sunflowers got every minute of sunlight they deserved. Her mother nearly had a heart attack the day Rio came home with a sunburned-red face, a 103-degree fever, and approximately zero moisture left in her body.</p><p>But her sunflowers won first place at the summer fair.</p><p>Rio decided it was worth it.</p><p>Her dad didn’t mind her oddities as long as she stayed healthy and out of trouble. But even he expected her to act “normal” when company was around — polite, agreeable, socially acceptable. Rio tried. She really did. But words had never been her strength. They slipped out wrong, or too literal, or too blunt, leaving people laughing or confused, never understanding that she wasn’t joking.</p><p>Once, a girl invited her to a pool party.</p><p>“Why?” Rio asked. “I don’t know how to swim.”</p><p>When Rio’s aunt was expecting her third child.</p><p>“I hope that you don’t have more children. I don’t like them.” </p><p>One time mom made a new dish.</p><p>“It looks like Mr. Pebbles’s food.”</p><p>“Who is Mr. Pebbles?”</p><p>“Our class lizard.”</p><p>She even once went out for fancy pizza.</p><p>“Can I get a Coke?”</p><p>“Rio, it took me two months to get this reservation.”</p><p>“So… they don’t have Coke?”</p><p>Most of the time, she didn’t even realize she was on a date.</p><p>But that was fine. Rio didn’t like social situations anyway — too many people, too much noise, too many things her brain had to process. It drained her until she became drowsy and grumpy, which always upset someone. So when Billy begged her to come blow off steam after finals, she agreed only because he promised her the Rosaline amibo when it released in February. He’d definitely forget, so she recorded the promise. </p><p>While Billy was busy shaking off the last of his academic trauma, Rio was relieved to find the bar counter empty — no one would try to sit next to her while the DJ was losing his mind. She put on her headphones, blocking what she could. The music still rattled her ribs, but at least she could breathe.</p><p>She was zoning out, counting the seconds until Billy collapsed, when she saw <b>her</b>.</p><p>Ink winding over warm skin.</p><p>A white streak cutting through her bangs.</p><p>Eyes the color of deep water.</p><p>Movements fluid, effortless, like she was made of sound.</p><p>A smile that glowed even in dim light.</p><p>A voice soft enough to melt Rio’s bones when she teased her with gentle endearments.</p><p>Rio instantly regretted wearing a Tea-rex T-shirt.</p><p>Her brain short-circuited. Words stopped having meaning. She forgot how sentences worked.</p><p>And then the woman asked about Rio’s newest obsession — ANC technology. A key slipping into the perfect lock. Suddenly Rio was talking and talking. Words poured out of her, excited and clumsy, until she realized she might have overshared. But the woman only laughed, satisfied, delighted. </p><p>God, her laugh. Rio wanted to record it and play it forever.</p><p><b>Agatha</b>.</p><p>Her name was <b>Agatha</b>.</p><p>Agatha, who stood listening to Rio cry about dying plants.</p><p>Agatha, who never once made her feel repetitive or annoying.</p><p>Agatha, who tried to guess every ridiculous pun on Rio’s shirts.</p><p>Agatha, who crafted new drinks just so Rio could try them.</p><p>Agatha, who made conversations feel… safe.</p><p>Agatha, who called her a pretty boy and made Rio’s heart somersault.</p><p>Agatha, who lowered the harsh stage lights for her comfort.</p><p>Agatha, who kept Rio’s scratched glasses like a treasure.</p><p>She’d been hopelessly smitten from the first moment she saw her. Rio liked Agatha.  </p><p>Maybe too much.</p><p>Because even in her dreams, Agatha appeared — the tarot tattoo over her heart, the spider on her arm, the soft white strand framing her face. Rio doodled Agatha’s name in her notebook when she should’ve been calculating standard deviations. She imagined running her fingers through Agatha’s hair while checking on Phoebe the banana tree. </p><p>Her friends noticed, of course. And thanks to Billy’s legendary ability to keep a secret, they literally carried her by her arms and legs to Agatha’s place — and somehow lured Agatha to Rio’s lab.</p><p>Traitors.</p><p>Traitors she might someday thank.</p><p>Because talking to Agatha that afternoon — more than she’d spoken the entire semester — felt right. Natural. Right. Stories spilled out as if they’d been waiting for Agatha’s hands to catch them. Memories unspooled like a thread finally free.</p><p>Rio realized she wasn’t just crushing.</p><p>Rio had fallen in love with Agatha. </p><p>So she spent all of December 24th drawing rabbits for the gift she wanted to give. Rabbits with carrots, rabbits with cakes, rabbits mid-hop and mid-nap. Black rabbit, white rabbit. When she finished, she begged Herb at the print shop to make the shirt before he left for his date. Years of loyal business had their perks.</p><p>But of course, things didn’t go as she planned. Agatha was busier than anticipated — didn’t people have families to visit on Christmas?</p><p>And courage… courage was something Rio had never had much of. She told herself she’d wait for the alcohol to help. Then panicked when it did.</p><p>But the moment she heard Agatha’s cry — sharp with pain — adrenaline drowned every fear. Her fist connected with the man’s nose before she even realized she’d moved. Pain bloomed in her abdomen as she hit the ground, curling in on instinct, but her thoughts were only of Agatha.</p><p>He was going after her.</p><p>Rio had to stop him.</p><p>Had to protect her.</p><p>Her body moved. Her mind shut down.</p><p>When she woke, antiseptic filled her nose. Bandages tugged at her skin. Her face stung. Her stomach twisted. Blood tasted like iron at the back of her throat.</p><p>But none of it mattered.</p><p>The only thing she cared about was—</p><p><b>Agatha.</b></p><p>So she took the chance the moment she saw Agatha again.<br/>
The drugs, the alcohol, the adrenaline — they all blurred together in her bloodstream, a cocktail of courage she normally didn’t have. But she didn’t care. All she cared about was the way Agatha’s face lit up when she unwrapped the gift, clutching it to her chest like it was something precious. That smile — soft, stunned, overflowing with joy — hit Rio harder than any drink she’d had tonight.</p><p>She wanted to see that smile for the rest of her life.</p><p>Before fear could crawl up her throat, before hesitation could take back the moment, Rio moved. Her bruised back screamed, her ribs protested, but she ignored it all. Her hand grabbed on to Agatha’s coat — instinct, gravity, need — and she tugged her close like she was the only solid thing in a world that kept spinning.</p><p>And then she kissed her.<br/>
Hard. Desperate. Certain.</p><p>Agatha froze, breath catching, and Rio’s heartbeat went feral, but she didn’t pull back. Not this time. She was done running from what she felt. She was done pretending the universe hadn’t already chosen this woman for her.</p><p>Rio had always been terrible at making decisions. But as Agatha’s hands came up to cradle her face and the world softened into something warm and right.</p><p>Rio knew, without a doubt, this was the first choice she’d ever gotten completely, gloriously right.</p><p>Now, Rio was snuggled up with Agatha on the couch like she was trying to merge into her ribcage. Gravity, pain meds, and pure lesbian yearning had all teamed up to make Rio basically a warm, affectionate barnacle. Her whole body draped across Agatha’s, cheek pressed against her chest where she could feel the soft, steady thump of her heartbeat. The kind of heartbeat that made her eyelids heavy and her soul unclench.</p><p>Agatha smelled like peace, like lavender and sea-salt and something Rio’s brain had officially labeled as safe. Their legs were tangled together beneath the blanket, and the heat between them had Rio wondering for the fiftieth time how she ever survived a winter without this woman.</p><p>A plastic Christmas tree — a tragic, four-foot-tall one — stood proudly in the corner, decorated with pipette tips like sad little icicles and syringes. Above the kitchen hung a garland made entirely of stretched-out lab gloves, the fingers waving gently whenever someone walked by, like a row of disembodied jazz hands cheering them on. On the window, a string of multicolored bulbs glowed behind centrifuge cylinders Rio had lovingly converted into terrible, crooked lanterns, each one throwing uneven, rainbow shadows across the room. Two mugs of hot chocolate sat on the table — Agatha’s topped with ridiculous amounts of marshmallows because Rio insisted she deserved it.</p><p>They were playing Mario Kart. Or rather, Agatha was playing Mario Kart. Rio was supervising. </p><p>“You know,” Rio murmured, tracing idle circles on Agatha’s stomach, “we could switch to two-player mode…”</p><p>“Nope,” Agatha said, selecting a character with intense concentration, settling for Nabbit, who was purple and rabbit, two of Agatha’s favorite things, behind Rio, “You’re too good. Let me have my warm-up arc.”</p><p>Agatha kissed the top of her head — soft, effortless — and Rio’s brain just… blue-screened.</p><p>“Whatever keeps you laying here,” Rio said, shamelessly nuzzling closer.</p><p>The last few days felt unreal — like she’d stumbled into a Hallmark movie. Meeting the love of her life. Protecting her. Surviving something terrifying. And now… cuddling on the couch, teaching her girlfriend Mario Kart. Rio kept waiting for someone to yell “cut!” and take it all away.</p><p>But Agatha was real. Warm. Breathing. Throwing a turtle shelf at Princess Peach.  </p><p>Agatha had stayed for that night. Of course, no strenuous activities. Even the thought of it made Rio blush so hard she got dizzy. They’d cuddled in bed (doctor-approved, according to Agatha). Agatha helped change Rio bandages, which required an embarrassing amount of encouragement and kisses. Rio chose a movie to watch — Bad Moms’ Christmas, Rio watched every Christmas, usually alone since moving out but not this year. Rio loved to see Agatha in Rio’s clothes. Agatha wore Rio’s shark shorts and the purple bun-ny hoodie she’d made, and Rio kept staring because she had never seen anything more perfect in her entire existence. Rio spent half the movie staring, imprinting every second onto her heart like a distressed baby duck. Rio wished this moment would never end. </p><p>But a joke was on her, the sound of the key and the swing of the door happened before Rio could register. Billy walked in. </p><p>“So COLD,” he announced to the entire apartment. “I brought you my mo — HOLY — WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FACE?!” He nearly fell down at the sight of Rio’s bruised face and white wrapping. </p><p>Rio barely lifted her head.</p><p>“Hi.”</p><p>“Hi, Billy!” Agatha chimed with a cheerful wave.</p><p>Billy’s eyes darted between them. “Agatha? Why are you — what is — why are you in my apartment? On my couch? Under my blanket? Touching my roommate?!”</p><p>“Taking care of my girlfriend,” Agatha said casually, scratching Rio’s back like this was completely normal.</p><p>“Your <em>WHAT</em>? I was gone for three days!!!” Billy’s jaw dropped. </p><p>“Should have gone for longer.” Rio muttered. </p><p>“What the hell, Agatha?” Billy grabbed the back of the couch, staring at Rio like she’d aged twenty years. “I leave her with you for three days and she ends up like THIS!”</p><p>“And well loved.” Rio added, snuggling deeper like living proof.</p><p>“There was a <em>small</em> … incident,” Agatha admitted, “But everything’s fine now.” She crossed the finish line in first place. “Oh! I won.”</p><p>“Well done, mi amor,” Rio whispered, lifting herself just enough to kiss Agatha softly.</p><p>Billy made a sound like a dying vacuum. “I’m going to jump into oncoming traffic. This is NOT the wholesome bonding I envisioned when I said ‘bring her food.’”</p><p>“Thank you for that by the way.” Agatha looked up at Billy. </p><p>“How long have you been HERE?” Billy asked.</p><p>“This is the second day.” Agatha answered, trying to sit up.</p><p>“Don’t move! Cozy,” Rio warned and she could feel Billy side-eye her. </p><p>“She just took her meds,” Agatha explained, brushing a lock of hair from Rio’s forehead. “I don’t want her moving too much.”</p><p>“Yeah right! She is absolutely high on painkillers.” Billy huffed, “Are you planning to stay long?”</p><p>“Maybe until the new year.” Agatha said, starting a new race, “The bar needs a new liquor shelf and cleaning.”</p><p>Billy threw his hands up, staring at the ceiling like he was asking God for a refund. “What. The. FUCK. Happened.”</p><p>“I’ll tell you later, man,” Rio sighed, waving lazily. “I’m regenerating.”</p><p>“Great!” Billy exclaimed, “I’ll go to Eddie’s place for the week. I’m not third-wheeling whatever this is.” Billy groaned dramatically and snapped a photo of them.“The girls are going to LOVE this.”</p><p>“Billy!” Rio squawked without lifting her face from Agatha’s chest.</p><p>Agatha leaned down. “Who’s Eddie?”</p><p>“His new boyfriend,” Rio whispered.</p><p>Agatha smiled. “Cute.”</p><p>“Alright you two have fun without me.” Billy scrambled out the door, “Don’t break anything while I’m gone! Kugel’s in the fridge!”</p><p>“No strenuous activities!” Agatha shouted after him.</p><p>“He SO doesn’t get it,” Rio giggled, hiding her burning face in Agatha’s hoodie.</p><p>“It’ll hit him when he least expects it.” Agatha said, tightening her arms around her. </p><p>Rio tilted her head up, heart thudding, crawling up to meet Agatha’s face, feeling Agatha’s embrace around her “Agatha?”</p><p>“Mm?”</p><p>“I love you.”</p><p>“I love you too,” Agatha whispered, kissing her like she was something fragile and precious.</p><p>And Rio decided this moment among this warmth, this woman and this safety was somewhere she could live forever.</p>
