<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>“There’s a structure to this show, Agatha.”</p>
<p>“People don’t want structure, they want to be interested enough that they stop watching someone play subway surfers in the background.”</p>
<p>“There’s interesting stuff planned!”</p>
<p>“My stuff is betterrrrrrr.” She sing-songed, twisting her chair back and forth.</p>
<p>“Doing that is gonna fuck up the audio.”</p>
<p>Agatha halted, getting dangerously close to the mic and batting her eyelashes. “Please forgive me gentle listener, Rio is a hardass who apparently doesn’t suffer from ADHD.”</p>
<p>“I will buy you a bucket of fidget spinners if you sit still.” Rio rubbed their temples.</p>
<p>“I’m not a middle school boy.” She put her elbows on the table, placing her chin in her hands. “And I can think of something better to keep my fingers occupied with,” She fucking winked again. “Thoughts?”</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Rio's podcast is beginning to fail. Views are plummeting, sponsors are sparse. Enter: new co-host Agatha who gets on their nerves and saves their show all in one fell swoop.</p></blockquote>

<p>“Now, I don’t necessarily think it’s a loss.” Rio chuckled into the microphone, elbows resting on the table and fingers mindlessly twirling around cords. “She’s a dumb twenty-something and I don’t even understand why she’s famous in the first place. But if she’s no longer identifying as a lesbian to date some crusty man twice her age, all I can say is: Good luck, babe!”</p><p>They heard Alice, their producer, snicker off to the side, chunky headphones rooted over her wolf cut. Rio tucked their tongue against their cheek. “As per usual, witches, it’s been another great episode. I look forward to dissecting more infighting next week. With that, this has been <i>My Pretty Little Coven</i> with me, Rio Vidal. Until next time, tiny gays who live in my phone.”</p><p>Alice clicked a few buttons, cutting the audio and turning off the camera. “Aaaaand, we’re out.”</p><p>Rio scrolled on their laptop as the box lights turned off, leaving just the warmth of the few lamps she had strewn around the studio. Their podcast was by no means the biggest under Lilia’s media conglomerate, but it was steady, filling in the gen z/millennial gay niche in the market. “Did Jinkx’s people ever get back to us about coming on?”</p><p>Alice smiled, one of pity and discomfort. “Um, she passed…for Hot Ones.”</p><p>“God damnit! Again?! That motherfucker looks like Mr. Clean…” Rio groaned. “But less buff!”</p><p>“It’s okay, we’ll find someone else.”</p><p>“How?! My views are plummeting every month and Lilia is breathing down my neck.” They slumped in their chair. “I’m gonna get fired and this set is going to be repurposed for a fucking frat bro red pill podcast sponsored by Barstool!”</p><p>Alice rounded the desk, hopping atop. “Okay, chill the fuck out. Times are tough, people aren’t spending money how they used to-”</p><p>“Oh, so that’s why sponsors are pulling out?” Rio rolled their eyes. “Not even BetterHelp wanted to spend money on us and that scam promotes shit everywhere.”</p><p>“It’s been a slow couple months, sure.”</p><p>“<i>Seven</i> months. Seven! Lilia’s gonna axe us.”</p><p>“No, she won’t. We just need to get creative.”</p><p>“We’re circling the fucking drain.”</p><p>“Not helpful!”</p><p>“I’m going to have to live off the TikTok creator fund.” Rio deadpanned, running their hands through their hair. “I’m going to have to depend on horny, lonely lesbians watching me do plant tours while ‘accidentally’ in my boxers and sports bra with my abs showing. I’m gonna be a piece of dyke meat-”</p><p>“Calm the fuck down.” Alice furrowed her brows, tilting her head. “I <i>have</i> been thinking about a solution. You’ll hate it, but it’s worth exploring.”</p><p>“And what’s that?”</p><p>“New blood.”</p><p>“Like…?”</p><p>“A co-host.”</p><p>“Aliiiiice-”</p><p>“Hear me out,” She threw her hands up in defense, legs idly swinging. “We get someone who appeals to our current base and brings in a new one.”</p><p>Rio shook their head. “I don’t play well with others. This is <i>my</i> show and I’ve worked my ass off to get here.”</p><p>“That won’t matter if our lights get shut off. And we have ZocDoc until next week.” Alice shot back. “Also, I’d really rather not go back to working security at Hot Topic, it was fucking bleak dude.”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“I’ve been gathering data, scouring the internet…”</p><p>“You’ve been stalking lesbians on the internet.” Rio deadpanned, pushing back their chair and standing, closing their laptop. “Whoever you’ve found, I’m not interested. We don’t even have the budget for another person right now, let alone you and me.”</p><p>“Okay, but, I have a lead-”</p><p>They shuffled over, crossing the threshold of the set that was basically just a beige room with some old furniture. “I don’t want a tweeny bopper baby gay repeating brain rot over me.”</p><p>Alice followed after, pleading her case. “She’s not! She's twenty-six, so only a few years younger than you. A million followers on Tiktok, 100K on Insta, she has a Patreon and a Twitch! And most importantly, a steadily growing audience!”</p><p>“Doing what?” They whipped around, baggy jeans swishing around as they did so. “Who’d you find?”</p><p>“Agatha Harkness, or well,” Alice corrected herself. “<i>MotherHarkness</i> on all her socials.”</p><p>They scrunched their nose, grimacing. “Mother?”</p><p>“Hey,” She threw up her arms. “It works.”</p><p>“Didn’t she get into some beef a year back with a skinfluencer?” Rio winced at the use of the term ‘skinfluencer’ as if it were a real word.</p><p>“Yes, but nothing major.”</p><p>“Do I have to?”</p><p>“You wanna keep your show?”</p><p>“Fine.” Rio sulked, crossing their arms. “I’ll get in touch with Lilia, you reach out to <i>Mother</i> Harkness, and we’ll set up a preliminary meeting.”</p><p>“You’ll thank me for this one day.”</p><p>Rio grabbed their jacket, tucking their computer under their arm and throwing on their sunglasses. “I highly doubt that.” And took off out the exit, being greeted with the air of a New York spring.</p><p>They had tried LA, fucking loathed it, so when they had a decent enough following, they made the move to NYC. It was better here, more pessimistic and jaded than the vapid and over-tanned populous of California. Rio made the short walk from the studio to their apartment, climbing the five flights of stairs since the elevator had been out of commission since the day they moved in three years ago.</p><p>Rio’s content mostly revolved around being an attractive plant lesbian in the city, dumb as fuck but it paid the bills, <i>generously</i> at that. The degree they had earned in pre-veterinary science had collected dust since Rio was too burnt out to actually finish the additional four years of schooling and training needed to be an actual vet. They threw their laptop and keys on the microscopic dining table of their kitchenette, bending down and immediately scooping up the void of black fur and bright green eyes.</p><p>“Hello, my baby.” Rio murmured to their cat, Victoria. “Did you have a better day than me?”</p><p>She blinked up at them, purring happily and obliviously.</p><p>“I bet, huh? You probably moved from the bedroom all the way to the couch.” They cradled her head, kissing between her eyes. “You’re so smart.”</p><p>Rio placed her down, the soft <i>jingle</i> of her collar being heard right after. They grabbed their laptop as they flopped onto the couch, Victoria curling against their side as they begrudgingly typed up and sent an email to Lilia. The next several hours of the day being spent tracking data analytics, connecting with potential sponsors, and streaming on Twitch. All and all, not a hard day's work.</p><p>A week later, Rio sat in the studio, gearing up to record another show and awaiting the arrival of this mystery dyke. They had done some retcon on Agatha Harkness, notoriously unserious ragebaiter and most definite scammer. She was one of those witchy lesbians who sold spells on Etsy for fifty bucks a pop, was always promoting some bullshit that nobody needed, and was generally just <i>really fucking hot</i>. Rio had eyes, they could appreciate beauty when they saw it.</p><p>“She’s twenty minutes late.” Rio chided, twirling around in their desk chair. “I took a potential pay cut to fund her as a trial guest host, and she’s late?!”</p><p>The sound of boots storming in punctuated the end of Rio’s sentence, Agatha whirling in like a god damn tornado, all hair and piercingly blue eyes. She had on jeans and this lacy black tank top that revealed a healthy amount of cleavage. “Who’s late?”</p><p>They shot up, giving her a once over. “You’re shorter than I thought you’d be.”</p><p>Agatha raised her chin in defiance, lips puckered with attitude as she teasingly asked “You think about me?”</p><p>“I- uh, well…” They cleared their throat, stepping out from behind the desk and extending their hand. “Sorry, that was rude. I’m Rio.”</p><p>“I know.” She said, placing down a small rectangular mesh bag. “And if you simply <i>must</i> know,” Agatha bent over, unzipping it and pulling out a ball of brown and white fluff. “Scratchy’s grooming appointment ran late and I didn’t have time to drop him off back at home.”</p><p>Rio grinned, delicately reaching a limp hand towards the bunny, letting him sniff before accepting their soft pet atop his head. “He’s adorable.”</p><p>“I know that too.” Agatha purred, eyes lidding ever so slightly. “So please excuse my tardiness, <i>Rio</i>.”</p><p>Why the fuck did her saying their name make their mouth go dry?</p><p>“It’s- it’s okay.” Rio’s hand dropped from the rabbit after the briefest contact with Agatha’s. “We already have everything set up, so this show is just a test run. See if it flows well, if you resonate with viewers, if our chemistry is good.”</p><p>“Good?” She husked. “Palpable, even?”</p><p>“I see why you have a legion of lesbians at your disposal.” Rio quipped, hoping they weren’t blushing.</p><p>“I prefer army.” Agatha winked, placing Scratchy back in his carrier, whispering a few words of comfort as she zipped it closed. “And I don’t think I could make your pod <i>worse.</i>”</p><p>“What’s that mean?”</p><p>“Ah, just that it’s kind of…out of touch.”</p><p>Rio tilted their head in defense. “How so?”</p><p>“I hadn’t even heard of it until your producer reached out, and we live in the same parts of the internet.” She said, confident and precise. “See, you recycle the same topic that’s already been talked about for the past forty-eight hours and by that time, it’s already stale. You need to be the person to start the conversation, not pile on once everyone has said their peace. That, and your sponsors are all over the place. No dyke I know wants Bloom shoved down their throat. Get a queer owned sex toy company or something, now <i>that</i> is something your viewers want shoved down their throats.”</p><p>“My viewers, or you?” Rio squawked, flabbergasted at the tangent the woman had just gone on.</p><p>“Mmmh,” She smirked. “Wouldn’t you like to know?”</p><p>And that time, Rio felt the heat flooding their face. “No, not like that-”</p><p>She brushed past them, flopping into the desk chair opposite theirs. “Here, yes?”</p><p>“You watched enough to know which one is my chair?”</p><p>“You think I’d agree to this without knowing what I was getting into?” Agatha muttered, adjusting the lumbar. “When this is made permanent, I expect a better mic.” She flaccidly thwacked the one already set up. “Preferably a shade of purple, specifically lilac.”</p><p>“Purple?”</p><p>“<i>Lilac.</i>” She repeated, shimmying her chair until her torso was flush with the desk. “Well?” Agatha held up her hand, flexing it in a <i>come hither</i> motion. “Chop, chop, pretty boy.”</p><p>Jesus fuck, Rio nearly buckled.</p><p>Rio’s eyes slowly slid over to Alice, already sitting with her headphones on and clearly trying to hold back a laugh. “Go on…<i>pretty boy.</i>”</p><p>They took their seat, blowing out a sharp breath as they rolled their shoulders back, ignoring the snickering of the woman next to them. Alice gave them a cue, recording going and camera rolling. “Welcome back, witches. We are here with another episode, this time, with special guest Agatha Harkness.” They looked over at her, leaning back in her chair, one leg tucked up and spread.</p><p>She mocked an expression of surprise, “Moi?”</p><p>“Otherwise known to feral queer women as ‘Mother’.”</p><p>“If the moniker fits…” She grinned brightly. “Happy to be your honored co-host, Vidal.”</p><p>Their laptop sat open in front of them, talking points displayed on the screen. “Trial co-host…” Rio muttered.</p><p>“Did you see the video of the girl who announced her pregnancy to ChatGPT first?” Agatha asked as if that were a real segue. “It came across my fyp last night and-”</p><p>“What?!” They cocked their head, trying to follow this flow of conversation. “The AI program?”</p><p>“Yeah!” She slammed her hands down on the table. “Imagine telling your child one day that you were so deep in your psychosis, you told a robot about your pregnancy. How the fuck did anyone ever knock her up if she’s spending <i>so</i> much time with ChatGPT, it has a personality? She’s ruining the planet for her future kid-”</p><p>“Hold on, what does this have to do with any of today’s structure?” Rio pointed to their screen in reference.</p><p>“Oh, it doesn’t.” Agatha all too sweetly said. “It just really fucking pissed me off. We’re getting to a point in society where we need a new plague, wipe out all the billionaires and dumbasses.” She pointed at the laptop. “Also, I hated all of those points. Except the one about that straight girl who said that her cis boyfriend is basically a lesbian.”</p><p>“And I’m sure you have an opinion on that too-”</p><p>“Yes, cis men should die.” She deadpanned. “But I digress-”</p><p>“There’s a structure to this show, Agatha.”</p><p>“People don’t want structure, they want to be interested enough that they stop watching someone play subway surfers in the background.”</p><p>“There’s interesting stuff planned!”</p><p>“My stuff is betterrrrrrr.” She sing-songed, twisting her chair back and forth.</p><p>“Doing that is gonna fuck up the audio.”</p><p>Agatha halted, getting dangerously close to the mic and batting her eyelashes. “Please forgive me gentle listener, Rio is a hardass who apparently doesn’t suffer from ADHD.”</p><p>“I will buy you a bucket of fidget spinners if you sit still.” Rio rubbed their temples.</p><p>“I’m not a middle school boy.” She put her elbows on the table, placing her chin in her hands. “And I can think of something better to keep my fingers occupied with,” She fucking winked again. “Thoughts?”</p><p>“Not even one day in, and you’re already sexually harassing me?”</p><p>Her arms fell forward, wrists together and ready to be bound. “You gonna punish me for it?”</p><p>“Agatha,” They rumbled, resisting the bait. “This is still harassment."</p><p>“And yet, you haven’t told me to stop.” She shot back, a victorious smile gracing her beautiful face. “Tell me to stop, handsome.”</p><p>Rio choked, quite literally, on their own spit. Rolling back from the mic and hacking up a lung for a full minute, fighting to gain their composure. They settled, glaring at Alice as they spoke “Anyway, let’s get into today’s topics.”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha snorted, looking at the camera knowingly. “Let’s.”</p><p>Yeah, they didn’t get through basically any of Rio’s talking points, Agatha’s tangents taking precedent every single time. It was the first time Rio had gone over their own self scheduled recording time. Usually the pod was an hour, the show with Agatha being nearly two. She didn’t stop interrupting or fidgeting, purposefully saying inflammatory shit, some borderline offensive. Most of it actually awed Rio, to hear someone say that kind of stuff without fearing the consequences.</p><p>“TERFs are the weakest link in the queer community,” Agatha rambled, Rio not even remembering how they landed on this topic. "How are you going to hate the people who got you your rights to begin with?”</p><p>“That’s the question you have for TERFs?” They rhetorically asked, resolution broken down near minute one hundred and five.</p><p>“No, actually,” Agatha looked dead into the lens. “Have you ever considered self-harm? I think you’d thrive at it.”</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio chided, locking eyes with Alice to start wrapping things up. “I think that’s a solid end to the show today. Thank you for listening, as always this has been <i>My Pretty Little Coven</i>, with me, your host, Rio Vidal-”</p><p>“And Agatha Harkness.” She interjected.</p><p>Rio tucked their tongue against their cheek, huffing “See you next time, witches.”</p><p>Alice shot up a thumbs up, yelling “We’re good.”</p><p>“What the hell, Agatha?” They snapped their laptop shut. “Alice is going to have to edit that into something usable!”</p><p>She got up, cackling “That was your most compelling show in <i>months.</i>" Agatha crossed the set, picking up the carrier. “Use it, don’t use it. Either way, I get paid. Now, if you’ll excuse me, my son needs enclosure time and a snack.” She flipped her hair over her shoulder, tousled waves flourishing dramatically. “I had fun, and I’m sure your audience will thank me for pumping some life into this otherwise dull and mediocre pod. Hit me up when you’ve figured out I’m right, pretty boy.” She looked at Alice. “You know I’m right, tell them that.”</p><p>Rio watched her leave, the door closing with her disappearance. “<i>That</i> was who you stuck me with?!”</p><p>“She’s not that bad!” Alice shouted, headphones flying off her head.</p><p>“She is rude, and loud, and brash, and obnoxious!”</p><p>“Oh, and I forgot, those people never have huge audiences!”</p><p>“She’s offensive and divisive!”</p><p>“Let me edit the show, we’ll post tomorrow, and let the viewers decide. If they hate it, we blame her. If they like it, we have a solution.” Alice said, cocked her hip and crossed her arms. “ZocDoc is gone and we’re going to have to start entertaining feminine wash sponsors if we don’t get our stats up. My god, man. Cope.”</p><p>And Rio would rather die than take money form a company hellbent on fucking up women’s pH balance, so “We’re not getting her a purple mic.”</p><p>“She said lilac,” Alice shrugged. “I feel like that’s reasonable.”</p><p>The next day, Alice posted the show to Spotify and YouTube while Rio nervously waited for the views to roll in. The fanbase that loved the show were diehards, just around 125K sprawled across both platforms, with those loving ride or die fans dropping like fucking flies month after month. The final cut was an hour thirty, no ad breaks. The first hour of it being uploaded was always slow…or it <i>used</i> to be. Having Agatha’s name in the title and her face in the thumbnail must’ve drummed up engagement. It was a fluke, they were sure, closing the tab and distracting themself for a few hours by baking or playing with Victoria.</p><p>Around four, they got a call from Alice, picking up to her <i>screaming</i> “I was right! I was right! I was fucking right!”</p><p>“What?” Rio chirped, putting down the stick with feathers dangling off it for Victoria. “What the hell are you on about?”</p><p>“Have you not seen the engagement on the latest show?”</p><p>“No, I’ve been touching grass to quell my many, many anxieties.”</p><p>“Rio,” Her voice went serious, but it was laced with unbridled joy. “We’ve <i>gained</i> for the first time in seven months and traffic on the page has gone up by at least 25%.”</p><p>“Really?!”</p><p>“Really.”</p><p>“Because of Agatha?”</p><p>“They love her! The comments alone are cultish in their admiration for her and kinda creepy with the lesbians who yearn to sleep with her.”</p><p>“God-”</p><p>“Oh, there’s more.”</p><p>“No, please. No more.”</p><p>“The most commented sentiment? That they ship you and Agatha!”</p><p>Rio’s face twisted in horror. “Ship us?”</p><p>“Yeah, like want you two together-”</p><p>“I know what ‘ship’ means, I was on tumblr in 2014.” They briefly shut their eyes, taking in as much air as they could. “So what does this mean? Like long term?”</p><p>A pause of silence, then Alice’s voice. “It means, you have a new permanent co-host, and pseudo situationship.”</p><p><i>Shit.</i></p>

<p>In the one month since Agatha was made a permanent co-host on their podcast, Rio’s life had become…hectic. The growth of the show and channel was unprecedented, ballooning nearly fifty thousand subs over four weeks. Unheard of, really. Unheard of, before Agatha motherfucking Harkness. The power she wielded was <i>insane</i>, her fanbase as feral as she was. Rio didn’t hate Agatha, but holy shit, did she make them want to rip their own hair out most days.</p><p>The show had lost almost all of its original structure, Rio having given up on it around week two. They loosened their grip on the reins because the more Agatha yapped, the more people tuned in. The most compelling part of the show was Rio’s frustration building to a boiling point as Agatha worked tirelessly to see them break. They didn’t, they wouldn’t give her the satisfaction. But there were numerous compilations posted on YouTube each week with some varying titles of <i>Agatha Harkness annoying Rio Vidal for twelve minutes straight</i> or <i>Agatha flirting with Rio while they squirm for eight minutes compilation</i>. Rio didn’t watch those, even if they were tagged on Twitter over and over again.</p><p>So, four weeks later, and Rio was entertaining several sponsors, hitting and exceeding their stats, and glaring at the godforsaken lilac microphone as Agatha smiled like the cat who had just eaten the canary. Yes, Rio folded and bought her the microphone in the exact shade she had requested, buying themself a new one as well, a nice shade of sage green. Honestly, the worst part of it wasn’t Agatha, it was the fans. The shipping hadn’t ceased, it only multiplied tenfold. And sue them, Rio leaned into it because it got more engagement, Agatha leaning in too.</p><p>Alice gave them the cue, lights blinding, camera on, sound rolling. “Hi guys, welcome to another episode. Like every show, I’m Rio-”</p><p>“And I’m Agatha.” She raised her mason jar in salute, waiting for Rio to raise their own. “Clink me.”</p><p>Rio begrudging picked up their own drink, letting the glasses softly <i>clink</i> against one another. Then chuckling “Bet you’d love it if I did.”</p><p>Agatha grinned, voice sweet as honey. “Now baby, not in front of the viewers.”</p><p>They cleared their throat at the pet name, sipping their matcha instead. “What is that anyway? Looks foggy.”</p><p>“Oh!” Agatha turned to the camera, proudly displaying her glass. “This is a lemon La Croix with a <i>teeny tiny</i> little 2.4% THC packet. I considered the 5% but I thought I’d be professional today.”</p><p>“Really?” Rio deadpanned.</p><p>“Makes my sparkle shine.” Agatha narrowed her gaze at them. “And at least I’m not drinking grass like a homo and pretending to like it.”</p><p>“It’s green tea.” Rio squinted at her. “La Croix tastes like static, and you <i>are</i> a homo.”</p><p>“Oh yeah, keep degrading me.” Agatha husked, twirling a lock of her hair around her index finger. “I’m close.”</p><p>“So,” Rio sighed, pulling their laptop out. “By popular demand, we are going to be reading our comments on Twitter. I don’t have Twitter, but the pod does, we prompted you gremlins to tell us anything. Comments, questions, concerns. Our producer, Alice, then compiled a list of the most entertaining.” They furrowed their brows, logging in. “Do you have Twitter, Agatha?”</p><p>“Nope.” Agatha pursed her lips. “I got banned after telling Elon multiple times to suck my long, hard cock and gargle my massive balls.”</p><p>Rio stifled a laugh, biting their lower lip. “How’d he find out?”</p><p>“I tagged him.”</p><p>“Naturally.”</p><p>“I say it with my chest.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio clicked on the bookmarked posts that Alice had selected. “Ready?”</p><p>“Give it to me, handsome.” Agatha lowly purred straight into the mic, eyes dangerously dilated in their direction. Rio wasn’t even sure Agatha really liked them, or just flustered them for shits and giggles. “I can take it.”</p><p>“<i>Mierda.</i>” They whispered, hoping that it wouldn’t pick up on the recording. “Um, okay, right.” Rio swallowed, forcing their brain to work again. God damnit, they regretted being literate. “Alice, what the hell?”</p><p>There was the snickering of their producer bellowing faintly in the background as Agatha snatched their laptop. She raised her chin, working her jaw and reading the comment word for word. “All my holes are perfectly molded to their mics btw.”</p><p>Rio felt their face burn, no doubt blushing. “At least the worst is out of the way…?”</p><p>Lithe fingers swiped the scroll pad, Agatha’s cackle following. “Oh, not even close, sweetheart.”</p><p>They swiped the computer back, eyes focusing as they spoke “I just need Agatha to punch me in the face and for Rio to ride it better. Is that too much to ask-” They froze. “Jesus fuck, you heathens!”</p><p>“I wanna do another! Does anyone wanna ride my face?!” Agatha grabbed the screen, dragging it across the desk. “Need that lilac mic up my <i>[redacted]</i> so bad I turn into a mic stand.” Agatha chuckled, looking into the camera. “I could do it too, give me thirty minutes and a gallon of lube.”</p><p>Rio’s hands covered their face in shame. “My parents watch this…”</p><p>“Oooh! This one!” She squinted, loudly proclaiming “If Agatha and I were on the Titanic and it started sinking, my last word would be <i>gwhgabguba</i> because it’s hard to speak with her strap in my mouth.” Agatha giddily clapped. “Accurate.”</p><p>“Agatha-”</p><p>“There’s ones about us.” Agatha clicked another post. “Paris is beautiful this time of year.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Paris.” She suggestively wiggled her eyebrows.</p><p>“Yeah…?”</p><p>“Eiffel Tower, hon. Keep up.”</p><p>“That’s enough of you picking-” Rio stole the computer back, choosing a random comment. “Rio can remove my tonsil stones with their strap-” They slouched forward, heart racing erratically from enduring this humiliation ritual. “Okay, what the fuck?”</p><p>“Up to the challenge, Vidal?” Agatha tilted her head. “Fair warning, I don’t care for sharing.”</p><p>“I’m questioning so many of my life choices…” There had to be a singular non dirty comment, and so help them god, they’d find it. It took a solid minute, Agatha whipping out her phone and finding the post by creating a sock puppet account in thirty seconds flat. “Ah, okay, here.” Rio said, asking the same question the commenter had. “How do you deal with anxiety and stress?”</p><p>Agatha peered up from her phone, shrugging. “Weed and masturbation. Works better if you have a mirror.”</p><p>“A <i>mirror?</i> To watch yourself?”</p><p>“I <i>love</i> watching myself having sex with myself.” Agatha giggled, holding eye contact. “I’m very hot, beauty demands attention.”</p><p>“Why doesn’t that surprise me.”</p><p>“That’s my <i>favorite</i> person to have sex with.” She smirked, voice becoming slightly husky. “Or at least for now, who knows, could change…”</p><p>Rio’s knee bounced, breathing getting heavy. “Try exercise, kind commenter. Helps to get your heart rate up.”</p><p>“You know what else gets your heart rate up?” She quipped, hand reaching over as her fingers brushed Rio’s arm. “But that’s another video.”</p><p>“Could we please-” They squeaked, throat inexplicably dry and skin erupting with goosebumps. “Please focus on <i>this</i> video?”</p><p>“Sure.” Agatha’s hand retracted, the phantom touch lingering as she read another comment. “Need them so bad I’m putting it in my will that when I die, my ashes need to be turned into candles specifically for them to wax play with.” She nodded, a bright smile on her lips. “You guys are <i>so</i> creative.”</p><p>“This one has voting attached?” Rio muttered, reading it aloud. “Do you think Rio whimpers or cries when Agatha finally lets them slip it in? Poll here.” They harshly closed their computer. “The fuckers actually voted.”</p><p>“Well?”</p><p>“I’m not answering-”</p><p>“The poll says whimper.”</p><p>“NEITHER.”</p><p>“So you grunt?”</p><p>“<i>No.</i>”</p><p>“So you’re a bottom?” Agatha kept pressing. “How greedy of you, Vidal.”</p><p>“¡No puedo hacer esta mierda!” Rio yelled, shooting out of their chair and storming off the set. See? Boiling point.</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha called after, getting out of her chair.</p><p>They grabbed their jacket, rifling through the pockets and grabbing their cigs and a lighter before bolting out the door. They weren’t totally pissed, they just needed a minute without the goading. Rio slumped against the brick wall of the alleyway, hastily lighting the cigarette and taking a deep drag. Now that cured anxiety quite fucking well.</p><p>Agatha rounded the corner, an authentic emotion on her face for the first since Rio had known her. “Hey, what just happened?”</p><p>Rio blew out the smoke, looking at her. The short skirt, the loose off shoulder sweater she had on, the thigh-highs and docs, all perfectly manicured. They tucked their pack in the pocket of their oversized button up, stowing their lighter in the front pocket of their jeans. “I need a minute, can I please have that, or are you going to ride my dick about that too?”</p><p>“Ride your dick? You make this too easy.” Agatha snorted, leaning next to them, body facing theirs. “I’m sorry if I hurt your wittle feelings,” She pouted in faux sympathy, “But I kinda have a <i>brand</i>, one that you needed and one that Lilia pays me for. It’s all made up bullshit, why’d it bother you?”</p><p>Rio perched the cigarette between their lips, speaking through the smoke and blowing the excess through their nostrils. “It didn’t.”</p><p>“So your temper tantrum was completely spontaneous?” Agatha prodded, plucking the cigarette from their mouth and popping it into her own. “Seems legit.”</p><p>They watched as she took a drag, the way her lips curled as the smoke slipped out. “Why do you say the things you do?”</p><p>“Makes people horny or angry.” Agatha said, as though it were obvious. “And those emotions make people engage enough that I can pay rent, feed myself and Scratchy.”</p><p>“You flirt with me for money?”</p><p>“No, that part is for fun.”</p><p>Rio gulped, the information slowly digesting. “But, like, how are you <i>really?</i> As a person, I mean.”</p><p>“More or less the same.” She cocked her hip, resting her elbow on it as she ashed the cig. “Why do you care?”</p><p>“I guess I’m curious. It has to get exhausting to perform all the time…”</p><p>“There’s a way you can find out.”</p><p>“How?” Rio perked up, genuinely asking.</p><p>Agatha smiled, but it was different from the others, less synthetic. “You could ask me out.”</p><p>“Oh-” Their face fell, their posture straightening up from the wall. “You were serious about the stuff in there?”</p><p>Agatha took one last drag, her fingers settling onto Rio’s jaw. Her thumb sat on their lower lip, pressing down to encourage them to open their mouth. Rio did, without fucking question, actually. She glided into their space, mouth becoming dangerously close to theirs. Agatha exhaled all the smoke, letting it slither and coil onto Rio’s awaiting tongue.</p><p>Their eyes fluttered shut, the ghosting of her lips over theirs. Rio forced their lungs to expand, inhaling the secondhand smoke. Agatha placed the cigarette back between their lips, closing their jaw which had gone slack. She pulled back, her eyes teaming with a challenge. “Deadly.”</p><p>“Why don’t you ask me out then?” They dazedly questioned, the cigarette dropping to the pavement below.</p><p>“Ah just,” Agatha sighed, grabbing their wrist and placing their hand on her waist. “I’m <i>so</i> shy.”</p><p>“Or you like to be chased.”</p><p>“Hey, pretty boy.” She nudged their hand, letting it drop further down. “Either grab my ass and do something, or take the loss.”</p><p>Fine.</p><p>Rio closed the minimal gap, fingers splayed over the obscenely short hem of her skirt. They blindly groped at their coworker’s ass as her lips collided with Rio’s, a soft moan exiting Agatha’s mouth as it happened. She tasted like lavender and honey, whatever she had on her lips made them sticky and delicious. Rio’s free hand threaded through her hair, angling their head to deepen the kiss, their tongue running along her lower lip as she gasped, allowing them entry. They spun Agatha, firmly pressing her up against the brick, their hand disappearing <i>beneath</i> the skirt, palm resting against what felt like lace panties.</p><p>God loved Rio, that settled it.</p><p>Agatha, in turn, hooked her fingers in the belt loops of their jeans, arching into Rio’s touch, kissing them as if it were a competition she’d win. Rio didn’t care if she did, this was enough of a victory, pouring every ounce of frustration into this woman’s mouth, scraping their blunt nails along the skin of her ass hard enough to leave lines. For all of her boasting, the whine that left Agatha was almost comical.</p><p>“You gotta be fucking kidding me.” Alice’s voice cleared the fog, making Rio break off and repel themself away from the other host. Rio’s producer stood there like an NPC, only Alice held a withering judgmental stare that most NPCs would <i>not</i> be programmed with. “You know we still have a show to finish, right?”</p><p>“We were just…” Rio started, only then realizing they didn’t have an end.</p><p>Agatha fixed her skirt, swiping her bottom lip and smirking. “Partaking in some stress relief.”</p><p>“I don’t usually relieve stress with Rio’s tongue down my throat.” Alice deadpanned, hands in her back pockets.</p><p>“I should hope not.” Agatha sneered, pushing herself from the wall. “I’d burn down the fucking studio.”</p><p>“We should…” Rio muttered, starting to shuffle towards Alice.</p><p>“Like cats in heat, I swear to god.” Alice scolded, waving them both back inside.</p><hr/><p>She slumped back into her chair, reaching down into her bag and reapplying her lip oil since she had a brand deal with the company who made it. Agatha fluffed up her hair, Rio still panting in their own chair opposite from her. God, she fucking loved seeing them like that, flushed and left wanting.</p><p>“Okay, everything is still rolling, I’ll cut out Rio’s hissy fit.” Alice took her seat, grabbing her headphones. “Just make up a lie about the sudden cut that the viewers are going to see.”</p><p>“Sorry folks,” Rio smiled, the one that showed that endearing tooth gap they had. “Smoke break. Where were we?”</p><p>“You were slipping inside me.” Agatha answered, her chin resting in her hands.</p><p>“Right.” Rio squeaked, opening their laptop and continuing to find more comments. “Need mother Agatha Harkness to call me a good boy yesterday.”</p><p>“I thought you said you said you didn’t have a Twitter account…” Agatha set the trap.</p><p>“I don’t.” Rio scrunched their face in confusion, bait taken.</p><p>“Then how’d you make that tweet?” She grinned, watching as their jaw worked. “You could’ve just asked, baby.”</p><p>Rio blew out a breath, leaning back. “Do you want to find a comment?”</p><p>“Sure.” Agatha got up, casually walking the short distance and sitting in Rio’s lap, scrolling through her options. There was a soft <i>”Uh,”</i> from the person she was now sitting on, Rio’s hands hovering around her but not actually resting. “Let's see…”</p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“I could’ve just <i>handed</i> my computer.”</p><p>“Nah,” She shifted, her skirt riding up ever so slightly, though the desk covered the camera from picking that up. Agatha wiggled her hips back but leaned her elbows forward on the desk, the soft sloping of her spine mimicking what she’d look like in the same position within another context. “This is much cozier.”</p><p>Their hands opted to grip the arm rests of the chair, knuckles white. “Okay.”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, momentarily looking back. She swiped her thumb over Rio’s bottom lip, catching some of her own residual lip oil. “You had something on your face.” She ignored the doe eyes they gave her, the huge pools of amber that made Agatha feel all warm inside, and read the damn screen. “No lube no protection all night all day from the kitchen floor to the toilet seat from the dining table to the bedroom from the bathroom sink to the shower from the front porch to the balcony vertically horizontally quadratic exponential logarithmic while I gasp for air scream-”</p><p>“Oh my god-”</p><p>“And see the light missionary cowgirl reverse cowgirl doggy backwards sideways upside down on the floor on the bed on the couch on a chair being carried against a wall outside in a train on a plane in a car on a motorcycle in the bed of a truck on a trampoline in a bounce house in the pool bent over in the basement against a window having the most toe curling back arching leg shaking pussy throbbing face clenching ear ringing mouth drooling ass clenching sheet gripping pulling mind blowing soul snatching overstimulating orgasm-”</p><p>“I get it!”</p><p>Agatha looked back again. “What’s wrong? Jealous?”</p><p>“No.” Rio pouted, hands suddenly on her thighs, which the camera wouldn’t be able to pick up. “I just don’t know if we can say some of the words and still be monetized.”</p><p>“Jealous.” She snorted, her breathing becoming weighted as Rio’s fingers toyed with the top hem of her thigh-high. “And terrible at hiding it.”</p><p>“That could’ve been about me, they never specified!”</p><p>“It better not be.” Agatha mean-mugged the camera, “I bite.”</p><p>Alice made them go for another thirty minutes before giving them a cue to close out the show, the producer looking beyond annoyed with the two of them.</p><p>“I’m going to slip my hand under your bra when I tell you this,” Agatha purred into the mic. “You’re all deranged in a way that is concerning to society, and that’s coming from <i>me</i>.”</p><p>Rio’s chin sat on her shoulder as they projected so the mic would catch their voice. “I agree, bra slipping excluded.”</p><p>“It’s certainly been…a show.” She closed the computer, waving to the camera. “I’m Agatha, under me is Rio, we’ll see you guys next time.”</p><p>Alice shot up, unamused. “Was the lap sitting necessary?"</p><p>“The show does better when the dykes assume I’m about to fuck their brains out!” Agatha defended, still not getting up. “You said so yourself!”</p><p>“I didn’t mind.” Rio added, hands not leaving her legs. “It’s warm.”</p><p>“It's seventy degrees in here.” Alice muttered, winding up cords. “I’ll edit it and hopefully it doesn’t look like a soft core porno.”</p><p>Agatha snickered out “Bet it’d be our top viewed show if it did.”</p><p>“Just don’t fuck on the desk.” Alice said, clicking off the camera, unplugging the HDMI, and grabbing her bag. “If this turns into a Fleetwood Mac situation…” She snatched her keys and computer, storming out the door. “I’m going to get a drink.”</p><p>“It’s the middle of the day.” Rio murmured.</p><p>“Almost 5PM,” Alice shouted, “Close enough!” letting the door close behind her.</p><p>“So,” Rio started, waiting for her to turn around. “Can I take you out? Dinner tonight?”</p><p>“Eager, are we?” Agatha quipped, finally rising to her feet.</p><p>“Very.” Rio said in earnest, gazing up at her. “I could pick you up at seven? Do you like sushi?”</p><p>Agatha grabbed her stuff, playing coy. “One kiss and you’re already whipped?”</p><p>“You hit on me within the first twenty minutes of us knowing each other…”</p><p>“Yeah, ‘cause you’re hot.” She scoffed, checking her phone. “I gotta go, Scratchy is gonna be pissed and I have about a thousand videos to record, edit, and post.”</p><p>Agatha started from the door, Rio following after and grabbing her wrist. “So, seven?”</p><p>Her eyes flickered from their hold up to their face, pursing her lips in faux annoyance. “Fine.”</p><p>Rio let go, nodding. “Cool.”</p><p>“Cool.” She echoed, opening the door.</p><p>“Wait, can I have your address?”</p><p>“I’ll text you it along with a nude.” She grumbled, savoring the sound of their breath hitching. Agatha gave a little wiggle of her fingers as a wave, laughing at Rio’s bright red face. “I’m fucking with you.”</p><p>“Yeah, no, I knew that.”</p><p>They most certainly did not.</p><p>After leaving the studio and texting Rio her address sans a nude photo, Agatha went home. She did all the regular bullshit that came with her line of work. Filmed, edited, posted, emailed whichever suit she needed to coordinate with that particular week. For all of the people she had to regularly communicate with, Agatha didn’t actually have all that many people in her life, nobody really. No steady partner, or friends, definitely no family. Everything confined to her phone, to an internet persona.</p><p>She had Scratchy in her lap as she doom scrolled, dissecting which trends were sure to pick up next and making a note to do them in the next forty-eight hours for maximum engagement. Her apartment was dim, and quiet, not a single soul around. Agatha got dressed for the date, a simple back dress and heels, feeding her son some spinach when someone pressed on the intercom. She buzzed them up, nervous despite seeing Rio for numerous hours a day, multiple times a week, for a month straight at this point.</p><p>What if they didn’t actually like her, but the person she was for the masses?</p><p>There was a knock on her door, Agatha undoing the chain and greeting Rio on the other side. They had on some trousers and a button up (that looked to have been ironed) underneath a vintage leather jacket. Rio extended their hand, palm bearing a single pink flower.</p><p>Rio smiled, offering the flower. “M’lady.”</p><p>She took it, a blush forming on her cheeks. “Dork.”</p><p>“You look…<i>amazing.</i>”</p><p>And though she could think of ten million ways to tease them for that, like <i>Just amazing? Not ethereal? Beautiful?</i>, she let it go and said “Thank you. You don’t look too bad yourself, hot stuff.”</p><p>“We’re not at work, you don’t have to call me that.” Rio dismissed, hands shoved in their jacket pockets.</p><p>She raised her brow. “And what if I just want to?”</p><p>“Oh, that’s…that’s good with me.”</p><p>She chuckled as she set the flower on the counter, grabbing her jacket and calling out into the apartment “Mister, I’m leaving! No drinking, no drugs, no hookers!” and locking the door.</p><p>Rio grabbed her hand, intertwining their fingers together quite fucking bashfully considering where their hand was earlier today. “There’s a place a few blocks away, if you’re cool walking.”</p><p>She peered down at her feet. “In these heels?”</p><p>“I’ll give you a piggyback ride if they end up hurting too much.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, lips curling upwards. “How chivalrous.”</p><p>“The heels do look hot, though.”</p><p>“Mmmh, play your cards right and I’ll keep them on later.”</p><p>“Later?”</p><p>“<i>Later.</i>”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha learned many things about Rio on their date; they were an only child, kind of a vet, had a cat named Victoria that was basically their child, and was <i>very</i> strong. Her arms were slung over their shoulders as they gave her a piggyback ride to the front steps of her building. Her heels were not meant for walking, they were meant for looking hot, and poor Rio had to find that out the hard way as they gently set her down on the bottom step. The three negronis she’d had with dinner had calmed her nerves, maybe Rio’s too, because they were just as tipsy. She giggled as her hands fisted in their jacket, tugging them close. “Do you wanna come up?”</p><p>It was more of a prompt than an actual question, because anyone who got that invite jumped at the chance. Agatha gave small pieces about herself; college, siblings, where she grew up–surface level bullshit. It was odd to be so comfortable with another person and actually know so little about them. She knew the smaller details of Rio–their favorite tea, their favorite snack (Hot Cheetos), and the tiny pout they wore when struggling to read something off a screen because they refused to wear their glasses. But the big stuff was still a mystery, and she begrudgingly found herself wanting to learn more.</p><p>Rio slowly removed Agatha’s hands, tucking their tongue against their cheek. “I want to, but usually I like to go on a few more dates first. Maybe even be official with the girl.”</p><p>She cocked her head in offense. “But…the heels…”</p><p>“It’s seriously nothing about you, I just like to get to know someone-”</p><p>“You had your hand up my skirt this afternoon.”</p><p>“Well, that wasn’t sex.” They awkwardly cleared their throat. “I’m on the ace spectrum. I like to have a connection with the person I’m having sex with, makes me feel more comfortable. I don’t talk about it a lot because people on the internet don’t really like the term ‘demisexual’ but…yeah.”</p><p>Her face scrunched subconsciously. “So, you don’t know me?”</p><p>“I know you.” They smiled all too tenderly. “I just don’t know you <i>well.</i>”</p><p>“Have my constant innuendos made you uncomfortable? Because you could’ve told me to stop and I seriously would have.”</p><p>“No no,” Rio chuckled, a light blush coating their cheeks. “I mean <i>yes</i>, but in a way I liked.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips, squinting her eyes. “You are a curious case.”</p><p>“I’ve gotten that before.” They leaned forward, kissing her cheek. “Goodnight, Agatha. I’ll see you Monday.”</p><p>She watched them turn to leave, calling after, “We can just make out, ya know!”</p><p>Rio quickly peeked over their shoulder, grinning. “Thanks for the date, let’s do it again! Soon!”</p><p>Agatha slumped as they got farther away. What the fuck, sex was her one tool and suddenly that was void here. Why would someone want to get to know anyone nowadays, everyone was a freak and nobody actually liked the person they’re screwing…</p><p>Huh, okay, maybe Rio had a point.</p><p>She stalked up to her apartment, kicking off those heinous heels and immediately going for Scratchy’s enclosure. Agatha scooped him up, giving him a few kisses and murmuring, “We got rejected, mister.”</p><p>Over the span of the next <i>two months,</i> she patiently waited. Date after date, day after day. She kept up the flirting on the pod, but found herself and Rio having deeper conversations off camera. Agatha learned <i>a lot</i> the night that Rio finally brought her back to their place. It was old and cozy with dark wood trim, filled to the fucking brim with plants. Apparently, Rio’s dream was to make enough one day that they could get a place with a proper balcony, not one of those shitty ones that were barely big enough for one person.</p><p>They donated a good chunk of the pod’s revenue to LGBTQ+ organizations, taking it out of their own pay in order to do so. Their favorite color was green (that wasn’t a surprise), they liked dry wine and hated scallops. Rio was allergic to parsley, which is a pain in the ass because a lot of restaurants put parsley in fucking everything. They had a good relationship with their parents–that one led to a very unpleasant conversation about Agatha’s own mother. She knew them, she knew them pretty fucking well.</p><p>Rio was absurdly kind for a New Yorker, although they were a transplant so it checked out. They did shit like swipe their own metro card when someone else was out of money, or help their elderly neighbor with her groceries, and pay their late fees for their library books. Yeah, they used the public library. They cooked, pretty damn well, too. They had a fascination with arachnids and would’ve had a pet tarantula if not for their cat. So, Agatha gave info back, definitely just to get laid and nothing more. It was definitely super normal to nurture a relationship for this long <i>just</i> for sex.</p><p>And if some nights she was content to fall asleep atop Rio during a movie, then it was just an anomaly. And yes, she might’ve told them about her silly dream of living in a cottage somewhere away from civilization, but it didn’t <i>mean</i> anything. Sure, they were coworkers who occasionally made out, even got to second base a few times, but it wasn’t like-</p><p>Fuck, they were in a real relationship, weren’t they?</p><p>God damn that sneaky fucking bastard.</p><p>Lured her in with the possibility of sex so she’d get attached.</p><p>Agatha peered down at the cat purring happily in her lap as she sat in Rio’s apartment in late July, the realization drenching her like ice water. Rio was cooking her dinner, the bottle of wine already opened and candles already lit at the microscopic dining table. Wow, that domesticity really snuck up on her. She gently set Victoria down, tiptoeing into the kitchenette. She watched as Rio plated the food, setting the dishes on the table and pulling out her chair for her.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I didn’t put cilantro in yours. I know you have the soap gene and-”</p><p>“What are we doing?!” Agatha snapped, not out of anger but out of frustration.</p><p>“Um, eating…?”</p><p>She scoffed, sitting down at the table. “No, I mean…what are <i>we</i> doing?”</p><p>Rio sat across from her, brows furrowed. “In what sense?”</p><p>Agatha leaned back, groaning, “What sense do you think?”</p><p>“Like, what are we?”</p><p>“Yes!” She hissed, slapping her hands down and making the silverware clatter. “We’ve known each other for almost six months, dating for two. We’re in some pseudo relationship but I don’t remember either one of us asking to make things official. For how hard you get over commitment, you’re really chill with casual dating.” Agatha let out a tired breath. “It’s not even about the sex anymore, I’m just so confused about what any of this is. I’m not your girlfriend, or even really your friend. We’re coworkers who flirt for views and then play <i>7 Minutes in Heaven</i> in private.” She then corrected herself. “I <i>like</i> what we do in private, but fuck, I don’t understand what mind game this is.”</p><p>Rio seemed strangely endeared, the corners of their lips quirking upwards. “There’s no game, I just like spending time with you. I was waiting for you to say something. Given how…<i>hesitant</i> you were to do anything real, I wanted to give you the space you needed.”</p><p>“I don’t want space, Rio,” Agatha whined. “I want to have sex, preferably with you.”</p><p>“Yeah, you’ve made that clear, baby.”</p><p>“Do you not?”</p><p>Rio tilted their head, leaning forward. “Agatha, I can promise you, I have thought about nothing else. It’s not that I don’t want to. I’ve had past experiences with people sticking around long enough for me to feel comfortable having sex, then they bolt after we’re done. And, for me, it’s hard to swallow–to know someone only stayed so that we’d fuck, and then just take off.”</p><p>Agatha relaxed in her seat, frowning while she quietly said, “I wouldn’t do that. I’d never do that.”</p><p>“I believe you,” they replied in earnest, reaching across the small distance and grabbing her hand with their own. “And if it eases your mind, I’ve considered you my girlfriend for the past month.”</p><p>“What the fuck, and you didn’t tell me?!”</p><p>“Didn’t want to spook you.”</p><p>“I’m not a horse!”</p><p>Rio chuckled as they grinned. “Of course not…you have a much better mane.”</p><p>Agatha raised her chin, pouting. “So I’m your girlfriend but you’re not mine? That hardly seems fair.”</p><p>“I can be,” Rio said softly. “If that’s what you want.”</p><p>“I don’t really <i>do</i> relationships, as a warning. I might suck at it.”</p><p>“You’ve been doing pretty well so far.”</p><p>She ignored that, because it gave her a fluttering feeling in her chest and she’d rather not acknowledge it. “Well, that’s ‘cause I’m exceptional.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened as they laughed, the low lighting of the candles projecting their silhouettes onto the wall. Even their fucking shadows looked mushy together, all intertwined ove the table. “I-” Rio’s phone lit up on the counter, buzzing erratically. “Shit, let me silence it.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand felt cold as Rio released it, but she picked up her fork anyway, studying her meal to distract from what just happened. How the hell did they always do that–make her feel all gooey inside. She wasn’t even upset about the lack of sex, she was too enthralled in the prospect of Rio wanting her around.</p><p>“Gimme a minute,” Rio chirped, picking up the call. “It’s Alice.” They swung around, facing away as they spoke. “Okay. No, it’s fine. Alice, I can work a damn camera. No, I won’t fuck up your audio settings. Dude, I had the pod long before I met you, I will survive.” A few seconds later they hung up, telling Alice, “Yeah, feel better.” They silenced their phone, throwing it back down onto the counter. “Alice is sick, can’t make it in tomorrow.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“It’ll be fine, I just gotta do the behind the scenes stuff too.”</p><p>“Mmmmh, so we’ll be all alone in the studio for the next episode?”</p><p>“Yeah…?”</p><p>“Baby, do you remember what Al planned for the next ep?”</p><p>They shrugged as they sat back down. “Yeah, we’re reading sapphic fiction.”</p><p>Agatha darkly chuckled. “Sweetheart, Alice didn’t say fiction. She said fanfiction. As in, random dykes on the internet writing us fucking.”</p><p>“I agreed to that?!”</p><p>She slowly nodded, cutting a piece of chicken on her plate and happily popping it into her mouth. “Gonna be a <i>fun</i> show.”</p><hr/><p>The next morning, Rio set up everything before Agatha arrived, inexplicably nervous. Listen, Rio had obviously had sex, even thought themself pretty fucking good at it too. But, airing out any sexual fantasy to nearly three hundred thousand people was slightly daunting. Especially since they hadn’t even had actual sex with Agatha, and not out of disinterest. They meant what they said last night–all of it. They’d been burned before and Agatha’s reluctant willingness was actually sweet. She didn’t pressure them once after their first date, and was a surprisingly great listener.</p><p>Rio wasn’t worried about Agatha crossing a line, but they were worried about the relentless teasing they’d endure. The studio door opened, their girlfriend waltzing in. <i>Holy fucking hell.</i> She wore a tiny purple tank top, lace embroidered on the hem. Her hair was in a lazy updo and the denim shorts she had on fucking <i>clung</i> to her thighs. There was a thin sheen of sweat coating her skin, the summer sun making her freckles stand out even more than they already did. Agatha dropped her bag, sprinting towards the AC unit, humming in relief. “Oh, thank god.”</p><p>They stood there, mouth agape and blinking dumbly. Sure, they’d felt each other up, had some pretty heavy make out sessions, but clothes had stayed on. All the skin looked so biteable, hell, Rio could lick the sweat off her. They cleared their throat, fixing their muscle tank even though it wasn’t in need of fixing. “Hot out there?”</p><p>“We’re all simply an iPad that a snot-nosed toddler devil is coughing all over,” she grumbled, lifting her tank slightly to get the airflow against her skin. Her stomach tensed against the chill, her abs jerking in response.</p><p>Rio gulped, steadying the camera and setting up the audio. “I got you a diet coke, it’s still cold.” They pointed to the desk where her favorite soda sat next to her mic.</p><p>Agatha smiled, crossing the studio and giving them a kiss. “Thanks, hon,” she whispered against their lips. “We ready to go?”</p><p>Rio nodded, following their girlfriend over to the desk and trying to catch their breath. Once they were both settled, they smiled at the camera in a warm greeting. “Hey ya’ll, welcome back to My-”</p><p>The hissing pressure of the coke can interrupted them, Agatha immediately chugging half the can and sighing in contentment. “And I’m-” she didn’t finish before belching out into the mic. Agatha snorted as Rio keeled over laughing, swiveling their chair so as not to make their listeners go deaf. “Please-” Agatha cackled, trying to speak through labored breaths. “Please excuse her.”</p><p>They swiped the tears in their eyes, attempting to get their giggles under control. “Wel-” Rio gasped. “Welcome back, guys!”</p><p>“You can’t give me diet coke and expect me not to chug it!”</p><p>“You didn’t have to down it like a toddler does with juice!”</p><p>She flipped her hair. “You obviously just don’t get it.”</p><p>“Yeah, thank god for that.” Rio looked into the camera. “As I was saying, we’re back with another show for you guys. By popular request, we will be reading the smut you guys put on the internet about us.” They then locked onto their girlfriend. “Agatha, have you ever read fanfic?”</p><p>“I have partaken, yes,” Agatha purred into the mic. “Although I’ve never read it about myself. I can’t wait to see if they’re accurate or not. What about you? Ever jorked it to some swanqueen porn?”</p><p>Rio raised a brow at that, because there could not be accuracy. They had toed the line between confirming and denying anything between them. Neither of them really wanted a public relationship, but dissuading the rumors could mean a drop in views. So, they kept it ambiguous. “I have read fanfic, but not for smut.”</p><p>“Liar,” Agatha snarked. “Porn is what fanfic is for.”</p><p>“I liked the sweet fluffy stories or canon divergence.” Rio opened their laptop screen recording to edit into the final cut so the viewers could also see. “Nobody look at my ao3 account, my bookmarks are private.”</p><p>“If you’re not reading porn, why are they private?”</p><p>“...Besides the point.”</p><p>“Ahhhh!” She pointed an accusatory finger. “You’ve totally masturbated to fanfic before!”</p><p>Rio bounced their knee anxiously. “What about you? You ever-”</p><p>“More times than I can count, pretty boy.” She leaned in, speaking dangerously low. “Unless my imagination can provide a better picture, or a more <i>enticing</i> partner…”</p><p>Rio’s tongue wetted their bottom lip, fidgeted with the scroll pad. “Right.”</p><p>“Anyway.” Agatha pulled out her own computer, after so many episodes it just made sense for her to have one. “Let’s see what depraved shit people put onto the internet as jacking material.”</p><p>They found the tag, a humble 88 fics, which seemed small but anything over double digits for real person fanfic seemed steep to Rio. “Shit.” They scrolled through the filters. “Like, 90% of the entire tag is mature or explicit.”</p><p>“They really clocked us, baby,” Agatha snickered. “Freaky internet lesbians cosplaying hypersexuality.” She glared at the camera. “My culture is not your costume-”</p><p>“Okay, let’s get into it!” Rio interjected, clicking the first fic on the front page. “This one is…” They curiously tilted their head. “Ummm.”</p><p>“Sound it out, darling. You can do it,” Agatha faux encouraged. “I believe in you.”</p><p>Rio rolled their eyes, calmly reciting the summary. “When Agatha gets a private message from someone in a Dungeons and Dragons server claiming to be a lesbian, she plays into the game, stringing along what she assumes to be some awkward incel and getting them way too seriously into the Discord daddy/kitten dynamic.Agatha is very, very incorrect about who is on the other end of her screen. The problem she inevitably faces is how deep the teeth marks are going to be when this bites her in the ass. Or, yes, the agathario discord kitten au.”</p><p>“Fuck yes,” she exclaimed. “My life’s dream to fuck with you will be achieved through making you read about me calling you <i>daddy.</i>”</p><p>That word made Rio flush, but more importantly– “What?”</p><p>“Daddy kink is tagged, handsome.”</p><p>No way in hell were they going to survive this. Their mouth opened but no sound came out, so Agatha being Agatha simply skipped to the smut and began reading.</p><p>“I think we’re having phone sex here.” She confidently cleared her throat, putting on a fake sexy voice to read the except. <i>“"Yeah?” Agatha can hear the smirk in her own voice. “What’re you thinking about?”</i></p><p><i>Rio’s voice is still gruff. “You still in that baby tee and panties?”</i></p><p><i>Agatha nods before realizing Rio can’t see her. “Mhmm.”</i></p><p><i>“Keep them on,” Rio orders. “Turn the vibrator on and rub it on yourself through your underwear.”<br/>
</i></p><p><i>When Agatha had brought up the idea of a voice call, she hadn’t expected to be the one taking orders, but the idea of dragging along the foreplay to finish off with a nice orgasm or two certainly doesn’t have her complaining. “Of course, daddy.”</i></p><p><i>Her tone is laced with a good amount of teasing, but it has Rio sputtering out a choked breath, anyway. Agatha clicks on the second lowest setting on her vibrator and presses the thick tip to her covered mons, just above her clit, and she hums contentedly. She lets out a theatrical sigh, wanting to make sure Rio can hear it on the other end.<br/>
</i></p><p><i>“This feels nice. Wanna know what color underwear I’m wearing?”<br/>
</i></p><p><i>“Yes.” Rio sounds greedy.”</i> Agatha smirked as her eyes flicked up to Rio. “You wanna know what color underwear I’m wearing today?”</p><p><i>Yes, real life Rio greedily thought.</i></p><p>“Moving on,” Rio squeaked, squeezing their thighs together as they went back to the homepage.</p><p>“I wanna do this one!” Agatha proclaimed, airdropping the link so Rio could pull it up as well. “But you gotta read it.”</p><p>“Agatha…what the fuck?” They asked, skimming the summary of the fic. “A vampire au?”</p><p>“Don’t sell it short; a vampire au where I’m a succubus.” She bears her teeth like it's supposed to be a smile. “God, do I love horny little perverts.”</p><p>Rio can do this, they can, so they skipped to the portion Agatha had highlighted and prayed to a god they didn’t believe in. “<i>“You feel so good inside, baby,” Rio groans. “Can I bite you again? I want to feel how tightly you’ll squeeze my fingers—”</i></p><p><i>“Yes, yes, bite me,” Agatha babbles.<br/>
</i></p><p><i>Rio wastes no time in biting Agatha above her breast. Agatha lets out a shocked, choking scream at the sensation. Rio is drinking from her, right over her heart. If she thought being bitten on the thigh was pleasurable, it’s nothing compared to Rio’s fangs sinking in just above her heart.<br/>
She comes almost as soon as Rio’s fangs sink into her skin, tightening around Rio’s fingers like a vice, squirting out her orgasm wetly. Agatha can feel Rio moan around her skin as she continues to drink and as Agatha continues to take what she wants from Rio with her fingers until she comes again.</i>” Rio clamped down on the nail of their thumb, mumbling “‘S good.”</p><p>“You didn’t even get to the somnophilia part,” Agatha whined. “Don’t kink shame the gentle authors.”</p><p>“I'm not–!” Rio deeply inhaled a breath to calm down. “I’m not kink shaming, thank you to this author.”</p><p>And if Rio really studied Agatha, they could see the blush coating her chest. The freckles now drenched in crimson, her nipple peaking out through her top since she never wore a fucking bra. Maybe this was affecting her as much as it was them. “Why does everyone write you as the top?”</p><p>Rio smirked, playing it cool. “Clearly I give off a certain vibe.”</p><p>“As if you could make me squirt like that-”</p><p>“Wanna bet?” They find themself countering with, which surprised even them.</p><p>Agatha blinked a couple of times, husking, “I don’t think there’s a way I could possibly lose that wager.”</p><p>“How about one where I fuck you on the beach?” Rio pulls up another, gaining some confidence at Agatha’s own stuttering. “It’s a White Lotus au.”</p><p>“That show is in desperate need of actual lesbian activity.”</p><p>“Do you wanna take this one, mi amor?”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her gaze, clenching her teeth, most likely at the pet name. “Fine, apparently you have a strap on already and we’re in a…cabana,” Agatha explained, her voice slightly hoarse. “<i>"Tell me how."<br/>
</i></p><p><i>Agatha’s skin prickled.<br/>
</i></p><p><i>"Don’t stop. Just… fuck me until I tap out, baby."<br/>
</i></p><p><i>Rio kissed the back of her neck, nodding. “Fuck, you’re perfect.”<br/>
</i></p><p><i>There was a pause. Agatha’s ears pricked-up at the sound of spit, a staggered grunt torn from her throat at the glide of fingers between her thighs again, and then her eyes literally rolled back as she felt the cool silicone pressed blunt against her.<br/>
</i></p><p><i>"You ready?" Rio murmured.<br/>
</i></p><p><i>Agatha didn’t answer with words. She pushed back against it, grinding her hips invitingly.<br/>
</i></p><p><i>That was enough.<br/>
</i></p><p><i>Rio grunted softly and slipped their cock inside. The fullness already had Agatha’s face buried into the crook of her elbow, in an attempt to muffle the involuntary noises threatening to spill out of her mouth.<br/>
</i></p><p><i>"You look so damn sexy for me." Rio whispered. 

</i></p><p><i>"Taking me so fucking deep. You know that?"<br/>
</i></p><p><i>"Mm– shut up, harder." Agatha bit out, but the tremble in her voice betrayed her.</i>” She rubbed her temples, taking a beat before saying, “We should’ve partnered with a sex toy company for this one. A free vibrator would do <i>wonders</i> for me right now.”</p><p>Normally, Rio would scold her for that, but right now? “Yeah,” they breathlessly agreed, too caught up in the mental image the work had just conjured.</p><p>“Maybe one more and then we call it?”</p><p>“Yup!” She rapidly nodded, crossing her legs in a way that was not for comfort.</p><p>“Oh cool, I’m transmasc in this one.” Rio clicked on the link, not even checking the tags past that one.</p><p>“Oh my god,” Agatha whispered to herself, sounding almost pained. “That’s so fucking hot.”</p><p>“Mh?” Rio peered over the screen.</p><p>“Nothing,” she barked, waving her hand dismissively. “Read.”</p><p>“Okay so you’re trying to give me my T-shot, and apparently my reward is…” Oh, they had shot themself in the foot here. How the fuck was this their day job? Their voice was thin as they read, way too thin. “<i>“Once they’re finished, they glance down at Agatha with dazed eyes, blinking at her. It’s difficult for Agatha to smirk with her partner’s dick in her mouth, but she must somehow manage it, because Rio gulps anxiously. Agatha begins to apply gentle suction, lashing her tongue over her lover’s cock and drinking it the sweet nectar of arousal that Rio leaks into her mouth.</i></p><p><i>It takes an embarrassingly short amount of time for Rio to come. Agatha opens her mouth wider to take not just their dick inside, but their cunt as well, the tip of her tongue swiping through their folds. Rio’s free hand, the one not holding the needle, grasps Agatha’s hair, clumsily gathering it into a ponytail and holding it back for her, while also guiding her movements. </i>” They took a beat before continuing, the power of suggestion was a very powerful thing. Their own clit had too much fucking blood flowing to it and Agatha breathing was too damn heavy.</p><p>Their gaze lifted to hers, and her face was so <i>slack</i>, her eyes kind of glassy. Agatha was sucking on her lower lip, her hand basically strangling the side of the desk. The air was thick, it was weighted as they just stared at one another. When Alice told them not fuck on the desk, Rio laughed it off. But now, now Rio very much wanted to fuck Agatha on this desk.<br/>
</p><p>“Keep going,” Agatha instructed, her chest rising and falling rapidly.<br/>
</p><p>“Ya know what?” Rio snapped their laptop shut, launching across the desk. “Fuck this.”</p><p>“Oh, thank fucking god.” She shot up too, meeting them in the middle.</p><p>They groped her waist, harshly yanking her body flush with theirs and clashing their lips against hers. It was by far the messiest kiss they’d ever exchanged, but Rio wanted to eat her whole. Rio tongue licked into her mouth as they spun her around, backing her up until her ass hit the lip of the desk. They were too pent up to think about the actual ramifications of hoisting their girlfriend up and spreading her legs against the flat surface of the table. They were too busy to remember that the audio and visuals were still rolling, too focused on fucking this woman to near unconsiousness to think about their job.</p><p>They blindly swiped behind Agatha, flinging a few papers and half a can of diet coke to the floor. Rio pushed her flat on her back as they climbed on top of her, mouthing along her neck and biting at her hammering pulse. Agatha’s hands burrowed in their hair as she arched against them, her legs hiking up so the heels of her shoes would rest on the edge. They quickly shoved her tank top upwards to bunch around her collarbones, moaning at just the sight of her tits. “You might be the hottest woman alive.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond with words, opting to just shove Rio’s head down to her chest. Taking the hint, they dragged their mouth across her chest, licking the salt along the valley of her breasts before wrapping their lips around her nipple, using their hand to stimulate the other. “Baby,” Agatha whimpered, causing Rio to lightly bite down on the hardened nub. “Fuck.”</p><p>Ideally, their first time with Agatha would’ve been in a bed. Rio always imagined it as a slow exploration of one another, rather than a quick, feral fuck at their place of work. But, as they unzipped their girlfriend’s shorts and shoved their fingers past the band of her underwear (they were red, for the record), Rio didn’t find the urge to complain. Because Agatha was under them, sweaty and flushed, and so fucking beautiful as those twin pools of blue got all hazy with lust. No, Rio couldn’t actually think at all past wanting to simultaneously please <i>and</i> humble this woman.</p><p>Their fingertips grazed thick untrimmed curls, already soaked with arousal. They huffed a chuckle, placing one hand on the desk for support. “The thought of blowing me do this to you?”</p><p>“Shut the fuck up,” she groaned, grabbing their wrist and trying to shove it deeper. “Like you’re not drenched.”</p><p>“Oh sweetheart, I’ve been turned on since you walked in here in these slutty little shorts.” Rio gathered the copious amounts of slick around their fingers, easily sinking two in and greedily drinking down the moan Agatha made in response by kissing her. Fuck, she always tasted delicious, but the diet coke was a delightful added layer. “You feel so fucking good, quierida. So fucking tight for me.”</p><p>“‘Cause I haven’t been getting fucked,” Agatha spat, whining out when Rio’s fingers curled.”It’s a god damn crime.”</p><p>“You’re so right, baby.” Rio rasped in between thrusts. “You’re so fucking good, should’ve done this sooner.” Honestly, now that they had reached this point as a couple, Rio feared that they’d want to spend the rest of their days inside of her. They ducked their head down, biting along the soft skin of Agatha’s throat. The compulsion to mark and possess her was all-consuming.</p><p>A high-pitched squeal tore from Agatha’s throat, the mix of pleasure and pain causing her to tense, her walls clamping down around Rio. “Harder, baby.”</p><p>And Rio could take direction well, shifting slightly to pump along with their hips to give each return more power. Their girlfriend screamed, the veins on her neck popping out as she threw her head back. Rio took the opportunity to skate their tongue against that jawline that had been the source of multiple daydreams–actually probably the source of several daydreams for thousands of lesbians. Damn, Rio had really won at life. “You’re so beautiful like this, all whiny around my fingers. You’re swallowing me, I can feel it.”</p><p>Agatha’s cunt fluttered as her thighs shook, ragged breaths following. “Rio- Ri- Oh, god-”</p><p>“You already close?” Rio emphasized the question by flexing their thumb, pressing it against her clit and rubbing tight circles. “Seems like I’m about to win that bet.”</p><p>Agatha reached up, her fingers coiling around their throat and squeezing. “Don’t tease.” She pressed on either side of their neck until their breath hitched. Her eyes rolled back as her jaw slackened. “Faster, faster!”</p><p>Rio happily obliged, their strokes became short but deep, making sure to hit her g-spot each time. “Let go for me, Agatha. Let me see you come around my fingers.”</p><p>Her hand went limp, falling to the desk while her other pulled their hair at the root. A need chant of, “Yes, yes, yes, y- <i>fuck, fuck, fuck,</i>” filled the room, her body snapping like a worn out rubber band as she came. And though it was normally rude, Rio didn’t give her a minute to relax before they fell to their knees. Rio ripped off her shorts and underwear in one fluid motion, not caring as the fabrics bunched around her ankles. They grabbed her thighs, pulling her towards the edge and stuffing their face against her pussy before she had a moment to sit up.</p><p>If Rio thought Agatha tasted good before, this was fucking <i>heaven</i>. Rio’s jaw unhinged as their tongue darted out, nuzzling her bush with their nose. Their girlfriends thighs snapped shut reflexively, squishing their face and possibly suffocating them–not that they’d complain, though. It didn’t deter them, not as they dug their thumbs into her hips and devoured whatever they could get.</p><p>“Oh, good boy,” Agatha moaned in ecstasy, sitting up halfway and holding the back of their head. Her hips jerked forward as Rio sucked her clit, gently scraping their teeth against the bundle of nerves and alternating flicking it with their tongue. “Touch yourself, handsome. I wanna see what I do to you.”</p><p>Only then were they aware of the <i>ache</i> between their own legs, pathetically bleating against Agatha’s cunt as they shoved a hand into their jorts. The waistband of their boxers were already on display, so their girlfriend had a perfect view as their knuckles disappeared, only stopping once they brought two digits to their own clit. Agatha bucked to meet their mouth, smirking through tiny sounds at the back of her throat.</p><p>“Feel good, hon?” Agatha simpered, raking her nails over their scalp. Their eyes closed instinctively, keeping their mouth moving in tandem with their hand. “Aww, poor baby, too pussy drunk to answer.”</p><p>Rio whined, their eyes opening slightly to look upwards. Agatha’s updo was half undone, her tits softly bouncing as she ground against their face. She looked like a fucking goddess and they were already close just from fingering her. So when she peered down with some moral sense of superiority, it threw them off the edge. Rio came with a muffled cry between Agatha’s thighs, trying their hardest not to let it interrupt the rhythm. Their girlfriend wailed out a few seconds later, using the grip in their hair to pull them to their feet.</p><p>She kissed them, messily and sloppily, savoring her taste on their lips. Agatha snatched their wrist, breaking the kiss to take the fingers they had just used on themself into her mouth. A moan rang out, but Rio couldn’t be sure if that was from them or her. Her tongue weaved between their digits, taking them as deep as possible, and okay, sure, maybe they pushed a little. When a choked-off gargle echoed from her and etched itself into Rio’s brain, they finally pulled their hand back.</p><p>“We need to go,” Rio ordered, tugging her underwear and shorts up. “Now.”</p><p>“What?” Agatha’s eyes crinkled, her face falling. “Wait, did you not want to-”</p><p>They yanked her top down, harshly cupping her chin as they said, “I need to take you back to my place so I can see how pretty you are crying around my cock.”</p><p>Agatha sighed in relief for the second time that day, nodding as she buttoned her pants. “Yeah, um-”</p><p>Good enough, Rio wrapped their arms around her waist, literally tossing her over their shoulder. “Great.”</p><p>“Rio!” She gasped as they carried her out of the studio as quickly as humanly possible. “I can walk!”</p><p>“This way is faster, trust me.”</p><hr/><p>Alice hadn’t heard from Rio in 24 hours, but once the mind fog of her flu cleared up, she made the effort to go into the studio herself. Upon entering, her eyes bugged at the dried soda splattered on the side wall and floors. There were papers strewn about, and most notably– everything left on. She shuffled towards the camera, which had died, groaning, “Dumbass.”</p><p>Once she was able to transfer the episode to her laptop, Alice perched at the producer desk with her headphones, snacking on some pretzels as the raw footage played. God, they’re both so fucking stupid. If Alice could see them squirming in their seats after a couple of fics, the audience would too, and they’d eat that shit up.</p><p>Alice popped another pretzel into her mouth at minute forty-two, choking on the salt as Rio fucking threw Agatha onto the table, and well–<i>“The thought of blowing me do this to you?”</i> She hacked up pretzel as she slammed her laptop closed, keeling over and flailing for her phone.</p><p>The line trilled three times before Rio finally answered, their voice completely raw. “Hello?”</p><p>“Who is it?” Agatha’s own voice carried, groggy and strained.</p><p>“Alice,” Rio said, farther away from the receiver. “What-”</p><p>Alice cut them off, screaming at the top of her lungs, “What was my <i>ONE</i> rule?!”</p>
