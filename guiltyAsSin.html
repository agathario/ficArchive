<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Rio Vidal didn’t grow up in politics. She grew up in a two-bedroom apartment where the AC only worked when it felt like it, where her dad cursed at soccer games in Spanish and her mom argued about local policies over a plate of arroz con pollo.</p><p>She was supposed to be just another girl from a working-class neighborhood, someone who knew exactly which gas stations sold the best taquitos and how to stretch a paycheck until the next one rolled in. She was supposed to be normal. Get a degree, get a job, maybe get a dog. </p><p>Then her mom ran for president, and actually won. </p><p>One minute, Rio was a girl who could disappear into a crowd, and the next, her face was on every news channel. People suddenly had opinions about her: what she wore, how she talked, whether she was too loud, too Latina, too privileged, or somehow all three at once. Even some rando on the internet once called her “America’s most expensive diversity hire,” which was hilarious considering she isn’t even on payroll.</p><p>Overnight, she went from being a nobody to America’s First Daughter.</p><p>Now, instead of worrying about finals, she had to worry about the State of the Union. Instead of ordering a cheeseburger in peace, she had to deal with a Secret Service agent assessing the structural integrity of a Shake Shack. </p><p>People always ask her, “Don’t you hate it? Living under a microscope? Losing your privacy?”</p><p>Sure, it was weird. Having her entire existence scrutinized, waking up to think pieces on whether her outfit was too rebellious or too uninspired.<em> Pick a struggle, America </em>. But she wasn’t some tragic princess locked in a tower, dramatically sighing into the night.</p><p>At first, people did assume she hated it. They expected her to be miserable, trapped in a world of press conferences, formal dinners, and cameras catching her worst angles. And sure, she misses being able to go to the grocery store without a security detail or eat fries without it turning into a headline. But here’s the thing:</p><p>Rio <em> likes </em>being the president’s daughter.</p><p>Her mom was the last person anyone expected to come from a place like Delaware and end up as the first female president of the United States. The first to carry Latina roots in the White House. The first person who understood what it was like to grow up with nothing and still believe you could change the world.</p><p>Rio knows what it means for little girls to see someone with her skin, her last name, her attitude standing in spaces that used to be impenetrable. She knows what it means for kids in struggling neighborhoods to hear her mom’s story and realize, for the first time, that power isn’t just for the rich and pre-approved. That power can look like <em> them </em>.</p><p>If being America’s First Daughter means pushing the door open wider for the next generation, then she’d gladly trade in her normal life. Because normal was never the goal. History is what she’s after.</p><p>Speaking of history, here she is, currently cruising through the streets of London in a bulletproof limousine, en route to Buckingham Palace for the first time. Crowds line the streets, waving tiny American and British flags, treating her like she’s an actual celebrity.</p><p>Which, technically, she is. At least, that’s what the woman on BBC News had just declared as her face flashed across the limo’s built-in TV screen.</p><p>
  <em> “The highly anticipated royal wedding of Prince Edward and his childhood sweetheart, Lady Eleanor Ashford, is set to welcome a distinguished gathering of global figures. Among the notable attendees is Rio Vidal, daughter of U.S. President Isabel Vidal, who has arrived in London for the prestigious event. Widely regarded as a modern symbol of representation, the young American is famously admired for her intelligence and candor, though not without criticism, as some argue…”  </em>
</p><p>Rio reaches forward and hits the mute button. “I still don’t get why I have to go alone,” she mutters, adjusting her dress. “Why couldn’t Mom send an actual diplomat?”</p><p>“Because you’re America’s First Daughter, and this is the perfect opportunity to reinforce your international presence,” Alice says, sounding like she’s reciting a press release. As Rio’s Secret Service agent, longtime friend, and unofficial media liaison, it’s literally her job to say things like that. “Also, the British press is obsessed with you, and the White House wants to maintain good relations with the Crown.”</p><p>Rio snorts. “Obsessed with me? Please.”</p><p>Alice gives her a look, “I have a folder full of news articles to back that up.”</p><p>Okay, sure. Maybe the British tabloids have taken a weird interest in Rio ever since her mom won the election. Maybe there’ve been multiple articles about her “fresh take on American diplomacy,” which is just a fancy way of saying she tweets whatever’s on her mind.</p><p>
  <span>And maybe, just maybe, there’s been some speculation about whether or not she and Prince Edward have secretly dated after a single, completely platonic handshake at a UN event a year ago. But that’s not her fault. She would never be interested in the prince, or any man, for that matter. No one knows that, though. Not even her family. Just Alice.</span>
</p><p>“Can you believe they’re spending £65,000 on a cake? Just the cake. That’s, like, insane,” Rio mutters, flipping through a magazine on the royal wedding preparations. The headline blares: <b> <em>A Slice of Royal Excess: The £65,000 Cake Stirring Up More Than Just Frosting.</em> </b></p><p>She rolls her eyes. “For that price, they could’ve actually solved some real problems, like feeding people who can’t even afford a slice of cake.”</p><p>And before their conversation in the limo can go any further, the news screen inside the car flashes footage of the royal family, smiling and waving from the palace balcony.</p><p>
  <em> “...as the world eagerly anticipates the grand wedding of Prince Edward, excitement is also building over the appearance of his younger sister, Princess Agatha Harkness,” the reporter announces in that overly polished news anchor voice. “The so-called ‘spare to the throne’ has long been a favorite of both the media and the public, both for her impeccable style, effortless charm and the occasional…shall we say, spirited behavior.” </em>
</p><p>Next to Prince Edward’s painfully perfect smile, Princess Agatha has a completely different energy. She isn’t beaming for the cameras like her brother, she's just smirking. As if she knows exactly how ridiculous the whole thing is and is thoroughly enjoying it.</p><p>If Rio didn’t already hate her, she would roll her eyes at how effortlessly cool she looks. But she does already hate her.</p><p>Somehow, despite growing up on opposite sides of the Atlantic, Rio and Agatha end up as constant targets of comparison. The media just loves them. Ever since Rio’s mother took office, tabloids have latched onto the idea that she and the princess are some kind of cosmic twins: two women thrust into power they never asked for, both young faces who either have people swooning or wishing they'd disappear into a tower somewhere. They both steal headlines, steal hearts, and, occasionally, steal the spotlight from their more responsible family members.</p><p>But, for the record, Rio does not appreciate being compared to a woman who has probably never had to budget for gas money in her life.</p><p>“So,” Alice says, glancing at the screen, “you do know that, by the end of the night, there will be at least three headlines about the two of you in the same room, right?”</p><p>“You know what?” Rio says, waving a hand dismissively. “I’ve got a better idea. What if we skip Buckingham and just hit some tourist spots instead? That’d be way more fun.”</p><p>Alice gives her a pointed look. “For once, as your friend, can you just be honest? What’s your deal with the princess? Why do you have so much beef with her?”</p><p>“Please, I don’t have beef,” Rio scoffs. “She’s just a human ice sculpture. I don’t like snobs.” She watches as the news cuts to an old clip of Agatha effortlessly shutting down a reporter with a cutting remark. “She’s too smug, too entitled, and way too out of touch. With all the rumors about her, she somehow never faces real consequences, never gets into actual trouble.”</p><p>Alice smirks. “Well, she is royalty, so technically, she <em> is </em> entitled. And you do realize people say the exact same thing about you, right?”</p><p>Rio shoots her a look. “I’m totally not a snob. I am also not entitled,” she says, feigning outrage. She then sets the magazine down when she realizes she’s been staring at Agatha’s picture at a polo game longer than necessary. “And I’m not a princess.” </p><p>“No, but you are the closest thing America’s got.”</p><p>The car pulls through the grand gates of Buckingham Palace, security teams swarming as the motorcade slows. Outside, cameras fire off relentlessly, but the excitement doubles the second Rio finally steps out. Because, apparently, nothing gets the press going like an American causing a scene on British soil.</p><p>Alice adjusts the earpiece in her ear and scans the crowd. “Try to be nice,” she murmurs, standing just close enough to be heard over the distant chatter of arriving guests.</p><p>“I am nice,” Rio mutters, flashing a diplomatic smile at the cameras.</p><p>But Alice gives her a dry look. “You once told a senator to ‘grow a spine’ on national television.”</p><p>“It was because he was being spineless,” Rio says, smoothing down the front of her gown.</p><p>“If anything goes wrong, Lilia’s going to have my head, and I’ll be blaming you for it.”  </p><p>“Relax, Gulliver. I promise, I’ll be on my best behavior,” Rio quips.</p><p>Rio stands in line, surrounded by the kind of people who own yachts, and probably separate vacation homes just for those yachts. To her left, a European diplomat is rambling about trade agreements. To her right, some billionaire’s wife clutches a designer bag that probably costs more than a college education. The room smells like expensive perfume and champagne, and somewhere in the distance, a string quartet plays the kind of music that makes Rio deeply aware of how many forks are going to be at the dinner table.</p><p>Up ahead, the grand ballroom shimmers with centuries of wealth and perfectly polished tradition. It’s definitely a sight, but all Rio can think about is having to shake hands with a royal family she has very strong opinions about.</p><p>Alice, standing just behind her, nudges her side lightly. </p><p>“If you roll your eyes one more time, they’re going to fall out of your head.” </p><p>“Ow,” Rio says, pretending to wince. “And you say that like it’s a bad thing.”</p><p>Then the murmurs start, and there’s a sudden shift in attention –</p><p>– which means the royal family has finally entered the room. </p><p>Up ahead, the royal family walks in their perfect little formation, well, most of them. Queen Evanora is nowhere to be seen, which isn’t exactly shocking. The world knows she’s not exactly the social type, and after her husband’s death two years ago, her public appearances have become even rarer. She attended the ceremony at the church earlier, but if Rio had to guess, the Queen is already tucked away in her chambers, avoiding the rest of the spectacle.</p><p>Rio has only met the Queen once, and that’s more than enough. She has the kind of icy stare that feels sharp enough to cut glass, and Rio has no interest in locking eyes with her again. Guess that’s where Agatha gets it from. Being cold must run in the family.</p><p>In the Queen’s absence, Prince Edward leads the royals in greeting guests, the perfect picture of a polished heir in his red ceremonial military uniform. Beside him, his new bride, Lady Eleanor, radiates the effortless glow that comes with marrying into an absurd amount of wealth.</p><p>And then there’s her. Princess Agatha Harkness, wearing an elegant purple dress that looks like satin, probably designer, definitely ridiculously expensive. Her brown locks are styled so perfectly that not a single strand is out of place. Rio has to admit Agatha carries herself with the kind of grace that only the obscenely privileged can pull off.  </p><p>Alice, who never misses anything, leans in slightly again.</p><p>“Please don’t punch the princess.”</p><p>“Why would you even think that?” Rio scoffs. “I would never.”</p><p>But Alice raises a skeptical brow.</p><p>“Not in public, anyway.”</p><p>The line begins to move. One by one, guests step forward, offering polite greetings while the royals nod and smile in that detached but gracious way. Rio watches as a glamorous European countess curtsies flawlessly before the Prince, while a middle-aged tech billionaire attempts a bow so stiff it looks like he might snap in half. And then it’s her turn.</p><p>Rio extends her hand and smiles her most harmless American guest smile.</p><p>“Your Highness.”</p><p>“Miss Vidal,” Prince Edward greets with a polite nod. “A pleasure seeing you again.”</p><p>“It’s nice to see you too. Congratulations on your wedding. Everything’s <em> absolutely </em> top-notch,” Rio says, dripping with sarcasm. Alice clears her throat, but the prince doesn’t catch it.</p><p>But before he could comprehend, if he even would, Lady Eleanor steps forward, offering a smile that’s almost too warm. “Your mother speaks very highly of you.”</p><p>Rio smiles back. “She definitely exaggerates. I’m mostly just here for the food.”</p><p>To her surprise, the newlyweds actually laugh – a genuine, real laugh. Which, as far as Rio is concerned, is a social victory. <em> Take that, diplomatic training. </em></p><p>
  <span>Then finally, Rio turns to Agatha. Their eyes meet, and Rio feels a jolt in her chest, something like annoyance, maybe a little adrenaline. It’s been over two years since they last had any real exchange, and even then, calling it a conversation would be a stretch. Up close, Agatha’s face still has that infuriatingly flawless, almost otherworldly quality, like it’s been sculpted from marble. Rio kind of wants to smash that marble.</span>
</p><p>And at that moment, she has two obvious options. One: be the bigger person, shake the hand, and get it over with. Two: set Buckingham Palace on fire with the sheer force of her pettiness, and watch it all burn down in glorious drama.</p><p>Unfortunately, diplomacy frowns upon arson.</p><p>So, left with no other choice, Rio extends her hand. “Princess, how’s royal life treating you?”</p><p>Agatha barely spares it a glance. Instead, she gives a small, practiced bow and walks right past her like Rio’s nothing more than an overly chatty butler. <em> Wow. What a bitch.   </em></p><p>“Tell me you saw that.” Rio turns to Alice, who looks dangerously close to laughing. Rio groans, already counting down the minutes until she can get herself a drink. Damn it. She definitely should have picked option two.</p><p>The banquet is exactly what Rio expected: extravagant, over-the-top, and packed with people who probably have no idea how much a gallon of milk costs. Gold-rimmed plates and crystal glasses are everywhere, along with chandeliers so massive they could pay off student loans with a single drop. Above them, the ceiling is covered in some dramatic painting of a grand historic battle, reminding everyone that yes, the British monarchy has been here for centuries and is very proud of it.</p><p>Rio, on the other hand, is here for one reason and one reason only. Alcohol.  </p><p>Alice has been shadowing her all evening, playing the part of the responsible babysitter who makes sure Rio doesn’t say or do anything that would turn into an international incident. But the moment her agent gets pulled aside to check in with the security detail, Rio makes a break for it.</p><p>Straight to the open bar.</p><p>She grabs a glass of champagne, pauses, then decides one isn’t going to cut it and takes another. If she’s going to endure an entire reception surrounded by people who consider deer stalking and pheasant shooting a personality trait, she’s going to need reinforcements.</p><p>She wanders through the crowd, dodging small talk, sipping her drink, and admiring the level of delusion and audacity it takes to throw a party this expensive while half the country, and the rest of the world, can barely afford groceries.</p><p>And that’s when she sees Agatha yet again, standing near the massive, seven-tiered wedding cake that’s so insanely decorated with sugar flowers, it looks like something that belongs in the Louvre rather than on a plate.</p><p>Rio flags down a waiter once more, deciding that the rest of the reception will be dedicated to getting gloriously, methodically drunk. She’s never told anyone, and never will, but the first time she saw Agatha was when she was thirteen. It’s a memory that only resurfaces when she’s had a little too much to drink. </p><p>Her obsession with magazines started in her teens. In the middle of each issue, there were always these little posters you could tear out and stick up in your room. And if you were careful enough, you could get them all out without ruining the whole page.</p><p>One poster, right in the middle, always caught her eye. It showed a girl with thick brown hair, striking blue eyes, and a smile that would have melted ice. She was horseback riding, with the reins loosely in her hands, looking so free and so confident. Like she wasn’t posing for a picture at all. On the bottom corner, in swirly pink and purple letters: <b>Princess Agatha.</b></p><p>As her mom’s political career took off, Rio started to realize more and more that the world was going to know who she was too, whether she liked it or not. And sometimes, when the pressure of it all felt a little too much, she’d think back to that picture of young Agatha. The way she seemed so confident and at ease in the spotlight, like she could do anything. Rio would try to imagine herself like that, holding onto that kind of confidence, even though she wasn’t sure if it could be faked.</p><p>
  <span>Then came the first time she met Agatha. Just over two years ago. Rio couldn’t shake the memory of Agatha’s first words to her. The young girl in the picture, so effortlessly confident and carefree, was a complete illusion. The real Agatha. The Agatha she met in person was beautiful, yes, but she was also cold and distant, like she was made of ice. It was clear the princess didn’t care about anyone around her. </span>
</p><p>It felt like a punch to the gut. Rio had spent so much time wanting to be like her. But now? Now Rio couldn’t even fathom why she’d ever thought that. </p><p>Agatha stands there, watching her brother and new sister-in-law twirl around the ballroom floor with the others, all the while surrounded by a sea of guests. She looks obviously half-interested, like she has somewhere far more important to be than stuck with these people. Rio can’t resist calling her bluff. <em> Such a fake idgafer, </em> she thinks with a roll of her eyes.</p><p>With a wry smile, Rio threaded her way through the crowd, casually snagging yet another glass of wine from a passing tray and knocking back half of it in one go. </p><p>“I couldn’t help but notice,” Rio begins with a half-smirk, “you’ve only had one glass of champagne all night. That’s a bit too restrained for a royal, don’t you think?”</p><p>“Miss Vidal,” Agatha drawls, “Enjoying the fine British hospitality, I see.”</p><p>Rio takes a deliberate sip of her champagne, letting the bubbles settle before meeting Agatha’s eyes. “Immensely,” she says, smiling. “Shouldn’t you be doing the same? It’s your brother’s wedding, after all. Not enjoying it would be a waste of all the money poured into this grandeur.”</p><p>Agatha smiles back, the kind of smile that could belong on the front of a royal crest. “You're right, but I'm quite content with my own company,” she replies.</p><p>The worst part is, Rio knows Agatha can’t stand her either. They’re like natural rivals, but Agatha refuses to just admit it. Though Rio's well aware of the delicate dance of pretending to be friendly with the people you can’t stand. But she still wishes, just once, that Agatha would drop the act and show some real emotion, like a normal person. Not some overpriced trinket you’d find in a palace gift shop. It’s really annoying. And Rio wants to see her crack. </p><p>“Do you ever get tired,” Rio says, “of playing the martyr in a room full of mirrors?”</p><p>Agatha turns and stares at her. “I’m not sure I follow.”</p><p>“Oh, come on, Your Highness,” Rio continues. “You’re out here acting like you’re above it all. Acting like you hate it, but it’s obvious you don’t. You carry yourself like you’re too good for all this, but somehow, you always find yourself right in the middle of it. Doesn’t it get exhausting? Pretending you don’t give a fuck when it’s clear you do?”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curl into a tight smile, but there’s no warmth in it. “And what exactly would you know about me,” she says coolly as she steps a little closer. </p><p>Rio raises an eyebrow, not the slightest bit fazed. “You’ve got the same insecurities as everyone else. The only difference is, you hide behind your title and act like it doesn’t bother you.” She takes a slow sip of her drink, keeping her eyes locked on Agatha’s. “But I see through it.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t react and just glanced at Rio’s almost-empty glass. </p><p>“How many of those have you had?” </p><p>“Not enough.” Rio lifted her glass. “But that’s the beauty of democracy, I can have as many as I want.”</p><p>Agatha let out a small hum, like that answer was exactly what she expected. </p><p>“Should’ve known, really.”</p><p>“Should’ve known what?”</p><p>“That your opinions alone are quite the entertainment.”</p><p>“I’m just saying, drop the act and actually enjoy yourself for once. It’s not that hard,” Rio says, casually resting an overly familiar elbow on Agatha’s shoulder. </p><p>It’s a bit ridiculous, especially with both of them in fancy gowns, but somehow, it feels like the only way to get her point across. Agatha flinches a bit, clearly uncomfortable. Lucky for them, no one seems to be paying attention to their little exchange.</p><p>Agatha forces a smile, gracefully brushing Rio's elbow off her shoulder. “Perhaps it’s time for you to switch to water, Miss Vidal,” she says, “And if you’re feeling a bit...unwell, I could have someone call your security detail. You do seem to be enjoying the champagne a little too much.” </p><p>Rio laughs softly, unbothered, and straightens up. “Oh, don’t worry. I’m perfectly fine,” she says, taking another slow sip of her drink. “Or is this just your way of trying to get rid of me? Am I bothering you, Princess?” She gives Agatha a look, her brown orbs turning as sweetly innocent as she can manage. “My sincerest apologies if I’m not fawning over you like the rest of the crowd. I can imagine it’s a bit perplexing for you.”</p><p>“You know what,” Agatha says, “I do think you are. Fawning over me more than anyone else in this room. In fact, you’re more fixated on me than anyone else here, aren't you?”</p><p>Rio’s mouth hangs open, while the corner of Agatha’s twists into a smug, almost cruel smile.</p><p>“Just an observation,” Agatha says, stepping a little closer, her presence suddenly a bit too much. “Have you ever noticed how I’ve never once gone out of my way to approach you? How have I been nothing but polite every time we’ve spoken? And yet, here you are, coming over to me again. It’s like you can’t get enough of me.” She takes a slow sip of her champagne, eyes locked on Rio’s. “It’s probably just nothing but it’s something I’ve noticed.”</p><p>“What? I’m not–” Rio stutters, thrown off by the unexpected confrontation. “You’re just so–”</p><p>“Enjoy your evening, Miss Vidal,” Agatha interrupts. She turns and walks away, her back straight, leaving Rio standing there, speechless.</p><p>It absolutely gnaws at Rio that Agatha thinks she gets to have the last say, like she’s some untouchable monarch and Rio is just supposed to curtsy and move on. Well, with champagne literally flowing through her system, she decides she’s fresh out of curtsies. Before she can talk herself out of it, her hand moves on its own, grabbing Agatha’s arms and pulling her right back. “Wait, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha spins around so fast that Rio nearly stumbles, and for a split second, she swears Agatha might actually shove her this time. But then, there it is. A flash of something unguarded in Agatha’s eyes, a flash of fire beneath all that icy composure. And against all logic, Rio finds herself quite intrigued. Because for the first time tonight, Agatha Harkness looks like a real person instead of a perfectly sculpted marble statue.</p><p>One second, Rio is standing. The next, she’s tripping over her own damn heels, lurching backward with all the grace of a baby giraffe on roller skates. She reaches out instinctively, grabs the first thing within reach, which, unfortunately, happens to be Agatha. </p><p>But instead of regaining balance, all she does is yank the princess off balance, and together they go stumbling straight into the nearest table. </p><p>The table. The one supporting the architectural wonder of royal indulgence.</p><p>The royal wedding cake, a towering, seven-tier, £65,000 sugar-coated flex of the monarchy, starts wobbling ominously. Rio watches in frozen horror as it trembles, sways, considers holding itself together…and then gives up on life entirely.</p><p>The first tier goes. Then the second. Then the third. The whole thing wobbles like a skyscraper in an earthquake before, inevitably, it gives in to gravity. The inevitable happens, and Rio and Agatha are right in the danger zone as the cake spectacularly collapses. </p><p>A tidal wave of white buttercream, fondant, sugar flowers, and pure, aristocratic regret crashes down on them in a glorious, frosted apocalypse. The weight of it fully knocks Rio off her feet. And somewhere beneath the carnage, Agatha makes a sound, one Rio can’t quite decipher through the ringing mortification in her ears.</p><p>Silence follows. A deep, stunned, oh-shit kind of silence. Then, all at once: a chorus of gasps. And a strangled shriek from what is likely the wedding planner seconds away from quitting on the spot. </p><p>For a moment, all Rio can do is lie there, staring up at the grand painting on the ceiling, absolutely drenched in the very same overpriced frosting she’d been mocking hours ago. The irony is almost impressive. At least if she does commit arson in Buckingham Palace, it won’t be the biggest scandal tied to this royal wedding.</p><p>Rio’s next, more immediate thought is that her mother, all the way back in the land of the free (and most likely Lilia too), is absolutely going to hang her upside down, skin her alive, or straight-up execute her on the White House lawn. <em> So much for diplomatic training. </em></p><p>Then, out of the corner of her eye, Rio catches a glimpse of Agatha. A small cut is now present across her cheekbone, likely from the shattered champagne glass. Just as Rio registers it, she hears her mutter, “Oh, for fuck’s sake.”</p><p>It’s the first time Rio has ever heard the princess swear. She barely has time to process it before a number of camera flashes go off. Blinking through the buttercream now plastered to her eyelashes, Rio exhales and licks a bit of frosting off her lip.</p><p>“Well,” she says, apologetic. “At least it’s not dry.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>The first thing Rio does after stepping off a transatlantic flight, jet-lagged, and still vaguely smelling like buttercream, is get smacked in the face with reality. More specifically, reality comes in the form of a foot-and-a-half stack of tabloids being dropped onto the massive mahogany desk right in front of her with a loud thud. </p><p>“That,” Lilia announces, adjusting her glasses with the kind of disapproval only a woman who has worked in politics for two decades can muster, “is everything I’ve had the displeasure of finding just this morning on my way to work. And these are just the printed copies. I didn’t even have the heart to ask my assistant what the internet is saying.”</p><p>“Oh, they’ve got plenty to say,” Rio quips as her mother’s ever-terrifying chief of staff looms over her like a general about to rip into a very disappointing soldier. Lilia shoots her a look that says Rio doesn’t even have the right to breathe wrong, let alone complain. Hell, she hasn’t even sat down yet. Hasn’t even had a real meal that didn’t come in a sad little paper box at 35,000 feet.</p><p>Isabel Vidal, President of the United States, the most powerful woman in the world, and the second most terrifying woman in this room, doesn’t even glance up from the document she’s signing. “Don’t even start,” she says in that clipped tone that means <em> I have no time for your theatrics today, Rio. </em></p><p>Rio, of course, immediately snaps her mouth shut and glares at the headlines sprawled across the stack of papers in front of her.</p><p><b>“LET THEM EAT CAKE? MORE LIKE LET THEM WEAR IT.”</b> – The New York Times</p><p><b>“FALL OF THE MONARCHY? NO, JUST THE CAKE.” </b>– The Wall Street Journal</p><p><b>“HOW TO WRECK A </b> <b> <em>£</em> </b> <b>65K CAKE AND NEARLY REIGNITE THE AMERICAN-BRITISH RIVALRY IN UNDER TEN SECONDS.”</b> – USA Today</p><p><b>“DID THE FIRST DAUGHTER JUST DECLARE WAR ON DESSERT?” </b>– The Post</p><p><b>“THE GREAT ROYAL BAKE-OOPS: HOW AMERICA’S SWEETHEART RIO VIDAL ENDED UP £65K IN DEBT TO THE CROWN.”</b> – Los Angeles Times </p><p>Each article comes with a different shot of the catastrophe, but the one that really grabs Rio’s attention is a shot of her and Agatha sprawled on the floor, knee-deep in royal frosting carnage.</p><p>Rio’s face is smeared with buttercream, her dress is a lost cause, and her hair is beyond saving. Her hand is still gripping Agatha’s arm, whether for balance or sheer disbelief is unclear. </p><p>While Agatha, somehow, is still holding onto the shattered stem of her champagne glass like it’s the last shred of her dignity. Her once-pristine face is streaked with icing, and her purple satin dress pools around her like she’s sitting on a very expensive, very undignified cloud of frosting.</p><p>After skimming a few headlines, Rio looks up and Lilia is already staring her down like this meeting is just the warm-up for the real scolding coming later. Rio has seen Lilia turn grown men into stammering wrecks with nothing more than a single glance and a raised brow. </p><p>But she knows that underneath all that iron-clad professionalism, Lilia has a soft spot for her somewhere. Probably buried under six feet of national security briefings and pure hatred for bad press. Right now, though, Lilia does not look soft. Not even close. She looks like she’s deciding whether to lecture Rio or just throw her out the nearest window.</p><p>But it’s not Lilia Rio is most worried about. No, that would be her mother.</p><p>President Isabel Vidal doesn’t yell. She doesn’t need to. She simply picks up a newspaper from the pile of articles spread across her desk and reads aloud.</p><p>“Sources say Princess Agatha and First Daughter Rio Vidal were seen in a tense exchange just minutes before the £65,000 wedding cake came crashing down, now being dubbed <b>The Great Cake Collapse</b>. Witnesses claim that the young American had one too many drinks, while the British princess looked noticeably uncomfortable.” </p><p>Isabel glances up, leveling Rio with a look.</p><p>Rio slouches back in her chair. “Okay, but in my defense, the floor was also very slippery–”</p><p>“Rio Celeste Vidal,” Isabel says, raising a finger, “speak only when it’s your turn.”</p><p>And Rio, wisely, shuts her mouth.</p><p>
  <span>“But sources within the royal household suggest that this wasn’t an isolated incident. According to a well-placed insider, friction between the two have been simmering since a UN summit over two years ago. With the press constantly pitting them against each other, was this an unfortunate accident? Or the latest battle in a long-brewing cold war between the White House and the monarchy?” Isabel finally folds the newspaper and waits.</span>
</p><p>Rio crosses her arms. “She started it!”</p><p>Lilia makes a half scoff, half repressed scream, and flips open one of the files as if she’s about to pull out a PowerPoint presentation on why that answer is utterly unacceptable.</p><p>Isabel barely reacts. “Darling, as much as I love you…and as your mother, I’m genuinely relieved to hear that you might not have started this mess,” she says evenly. “But we both know the press, and everyone outside this room, couldn’t care less about that.”</p><p>And that, that right there, is what stings the most.</p><p>Because Rio remembers being eight, sitting in the principal’s office with bruised knuckles while her mom stood beside her, shutting down every teacher who tried to pin the blame on her. Back then, Isabel was just Mom, the one person who always had her back. Now, she’s Madam President. And the President of the United States doesn’t get to play favorites.</p><p>“Fine, Mom. What do you want me to do?” Rio exhales, arms still crossed.</p><p>Isabel pulls open a drawer, grabs a folder, and drops it in front of her 28-year-old gremlin. Judging by the look on Lilia’s face, it’s clear she had a hand in this too. “Since I have an actual country to run and literally zero time to deal with this right now, this is what you’re going to do.”</p><p>Rio flips through the folder, eyes narrowing at the colorful tabs. “What’s this?” </p><p>“You, darling,” Isabel continues, “are going to smooth things over with Princess Agatha. You’re going to be civil, put on a show for the cameras, and convince the world that the President’s daughter and the beloved British princess are not, in fact, on the verge of an international incident. You’re flying to England on Friday, and you will spend the whole weekend there.” </p><p>Rio gapes. “I’m sorry, how is that supposed to fix anything?”</p><p>But Isabel ignores her and stands, smoothing out invisible wrinkles in her blazer. “No buts, no arguments, no last-minute escape plans, and absolutely no more headlines that make me regret every decision that led to having a child in the public eye. And I say this with all the love in the world,” she adds, pressing a quick kiss to Rio’s temple.</p><p>Rio groans, throwing up her hands. “Mom, is there seriously no other way to fix this?”</p><p>Isabel, already turning away, doesn’t bother answering. “Lilia will brief you on the details,” she says instead. “I still have a hundred meetings to get through, and you have two days to get your act together.” She then reaches the door, pauses just long enough to glance back. “I’m counting on you, Rio. Let’s keep the disasters to a minimum, okay?”</p><p>And just like that, she’s gone.</p><p>Before Rio can even let out another groan in protest, a folder smacks her square in the head. “You reckless, reckless idiot! What on earth possessed you to drown yourself in champagne at a fucking royal wedding?!” Lilia fumes, punctuating each word with another swat of the folder.</p><p>“Ow – Lilia!” Rio yelps, scrambling away as Lilia advances. “Quit it!”</p><p>“What did I tell you about drinking on the job?”</p><p>“I wasn’t even on the clock! It was a party!” Rio argues, but Lilia just smacks her with the folder. Again. And again. “Okay, fine! Technically, I was on the job, but –”</p><p>“Do you have any idea how much damage control this has required?” Lilia cuts her off, finally giving up on chasing Rio around the room. With an exhausted sigh, she drops into the chair Isabel had vacated, rubbing her temples like she can already feel the migraine forming.</p><p>Lilia may not be the most powerful person in the White House, but she’s been by Isabel’s side since Rio was nine, back when her mother was just a rising star in Delaware politics. At this point, Lilia is less of a chief of staff and more of a second mother, the only person truly capable of keeping the First Family in line, especially Rio.</p><p>Rio also sinks into the chair across from her, drumming her fingers against the armrest. “Look, I get it. Bad optics. International humiliation. Very dramatic headlines.” She tilts her head. “But let’s be real, the only reason anyone cares this much is because it was Princess Agatha under that cake with me.”</p><p>Lilia gives her a withering look. “Yes. Because that argument makes it better.”</p><p>“All I’m saying is, if it had been some random earl, viscount, duchess, or whatever, no one would still be talking about it. And for the record, this wasn’t even entirely my fault. It was Agatha’s. She should be the one getting dragged in the tabloids. Not me, and definitely not the entire U.S. government.”</p><p>Lilia pinches the bridge of her nose, like she’s summoning patience from the depths of her soul. </p><p>“Yes, fine. The pretty British princess is to blame. Duly noted. But that doesn’t change the fact that you’re the one who has to fix this. And you’re going to handle it exactly as I tell you to, because I spent the entire night doing damage control to make this happen. So you’re going to stick to the plan and not tank it, because I am far too old, far too underpaid, and far too tired to be cleaning up after you. Understood, kiddo?”</p><p>Rio still thinks the whole plan is absurd, but she nods.</p><p>“Just so you know, I’m not a kid anymore. But okay, fine.” </p><p>Lilia eyes her like she’s just agreed to set fire to a diplomatic treaty but moves on anyway.</p><p>“The official story that the White House and the Crown will release is that the whole thing was a complete accident and an unfortunate misunderstanding–”</p><p>“That’s exactly what happened,” Rio inserts.</p><p>“–and that, despite both your demanding schedules, you and Princess Agatha have been longtime close friends.”</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Rio scoffs. “What do you mean longtime close friends? I literally met her two years ago.”</span>
</p><p>“And in that time, the internet and postal service have very much existed. So as far as the world is concerned, you two are practically besties. I don’t care if that means swapping postcards, emails, or messages via carrier pigeon – this is the story we’re running with.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t respond, just sinks deeper into her chair, rubbing at her temples. Now she’s the one with a migraine forming. Lilia watches her for a moment before sighing, her attitude softening just a little as she grabs a glass of water and sets it in front of her. </p><p>“Listen,” she says, “the White House and the Crown need to come out of this with their reputations intact, and the only way that happens is if your little wedding cake fiasco gets reframed as harmless, totally-not-hostile, rich-girl antics. Got it?” </p><p>Lilia gives Rio another pointed look. “So you can loathe the heir to the throne all you want, dedicate entire pages of your burn book to her–”</p><p>“Agatha’s the spare, not the heir. And I don’t have a burn book.”</p><p>“–but the second a camera is on you both, you act like she’s your fucking favorite person on the planet. Hell, you act like she cured your seasonal depression. And you fucking sell it.”</p><p>Rio groans, tipping her head back against the chair. “Great. So, somehow my punishment for a crime I didn’t entirely commit is an international PR stunt where I pretend to adore a woman who probably wants me exiled.”</p><p>Lilia smirks, folding her arms. “Welcome to diplomacy, kiddo.”</p><p>Rio glares at her. “I hate it here.”</p><p>“You and half of Congress,” Lilia says, unimpressed. “But unlike them, I actually have the power to make you fix this before you torpedo your mother’s reelection campaign. Do you really want her on that debate stage next year, trying to convince the world her own daughter didn’t just set fire to international relations?”</p><p>Rio presses her lips together. She doesn’t. And deep down, she knows she’s been reacting, not thinking. If she weren’t so blinded by her annoyance, or disdain, or whatever this mess of a feeling toward Agatha is, she probably would have landed on the same solution herself.</p><p>“So, as I've said,” Lilia continues, businesslike. “From now on, Princess Agatha is your closest and dearest friend. You’ll do charity events together, make nice for the cameras, and if anyone asks about her, I expect you to talk like she’s the goddamn love of your life.”</p><p>Rio scoffs, faking a gag.</p><p>Lilia doesn’t so much as blink, sliding a hefty folder in front of her, stuffed with meticulous bullet points and an army of color-coded tabs. Stamped across the cover in bold letters: <b>EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT PRINCESS AGATHA.</b></p><p>“Learn it. Every detail. Every bullet. Everything,” Lilia instructs. “Because when the press starts digging, and they will, you need to have your facts straight.”</p><p>Rio flips it open, skimming the <em> Interests </em> section: Polo. Horseback riding. Hunting. <em> Jesus fucking Christ. </em> She’s going to die in England. </p><p>Rio lifts the folder, eyebrows raised. “Does she get one of these on me too?”</p><p>“Yes,” Lilia confirms. “And for the record, putting it together was a new low in my career.”</p><p>Another folder slides across the desk. This one is marked <em> Weekend Itinerary </em>.</p><p>Rio sighs, rubbing her temples. “Okay, but why am I the one flying over there? Shouldn’t she be the one coming here? Considering she practically shoved me into that fucking expensive cake.” </p><p>“Language, kid. You kiss your mother with that mouth?” Lilia warns. </p><p>Rio gasps, scandalized. Of all people, Lilia is the last one who should be policing her mouth, she practically taught her half the curses she knows. </p><p>But before Rio can call her out, Lilia moves on. “It was their royal wedding you upstaged, and they’re the ones out sixty-five thousand pounds, so you’re going to them. Besides, we’re already arranging for her to attend a state dinner in a few months. Trust me, that little bitch is just as thrilled about this as you are.”</p><p>Lilia stands, “Anyway, like your mother said, you leave Friday. So, pack accordingly…”</p><p>“Wait,” Rio cuts in, frowning. “If I’m gone all weekend, what about my job? My classes?”</p><p>“Already handled. The hospital and university have been informed.” Lilia checks her watch, then levels Rio with a warning look. “As I was saying, pack appropriately. And by that, I mean nothing that makes you look like you just crawled out of a dive bar.”</p><p>Rio throws up her hands. “Oh, so now my wardrobe is a national security issue?”</p><p>“Sweetheart, your entire existence is a national security issue. Let’s not make it worse.”</p><p>With that, Lilia tucks her folder under her arm and strides toward the door, leaving Rio slumped at the desk, staring into the void.</p><hr /><p>Rio is seven hours deep into this flight, and she’s bored out of her mind.</p><p>Which is probably why she’s currently sitting upside down in her seat, legs hooked over the backrest, head dangling dangerously close to the floor as she flips through the thick, stapled packet in her hands, Everything You Need To Know About Princess Agatha, or as she’s mentally renamed it: The Agatha Harkness Cheat Sheet.</p><p>The blood rushes to her head, making the words blur slightly. Probably not great. Probably not safe to be doing this in a moving aircraft, but whatever. If she dies, at least she won’t have to make small talk with Her Royal Frostiness when she lands.</p><p>She flips a page, revealing straightforward facts and a bunch of pictures.</p><p>
  <em> Agatha Victoria Eleanor Harkness, Princess of the United Kingdom...yada yada...second in line to the throne, unless her brother decides to start popping out heirs...elite equestrian...plays polo…expert at hunting, shot her first pheasant at age eight...speaks four languages, including Latin, because, of course, she does...supporter of fifteen charities, co-founder of two more – </em>
</p><p>Rio scoffs, then spots a fun little tidbit: <em> has a pet rabbit named Señor Scratchy. </em> She snorts, earning a few curious glances from her security detail. “Señor Scratchy? Who even names their pet Señor Scratchy?” she mutters, imagining Agatha with some fluffy, well-behaved sidekick. She glances back at the page: <em> enjoys quiet time with her rabbit after royal events.  </em></p><p>“Maybe I should get a rabbit,” she muses. “Probably be good for my own personal crisis management.” Just as Rio’s considering how much longer she can stay upside down before her brain actually explodes, her folder is yanked right out of her hands.</p><p>“Hey!” she protests, flailing, nearly toppling over before she’s forced to right herself.</p><p>Alice, sitting with military precision in the seat next to her, flips through the fact sheet with an unimpressed look. “You’re going to look like someone who’d order me around to paint the white roses red, and shout ‘Off with their heads!’ by the time we arrive at Kensington Palace.” She gestures vaguely at Rio’s face. “You’re already halfway there.”</p><p>Rio swipes a hand across her forehead. “Am I actually red?”</p><p>Alice ignores the question, snapping the folder shut. “Alright, pop quiz. Lilia said you’ve been studying for two days. Let’s see what you’ve actually retained.”</p><p>Rio groans. “Seriously?”</p><p>Alice doesn’t budge. “Seriously.”</p><p>Rio flops dramatically against the seat. “Fine. Hit me.”</p><p>Alice smirks. “Her full name?”</p><p>“Princess Elsa of Arendelle?” Rio shrugs, playing innocent.</p><p>Alice only raises a brow. </p><p>“Alright, fine.” Rio crosses her arms. “You don’t have to be so serious about it. It’s Agatha Victoria Eleanor Harkness, but honestly, <em> Princess Sub-Zero </em>suits her way better.”</p><p>Alice sighs. “Parents?” </p><p>“Her mother is Queen Evanora Harkness, eldest daughter of the late King George and the first queen to earn a double doctorate or something equally terrifying,” Rio recites, “Her father is the late Prince Consort Damian Voss, former Oxford history professor who met the queen during a guest lecture. He passed away about two years ago.” </p><p>“Okay,” Alice nods and flips another page. “What’s her equestrian specialty?”</p><p>“Show jumping,” Rio answers immediately. Then, begrudgingly, “And she’s apparently annoyingly good at it.”</p><p>Alice leans in. “Alright, here’s another one for you. What’s the name of her best friend? Other than you now, of course,” she teases.</p><p>“Ha-ha, hilarious,” Rio deadpans. “I highly doubt that human ice sculpture even has a friend,” she scoffs, only to yelp when Alice smacks the folder against her shoulder.</p><p>“Ow! Okay, fine,” she grumbles. “Best friend’s name is Jennifer Kale, heir to the Kale Global Shipping and Trade Conglomerate in Florida. Met Agatha at some fancy all-girls boarding school.” She pauses, then smirks. “Out of all the posh British girls, she picks an American to be her bestie? Almost admirable.”</p><p>Alice flips to another page. “Besides charity work, horseback riding, hunting, and polo, what’s her other favorite hobby?”</p><p>Rio frowns, clearly stumped. “Uh, I don’t know. Knitting?”</p><p>Alice shakes her head. “Not even close. Though she tried it when she was thirteen, got a scar on her elbow, and never picked up a pair of needles again.” She skims further down. “Anyway, apparently, aside from her usual hobbies, she’s really into reading.”</p><p>“Of course, she is,” Rio scoffs. “Never beating the cold, distant, <em> and boring </em> allegations.”</p><p>Alice ignores that. “Which brings me to my next question. What’s her favorite book?”</p><p>Rio shrugs. “I don’t know? How to Look Emotionally Unavailable for Dummies?”</p><p>Alice smacks her arm this time.</p><p>“Aren’t you supposed to be my security detail?” Rio protests, rubbing her arm. “And for the record, I really don’t know.” </p><p>Alice sighs. “It’s Anna Karenina.”</p><p>Rio stares at her for a beat before bursting into laughter. “Are you serious?”</p><p>“I’m dead serious.” Alice taps a page with her finger. “Out of all the books, her favorite is about a woman who runs off with the love of her life, only to realize the world won’t accept it, and then she suffers the tragic consequences.” She lets out a low whistle. “Your new best friend has quite a thing for doomed love stories.” </p><p>“Again, she’s not my new best friend,” Rio argues quickly, “and I’m never going to be friends with someone with that taste.”</p><p>Alice flips through more pages. “You know, Lilia really went all out on this. It’s insanely detailed. Now I’m dying to know what she put in your files. Agatha’s probably digging through them too.” </p><p>Rio was just as curious. What had Lilia put in her file that Agatha might have been reading over the past few days? Oh god, what if Lilia included everything? </p><p>Like that awkward photo from prom with a guy named Dick Hardman. Or the time she had braces and totally ignored the whole retainer thing, leaving her with a permanent gap in her teeth. Or the time she tried to play saxophone in her high school band and got straight-up booed off the stage. Meanwhile, Agatha was a literal prodigy at everything. And the last thing Rio wants is for her so-called nemesis to see her as a complete loser. No way in hell was she letting Agatha have that kind of ammo.</p><hr /><p>By the time they pull up to Kensington Palace, Rio already feels the headache forming behind her temples. It’s not just the jet lag, the lack of sleep, or the deeply concerning amount of British press waiting outside. It’s the fact that she has to spend an entire weekend playing nice with the very last person she wants to see.</p><p>The Bentley rolls to a stop, and Rio barely gets a second to take in the place, old fancy brick, perfectly trimmed gardens, and the whole royal deal, before the gates swing open. Standing there is a young man, probably a few years her junior, dressed in a crisp suit, his curly hair is neatly in place, and is quite lanky in a way that suggests he either fences or just forgets to eat.</p><p>“Miss Vidal, Agent Gulliver. Welcome to Kensington Palace. I trust your flight was pleasant,” he greets with a polite nod. “I'm William Kaplan, but feel free to call me Billy. I serve as Her Royal Highness's equerry.” Then, turning to Alice, he adds, “The bullet-proof Bentley is reserved for Miss Vidal, while the Rover will be at your team’s disposal for the duration of your stay.”</p><p>Alice nods, but before Billy can continue, Rio squints her eyes at him. “Equerry?” She gives him a once-over. “Aren’t you a little too fresh-faced to have that job?”</p><p>Billy’s lips twitch, but he doesn’t rise to the bait. “I am, actually. But I graduated ahead of my peers. Accelerated program.” Then, without missing a beat, he moves on. “You’ll be staying here at Kensington for the weekend, as per the arrangement. You and your security team will have designated suites in the south wing of the palace.”</p><p>“I don’t really care where you put me, as long as it’s not across the hall from Her Royal Highness,” Rio mutters. Alice promptly kicks her ankle.</p><p>Billy pointedly ignores the remark. “Dinner is set for precisely seven-thirty in the Blue Drawing Room, which, as always, is a formal affair in the palace.” His eyes flick down to Rio’s travel-worn jeans, scuffed leather jacket, even more scuffed boots, and the faded Nirvana T-shirt she clearly threw on in a hurry. When he looks back up, his face remains impeccably neutral. “A change of attire is strongly advised.”</p><p>Rio follows Billy’s gaze down to her own outfit, also doing a quick once-over with a barely concealed grimace. Okay, yeah, maybe she could’ve put a little more effort into not looking like she just got dragged through a transatlantic flight by her ankles. Not that she had much time to fix it between landing and getting hauled straight here.</p><p>She barely gets a word in before Billy steamrolls ahead. “Now, about your schedule this weekend. First, there will be a photo opportunity shortly, where Her Royal Highness will formally welcome you back to England.” He hands Rio and Alice a copy of the schedule. “Tomorrow morning, you and the Princess will be doing a series of interviews with select members of the press, handpicked by the Crown.” </p><p>His emphasis on <em> handpicked </em> is not lost on Rio. Translation: no chance for the young American to say something that will send Buckingham Palace into a collective aneurysm.</p><p>“There will also be a few additional photo ops at a public park in the afternoon, followed by a visit to St. Helena’s Children’s Center,” Billy continues. “It’s one of the charities Her Royal Highness is actively involved with, specializing in care for children with terminal illnesses.”</p><p>That actually makes Rio pause. She knew Agatha did her fair share of charity work, every royal did, but something about this visit feels different. Maybe it was Lilia’s idea, considering Rio’s job. And, if she’s being honest, it’s the one thing on the schedule she’s actually looking forward to.</p><p>Before she can dwell on it, Billy turns to her with an actual smile. For the first time, he actually looks his age, young enough that Rio can’t help but wonder if he still gets carded at bars.</p><p>“Any questions?” </p><p>Rio exhales through her nose as she glances around. “Alright, so where is Her Royal Frostiness? Shouldn’t she be here for the grand welcome?”</p><p>Billy doesn’t blink at the nickname. Either he’s too professional to react, or he’s heard worse. “Her Royal Highness is currently at the stables, finishing her equestrian practice. We’ll be heading there now for the photo op. The photographers are already in place.”</p><p>“Wait, like right now?” Rio gestures vaguely at herself. “I haven’t even changed yet.”</p><p>Billy offers a polite, entirely unmoved smile.</p><p>“Unfortunately, there’s no time. The press has been waiting for over an hour.”</p><p>Rio lets out a long-suffering groan but doesn’t argue as they’re ushered toward the waiting Bentley. Alice slides into the front seat while the rest of Rio’s security team follows in a black Rover, trailing closely behind.</p><p>Just as the car starts rolling forward, Billy reaches into his sleek leather portfolio and pulls out a document. “By the way, Miss Vidal,” he says, handing it over, “I need you to sign this before the weekend’s affairs officially begin.”</p><p>Rio eyes it warily. “What is it?”</p><p>“Just a standard non-disclosure agreement,” Billy replies. “As you’ll be spending the weekend in close quarters with Her Royal Highness, we require a non-disclosure agreement to ensure privacy. The usual: no unauthorized photographs, no recordings, no sharing of private conversations, and, of course, absolutely no leaking of internal schedules or security details. You’ll also refrain from discussing any matters pertaining to the Crown without prior approval. And most importantly, no engaging in behavior that could be considered unbecoming or inappropriate in the presence of the Princess.” </p><p>Rio squints at the last part. Unbecoming or inappropriate behavior? What exactly do they think she’ll be doing? It’s not like she’s some kind of wild animal or something. </p><p>Well, some might argue otherwise, under the right circumstances, behind closed doors, in a far more intimate setting. But she’s going to be behind closed doors with <em> Agatha, </em> and there is absolutely nothing intimate about that. Hell, it’s about as far from intimate as humanly possible.</p><p>“Right,” Rio drawls, flipping to the last page. “And what happens if I refuse?” </p><p>“Then I suppose we’ll have to turn the car around and inform the President that you are unable to fulfill your diplomatic obligations,” Billy replies, unbothered. Rio grits her teeth. This kid is really starting to get on her nerves.</p><p>“Fine,” Rio grumbles under her breath, grabs the pen he hands her, and scribbles down her signature. “Wouldn’t want to get thrown into the Tower of London or whatever.” </p><p>Billy hums, utterly unimpressed. “We don’t do that anymore.”</p><p>“Shame.”</p><hr /><p>The car slows as they approach the stables, and true to Billy’s word, a small crowd of photographers is already stationed by the fence. Rio sighs as she glances down at her Nirvana shirt and leather jacket again, then slides on her sunglasses with a resigned huff.</p><p>She feels ridiculously underdressed for this. But then again, Agatha is fresh from riding practice. Which means she’s probably sweaty, covered in dirt, and smelling like a horse. If the press is about to get a photo of them both looking like shit, Rio figures she can live with that.</p><p>Or at least, that’s what she thinks –</p><p>– right up until a certain someone rides into view.</p><p>A sleek black stallion emerges from the side of the stables, and perched atop it, like some kind of aristocratic fever dream, is Agatha. She’s dressed in a crisp white riding shirt tucked neatly into tailored beige jodhpurs that highlights her legs. A black riding jacket, fitted to perfection, and polished leather boots gleam under the late morning sun.</p><p>The horse slows as she nears, and just when Rio thinks it can’t possibly get worse, Agatha pulls off her helmet. A mess of dark brown hair spills free, slightly tousled from the ride, a few strands sticking to her forehead. The sunlight highlights her cheekbones, her jaw, and the striking ice-blue of her eyes. She’s flushed, and slightly breathless. Yet even like this, <em> especially </em> like this, she looks nothing short of immaculate.</p><p>Rio curses internally, biting back the urge to roll her eyes.</p><p>Because this? This is just unfair.</p><p>Agatha hands her helmet off to a nearby stable hand. Then, without hesitation, she swings her leg over the saddle and dismounts, her boots landing lightly on the dirt. She strides toward Rio. Even without a crown, she might as well be wearing one.</p><p>“Miss Vidal,” Agatha greets, making no real effort to hide the disdain in her voice. Well, at least she’s done pretending she doesn’t hate her. Rio can work with that. She likes it this way. “I must say, I almost didn’t recognize you without a drink in hand. Sobriety somehow suits you.” </p><p>“Given the downright unfortunate circumstances,” Rio quips, rolling her eyes, “and the nauseating fact that, to the rest of the world, we’re basically besties, I think it’s only fair we call each other by our first names.” </p><p>Agatha tilts her head, studying her with those annoyingly hypnotic ocean-blue eyes, and entirely too unreadable for Rio’s liking. Then, after a beat, she nods. Without breaking eye contact, she tugs off her riding gloves, one finger at a time, before extending a hand.</p><p>“Very well…Rio.”</p><p>And damn it. </p><p>Hearing her name for the first time in that annoyingly posh British accent, spoken in a voice just a bit lower than she expected, sends an entirely unwelcome little zap to her system. “This is a complete waste of time,” Rio grumbles, interlocking her fingers with Agatha’s before she can overthink it. With the royal photographers lingering just beyond the fence, she forces a bright smile and grits out, “Can’t wait for this weekend to be over.” </p><p>Agatha’s grip is firm, her skin irritatingly smooth despite the faint calluses from riding. And instead of letting go right away, she takes her time, giving Rio a slow, lingering once-over before drawling, “You Americans are always in such a rush. I was rather hoping we’d be braiding each other’s hair and swapping gossip over tea by the end of this.”</p><p>Rio scoffs, not exactly surprised that the princess is capable of sarcasm. “Yeah, well, hate to break it to you, Princess, but I forgot my friendship bracelets at the White House.”</p><p>Agatha snorts, but before either of them can land another jab, Billy and Alice, standing just behind them, pointedly clear their throats.</p><p>“If we’re all done exchanging pleasantries,” Alice begins.</p><p>“The photographers would like a few official shots of the Princess formally welcoming Miss Vidal back to England,” Billy finishes matter-of-factly.</p><p>Rio sighs through her nose and turns to face the cameras. She barely has time to school her face into something neutral before Agatha smoothly steps closer, angling her body ever so slightly in that way royals do when they’ve had years of training to look perfect in every photo.</p><p>“Try to look a little less miserable, dearest,” Agatha murmurs just loud enough for Rio to hear. “Wouldn’t want the whole world thinking America’s First Daughter has nothing but disdain for our dear jolly old England.”</p><p>Rio throws her head back in an exaggerated laugh, loud, fake, and absolutely dripping with sarcasm. She gives Agatha’s hand a tight squeeze, “Oh, bite me.”</p><p>Agatha barely reacts, her lips curving into something dangerously close to a smirk. “Tell me where,” she muses, finally letting go of Rio’s hand, “and perhaps I’ll consider it.” </p><p>Rio nearly chokes on her own breath. She opens her mouth, ready to snap back, but before she can, Billy steps in with perfect timing. </p><p>“Your Highness,” he says, eyes only on Agatha. “I believe the photographers have taken the required shots. Your ride back to Kensington is ready whenever you are.” </p><p>“Thank you, William,” Agatha says before turning to Rio again. She takes a beat longer, studying the other woman like she’s trying to decide about something just out of Rio’s reach. Then she smiles: polite, practiced, and utterly unreadable. “Shall we?”</p><p>Rio resists the urge to drag a hand down her face as Agatha strides off without a second glance. “How fast can I get to the Tower of London? And do they really let you jump, or is that–?" she mutters to Alice, falling into step beside her.</p><p>“Do it, and I might as well shove you myself,” Alice deadpans. She has utterly no clue what kind of cold war is brewing between the two, but she’s sure as hell it’s going to be a <em> very, very </em> long weekend.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>There are two things Rio is learning over the course of the most painfully silent dinner of her life.</p><p><b>One. </b>She might actually hate British food. Or, more likely, Agatha specifically curated tonight’s menu as some sort of passive-aggressive revenge. Because there is simply no other explanation for the lineup of horrors placed in front of her: black pudding, smoked eel, and something unidentifiable drowning in a suspiciously gelatinous sauce. Rio has always respected food. Never wasted a bite, never turned her nose up at a meal. But right now, all she wants to do is cry into her plate. </p><p>Maybe that NDA she signed this morning wasn’t about privacy at all. Maybe it was just Agatha covering her bases before finishing her off. And if Rio needed any proof, it’s right across the table: Agatha, eating with infuriating grace, taking delicate bites, sipping her wine, and not even bothering to hide how much she’s enjoying Rio’s suffering. </p><p><b>Two. </b>Agatha almost always eats dinner alone. Earlier, while ushering Rio to the drawing room, one staff member let it slip that Prince Edward’s old quarters were on the opposite side of the palace. <span>Now that he’s married and living at Highgrove, Agatha is pretty much the sole resident of this massive section of Kensington.</span></p><p>Rio glances around the room: the towering ceilings, the massive windows showing off the night sky, the candlelight reflecting off antique china, and a dining table so long it could host a small country’s parliament.</p><p>And then there’s Agatha. Sitting at one end, alone in a space meant for a crowd.</p><p>The thought of her eating like this every night is...kind of bleak. It’s almost sad. </p><p>Then Rio remembers the black pudding currently haunting her taste buds, wonders how many rounds of mouthwash it’ll take to erase it, and decides Agatha deserves every ounce of her solitude. </p><p>After dinner, Rio is ushered to her room in the south wing, better known as the guest wing, which is really just a polite way of saying far, far away from Agatha.</p><p>The moment she steps inside, she’s hit with that familiar, unsettling, ghostly feeling. The kind that clings to old buildings no matter how often they’re dusted, cleaned and polished. It’s the same feeling she gets at the White House. Too much history, too many ghosts – not the literal kind (probably), but the remnants of past lives lingering in the walls, in the antique furniture, and the quiet halls. And Rio hates it more than anything.</p><p>That’s why, whenever she doesn’t absolutely have to stay at the White House, she crashes at her own apartment in DC. A much smaller, much less haunted space near the hospital where she volunteers. Or, well, used to volunteer more often. Lately, with her schedule being swallowed by international relations classes at Georgetown, she’s barely been able to do rounds.</p><p>After her bath, Rio rolls onto the massive bed, burying herself in the ridiculously soft sheets. It should be perfect, should easily lull her right into sleep, but instead, she just stares at the ceiling. It’s because the whole place is unnaturally quiet, like the building itself is holding its breath.</p><p>She flips onto her side. Then her stomach. Then back. Then to her stomach. Then back to her back again. With a groan, she kicks off the blanket, grabs her glasses from the bedside table, and gets up, padding barefoot across the cold floor.</p><p>The kitchen in her wing is just as over-the-top as the rest of the place: marble counters, spotless cabinets, and a fridge that probably holds things like fancy truffle butter and some kind of overpriced elderflower syrup. Not exactly great for a midnight snack.</p><p>Instead of hunting for food, she snatches her phone off the counter. It's past midnight here, which means it's probably around 5 PM back home. She dials, tapping her fingers against the marble as it rings once. Twice. And then –</p><p>“Why aren’t you asleep?”</p><p>Lilia’s voice cuts through the line, like she already knows Rio’s up to something.</p><p>Rio leans against the counter. “Well,” she drawls, “maybe I was hoping you had some last-minute pointers for tomorrow’s interview.” Rio immediately hears Lilia sigh on the other end. </p><p>“You’ve had the briefing packet for days, Rio.”</p><p>“Yeah, and I’ve read it.” Rio traces a finger along the cool marble counter, pretending to inspect her nails. “But surely there’s something else. Something only you would know.”</p><p>Lilia sighs in that long-suffering way of hers. “Like what?”</p><p>Rio then twirls a grape between her fingers. “Oh, I don’t know. Whether she secretly believes the earth is flat? Or if she sits dangerously close to her cutlery during dinners?”</p><p>Another long pause. Then, “Why do I even try?”</p><p>Rio grins, plopping the grape into her mouth. “Because you love me.”</p><p>“I tolerate you,” Lilia corrects. “And if you actually did read the briefing, then you already know tomorrow is not that difficult. It’s a joint press appearance. Simple. Just a harmless, friendly engagement with the princess.” A pointed pause. “Which means?”</p><p>“No instigating,” Rio recites, already hearing the speech in her head. “No sarcasm, no passive-aggressive comments, and absolutely no causing trouble.”</p><p>“Exactly.”</p><p>Rio bites her lip, considering. “What if <em> she </em> instigates?”</p><p>“She won’t.”</p><p>“She might.”</p><p>“She won’t,” Lilia repeats. “She’s a professional.”</p><p>Rio snorts. “She’s a princess.”</p><p>“Which means she knows better than to pick a fight on live television,” Lilia counters. “Unlike some people I know.”</p><p>Rio smirks but doesn’t argue. Because, fine. Maybe she has a teeny tendency to push buttons. Lilia must sense it, because she adds, “She’s been in the public eye since birth, sweetheart. She’s not about to let you drag her into some petty argument on live TV.”</p><p>Rio makes a face, “Petty is a strong word.”</p><p>“So is bad publicity,” Lilia counters. “I’m just reminding you that your mother has enough on her plate as it is.” She pauses, then adds, “The last thing she needs is another headline about her daughter feuding with a royal over something completely ridiculous like…” She trails off. “Actually, what would the two of you even argue about?”</p><p>Rio adjusts the glasses perched on her nose. “Cake?”</p><p>Lilia groans like she regrets ever picking up the phone.</p><p>“Alright, alright,” Rio concedes, stretching an arm over the counter. “No trouble, I promise. I’ll be the picture of diplomatic grace.”</p><p>“I’ll believe it when I see it.” A pause. Then, softer, “Now get some sleep, kid.”</p><p>Rio hums in acknowledgment, though she’s not convinced it’ll happen. “Night, Lilia.” </p><p>She hangs up, places her phone face down on the counter, and reaches for the fridge, ready to pour herself a glass of milk. But before she can even grab the handle, she hears quiet footsteps approaching from the dim corridor just outside the kitchen.</p><p>From what she was told, it’s just her, Alice, and the rest of her security detail in this wing. No one else should be wandering around. Especially at this hour. And sure, this kitchen is technically attached to her suite, but it’s also separate enough that anyone could slip in unnoticed. </p><p>Her first thought is a ghost. Because, of course, an old palace like this would be haunted. She’s been in enough historical buildings to know when a place has that feeling.</p><p>But then, her second, more concerning thought is an actual intruder.</p><p>Because, well, one of the little fun facts she learned before arriving here: Kensington Palace has had a concerning number of undocumented security breaches over the years. Not everyone makes it into the headlines. Some politically motivated, some just to snoop around, and others with much worse and deranged intentions.</p><p>She lets go of the fridge handle and, without thinking, grabs the nearest thing that could pass as a weapon: a butter knife from the block on the counter. Whether it’ll actually help her defend herself is anyone’s guess, but right now, she just needs something to fucking hold on to.</p><p>The footsteps get closer. Then, a light clicks on in the hallway. What kind of intruder bothers to turn on the lights? But Rio still braces herself – and then, just like that, Agatha steps into the kitchen.</p><p>Completely barefoot, hair a tousled mess, like she’s been tossing and turning in bed. She was not in some regal silk robe or one of those perfectly tailored dresses she wears in public, but in matching chartreuse pajamas. Rio holds her breath as Agatha pads across the cold tile floor, yawning like she either just woke up or never really fallen asleep.</p><p>Rio blinks. She was fully prepared to face a ghost, a rogue intruder, or maybe even a serial killer. But not Agatha, looking like an actual person who maybe drools on her pillow at night. So, Rio just stares. Because for the first time since she got here, or maybe for the first time ever, Agatha, second in line to the British throne, looks terrifyingly…human. </p><p>Agatha doesn’t even notice her at first, moving on autopilot as she reaches for a cupboard. Rio, still clutching her wildly ineffective butter knife, watches as Agatha stretches up to grab something. And that’s when Rio’s fingers betray her.</p><p>The knife hits the counter.</p><p>Agatha freezes, her eyes locking onto Rio, who’s already staring right back at her. For a second, neither of them moves. Then Agatha clears her throat, immediately straightens her spine, and, just like that, she’s a princess again. “You’re awake,” she says. Something about the hoarseness of it scratches at a weird part of Rio’s brain. </p><p>“I could say the same to you,” Rio replies, eyeing the way Agatha hesitates, like she’s debating just turning around and walking right out.</p><p>“I was just…” Agatha starts, then abruptly finishes with, “Hartley’s.”</p><p>Rio squints. “What?”</p><p>Agatha finally grabs what she came for: a small plastic container from the cupboard. She holds it up like it’s supposed to explain everything. “Jelly pots,” she says, tilting the label toward Rio, the words <em> Hartley’s </em> printed across it. “I ran out. Thought I’d find some here.”</p><p>Rio looks at the container, then back at Agatha. “You’re telling me you came all the way down here at one in the morning, for jelly?” She pauses, then adds dryly, “Should I list ‘stealing from your guest’s kitchen’ as one of your hobbies in tomorrow’s interview?”</p><p>“I just assumed you’d be asleep,” Agatha counters, “And for the record, it’s not stealing. Everything in this wing technically belongs to me...so really, I’m just helping myself.”</p><p>Rio keeps staring at Agatha. Not even so much as an apology for nearly giving her a heart attack. Weren’t royals supposed to have good manners hammered into them at those fancy boarding schools?</p><p>Then Agatha's eyes land on the discarded knife on the counter, "Next time, maybe reach for something more intimidating, something that doesn’t belong in a toddler’s tea set," she says dryly, before reaching into the cupboard and casually tossing something to Rio.</p><p>Rio barely catches it, frowning down at the small plastic cup in her hands. “I don’t like strawberries,” she mutters. </p><p>“Really?” Agatha raises a brow. “Must’ve missed that on your fact sheet.” Then wordlessly swaps it out for another flavor. Something green. Lemon and lime, according to the label.</p><p>Rio wants to reject it just to be petty. Deny Agatha the satisfaction after that <em> delightful </em> dinner earlier. An American refusing a royal’s offering? That has to bruise her ego at least a little. But Rio, forever the innate people pleaser, begrudgingly takes it. “Thanks,” she mumbles.</p><p>Agatha grabs a spoon, peels back the lid, and digs in. Rio watches her, half expecting her to take the jelly and go, but Agatha stays. Just standing there, eating jelly straight from the cup like a normal human being. Rio finds it weirdly unsettling. Agatha isn’t supposed to look normal.</p><p>After a beat, Agatha finally speaks again. “Why are you still awake?”</p><p>“I was just calling someone,” Rio replies, popping the lid off her own jelly. “You? Why aren’t you in bed?”</p><p>“Can’t sleep.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t elaborate, so Rio just hums in acknowledgment.</p><p>Then Agatha shifts, glancing at her. “Do you want to practice?”</p><p>Rio pauses mid-spoonful. “What?”</p><p>“For tomorrow.” Agatha twirls her spoon absentmindedly. “I could ask you some questions, and you could ask me. Like a practice run.”</p><p>Rio squints. Is she serious? Is this even Agatha she’s talking to? Or does the royal family actually have body doubles? Or clones, like those wild Reddit rumors? But then she notices the small cut on Agatha’s cheekbone, a souvenir from their cake fiasco last week. She hadn’t caught it earlier, maybe because this is the first time Agatha’s been completely barefaced, looking less like a perfectly polished royal and more like a person.</p><p>“I think I’ll pass,” Rio says finally. “You’re not the only one who’s been through this rodeo, you know. I already know the drill.” Then, because she just can’t help herself, she adds, “Why? Does <em> Her Royal Highness </em> need a little help?”</p><p>It comes out meaner than she intended, but she doesn’t take it back.</p><p>Agatha looks at her, and whatever softness Rio thought she was seeing minutes ago evaporates. Or maybe it was never there, and she was just imagining it.</p><p>“No, not at all. I simply thought you might require my assistance. British media operates rather differently from American media,” she replies, straightening her posture. “But if you’re truly as well-prepared as you say, I'll let you get on with your business.”</p><p>With that, Agatha steps away from the counter, making it abundantly clear that their conversation has concluded.</p><p>Rio watches her walk toward the door, expecting her to leave without another word. But just before Agatha disappears down the hall, she pauses. Turns her head just slightly.</p><p>“You look a bit different with glasses on,” she says before turning away. </p><p>Rio stays frozen in place, spoon hovering midair, trying to figure out whether that was meant to be a dig, or a very, very subtle compliment.</p><hr /><p>The studio hums with the kind of nervous energy that only comes from live television. Producers murmuring final instructions into earpieces, stagehands shuffle around fixing lights, and someone is already holding a countdown card with “<b>3 MINUTES</b>” scrawled in thick black marker.</p><p>Rio shifts in her seat as another staff member reaches over to dust off a final bit of powder from her nose. She resists the urge to swat them away because <em> professionalism </em>, but seriously, how much powder does one person need? She probably looks like a powdered donut at this point.</p><p>Next to her, Agatha sits with the kind of stillness that makes her look like she was really sculpted rather than born. A team of stylists hovers around her, fussing over her blazer, tucking a stray strand of hair, perfecting an image that, frankly, was already too perfect. If she’s bothered by the fuss, she doesn’t show it. Years of being in the public eye might have trained her well.</p><p>Even in Rio’s peripheral vision, Agatha is a damn portrait. Effortlessly composed, annoyingly poised, and, even under the harsh studio lights, infuriatingly attractive. The kind of attractive that makes her brain stall for half a second before she slaps it back into working order.</p><p>But what really gets her, beyond the unfair way the camera seems to love Agatha, is that this isn’t the Agatha Rio spoke to last night. This Agatha is nothing like the woman who had stood barefoot in a kitchen at one in the morning, eating jelly straight from the cup.</p><p>That Agatha had almost seemed human. This one was made for television.</p><p>The host, a middle-aged woman with all that polished charm and media-trained warmth, turns to Rio first. “So, Rio, welcome back to England! How are you enjoying your time here?”</p><p>Rio, already expecting the question, flashes a practiced smile. “I’ve only been here a few times before, mostly tagging along with my mom for work engagements, but this is definitely the longest I’ve stayed in one go. Still, you know, it’s always <em> charming </em> being here.” She emphasizes the word just enough to make Agatha glance at her, probably wondering if it’s sarcasm. It is. </p><p>The host nods, “And how are you finding it this time around? Would you say England still holds the same charm for you?”</p><p>Rio exhales a short laugh. “Well, honestly, it’s a bit different when your visit starts with an international headline.”</p><p>The host chuckles along with her, turning now to Agatha. “Speaking of which, we must discuss the rather memorable incident at the royal wedding last week. I think everyone watching has seen the pictures by now. Would the two of you care to set the record straight? What exactly happened?”</p><p>Agatha, ever composed, offers a measured response. “It was, in truth, an unfortunate accident. One that has, regrettably, been greatly sensationalized beyond necessity. Of course, we regret any inconvenience it may have caused, but truly, it was nothing more than an innocent mishap.”</p><p>“Agatha’s right,” Rio says, and maybe it’s her imagination, but Agatha seems the tiniest bit thrown off by hearing her own name from Rio’s mouth. “It really was an accident, just one that happened to be blown up to royal proportions. And yes, pun absolutely intended.”</p><p>The host and audience laugh, and even the crew chuckles off-camera. Rio is mildly surprised that it actually landed, guess British dry humor isn’t so different after all. </p><p>“Pretty much, my foot got caught in my dress, I lost my balance, and like any normal, panicked person, I grabbed the closest thing to keep myself from falling.” Rio shoots a glance at Agatha. “Unfortunately for both of us, that happened to be Her Royal Highness. She was just trying to help, but instead, we both went crashing right along with the cake.”</p><p>“A seven-tier cake, no less,” the host chimes in. “That must have been quite the moment.”</p><p>Agatha, who has been listening patiently, finally speaks. “It was indeed unexpected,” she says, “but as some may know, incidents like this are not entirely uncommon within the Palace. Accidents happen, but it certainly made for a rather memorable evening.”</p><p>“That it certainly did, Your Highness.” The host smiles, before transitioning. “Now, I have to say, the two of you seem to share a rather fascinating dynamic. Naturally, people are quite curious about your friendship. How did it all begin? When did the two of you first cross paths?”</p><p>Rio slightly hesitates before responding, “We’ve actually been in contact for quite some time.”</p><p>It’s a lie, of course. But Agatha doesn’t so much as blink. She simply nods, picking up where Rio leaves off. “Yes, we’ve corresponded on and off. So when we finally met in person, it wasn’t entirely unfamiliar.”</p><p>Rio watches her, not sure whether to be impressed or something else. Not a single pause, not even a hint of doubt. If she didn’t know the truth, she might’ve actually believed it herself. Agatha was dangerously good at lying.</p><hr /><p>Hyde Park is a dream this time of year. Golden leaves crunching underfoot, and the warm smell of roasted chestnuts from a nearby vendor. It would be almost peaceful if not for the huddle of paparazzi near the entrance, cameras ready, just waiting for their golden shot.</p><p>Rio tugs at the sleeves of her navy sweater, rolling them up to her elbows as she side-eyes Agatha, who, of course, looks as impeccably put-together in a fitted cream turtleneck tucked into tailored trousers. A stark contrast to Rio’s more laid-back sneakers-and-jeans approach.</p><p>“This is ridiculous,” Rio mutters, jamming her hands into her pockets.</p><p>“Obviously,” Agatha replies smoothly, walking half a step ahead. “But optics matter. You, of all people, should know that by now, since you’ve made it very clear this isn’t your first rodeo.”</p><p>A few meters away, their security detail hovers at a discreet distance, blending into the afternoon crowd, while the conveniently tipped-off paparazzi lurk near the park gates. </p><p>“I still don’t see why this is necessary,” Rio grumbles, kicking a loose pebble down the path.</p><p>“You got irresponsibly drunk, tripped at my brother’s wedding, took me down with you, and destroyed an incomprehensibly expensive cake. That’s why,” Agatha reminds her. “That, plus the rumors, plus the fact that you looked seconds away from strangling me on live television –”</p><p>“I did not.” </p><p>“– which, naturally, makes everyone think we indeed hate each other.” She finally looks over at Rio. “Do I need to go over the details again?”</p><p>Rio exhales, tilting her head back to look at the sky. </p><p>“First of all, you practically shoved me into that sixty-five thousand-pound cake, which, by the way, shouldn’t even cost that much. Honestly, that money could’ve gone toward more important things in this so-called perfect country of yours. And this whole mess isn’t just my fault, Princess. We both know you’re just as much to blame as I am.”</p><p>Agatha is about to snap back when she notices the paparazzi getting a little too eager, their cameras practically zooming in on the tension between her and Rio. With an exasperated sigh, she comes to a halt, waiting just long enough for Rio to catch up before casually looping her arm through Rio’s elbow. </p><p>Rio immediately tenses. “What the hell are you doing?” she mutters, barely moving her lips.</p><p>“As much as I’d love to continue this utterly pointless argument,” Agatha says, “I’d rather not be the subject of another equally pointless headline.” She tilts her head slightly, as if addressing Rio but really angling herself just enough to present a polished, unbothered image for the cameras. “Especially when there are far more important things happening in the world.”</p><p>Rio scoffs, “Oh, look at you. Suddenly a humanitarian.”</p><p>“I’ve always cared about global issues,” Agatha deadpans.</p><p>Nearby, a couple of little girls glance in their direction, and Agatha offers them a small smile. Rio notices, and can’t help but think that Agatha is going to look annoyingly good in these carefully curated paparazzi shots. “Right. Funny how I’ve never actually heard you talk about any of these ‘important things’ in public.”</p><p>For the briefest second, Agatha’s grip on Rio’s arm tightens, a barely-there reaction, before she forces herself to relax, like she hadn’t meant to show any emotion at all. “Because I’m not allowed to,” she says. There’s a thread of something beneath it. Frustration, maybe. “There are strict rules. Protocols.” She adds, like she’s had to explain it a thousand times before. “Unlike you, I don’t just get to say whatever I want.”</p><p>“That’s bullshit.” </p><p>Agatha shoots Rio a look. One of those rare, raw looks Rio has only seen twice now. The first time was right before the cake catastrophe. “Again, as much as I adore your refreshing honesty and that blunt American charm, you might want to watch your mouth when you talk to me.”</p><p>Rio, clearly intrigued and entertained by these rare flashes of Agatha’s fire, says nothing for a moment. Instead, she mutters, “Sounds miserable.” It’s more to herself than to anyone else, but it’s loud enough to be heard.</p><p>“What?” Agatha turns her head slightly, catching the words. </p><p>Rio shrugs. “Never getting to say what you actually think.”</p><p>“Well…” Agatha hesitates, her lips pressing together before she quickly schools her expression again. “You get used to it.”</p><hr /><p>One of the reasons Rio doesn’t see herself as a miserable president’s daughter is that she knows the privilege she holds can make a real difference. While many of the presidential kids before her chose to step away from politics, opting for a quieter, normal life, Rio leans into it. She embraces it fully because, at her core, she genuinely cares about almost everything.</p><p>She’s got this tendency to care too damn much about things that most people either ignore or don’t think twice about. Like how so many people are struggling to make ends meet while wages stay low, or how some can’t afford healthcare and have to pick between getting medicine or paying rent. It bothers her when people ignore the effects of climate change or how certain jobs don’t pay fairly. She hates how inequality is still a thing, whether it’s race, gender, or mental health. </p><p>And right now, standing on the steps of St. Helena’s Children’s Center, Rio can’t help but wonder if the kids here have enough books and toys. Not just any books and toys, but the kind that let them escape their hospital beds and forget about the fight they’re in.</p><p>Rio, Agatha, and their entourage of security have pretty much taken over the floor, leaving the doctors and nurses scrambling, shaking hands with anyone who gets too close. </p><p>Rio’s trying her best not to roll her eyes at the whole spectacle, but it’s hard when Agatha’s flashing that flawless, almost fake smile as she poses for a photo with a little girl hooked up to so many tubes. The whole thing feels staged, and after Agatha’s speech in the park about caring, Rio wonders if she just said all that to shut her up.</p><p>She wants to scream at the hypocrisy, at this whole ridiculous country and its monarchy, but she's legally bound to be here, so she forces herself to focus on the kids instead.</p><p>Most of the kids don’t have a clue who she is, but Agatha introduces her as the president’s daughter, and suddenly, Rio’s bombarded with questions: Does she live in the White House? Is it true that the White House has more ghosts than Buckingham Palace? Do they have a secret tunnel to Disney World? Is it true that American presidents have to wear capes when they’re in office? Does she personally know Captain America? And, of course, can she get Taylor Swift to perform at her birthday party?</p><p>Rio laughs and plays along, letting them bask in the excitement of it all.</p><p>She then helps Agatha unpack the boxes of books and toys, watching as the princess climbs onto hospital beds, reading aloud while a photographer hovers nearby, angling for the perfect shot. It all feels so rehearsed, and Rio can’t stand it. She’s about two seconds away from throwing herself off the nearest bridge – London Bridge, preferably, just to break the monotony of this shit show.</p><p>Luckily, a group of kids grabs her hand and pulls her into a tea party, where she’s handed a tiny plastic cup and crowned with a crooked paper tiara. At some point, she loses track of Agatha and the ever-present media hovering around them. It’s the first time she’s smiled all day. But all too soon, the kids are called away for their checkups.</p><p>Left on her own, Rio takes the opportunity to wander. She drifts toward the quieter corners of the children’s center, where the cameras don’t reach. That’s when she hears voices coming from a room just down the hall.</p><p>“What’s your name?” A familiar voice drifts through the door.</p><p>Rio hesitates for half a second before curiosity gets the better of her, and she peeks around the corner. She sees Agatha sitting beside a little boy’s bed, his small hands busily threading colorful beads into a bracelet.</p><p>“Nicholas,” he says without looking up. “But my friends call me Nicky.”</p><p>Agatha smiles, and for once, it’s not the polished, camera-ready kind. It’s softer, more genuine. “Nicky, huh? I’ve always liked that name. Thought about using it if I ever had a kid one day.”</p><p>The boy pauses mid-thread, glancing up at her. “Really?”</p><p>“Really,” Agatha nods. She picks up one of the finished bracelets from his table, turning it over in her fingers. “So, what do we have here?”</p><p>“Friendship bracelets,” Nicky explains, continuing his work. “I’m making one for each of my mates to give them when I finally get out of here. Nurse Lily taught me how.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile softens further. She doesn’t glance at the tubes or the way his breathing sounds just a little too labored. She just looks at him like any other kid. And Rio, still standing quietly by the door, can’t take her eyes off them.</p><p>“Can I have one too?” Agatha asks.</p><p>Nicky pauses, brows furrowing. “I don’t know if princesses should wear friendship bracelets.”</p><p>“And what makes you say that?”</p><p>“Well,” He shrugs. “Don’t princesses only wear gold, crystals, and diamonds? That’s what I usually see in movies.” </p><p>Agatha lifts her wrist and wiggles her fingers. “Do you see me wearing any of that now?”</p><p>Nicky eyes her before shaking his head. “No.”</p><p>“Then would you make an exception for me?” she asks, her lips pulling into a playful pout.</p><p>Rio has never seen Agatha pout before. It’s a little ridiculous. It’s also kind of adorable.</p><p>Nicky shrugs again, “I'll think about it.”</p><p>Agatha beams. “I promise I won’t let Señor Scratchy get a hold of it.”</p><p>The boy blinks. “Who’s Señor Scratchy?”</p><p>“My rabbit.”</p><p>“You have a rabbit?”</p><p>“Yes. I do have one. I would’ve brought him here today, but that little guy is a bit of a menace. He may or may not swallow all of these beads if given the chance.”</p><p>Nicky giggles. “I always wanted a pet rabbit. But my mum says I’m too young.”</p><p>“Well, she’s got a point,” Agatha says, tilting her head. “But if you’d like, I could talk to Señor Scratchy about not eating some of these beads, and maybe I can bring him to visit.”</p><p>Nicky’s eyes widen. “You’d do that?”</p><p>“Of course. I’m sure he’d love to hop around here for a bit.”</p><p>The boy grins, clearly pleased. “In that case, I’ll make you a bracelet.”</p><p>Agatha gasps, placing a hand on her chest. </p><p>“Really? But I thought princesses weren’t allowed to wear them?”</p><p>“Well, you have a rabbit, so I guess you’re not like other princesses,” he says matter-of-factly. “I’ll make you one and give it to you when you bring Señor Scratchy.”</p><p>Agatha reaches for a bracelet sitting nearby. “Why can’t I have this one?”</p><p>Nicky softly swats her hand away. “Hey!” Agatha yelps, feigning pain as she cradles her fingers. “Now that’s not very nice, Mister.”</p><p>“Well, it’s not nice to take things that aren’t yours, Princess,” Nicky says, folding his arms.</p><p>From her spot by the door, Rio bites the inside of her cheek to stop herself from laughing.</p><p>“This one’s for my mate Daisy,” Nicky says, holding up an orange bracelet with a little flower in the middle. “It’s her favorite color. I’ll make yours after I finish all my friends’ first.”</p><p>Agatha nods solemnly, as if he’s just given her a royal decree. “Okay. Sounds like a fair trade.”</p><p>“Alright, Nicky, time for your check-up,” a nurse says, stepping in from the other entrance with a clipboard in hand. Agatha jumps a little, and Rio quickly straightens up from where she’d been leaning against the doorframe.</p><p>Nicky groans, slumping dramatically against his pillows. “Do I have to?”</p><p>“I’m afraid so, sweetheart,” the nurse chuckles, walking over to his bedside. </p><p>Agatha pushes herself up, but as she lifts her head, her eyes land on Rio. The president's daughter stiffens instinctively, quickly clearing her throat. The princess, for her part, snaps back into composed form almost instantly, as if she hadn’t just been pouting at an eight-year-old over a friendship bracelet.</p><p>Nicky pouts as Agatha stands. “You know, Agatha can stay.”</p><p>The nurse, adjusting Nicky’s IV drip, looks mildly alarmed and quickly corrects him. “Nicky, sweetheart, that’s not the proper way to address the Princess.” She then turns to Agatha with an apologetic smile. “I’m so sorry, Your Highness.”</p><p>But Agatha waves it off before the nurse can even finish. “It’s fine,” she says. Then, turning back to Nicky, she adds, “I’d love to stay, but I also have to go. I’ll be back next time, though.”</p><p>Nicky perks up. “And Señor Scratchy too, right?”</p><p>Agatha chuckles, this time more composed. “Of course. I’ll have a quick word with him, see if I can convince him. And I’ll be expecting that bracelet too,” she says with a wink before stepping out of the room, brushing past Rio.</p><p>“I read about him in your fact sheet, but what exactly does Señor Scratchy look like?” Rio asks, falling into step beside Agatha as they walk down the hospital hallway. “Does he have a tiny crown? Maybe a little throne to match?”</p><p>Agatha barely spares her a glance. “Didn’t realize Americans were such terrible eavesdroppers.”</p><p>“It wasn’t on purpose,” Rio counters, easily keeping pace. She’s about to tease Agatha further when a sudden shout rings out from the opposite hall, followed by a loud pop that sounds far too much like a gunshot.</p><p>Before Rio can even process it, Alice is there, gripping her and Agatha by the arms and shoving them both through the nearest door. “Stay down,” she orders, and slams it shut behind them.</p><p>The fall is a disaster from the second Rio’s foot snags on the mop handle. There’s a brief, panicked moment where she flails, grasping at nothing, before she goes tumbling straight into a pile of forgotten cleaning supplies. She barely has time to groan before Agatha crashes down on top of her, knocking the wind from her lungs. </p><p>All Rio can hear is the rapid thump of her heartbeat and the slow, measured inhale of Agatha’s breath against her skin. “Shit,” Rio grumbles, spitting out a strand of Agatha’s hair. “You know,” she adds, her words practically vibrating against the other woman’s shoulder, “we really need to stop ending up like this.”</p><p>“Would you mind? I’m trying to get off,” Agatha huffs, attempting to roll off her, only for Rio’s knee to press somewhere it absolutely shouldn’t. Rio freezes. Agatha does too. </p><p>A tense beat passes, and then Rio hisses, “This is definitely on you.”</p><p>“Oh, excuse me, but how exactly is this my fault?” Agatha whisper-yells, trying to maneuver away, but the cramped space and the heap of supplies make it impossible.</p><p>“I’ve done plenty of public appearances as the president’s daughter, and not once has anyone ever tried to take me out.” Rio tilts her head, her face just inches from Agatha’s. “Whether you want to admit it or not, a lot of people hate the monarchy. You really think it’s a coincidence that the second I stand next to you, we’re suddenly dodging bullets?”</p><p>“For the love of God, can you stop talking before you get us both killed?” Agatha snaps, only to stop midway when she catches Rio sniffing her. “Are you – are you seriously smelling me right now? What is wrong with you?” </p><p>Rio scoffs. “Oh, please. You’re practically shoving your scent into my nose.” She pauses, then wrinkles her nose dramatically. “And what kind of person still wears lavender? What are you, a Victorian widow? Did you raid your grandma’s perfume stash or something?” </p><p>Agatha breathes, clearly trying to rein in whatever royal decorum she has left. “It’s French lavender, if you must know. A classic, elegant scent. Not that I expect someone with drugstore body spray habits to understand.” </p><p>Rio gasps, “Excuse you, Princess, but this is top-tier American deodorant.” </p><p>Agatha mutters something under her breath, probably something unfit for a royal, before shifting, trying once again to untangle herself from their ridiculous predicament. </p><p>“Just move your leg, will you? This is getting really uncomfortable.”</p><p>“You move your leg. And for the record, I’m very uncomfortable too. Not to mention, you’ve got all your weight on me, so you don’t get to complain.” Rio shifts, only to get a mouthful of Agatha’s hair. She spits it out with a dramatic gag. “I swear, Your Highness, if you don’t get off me in the next three seconds, I will make this your problem.”</p><p>“As much as I’d love to, my foot is stuck in a bucket, and I can hardly see a thing.”</p><p>Rio groans, trying once more to wiggle free, only to end up pressing against Agatha even more. Agatha scowls again. “Would you please stop grinding against me? I can literally feel your cunt rubbing against mine right now.”</p><p>Rio freezes, scandalized. “I’m certainly not grinding–” Her face burns as she thrashes even harder, desperately trying to shake Agatha off. “That is absolutely not what’s happening here!” </p><p>“Whatever.” Agatha nostrils flares. “Just help me get this bucket off.”</p><p>Rio shifts again, but all it does is make their situation worse. With an exasperated sigh, she resorts to using her own foot to pry at the bucket trapping Agatha’s. She pushes the bucket, maybe a little harder than necessary, making Agatha yelp. “Ow! Gentle, please!”</p><p>Rio breathes. “I just really hope there aren’t any kids outside this door hearing all this.” With one final tug, the bucket finally pops off. “There. Crisis over, Princess. You can get off me now.”</p><p>Agatha rolls onto her side with an exhausted sigh. “Finally.” </p><p>Rio barely sits up, shaking her head. “You’re welcome, by the way.”</p><p>Agatha scoffs. “Oh, yes, thank you so much for nearly dislocating my foot.” She shifts onto her side, deliberately avoiding Rio’s gaze. “And just so you know, no one has ever dared make an attempt on my life before either. So sue me if I refuse to take the blame for this.” </p><p>She sounds like she wants to strangle Rio real bad, which, frankly the most likable she’s ever been, in Rio’s opinion. “Careful, Princess. Your tiara’s about to slip.”</p><p>Agatha whirls around in their cramped space, and swats at her, but Rio shifts her hips at the last second. “Would you quit talking and squirming? Or is tempting death just a hobby of yours?” </p><p>Rio smirks. “Look at you, all worried about me. Warms my heart, really.”</p><p>Agatha sighs. “Unbelievable. Even in a freaking crisis, you find time to be insufferable. You might actually be more dangerous to my sanity than whatever’s happening outside.”</p><p>For the first time today, Rio starts thinking maybe Agatha isn’t just some fragile, holier-than-thou royal like she’d assumed. She keeps catching these little glimpses of something else. She’s smart, stubborn, and if Rio really stretches her imagination, maybe even a little fun. And it’s honestly throwing her off balance.</p><p>Rio always prided herself on reading people, knowing exactly what buttons to push to get them talking, when to press and when to pull back. It’s how she operates. But somehow, this tightly wound princess is messing with her usual instincts, tilting the board just enough to make Rio second-guess the game. Not that she minds a challenge.</p><p>She lets the silence sit for a moment, listening to the shuffle of feet outside. Then, in the most laid-back voice she can manage, she says, “So. A pet rabbit, huh?” She tries to sound casual, but old habits win, and it still comes out vaguely mocking.</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. “Yes, Rio, believe it or not, royal children don’t spend their entire childhood posing for portraits. We’re allowed to have pets.”</p><p>Rio squints at her. “Yeah, I don’t know about that. Kinda hard to picture you as anything other than a kid raised on tea parties, curtsy lessons, and…I don’t know, daily training on how to look down on common folk?”</p><p>Agatha levels her with a look so dry it could evaporate a lake. “Oh, absolutely. That’s exactly how my childhood went. Every morning, I woke up at dawn to practice looking unimpressed in a hundred different ways. By noon, I was presented with a selection of teacups to judge as acceptable or horrifically offensive to my noble sensibilities. And by evening, I was forced to duel other members of court in a battle of perfect etiquette. Winner gets an extra crumpet.”</p><p>Rio snorts. “And how many crumpets did you win?”</p><p>Agatha punches her again. “Can you not?”</p><p>Rio laughs. She wasn’t expecting a sarcastic answer, much less a funny one. Something about it makes her stare at Agatha’s direction a little too long. A princess who throws punches. A princess who, apparently, has a sense of humor buried underneath. A princess who has a pet rabbit with a Spanish name, of all things.</p><p>“You’re really messing with my idea of you, you know that?” Rio says, tilting her head.</p><p>Agatha gives her a look. “And what exactly is that idea?”</p><p>“Someone who’s trying way too hard to be something she’s not.”</p><p>For the briefest second, something surfaces across Agatha’s face. Then her expression smooths out quickly. She looks away. “I have no idea what you’re talking about. And even if I did, it wouldn’t be any of your business.”</p><p>Rio huffs another laugh. “Yeah, see, that’s where you’re wrong. Because, unfortunately for you, this is my business now. Because we’re legally required to be the best of friends. As much as I want this weekend to end, this is not the end of...whatever this is. Once we leave, once we go back to our own lives, people will still be watching. If we magically stop talking, disappear from each other’s orbit, never interact again, everyone’s gonna smell the bullshit from a mile away.”</p><p>Agatha stays silent, still refusing to look at her. Rio continues. “Look, if I’m stuck in this ridiculous arrangement with you, the least you can do is give me a heads-up on whatever’s lurking beneath all that royal composure, before it blindsides me and screws me over.”</p><p>Agatha finally rolls over, her face inches from Rio’s, and for a second, Rio feels her heart drop. They’re so close she can practically smell the peppermint toothpaste on Agatha’s breath.</p><p>“Alright then. For starters, would you care to explain in detail why you seem to hate me so much? I mean, what did I ever do to you?” </p><p>Rio slightly leans back, putting some distance between them. </p><p>“I don’t think you want to go down that road.”</p><p>“And what if I do?” </p><p>Rio thinks about it, about finally telling Agatha exactly why she hates her. She opens her mouth, but then closes it. She tries again, but before she can speak, the door suddenly swings open.</p><p>“All clear, ladies. False alarm,” Alice says as she reappears in front of them. “Apparently, a few kids thought it’d be a great idea to break out the party poppers for their buddy.” She looks down at them, sprawled on the floor, eyes blinking and adjusting to the glaring fluorescent lights. “Well, this looks seemingly comfy.”</p><p>“Tell me about it,” Rio deadpans. She immediately holds her hand out for Alice to pull her up. Agatha, still sitting on the floor, looks up at Rio, who offers her hand next. “If it’s still not clear, this is me offering an official truce, Princess,” she adds.</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes but takes Rio’s hand. “I believe this conversation isn’t over yet.” </p><p>Rio locks eyes with her, her hand still in the other woman’s grip. For a second, everything around them fades. She notices something about Agatha’s eyes that she hadn’t before. In the bright fluorescent light, her striking blue eyes have a sort of golden hue mixed in. It’s the kind of thing you wouldn’t notice unless you were really looking.</p><p>The moment stretches a bit too long, and just when it feels like it might get awkward, the rest of the royal security and Billy rush in. Rio pulls her hand away.</p><p>“I guess I’ll see you at the state dinner, Your Highness,” she says, giving Agatha one last glance before turning to follow Alice, leaving Agatha with her team.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Rio sprawls across the couch in her neatly kept, plant-filled apartment, aggressively jamming buttons on her controller as <em> Super Mario </em> dashes across her big-ass TV screen, grabbing coins and dodging grumpy turtles. Across the room, Alice leans against the couch, scrolling through her phone as she reads the latest headlines and articles about Rio’s recent trip to England.</p><p>
  <em> “Both have captured public attention after Vidal’s recent London visit. The Princess and the President’s Daughter were seen strolling through Hyde Park and visiting a children's center, with clips of their candid interactions quickly going viral. British tabloids and U.S. media outlets alike have been quick to analyze their dynamic. While they’ve publicly claimed to be friends, some speculate that underlying tensions still remain. Others suggest their appearances together are merely a strategic diplomatic move or an attempt at damage control following the events at the recent royal wedding. Whether their connection extends beyond official duties remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the public is watching closely.” </em>
</p><p>Rio is only half-listening to whatever Alice just said, too busy outmaneuvering angry mushrooms on her way to rescue Princess Peach. Alice gives her a look. “Clearly, the internet’s having a field day with you and Her Royal Highness. As expected, you two are everywhere. Clips from the interview, photos from Hyde Park, the hospital visit. People are really eating this shit up.” She stretches before standing up. “Sure, there are still some skeptics, but Lilia’s team said you actually pulled it off pretty damn well. Now you just gotta keep up the act.”</p><p>Rio, still glued to her game, catches Alice heading for the door. “Wait, you’re ditching me already?” She adjusts her glasses, finally pausing the game to grab the half-finished beer beside her. “The pizza’s not even here yet. And I ordered four, by the way. Kinda figured you’d be staying.”</p><p>Alice snorts, slipping her arms into her coat. “I would, but some of us still have actual jobs to do. Agent Hill’s been breathing down my neck ever since your little stunt at the royal wedding.” She checks her phone and lets out a sigh. “I’ve got three briefings stacked up, and sadly, none of them involve video games and takeout.” </p><p>Rio scoffs, pushing herself up from the floor. “Since when do you bail on me on Saturdays? This is completely out of character, Agent Gulliver. I’m taking this straight to the President.”</p><p>Alice just rolls her eyes, already pulling the door open. “Herb and the boys are outside if you need anything, or you know, help you deal with the ridiculous amount of pizza you ordered. Just do me a favor and try not to make headlines again while I’m gone.”</p><p>Rio smirks, leaning back into the couch as she resumes her game. </p><p>“Come on, you know me. I’ve always been on my best behavior.”</p><p>Alice sighs, already looking like she regrets ever deciding to leave. “Not when there’s booze involved. Try not to go overboard, or I swear I’ll have every last beer in your fridge confiscated.” She steps out, grumbling under her breath about the never-ending struggle of babysitting a fully grown toddler, just as the door clicks shut behind her.</p><p>Rio exhales sharply, tossing the controller onto the couch before reaching for her phone. </p><p>She scrolls through the latest headlines and endless photos of herself and Agatha. The comments range from genuine admiration to downright unhinged thoughts. Some people are calling them an iconic duo with ‘lethal face cards,’ others are gushing over their so-called friendship goals, and in the far corners of Rio’s algorithm, they’re even being shipped as a romantic couple. She nearly chokes on her own spit when she sees a comment that straight-up says, <b> <em>"they should just tongue it out already and end world hunger.” </em> </b></p><p>Absolutely not. Not in this lifetime.</p><p>But what really grabs Rio’s attention isn’t another wild take. But a photo of Agatha.</p><p>A soft smile on her face, eyes crinkling just slightly. Probably taken when she was smiling at those little girls at the park. She looks so unguarded in this particular shot. So different from the stiff, poised princess she first met. </p><p>Rio stares at it a second too long. “Must be exhausting being this insufferable,” she says before locking her phone, and flopping back onto the couch. And as if on cue, Herb’s voice rings out from the other side of the door.</p><hr /><p>Rio manages to sidestep a group of wide-eyed freshmen practically snapping their necks to get a better look at her and makes her way toward the west side of campus. She’s well aware that some people still get starstruck when they see her, and most days she humors them, but not when she’s already running late for class. She finishes off the last watered-down sip of her <em> iced brown sugar oat milk shaken espresso </em> and keeps walking, passing students sprawled across the grass or perched on benches. </p><p>Taking classes at Georgetown feels way different from her last year of med school, the same year her mom took office and security had been quite overwhelming. Back then, men in literal black suits followed her everywhere. </p><p>But now, things are more relaxed. No constant entourage, and no motorcade blocking the campus roads. She actually almost feels like a regular student. Well, except for the Secret Service agents probably lurking in disguise. But she’s gotten used to ignoring them.</p><p>Her first class of the day is an elective she picked out of intellectual interest and a need to understand how the natural order of things falls apart, and more importantly, how people scramble to fix it. Today’s topic covers the biggest political scandals to ever rock the White House. Less about the drama (though Rio wouldn’t complain if there was more) and more about how leaders try (and usually fail) to clean up the mess.</p><p>The lecture kicks off with scandals so infamous they’re basically part of American history at this point. From JFK and Marilyn Monroe’s rumored affair to Eisenhower and Summersby, to Nixon’s weird obsession with ketchup. Half the room is hooked on the drama, while the other half pretends they’re too cool to care.</p><p>Rio wonders what it’s like to have one’s life brutally dissected like this. Then again, with the internet picking apart everything she does, especially her recent run-ins with the Princess of fucking Britannia, maybe she already knows. Maybe she’s already living it.</p><p>They were knee-deep in yet another White House scandal when Rio’s phone buzzed with a chime she hadn’t heard in a while. It’s distinct from her usual notifications. She unlocks her screen and opens the anonymous messaging app she uses with a select few. A new message pops up on her screen, from a user – <b>Arthur Hardass</b>.</p><p>Rio’s brows furrow as she reads the text. </p><p><b> <em>Arthur Hardass: </em> </b> <em> “If nothing else, I have to admire your confidence, stepping outside looking like this. Though, I suppose when you're the First Daughter, no one dares to say it to your face.” </em></p><p>There’s a photo attached. A paparazzi shot of Rio jogging at Lafayette. And yeah, she looks a little rough, wearing her oversized Georgetown hoodie, baggy sweatpants, and mismatched green and black socks sticking out of her sneakers. She looks more like a sleep-deprived college student than the First Daughter of the United States.</p><p><b> <em>Arthur Hardass:</em> </b> <em> “It’s Agatha, in case you were wondering. Thought it’d be simpler for us to talk like this, without all the middlemen.” </em></p><p>Rio rolls her eyes, her fingers hovering over the screen as she debates whether to respond. In the end, she puts her phone face down on the desk and tunes back into the lecture. But later, at dinner, she eventually gives in and texts back.</p><p><b> <em>Ralph Vines: </em> </b> <em> “How did you get my number on here? And seriously, what’s with the name?” </em></p><p>It’s the afternoon after when Rio finally gets a reply.</p><p><b> <em>Arthur Hardass: </em> </b> <em> “Let’s just say I have my ways. And I may or may not have blackmailed some into giving it to me. Also, don’t even start on the name. Yours is honestly, pretty boring to say the least. Blame Señor Scratchy on mine though. He insisted on it.” </em></p><p><b> <em>Ralph Vines: </em> </b> <em> “Do you always blame the bunny for all your questionable decisions?” </em></p><p><b> <em>Arthur Hardass: </em> </b> <em> “Scratchy takes full responsibility for my actions. He’s a terrible influence.”  </em></p><p><b> <em>Ralph Vines:</em> </b> <em> “Right. Because the rabbit is the problem here.” </em></p><p>Three days later, as Rio tosses her phone onto the bed, the screen lights up.  </p><p><b> <em>Arthur Hardass: </em> </b> <em> “You have a habit of posting cryptic song lyrics with absolutely no context.”   </em></p><p>Rio glances at the clock. Midnight in Britain.  </p><p><b> <em>Ralph Vines: </em> </b> <em> “And you certainly enjoy stalking me in the dead of night.” </em></p><p><b> <em>Arthur Hardass:</em> </b> <em> “I wouldn’t call it stalking. It’s just important to stay informed.” </em></p><p><b> <em>Ralph Vines:</em> </b> <em> “Oh? And why exactly do you need to stay informed?” </em></p><p>Rio waits, and watches the little ‘typing’ bubble appear for a second. Then disappear.</p><p>Five days pass before Agatha finally decides to grace Rio with a reply.</p><p><b> <em>Arthur Hardass:</em> </b> <em> “Your speech about healthcare reform was almost impressive. Almost.” </em></p><p><b> <em>Ralph Vines:</em> </b> <em> “At this point, just say ‘hi’ like a normal person.” </em></p><p><b> <em>Arthur Hardass:</em> </b> <em> “You should be grateful. I don’t usually waste my time on American politics.” </em></p><p><b> <em>Ralph Vines:</em> </b> <em> “Oh wow, Princess. I’m so touched. Really feeling the support.” </em></p><p><b> <em>Arthur Hardass:</em> </b> <em> “As you should. I sacrificed three whole minutes of my morning for this.” </em></p><p><b> <em>Ralph Vines:</em> </b> <em> “Next time, I’ll throw in some cartoons to really keep you engaged.” </em></p><p>The next day, while struggling through an essay on the impact of diplomatic immunity on international crime, Rio’s phone buzzes against the table.</p><p><b> <em>Arthur Hardass:</em> </b> <em> “I need your opinion.” </em></p><p><b> <em>Ralph Vines:</em> </b> <em> “That’s new. Should I be honored or concerned?” </em></p><p><b> <em>Arthur Hardass:</em> </b> <em> “I was just asked to pick a charity initiative to personally oversee this year. I’m torn between launching a new sustainable housing project or funding the restoration of some old royal estates.” </em></p><p><b> <em>Ralph Vines:</em> </b> <em> “Oh, you’re actually asking me something serious.” </em></p><p><b> <em>Arthur Hardass:</em> </b> <em> “Don’t make me regret it.” </em></p><p><b> <em>Ralph Vines:</em> </b> <em> “Housing, obviously. The world’s going to shit, and more people need somewhere to live. Pretty sure your palaces can survive without another round of gold plating.” </em></p><p>Agatha doesn’t reply. No thanks for the input, Rio. No duly noted, Vidal. Just radio silence. Typical ungrateful royal brat.</p><p>But a few days later, while absentmindedly scrolling, Rio stumbles across an article: <b>Princess Agatha Harkness Announces New Housing Initiative. </b>She stares at the headline for a second, then snorts. Alright. Not so ungrateful after all.</p><p>And just as she’s about to close the tab, her phone buzzes with a new text.</p><p><b> <em>Arthur Hardass: </em> </b> <em> “Do you ever actually look in a mirror before going outside?” </em></p><p><b> <em>Ralph Vines: </em> </b> <em> “What is it this time?” </em></p><p>Before she can even wrap her head around it, her phone buzzes again, this time with a picture. She nearly chokes on her coffee, almost spilling it all over her open books. It’s her, walking out of the Georgetown Library: messy bun hanging on for dear life, hoodie sliding off one shoulder, looking absolutely done with everything.</p><p><b> <em>Ralph Vines:</em> </b> <em> “What the hell! Where did you even get this?!” </em></p><p><b> <em>Arthur Hardass:</em> </b> <em> “It’s on Twitter.” </em></p><p><b> <em>Ralph Vines:</em> </b> <em> “Well, in my defense, coffee was my only meal that day. I’m fairly certain my soul peaced out somewhere around hour two.” </em></p><p><b> <em>Arthur Hardass:</em> </b> <em> “You should take better care of yourself.” </em></p><p><b> <em>Ralph Vines:</em> </b> <em> “Wow, look at you. Compassion. Should I alert the press?” </em></p><p>Agatha’s response comes two weeks later in the form of a screenshot from The Gossip Daily, showing a picture of Rio with some guy, accompanied by the headline: <b>US First Daughter and Canadian PM Getting Cozy at NYC Gala: Are We Shipping This or Nah?</b></p><p><b> <em>Arthur Hardass: </em> </b> <em> “Here’s a tip, angel. Sometimes, the key to not looking miserable is to actually try not looking miserable.” </em> Followed by another text: <em> “And if you're going to wear a dress with a neckline like that, you might as well make sure everyone gets a proper look. No point in teasing if you’re not going to deliver the goods.”  </em></p><p>Surprised and barely holding back a laugh, Rio almost chokes on her drink during a fancy dinner with her mom’s senators and cabinet members. She quickly earns a disapproving look from Lilia, who, to Rio’s embarrassment, sends her off to bed early for the night. Who the hell sends a grown woman to an early bedtime? Her mom’s chief of staff, apparently. </p><p>Through their conversations, Rio begrudgingly learns that Agatha does, in fact, have a pretty decent sense of humor. She still hates her, obviously, but credit where it’s due: she definitely manages to make Rio laugh. Another thing she learns is that the Princess likes to text when she’s stuck in the mind-numbing routines of royal life, like sitting in on meetings about royal residences and renovations, or listening to advisors drone on about new security protocols. </p><p>Ofcourse, Rio still loathes her with every fiber of her being, but there’s something strangely satisfying about their back-and-forth. Agatha challenges her in a way no one else does. So, when Rio’s buried in reading laws, policies, and international relations crap, or if she’s just stuck in a particularly bad mood, she finds herself checking for a text bubble. </p><p><b> <em>Arthur Hardass:</em> </b> <em> “I was dreadfully bored and had no choice but to watch that film you raved about last week. And I have some thoughts.” </em></p><p><b> <em>Ralph Vines:</em> </b> <em> “Let me guess. You’re about to ruin it with logic.” </em></p><p><b> <em>Arthur Hardass: </em> </b> <em> “I’m simply saying, their security infiltration was utterly ridiculous.” </em></p><p><b> <em>Ralph Vines:</em> </b> <em> “Okay, but did you or did you not enjoy watching hot women steal things?” </em></p><p><b> <em>Arthur Hardass: </em> </b> <em> “I would have if they had even the tiniest grasp of strategy. There was no proper reconnaissance, far too many unpredictable factors. Sandra Bullock strolls into the Met Gala like it’s a casual brunch. Completely unrealistic. No way that would actually work.” </em></p><p><b> <em>Ralph Vines:</em> </b> <em> “Oh my God, I had no idea you were such a nerd.” </em></p><p><b> <em>Arthur Hardass:</em> </b> <em> “And you have no critical thinking skills.” </em></p><p><b> <em>Ralph Vines:</em> </b> <em> “Babe, I was too busy drooling over Cate in a suit to care about logistics.” </em></p><p>Fuck. Did Rio just call the actual princess of freaking England <b>babe</b>? Yeah, she calls her friends that all the time, but the thing is, Agatha isn’t even her friend. Not even close. But whatever. Semantics. It’s just a word. No big fucking deal.</p><p>Predictably, Agatha didn’t reply. Rio’s message was met with cold, royal silence. She stared at her phone for a second, debating whether to double-text. Then she remembered she had dignity, or at least the illusion of it, and locked her phone instead.</p><p>The next few weeks blurred by, with Rio knee-deep in paperwork at the nurses’ station, occasionally drowning in charts that made zero sense. She flipped through one particularly frustrating file where someone had scribbled <em> ‘adjusted per doc’s orders’ </em> – without mentioning which doctor or what adjustment – and was two seconds away from hunting them down when her phone buzzed on the counter.</p><p>At first, she ignored it, assuming it was another update about her schedule or Alice reminding her to actually eat. But then she saw the name on the screen.</p><p><b> <em>Arthur Hardass: </em> </b> <em> “William already gave me my itinerary. It appears I’m to endure an afternoon of American baseball, accompanied by what I assume are those rather unfortunate-looking sausages in buns. Can’t say I’m thrilled.” </em></p><p><b> <em>Ralph Vines: </em> </b> <em> “An itinerary for what, exactly?” </em></p><p>Sixteen hours, seven cups of coffee, and way too much overthinking later, a reply finally pops up in her inbox.</p><hr /><p>Still in her scrubs, Rio swings open the door to Lilia’s office without so much as a knock. The older woman is hunched over a mountain of paperwork, glasses sliding down her nose as she scrawls notes into an overstuffed briefing folder. She barely acknowledges Rio’s entrance, too caught up in whatever mess she’s dealing with. </p><p>After getting a text from Agatha saying she wasn’t just coming to DC but staying for three whole days, her first instinct was to storm straight to the one person most likely responsible for this. </p><p>“You gotta be kidding me, right? I thought she was just here for one fancy dinner, not a whole extended stay,” Rio gripes, glancing at the muted news channel in the background.</p><p>The screen shows footage of her mother’s political opponent standing behind a podium. The chyron at the bottom reads: <b>SENATOR GRANT SLAMS RURAL HOSPITAL CLOSURES, CALLS HEALTHCARE SYSTEM ‘A NATIONAL DISGRACE’</b></p><p>Lilia, still making notes on her briefing memo, replies, “As of this morning, we’ve acknowledged Her Royal Highness’s request to extend her visit.” She then finally sets her pen down and meets Rio’s gaze. “Your mother’s already been informed, and she’s on board with it.”</p><p>“You mean Agatha personally asked for this? Why the hell would she do that?” Rio’s brows pull together. “And seriously, not one person thought, ‘Hey, maybe we should give Rio a heads-up’?”</p><p>“Well, you’re hearing it now,” Lilia says, closing a folder and setting it aside. “The Princess will be staying at Blair House, and you, naturally, will be accompanying her to every event while she’s here.” She picks up her phone, taps it a few times, then gestures toward Rio’s pocket. “I just sent you her entire itinerary. Read it. And for the love of God, try to behave.”</p><p>“Why is everyone so hung up on me behaving? And why am I the only one who has to?” Rio grumbles, flopping onto the couch. “Also, just a thought, you could’ve maybe asked me first before dumping me on babysitting duty.”</p><p>Lilia gives her a flat look. “You’re not babysitting the Princess.” She grabs the remote, turns off the TV, then folds her hands neatly in front of her. “She’s bringing someone along for these engagements. Your job is to simply show up, smile, and pretend you’re the best of friends. Or have you conveniently forgotten that part of the deal?”</p><p>Rio pouts, crossing her arms. She wants to keep complaining, but something else snags her attention. “She’s bringing a plus one?”</p><p>“Yes.” Lilia nods. “Jennifer Kale. I’m pretty sure you’ve seen her name in Agatha’s files.”</p><p>Rio had, in fact, read about Jennifer Kale. Agatha’s best friend from boarding school. A Florida heiress, rich as hell, but not the useless kind – because she actually does things.</p><p>At twenty-six, Jennifer took over her family’s multi-billion-dollar shipping empire and immediately pushed for eco-friendly innovations. When she’s not in boardrooms, she’s out in the field, funding clean water initiatives, disaster relief programs, sustainable housing projects, and running ultramarathons for charity. She also manages her own luxury skincare brand, one that’s somehow organic, scientifically backed, and wildly popular with celebrities. </p><p>She’s got a lot going on, to say the least. And Rio just can’t seem to figure out how someone like her fits into Agatha’s world. Agatha, who barely gets to make her own choices, whose whole life is scheduled down to the minute, trapped under the weight of royal expectations. How does a princess with zero agency become best friends with a woman who can literally wake up and decide to skydive over the Swiss Alps just for fun?</p><p>Lilia doesn’t even look up from her other paperwork when she says, “For heaven’s sake, stop pacing. It’s getting annoying, and you’re starting to give me a headache.”</p><p>Rio stops in her tracks, frowning. “I just think it’s a bit over the top for a royal to be hanging around for three days. Like, why? She’s got the state dinner, maybe a couple of handshakes, some photo ops, then it’s over. Job’s done. No need to make a whole vacation out of it.” She huffs in frustration, kicking at a chair that’s just slightly out of place. “It’s like, can’t she just do her thing and leave as soon as she’s done? Why does she need to stick around?”</p><p>Lilia suspiciously raises her brows, “Okay, kiddo, why are you so pressed about this? Haven’t you been in correspondence with her for months?”</p><p>Rio scoffs, completely caught off guard. Right. Why was she so worked up about the Princess sticking around for a few days instead of just passing through? Yeah, they’d been exchanging texts for a while, but what was the big deal about her staying? </p><p>Well, it’s different when the person you’ve been texting isn’t just a message on your screen anymore. It’s one thing to enjoy chatting with Agatha from a safe distance. That part was easy. But the idea of actually, physically being in the same space after all that back-and-forth? Yeah, that was nowhere near Rio’s bingo card.</p><p>“I don’t know where you’re getting that from, but I haven't been <em> corresponding </em> with her.”</p><p>Lilia maintains eye contact, clearly unimpressed. “Really?” </p><p>“Yes, really.”</p><p>It took every ounce of Rio’s willpower to lie in the face of this terrifying Sicilian woman. Lilia, as Rio liked to call her, was a seer. She could sense things, notice details, catch onto things before they were even supposed to be noticed. She could sniff out bullshit from a mile away. But over the years, Rio had gotten good at lying to her. Or at least, she thought she had.</p><p>Lilia checks her watch, then wastes no time steering the conversation elsewhere. “Right. Whatever. Now that you’re all caught up, let’s move on to something just as important. Your fitting for the state dinner is at four, and the team from Herrera is flying in to make final adjustments.”</p><p>Rio groans immediately. “Oh, come on…”</p><p>“Save it,” Lilia cuts in. “They are already on their way. You’ll stand there, let them do their job, and wear whatever they put you in without complaint.”</p><p>“Says the woman who gets to wear whatever she wants.”</p><p>Lilia doesn’t even bother looking up as she flips through another set of papers. </p><p>“Would you rather be wearing a rental?”</p><p>“Yes. And a suit would be nice,” Rio mutters, slumping deeper into the couch. </p><p>“Well, too bad. It’s a gown. A very expensive one, so I’d advise against any funny business. No spilling drinks, no sneaking out of it early, and definitely no picking a fight with the Princess in it.”</p><p>Rio crosses her arms. “Why does everyone act like I’m a walking liability?”</p><p>Lilia gives her a pointed look. “I don’t know. Maybe take it up with the sixty-five-thousand-pound cake and your generous alcohol consumption that kicked off this entire fiasco.”</p><hr /><p>Rio remembers the weekends in their cramped apartment, watching soccer with her dad. How he’d fan her with an old magazine when their AC broke down for the nth time in the middle of summer. She also remembers the way her dad’s face fell when she grew more and more obsessed with American baseball than fútbol. She also remembers coming home from school, devastated over missing Postman Pat, only for her dad to distract her with freshly fried tostones.</p><p>It was always just the two of them at home whenever her mom was off handling political affairs, working rooms full of powerful people, or doing whatever important thing needed to be done. Meanwhile, her dad held down the fort at home, making sure Rio was fed, entertained, and never felt left behind.</p><p>As a kid, she never questioned it. Most of her classmates had moms picking them up from school, but Rio had her dad. It wasn’t something she thought much about. Her mom had work, so she was with her dad. Simple. She didn’t realize until she was older that most fathers would have struggled with that arrangement. Maybe even hated it. But Carlos Vidal never did. He gladly stepped back so his wife could chase her ambition while he handled things at home.</p><p>Now, as Rio watches him in the White House kitchen, glazing honey over freshly baked quesitos, his <em> First Gentleman </em> apron slightly askew, and moving around like he’s still in their tiny old kitchen, she feels that same old admiration bubble up.</p><p>Carlos glances up, spotting his daughter. “That might be a new record,” he says, noting how quickly Rio made her way downstairs. “Let me guess, shortcut through the east wing or the scenic route past Rose Garden?”</p><p>“Southern route,” Rio says as she slides into a chair by the counter. “Service stairwell, past the portrait hallway, quick detour through the china room, then a straight shot through the staff corridor. Minimal foot traffic, highly efficient.” </p><p>The first thing Rio realized when she moved into the White House was just how ridiculously massive it was. It was nothing compared to their cramped apartment in Elsmere. It wasn’t just fancier, but bigger in a way that still sometimes threw her off. The place sat on 18 acres of land, had 132 rooms, including 16 for guests and family, three kitchens, and a whopping 35 bathrooms. She was pretty sure she got lost at least once in their first year living here. </p><p>She reaches for a quesito, only for Carlos to smack her hand away.</p><p>“Not so fast, princesa,” he says, tapping his cheek. “Toll payment first.”</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes, but she still leans in to press a quick kiss to her dad’s cheek. Just as she reaches for the pastry again, he tilts his head and taps the other cheek. </p><p>She snorts. “Pretty sure this qualifies as price gouging.”</p><p>“Oh, please. What’s a dad gotta do to get a little premium daughter tax around here?” Carlos says, finally sliding her a plate and pressing a quick kiss to her temple.</p><p>Rio laughs before biting into the quesito, oblivious to her father’s knowing look as he breaks off a piece for himself. “So, what’s your excuse for being up this late?” he asks. “Shouldn’t you be getting your beauty sleep? Big day tomorrow. Lots of cameras, lots of people.”</p><p>Rio leans on the counter, propping her elbows up. “Couldn’t sleep. Figured I’d come down and keep my old man from overthinking the same ten things for the hundredth time.”</p><p>Carlos chuckles. “Just making sure everything’s in order for tomorrow. You know how it goes.” He tosses the empty pastry tray into the sink. “This one’s very important. With your mom’s reelection around the corner, we can’t afford any slip-ups.”</p><p>“Dad, you’ve been running state dinners for over three years. At this point, you could do it in your sleep. If anything, you’re the one who should be resting.”</p><p>Carlos smiles as he tugs off his apron. “I will. Once I make sure the French ambassador isn’t going to throw a fit over the wine selection again.”</p><p>“Still holding a grudge over that Bordeaux incident?”</p><p>“Por supuesto,” her dad waves a hand like the mere thought exhausts him. “Some things one cannot forgive.” Rio laughs, but then Carlos gives her a look. One of those dad looks that says he knows more than his daughter’s letting on. “Besides, I’ve heard you’ve got a bigger role to worry about than I do.”</p><p>She opens her mouth to brush it off, but her brain betrays her completely. Because the real reason she’s still up isn't the cameras or the world leaders she’ll have to smile and shake hands with tomorrow. It’s Agatha. And for the life of her, she can’t figure out why.</p><p>Rio is halfway through her plate of quesito, while her dad continues to busy himself with last-minute prep for tomorrow, when her phone buzzes on the counter. She glances at the screen, expecting a text from Alice or maybe some last-minute directive from Lilia. </p><p>But instead, by pure coincidence, it’s her.</p><p><b> <em>Arthur Hardass:</em> </b> <em> “About to endure the most excruciatingly dull eight-hour flight of my life. The food at the White House better be worth it. Though, given America’s track record with cuisine, I won’t get my hopes up.” </em></p><p>Rio snorts, shaking her head as she wipes some pastry crumbs off her fingers. Even at 30,000 feet, Agatha somehow finds time to be a pain in her ass.</p><p><b> <em>Ralph Vines: </em> </b> <em> “Relax, Princess. I’m not planning revenge for whatever that was you made me eat last time. Just don’t steal my shine on my home turf, and your delicate royal stomach will be just fine.” </em></p><p>The reply comes almost instantly.</p><p><b> <em>Arthur Hardass:</em> </b> <em> “Oh, don’t worry. I’ll try to tone down my natural brilliance. Wouldn’t want you feeling insecure at your own event. You Americans tend to be rather sensitive about these things.” Then another text. “See you in a few hours, Vidal.”  </em></p><p>Rio stares at the screen for a second, then rolls her eyes and shoves her phone into her pocket, popping the last piece of her quesito into her mouth. She tells herself she’s not smiling. But, yeah, she definitely is. And she really shouldn’t be. She should be offering up a prayer to whatever gods are listening right now, hoping Agatha’s plane makes a U-turn straight back to Biscuit Land.</p><hr /><p>As soon as Rio steps into the hall, her eyes immediately find her parents stationed by the grand entrance, caught in their usual receiving line. Isabel, poised and elegant in an ivory gown, greets each guest with a flawless smile, while Carlos, effortlessly charismatic in his perfectly tailored tux, matches her with easy charm.</p><p>However, before Rio can even take another step, Alice suddenly materializes at her side. “Hey, take it easy on the booze tonight, alright?” she says, shooting Rio a stern look. “There’s no 65-thousand-pound cake this time, but we don’t need another headline of you and those expensive glasses of Château Margaux,” she adds, motioning toward the delicate tower of wine glasses stacked behind them, each one filled with $500-a-bottle wine.</p><p>“Oh, come on, I’m a highly responsible drinker.”</p><p>“I’m serious, Rio.”</p><p>Rio lets out an exaggerated sigh but reluctantly nods. “Fine, whatever, Agent Gulliver. I’ll keep it to a reasonable level,” she says with a shrug. But inside, she’s already mentally calculating how many glasses it’ll take before she can get away with it.</p><p>Spotting her daughter, Isabel’s smile softens immediately. “There you are,” she murmurs, reaching out to adjust an invisible strand of hair near her daughter’s ear. “You look lovely.”</p><p>Rio huffs a small laugh, leaning back just enough to dodge her mother’s fussing. “Mom, my hair hasn’t moved since I left my room. I swear it’s fine.”</p><p>“Forgive me for wanting my daughter to look her best.”</p><p>“As a matter of fact, I do look my best.” Rio gestures vaguely at herself, wearing a simple yet stylish dress by Herrera. The deep crimson satin fits her perfectly, showing off her curves without being too tight. A small slit on one side adds a bit of a bold touch to the otherwise classic look. “I’d say, I’m a solid ten out of ten.”</p><p>Her mother gives her a look but doesn’t bother hiding the fond smile tugging at her lips. </p><p>“And so very modest, too.”</p><p>But before Rio can throw out another quip at her mom, the hum of conversation immediately quiets just a bit as a few heads instinctively turn toward the entrance.</p><p>Draped in a rich sapphire gown, her hair falling in perfect waves over her shoulders, Agatha steps into the hall with the kind of effortless grace that Rio knows isn’t actually effortless. Everything about Agatha right now is so put-together. So polished, poised, and just distant enough to remind everyone exactly who she is.</p><p>And just like that, they’re all watching her. Rio included.</p><p>It’s the first time Rio has seen Agatha in person since her London trip, after months of casual (and not-so-casual) texting. Rio hadn’t exactly been counting down the days for this moment. In fact, she’d been avoiding it, hoping something would come up to delay Agatha’s arrival or give her a reason to bail, praying she’d find some excuse to not face this...whatever this is. But now that it’s here, she can’t shake this small, nagging regret for not just getting it over with sooner.</p><p>As Britain’s beloved blue eyes sweep across the glittering room, they finally land on America’s favorite hazel ones. For a second, neither of them moves. Then, Agatha tilts her head ever so slightly and offers Rio a perfectly polite, perfectly unreadable smile. </p><p>And Rio, because she’ll be damned if she’s the first to look away, lets a slow, knowing smile curl at the corner of her lips and sends it right back.</p><p>As Agatha steps closer, her smile remains effortlessly composed, her eyes locking with just Rio’s in a way that feels almost intentional. She greets the President first, then the President’s husband, before turning her full attention to the President’s daughter. Rio does her best not to look away, fighting the urge to break the stare, even as the intensity of the Princess’s presence presses on her.</p><p>Agatha’s smile turns just a bit more knowing as she leans in slightly. “Well, well. Looks like someone finally took a good look in the mirror.”</p><p>Rio raises an eyebrow, trying to keep her cool, even as her pulse betrays her. “What can I say? You Brits have a way of underestimating us Americans.”</p><p>“Underestimate you?” Agatha places a hand dramatically on her chest, pretending to be offended. “Dearest, I would never.” </p><p>“Well, that was dangerously close to a compliment.”</p><p>“Was it?” Agatha teases back, making Rio second-guess herself for a second but she quickly shakes it off with a forced smile.</p><p>“It’s alright, Your Highness. You can admit you missed me,” Rio says, flashing a teasing grin, hoping to catch Agatha off guard for once.</p><p>But Agatha just lets out a soft, genuine laugh, the sound warm in a way that catches Rio off guard instead. Before she even realizes it, she’s staring at the Princess longer than she intended, her cocky smirk melting into something else without meaning to.</p><p>“Oh, Miss Vidal,” Agatha says, her smile knowing, almost too knowing. “I will do no such thing.”</p><p>Rio’s mind short-circuits. She hates this woman. She’s supposed to hate this woman. She hates this woman with every fiber of her being. She’s been telling herself that. </p><p>But now, as she stands there, she can’t help but feel something else creeping in. The urge to wipe that damn shine from her ocean-blue eyes, to erase the blush from her cheeks, or most fucking of all, that smile on those luscious lips. </p><p>Rio fights the urge to let her eyes wander, knowing damn well where that could lead. God, she might need that entire glass tower of Château Margaux just to make it through this night…and most likely the next three days.</p>

  <p>
  <span>Looking at Agatha now almost feels like meeting a whole new person. Rio knows more about her, understands her in ways she wishes she didn’t, and can even recognize how rare that genuine smile is on that universally admired face. Not that it changes anything. Not that it matters. She still hates that same universally admired face, which is exactly why she spends the rest of the night expertly dodging her, drifting through different conversations, keeping just enough distance to make it seem natural.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They’ve already posed for a few pictures, and she has three more days of this. Pretty sure the tabloids won’t notice a little strategic avoidance. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And yet, it’s still messing with her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha then and Agatha now, two versions of the same person overlapping in Rio’s brain, stirring up something unsettling and, annoyingly, a little too warm under her ribs. That, or it’s the four glasses of $500-a-bottle wine gradually working their way through her system.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s the usual chatter, the clinking of glasses, and a speech from Isabel about the administration’s latest push for positive immigration policies and expanded healthcare initiatives. Rio half-listens, but no matter how hard she tries to focus, her eyes keep drifting across the room, undeniably drawn, despite herself – to the Princess.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The culprit behind Rio’s current turmoil, not that she’d ever call it that, is standing with Jennifer and another woman Rio vaguely recognizes as an ambassador from some Manhattan convention. Whatever they’re talking about must be hilarious, judging by the way Jennifer practically doubles over laughing. Agatha, on the other hand, remains perfectly composed, her expression unreadable to most. But not Rio. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio used to mistake that neutral face for disinterest. Now, she seemingly knows better. That’s not indifference. It’s actually amusement, hidden just well enough to fool most people. And for some reason, that realization makes Rio take a longer sip of her drink. Maybe a little too long until another conversation pulls her in and Agatha fades into the background.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Throughout the night, Rio slips seamlessly between groups, nodding along to half-heard conversations about trade agreements and diplomatic relations. She laughs when expected, adds a comment here and there, just enough to keep up appearances. But really, she’s keeping herself busy. Keeping herself distracted. It works, for a while.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then she’s outside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The cool night air is a welcome change as she steps onto the secluded terrace. She exhales slowly, rolls her shoulders, and reaches behind a flower pot where she keeps a stash of cigarettes for emergencies like this. The White House staff must turn a blind eye because, miraculously, no one has ever ratted her out to her mother. Rio figures they see her as a good kid. And to be fair, she is. Always have been. But even good kids do dumb things sometimes. And with Democrats for parents, she’s allowed to smoke, so long as it doesn’t kill her. Or, more realistically, as long as they don’t find out, because if they do, lung damage will be the least of Rio’s worries. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then again, she’s 28. A grown woman living in a free country that just happens to be run by her mother.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A quick flick of the lighter, and the familiar burn of nicotine settles her nerves. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Got another one?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio nearly jumps out of her skin. She quickly turns around to find Agatha standing a few feet behind: calm, collected, and far too amused for someone who just scared the hell out of her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jesus,” Rio mutters, pressing a hand to her chest. “You can’t just sneak up on people like that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wasn’t sneaking,” Agatha says, pushing the door shut behind her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, well, you’re freakishly quiet for someone in heels.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio turns back toward the railing, pretending she’s unbothered. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha just steps closer, and Rio swears she can feel it before she sees it. She flicks the ash off the end of her cigarette, willing her pulse to slow the hell down. She doesn’t look at Agatha, doesn’t trust herself to. “Are you even allowed?” she simply adds to fill the silence. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I'm not supposed to,” the Princess says as she steps up beside her, close enough that Rio catches that familiar lavender scent. So unmistakably Agatha. “But I’ll gladly take one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio takes a slow drag, then pulls out a cigarette from her stash, and hands it over. Agatha takes it between her fingers with that same effortless elegance she applies to everything. Rio passes her the lighter next, and for a second, she just watches the flame flicker, the glow catching on Agatha’s face, making her look softer. Warmer. Not that Rio is noticing. Nope. Not at all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She should look away. Should focus on something else. But then Agatha’s lips part, and the cigarette glows red as she inhales, and – Jesus Christ. Rio quickly turns to face the garden beyond the balcony before she does something incredibly stupid.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They stand there in silence for a moment, smoke curling between them, the muffled sounds of the party linger behind the heavy French doors. Agatha exhales slowly, her blue eyes settled on the soft glow of the Lincoln Memorial and the dark stretch of the Potomac beyond it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t take you for the brooding type.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio snorts, flicking ash off the railing. “I’m not brooding.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha gives her a sideways glance. “You’re standing on a balcony, smoking alone.” She takes another slow drag. “Where I come from, that’s textbook brooding.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio huffs but then the silence starts stretching a little too long for her liking, so she shifts, flicking ash off her cigarette. “So, speaking of,” she says casually, “Is England not exciting enough for you these days?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha turns her head slightly, raising an eyebrow. “I beg your pardon?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Didn’t you ask to stay here the whole weekend?” Rio takes a slow drag, then glances at Agatha. “What? Finally got sick of all the tea, crepes, and scones?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha hums, clearly entertained. “Is that all you think England is?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I mean, I could’ve said crappy weather and emotionally repressed people, but I was really trying to be nice, Your Highness,” Rio waves a hand vaguely, earning a look from Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How very thoughtful of you,” says the Princess. She also takes a slow drag of her cigarette and exhales, smoke curling lazily around her. Rio catches a hint of coldness in her tone, but she figures it’s just Agatha’s usual way of speaking. “Well, as charming as the palace is, I do enjoy a change of scenery every now and then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio scoffs. “Yeah, because the White House is such a wild change for someone like you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Personally, I’d say it’s a nice change. It’s definitely different enough,” Agatha watches the smoke drift upward. “Besides, I have a feeling I’ll enjoy myself here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, sure,” Rio scoffs, rolling her eyes. “Nothing like top-tier American hospitality for Her Royal Highness. Stuffy dinners where everyone pretends they’re having the time of their lives, way too many handshakes with people you’ll forget by morning, and just enough flag-waving to make it look like we all care. Yeah, sounds like your British ass is in for a real treat.” Rio immediately wants to slap herself. Why the hell is she talking so much?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha lets out a soft, almost bitter chuckle, tapping the ash from her cigarette.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was actually thinking more about the company.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s brain stalls for a second. She tells herself not to read into it, not to make it a thing. But then Agatha turns just enough to meet her eyes, and for a split second, Rio swears she sees something there. Something that makes her chest feel uncomfortably tight. It lingers a beat too long. Just long enough for Rio to feel it settle somewhere deep, warm, and entirely unwelcome.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fuck. The $500-a-bottle wine is definitely starting to mess with her. Stupid Château Margaux. Her dad should have just stuck with the Bordeaux. Rio’s throat feels weird too, so she clears it, shifts her weight, and is just about to look away when the door swings open, flooding their quiet with light and noise.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There you are,” Jennifer announces, stepping onto the terrace like she’s been searching for Agatha all evening. She’s holding a small plate of Fraisier, a clear sign that dessert has just been served.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hand quickly moves before her brain does. She flicks her cigarette butt into the nearest planter like a guilty teenager sneaking a smoke after school. Agatha, on the other hand, just watches her and snorts. Completely unbothered by being caught, she takes one last slow drag before casually tossing hers away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Florida heiress steps forward, left hand on her hips, one brow arched in mock offense as she eyes both women before zeroing in on the Princess. “You snuck off for a smoke and didn’t think to invite me?”  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha doesn’t even blink. She simply lifts a hand and lazily points at Rio.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes go wide in disbelief. “Excuse me? You basically invited yourself here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But you’re the one with the stash,” Agatha says easily before turning to the newcomer. “Glad you finally found me, Jen. I take it you two haven’t been introduced yet.” She gestures between them. “Not that Rio here really needs an introduction. You’ve probably seen her on the news a couple of times. Hard to miss a face like that on international television – kind of unforgettable, really.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio barely has time to react before Agatha continues, “And Rio,” she adds smoothly, “this is Jennifer Kale, one of my many oldest and most unfortunate friends.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jennifer rolls her eyes. “One of many? Try only.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha shoots Jennifer a dagger-eyed look, and the latter simply shrugs, extending her available hand toward the President’s daughter. “Pleasure to meet you, Rio. Gotta say, TV doesn’t exactly do you enough justice. You’ve got way better skin in person,” she says with a friendly smile. “Also, this cake? Insanely divine. You’ve got to let Agatha know who your pastry chef is. Kensington could seriously use a dessert upgrade. Have either of you tried this yet?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before Rio can get a word in, Agatha cuts in coolly, “Don’t bother. She doesn’t like strawberries.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That makes Rio turn her head, completely surprised. How the hell did she remember that?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She’s about to say something else when Agatha keeps going, “Anyway, I would have introduced you both a little more formally earlier if a certain someone hadn’t been purposefully avoiding me all night.” She eyes the other woman, who looks more caught off guard by the sudden reveal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Rio mutters, blinking, unsure if she’s hearing things right. Agatha just looks at her, and for a second, just a second, Rio thinks she sees something almost hurt in those sharp blue eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jennifer, either oblivious to the tension or thoroughly enjoying it, claps a hand on Agatha’s shoulder. “As much as I’d love to join you both for a chat, Agatha is needed inside for a quick speech.” She gives the Princess a light pat on the back, then tosses Rio a wink before making her way to the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha breaths. “Right. Duty calls.” But just as she turns to leave and follow Jennifer, she turns back to Rio. There’s a hint of irritation, maybe even disappointment, in her voice. “Back in London, you did say we’re on a truce, did you not? And now that I’m actually here, perhaps you should start acting like it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then she’s gone, swallowed up by the warmth and chatter inside, leaving Rio standing there, cigarette forgotten, and pulse annoyingly out of whack.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>The next morning, Rio is, unsurprisingly, running late. Not that this is anything new. She’s the type who swears she’ll be on time, sets alarms with the best intentions, and then somehow still gets caught up in something else entirely. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s a habit that gets her in trouble more often than not. Sure, it’s not exactly ideal. Maybe even a little frustrating and downright annoying for everyone else. Especially for Lilia, most of the time. But hey, research says it’s just how creative minds work. Or so they claim.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And today is worse. So much worse. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Because last night, sleep didn’t come easy. She’d spent way too long staring at the ceiling, tossing and turning, thinking about something, or rather, someone, she would very much prefer not to name. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s ridiculous. Irritating. And now, thanks to all that pointless overthinking, her hair is a total mess, her McQueen blouse is only half-buttoned, and she’s wrestling with her blazer while blindly reaching for her phone, which keeps buzzing with notifications. She glances at the clock and groans.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio bolts down the stairs, nearly missing a step as she tries to shove her phone into her pocket. She flies past Herb and the rest of her security detail with a half-assed wave. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Lilia, standing by the entrance with her arms crossed, gives her a look like she’s five years old and about to be scolded. The older woman opens her mouth, but Rio beats her to it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know, I know, I’m sorry!” she calls out, rushing past before Lilia can get another word in.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Outside, the black SUV is already waiting. Alice stands by the door, while William is right beside her. Rio mentally kicks herself, of course William is here. Agatha and William basically come as a set. Wherever Agatha goes, her esquire follows. She just hadn’t spotted him at the state dinner last night. Strange. But she doesn’t even have time right now to wonder why.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice swings open the door as Rio reaches them, but instead of greeting her, she holds out a pair of sunglasses. “So the sun doesn’t blind you, and to hide the fact that you look like shit,” she says flatly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio groans, shoving them onto her face. “Who the hell decided 6 AM was a reasonable call time?” She pulls out her phone, skims the itinerary, and nearly gags. Jesus Christ, a veterans’ breakfast? She should’ve reread this entire itinerary last night to brace herself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Inside the car, Agatha is already seated, her own sunglasses in place, looking untouched by the ungodly hour. Jennifer, riding shotgun, is fully immersed in her phone, probably making calls to suppliers or clients or whoever needs dealing with this early.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Morning,” Rio mutters as she slides into the backseat next to Agatha, keeping a noticeable feet of distance between them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She gets nothing in return. That’s another strange thing added to her list. Was the Princess genuinely upset that Rio had deliberately avoided her last night? Probably. Because all Rio gets is the faintest shift as Agatha lifts her polished silver travel cup and takes a slow sip, like she’s also been up for hours and is merely tolerating everyone else’s struggle. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio bites back a snort. Or maybe the bed in Blair House had a pea under all those plush sheets, leaving the Princess a bit restless. Or, more likely, maybe jet lag was excruciatingly catching up to her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And yet, with the morning sun behind the latter, she still looks almost unreal. Rio thinks it, then promptly deletes the thought. It’s way too early for her to entertain dangerously stupid thoughts. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before they pull out, William opens the door on Agatha’s side, passing her a small pill. Without hesitation, Agatha takes the pill and washes it down with a sip from her cup, like it’s muscle memory. Rio just watches for half a second before deciding she absolutely does not want to ask.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The veterans’ breakfast plays out like a montage in Rio’s mind. One of those sequences where everything blurs together in a series of quick cuts, with her right in the middle of it.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Cut to: </b>
  <span>Plates clinking, the warm smell of bacon, waffles, and way too much maple syrup. The veterans settle into their seats, some moving slowly with age, others still carrying themselves with the stiff discipline of their service days. The host says something about unity and international partnerships. Rio claps when everyone else does, just a beat too late.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Cut to: </b>
  <span>Handshakes. Too many handshakes. Firm grips, rough palms. Rio’s hand is starting to cramp, but she pushes through. She wants to pay attention. Really, she does. Her body is here, nodding, throwing in the right sounds of agreement, but her brain is still in bed, begging for just one more hour of sleep.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Cut to:</b>
  <span> A retired general in his seventies, telling a story so detailed Rio’s pretty sure it could be turned into a whole movie. She tries, really tries, to keep up. She nods, responds when needed. But at some point, she completely loses the plot, and now she’s just hoping to God this story doesn’t end in something tragic, because she’s already smiled twice.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Cut to:</b>
  <span> Princess Agatha. Thriving. Back straight, calm and collected. Everyone hangs onto her words like she’s dropping fucking pure gold. She lets out a light laugh at something an old Navy commander says, and Rio hates that it hooks her attention like a damn magnet.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Cut to: </b>
  <span>Coffee. Finally. Rio grips the cup like it’s the only thing keeping her sane. The first sip is actual salvation. If she weren’t surrounded by cameras and military heroes, she might just kiss the damn mug.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Cut to: </b>
  <span>Agatha standing up for her speech. The room falls silent. She doesn’t even look at the prepared notes in front of her. Instead, she just speaks with that effortless confidence that makes people pay attention. Rio watches her, sipping her coffee, trying not to notice the way the Princess’ voice dips just slightly lower when she gets serious.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>Cut to: </b>
  <span>Applause. Breakfast finally wrapping up. Then photos. Lots of them, where Rio ends up shoulder to shoulder with Agatha, the crowd closing in from all sides. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then Rio spots her exit and makes a break for the car, only to realize Agatha’s right behind her. Jen, for whatever reason, decides to ride with Alice and the rest of the security detail, leaving the two of them alone in silence again, headed to the next stop on Agatha’s never-ending itinerary. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sunglasses on, Rio leans back and shuts her eyes. It’s gonna be a long fucking day.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She must have dozed off, because the next thing she knows, the car jolts over a bump and her head jerks up from where it had been pressed against the window. Blinking away the sleep, her first blurry line of sight lands on Agatha – or more specifically, Agatha looking right at her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As if caught in the act, the Princess quickly turns her head back to the window. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A little confused, but sensing an opportunity to throw Agatha off, Rio stretches, rubs the back of her neck, and mutters, “Were you enjoying the view, or just happened to be staring at me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Without missing a beat, Agatha replies, eyes still on the passing scenery, “I’ve seen better.” Then, after a beat, she adds, “I was actually more concerned you’d start drooling on the leather seats.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t drool.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You breathe like a mildly injured horse.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio glares at her. “You’re weirdly meaner in the mornings.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha shifts, turning to look at her like she’s about to say something. Then she stops, mouth half open, before snapping it shut again. She turns back to the window, but not before she adds, “Well, you’re weirdly hard to read.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And what’s that supposed to mean?” Rio raises an eyebrow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha doesn’t even look at her when she replies, “Why were you avoiding me last night?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I already told you, I wasn’t,” Rio snaps, her heart skipping a beat at the question.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re not a very good liar, Rio.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio wants to throw herself out of the car the second she hears her name come out of Agatha’s mouth. Seriously, why does the Princess saying her name mess with her head like that? Rio shoots her a side-eye. “Okay, fine. Let’s say I </span>
  <em>
    <span>was</span>
  </em>
  <span> avoiding you. Why the hell are you so upset about it?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am not.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, you are.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am not upset.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You clearly are.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am clearly this close to throwing you out of this car, so just shut it,” Agatha warns. Rio almost considers letting her. She doesn’t even know why they’re having this argument in the first place. Why does Agatha care if she’s been avoiding her? Maybe royals really are just narcissistic bitches.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The rest of the day drags on with the two of them expertly avoiding each other, exchanging only the bare minimum of words, and posing for a few staged photos for the press. If Agatha wants it this way, then Rio’s more than happy to go along with it. Honestly, she figures it’s probably for the best. Keeping their distance is easier, especially with how often they seem to be stuck in the same room together.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, they arrive at the last stop on today’s itinerary. Rio’s no stranger to Beauvoir, having attended a few events here before, so she knows what to expect. The kids always get ridiculously excited when someone “important” shows up, and as soon as they step inside, a flood of curious little faces turns toward them. Just like in England, where the British kids bombarded Rio with questions, it was now Agatha’s turn to be bombarded by curious American children. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio braces herself for the onslaught, but this time, it’s all directed at Agatha. She barely catches the rest of the questions thrown to the Princess, but a few stand out: Do you really live in a real castle? Can we come visit? Do you ride horses? How many pretty dresses do you own? Are you friends with Cinderella, Snow White, or Rapunzel? Do mice and birds talk to you? Do animals come to you when you sing? Do you have an evil stepmother? Where’s your prince charming?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio can’t help but pay attention to the last one, wondering what Agatha’s response will be. She’s seen the headlines before, all those blurry photos of Agatha out and about with some duke or the occasional British heartthrob. The internet loves to speculate, always pairing her with some polished aristocrat or a posh actor with good hair and zero personality. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not that it really matters to Rio. But still, like the kids, she’s low-key wondering. Who the hell would actually date someone like Agatha anyway? The woman’s got walls higher than Buckingham and an attitude strong enough to scare off half the British aristocracy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And as Rio watches her, she feels something twist in her stomach. It takes her back to the first time she saw that younger version of the Princess in a magazine. The way she seemed so confident, like she could do anything. Watching her talk to these kids, smile, and laugh, is starting to get under Rio’s skin. Maybe she’s jealous at the way Agatha can be so graceful and so at ease with all this attention. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And because Rio’s too caught up in her thoughts, she doesn’t notice how much she’s staring until Agatha catches her eye for a moment. Rio quickly looks away, not wanting to admit how much it bothers her that Agatha is so good at this. That she’s so damn good at everything. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thankfully, the day came to an end when they made it back to the White House grounds. And just as Rio’s patience was starting to wear thin, Agatha decided to skip dinner and retire early to Blair House. Rio couldn't help but appreciate that for once. At least the princess knows how to read the room.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But that appreciation didn’t last long. Not when Rio finds herself tossing and turning in bed, the thought of Agatha </span>
  <em>
    <span>genuinely</span>
  </em>
  <span> being upset with her gnawing at her brain and screwing with her fucking sleep. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio did agree to a truce. And, God help her, they’d even kind of bonded over months of text chains like semi-functioning friends. So why the hell was she suddenly acting like she couldn’t get far enough away from Agatha now? Sometimes, even Rio couldn’t make sense of her own brain. Maybe it’s the curse of being a genius in both science and the arts – overcomplicating things just comes with the package.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Stupidly, Rio glances at the clock, throws on her hoodie, and trudges downstairs. She finds herself rummaging through the pantry and ends up with two of her dad's leftover empanadas. She tosses them in the microwave, already regretting the whole idea the second the plate starts spinning, and seriously considers banging her head against the door.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But before she can talk herself out of it, she’s already out on the street, crossing Pennsylvania Avenue in the middle of the night with a plate of warm empanadas in hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She’s halfway across the street when she slows, squinting through the dim streetlights. There, sitting on the stairs outside Blair House, is Agatha, dressed in a robe, her hair messy and damp like she’s just come out of the shower. One of the security guys lurks in the background, trying his best to blend into the shadows while the Princess just sits there. Rio watches her for a second, unsure what she’s looking at.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luckily for both of them, it’s already two in the morning and no press is around to snap photos. This definitely would’ve been a headline. Rio can’t help but think of it as a headline in her own mind as she walks toward Agatha, holding her sad little plate like an idiot.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She isn’t sure what’s throwing her off more: the fact that Agatha looks completely lost in thought, or the fact that she’s outside, in the middle of the night, still looking unfairly pretty while probably spiraling like the rest of them. Rio clears her throat softly, trying not to feel like an intruder. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know there’s a whole bed with big fluffy pillows inside, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha turns, eyes wide for a second before quickly schooling her expression into something harder to read. “What are you doing here?” she asks, her gaze briefly landing on the plate Rio’s holding.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio blinks. “Uh, I brought some snacks. You weren’t around for dinner, so I figured you might be hungry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha just stares at her for a second. Rio’s already feeling like an idiot and wonders if Agatha’s thinking the same thing. “Well, that’s…painfully American of you,” the latter says dryly. “And in case it slipped your mind, the guest house has its own kitchen I could’ve rummaged through.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio clicks the inside of her cheek. Yep. Agatha definitely thinks she’s an idiot. “Actually, it's more of an apology,” she says, shrugging and looking off to the side. “I know I was being a bit of a bitch all day.” Then she glances back. “But let’s be real, you’re not exactly sunshine and rainbows either. Honestly, I don’t even know why I’m the one apologizing here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Princess raises an eyebrow, but doesn’t say anything at first. Rio can feel the silence hanging between them, and she starts to wonder if she went too far. Finally, Agatha breaks it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You do know that’s not how apologies usually work, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio scoffs. “Yeah, well, I didn’t really expect you to know that, Your Highness. You don’t exactly strike me as someone who dishes out a lot of sorrys.” She notices the look Agatha gives her, and figures she might’ve pushed it a bit. So, she softens, just slightly, and holds out the plate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Anyway, I wasn’t about to show up in full shining armor, so this felt like the next best thing. My dad made these, so saying no would basically be disrespecting him – and Puerto Rico, which is where he’s from. And I actually took the time to heat these up before walking over here, at this hour, so turning them down would just be straight-up rude.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>To her surprise, Agatha shifts over just a little, enough to feel like an unspoken invitation. And since Rio was already halfway to pathetic, she took it. She sat down beside her on the cold steps, not saying a word as Agatha reached for an empanada. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We wouldn’t want to disrespect your dad and the Puerto Ricans now, would we?” the Princess muttered, dry but not unkind, before taking a bite. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio catches herself staring a second too long and quickly looks away when Agatha glances back. “I would've brought another one if I knew you had company,” she says instead, nodding toward the brooding security guy standing in the back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha just shrugs, chewing slowly as she swallows the bite. “He’s not company. He's more like my personal shadow with a badge,” she says dryly, but there’s still a hint of affection in it. She glances over her shoulder, gives the guy a wink. “No offense, Jimmy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jimmy Woo, standing dutifully a few feet back, straightens up slightly, trying not to smile. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“None taken, Your Highness.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha throws him a casual little salute with two fingers, then turns back to Rio. “His job here is basically making sure I don’t end up on the cover of an American tabloid for doing something utterly stupid.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio snorts before she can stop herself. “Right, well, you’re not exactly making his job easy, are you? I mean, you’re out here in the dead of night, in a damn robe, sitting on the steps with me, of all people. Pretty sure that’s not exactly what your royal advisers would call great decision-making.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha turns to her with a look, equal parts unimpressed and faintly amused. “I’m not a toddler, Rio. I’m perfectly capable of making my own stupid decisions.” She takes another bite of her empanada, then with her mouth half full, she adds, “And sitting out here with you, of all people – as you pointed out, is hardly the worst one I’ve made.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio can’t help but smile at that, despite herself. Agatha’s got a way of being sassy, yet still strangely self-aware and unapologetically royal, and Rio can’t decide if she finds it endearing or just intimidating. Maybe a little bit of both. Her eyes linger on Agatha for a moment too long before she looks away, feeling that knot in her stomach again that she really doesn’t want to think about.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She shifts uncomfortably, pushing her plate between them like it's some sort of shield. “So, what’s the deal?” she starts, leaning back slightly against the step. “What’s got Her Royal Highness loitering on the front steps of Blair House at two in the damn morning? Don’t tell me your British ass is already second-guessing your grand tour of America.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha finishes chewing, then wipes her mouth delicately with the back of her hand before responding. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but the British princess doesn’t exactly sleep much. There are plenty of articles out there calling her a bit of an insomniac. I’m actually quite surprised you haven’t come across one, seeing as you’re so bloody determined to outwit me all the time.” She glances at Rio, blue eyes sharp but thoughtful. “And no, I’m not second-guessing anything. You Americans, honestly – you lot are mad obsessed with royalty. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t appreciate all the attention.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Revisiting her earlier thought, maybe the Princess isn’t a full-blown narcissistic bitch after all. Real ones never admit they love the spotlight. But Rio’s eyebrows furrow at Agatha’s words. “Is that what the pills are for?” she asks, as she watches Agatha carefully. “The ones you took earlier, and the ones back in London before that interview.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha doesn’t answer right away. She looks away, her eyes drifting to the dark street, like she’s trying to decide how much she wants to share. “Well, you don’t miss much, do you?” she says finally, clearly trying to deflect. “God forbid a woman needs something to calm her nerves or, you know, just make it through the day without losing her shit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio lifts a brow, trying to play it cool. “You don’t really seem like someone who loses her shit.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha scoffs, biting her lip to stop herself from smiling, a little too bitter for her usual calm. She turns to Rio, tilting her head just enough for the streetlight to catch her profile. “Is that why you hate me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The question lands hard, and Rio can’t help but feel taken aback by how easily Agatha flips the switch. The Princess really knows how to throw the heat back, deflecting anything too personal with a question that demands an answer.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t hate you,” Rio says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, you do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t,” she repeats. “Why do you keep insisting that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha breaths, something between a laugh and a sigh. “Because I’m not stupid, Rio. I know when someone hates me. I’ve had a lifetime of practice,” she adds, looking away now, her eyes fixed somewhere out in the dark. “I should know. My own mother does.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She says it so casually, like it’s just another fact, and then keeps going as if she hadn’t just dropped a bomb in the middle of the conversation. “And you already admitted it back in London. Maybe not exactly in words, but it wasn’t really hard to read between the lines.” She glances over, her eyes meeting Rio’s. “Don’t you think I deserve to know why America's First Daughter hates me so much?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you sure you want this conversation to go there?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wouldn’t have insisted if I wasn’t.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio drags a hand through her hair, her breath coming out in a frustrated rush. “You seriously don’t remember being a complete bitch to me two years ago? At the UN Summit, when we first met?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio remembers it clearly, almost too vividly. Her first major international event as the First Daughter, feeling completely out of place, and mostly hiding behind champagne to calm herself. And she remembers the first time she saw Agatha: her dark brown hair falling in soft waves around her shoulders, dressed in a perfectly tailored black suit, and an odd-looking locket hanging at her neck that she fidgeted with whenever her hands were free.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha shakes her head, looking puzzled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Really? You seriously don't remember?” Rio presses, not backing down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I genuinely don’t. So why don’t you go on and remind me then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio hesitates before finally letting it out. If Agatha really wants to know, then she’s going to hear it now, because Rio has no intention of repeating herself. “I walked right up to you, tried to introduce myself, tried to make small talk, but you didn’t even look at me. Didn’t even bother shaking my hand, and then, to make things worse, you turned to your security, or whoever was with you, and told them that you didn’t want to see my face, like I was some kind of stalker or psychopath.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio looks away, not wanting to see what Agatha’s reaction might be. She’s not sure if she’s expecting an apology, a shrug, or some excuse, but whatever it is, she’s certain that Agatha should feel bad for making her feel that way two years ago.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Agatha says after a pause, clearing her throat. “I didn’t realize you actually heard that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio scoffs, shaking her head. “I can’t believe that’s what you took away from what I just said.” She looks back at Agatha. “You were rude. You were mean. Basically, you were a bitch. And honestly, the fact that you think not hearing it would’ve made things better is still a pretty bitchy thought.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another long pause. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Really? You’ve got nothing else to say to that?” Rio presses again, watching as the Princess looks away. Her hands fidget for a moment, as if looking for something to do, before she ends up tugging at the hem of her robe.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine,” Agatha finally mutters. “I guess I could’ve been a bit nicer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You </span>
  <em>
    <span>guess</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” Rio just rolls her eyes, and another pause hangs between them. Of course, the Princess wouldn’t actually apologize. She probably never had to in her whole life, so why would she start with Rio?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“All right, what else?” It’s Agatha’s turn to press. “It couldn’t have just been that, right? I’m sure there are plenty more times you’ve had reason to loathe me.” But Rio stays silent, realizing too late that she probably sounds ridiculous, because she can’t think of any other time she actually hated Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes widen, and Rio swears she wants to poke those smug blue orbs. “Wait, are you actually serious? Just that?” she asks, but Rio doesn’t answer. “God, it is, isn’t it? Just that one time?” She tries to hold back a laugh, but Rio’s glare shuts her right up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t you dare downplay it,” Rio snaps.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha holds up her hands. “Downplay it? Dearest, how could I possibly? It’s already as downplayed as it gets.” She snaps right back. Then pauses, staring at Rio like she’s the unhinged one in this conversation. “Are you seriously telling me that one interaction, two years ago, mind you, where I might have been slightly, kind of a cow, has been living rent-free in your head ever since? That’s it? That’s the whole reason you’ve hated me all this time?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, when you put it like that, it sounds stupid…but whatever, the point is,” Rio raises her voice just enough to let the frustration slip through. “It wasn’t just some random meeting for me, okay? It was my first time stepping into the world, my first international engagement as a public figure. I was nervous as hell, and you could’ve helped me feel like I wasn’t completely drowning, but instead of showing even a little decency, you rudely shut me down.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio keeps going. “It was already hard for me, being the daughter of the first female president. I’m not white. Hell, I don’t even look like I could pass for it. People still call me America’s most expensive diversity hire. And you? You were born into this world of status, of privilege. You don’t get it, but you’re a walking reminder that no matter how hard I work, no matter how much I do, I’m always going to be measured against someone else. Someone who never had to try nearly as hard.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio didn’t realize how much of that sentiment she had bottled up until the words came spilling out. She couldn’t bring herself to look at Agatha, who had gone quiet for a while. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Agatha finally speaks, “It’s quite too late for me to change any of it now. But I must admit, I was indeed a bitch that day. Not that it excuses anything, but I was a bitch to everyone during those days." Rio slowly glances at her, and Agatha seems to brace herself before continuing. “My father had just died a few months before that, and the Palace,</span>
  <em>
    <span> my mother</span>
  </em>
  <span>, insisted on parading me around like I was fine. Well, I clearly was not, hence, the bitching…so, I’m sorry.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The apology comes out almost as a whisper, but Rio catches it just enough. A sudden thought hits her as she remembers reading about Agatha’s father in the files she’d gone through. He died two years ago. How had Rio overlooked that? The funeral had been all over the news. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s brain then flashes to a clip she’d seen: Agatha, just a bit younger, draped in black, her sunglasses sitting high on her nose, looking more like a stranger than the princess. She also recalls a certain tabloid headline about how Agatha hadn’t attended the actual funeral at Westminster Abbey but had been spotted afterward, walking alone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then Rio travels back to two years ago in her mind. She remembers the way Agatha would make that little scowl in public, a look that Rio had always read as being aloof. But now, she’s starting to see it differently: Agatha standing alone, forced into the crowd, all while she was still grieving her own father, not really allowed the time or space to mourn properly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Grief had never been a stranger to Rio. She remembers when her abuelita passed and how her dad locked himself in his room for days, leaving her mom to take over everything at home for quite some time. Then there was the loss of her first dog when she was ten. Her little terrier, ironically named </span>
  <b>Gato</b>
  <span>, had been her constant companion, and when he died, they buried him in the small, neglected lot behind their apartment. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio could still feel the sting of that day, curled up in her mom’s lap, tears soaking her shirt as her dad silently dug the hole. She never really considered that Agatha could know that kind of pain, or that the princess might be just as human in her grief as anyone else.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha clears her throat, and Rio feels this sudden jolt of panic. But before she can even open her mouth, Agatha cuts in again. “And just to clarify, I never really said I didn’t want to see your face. I said I didn’t want people taking pictures in front of mine. Easily misheard but completely different things.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another pause. Rio couldn't even count how many there had been.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” she says, feeling a bit embarrassed. “Now I kinda feel like I owe you an apology too.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And for the record,” Agatha starts again, calmer now, “if things had been different back then...yeah, I probably still would’ve been a bit of a prick, but I guess I could’ve been nicer. If I hadn’t been so caught up in my own stuff, I really would’ve loved to talk to you, especially after seeing that speech you gave at your mum’s campaign rally. What you said about women owning their power really stuck with me, and I would’ve genuinely enjoyed having a conversation with you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She looks away, as if the vulnerability stings a bit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio doesn’t quite know how to react, so she opens her mouth and says, “Well, it’s nice to know the Princess of England is as obsessed with me as everyone else.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio can almost hear Agatha rolling her eyes, and for some reason, it feels oddly reassuring. The usual, comfortable back-and-forth between them. The tension from earlier starts to die down, making the silence between them a little less awkward. Rio glances around at the stillness of the night, realizing how strange it is that it’s 2 AM and they’ve ended up here, sitting on the cold steps outside Blair House. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She also can’t help but wonder how Jimmy’s doing, stuck at the back, having to watch a meltdown between two of the most tweeted-about people in the past few weeks. At least he's got that NDA and a fat paycheck to ease the pain.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A long stretch of silence passes, and then, out of nowhere, Agatha speaks again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m actually worried about tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A beat of confusion. “What?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“To answer your question earlier,” Agatha adds, looking out at the empty street, “why I’m out here. I’m a bit worried about tomorrow’s itinerary. I don’t know the first thing about American baseball, Jimmy’s completely clueless too, and I’m genuinely terrified I’ll make a fool of myself.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio blinks, almost choking on her own laughter. “You’re having an existential crisis over baseball?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t make light of it,” Agatha retorts, though there’s no real heat behind it. “I take my engagements rather seriously, alright? Unlike some people, I don’t just wing it and hope for the best.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio stops laughing when she sees how serious Agatha actually is. A weird sense of responsibility to calm her down kicks in, so she offers a more genuine smile this time. “Alright, alright,” she says, holding up her hands. “I’m sorry for laughing, but seriously, Your Highness, you have nothing to freak out about. You’re literally sitting next to the Dodgers’ number one fan.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The what now?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio chuckles, that little gap between her teeth showing as she grins. She can’t help it. The Princess actually stressing over baseball is too good. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The Dodgers. One of the biggest teams in baseball history. Very huge deal in LA. You know...the ones you’ll be pretending to cheer for tomorrow?” But Agatha just blinks at her. Blank and clueless, making Rio laugh harder. “Wow. You really don’t know a single thing about baseball, do you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s exactly what I just said,” the Princess deadpans. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay, relax. No need to go full ice queen on me again,” Rio says, smirking. “I literally grew up on baseball. I used to wrestle the remote from my dad just to watch the games. I know them inside and out. You’ll be fine. Don’t worry, I’ve got you. I’ll walk you through the whole thing tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha eyes her suspiciously. “You’re going to make me suffer through it, aren’t you?” Rio’s response comes with a grin, and Agatha sighs, though there's a reluctant smile there. “Oh God help me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s kind of busy, baby,” Rio says before she even thinks about it, immediately realizing what she’s said. She clears her throat, trying to cover it up. “Uh, I mean, good thing you’ve got me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha also seems momentarily taken aback by Rio’s slip-up, but Rio can’t really tell because Agatha quickly schools her face into that neutral, composed expression she always wears. Without missing a beat, she stands up, brushing off the cold from the steps. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think I should head to bed,” she says. “Thanks for this, by the way. I mean, thank God for your dad and the Puerto Ricans. Who knew empanadas would make such a great midnight snack?” She smiles a little too brightly, flashing all her teeth. It’s the first time Rio’s seen her like that. And before Rio can be totally freaked out, the Princess adds, “I’ll see you tomorrow then? And please, kindly spare me the American tardiness. That’s not how it works when you’re with me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio opens her mouth to speak, but Agatha’s already turning away, heading up the stairs toward the door. “Why don’t you be a doll and say goodnight to Miss Vidal, Jimmy?” Agatha calls over her shoulder, not even sparing Rio a second glance as she walks past her security.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Goodnight, Miss Vidal,” the poor guy immediately complies, following the princess inside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Meanwhile, Rio is left standing there, staring after them, her eyes lingering on Agatha as she disappears inside. And as soon as the door clicks shut, she mutters under her breath. “Yeah, goodnight…Jim.”</span>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>When Rio enrolled at a small school in Wilmington, just ten minutes from their neighborhood in Elsmere, she had no clue a regular old high school baseball game would change everything for her. It was nothing special on paper. Just her school’s Red Wolves facing off against some boys from Sussex on a cloudless spring afternoon. But there was something in the way the game moved, the crack of the bat, the noise from the crowd, the way everything seemed to freeze right before a pitch, that flipped a switch inside her.</p><p>So, it wasn’t long before she picked up a bat herself in eighth grade, all awkward limbs and bruises as she stumbled through the basics. But the first time she actually managed to hit a home run, it made all the scrapes and bumps worth it.</p><p>She’d never stopped thanking her dad for the athletic genes after that, because her mom…well, her mom wouldn’t even run a 500-meter lap if her life depended on it. </p><p>And even though her dad had been a bit disappointed that Rio wasn’t as into football as he was, he was still all in. Carlos had come to terms with the fact that Rio wasn’t going to be his football prodigy, but that didn’t stop him from being her biggest fan.</p><p>And if you ask anyone in Wilmington who had the best swing back in 2010, chances are they’d say Rio. Or at least, she likes to think they would. She used to dream about going pro, picture herself in a real stadium, wearing a jersey with her name on the back, fans screaming as she stepped up to the plate, and the crack of the bat echoing as she knocked one out of the park.</p><p>But back then, things were a bit tight. Money was short, and her mom was just starting to make her way into Congress. Chasing that kind of dream wasn’t really on the table for Rio. So, she traded the field for medicine. And it was something she grew to love genuinely, something that made her proud. But the love for baseball also never wavered, the same as it had been when she was a kid.</p><p>Anyone can tell just by looking at her now, decked out in Dodgers gear from head to toe, sitting in the Terra with her eyes locked on the game between the Dodgers and the Nationals. It’s kind of ironic, considering the game’s on the Nationals’ home turf, right in Rio’s own backyard. But it’s also no secret that she’s always been a Dodgers fan.</p><p>Anyway, this is supposed to be just another game day. Rio being lost in the rhythm of the game, being caught up in the crowd’s energy: chanting, cheering, jumping along with everyone else. And, of course, Alice and the rest of her security detail are stationed around the box like always, keeping watch. Again, it’s really meant to be just like any other game day.</p><p>But then there’s Agatha, the actual Princess of fucking England, sitting right next to her. And suddenly, Rio’s not nearly as locked into the last inning as she should be. </p><p>Sure, it’s probably just polite for the Princess to look at her since she’s basically giving her a crash course in baseball: explaining fastballs, explaining why stealing a base is a big deal, and throwing out random trivia she’s sure Agatha couldn't care less about.</p><p>But it’s more than just that. The proximity is, quite frankly, getting to Rio. </p><p>She keeps catching the soft scent of lavender every time Agatha blends in with the cheers of the crowd, or turns to Jennifer on the other side, or leans toward Rio to ask something. And then there’s the way Agatha’s piercing blue eyes seem to focus just a little too intently on Rio, especially when she's pretending she doesn’t notice. It’s seriously messing with Rio’s concentration. At one point, she even wonders what the hell was in those empanadas last night?</p><p>Trying to shake it off, Rio hands over what’s definitely Agatha’s eighth hot dog. </p><p>“You know you’re averaging one every other inning, right?” she says, hoping the banter will pull her out of her head. “Funny thing is, I honestly didn’t think you’d turn into a Dodgers fan and a fan of hot dogs in the span of, what, two hours and a half of baseball?” </p><p>Agatha raises an eyebrow but grabs the hot dog nevertheless. “Oh, please. This is just me being naturally curious,” she says, half-smiling. She knows it’s a ridiculous excuse, especially after already having eight. “I honestly wasn’t expecting these to be anything like the Frankfurters back home. I mean, I have no clue what you lot even put in these, and I’m probably better off not knowing, but…” she takes a careful bite. “The relish and whatever else is in here is terrifyingly good.”</p><p>Rio turns, preparing to make some smart comment, when Jen leans forward from her seat beside Agatha. “You know,” she says, eyeing Rio. “I’ve been trying to get her to eat one of these for years. And now look at her, tearing through eight of them like she’s been American her whole life. You should be proud, Rio. You, of all people, got the Princess of dear old England to cave for an American hot dog. Feels like something that’s gonna end up in a weirdly specific Twitter thread one day.”</p><p>Rio chuckles, while Agatha, sitting between them, simply rolls her eyes. But before the Princess can say anything to Jen, Rio notices a dab of mustard on her top lip. “You've got a little something there,” Rio says, reaching up to wipe it away with a tissue without thinking.</p><p>It’s only a small, kind gesture. But when Rio notices Agatha freezing at the contact, she hastily takes her hand back, recognizing she may have crossed a line she did not want to.</p><p>“Sorry,” Rio mumbles, quickly turning away and scanning the throng to where the press might be lurking. She tells herself that it's probably just a harmless scene from anybody else's point of view, so why the hell does she feel so guilty all of a sudden?</p><p>“No, it’s fine. Thanks. I should probably stop eating anyway,” Agatha says, passing the rest of her hot dog to Billy, who’s sitting just behind them. </p><p>Rio attempts to focus back on the game, but she can’t just leave things hanging like that. So she turns to Agatha again. “But seriously, though. You’ve really never had an actual hot dog before? Not even once?” she asks, throwing a bit of humor into their awkward situation. She then follows up with a much more playful poke. “So what else have you been avoiding here? I’m betting there’s a whole list of stuff you’re secretly curious about.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t answer straight away, instead keeps looking at Rio. “You’d be surprised how long that list is,” she says, her eyes briefly, almost imperceptibly, straying to Rio’s lips. </p><p>But before Rio can even begin to unpack whatever that was, the crowd suddenly erupts. A surge of cheers sweeps over the whole stadium, with many standing, clapping, whistling, and some already spilling beer a few rows down. The lights appear to blaze hotter, and the excitement practically vibrates as the Dodgers secure their win. </p><p>Running on nothing but excitement and pure muscle memory, Rio throws her arms around the nearest person without a single coherent and sensible thought in her head. </p><p>A quick, tight embrace. Warm. Solid. And, oh god, definitely the Princess of England. </p><p>Rio freezes like a popsicle halfway through, exactly like Agatha did before, suddenly realizing she's wrapped around the latter, who appears equally stunned. </p><p>Another slip of judgment for America’s sweetheart, because what the heck was she even thinking? Touching the Princess like that, hugging her like they were fucking roommates. Why is her brain suddenly on vacation whenever Agatha’s around?</p><p>So, Rio does the only logical thing her probably one remaining brain cell can come up with: she swiftly spins to the other side and throws her arms around the old man standing next to her, shaking him like she’s trying to shake the picture of Agatha’s startled face out of her stupid, stupid head.</p><hr /><p>Rio would be lying if she says she isn’t still thinking about the game earlier, or more specifically, what happened that wasn’t exactly game-related, or what happened afterward – even as Lilia practically barges into her room, doing her usual check-in on how Agatha’s visit is going.</p><p>Most of Lilia’s rambling goes in one ear and out the other, but Rio catches some of the important bits, like the fact that her mom’s approval ratings have taken a noticeable jump over the weekend. “Honestly, I didn’t expect it, given everything, but your mother’s approval went up five points since the Princess showed up,” Rio learns from Lilia. </p><p>Rio argues that it’s probably because of the state dinner too, especially with all the foreign guests who attended. But Lilia counters that Rio’s own popularity rate is rising as well, partly because of how often she and Agatha have been seen together. Even Agatha’s approval rating in the UK is going up. Turns out, “the British public is loving the idea of their beloved Princess charming American crowds and rubbing elbows with the First Daughter,” as Lilia puts it.</p><p>Rio taps open her phone the second the Google alert buzzes through. Lilia and her band of White House image-polishers made her set it up. Something about staying ahead of the news cycle, especially with Isabel’s reelection breathing down their necks. “The sooner we read the tea leaves, the faster we turn the dirt into gold,” or some variation of that, is Lilia’s favorite crisis management mantra.</p><p>Rio sees her name trending again. And, naturally, Agatha’s too.</p><p>She scrolls, throwing the occasional nod or “mmhmm” toward her mom’s chief of staff to give the impression she’s still fully paying attention. </p><p>Most of the posts are about the game, packed into neat little carousels by sports outlets, gossip blogs, and a few overeager fan accounts. There’s one of Agatha taking a bite of a hot dog with an oddly poised expression, one of Rio cheering so hard her hat’s halfway off, and of course, the big one: the full-on hug after the Dodgers won. Mercifully for poor Rio’s dignity, and thanks to the paparazzi gods, the other deeply embarrassing moment didn’t make the cut. </p><p>But the internet really is a circus, Rio thinks, thumbing through the comments with a pit in her stomach and half a bag of chips slowly disappearing in her lap.</p><p>
  <em><strong> @fangirl1999</strong>: Besties of the century. I will not be taking questions. </em>
</p><p>
  <em><strong> @cryingin4k</strong>: They are literally my Roman Empire. I think about them hourly. </em>
</p><p>
  <em><strong> @plsjustkiss</strong>: Still no confirmation they’re dating??? </em>
</p><p>
  <em><strong> @mustardgate</strong>: Princess Agatha eating a hotdog like a normal person was not on my bingo card. </em>
</p><p>
  <em><strong> @theylookmarried</strong>: I didn’t even believe in love until this exact moment. </em>

  <em><strong> @dykemagnolia</strong>: They brushed shoulders and now I need a therapist. </em>
</p><p>
  <em><strong> @andimdooneese</strong>: If this is what friendship looks like, I owe my bestie an apology. </em>
</p><p>Rio groans and sinks deeper into the couch like it might do her a favor and swallow her whole. She feels like an idiot most days, sure, but right now, god this is peak idiot. </p><p>What the hell was she even thinking? </p><p>Oh, right. She wasn’t.</p><p>But as she keeps scrolling, something small and strange and warm, starts curling up somewhere in her chest. The photos actually look nice. Like, genuinely nice. Just two people who might actually like being around each other. And maybe, just maybe, Rio thinks, biting back a smile she doesn't fully understand, it wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world if her and Agatha being friends wasn’t just for show.</p><p>“So,” Lilia says, pacing like she always does when she’s half-distracted, half-thinking three things at once, “I guess that wraps up Her Royal Highness’ little visit. One last photo op tomorrow before she heads back to London, and you’re officially off princess-sitting duty. At least for a few months.”</p><p>She stops by the window, glancing over her tablet. “Honestly, I didn’t think you two would make it through the weekend without one of you snapping. And yet, shockingly, you didn’t try to strangle each other in public. I wish all your weekends went this smoothly.”</p><p>Rio just crosses her arm, too tired to even bother arguing.</p><p>Lilia gives her a quick once-over before heading toward the door. “Anyway, you look like you could use some sleep,” she says. “We can't have you showing up tomorrow with raccoon eyes. You’re gonna be front and center, and we both know that means you’ve gotta look at least semi-human when you’re standing next to the Princess.” She pauses at the door, offering one last glance before heading out. “Brush your teeth, get some rest. You’ve done enough for today. Sleep tight, kid.”</p><p>Rio has no idea what time she actually fell asleep following her quick conversation with Lilia. All she knows is that her phone won’t stop buzzing now, lighting up the room like it’s trying to rouse the dead. </p><p>Still half-asleep, she fumbles for her glasses, slips them on, and squints at the screen.</p><p>Her brows knit together when she sees who’s been texting her at four in the goddamn morning. She could’ve renamed the contact to “AH” or something, but weirdly, she kind of digs that stupid name.</p><p><b> <em>[2:59 AM] Arthur Hardass: </em> </b> <em> Now I know why I can't get any sleep here.

And either you’re a bit dense, or just lacking basic common sense. But the real issue is, I can’t sleep. How about a quick run? You do run, don’t you? </em></p><p>Rio pulls the blanket up to her chin, blinking at the ceiling. </p><p>A run? At this fucking hour? She shakes her head and taps another reply.</p><p><b> <em>[4:02 AM] Ralph Vines: </em> </b> <em> A run? Right now? Are you out of your mind? </em></p><p>Instantly, a GIF slides onto her screen: a cartoon princess in running shoes, huffing up a hill.</p><p>“I can’t believe you dragged me out of bed for this,” Rio yawns, jogging alongside Agatha. She glances over at her, whose hair is pulled back in a neat ponytail, wearing that signature St. Andrews sweatshirt.</p><p>Despite herself, Rio bites back a laugh. It’s hard not to when they probably look like the oddest pair from someone else’s point of view: Agatha, all polished and put-together, and her, wearing a Georgetown hoodie like she just rolled out of bed. Which, to be fair, she kind of did.</p><p>“And I can’t believe you brought me to an actual graveyard,” Agatha shoots back, her eyes scanning the eerie stillness of the cemetery. She briefly glances at their security detail lagging behind, probably doing their best to stay awake while silently regretting the whole thing. </p><p>It definitely wasn’t in Jimmy or Herb’s job description to trail two half-crazed women jogging through Capitol Hill’s Congressional Cemetery at four in the morning.</p><p>“I jog here whenever I feel like I don’t have to worry about someone snapping pictures of me,” Rio defends, quickly tying her hair into a messy bun while continuing to run. “There are no photographers hiding around who’d probably wonder what the hell we’re doing out here at this godforsaken hour.”</p><p>“Of course, there wouldn’t be. I mean, who in their right mind would be hiding around a bloody graveyard?” Agatha protests, then adds, “I always suspected you were a bit of a freak.” Rio hears her say it, but it doesn’t come off as an insult. The way she says the last part, almost fondly, gives it a different tone. Or maybe it’s just Rio’s imagination running wild again, with the early morning air and all.</p><p>“Hey, it’s your genius idea to go for a run,” she fires back. “And whatever, I like it here.” She gestures toward the different tombstones as they jog past. “It’s the one place I can unapologetically flaunt my life without worrying about being judged.”</p><p>Agatha suppresses a laugh, her lips curving into a smile as she catches the underlying meaning in Rio’s words. “See? All that charm, and there’s some freakiness lurking underneath.”</p><p>“And you’re simply a royal pain in the ass,” Rio says, then picks up her pace. She hears Agatha’s footsteps quicken too. Rio side-eyes her, speeding up, and Agatha follows suit. Rio huffs, stretching her stride even more. “What do you think you’re doing?”</p><p>“Making this more fun, obviously,” Agatha grins, pulling ahead just a little. Rio’s not about to let her win, though, so she digs in and pushes harder. Agatha glances back over her shoulder, still grinning. “How about a bet?” she calls. “First one to reach that cherry tree gets to make a dare. Loser has to do it.”</p><p>Before Rio can even blink, Agatha bolts forward in a sprint.</p><p>“Now, that’s not fair!” Rio yells after her, but Agatha’s already a few feet ahead.</p><p>“Life’s not fair, dearest!” Agatha yells back without even looking over her shoulder again. “Ask the dead!” She picks up the pace, and Rio finds herself grinning as well, even if she’s trying not to.</p><p>Not wanting to let Agatha win, Rio pushes herself even harder. There’s no way she’s losing, especially when she knows she’s the more athletic one. Agatha may be a polo player and an equestrian, but Rio couldn’t care less about those horse sports. She played baseball all through high school, running faster than girls twice her size, and throwing pitches that made grown men flinch.</p><p>She is not about to lose to Buckingham Barbie.</p><p>Right as they’re getting close to the tree, Rio kicks it into higher gear, totally ready to win. </p><p>She’s just behind Agatha and about to pass her – when the Princess suddenly dives forward out of nowhere, smacking the tree with her hand a split second before crashing onto the grass with a loud thud and an over-the-top “ow.”</p><p>Rio skids to a stop beside her, chest heaving. “What the hell, Agatha?” she blurts out, breathless and borderline panicked. The Princess is flat on her back in the grass, ponytail slipping loose, one knee scraped and already blooming red, but for some reason, she’s grinning. Really grinning. </p><p>And Rio was supposed to be the freak?</p><p>Herb and Jimmy rush over almost instantly, both looking like they just saw their careers flash before their eyes. But Agatha lifts a hand without even sitting up. “I’m fine. Really. It’s probably just a little scratch.”</p><p>The two agents trade a look but stay back. Rio huffs and offers a hand. “Seriously, what the hell were you thinking? You could’ve just let me win,” she says as Agatha takes it. Rio helps her sit up, then drops down beside her, still trying to catch her breath.</p><p>Agatha just laughs, brushing dirt off her sweatshirt. “I’ve dreamt of doing that for years.”</p><p>Rio gives her a look. “What? Scraping your knee?” she deadpans. </p><p>“No,” Agatha says, her grin dropping into something more knowing. “Running. Just <em> running.” </em> </p><p>Rio eventually picks up on what Agatha’s getting at, her eyes following hers as she stares off into the distance. And when she finally turns to look at her, Rio doesn’t look away. </p><p>“Do you think my eyes look sad?” Agatha asks. The question comes unexpectedly, and Rio’s not sure how to answer. Noticing the pause, Agatha continues, “Someone who painted my portrait once said there’s <em> something dark </em> about my eyes. ‘A touch of tragedy,’ he called it. Whatever that even means.” She laughs softly, almost like a kid, but Rio can tell there’s a bit of hurt behind it. “Do you think that’s true?”</p><p>Rio shifts, being acutely aware of how close they’re sitting. She takes a lengthy, thoughtful pause to take a look at Agatha’s face – to really study it. From the curve of her jaw, the faint bump on her nose, until the persistent tension in her brow. It’s then, looking into those blue eyes, that a random memory hits her.</p><p>It’s the summer after her mom won the presidency, her first trip to her dad’s hometown in Puerto Rico. The first time they'd been able to afford a real vacation, the first time they could actually visit the island, meet the family she’d only heard about in stories. </p><p>She remembers stepping onto the beach and just standing there, overwhelmed by how blue everything was. The ocean, the sky. It was all the same shade of unreal blue that made her feel something she still doesn’t really have words for. Agatha’s eyes kind of look like that. Bright, gentle, and warm.</p><p>But more than that, they remind Rio of how it felt being with her family. Those simple, effortless moments that felt like home without her even realizing it. So, she says –</p><p>“No,” sounding completely sure. “No, I don’t think your eyes are sad at all.” Agatha looks a little surprised by the answer. Rio stares down for a second, then looks back up. “Actually, I think they’re beautiful.”</p><p>They sit there in quiet for a second before Rio clears her throat. “Let me see the damage,” she says, looking away from Agatha’s face and scooting closer. Agatha still doesn’t say anything, just stretches out her leg a little. The scrape isn’t awful, but it looks like it stings. </p><p>Rio gently takes her leg and leans down, blowing on it the way her dad used to whenever she banged up her knees as a kid. When she looks back up again, Agatha’s already watching her, but whatever’s going on in her head, she’s not showing it.</p><p>So, Rio does what she always does when things feel a bit awkward. “Yeah, it’s just a tiny scratch, but we should probably head back and clean it up before it gets worse. Don’t want the Brits freaking out over their precious Princess scraping her knee on American soil,” she jokes.</p><p>Agatha only rolls her eyes as she takes Rio’s hand and allows herself to be hauled up. “Oh, God forbid,” she mutters, her sass coming back, before yanking her hand free and starting to walk forward. “Well, I may have scraped my knee, but you know what they say – glory never comes cheap.” </p><p>Rio, still catching her breath from the sprint, can't help but chuckle. “So, that whole jumping thing was really about winning that ridiculous bet? I seriously thought you were joking.”</p><p>“Unfortunately for you, I don’t take any type of competition lightly,” Agatha replies, sounding a little arrogant. “So yes, you owe me a dare.” </p><p>“Fine. What’s the dare then? You want me to run across the Capitol lawn? Order the weirdest drink at the nearest coffee shop? Post an embarrassing selfie on Instagram? Just say it, and let’s get this over with.”</p><p>Agatha pauses for a while before turning to face Rio with a cunning smirk. “No, those are far too basic, to say the least.” She takes another beat, then says, “I’ll tell you when I’m ready. Haven’t quite come up with something really good yet. For now, though, you can just enjoy the anticipation.”</p><p>Rio lifts an eyebrow, about to retort, but before she can, Agatha has the audacity to wink at her. “Come on, Jimmy,” she calls over her shoulder to the agent behind them. “We’re not sticking around with a loser.”</p><p>Oh, Rio still fucking hates Princess Agatha with all her heart. She’s loud about it, proud about it, and would probably fight anyone who dared suggest otherwise. </p><p>Or maybe <em> hate </em> is too strong a word, especially now that they’ve more or less buried the hatchet on their long-running, probably one-sided feud. So, Rio settles on <em> annoyance </em>. A deep, bone-deep sort of irritation that flares up every time Agatha opens her mouth or does something infuriatingly Agatha-ish.</p><p>Like now. Trotting off toward their car with that stupidly perfect posture, looking far too pleased with herself.</p><p>However, for reasons Rio stubbornly refuses to acknowledge and accept, there is now a peculiar feeling of fondness and maybe something dangerously close to some twisted sort of affection, quietly making its home deep underneath all that aggravation.</p>

  <p>
  <span>Rio knew she was gay long before she ever said the words out loud. Well, out loud to Alice and maybe three random and not-so-random other people, tops. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She’d known back in middle school, when a new girl with perfect pigtails walked into the cafeteria, and Rio couldn’t stop staring. She’d known it when the hot blonde cheerleader asked her for directions to Mrs. Davis’ class, and all Rio could do was nod like a malfunctioning bobblehead. She’d known it when she spent more time picking out a corsage for her brunette lab partner at prom than worrying about the guy she technically went with. She’d known it when she found herself daydreaming about kissing the redhead student assistant from the library instead of some guy behind the bleachers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio knew. But she didn’t really act on it until med school.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s first girlfriend, if she could even call her that, wasn’t anything official. More like casual hanging out and making out on their dorm room floor when they were both supposed to be studying. They weren’t exactly dating, not in any real way. Just orbiting each other for the better part of a year, give or take. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio couldn’t quite remember why it ended. Maybe it just fizzled out the way college things do. Or maybe it was when the girl dropped out of med school to pursue something completely different. Either way, it must’ve ended on decent terms, because they stayed friends after. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>After that, she only had a few random hookups. Some tipsy kisses with strangers at parties, some not-so-sober nights she never really thought twice about. Nothing serious. Nothing worth remembering.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But once her mom became president, that kind of stuff came to a full stop.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s not like she thought her parents would freak out. They’d probably be cool about it, no question there. But she wasn’t so sure the rest of the American public would be as kind. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>One crappy article from ages ago had already labeled her with “lesbian tendencies,” and even though barely anyone saw it, the comment section alone was enough to make her rethink putting anything personal out into the world.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So Rio did what any semi-closeted, politically adjacent twenty-something with a public spotlight and a functioning sense of self-preservation would do: she curated. Carefully. Strategically. Something no one told her to do but felt necessary anyway. She built herself a version of a public image that wouldn’t set fire to her mother’s career, but wouldn’t make her feel like a stranger in her own skin either.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She could be reckless at times, sure. But she knows how to play the game. How to shape a version of herself that the world could swallow without choking. So yes, she went on a few dates with a few very eligible dudes, well, dates in the very operated, headline-friendly manner. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Just a couple of ambassadors’ sons, a few tech bros, one Hollywood star, and a handful of D-list actors who either looked like they nearly landed the role of Luke Skywalker or could’ve been Theo James' less charming stunt double in Divergent. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Though if she’d had it her way, it would’ve been Portman or Woodley over either of them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But honestly, dating isn’t exactly high on Rio’s list of priorities right now. There’s barely time to breathe, let alone entertain the idea of romance. Between her mom’s looming reelection campaign, the upcoming National Christmas Tree Lighting, and her own infamous New Year’s Eve party – which, at this point, is practically a national holiday in DC – her plate’s full.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The country already knows Rio Vidal loves a good party and a strong drink. After all, “America’s Sweetheart” didn’t earn the title by sitting at home with a cup of chamomile tea. Every year, she packs the White House ballroom with a mix of friends, random celebrity faces, ex-flames, and the kind of ambitious twenty-somethings who look like they could either be influencers or future congresspeople. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But it’s actually less of a party and more of a carefully crafted spectacle that doubles as a fundraiser, pulling in so much money that Isabel couldn’t even deny the brilliance of it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So, if Rio can throw a killer rave and rake in donations for underfunded urban hospitals and schools in the same night, well, that’s just smart politics.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And lucky for her – and thanks to Princess Agatha’s recent weekend drop-in somehow nudging the President’s approval rating a few points north – the President has been, as Rio likes to put it, “in a surprisingly good mood” for five days straight. Good enough, in fact, that she hasn’t batted an eye at nearly every detail Rio’s pitched for this year’s edition.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Every plan in Rio’s head is already lining up perfectly: guest list, playlist, even the custom cocktails named after esoteric policy reforms. That is, until Isabel looks up from cutting her steak and says –</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ll be inviting the Princess too, I suppose? Considering how the public reacted to the two of you together, she’d be a valuable addition to that fundraiser of yours. Your guest list would practically be a parade of who's who. Right, mi amor?” She turns to Carlos, who, never one to swim against the current, just lifts his wine glass in easy agreement. “If you'd like, I can have Lilia take care of the formalities.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio, fork halfway to her mouth, deadpans, “Yeah, I seriously doubt that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Isabel sets down her knife and narrows her eyes at her daughter. “Okay,” she says, dragging the word out. “Would you please care to elaborate on what exactly you mean by that?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio looks between her parents and shrugs. “I don’t know, I just think she’s probably got way more important royal things to do than fly halfway across the world again, just for my stupid party.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stupid?” Isabel arches an eyebrow and looks over at her husband, who’s already fighting a smile. “This wouldn’t be the same party you just pitched as a ‘strategic opportunity to raise awareness and strengthen public support for a cause that aligns with our values,’ would it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio tries not to roll her eyes as her mom echoes her exact words, clearly enjoying the irony. Well, she may have inherited her dad’s athletic genes, but she definitely gets her sarcastic streak from her mom. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I mean, it probably seems like it’s the last thing she wants,” Rio retorts. “She was just here, what, a few days ago? Not to mention, she’s already booked for that other thing Lilia said is happening in a couple of months. I highly doubt the Princess is exactly itching to board another plane for New Year’s.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But how would you know if you haven’t even asked her?” her dad finally throws in from the other end of the table. “You won’t know unless you actually ask, mi niña.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And that puts a quick stop to Rio’s rebuttal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Because, if she was being honest with herself, she had been thinking about it. Perhaps she did want Agatha there. Perhaps she did want to see Agatha again. Or, for a more sensible reason, she was just dying to know if Agatha could handle dancing to American pop music.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So, with that perfectly sensible reason sitting pretty in her brain, Rio finds herself pulling out her phone as she settles into bed. She scrolls through her photos, her thumb pausing on the silly GIF she forced Eddie to make. Eddie being the rookie on her security team and, crucially, the only one who doesn’t immediately short-circuit at the mere mention of Photoshop.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s of Uncle Sam in very sparkly shorts, spinning around a pole, waving a half-empty wine bottle in one hand and throwing peace signs with the other. There’s also confetti and fireworks exploding everywhere, and a bold Comic Sans text at the bottom flashing: </span>
  <b>I want YOU to come party!</b>
</p><p>
  <span>A half-smile tugs at Rio’s lips as she quickly types out a message: “Apparently, it’d cause an international scandal if I don’t invite you. So, consider this your official summons to show up.” She then hits send and watches the message zip off. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio gets a reply the next morning while she’s on the treadmill, half-heartedly trying to break a sweat, listening to Robin Roberts in the middle of her usual warm, upbeat delivery across the TV in front of her.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>
    <em>Arthur Hardass:</em>
  </b>
  <em>
    <span> Will there also be a New Year’s cake? I’m not sure I trust you anywhere near it, considering the absurd amount of liquor that’s bound to be around.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio rolls her eyes and slows the treadmill, typing back quickly.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>
    <em>Ralph Vines: </em>
  </b>
  <em>
    <span>Oh, don’t worry. I’m not about to waste money on a cake that’s probably going to get destroyed in five minutes. And besides, rich people don’t eat carbs anyway. You’re safe.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>She taps out the next line, smirking as sweat clings to her brow.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>
    <em>Ralph Vines:</em>
  </b>
  <em>
    <span> Did I mention it’s a fundraiser? </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>She hits send, then types again. </span>
</p><p>
  <b>
    <em>Ralph Vines: </em>
  </b>
  <em>
    <span>Technically, I’m doing this for the greater good. Very noble of me, really.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio tosses her towel over her shoulder and steps off the treadmill. Her phone pings almost immediately.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>
    <em>Arthur Hardass: </em>
  </b>
  <em>
    <span>Whatever floats your boat, dearest. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio chuckles, shaking her head as she taps out another reply. </span>
</p><p>
  <b>
    <em>Ralph Vines:</em>
  </b>
  <em>
    <span> So, are you coming or not?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>A second later, her phone lights up again.</span>
</p><p>
  <b>
    <em>Arthur Hardass: </em>
  </b>
  <em>
    <span>I suppose I can make an appearance.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio can’t help but smile as she stares at the TV, until her smile drops the second Senator Ronald Grant flashes his smug face on screen. “What the hell is this moron doing on GMA?” She scrunches her nose, grabs the remote, and mutes the TV before heading for the shower.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The texting, however, did not slow down. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The messages and occasional phone calls keep coming for days as she tries not to trip over the mound of Christmas cheer that her dad is enthusiastically drowning the White House in. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And somewhere between debating which tree wouldn’t get blown over like last year’s lighting ceremony and negotiating the exact number of ornaments and guide wires needed, Rio finds herself continuously learning more about the Princess than she ever could from any interview or tabloid.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For instance, Rio learns that their birthdays are about two months apart, something curiously absent from the official fact sheets. It dawns on her that the Palace always seems more private when it comes to Agatha, especially compared to Prince Edward. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio can’t quite tell if that’s by Agatha’s choice or the Queen’s, but either way, she starts picking up on the quiet stuff. Like how Agatha doesn’t seem all that close to the Queen, not the way her brother is. Rio figures it’s probably because he’s the golden child, the heir, the one who gets the warmer headlines.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She also learns that Agatha hates prunes almost as much as Rio hates strawberries. She calls them “the devil’s raisins,” thanks to her mother’s relentless obsession with serving them for dessert when she was a kid. Safe to say, that left a pretty strong aversion.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then there’s the story about how Agatha once cried during a play at the Globe. She can’t even remember what it was about, probably Shakespeare, but she remembers her equerry at the time having to quietly escort her out because she just couldn’t stop crying.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“God forbid a royal gets caught feeling too much in public,” Rio had said, half-joking, half not.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio also learns that it was Agatha’s father who taught her how to ride a horse, a detail Agatha mentioned offhandedly when Rio brought up the scraped knee she’d gotten a few weeks ago. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He first bought me this ridiculous-looking pony. I named her Mrs. Wobbles because she had these huge ears, way too big for her head, a forelock so long she couldn’t see a thing, and she always looked like she was about to trip over herself. But somehow, I ended up loving her, even though she kept tossing me off and leaving me covered in bruises,” Agatha had said from the other end of the line.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mrs. Wobbles?” Rio had nearly choked on her water. “Do all royals give their pets the dumbest names on purpose, or is that just you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s not very nice of you, is it?” Agatha had shot back, dry as ever. “Well, forgive me for refusing to name her something dreary like Pookie or Starshine. I was five, not boring.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But what Agatha shared also reminded Rio of how her own dad taught her to ride a bike by pushing her down a hill. She hadn’t expected Agatha to laugh as hard as she did when Rio told her the story. The hill was small, barely a slope really, but the image of tiny Rio flying down it like a human cannonball is apparently comedy gold to the Princess.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And maybe it was dumb, but something about hearing Agatha genuinely laugh, especially after that tiny crack of sadness when she mentioned her father, left Rio feeling strangely pleased.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>The entire Ellipse goes quiet as Rio approaches the microphone. The first thing she notices is how cold the podium is. Or perhaps it’s just her fingers. Either way, she yanks off her gloves and stuffs them into her coat pocket. She squints at the bright lights, trying to see past the glare. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In front of her is a sea of people: kids on shoulders, cameras rolling, blinking Santa hats scattered everywhere. It’s a full-on holiday scene. Isabel and Carlos are standing behind her, along with a few other guests, all waiting for her cue to hit the giant glowing button that'll light up the National Christmas Tree.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In Rio's hand is a neat stack of cue cards, carefully written by her with a final check from Lilia, who stands off to the side of the stage. It’s usually the President’s role to deliver the speech, but this year, Isabel insisted on passing the baton to her. “Well, it's another opportunity for you to put all that talking to good use,” her mom had said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As she begins speaking, for whatever reason, her brain decides to drag her back to the Christmases of her childhood. She remembers how, no matter how hectic things got in Congress, her mom always made it home for Christmas Eve. Lilia would always show up too, carrying a tray of her famous homemade lasagna, an old Italian family recipe that Rio still tries (and fails) to replicate to this day.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then there’s the morning after, waking up to a few gifts under their little Christmas tree, even during the rough years when money was tight. Somehow, Isabel and Carlos always made it work, never letting little Rio stop believing in Santa Claus. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know the holidays mean a lot of different things to a lot of different people. For some, it’s a time for faith and reflection. For others, it’s about family, food, and those awkward reunions we all pretend we’re not dreading,” she says, and the crowd laughs. “And yes, maybe it also means way too much Mariah Carey.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another ripple of laughter travels through the crowd.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>However, halfway through her speech, Rio finds herself drifting again, not to her own memories this time, but to something Agatha had told her recently. About how, when she was a kid, her father used to sneak away from their big Christmas Eve parties just to tuck her in and read her a bedtime story. Usually something weird and magical, like flying witches or cookie thieves. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio actually laughed when she first heard that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha also shared that Christmas mornings were just as sweet. Her father used to take her and her brother to a small cabin near Sandringham, where they’d open presents like any normal kid. Even as Agatha got older, when it became just her and her father, sipping hot cocoa and sitting in silence with their books – celebrating Christmas morning at that cabin became a cherished tradition.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Until, of course, that tradition passed away with him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio looks out at the crowd, taking in the faces watching her. Slowly, she sets her cue cards down on the podium. Her hand rests there for a second, then she adjusts the mic and leans in. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But I also know that for some, the holidays aren’t all about cheer and celebration. For some, there’s a sense of guilt in celebrating. Because how can we truly be happy when we’re faced with the harsh truth that for so many, this time of year is anything but joyful? And sometimes, it just feels wrong to celebrate when there’s so much pain out there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s easy to say that these days are all about happiness, about peace, and about goodwill. But what happens when the pressure to be happy collides with the grief, the loneliness, and the fear that so many of us carry quietly every day? How do we balance the joy we’re expected to feel with the real, human struggles that don’t take a break just because the rest of the world tells us to celebrate?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio pauses, glancing over at her mom, who’s clearly a bit taken aback, but also a touch proud. It’s clear that this isn’t the usual upbeat speech Rio is known for.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I guess, I just want to say, in no uncertain terms, that it’s okay to feel this way. More than that, we need to make space for these feelings in our conversations because the holidays aren’t just about celebrating what we have, but also about recognizing the absence, the loss, and the problems that so many are facing, whether they be our neighbors, families, or ourselves.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Because as we light up this tree tonight, let’s remember that not all homes can turn their lights on. Not all families have a home to gather in. We must also recognize that, for so many, warmth is a luxury they don’t get to feel. So, let’s commit to more than just the celebration. Let’s commit to empathy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Because at the end of the day, the real light of Christmas isn’t in any tree. It’s in us. In what we choose to give, how we choose to care, and who we choose to stand beside.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Christmas morning shows up not with snow or carols or hot chocolate or cinnamon rolls, but with a buzz from Rio’s half-buried phone and a blurry photo of a medium-sized box, half-open, and sitting on royal carpeting. A grin immediately curls at her lips as soon as she sees who it’s from.</span>

</p><p>
  <span>Rio stares at it, trying not to burst out laughing. She waits. The three little dots keep showing up on her phone, like Agatha’s typing, but then disappears.</span>

  </em>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>Christmas break flies by, and Rio’s back in Georgetown, juggling a million things and ticking off items on her ever-growing checklist for her upcoming New Year’s party-slash-fundraiser. It’s as if the universe has decided she needs a new set of problems every five minutes. But thank god she’s a pro at multitasking, and knows how to prioritize, especially when it comes to a drink.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So here she is, tucked into the corner of a quiet little speakeasy, sipping a whiskey sour while half-reading some painfully dry piece on </span>
  <b>
    <em>how different countries are using soft power to subtly coerce their neighbors into international trade deals</em>
  </b>
  <span> – or something along those lines.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, this is something I didn’t expect to see out in the wild,” a voice says, just familiar enough to shake Rio out of her soft-power-and-trade-agreement stupor. She looks up from her book, eyebrows lifting before she schools her whole face into something a little less startled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Daffy,” she says after a second, the name just slipping out before she can stop herself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She glances over at the corner, where Alice is chilling with a drink in hand but clearly watching what’s going on. Rio gives her a quick look, still not totally sure she’s seeing this right. Alice looks a bit surprised too. Well, who wouldn’t be?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The other woman lets out a small laugh. “No one’s called me Daffy since med school.” Then, without waiting for an answer, she attempts to slide into the booth across from Rio. “Mind if I crash?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eddie, standing behind Alice, starts to move in quickly, but Alice stops her with a quick tap on the arm. She gives a subtle nod toward the newcomer, signaling that whoever this person is, she's fine to approach the President's daughter. A little too fine, really – especially considering her history with Rio.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure. Be my guest,” Rio says after another pause, nudging her book aside and gesturing toward the empty seat across from her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The other woman gives Rio a taunting, familiar look, which she returns with one of her own. “So, what’s up with America’s favorite Presidential daughter? Great speech at the lighting ceremony, by the way. Very moving. Our editors couldn’t get enough of it. You gave them a goldmine of inspiring quotes to work with.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Glad to know I made an impact,” Rio simply says, taking a sip of her drink.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, you always know how to,” the woman says, and Rio nearly chokes on her drink. She lets out another soft, almost amused laugh before adding, “And I have to say, you really flipped that whole cake fiasco into a win for your mom. Smooth move. You jetting off to London, and the Princess popping up here a few weeks later? Brilliant PR. Clean save, all around.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio huffs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Of course, Daphne Everhart, one of Washington's rising journalists, would bring that up. She always had a knack for pressing the right buttons, knowing exactly how to make Rio squirm. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio remembers those late-night dorm conversations, both of them half-dressed, half-drunk, sprawled across Rio’s bed. Daphne had talked about ditching med school to chase bylines, and said she wanted to be like her aunt, the award-winning political correspondent, Christine Everhart. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Apparently, she’d followed through.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s technically nepotism, sure, but the kind no one really complains about, because she’s actually good.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I had no idea you and the Princess were such close friends now,” Daphne says, lifting one eyebrow in amusement. Rio is well aware that the latter can see through any lies people tell about their appearance. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So, she humors her and smiles faintly. “That makes two of us, to be honest.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another look from Daphne, that same one that always meant trouble years ago, the one that told Rio she was about to push the boundaries only a little. “Would you mind if I go full reporter for a sec?” she asks, leaning in slightly. “Sitting here with you is honestly an opportunity I just can’t pass up.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Only if you’ve got one of those vintage press badges hidden somewhere,” Rio teases.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Daphne chuckles. “Don’t worry. I’ll make sure to wear it just for you next time,” she says with a wink. Then, of course, she eventually dives in. “So, we already know the recent polls are swinging your way, but is your mom’s camp starting to sweat, even just a little, about reelection?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio lets out a dry laugh. “Oh, sweetheart, the only ones that should be sweating are Grant’s balls, and whatever outdated, bigoted mess he's planning to shove down the country’s throat next.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Daphne instantly barks a laugh, loud enough to draw a glance from the next table. “See, that’s the kind of line that makes editors foam at the mouth. You’ve got gold just spilling out of your mouth, Vidal. You should definitely let me quote you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Absolutely not.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Daphne pouts. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, come on! Not even if I say it came from a ‘source close to the White House’? I swear, they’d never know it’s from you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio shakes her head, smiling as she clicks her tongue against the side of her mouth. “Nope. That’s a flat-out no,” she says, crossing her arms. “That quote gets out, and I’m probably packing up my room at the White House the next morning.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“God, when did you get so boring?” Daphne groans, though there’s something else behind it. Then she goes quiet for a second, their eyes intensely locking again. “You know,” she says more softly, reaching for Rio’s fingers on top of the table, “we should really hang out sometime. Off the record, of course. Just you and me. Like we used to. That’d be fun, don’t you think?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio hesitates, her eyes moving across to Alice, who’s practically eavesdropping, before she pulls her fingers back. “Yeah, well…Georgetown’s kind of kicking my ass right now,” she says, motioning to the mess of papers and her half-read textbook. “And with the reelection coming up, things are a little hectic.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Daphne nods, like she was expecting that answer. “Of course, busy as ever. Always chasing something. Classic Rio Vidal running at full speed.” She pauses just long enough for Rio to fidget a little. “It’s part of your charm, though. That – and those ridiculously distracting eyes of yours.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio opens her mouth, then closes it again, unsure what to say.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Daphne seems to catch it and, thankfully, slides out of the booth. “Anyway. I should let you get back to whatever this is.” She gestures toward the chaotic spread of papers. “It was good seeing you, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah. You too,” she replies, subtly letting out a breath she didn’t realize she was holding.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio watches Daphne disappear through the door, and just then, Alice, her ever-teasing security detail, catches her eye. Alice dramatically fans herself, as if the whole interaction had been some kind of a sizzling spectacle, clearly enjoying it way more than Rio does. The latter only rolls her eyes, flicks her hand dismissively, and turns back to her book.</span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>It only takes a photo of Agatha wearing that shitty Mrs. Wobbles shirt Rio made, paired with plaid pajamas, for one of their occasional late-night calls to get started again – if describing it as ‘occasional’ still counts when it happens almost every other day now. Rio insists it does.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She always says the calls are more practical. She has zero patience for texting for hours and prefers talking while multitasking. Except, tonight, she’s not doing anything except lying across her bed, staring at the ceiling, and listening to Agatha on speakerphone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Or more like, listening to the background noise. The thumping and rustling can only mean one thing, Rio figures: Señor Scratchy is around. And every time Agatha puts her on speaker, the noise only gets louder. It’s like the little bunny knows it’s Rio on the other end, and honestly, it’s starting to feel like he has a personal grudge against her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I'm honestly starting to think he just doesn't like me,” Rio says. She can almost picture Agatha in her own room, across the Atlantic, probably lying in bed in the exact same position.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, well, he’s incredibly rude,” Agatha tells her flatly, her voice going muffled for a sec as she scoops Scratchy up. “Takes after me, apparently.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Clearly,” Rio teases. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Or maybe he just doesn’t trust Americans.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio laughs. “Well, I’ll win him over eventually. With my charm. Or bribery. Whichever works.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re gonna need a miracle,” Agatha says, and Rio can still hear the rustling. “Or, like, a very big veggie tray. He’s weirdly obsessed with kale. Might be why he actually tolerates Jen.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A few more rustles, then the noise shifts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you watching something?” Rio asks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Agatha replies. “Scratchy and I are watching Fleabag. Why?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nothing,” Rio replies. “It just didn’t occur to me that the royal family watches television.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I’m sorry to shatter your fragile perception of the monarchy,” Agatha deadpans.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio snorts, shifting under the covers, hearing Agatha do the same on her end. “You’re a lot more human than I give you credit for,” she says, then pivots, “But do you ever actually sleep? I'm really starting to suspect otherwise.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As a matter of fact, I do,” Agatha replies. “Usually after two melatonin gummies, along with the crushing and unbearable weight of royal responsibility,” her natural British wit sneaking through.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio chuckles, staring up at the ceiling. “You should really put that on your next souvenir mug.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, don’t you dare give me ideas,” she deadpans though Rio can hear a smile in her voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Speaking of dares, you still haven’t told me what mine is. Or maybe you’ve just conveniently forgotten,” she draws out the words. Then, with a sigh, she adds, “And shit, now I’m starting to regret even bringing it up, because maybe you actually have.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s soft laugh rings over the phone. “No, I haven’t conveniently forgotten,” she says. “I just like to take my time with these things. After all, a royal dare should be nothing less than perfect. Maybe, by the time I get back, I’ll have something fitting for you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio rolls her eyes, even though Agatha can’t see it. “That’s really not reassuring.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha lets out a full laugh now. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, trust me, I’m not that cruel. I wouldn’t dare you to do something like running and stripping through a crowded street,” she pauses. “Or maybe I would, if I start getting really, really bored.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio stammers, “Jesus, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Only you would say ‘Jesus’ after I mention running and stripping,” Agatha quips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio snickers, and Agatha follows with a quieter chuckle. Then comes the familiar rustling on Agatha’s end again, “Even Señor Scratchy thinks you’re a menace,” Rio mutters, shifting onto her side.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She can hear Agatha doing the same thing. A subtle creak of the bed over the phone.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And maybe it’s the late hour, or the two sneaky glasses of champagne she grabbed from the kitchen before bed, but Rio finds herself picturing it: Agatha lying right across from her, both of them facing each other, phones forgotten somewhere between the pillows. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She’s definitely not about to say that out loud – God, no – but it’s hard to shake that thought now. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maybe it’s time she considers giving up late-night drinking. Or, hell, just drinking in general.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m hanging up now,” Agatha says suddenly, a soft yawn slipping out as she speaks. Rio looks at the clock and realizes they’ve been talking for over an hour. “I think I’ve had enough of your endless yapping.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio snorts, brushing the thought aside. “For the record, I usually get paid to yap. So really, you should feel lucky you’re getting this for free. And I’m the one hanging up on you, not the other way around.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha yawns again. “Fine. Whatever tickles your fancy.” She pauses for a second, and Rio just stares at the spot where she pictures Agatha being. After another beat, the Princess adds with a smirk in her voice, “This is where you actually hang up, by the way. That’s what the big red button’s for, in case you forgot.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Glancing at her phone on the bedside table, Rio chuckles. She almost wants to slap herself for how much she's laughing during this conversation. She thinks of a snarky remark to cover up that feeling but ultimately settles for, “Guess I’ll see you in a few days.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oh Jesus fucking Christ. She absolutely, unequivocally, desperately should quit drinking. </span>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>The guests start rolling in around nine, and not long after, the drinks are flowing as if someone opened the floodgates. The music’s loud. Like, really, really loud, the ballroom’s practically vibrating like someone’s second heartbeat. Neon lights are flashing everywhere, painting the whole place in wild colors, and the DJ’s not holding back. No slow jams. Just beat after beat after beat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The first to trickle in are always the same breed: the eagerly ambitious White House interns, and the latest crop of political heirs. Next comes the crowd handpicked by Lilia’s office: a mix of young lobbyists, high-powered attorneys, strategists, and those who know exactly how to smile while sliding a business card your way. Finally, there’s the late crowd, or the party promoters who think they’re the life of it: the fashionably late pop stars, teen actors from shows no one admits to watching, celebrity kids who treat nepotism like a VIP pass, and the trust fund babies this fundraiser fully intends to milk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio, against her better judgment, figures she might as well get into the party mood like everyone else, and orders herself a mezcal margarita. However, it barely grazes her lips when Alice shows up beside her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>At this point, Rio’s almost convinced her best friend-slash-head of security has some kind of built-in bat signal that somehow activates the moment she picks up a glass at any party.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Echo Six, this is Alpha Two,” she hears Alice mutter into her comms. “Keep eyes on River. I repeat, keep eyes on River. Just a friendly heads-up. Over.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before Rio can even get a word in, a voice – one she’s quite sure is Eddie’s, with that annoyingly chipper charm – crackles through the speaker, “Copy that. Eyes on River. She’s in my sights. Over.” And as if summoned by sarcasm, Rio spots him by the bar, casually posted up next to Herb. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alice finally turns to said </span>
  <em>
    <span>River</span>
  </em>
  <span>, who, for her part, doesn’t even pretend not to roll her seemingly beguiling brown eyes. “You might want to pace yourself,” Alice points out, like she hasn’t said it a thousand times before. “You’re still technically hosting this thing.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio places a hand on her chest, faux-wounded and debates, “Jesus, Gulliver. I’m barely one sip in. Trust me, table-dancing is at least five or six cocktails away.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You said those exact words three fundraisers ago,” Alice argues, not even blinking. “Five minutes before your third margarita. If I remember correctly.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio snorts and takes a stubborn sip. “It was basically a press-free party,” she says, then pauses, recalling a few fuzzy photos that did slip out. “Well…sort of. But same deal as this one, more or less. So there’s really no need to go full babysitter mode and rob yourself of a good time.” She grimaces slightly at the taste, her eyes scanning the crowd over the rim of her glass.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She takes another sip and glances back at Alice. “By the way,” she drawls, stretching the word out. “Has everyone shown up yet, or are we still waiting for the usual stragglers?” Her eyes sails back to the entrance, though she makes an effort not to look too obvious about it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Because she’s not exactly searching for anyone in particular. Of course not. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Definitely not for someone who might have just crossed the Atlantic in a royal jet to grace her with their presence tonight. Certainly not for someone who just so happens to hold the title of Princess and had looked inexplicably good in a Dutch white pantsuit and glossy dark brown hair, featured on the cover of Vogue that Rio had seen just this morning.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But before she can sink any deeper into her totally-not-Princess-of-England-related thoughts, a voice suddenly cuts through the party noise, all loud and smug. “Ah, there she is! The woman of the hour. The hostess with the mostest. Been looking for you, sunshine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>An arm drapes over Rio’s shoulders like it’s done it a hundred times before (because it has), and she doesn’t even bother shrugging it off. Doesn’t need to turn around either. Because there’s only one person on the planet who calls her sunshine. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oliver,” Rio says, flat as a pancake.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The grin that steps right into her line of sight belongs to Oliver Hansen. All teeth and cheekbones and that over-the-top kind of confidence only people with childhood acting careers had developed naturally.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ve been on more front pages than I care to count, sweetie,” he says. “The least you could do is fake a little glee about seeing me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And, well, he’s not wrong. They did make the rounds in a few tabloids. Mostly blurry photos of them stumbling out of dive bars at god-awful hours. Rio can practically imagine the old headlines flashing before her eyes as she looks at him now. </span>

  <span>Rio eventually allows a genuine smile to slip in. “Glad you could make it.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sunshine, please,” Oliver scoffs, tapping her glass with his own. “I wouldn’t miss your grand soirée for anything,” he says with a knowing pause, then adds, “Besides, I hear a couple of tabloids could really use some desperate help finding fresh material.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oliver gives her an almost pleading look, and Rio understands without him saying a word. She doesn’t need the explanation. She’s seen it too many times before. Oliver’s here for the same reason he always is: to dodge another round of so-called rumors about his sexuality. He’s come to her for help, because who else but the President’s daughter, who already knows him, can provide the perfect smokescreen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, if I’m being honest, I don’t really have anyone in mind for my midnight kiss yet,” Rio tells him. She watches as Oliver visibly holds himself back from pulling her into a hug, as if the gesture might break something open if he lets himself follow through.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now that’s mighty convenient, isn’t it?” he adds, loud and almost theatrical, like he always does in public. But then he leans in close so only Rio can hear. “Thank you, really. Steve and I owe you one.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio can’t help but smile at the mention of Oliver’s boyfriend. She’s seen the two of them together before, behind closed doors, in the comfort of Oliver’s New York brownstone: making dinner, and brushing past each other like they couldn’t help but be close.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She hasn’t seen many couples like them. It almost seems unreal, how in sync they are, and just how stupidly in love they seem. The kind of love that doesn’t have to perform for anyone else.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And it kind of breaks her heart.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Because out here, none of that is allowed to exist. And it’s a shame that someone like Oliver has to bury something that beautiful just to keep his career intact. Rio had watched him struggle with it, always playing the charming, straight guy with a pretty girl on his arm and a fake smile that sells movie tickets. But never getting to be the man who simply wants to hold the hand of the man he loves in public without the fear of being judged.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And Rio, who’s mastered the art of hiding her own truths, feels a discomfort in her chest that she can't quite describe. She can’t imagine living like that, loving like that, and being trapped in the shadows.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She’s never known a love so raw, so all-consuming. And maybe, just maybe, there’s a part of her that’s relieved. Because if she’s being honest with herself, she doesn't know if she could even survive it.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“New arrival at the perimeter. All units stand by for clearance.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio gets pulled back to the moment when Alice’s comms crackle, and a voice, unmistakably Agent Hill’s, comes through loud and clear. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Ember</span>
  </em>
  <span>’s at the northeast entrance. Standby for secure entry,” she announces, and Rio’s eyes are caught by a splash of vibrant color that turns out to be Jen's shiny silk dress, bursting with a wild mess of pinks and reds, and bold, almost abstract patterns. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But with a subtle shift to her left, the vibrant color of Jen’s fit fades into something far more subdued. There, standing in a sleek black fit-and-flare, is Agatha. Her smile, usually reserved, curves into something warmer as her blue eyes meet Rio’s.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re late,” is all Rio manages to say once Agatha’s close enough to hear her over the music. If she weren’t so caught up in how Agatha looks, she might’ve cracked a joke about showing up dressed for a funeral, except all Rio can think is how unfair it is for someone to look that good in black. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Or maybe it’s just the lighting. Rio did spend a good amount of time picking it out for the party, after all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Am I?” Agatha replies. “I’d argue the party simply started early.” And there’s something about the way she looks at Rio that isn’t exactly what Rio remembers. Like standing too long in the sun, the heat almost overwhelming and a little too warm, yet you still soak in it because it just feels too good to pull away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Or maybe Rio’s just drunk. It wouldn’t be the first time she felt tipsy after one margarita. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>That did happen once. Or twice. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your Highness, what a pleasure,” Oliver says, stepping forward with a smile that looks like it’s been practiced in at least a dozen mirrors. He gives the Princess a polite nod, cutting clean through Rio’s train of thought. “We were both at that same charity art event in Salisbury last year. I didn’t get the chance to introduce myself properly, so I wouldn’t blame you if you’ve erased it from memory by now.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha gives a slow blink. She clearly doesn’t remember.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can I just say, you’re exactly how you come across in photos,” Oliver goes on, hands casually tucked in his pockets. “Only a little more intimidating in person.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio studies Agatha, who has an inscrutable look on her face. Though, it’s probably just Oliver’s complete lack of boundaries at play. Or maybe it’s just Oliver being Oliver. Sometimes, he has this way of being overly friendly and way too honest, but that’s kind of what makes him...well, him, Rio figures.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is that meant to be a compliment?” asks Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, one hundred percent. You’re as striking in person as you are in all those headlines and poorly lit paparazzi shots. Which, frankly, is quite impressive. Cameras don’t usually do anyone favors these days. I should know.” He flashes the kind of smile you’d expect from someone who once auditioned to play one of the Kens in Gerwig's Barbie and actually got a callback.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jen, standing next to the Princess, leans forward and throws in. “Now, if that’s your way of asking for a selfie, you’re going about it all wrong.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oliver chuckles, evidently having a good time. “And you must be Ms. Jennifer Kale,” he says, turning toward her with a bit too much energy. “Florida’s own powerhouse in heels. I read about you in Forbes’ 30 Under 30. It’s nice to finally meet you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jen quirks an eyebrow. “Well, now I’m flattered. I didn’t think my heels were that powerful,” she says, “Though, I wouldn’t mind if the title came with a few less press releases. Makes sneaking out of parties and causing a little trouble a lot harder.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oliver laughs again, and Rio can’t help but think how actors really have a knack for people-pleasing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Or perhaps it’s just a side effect of the job. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Speaking of trouble,” he says, giving that signature smile of his again. “How about we make some ourselves? A couple of drinks to kick things off, then maybe a few spins on the dance floor?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He holds out his hand, looking at Jen expectantly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sounds like a plan,” she says, shooting a quick look at both Agatha and Rio before allowing herself to be pulled into the throng.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio watches as they get swallowed by the crowd, Oliver already spinning Jen halfway across the floor. She then turns to notice how Agatha’s smile changes slightly as she watches them too, and suddenly, Rio finally understands their dynamic. When Agatha wants to stay out of the spotlight, it’s a friend like Jen who steps in and takes it all for her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not that I’m keeping score or anything,” Rio says, bumping her gently, “but I’m already one drink in. So unless you plan on letting me win that easily, you’ve got some catching up to do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>More than one conversation dies out as Rio and Agatha pass by, necks craning and eyes following them like they’ve just walked through in slow motion. Rio can almost see them from other people’s points of view: the British Princess and the President’s daughter, cutting through the crowd like a Vogue spread come to life. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The picture looks untouchable. Powerful, even.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maybe a little intimidating.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Almost unreal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But that's what everyone else sees. No one out here knows about Mrs. Wobbles, or the time little Rio flew down a hill like a human cannonball. Only the two of them know that. That’s just theirs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio snags their first drinks and lets the crowd sweep them up like the tide. A few drinks in, and she finds herself weirdly happy with how Agatha looks beside her. Somehow she manages to appear both intimidating and completely out of place, like a fragile museum piece placed in the middle of a nightclub.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Rio introduces Agatha to a couple of White House interns and fresh-faced political heirs, she watches them blush while Agatha keeps that signature polite smile. Rio barely holds back a laugh every time someone stammers in front of the Princess, and she notices Agatha’s effort to keep that smile from slipping into a grimace.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then there’s more dancing. More mingling. More drinks. A short speech from Rio about the schools and hospitals they’re raising money for, and surprisingly, Agatha seems to be actually having a good time, like really, really enjoying herself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At some point, Jen eventually finds them, pulling Agatha away to chat at the bar with a new crew of celebs she’s picked up. Rio recognizes one of them as that actress from that one mind-blowing Black Mirror episode she can’t quite remember the title of. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She watches them disappear into the crowd, and just like that, she’s caught up in it too.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Time passes, and Rio finds herself on the dance floor, moving to the pulse of 2000s pop hits. The kind of songs that pull up memories of long-forgotten crushes, awkward high school dances, and the sight of sweaty teenagers grinding on each other all around.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That’s when her eyes land on Agatha again, standing at the bar by herself, like a delicate hibiscus lost in a landscape of loud music and mayhem.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I haven’t seen you dance yet. Why aren’t you dancing?” Rio asks, watching Agatha stand there awkwardly, visibly unsure of what to do with her hands or even her feet. It’s endearing, Rio thinks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Or perhaps it’s just her fourth margarita doing the thinking.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The royal family’s dance lessons didn’t exactly cover this,” Agatha points out, gesturing vaguely toward the jumbled swirl of bodies on the dance floor. “They taught us the waltz and the foxtrot, but nothing about whatever this...whatever this is.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio can’t help but laugh, her margarita-addled brain finding the person in front of her even more charming. “Well, that’s bullshit,” she says. “Come on. It’s all in the hips. You just have to loosen up a bit.” She steps closer, hands finding Agatha’s waist, who stiffens instantly at the touch.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s the opposite of loose, Your Highness,” Rio adds.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I really don’t think this is a good idea.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on. It’s easy. Just watch me,” she says, already swaying to the beat of a Beyoncé song that’s blasting from the speakers. Agatha takes a long look at her before answering.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am watching.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before Rio can overthink that look, the song switches to one of those classic middle-school jams that still top the charts every now and then. The kind where everyone tries to act mature but ends up dry humping to the beat like they’re at a freaking school dance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The crowd immediately loses their shit. People start jumping, and a few even start howling like total maniacs. Jen’s on someone’s shoulders, grinning like she’s on top of the world, while Oliver’s got a congressman’s niece spun out in his arms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now you really, really have to dance!” Rio shouts, grabbing Agatha’s hand. The Princess tries to protest, something about dignity and this being absolutely undignified, but Rio’s already dragging her toward the center of the dance floor. “Being a princess doesn’t get you out of this. This is basically an American rite of passage, and you’re doing it with me!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The smile on Rio’s face couldn’t possibly stretch any wider as she watches Agatha standing stiff as a statue in the middle of what now looks like a zoo disguised as a dance floor. Bodies are shimmying, people are yelling, and someone’s already doing the worm in a corner.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio, on the other hand, just rolls with it. She grabs two shots from a passing tray, downs them like water, and starts moving with the rest of the crowd. Somewhere in the chaos, she glances back and catches Agatha just watching her. There’s a tiny smile playing on her lips. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I bet this is the best party you’ve ever been to,” Rio yells, trying to be heard over the music.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It is,” Agatha replies. “I absolutely adore large parties. They’re so very…intimate,” she quips, looking around at the swarm of people, not even trying to hide the sarcasm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio bursts out laughing. Her brain tries to blame the margarita. Definitely the margarita. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>From there, the night just keeps getting louder, wilder, and messier. There is no doubt the White House press team’s gonna have a field day sifting through the photos after this: Celebrities, mostly the ones with Oscars, are out here dancing on tables, young politicians screaming lyrics at the top of their lungs, and somehow, God knows how, confetti starts falling from the ceiling. Rio’s pretty sure she never approved confetti, but here it is, everywhere. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The drinks keep coming: shots that burn, kaleidoscopic cocktails with tiny umbrellas, something fizzy and pink, and a bright blue drink that tastes like pure sugar. At one point, Rio also finds herself on top of a table, dancing with her arms above her head. She spots Alice’s horrified face in the distance, but when she looks at Agatha, the Princess is laughing. Really laughing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She watches Agatha grab a whole Dom Pérignon, and takes a long swig straight from the bottle. Rio somehow freezes for a second, unceremoniously hyper-aware of how Agatha grips its neck, how her fingers wrap around it, how her lips press against it. It’s a little too hot, and suddenly, Rio feels a warmth spreading in places she wasn’t prepared for.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So Rio grabs another shot and keeps dancing. Agatha’s moves are still a bit stiff, but Rio can tell she’s trying, at least bobbing her head to the beat. Rio’s hands keep finding their way to her, guiding her through it, and the purr from the alcohol only gets stronger every time Agatha stares at her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>After a while, they’re not even really dancing anymore. They're just standing there, the music blasting around them, the room spinning a little, and the two of them locking eyes and smiling. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio doesn’t know what any of it means, and honestly, she’s too drunk to think about it now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At 11:59, the DJ calls out the countdown and everyone huddles together at the center. Eyes glassy, arms slung around each other like a slew of intoxicated puppies. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The entire room shouts in unison: “Five! Four! Three! Two! One!” Oliver’s practically yelling into Rio’s ear, breath reeking of whiskey, and the second the clock hits midnight, he swings an arm around her waist as Rio loops hers around his neck just as easily. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then he kisses her, sloppy and messy, with both of them literally laughing through it. They’ve done this a dozen times for the cameras, for the headlines. And every single time, it has felt like the same thing: harmless, completely unromantic, and simply empty. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Honestly, Rio can’t even remember the last time a kiss actually meant something. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>If she really thought about it, maybe the only one that ever kind of did (special emphasis on kind of did) was her very first kiss with a girl. She’d been thirteen, nervous as hell. And even then, she couldn’t tell if it were butterflies or just the sheer panic of screwing it up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oliver’s mouth tastes like sugar and whiskey and something weirdly herbal. She pulls back, scrunching her nose. “Jesus, how many whiskey sours have you had?” He just laughs, and so does she. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Rio turns around, Agatha is already watching her. Standing perfectly still at the center, like the eye of a storm. Rio had never seen something so inscrutable in her expression before. It’s not cold exactly, just…guarded. Like whatever she’s thinking is locked tight behind her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s smile stretches a little wider, hoping maybe it’ll make the Princess crack one too. But Agatha doesn’t. She only keeps Rio's eyes for a bit longer before looking away, and then, without a word, slips into the crowd and disappears.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio tries to call after her but her voice gets swallowed by the noise. And then she kind of forgets what she was doing in the first place. The room starts tilting slightly, or maybe that’s just her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Either way, she’s definitely drunk. Drunker than she was at last year’s New Year’s party when she tried to race Herb in her stilettos. The crowd pulls her in again. People bump into her, someone hands her another drink she definitely doesn’t need, and she just rolls with it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She laughs at stuff she doesn’t really catch, ends up dancing with some girl who she swears was on a dating show once. Oliver shows up again just to disappear a second later, off to annoy someone else.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s always had a sweet spot for nights like this. Where the music's literally pulsing in her bones, the booze's warm in her blood, there’s confetti stuck in her hair, and glitter sticking on her collarbone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nights loud enough to drown out the overthinking, the politics, the pressure of always being watched. Tonight, she’s simply another body in a sea of people that's just having too much fun.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But even in the middle of it all, Rio can't overlook the fact that Agatha is suddenly nowhere to be found. She looks about, checking the dance floor again, the bars, the restrooms, and even the darker nooks of the ballroom. But there is not a trace of the Princess anywhere. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She yells her name above the din, hoping to grab Jen’s attention, but all she gets is a drunken shrug as Jen swipes another shot off the passing tray. Oh, the Florida heiress is far gone tonight, Rio figures.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio wouldn’t admit it, but she starts to feel a little...concerned. Alright, maybe not concerned. More like distracted. Or perhaps mildly intrigued. Yes, intrigued sounds better. Intrigued by where the hell the Princess wandered off to. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The White House really doesn’t need another international scandal, especially one involving America’s richest. If there would be a scandal coming out of this, there might not be another party like this next year, and that would suck, especially since Rio did raise a ton of donations tonight.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So, she keeps looking around, even though her head’s spinning and her breath smells like guilty conscience and margarita. At one point, she even earnestly asks a giant ficus where Agatha went, mistaking it for a waiter, before tripping over her own feet near one of the big hallway windows. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She catches herself, barely, and that’s when her eyes magically land outside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And there, in the snowy stretch of Kennedy Garden, is Agatha. Sitting alone on a bench under the row of big Linden trees Rio always liked to read beneath. She frowns. Where the hell is Agatha’s security? There is no way they just forgot about her. Or maybe they’re just as drunk as Rio is.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio somehow slips out the side door without really thinking about it, and definitely without anyone noticing. The second it clicks shut behind her, the music cuts off like someone yanked the aux. All that’s left is quiet. Snow-muffled, winter-night quiet. Just her, the cold, and Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And from where she’s standing, Agatha doesn’t even look drunk. Or maybe she’s just too stubborn and too proper to let alcohol get a grip on her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio tries to step closer, but ends up misjudging a decorative bush and half-tripping through it. The noise makes Agatha turn her way. When she does, the moonlight hits her perfectly, and for a second, Rio forgets how to think straight. They lock eyes, and everything goes kind of tunnel-vision for her, and for another second, Rio forgets how to walk straight, too.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tomorrow’s hangover is gonna be brutal. She’s sure of that. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you doing out here?” Rio asks, walking up and sitting next to her under the tree. She shivers slightly from the cold, but Agatha doesn’t seem bothered at all. Either she’s too proud to show it, or maybe she really isn’t beating the Princess Elsa allegations. “Guess you’ve really had enough of the normal crowd inside to end up out here, butt off in the cold. Aren’t you freezing?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio takes a quick look at her, noticing that, between the two of them, she’s the only one wearing a blazer, well, technically it’s Oliver’s blazer, which she doesn’t even remember how she ended up with.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I'm not,” Agatha mumbles, though the small puff of cold air that comes out of her mouth says otherwise. Rio almost offers her blazer but stops, thinking she might be invading Agatha’s personal space. “And I should be asking you the same. Doesn’t America’s sweetheart have a crowd inside to charm?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If we’re talking about charming people, we definitely shouldn't be talking about me,” Rio argues. “Half the room was practically swooning over you back there.” She scoots a little closer, hoping maybe some of her body heat might reach the very cold, and very stubborn Princess beside her.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Agatha doesn’t say a word, just keeps staring ahead like she’s seeing something only she can see. Rio notices she does this every time she’s lost in her thoughts, like she’s somewhere else entirely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You still haven’t answered my question,” Rio presses, “I thought you were actually having fun in there. Or is spending that much time with commoners really that intolerable for you?” she teases. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>However, Agatha just rolls her eyes. “You can’t ever just let things be, can you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio keeps watching her. Normally, there's a hint of softness in the way Agatha holds her mouth, something that suggests she’s not completely closed off. But right now, her lips are tight, almost like they’re trying to seal something. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She clearly doesn’t have a clue what’s going on in Agatha’s head, but some part of hers, probably the part soaked in margaritas, thinks maybe it’d help if she nudged her shoulder slightly against Agatha’s. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It's me, isn't it? Did I do something wrong? Was it something I said?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Something passes over Agatha’s face, but she doesn’t say anything. Rio wonders if she indeed crossed a line, but she really can’t quite figure out where. Did she go too far with a joke? But which one?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, Agatha shifts a little, letting out a deep breath before speaking. “Do you ever wonder what it’s like to just be some anonymous person out in the world?” her eyes still drifting over to the South Lawn.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio frowns, confused. “What do you mean?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Turning her head slightly, Agatha says, “I'm talking about what it would be like if you weren't America's First Daughter, that is. If your mum wasn’t the President. Suppose you were just a regular person, living a regular life. What would you be doing?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio thinks about it for a moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, I was just a regular working-class kid for most of my life. Until, of course, my mom became Madam President.” She pauses, glancing at Agatha, who’s still staring at the distant grass. “I’d probably still be a doctor, though I doubt I’d be taking classes at Georgetown. But...maybe I actually would, who knows?” She shrugs half-heartedly. “And you? What would you be doing if you weren’t the Princess?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’d teach, probably.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio chuckles softly, surprised by how easy it feels to picture Agatha in that role, but hearing her say it out loud is something else entirely. “And why can’t you do that now? I could totally see you teaching. Scaring the life out of some poor teenagers just to get them to learn.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s mouth lifts into a small, dry smile. “In a modern monarchy, maybe. But my mother’s idea of being a royal doesn’t really involve working like the rest of the world. We’re supposed to represent ideals, uphold tradition, and add a bit of mystery to the crown. Not live like normal people. So…there’s that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio is unsure of how to respond to that. She always believed that Agatha's actions were a result of her having it easy. Born with a silver spoon, and a crown already halfway on her head. But hearing her now, looking at her now, Rio realizes maybe that attitude wasn’t about entitlement at all. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maybe it was really just armor.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But I guess if my life were actually different, I’d probably date more,” Agatha adds, and Rio assumes she’s trying to make light of the conversation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So she replies, “Yeah, right. Like it’s so hard to get a date when you’re literally a princess.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Agatha doesn’t laugh. “I’m actually telling the truth,” she says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How? There’s no shortage of options falling over themselves for you, Agatha. Hell, you’ve actually got a whole crowd of them, all waiting, all trying to get your attention.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s a hint of bitterness in it, one Rio doesn’t even realize she’s letting slip.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not so much a matter of options if I don’t really see them as options at all.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio blinks, obviously perplexed. “What does that even mean?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha clears her throat and takes another slow breath. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It means, I don’t want the ones who want me.” She pauses, then finally turns toward Rio, facing her fully now. “And the ones I want are definitely the </span>
  <em>
    <span>last ones</span>
  </em>
  <span> I should be wanting.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio’s head is spinning, her thoughts barely keeping up. Is she too drunk to process words properly, or is the cold just making her brain freeze? She stares at Agatha, trying to make sense of the words coming out of her mouth. “Honestly, I still have no idea what you're trying to say.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha grimaces, covering her face and tilting her head upward as if frustrated with herself, then asks, “Do you remember that dare you owe me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio nods, still confused. “Yeah.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think I know what I want you to do now,” Agatha says, her eyes locking with Rio’s, who’s still completely lost in the conversation. There’s a long pause, and Rio starts to wonder if Agatha’s already regretting even talking to a drunk Rio right now. “You still don’t know what I’m talking about, do you?” she adds, her frustration as sharp and clear as an icicle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think you’re lying.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why would I be lying?” Now it’s Rio’s turn to get frustrated. “Seriously, break it down for me like I’m ten.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t believe I’m actually doing this,” Agatha mutters, looking up like she’s hoping the sky will intervene with what’s about to happen. Then she turns to Rio, her eyes locking onto hers again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m daring you to kiss me, Rio!” Agatha says loudly. “I want </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span> to kiss </span>
  <em>
    <span>me</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio instantly feels her breath catch. Agatha’s stare makes the falling snow around them look like a backdrop to something both real and surreal all at once. She’s looking only at Rio, and it’s one of those rare looks people only get a handful of times in their life. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>One that makes you feel wanted, just as you want to be wanted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio blinks, her throat actually choking for air. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“God, you're as clueless as a goldfish!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before Rio can even process what she’d look like as a goldfish, Agatha’s cold hands are suddenly cupping both her cheeks, pulling her in for a kiss. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everything is at a standstill, as Rio's brain scrambles to catch up and make sense of what is happening.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio tries to piece it all together, wondering how they ended up here. She thinks about the lingering looks, the endless texts, the late-night calls, their constant back-and-forth, the ridiculous £65,000 wedding cake, and their tragic first meeting. And then, almost unexpectedly, there's teenage Rio, staring at a girl in a magazine with thick brown hair and piercing blue eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She tries to make sense of why she's kissing that same girl now, but all she can think of is how soft and warm her lips are. And that she actually likes how soft and warm they feel.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio eventually leans into the kiss and is met with the smooth slide of Agatha’s mouth, her lips parting just enough for her tongue to brush against Rio’s. It’s definitely nothing like the kiss with Oliver earlier. Surely nothing like anything she's ever felt before. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s careful, yet completely consuming. New, but achingly warm. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Her whole body seems to react to it: from the sudden rush behind her ribs, the strange fluttering stillness in her hands, and the way her heart kind of stalls for a second too long. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s hand slides into Rio’s hair, fingers threading through and tugging just enough to elicit a small, surprised gasp from Rio that she didn’t even know she was capable of. Her heart is also pounding so loudly that she's convinced Agatha can actually hear it through the quiet garden.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But then, just as quickly as it started, a late round of fireworks crackles in the sky, and Agatha pulls away hard enough that Rio almost falls off the bench. They both just sit there, staring at each other, the fireworks lighting them up in flashes of purple, green, and a bunch of other colors Rio suddenly feels color blind to. Agatha looks at her wide-eyed and totally freaked out, while Rio is still trying to make sense of what just fucking happened.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I'm sorry,” Agatha murmurs, cursing under her breath as she stands up quickly and starts walking away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The fireworks keep going overhead, a celebration far removed from the mess in Rio's chest. She just sits there, mouth open, eyes wide, and still in utter shock. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And before she can even gather her bearings, Agatha is gone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, fuck.”</span>

  <p>There are times when some things just slip out of Rio's head so easily. Like someone’s name five seconds after they tell her, a plot of a book she lied about reading, her dental appointment, her keys, her password, or her dignity after one too many shots. But then there are things – Jesus – there are just things that dig their heels in and refuse to rot like they’re supposed to.</p><p>Rio can barely remember what she ate yesterday, or what she wore at a charity gala last week, but she can still feel the exact way Agatha’s hand fit into her hair, and the devastating way her lips moved against hers. Whatever<em> that </em>was, it’s not going anywhere. It’s something her brain insists on replaying every time she goddamn blinks.</p><p>By the time Rio stumbles back inside, Agatha and her entire royal entourage have already disappeared. And not even her hangover, violent, biblical, and probably illegal in some countries, can smudge the memory of that kiss.</p><p>But she has tried, God, has she tried. And she’s still trying. </p><p>She goes to her classes at Georgetown, thinking maybe academia will save her. But five minutes into a lecture on constitutional law, she’s already doodling a crown, a pair of blue eyes, and the phrase “what the hell was that” in the margins of her notes like some hopeless, confused teenager with a big fat crush. </p><p>Yet again, she really tries to shake it off, throws herself into her mom’s latest economic briefing, eavesdrops on a few cabinet meetings, but not even national policy can hold her attention. Even one of Lilia’s full-blown rants in the West Wing can’t keep her focused anymore. </p><p>By the end of the week, Rio has to admit she’s officially losing her mind, and the worst part is, she has no idea where to even start looking for it. </p><p>Once upon a time, her younger self thought she absolutely adored Princess Agatha. Probably thanks to a glossy photo in some random magazine, a dangerous mix of hormones, and one too many Disney movies. Then she actually met her, found real-life Agatha utterly rude and insufferable, and promptly decided she couldn’t stand her. Then she <em> really </em> got to know her, learned that the actual real-life Agatha was less rude and insufferable and more of a tightly wounded human being – and then she maybe even kind of liked her.</p><p>But after what happened, she has no idea what to feel anymore. All she knows is that somehow, she’s caught in some maddening emotional purgatory in which the Princess is both the gravitational pull keeping her in orbit and the fucking bane of her existence that is making her want to launch herself into the sun.</p><p>And speaking of banes of existence, just in an entirely different category, America’s favorite political loudmouth is blaring from the TV again. </p><p>It’s one of Senator Grant’s classic “facts-optional” speeches or whatever, already halfway to absurdity by the time Rio walks in from a quick afternoon run. </p><p>She peels off her hoodie and tosses it onto a chair, already rolling her eyes before the old man even chokes out another sentence.</p><p>“What this country needs,” Grant says, voice smug and righteous, “is someone who understands true Americans. Not leaders with foreign roots pretending to know what working-class families are going through. Under President Vidal, we’re watching the slow erosion of our nation’s backbone. Real Americans are losing their jobs in real time, hour by hour, day by day. I’ve been to towns where the only businesses still open are a gas station and a liquor store. That’s not progress. That’s neglect,” the bastard drones.</p><p>“Just say you hate anyone who doesn’t look like you and be done with it, Ronald,” Rio mutters before grabbing her phone and tuning him out. In the background, a balding blowhard continues his rant about the so-called collapse of the country. But in Rio’s hands, a quieter collapse stares back at her: a sad little one-sided text chain Agatha hasn’t answered since New Year’s.</p><p>

  <em> [February 2nd]  </em>
</p><p><b> <em>Ralph Vines: </em> </b> <em> Are you going to the PM’s banquet next month? Lilia said Buckingham confirmed. </em></p><p>She scrolls, her thumb hovering over the screen. Then she types:</p><p><b> <em>Ralph Vines: </em> </b> <em> I really hope you’re still breathing.  </em></p><p>Rio looks at the screen as if it may do anything. For a little while, it appears to be possible. Then, a little later, the message delivers, and just beneath it, that subtle little shift: <em> Read.  </em></p><p>That soft gray receipt might as well scream at her. </p><p>There’s no reply. There’s no typing bubble. Just the digital equivalent of silence.</p><p>She locks her phone and sets it face-down on the table. But she doesn’t even make it two steps before it buzzes. Rio’s breath catches. Literally. She turns back, fast, and flips it over even faster. God, she’s probably going crazy thinking this is <em> the </em> text. But it’s not.</p><p>Just a news alert, bright and bold across the screen: <b>Princess Agatha and World-Renowned Neurosurgeon Stephen Strange Seen Sharing Intimate Tea in London. </b>A photo of Agatha and the said world-renowned neurosurgeon stepping out of the Ritz accompanies the headline.</p><p>Rio’s thumb hovers over the screen, then scrolls down, even though she knows she shouldn’t.</p><p align="justify">
  <em> “In a surprise sighting that’s setting tongues wagging from Buckingham Palace to Broadway, Princess Agatha was photographed sharing an intimate afternoon tea with Dr. Stephen Strange, a world-famous neurosurgeon, at The Ritz. The two looked pretty cozy, chatting away like old friends, leaving people wondering if it was just a friendly meeting or something more. Neither the princess nor Strange has said anything about the meet-up, but it’s definitely got people talking. Princess Agatha, known for her reserved nature, appeared unusually at ease beside the famously enigmatic surgeon. As royal watchers hold their breath, one thing is clear: London’s tea just got a lot hotter.” </em>
</p><p><b> <em>@walletmumma: </em> </b> <em> They look so good together. Like, has Princess Agatha finally found herself a fella? Bet all the posh boys are shaking in their boots now.

Priorities, am I right? </em></p><p><b> <em>@ISeeThroughTheBullshit</em> </b> <em> : This looks staged AF! </em></p><p>It’s an hour and a half later when another buzz pulls Rio out of her full-on ceiling-staring spiral. She’s still upside down on the couch, hair hanging off the cushion, one leg dangling off the armrest, when a text from Alice pops up: </p><p>
  <em> Stadium’s cleared. You’ve got it until 9. And this is, by the way, peak dictator-daughter behavior. I’m not sure how Lilia’s gonna react now that you’ve officially out-diva’d every boyband reunion that’s ever booked the place. </em>
</p><p>Another half hour ticks by before Rio finds herself taking another swing at the never-ending stream of baseballs launched from the machine at center field. Nationals Park is dead quiet, empty enough to hear her own breath between swings. If someone flew a drone overhead, it’d probably look dramatic as hell: lone girl, giant stadium, emotional crisis in progress.</p><p>This is her routine when she needs to clear her head. But today, it’s not working. Every ball that zips her way somehow has Agatha’s face stamped on it. Okay, not literally, but in Rio’s definitely-not-lovesick brain, it might as well be. </p><p>Over by the dugout, Herb and Eddie keep their distance, knowing better than to poke their noses into whatever’s brewing with the Capitol's Darling. They’ve both learned that when Rio’s in one of her moods, the safest bet is to let her ride it out.</p><p>She’s in the middle of another swing, about to send another ball flying, when something softly purrs against her shin, followed by an audacious meow. </p><p>She jumps, nearly drops the bat, before looking down. There, padding right up to her, is a scruffy little white cat. It’s small, a little dirty, with patchy fur and big blue googly eyes. </p><p>“What the–” Rio blinks before signaling to stop the machine. Then she crouches down, sets the bat aside, and gently scoops the cat into her arms. It’s light, bony, and cold. </p><p>“Hey,” she says softly, eyeing its scruffy fur and twitchy ears, “what are you doing here, you little goblin?” She brushes a smudge of dirt off its head. “Are you lost? Where’s your mom, huh?”</p><p>The cat just blinks at her, then lets out this tiny, gravelly meow. And just like that, Rio’s brain yanks her back to a weirdly specific memory from years ago: early pre-med days, when there was never enough sleep and always way too much coffee.</p><p>That one weekend she tagged along with a girl she may or may not have been hopelessly crushing on. The girl was cool, older, artsy, and wore rings on every finger. Rio followed her to some bar crawl in Brooklyn, told herself it was just for fun, and a few drinks.</p><p>But a lot of drinks later, she was crammed in the backseat of a yellow cab heading back to campus when she spotted a kitten stuck halfway up some scaffolding outside a deli. </p><p>Rio, being both drunk and incredibly confident for no reason, told the cab driver to stop. Right there. In the middle of the street. While they were literally crossing an intersection. </p><p>She jumped out, ignored the cabbie yelling behind her, and started climbing the nearest fire escape in platform boots and a crop top, determined to rescue the “dumbass cat.”</p><p>She couldn’t remember most of the details, just that the whole block had ended up watching the entire spectacle. Cars were honking, guys shouting out of their windows, and one fancy black town car with tiny flags on its hood was stuck behind their cab, blaring its horn like it had somewhere far more important to be. Which, honestly, it probably did.</p><p>“You owe me nine lives for being this stupid,” she’d told the cat before clambering down with it. Then she turned to the car, flipped it off, and took a bow. The Hunger Games had just come out in theaters that month, and she’d apparently decided she was Katniss Everdeen.</p><p>She smuggled the kitten into her dorm, a place that was definitely anti-pets, gave it a bath, fed it, and decided to call it <b> <em>Perro</em> </b>. Because she thought it was hilarious to name a cat “dog,” just like she’d once named her childhood dog Gato.</p><p>Perro, as it turned out, was a menace and a tiny, ungrateful little demon. He bit her fingers, knocked her phone into the toilet, and even peed on her lab notes. But Perro lasted all of three weeks. Then one day, he was just gone. Either he got ratted out by someone on the floor, or he managed to slip out through the cracked window. </p><p>Now she looks down at the new scruffy stray in her arms. “You better not be another Perro,” she murmurs. Not that the little cat’s likely to ghost her right now. Someone else, with the same blue eyes, is actually doing it. Right this very second.</p><p>The cat just yawns, and Rio hears another meow in the distance. She turns around and sees a bigger cat coming out of the dugout. “That’s probably your mommy,” she mumbles, but before she can finish, the kitten bolts from her arms, sprinting toward its mom, and they both dart out of sight. “Seriously?” Rio calls after them, but the only response is the sound of Alice approaching.</p><p>Rio doesn’t say anything, simply lifting her bat and giving her head of security a lazy salute. </p><p>“Alright, what’s this all about?” Alice finally asks, once she’s close enough to Rio to be heard. She’s still in her uniform, looking like she just walked out of a White House briefing.</p><p>“What’s <em> what </em> all about?” Rio deflects, signaling to the operator to start the machine again. A baseball whizzes toward her, and she sends it flying out to the field.</p><p>“This,” Alice says, gesturing toward Rio. “Some people might not notice, but you’ve been distracted for weeks, and you’re clearly hiding something. Whatever it is, I need to know.” She pauses, giving Rio a pointed look. “And you’d better tell me before I see it all over the news.”</p><p>Rio’s reply is almost immediate. </p><p>“Don’t worry. It won’t be on the news.”</p><p>Alice’s eyes narrow as she crosses her arms. “So, there is definitely something you’re not telling me.” She steps closer, watching Rio take another swing, but this time, Rio misses. The ball drops harmlessly in the dirt. Alice waits, but Rio stays quiet. “Well? Are you going to tell me, or do I need to pry it out of you?”</p><p>With a deep sigh, Rio signals the operator to stop the machine again. She sets the bat aside and runs a hand through her hair, clearly frustrated. </p><p>“Okay, fine. There’s something I haven’t told you,” she admits. “It’s about something that went down on New Year’s Eve.”</p><p>Alice raises a brow, her thoughts immediately jumping back to the mayhem of that night: the wild stunts, the table dancing, the yelling, the grinding, and the shots Rio took that she probably didn’t even want to count. </p><p>“A lot went down on New Year’s Eve,” Alice responds dryly, knowing Rio probably doesn’t have a full recollection of half of it.</p><p>Rio slumps to the ground and crosses her legs, like a kid who just lost a game. </p><p>“This one’s different. And you’ll probably be just as surprised as I am.” She takes a long breath, glancing around to make sure it’s only Alice who can hear her. Alice, ever the good sport, sits down beside her on the ground. “Agatha,” Rio drawls, unsure whether to continue. </p><p>Then another sigh. “Agatha sort of kissed me.”</p><p>She waits for some over-the-top reaction from Alice, but Alice remains calm, almost too calm for Rio’s liking. “I said the Princess of fucking England kissed me,” she reiterates, but Alice just stares at her, like she’s holding back a laugh. </p><p>Why the fuck is Alice holding back a laugh? Rio wonders. </p><p>“And you’re not freaking out?” Rio asks, though it comes out more like a statement. “Why aren’t you freaking out?” Frustration bubbles up in her, because she's the one who’s clearly freaking out.</p><p>Rio gapes at Alice, disbelieving. “Wait. Did you know she was gay?” she presses, feeling all kinds of stupid. Alice just stares at her. “Jesus, Gulliver. You knew this the whole time, and you didn’t even bother to tell me?” The words come out as an accusation, and Rio feels more frustrated and utterly caught off guard.</p><p>“I thought you were supposed to be smart,” Alice quips and adds. “It was obvious.”</p><p>Rio's face twists. “What do you mean it was obvious? An article just came out about her dating some annoyingly British face doctor. And she’s always seen with different guys all the time. It wasn’t obvious, fucking obviously.”</p><p>Alice tilts her head. “Well, maybe because she’s a princess, and the world – her world, more specifically – is not exactly open-minded about this kind of thing? Or maybe it’s not so obvious because, honestly, you’ve been doing the same thing yourself, hiding your own truth for pretty much the same reason.”</p><p>“I haven’t been keeping my own truth,” the latter protests. </p><p>“You haven’t even told your parents, Rio.” The words didn’t come out harsh, but they still landed with a slight sting, because they were true. </p><p>Rio falls quiet for a second, and Alice wisely decides not to dwell on it. She adds, “Why do you think every one of her dates gets photographed? It’s because she’s a lesbian. A really pretty one. A pretty one who kissed you, because, let’s face it, you’re hot.”</p><p>Rio scrunches her nose. “I don’t think she finds me hot.” Alice rolls her eyes, and Rio quickly adds, “Okay, maybe she does. But how can she just, like, kiss me out of nowhere without even telling me she’s into girls first? I mean, how does that even happen?” </p><p>“Maybe she thought you already knew,” Alice says, “Which, clearly, you didn’t, since you’re practically spiraling about it right now.” </p><p>“I am <em> not </em> spiraling,” Rio argues.</p><p>“You clearly are.” Alice smirks, knowing she’s got Rio exactly where she wants her. “Now, why don’t we just talk about the kiss? Was it any good? Did you even like it? Are royal lips different from regular people’s lips?” </p><p>Rio kind of admires how her friend can switch so easily from being her head of security to someone you can just sit with and gossip. She wonders when, exactly, did they manage to build that kind of dynamic. </p><p>She flops onto her back, ignoring the itchy grass poking at her arms. The moon and the stars above look obnoxiously perfect. She waves a hand, groping for the right metaphor. </p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio mutters. “I can’t even really explain how it felt. It was like a supernova went off, and suddenly there were dinosaurs running everywhere because the damn thing was hurling fireballs and space rocks at earth or something.”</p><p>Alice just stares at her, mouth half open, “Wait. So…tongue?”</p><p>Rio groans and covers her face with both hands. “God, I hate you.”</p><p>Alice leans back on her elbows, grinning. “Cool. I’m taking that as a yes, then.”</p><p>“Okay, theoretically, if I did,” Rio starts, pausing dramatically, “which I definitely won’t admit, obviously. But if I did like it, what do you think that would even mean?”</p><p>“It means exactly what you think it means,” Alice replies flatly. “You like her.”</p><p>“What? No. Absolutely not!” Rio recoils like Alice just accused her of murder. “That’s not – just no. You’re wrong. I don’t like her that way. Not even the slightest.”</p><p>Alice squints at her. “Oh, you poor thing. You didn’t know that either, did you?”</p><p>Rio glares. “Know what exactly?”</p><p>"Alright, let me break this down for you. First, you’ve been obsessed with her for years – don’t even try to deny it. And ever since the royal wedding, you’ve been flirting with her across time zones, almost every single day. You know her sleep schedule. She knows yours. You even sent her a Christmas gift, for god’s sake. You spent the whole New Year’s party completely ignoring the hottest people in the room – who, by the way, were literally begging to hook up with America’s most sought-after bachelorette – just so you could literally watch the Princess eye-fuck you in the middle of the dance floor. Don’t even try to deny that, either. And then she kissed you. And you liked it. So, tell me, what do you think that means?” </p><p>Rio thinks about Agatha, and something pulls tight in her chest, like stretching a muscle she didn’t know was sore. She hears Agatha’s voice in her head, soft and half-asleep from one of their late night calls, and suddenly, the simmering fire in her guts and ribcage is given a name.</p><p>Oh boy. She needs to ground herself. Maybe a working hypothesis, just to keep her head on straight. And Rio, in her infinite wisdom, comes up with one, which is – <b> <em>she might be dangerously into a British royal.</em> </b> And the observations that support it are:</p><p><b>One.</b> There is a statistically significant spike in heart rate whenever Agatha is mentioned.</p><p><b>Two.</b> There is a recurring urge to kiss Agatha again, despite social, political, and possibly constitutional consequences.</p><p><b>Three.</b> Retrospective analysis suggests she may have wanted to kiss Agatha for an embarrassingly long time.</p><p>Rio stares at Alice, then shrugs. “I mean, I don’t know.”</p><p>Alice groans. </p><p>“You know you’ve got to give me something if you want me to help you figure this out.”</p><p>“Okay, fine,” Rio says, throwing her hands up. “Maybe, objectively speaking, if we’re breaking this down like a graph or something, it means I’ve got an embarrassingly big crush. But I hated her, like, really hated her. I still think I do. But then there’s this part of me that kind of likes her, in that friend-ish way, I guess. And then she kissed me, and now I have no idea what we are.”</p><p>“So, what are you going to do about it?”</p><p>“I have no clue what to do,” Rio says, her eyes still glued to the sky. “She’s completely ghosted me. Hasn’t responded to any of my texts. If I called, it’d be way too desperate. So, I guess it was just some random thing she did, probably drunk, and now she regrets it. Probably sees it as some mistake and wants to forget about it.”</p><p>“Rio,” Alice says, grabbing her attention and making her look up. “She likes you. Trust me, it’s pretty obvious. Agatha likes you, and she’s probably freaking out just as much as you are right now. But here’s the thing, buddy, you need to figure out how you feel about her, and actually do something about it. It's like a game of chess. And from where you’re standing, she’s not the one who's going to make the next move.” </p><p>Rio thinks about chess, how Agatha made her queen move and put Rio’s king in check. Now, Rio’s left with only one move: either she walks away or risks being completely consumed by whatever this is. But screw the universe, because Rio’s always been utterly terrible at chess. She never bothered to really learn it, never took the time to even understand it, and now she’s kind of wishing she had.</p><p>A brief silence passes between them before Alice speaks. </p><p>“I heard you two have an event coming up.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio says, exhaling. “She’s supposed to be my guest at the new Prime Minister’s banquet next month. It’s the last thing on that whole cake-debacle agreement or whatever. The Crown already confirmed she’s attending, so she can’t just ignore me the entire time.” She pauses, then adds, less certain, “Right? I mean, can she?”</p><p>Alice gives her a look, somewhere between pity and something else, like Rio's a slightly confused blue tang, blissfully unaware she’s swimming straight into a jellyfish field. </p><p>“I guess you’ll find out.”</p><hr /><p>Rio is running late again for the third time this week. It’s a Wednesday, and she’s dragging herself across the quad, already missing half the review session for <b>Influence of Personal Connections on Ethical Choices in World Politics</b>. A class that, in hindsight, seems like it was created just to drive her insane. </p><p>She didn’t plan on being late, but she got sucked into rewriting her speech for a campaign event this weekend in Anchorage, Alaska, of all remote places.</p><p>Behind her, Eddie and Herb trail along, groaning in sync as they stop outside the lecture hall while Rio slides in. She catches the tail end of the session, scribbling down some half-assed notes, already knowing she’ll remember none of it. </p><p>She’s definitely going to fail the exam next week. Just fucking great.</p><p>Rio’s entire mood has rapidly deteriorated by the time she returns to Residence. Frustration, exhaustion, and a nagging sense of dread about everything all combine like a nasty cocktail. She contemplates having a nice one, but she is in too awful of a mood to even drink.</p><p>She’s headed straight for the west bedroom when she hears footsteps. “Well, well, look who’s finally home,” Carlos says, popping up at the top of the stairs. He’s wearing dirt-smeared gardening gloves, which means he’s probably been up in the Solarium battling his collection of ferns again. “Día de mierda?” he asks.</p><p>“Yeah, you could say that,” Rio replies. Because, yes, her dad is right. Her day has indeed been full of shit. She only then notices the magazine her dad is pressing under her arm, the corner poking out. He always has something to read when he’s in the Solarium. The staff probably left a few magazines around for anyone to grab.</p><p>“Well, this might brighten your day a bit,” he says, handing her a fresh copy of <em> People </em> magazine. “There’s a nice article about you on page thirteen. And your new best friend made it in too. She’s on page thirty.”</p><p>Rio already knows exactly who he’s talking about. “Dad, I told you, she’s not my new best friend,” she grumbles, but takes the magazine anyway. She then retreats to her room, slumping onto the couch with the magazine in her hands. She figures she might as well flip through it.</p><p>Page thirteen features a photo of her from years ago. She’s smiling, with much shorter hair, a quieter kind of confidence, looking much younger, and sporting eyeliner (back when it was still a thing). It’s a flashback piece about her junior year as a pre-med student, before her mother, Isabel, became the first female President. </p><p>The article highlights Rio’s academic ambitions, social life, and the strong family bond that grounded her, long before stepping into the political spotlight as the First Daughter.</p><p>She hesitates before flipping to page thirty, pretending she isn’t curious, but her mouth instantly twists into a frown when she reads the title – <b> <em>Royal Rejects: The Bachelors Who Nearly Won Princess Agatha's Heart (And How They Failed).</em> </b></p><p>The glossy spread that accompanies the article features four photographs.</p><p>The first is a candid shot of a younger Agatha, visibly irritated as the press snaps her picture. The caption below reads: Princess Agatha, photographed days before her official debut into public life. Sources claim the British royal slipped into the Big Apple under the radar to meet a mystery man, rumored to be none other than Australian heartthrob Thor Odinson.</p><p>The second photo is more public. It’s Agatha, strolling hand-in-hand through Hyde Park with a duke named James Buchanan Barnes. His smile looks sluggish, while hers is seemingly tight, like she knows the cameras are watching.</p><p>The third photo is a few years newer. Agatha, stepping out of a hyper-expensive sports car alongside American philanthropist-slash-professional playboy Tony Stark. She’s in black silk and heels, while Tony’s grinning at the camera like a fox. It doesn’t look romantic, not exactly. Just two rich, powerful people who simply know they're rich and powerful.</p><p>And then there’s the fourth, the most recent one, and honestly, the most infuriating. Another picture of Agatha with Stephen Strange, the image capturing the exact moment her lips brush the corner of his mouth. The photo that feels like a punch straight to Rio’s gut.</p><p>She doesn’t care that the article says Strange already botched whatever he had going on with the Princess. It’s not the details that rile her. It’s the damn photo. The one that’s making her blood burn hotter with each second she spends looking at it.</p><p>If Rio was already in a mood, well, now she’s downright seething at the sight of Agatha’s lips on someone else’s skin. Someone that isn’t her. </p><p>Who the hell does Agatha think she is? Seriously, how fucking arrogant, detached, and inconsiderate can someone be? To spend months acting to be someone’s friend, letting them in on things no one else knows, exposing the weirdest, most vulnerable parts of themselves, kissing them, turning their world upside down, and then just completely ignoring them for weeks. Only to go out with some guy, and have it plastered all over the goddamn press? </p><p>Rio knows anything that ends up in <em> People </em> is intentional. Agatha wanted the world to know about these guys she’s apparently “dated” – all after she fucking kissed Rio and left her hanging. Rio grits her teeth. She’s angry. Really, really angry. </p><p>She hurls the magazine onto the couch and rises to her feet, pacing as if her body can't hold the rage building in her chest. Fuck Princess Agatha Victoria Eleanor Harkness. Rio should’ve known better than to trust anyone with a name that long. That cold, entitled, calculating, arrogant royal brat. Rio should've listened to her intuition, like she usually did.</p><p>She inhales, then exhales through her teeth. </p><p>Rio has strategic intelligence. She has a political mentality like her mother. It goes quickly, splits into a dozen ways, solves, and rotates all at once. Normally, she enjoys puzzles, but this one had her stuck. She should be thinking like Agatha, seeing herself in royal shoes. </p><p>Instead, her thoughts just stubbornly gravitate to their kiss and this stupid article. And the unsolvable question: how can these two things even fit on the same board?</p><p>And then she hears Alice again, <em> “Why do you think every one of her dates gets photographed?” </em></p><p>Rio pauses mid-step, thinking about Agatha. How she always feels just a little out of reach. Like everything she does is calculated to the decimal. Like there’s a massive glass wall between her and everyone else that is clear enough to see what’s on display, but still fucking impossible to get through. </p><p>Rio, in all her dumbass optimism, really thought she might’ve made it through. Only to end up face planting straight into that damn glass wall anyway.</p><p>Then the thought quietly enters her brain’s left hemisphere: <em> If there were a princess, someone who couldn’t live openly, someone who had to bury parts of herself beneath a carefully crafted image, what would she do after kissing someone she probably shouldn’t have? </em></p><p>The answer slides in just as quietly: <em> She’d cover her tracks. She’d create a distraction. She’d give the press something else to chew on. She’d protect herself the only way she knows how.  </em></p><p>And just like that, Rio’s anger doesn’t burn so hot anymore. It just aches. She also thinks she might be heartbroken. Maybe even worse, because she thinks Agatha might be, too.</p><hr /><p>Agatha can’t keep avoiding Rio indefinitely. It’s simply not feasible and realistic. Eventually, their paths will cross, whether the Princess likes it or not. And there’s still one last thing to wrap up from their post-royal wedding deal — Agatha’s attendance at another state banquet.</p><p>With England’s newly appointed prime minister, Isabel is eager to make the introduction. Naturally, Agatha’s coming. But this time, she’ll be staying at the Residence instead of Blair House, as a gesture of goodwill. And, as Isabel has said, a much-needed change of scenery.</p><p>Rio stands in line with her parents, just like last time, but this time she feels like she might pass out. She really needs a drink. No, she desperately needs one. But tonight, unfortunately, she’s decided that she's staying sober. She has learned her lesson from two months ago. </p><p>The last thing she needs is another drunk mess of a situation. She hasn’t even touched a drop since then. Honestly, Agatha really fucked her up. She can't even have a drink now to forget what happened because, knowing her luck, she’d just end up thinking about it more.</p><p>She’s well aware she’s fidgeting as they stand in line greeting guests. Her mind’s a million miles away. Probably still somewhere near page thirty of last month’s People issue. </p><p>She sneaks a glance across the room and spots Alice. She’ll definitely need her later if she wants even half a shot at cornering Agatha alone. Then her eyes land on her parents. She’s not ready to tell them anything yet. Not until she’s sure what this even is. </p><p>Because once it’s out, it’s out. No undoing it.</p><p>“Madam President,” a familiar voice breaks through the din, instantly grabbing Rio’s attention. She turns toward it and spots her sort-of ex, standing in front of her mom. “Daphne Everhart, Washington Post,” she adds delightfully, holding out her hand.</p><p>Isabel lifts a brow in astonishment. “Everhart? I didn’t know Christine Everhart had children.” </p><p>Daphne chuckles gently. “No, she didn’t. My aunt remains proudly free and childless. I’m her niece. I wrote that piece about you and Senator Grant’s little sparring match last week.”</p><p>Rio bites down on the inside of her cheek. A bold move, referencing that article. The same one that called Isabel a “charming tactician” and compared Grant to a “malfunctioning blender.”</p><p>Isabel nods, impressed. “Ah yes, I remember. I actually enjoyed reading that one. You’ve definitely got more bite than your aunt. Pass along my regards when you see her.”</p><p>“I will,” Daphne says, before finally turning to Rio, flashing those perfectly polished veneers. Blondes really do get the best lighting on television, in print, and in real life. </p><p>“Rio,” she says, as silky as ever.</p><p>“Daffy,” replies Rio with a tight smile.</p><p>“You look incredible,” Daphne comments, eyes skimming down and up again. “Red’s definitely your color. Makes your eyes appear even warmer.” She gives Rio a look that straddles the line between compliment and something less innocent.</p><p>Rio tenses, suddenly all too aware of the fitted gown hugging her body. If she were in a better headspace, she might’ve laughed. Maybe even flirted back. But right now, her mind’s on other things, or other people. “Thanks,” she says, then catches herself. “You too. You look great. I mean, your dress. It’s…it’s very nice. Really suits you.”</p><p>“Some things never change,” Daphne laughs, just a little too pleased with herself, then leans in slightly, making sure only Rio hears. “You still get flustered every time someone flirts with you.” </p><p>Rio scoffs, “I do not.”</p><p>“Oh, you totally do. It’s cute.”</p><p>Rio forces another tight smile and nudges the conversation somewhere safer. </p><p>“Are you covering this for the Post?”</p><p>“Officially, I’m just here as a guest,” says Daphne, smoothing a hand down the front of her dress. “Unofficially…well, there’s always a story when the world’s most powerful people share a table.” She shifts slightly, then adds, “Speaking of which, I read one of your essays at Georgetown. The one where you completely eviscerate Grant’s ridiculous claim that non-white people are stealing jobs and causing labor shortages. It’s a powerful piece.” </p><p>Rio straightens her spine. “Wait, really? How? That wasn’t even published.”</p><p>“Rio, I’m a journalist with some pretty capable sources. Let’s just say a friend of a friend forwarded it to someone who forwarded it to me. That’s kind of the gig,” she pauses, then adds, “Anyway, I think it’s brilliant. I love how you made his whole rhetoric sound even dumber than it already is. It’s angry in all the right places. If you’re up for it, I can run it in the Post.”</p><p>Rio stares at her. “You’d do that?”</p><p>“Of course. I’d be lucky to have it published. I really think it deserves to be read,” Daphne smiles and continues, “We could go over the details sometime. Maybe over coffee? Or perhaps a couple of cocktails at the Quill…”</p><p>Rio, however, misses the remainder of the conversation. Because just then, a ripple of movement spreads across the room as a new arrival walks in. She doesn’t even need to look to know who it is. A loud voice from the press pool confirms it for her anyway.</p><p>“Princess Agatha, this way, please!”</p><p>Agatha enters in a tailored, off‑shoulder navy long dress, fitted at the waist with slightly dramatic sleeves. Her dark hair falls in effortless curls, framing her face as if it were styled by the gods.</p><p>Rio doesn’t even realize she’s been holding her breath until Agatha’s eyes rest on her. Rio can practically see the internal debate on the Princess’ face: whether to turn around and walk out or just keep going. After a brief pause, Agatha pulls her eyes away from Rio’s and walks forward.</p><p>“Hello?” Daphne waves a hand in front of her face. “Earth to Rio.” </p><p>“Sorry, what?” Rio mumbles, blinking like she’s shaking off a spell. “Can you excuse me for a sec? I think Lilia’s trying to wave me down. I’ll catch up with you later.” She flashes Daphne a quick, distracted smile, already stepping past her before she can even get another word in.</p><p>“Alright, let’s get some photos,” Lilia grumbles in Rio’s ear as she’s finally pushed next to the Princess. “Big smiles now,” she orders, subtly dragging Rio into place alongside Agatha. </p><p>Even though their shoulders are barely brushing, Rio can still feel the tension haunting the mere inches between them. She tries to focus on her breathing, desperately avoiding that familiar lavender scent. Jesus, Rio hates that she likes it so much. She doesn’t even like lavender. </p><p>But when it’s tied to Agatha, it’s all she can think about.</p><p>“Hi,” Rio says under her breath, forcing a smile as the cameras flash around them. She instantly regrets how soft and awkward it came out. “It’s nice to see you’re still among the living.” </p><p>She sneaks a glance, but Agatha remains rigid: back straight, smile tight, and eyes fixed on anything except Rio. “Can we talk? Please?” she adds more seriously, and way more desperate than she meant to sound. God, she wants to punch herself.</p><p>But before Rio can get a reaction from her, Lilia pushes them into an even more amicable position, the press snapping more photos. </p><p>Rio had hardly had time to gather her breath before she is ushered out of the cameras and into the State Dining Room. Agatha, meanwhile, gets quickly pulled into another set of photos with the newly appointed prime minister.</p><hr /><p>Everyone is settled around the kind of dinner table so long and massive you could lose a cousin at the other end. Agatha is perched beside the new prime minister, sipping wine and conversing with practically almost everyone but Rio, all while flashing that surgically polite smile at everyone else but Rio. Meanwhile, the so-called “but” is a few seats down, stabbing and biting her food with the fervor of someone in the middle of a street brawl.</p><p>Rio keeps stealing glances across the table, and every now and then, Agatha also looks up. And every time they lock eyes, Rio’s imagination speeds through a thousand violent choices, and she seriously considers chucking her knife at Agatha’s annoyingly pretty face. </p><p>But then she stops herself, realizing that, damn it, the warm light from the hundred-year-old chandelier above them is making Agatha look like a damn painting that is too beautiful to scar. </p><p>Plus, just as she’s about to do it, Agatha casually goes right back to her dumb pumpkin ravioli. </p><p>Yeah, that's not the finest idea. What if Rio misses and accidentally skewers the new prime minister instead? No. Rio is certain jail isn’t her hue, and she’s not exactly ready to trade her designer dress right now for an orange jumpsuit.</p><p>Rio wipes her mouth like she’s about to strangle someone. Again, who the hell does Agatha think she is? Waltzing into Rio’s turf, munching on food Rio’s dad meticulously picked, and acting like she didn’t French and swap spit with her under Rio’s favorite linden tree, then ghost her for two straight months?</p><p>​​She takes another furious mouthful but prevents herself from cursing out loud. Damn it, why does this ravioli have to be so damn good? Instead, she pushes her chair back, and makes her way toward the other side of the room, where the majority of her Secret Service is posted. </p><p>Rio has had enough of the charades that have been going on.</p><p>“I need your help,” Rio mutters to Alice, who, by the way, looks like she saw this coming from a mile away. “I need to talk to her. Like, right now. Privately. Just Agatha and me.” </p><p>Alice throws a quick glance toward Agatha’s own security team before turning back to Rio. “You’re not getting her alone anywhere else, even if you ask nicely. The Red Room is all I can arrange. Anything beyond that is not advisable.”</p><p>Rio looks back at the large mahogany doors across the dining room, the Red Room looming visibly vacant on the other side. “That’s fine. I can swing that.” </p><p>She spins on her heel and heads straight for the dessert table, where Agatha just happens to be standing next to an Italian envoy, carefully picking out eclairs. Rio does not squander a second. She steps effortlessly between them, and blocks Agatha's view of the other pastries. </p><p>“Hi again,” Rio says, giving an exaggerated smile. “Sorry to interrupt the pastry party, but we’ve got some, uh, global matters to sort out.” Without waiting for a response, she grabs Agatha by the elbow and steers her away from the eclairs.</p><p>“Do you mind?” Agatha practically sneers at her. The audacity of this royal brat, Rio thinks.</p><p>“Just stop talking,” she shoots back, quickly yanking Agatha away from other people's ears. Fortunately, everyone else is too wrapped up in their own conversations to notice her roughly dragging a princess out of the dining room.</p><p>They eventually reach the threshold, where Alice awaits. She peers between the two of them, then squints suspiciously at Rio. “You’re not about to throw her out a window or anything, are you?” she asks, one hand still gripping the knob.</p><p>“Depends,” Rio tells her before shoving the door open and tugging Agatha into the crimson chamber. “You have five minutes,” Alice calls after them just before Rio slams it shut.</p><p>“What exactly do you think you’re doing?” Agatha asks brusquely. </p><p>“Are you fucking serious? You’ve been avoiding me for months, and now you’re the one acting all pissed?” Rio snaps at her. If she isn’t currently fighting the unholy urge to kiss Agatha foolishly right now, she might opt to launch the nearest antique vase at her head instead. </p><p>The Princess looks momentarily caught off guard by Rio’s bluntness, but she quickly reins it in, schooling her face into something more inscrutable, icy, and dangerously distant. </p><p>“We don’t have to do this, Rio,” Agatha says, like she’s offering mercy. “I am aware that my behavior was revolting. I had a few drinks. I got bloody drunk. And you were completely off your face. Clearly more inebriated…” </p><p>Rio just stares at her, barely hearing anything over the roar in her own head. Agatha’s still talking, something about not knowing what came over her that night, but Rio’s too distracted watching her lips move, too distracted by the fact that she hasn’t even had a single drink and somehow her head is spinning like she just did six tequila shots. </p><p>Rio keeps watching Agatha, suddenly losing all concept of what’s going on inside her own head. It feels like those tiny cartoon people in her brain are frantically setting documents on fire while Agatha’s voice turns into the human equivalent of a mosquito buzzing in her ear – and goddamnit, she just wants that mosquito to shut the hell up.</p><p>“Please, for the love of god, can you just be quiet?” she blurts out, and before Agatha can even form a vowel, Rio grabs her by the waist, yanks her close, and crashes their mouths together.</p><p>For one awful second, Agatha just stands there, lips parted in pure shock. And for another horrifying beat, Rio thinks back to her working hypothesis: that she might, in fact, be dangerously into a British royal, and that she may have just made a catastrophic mistake by misreading the entire situation. </p><p>She’s convinced she’s about to get slapped. </p><p>Or shoved out a window. </p><p>By said British royal. </p><p>But then – bless all things holy and gay – Princess Agatha eventually starts kissing her back.</p><p>And Rio doesn’t hesitate, doesn’t think, doesn’t even breathe. She simply pushes Agatha’s back straight into the nearest wall. The contact is dizzying. It’s not just good, it’s borderline criminal how good it is. So good, it actually makes her a little mad. </p><p>Like, what the heck have they been doing all this time? Bickering? Side-eyeing each other across rooms? Wasting time arguing when they could’ve been doing <b> <em>this</em> </b>?</p><p>Rio feels Agatha’s hand slide from cupping her face to squeezing her bare thigh, and for a second, Rio seriously considers screaming, except she’s too worried about the guests in the next room hearing it. Agatha surprises her by effortlessly lifting her onto the table close to the wall. Her scarlet dress rides up as one of her legs hooks around Agatha’s waist, and she gasps into the kiss, completely caught up in how damn hot this all is.</p><p>“Wait,” Agatha breathes, drawing away with wide eyes, her mouth smeared with both their lipsticks, and Rio finds herself briefly distracted by the sight. She genuinely considers tugging her to the window and continuing this elsewhere. “What are we – what on earth are we doing?” </p><p>Rio, whose head is still reeling from the kiss, swears she might just bang it against the wall to make the world stop its damn spinning. Both of them are breathing hard, their cheeks flushed.</p><p>“What?” is all she gets out, her body practically combusting, heat rolling down her torso and pooling, well, right between her thighs. </p><p>And somewhere in the overheated, dumb back alleys of her psyche, a very serious question forms: is it medically possible to get drunk off a kiss, or is she just a hopeless idiot who’s way too thrilled to be making out with someone this stupidly hot?</p><p>“I mean, this whole thing...this might be a really bad idea,” Agatha stammers, waving vaguely between them, her hands as lost as her words. “Don’t you think this is a terrible idea?” Her piercing blue eyes lock with hers, and all Rio can foolishly think about is how those eyes might look if they were staring at her completely naked instead.</p><p>“Your Highness,” Rio says, holding her face like that’ll somehow slow down her own racing, absolutely stupid brain. “I think we’re way past the point of good ideas.” She leans in, right up close to her mouth. “So how about we stop overthinking and just let the lips do the talking?”</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha breathes, her eyes like the kitten’s moony ones Rio saw last time, and she can’t help but enjoy this new side of the Princess unfolding right before her. “Yeah, we could do that.”</p><p>And Agatha does so, lifting Rio’s other leg and presses in closer, pulling her into another kiss. Rio has to bite back a laugh when she glances up and catches a row of old presidents practically glaring down at them from the wall. Not every day the First Daughter makes out with a literal princess in front of a bunch of misogynistic dead guys.</p><p>At some point, Rio’s lip gets caught between Agatha’s teeth, and then she feels the heat of Agatha's lips on her throat just before her head hits the wall. She can’t tell if she’s about to pass out or scream. Everything’s too much, too hot, like she’s caught in a fog of old anger and some painfully overdue truth she still doesn’t want to name out loud.</p><p>“Alright, time’s up! Her Royal Highness is needed for a speech,” Alice’s voice calls through the newly cracked door. “I’m not about to lose my job over whatever’s going on in there. I'm specifically talking to you, Rio.” </p><p>Rio breaks out of her trance, removing her legs from Agatha's waist, as the latter stumbles back into her heels. They lock eyes, both of them breathing hard, chests rising and falling. Rio takes a second to stare at Agatha, and wipes the smeared lipstick from her lips with her thumb, brushing it across Agatha’s mouth. Rio can see how tempted Agatha is to lick it off. </p><p>Damn, how is she becoming increasingly hotter?</p><p>Rio swallows hard, her face burning brighter than the red of her dress. “Okay, so here’s what we’re gonna do,” she says. “You’re going to take your dangerously royal face and maintain a five-hundred-foot radius from me for the rest of the night, or I’m going to do something incredibly stupid in front of, like…a terrifying number of very powerful, and very nosy people.”</p><p>Agatha just looks at her, clearly amused. “Right. Sounds like a sensible plan.”</p><p>“And then later,” Rio continues, hovering over Agatha’s face, her breath warm against her lips, “when all the speeches and small talk are dead and gone, you’re going to find me. Second floor, west bedroom. And if you pull a Houdini on me again, I swear to God I’ll personally make sure you’ll be banned here by federal law. Are we fucking clear, Your Highness?”</p><p>Agatha swallows whatever sound tries to escape from her, her eyes zeroing in on Rio’s mouth. Then she smiles, like a wolf spotting dinner served on fine china. </p><p>“Crystal clear, dearest.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Back in the 1800s, during President Monroe’s “everything must look fancy and French” phase – an actual design choice, according to historical records – the East and West Bedrooms on the second floor of the White House were likely just one oversized, heavily styled suite. </p><p>Word is, it was all decked out for the Marquis de Lafayette during his wildly celebrated tour of the U.S. in 1824. Eventually, someone with a little more practicality decided it was all a tad excessive and split it into two more practical quarters. </p><p>These days, Rio’s got the West Bedroom, conveniently parked right next to the elevator. Perfect for late-night snack runs and, as it turns out, even more perfect for certain people to stumble upon her a little too easily tonight.</p><p>Her parents, of course, reside in the southwest corner in what is traditionally the President’s Bedroom. In theory, the First Lady, or in this case, the First Gentleman, gets their own space, but Isabel has nixed that idea real fast. </p><p>Something about seeing the love of her life at the end of the day being non-negotiable, constitutional etiquette be damned. “I didn’t marry him just to see him at breakfast,” she’d said when the staff suggested separate rooms, like all the other presidents have had.</p><p>The east side of the Residence, meanwhile, is mostly for guests of significant status. The Rose Room or the Queen’s Bedroom, named after Queen Elizabeth II who stayed there in 1957, is tucked in the northeast corner. It’s the room for high-ranking visitors, diplomats, or anyone with their own security team. So tonight, it’s Agatha’s room. </p><p>Far enough from Rio, but not nearly far enough.</p><p>“This is insane, right? I’m actually losing it, aren’t I? What the hell was I even thinking?” she tells herself. Rio is, without a doubt, losing her damn mind as she paces back and forth across her room. She’s already done four laps around the rug, checked her phone thrice, and changed her mind about her outfit twice. She pauses by the mirror, then keeps going, as if moving enough will stop her from spiraling. </p><p>This is fine. Really. Totally fine. </p><p>It’s probably the dumbest idea she’s ever come up with. But sure, it’s fine. </p><p>She eyes her closet again, seriously debating whether to ditch the red dress, the one with the slightly torn slip from their earlier lapse in judgment (and undeniably excellent kissing) in the Red Room. </p><p>She freezes halfway through digging for options because, honestly, what are you even supposed to wear when you’re maybe about to do something wildly inappropriate with someone who is, by all accounts, wildly inappropriate? Like, say, inviting the actual Princess of England into your bedroom. In the White House. To possibly have sex.</p><p>God bless America, honestly.</p><p>She sits down on the edge of her bed, stares at the door, and tries to act like her pulse isn’t loud enough to be heard outside. She shuts her eyes, takes a deep breath, and immediately regrets it because it does absolutely nothing. No calm. No clarity. Just more Agatha.</p><p>Agatha, the pretty girl from the glossy magazine pages. Agatha, the princess on the balcony. Agatha, half-buried under frosting and fondant at the wedding. Agatha, under the snow-covered linden tree in the garden. And Agatha, maybe (just fucking maybe) in her bed.</p><p>Which would circle right back to Agatha: the problem.</p><p>She tells herself she doesn’t have feelings for this woman. That’s not what this is. It’s casual. Harmless. People hook up all the time. Sure, maybe not with the actual Princess of England who, until very recently, she couldn’t stand but still — this happens.</p><p>People do dumb, impulsive things all the time. And Rio’s in her late twenties. She can easily blame it on hormones. Curiosity. A temporary lapse in sanity.</p><p>Rio glances at the clock. Then the door. Then back at the clock. Her thumbnail ends up between her teeth before she even notices, and when she does, she drops her hand fast. She hasn’t done that since seventh grade – thought she kicked the habit. But apparently whatever this thing is between her and Agatha has her regressing like she’s thirteen. </p><p>True to Rio’s word, they had spent the rest of the banquet intentionally avoiding each other, which was laughable, really. Just a lot of lingering eye contact from opposite ends of the room.</p><p>It didn’t help. Not even a little. If anything, it made everything worse, especially for Rio. The whole time, she was just trying not to sprint across the room and kiss Agatha again in front of everyone, which felt like a bold new low for her already questionable impulse control.</p><p>Seriously, what was it about this woman? What kind of royal nonsense came with that sort of gravitational pull, like Rio was some idiot satellite doomed to crash into her over and over again? The longer the silence drags, the worse the spiral gets. </p><p>Maybe Agatha changed her mind. Maybe she thought the kiss was a mistake. Maybe Rio kisses weirdly. Maybe she has weird lips. “Oh God, do I have weird lips?” Rio mutters, immediately horrified she’s asking that out loud.</p><p>She groans, drops her face into her hands, and sinks lower into the bed like maybe the mattress can absorb her shame. Would Agatha actually come up? Or had Rio just completely hallucinated the whole thing? God, she really <em> hopes </em> she didn’t imagine all of it.</p><p>But even as she tries to talk herself down, her eyes are thrown back to the door again.</p><p>Hope is annoying. </p><p>Hope is a menace. </p><p>Hope is currently wearing a blue gown and taking her sweet, royal-ass time.</p><p>Just as Rio’s about to collapse into another round of self-inflicted turmoil, she hears footsteps in the hallway. Her heart jumps like it’s trying to punch a hole through her ribcage. That has to be Agatha. Who else would be creeping around the second floor of the White House at this hour?</p><p>She bolts upright, nearly knocking over her lamp, and rushes to the mirror. </p><p>Her hair’s fine. Her face looks normal. Confident, even. At least…mostly. </p><p>She was confident earlier when she practically launched herself at Agatha, so there’s no reason she shouldn’t be now. She wants this. She definitely wants this. Wants Agatha’s mouth on hers again. Agatha on her bed. Agatha on her. All in that order. Or maybe all at once. She’s not picky.</p><p>She’s halfway to the door, hand already reaching for the knob, when she hears another set of footsteps. Then voices. Very familiar voices.</p><p>“Your Royal Highness,” comes her mom’s unmistakable voice.</p><p>Rio freezes as if she has been shot with a tranquilizer dart. “Oh shit,” she murmurs to herself, pulling her hand away from the doorknob and pressing her ear against the door.</p><p>“Madam President,” she hears Agatha say, polite yet a little startled. Clearly, she had not anticipated running into anybody in the hall.</p><p>“Ay, darling, you don’t have to be so formal with me in this house,” she hears her mom say, clearly not missing that she just called Agatha by the same sweet nickname she uses for Rio. “There are no cameras here. Just call me Isabel.”</p><p>A pause. Then Agatha’s voice again. “Then please, just call me Agatha.” </p><p>Rio slowly cracks the door open just enough to see them. Her mom’s back is turned, still wearing her gown from the state dinner but now paired with terry cloth slippers. Meanwhile, Agatha stands opposite, still in her show-stopping blue dress, looking not the slightest bit ruffled.</p><p>Their eyes meet.</p><p>“What are you doing all the way over here, dear?” Isabel asks, blissfully unaware of where Agatha’s eyes are locked. Rio, still hidden behind the door, waves a frantic hand, mouthing something along the lines of s<em> top looking at me and talk to my mother, for the love of god. </em></p><p>“Did Lilia forget to show you to your room?” Isabel adds.</p><p>Agatha clears her throat, a light flush rising to her cheeks. Rio also notices the way her brows quiver, as if they're resisting the urge to furrow. Clearly, the British Princess isn’t thrilled about being gently bossed around by Rio.</p><p>“Uh, no, she did. I mean, she showed me. I just have a terrible sense of direction, apparently.”</p><p>Rio locks her lips tight before she can say anything, since she honestly did not expect Agatha to fumble over her words in front of her mom. She silently mouths another <em> really? that’s the best excuse you could come up with? </em>Agatha simply stares her down before turning away.</p><p>Rio feels like disappearing into thin air as she watches Agatha, seemingly flushed and vulnerable, standing there with her hands neatly folded in front of her. </p><p>Or maybe she just wants to yell. Or better yet, scare her mom off so she can finally shove the Princess up against the nearest wall and kiss her all over again. Honestly, with her stomach doing undignified flips and a certain other part of her heating up, pretty much anything is on the table at this point. But, of course, Rio wouldn’t admit any of it. Not even under oath.</p><p>Jesus, what kind of royal voodoo is Agatha casting on her?</p><p>“Well,” Isabel says, looping her arm through Agatha’s, and Rio can’t help but nearly facepalm at the obvious breach of protocol. That’s Isabel Vidal, alright. Always getting way too comfortable with people. Rio half expects Agatha to flinch, and sure enough, there’s the tiniest twitch of surprise. “Since we didn’t get a chance to really chat earlier, how about we catch up in the Treaty Room for a bit? That is, if that’s alright with you.”</p><p>Agatha’s blue eyes glance back at Rio one last time before returning to Isabel, a delicate, almost shy smile gracing her lips. “Yes, of course, I’d quite like that.”</p><p>And just like that, the President escorts the Princess away, leaving Rio standing in her doorway. She closes the door softly, leans her forehead against it, and mutters, “Great. Just had my booty call intercepted by the leader of the free world.”</p><p>She slides down to the floor and stares at the ceiling. And if she happens to Google the survival rate of throwing herself out a second-floor window, well, that’s nobody’s business but hers.</p><hr /><p>Rio slides into her bed in her matching mustard pajamas, adorned with little dinosaurs doing random stuff like lifting weights and wearing party hats. They’re intended to be fun and comforting, but right now they feel like a poor attempt to keep her from plummeting.</p><p>In fact, the cheerful stegosaurus smiling up from her thigh is really starting to piss her off.</p><p>She stares at the ceiling. Flips onto her side. Stares at the wall. Flops onto her back again. Kicks one leg out from under the blanket. Too cold. Puts it back in. Too hot. </p><p>She groans and punches her pillow, then immediately regrets it because now her arm hurts and the pillow’s still lumpy.</p><p>With a loud groan, she kicks the blanket off and grabs her phone from the nightstand. There are a hundred unread notifications: group chats, news alerts, and a fitness app guilt-tripping her about steps, but not the one she actually wants. Which, somehow, just makes everything worse.</p><p>“Screw this.” </p><p>Fortunately, everyone else on the floor, which includes only Rio’s mom and dad, is deep sleeping and completely out cold. So she steps into the dim corridor and marches past the grand staircase as if on a quest, though it’s unclear what she’s really trying to accomplish. </p><p>Clearly, reason has fled the building. Logic is in slumber. And Rio definitely is not.</p><p>Eventually, she finds herself staring at the mesquite door of the Rose Room. Rio just stands there for a second, debating whether to knock, and almost certainly losing her mind.</p><p>“What the hell am I even doing here?” she hisses at herself, looking down at her bare toes on the cold floor. Now she undoubtedly looks like a barefoot oddball dressed in dino PJs. She bites her lip, takes a deep breath, and shakes her head. “No. This is nuts. This is embarrassing. This is downright insane. This is not you, Rio. Definitely not you.” </p><p>Instead of knocking, she backs away and collapses onto the sofa in the adjacent room. Squinting at her phone’s bright screen, she sees it’s one in the morning. “Great. Just perfect,” she groans, dropping the phone onto the cushions and burying her face in her hands.</p><p>Just as she’s about to turn and head back to her room, the door to the Rose Room suddenly swings open. There stands Agatha, framed in the doorway, wearing a beige silk nightdress that looks like something out of a medieval fairy tale.</p><p>Oh, Rio is so screwed.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes go wide, just as shocked to see Rio standing there.</p><p>“Hi,” she says, still trying to wrap her head around it. </p><p>The Princess definitely looks like she hasn’t fallen asleep yet, probably been tossing and turning herself. Or maybe it’s the jetlag again, Rio thinks, trying not to sound too crazy in her own head.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio manages, which is pretty much all the words her brain can handle right now.</p><p>Silence hovers between them for an unnaturally long time until Agatha quietly asks, “Can’t sleep?” And Rio just shakes her head. Agatha nods once. “Yeah. Me too.” </p><p>God. Rio wants the floor to swallow her whole. Since when is she this speechless?</p><p>Agatha leans against the doorframe, a pleased smile now pulling on her lips. “So, your mom’s a bit of a yapper too, huh?” she says, almost like she’s not sure if she’s allowed to find it funny.</p><p>That pulls a laugh out of Rio, thank god. “Yeah. She kind of is.” </p><p>She stays standing, shuffling herself from one foot to the other, unsure what to do with herself as her eyes track Agatha, who brushes past her and sinks into a nearby chair.</p><p>“Were you leaving?” Agatha asks, noticing Rio still on her feet.</p><p>Rio swallows hard. “Do you want me to leave?” </p><p>Agatha looks up at her, really looks at her. Those blue-blue eyes catch hers and hold, lingering just a second longer than what’s socially acceptable. Rio’s breath stutters. She suddenly needs to know what’s going on behind those eyes. What Agatha sees when she looks at her, what she’s thinking. What she’s feeling. What <em> she </em> is, in Agatha’s eyes.</p><p>“I wouldn’t mind if you stayed a while.”</p><p>And just like that, Rio sits back down. </p><p>Her head goes completely blank. What the hell is she even supposed to say now? Should she bring up what happened earlier? But how – when they haven’t even talked about what led up to it? Or maybe just mention how she invited Agatha to her room just a few hours ago. Or maybe it’s better to just stay quiet and pretend none of it ever happened.</p><p>With so much silence between them, the huge sitting room suddenly appears much too tiny for Rio. And since Agatha won’t stop staring, Rio starts fiddling with the flowers on the side table. Somehow, through it all, she can tell Agatha’s quietly smiling at her for being such a goof.</p><p>“Nice jammies, by the way,” Agatha comments, nodding at the dinosaurs on Rio’s shirt. “Did you pick those out yourself, or did your inner five-year-old make the call?”</p><p>Rio laughs. “Hey, other grown-ups can definitely rock this look. Except maybe you. I doubt royals like you have anything fun besides those boring monotone colors you always wear.”</p><p>Agatha only rolls her eyes. </p><p>Rio knows the Princess would never wear something like this. But then she catches herself imagining it nonetheless. Agatha in Rio's oversized shirt, waking up next to her, hair tangled, and maybe even snoring. </p><p>Then she snaps out of it almost immediately. She jumps up so fast it’s like the chair shocked her. That’s way too far ahead, way too far from where they are now. Rio mentally condemns herself for even letting her thoughts wander there.</p><p>But it doesn't help that Agatha is suddenly standing right in front of her.</p><p>“I thought you said you were going to stay a while?” </p><p>Jesus, how does this goddess of a princess suddenly look like she’s about to pounce? Her blue eyes dilate, and Rio can feel her own doing the same. She swallows hard, probably for the third time tonight, and wonders if she’ll have any spit left by morning. </p><p>“I, uh, I did. But I’m also trying not to completely embarrass myself while I’m at it.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes light up with something Rio can’t quite describe as she steps closer. </p><p>And the First Daughter finds herself having trouble looking away from the Princess’ face. It’s the kind of face people would have put on a coin back in ancient Roman times. Hell, Rio thinks, England should retire the queen and put Agatha on the pound instead.</p><p>Then Agatha’s breath gently touches Rio’s lips. “And I’d say you’re failing spectacularly at that,” she says, their noses almost touching. “So why don’t you stop trying whatever that is, and just do <em> exactly </em> what you really came here to do.” </p><p>When she finally kisses Rio, Rio’s already smiling like a lunatic, hands curled around her wrists like they’re the only things keeping her grounded on earth. There’s something different about this kiss. Something leisurely and maddeningly tender, like the Princess is trying to write poetry with her tongue and Rio’s the fucking parchment. She doesn’t know what has changed or why it feels like a Jane Austen phantasmagoria, but hell if she’s going to stop it now.</p><p>It’s exactly how Rio thought a woman like Agatha would kiss. Like standing on the edge of Pemberley at sunset, everything golden and ridiculously romantic, as if Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy might just round the corner, nod solemnly, and say, “Carry on, lesbians.”</p><p>And holy shit, Rio is reminded once again that she’s never actually been kissed like this before.</p><p>Agatha pulls back just enough to breathe. “So, how exactly are we doing this?”</p><p>And then Rio immediately realizes they aren’t standing on the sweeping lawn of Pemberley Estate. But the only good news is that they are at least one hundred-sixty feet away from the other end of the Residence, so whatever this is turning into won’t disturb a single soul. Except, naturally, Rio’s progressively deteriorating sanity.</p><p>“Why don’t you get on the sofa,” Rio says, expecting Agatha to argue, but surprisingly, she doesn’t. She sits exactly like Rio told her to, glowing like sin in silk.</p><p>Rio stands over her, pulse obnoxiously pounding in her temples. She looks down, eyes trailing from Agatha’s blue ones to her nose, then to those soft, ridiculously luscious lips. </p><p>She feels like she’s back in the Bahamas for the first time: standing on a high ledge, seconds from swan-diving without a single safety net. She leans down, one hand behind Agatha’s head.</p><p>“Still haven’t heard the real reason why you’ve been dodging me for months,” she says, her lips just shy of touching. “And then you went out with somebody. A guy, no less.”</p><p>“Dearest, I'm a lesbian,” the Princess says, and something about the way she said it, or perhaps the fact that Rio finally heard it loud and clear, hits her hard. “Lesbian as a labrys.”</p><p>Rio lets out a laugh and kisses her again. “I have no idea what a labrys is,” she says, now straddling the royal. “Is that like some kind of aggressively queer tree or something?”</p><p>Agatha chuckles, her lips brushing Rio’s jaw. “Huh, it’s an axe, actually. Notorious for its very strong lesbian tendencies. I assumed you’d know that. You’re someone I figured would be into sharp, deadly things.” Rio catches her breath as Agatha begins kissing down her neck.</p><p>“That still doesn’t explain why you didn’t answer any of my texts. It felt like I was talking to a wall. If I’m being honest, I probably should still be pissed at you.” </p><p>“I wasn’t sure it was something I could even want,” Agatha says, her hands finding Rio’s waist, lips still dangerously occupied. “I – I thought wanting this wasn’t smart. Not with everything I’m tied to. And I also wasn’t sure if you’d end up hating me even more for kissing you.”</p><p>Rio pulls back slightly, looking at her. “But you still kissed me.” </p><p>Then she leans in, letting her lips trace a slow, teasing path across the fragile skin just behind Agatha's ear. For a second, she swears she can feel the Princess holding her breath.</p><p>“Because I suppose I hoped you wouldn’t. Hate me. Even though, truth be told, I don’t actually give a toss if you do. It’s just that I had this feeling, this utterly daft, reckless feeling, that maybe you wanted it too.” She winces a little when Rio nips gently at the side of her neck. “Or at least, that’s what I told myself. Until I saw you with that actor, and I couldn’t even remember his bloody name —”</p><p>“Oliver?” </p><p>“— and yeah, maybe I was being a bit of a muppet, losing my patience and getting tired of waiting around for something to just happen. I must admit, it was very, very stupid.” </p><p>“Wait. You were jealous?” Rio asks, eyebrows up. Her brain’s still buffering the thought.</p><p>Agatha gives her a light shove on the shoulder.</p><p>“Out of everything I just said, that’s what you decide to zoom in on?”</p><p>“So that’s a yes?”</p><p>Agatha scoffs. “No. I wasn’t.”</p><p>But the slight pink rising in her cheeks, and the way she immediately avoids eye contact, kind of tells Rio everything she needs to know.</p><p>“Okay, just so we’re clear. Oliver is gay,” Rio blurts out, then immediately regrets it. “Shit. I probably shouldn’t have said that.” Outing someone to another someone isn’t exactly in her personal code of ethics. But then again, Agatha isn’t just <em> some </em> someone to her anymore. At least not tonight.</p><p>“I mean, like nobody else knows about it. He’s not gay publicly, so I’d really appreciate it if you didn’t tell a soul. I just wanted you to know that he’s gay. And I am also, very definitively, unmistakably, as gay as he is. Possibly gayer. If there were a leaderboard, I’d be above him.”</p><p>Rio catches a tiny glimpse of relief in Agatha’s eyes, but she quickly suppresses it and just says, “I'm not even sure why you’re bothering to explain. I told you, I <em> wasn’t </em> jealous.” </p><p>“Your tone’s saying something else, though.”</p><p>Agatha suddenly shifts, grabbing Rio firmly with both hands and pulling her down to the other side, Rio’s head against the armrest. Agatha’s on top of her now, and her voice drops to a pitch Rio has never heard from her before. </p><p>“I said I wasn’t. Now do be a dear and find something better to do with that mouth.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t need to be told twice. There’s something wild and powerful about yielding to Agatha’s royal dominance. A high that is both terrifying as well as completely euphoric. </p><p>As Agatha drags her into another searing kiss, Rio can’t help but think, half astonished, half horrified that she may never forgive herself for being this damn obedient.</p><p>Agatha pulls away again, and Rio instantly hates herself for chasing her lips. “Just to be perfectly clear, this changes absolutely nothing between us.” </p><p>Rio stares at her, chest rising like she just sprinted through a dream. Agatha looks dead serious, and suddenly Rio feels like an idiot for feeling anything more than the high of this dizzying...whatever the fuck this is.</p><p>“Yeah,” she replies, nodding. “Was just about to say the same.”</p><p>Then she cups the back of Agatha’s neck and pushes her back toward her. Their lips crash together again, the kiss going from clumsy to impatient to downright desperate.</p><p>She can practically hear both of their moans as she drowns herself in the slick slide and pull of Agatha’s mouth. Their lips are gonna be bruised to hell after this.</p><p>Agatha’s lips trail from Rio’s mouth down to her neck again. And Rio’s head falls back, lips parting, her heartbeat bashing out a rhythm that has nothing to do with logic and has everything to do with how Agatha feels against her now.</p><p>Then Agatha’s hand gradually slips beneath the hem of Rio’s shirt. Her fingers spread across Rio’s breast, and a breathy sound escapes her, almost embarrassed at how easily she’s melting at the touch. “Your Highness,” she whispers, trying to sound in control, and failing terribly. </p><p>Agatha’s mouth quirks. “Who would've guessed America’s golden girl gets all helpless and needy when touched just right?”</p><p>“Oh, fuck you,” Rio laughs, because what else can she do with her brain turning to soup?</p><p>“No, dearest. I’m going to fuck <em> you </em>.”</p><p>Just then, a loud, obnoxious buzzing starts up somewhere under Rio’s thigh, followed by the screaming intro of Hollaback Girl, which is strident enough to wake the entire damn building, and possibly Gwen Stefani herself.</p><p>
  <em> Uh-huh, this my shit. All the girls stomp your feet like this… </em>
</p><p>Both she and Agatha freeze like they’ve just been caught robbing a bank. “Fuck,” Rio blurts out, already peeling herself off the Princess. Her shirt’s all twisted up around her ribs, her face is burning, and her heart continues to throb violently in her throat. “Jesus, that’s my phone.”</p><p>
  <em> A few times I've been around that track. So it's not just gonna happen like that… </em>
</p><p>Agatha sits up as quick, like she’s just surfaced from underwater and can’t decide if she’s pissed or vaguely entertained. “I gathered,” she says, dripping with dry wit while already shoving throw pillows left and right. “I think it’s buried here somewhere. God, did you really have to set your phone volume this loud?”</p><p>
  <em> 'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl. I ain't no hollaback girl… </em>
</p><p>Rio groans, her cheeks burning like she just smacked into a brick wall. The ringtone’s somehow way louder in the dark, probably loud enough to wake every poor sod within a hundred-sixty feet. Fuck. Fuck-fuck-fuckity fuck, she thinks, cursing every damn setting on her blasted phone.</p><p>Finally, her fingers close around the phone, squinting at the screen flashing some random number. She glances over at Agatha, who looks just as intrigued about who’s calling Rio in the middle of the night. Rio hesitates for a beat, then just answers, just to kill the damn noise.</p><p>“Hello?” she says, breath catching.</p><p>“Rio!” comes with a familiar voice, honey-smooth and a touch overly joyful for this infernal hour.</p><p>“Daffy?” </p><p>“Yeah, it’s me. Sorry for calling so late, but I just couldn’t wait. And knowing you, I figured you’d still be up, probably reading or something. Hope I’m not interrupting any serious studying.”</p><p>Rio turns to Agatha, who’s watching her like she’s trying to eavesdrop on every word. “No. No, you weren’t,” she replies, bending the truth a bit, since the whole ‘studying’ bit was mostly Agatha’s hands taking their sweet damn time exploring her body just seconds ago.</p><p>“Good. Because I just got off the phone with my editor. Your essay got the green light. Can you believe it? It didn’t even take days to get approved. She’s really into it and wants to run it in the Sunday paper. Full spread.”</p><p>“Wait, seriously?” </p><p>“Absolutely serious,” Daphne laughs. “Let’s meet for coffee tomorrow, if you’re free. I want us to figure out how to get the most out of this. Trust me, this piece could give your mom’s campaign a solid boost, and make Grant look pretty bad in the process.” </p><p>“But isn’t this kind of a gray area?” Rio asks, brows furrowed. “Like...doesn’t this go against some of your journalistic code or something? You’re supposed to be neutral, and here you are basically doing cartwheels for my mom’s campaign.” </p><p>“Oh please,” Daphne scoffs lightly. “Publishing a personal essay isn’t an endorsement. I’m running a strong, honest piece that just so happens to show a certain candidate’s daughter as human and relatable. If that resonates with people, and by extension, reflects well on your mom, that’s not bias. That’s just effective writing.”</p><p>Rio just chuckles and looks back at Agatha, who suddenly looks away, a little too quickly. Like she just realized she’d been listening a bit too closely…or maybe didn’t like what she heard. Rio figures it’s probably the first one.</p><p>“So that’s settled, then. Coffee tomorrow. I’ll text you the specifics. And don’t even think about bailing on me,” Daphne adds from the other end.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio breathes. “Yeah, coffee. Definitely.”</p><p>As the call ends, the room reshapes itself around her again. Rio turns to Agatha, still turned away, the soft glow from outside the tall window catching the bridge of her nose and her lips set in a tight line. “Sorry about that,” she says, lowering her phone.</p><p>“Pretty voice.”</p><p>“What?” Rio blinks. </p><p>“The woman who called you. She’s got a pretty voice,” Agatha says, casual as a landmine, and Rio suddenly feels like she’s being tested without knowing the subject.</p><p>“Well, I think that kinda comes with the job,” Rio says. “She’s a journalist. Daphne Everhart. I don’t know if you’ve heard of her? She writes for the Post. Does some TV stuff too.”</p><p>“Ah. TV,” Agatha repeats, like she has just identified the opposing chess piece. She turns her head slightly, allowing Rio to catch a glimpse of something indecipherable under all that grace. “Does she usually call you this late?”</p><p>“What?” Rio says, like someone just asked her to recite the alphabet backwards. “No. Of course, she…she doesn’t. She just called about some essay of mine getting published.”</p><p>Agatha hums. “Well. Congratulations,” she says, and her tone is so inscrutable, Rio may as well have tripped over her own shoelace outside Buckingham Palace.</p><p>“It’s really not a big deal. It’s just an essay,” Rio mumbles, suddenly forgetting how to word.</p><p>Which is rich, considering five minutes ago they were halfway to getting absolutely wrecked by each other. And now they’re just sitting there like two chickens in a coop, wings half-spread, both not sure whether to peck at each other or pretend none of it ever happened.</p><p>She looks over at Agatha, who’s staring straight ahead again, cheeks just as flushed as Rio’s but somehow a hundred times more breathtaking. </p><p>Rio can’t even wrap her head around the fact that she’s been sitting this close to a real-life princess, that she touched her, that she even got to kiss her. </p><p>She fights the urge to blurt out, “So, you wanna keep kissing or what?” because honestly, every inch of her body is begging for a fucking yes.</p><p>But before her own brain can embarrass her any further, Agatha suddenly stands up, brushing off her nightdress like there’s dust on it. “I should probably get to bed,” she says, all serious and queenly out of nowhere. “Early flight back to London tomorrow.”</p><p>Rio’s head feels as if it’s exploding in slow motion, and she wants to curse whoever or whatever, had the nerve to crash what was supposed to happen. </p><p>“Right,” she answers instead, feeling as though someone just unplugged the warm little buzz coursing through her veins. “Yeah, uh, yes, of course.”</p><p>She stands up too, grabs her phone, and rubs a hand over her lower back like she’s trying to work out the tension. Without a word, she falls into step behind Agatha, heading toward her bedroom door.</p><p>Rio watches as the Princess pauses in the doorway, one hand resting on the frame. She then glances back and catches Rio hovering awkwardly, like a lost puppy. </p><p>That earlier annoyed look on Agatha’s face softens into something else, something Rio can’t quite read, not with the bedroom light casting her in silhouette.</p><p>“Well, I should, uh, I think I should probably…” Rio tries, suddenly very interested in the floor.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>She glances up. “Yeah?”</p><p>Their eyes lock, and something changes in Agatha’s face, enough to make Rio feel desperately helpless against it. There’s a small smile, then a smirk, like the Princess knows exactly what Rio’s thinking and is daring her to act on it. </p><p>“You literally just had your tongue in my mouth. You’re allowed to kiss me goodnight.” </p><p>Rio’s smile wobbles, a little crooked and shy. She leans in slowly, her chest hammering so loud the other woman might as well hear it as she meets her halfway. But instead of a kiss on the cheek, Agatha’s lips brush delicately against the corner of Rio’s mouth before pulling back with that maddening calm she always has. </p><p>“Try to keep your phone on silent next time we do this. We don’t want to be waking people up for the wrong reasons,” Agatha says with a sly smirk. </p><p>Rio freezes at the thought of a next time, her brain already tripping over what that could mean. But before she can even say a word, Agatha simply winks and shuts the door right in her face, plunging Rio into the dark silence of the Rose Room’s sitting area.</p><p>She catches sight of a portrait of Lafayette glaring at her from the wall, dimly lit and looking like he’s about to toss her off the cliffs of West Point into a pit of gunpowder and cannon fire. </p><p>Somewhere in the back of her brain, she swears she hears cannons booming, swords clashing, and her stomach does that embarrassing flip-flop again.</p><p>Yeah, Rio’s definitely in deep trouble now, and if this keeps up, she’s going to blow up harder than a powder keg.</p>

  <b> <em>VIRAL VIDEO — Princess Agatha Shuts Down Sexist Question About Her Role in the Royal Family</em> </b>
</p><p><b> <em>Interviewer: </em> </b> <em> “As your brother, His Royal Highness Prince Edward, prepares to start his own family soon, how do you respond to the fact that your position in the line of succession will inevitably move further back? Do you ever worry that, since you’re a woman and the spare, your role and influence within the monarchy might be considerably diminished, especially compared to his, as the future head of the family and the one who will carry on the royal legacy?” </em></p><p><b> <em>Princess Agatha: </em> </b> <em> “It’s curious how, even today, a woman’s role in this institution is still framed by how far back she stands in a queue. Especially when that framing suggests her role is, as you’ve put it, ‘diminished’ simply because she’s a woman.  </em></p><p>
  <em> My brother may be starting a family, and that’s certainly a milestone worth celebrating. But to suggest that his future role as ‘head of the family’ somehow makes my own contributions less important reveals a stubborn misunderstanding of what it means to serve this institution, and this country. The monarchy does not thrive on outdated assumptions about gender, but by commitment and capability of those who uphold it.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> If ‘carrying on the legacy’ means clinging to antiquated ideas that a woman’s influence is lesser, then perhaps it’s the legacy that needs rethinking. Not my role.”  </em>
</p><p>The eight-hour flight to Anchorage might be aboard Air Force Two, but even with all the legroom and presidential-grade seat warmers, it still feels like the longest flight of Rio’s life. Technically, sure, she’s had way longer flights than this. But this one just<em> feels </em> endless. Probably because, for the first time ever, she just wants to be back in DC.</p><p>It’s not that she’s dreading Alaska. It’s not Alaska’s fault. It’s not even that she doesn’t want to meet some Alaskans or shake a few hands for her mom’s campaign. That’s fine. She’s officially packed for it. Mentally, physically, emotionally...well, okay, maybe not emotionally. Because the real reason this flight feels like a ten-hour crawl through molasses is that Rio’s head is a mess.</p><p>There’s a whole mess of unfinished business waiting for her back home. </p><p>For starters, she’s got an exam she’s definitely not prepared for. There’s also that charity fundraiser she promised her mom she’d show up for. And the nonstop parade of campaign meetings that seem to multiply faster than rabbits on Red Bull.</p><p>And then there’s...something else.</p><p>The literal princess she almost had sex with.</p><p>Yes. That little footnote in her week.</p><p>Agatha, bathed in moonlight in that ridiculously elegant nightdress. Agatha’s nails digging into her back. Agatha's fingers dancing across her chest. Agatha’s tongue slipping inside her mouth.</p><p>Thirty thousand feet in the air, and all Rio can think about is the royal she almost took to bed.</p><p>And now, instead of running through her speech like a responsible First Daughter, Rio’s scrolling through the comments on Agatha’s latest video. </p><p>In her defense, it’s not like she went looking for it. The damn thing begrudgingly popped up on her feed like a divine offering from the gods of the internet. </p><p><b> <em>@charlottefromchelsea: </em> </b> <em> ‘perhaps it’s the legacy that needs rethinking, not my role’ — fuck, did she just rewrite feminism in real time??? </em></p><p><b> <em>@academicangela: </em> </b> <em> As a gender studies lecturer: yes, yes, and yes.

But she wants to. At least to Alice. But then she couldn’t. And not because she’s scared — okay, partially because she’s scared, but mostly because how the hell do you even start that conversation?</p><p>Besides, she’s legally barred from saying anything anyway. She and Agatha both signed airtight NDAs, making sure that whatever happens behind closed doors stays behind closed doors. So now it’s just her, her extremely loud brain, and the ghost of Agatha’s hands all over her.</p><p>Just as Rio’s about to go deeper into royal-family YouTube, a sudden ping interrupts her screen.

</p><hr /><p>Despite the biting wind and thick, stubborn snow that should have started melting by now, since summer’s supposed to have already started, Rio somehow manages to get through her speech without freezing her fingers off. All the while, she talks about climate change and the real progress her mom’s administration has been pushing.</p><p>“The government can pass all the laws it wants, but real change won’t happen until billion-dollar companies start putting the planet before their profits. It’s time for corporate responsibility to finally match government ambition,” she has said, a seemingly controversial statement that will no doubt be picked up by media vultures within the next 24 hours.</p><p>There have been clapping, flashing cameras, a few laughs at Rio’s perfectly timed jokes, and, of course, even more camera flashes. There have also been handshakes and smiles as she moves through the crowd. At one point, a kid with gloves bigger than his head even hands her a bunch of wilted fireweed, which earns a grin from Alice, who loves teasing Rio about being America’s version of a princess. And once again, Rio is reminded of Agatha.</p><p>That’s why, instead of heading straight back to the tarmac for another eight-hour flight of Agatha-filled thoughts, Rio decides to roam the city. Alice begrudgingly agrees, especially since the plane still needs to be refueled, giving Rio a rare window of free time.</p><p>Her team hands her a list of spots to check out, top of which is <b>Polar Bear Gifts</b>, the so-called biggest souvenir shop in the state. </p><p>But instead of going there like a normal person, Rio ends up wandering a few blocks down until she finds herself standing in front of a tiny shop tucked between a laundromat and a bait store. </p><p>The bell above the door gives a tired little jingle as Rio steps inside, stomping snow off her boots. The place smells like cedarwood, peppermint, and something vaguely old-lady floral. </p><p>Herb and Eddie trail behind her, poking through shelves of moose-head mugs and a wall of hoodies that say <em> Alaska: Colder Than Your Ex. </em> </p><p>Rio checks her phone every now and then, half-expecting Alice to text that the plane’s good to go, until she suddenly stops short in front of a low wooden shelf near the back.</p><p>Two stone bears, sitting side by side — one black, one white — carved in rough strokes and facing completely opposite directions. She crouches down and picks them up.</p><p>“They’re the last pair,” comes a voice behind her. </p><p>Rio turns to see an older woman at the counter, late seventies, maybe. Wearing a chunky blue cardigan, with thick gray braids wrapped into a crown. </p><p>She walks over to Rio and looks down at the bears in her hands. “My husband carved those,” the woman continues. “He used to make them in pairs every winter. Those were the last ones he finished before he passed.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers tighten slightly around the stone bears. “They’re beautiful,” she says, then adds, “I’m really sorry about your husband.”</p><p>The shopkeeper gives her a soft smile. “He passed away a few years back,” she says gently. “Cancer. His hands gave out before his lungs did.” She then glances at Rio, who’s still turning the bears over in her hands, obviously puzzled by the way they face opposite directions.</p><p>“They’re meant to be that way,” the woman explains. “White bear, black bear. Fire and water, he used to say. Two opposites that desperately crave balance. Fire teaches water how to rise. Water teaches fire how to rest.”</p><p>Rio raises a brow, studying the bears again. “That’s a hell of a lot of philosophy for a souvenir,” she thinks out loud, and immediately regrets saying it so openly.</p><p>Fortunately, the woman laughs, her eyes crinkling warmly. </p><p>“He always liked saying things that don’t quite make sense on paper,” she says. Then, with an even warmer tilt of her head, “Are you planning to give these as a gift to someone?” she asks, and Rio appreciates how the older woman talks to her like she’s just another regular customer.</p><p>Rio honestly hadn’t thought of giving it as a gift, but after everything she’d heard about the meaning behind the bears, a particular person came to mind once again.</p><p>And soon enough, her phone buzzes. Not the text from Alice she’s been waiting for, but one of those algorithm push notifications that somehow always knows exactly what she’s into. </p><p>This time, it’s a video of Agatha outside Buckingham Palace. She’s dressed in a taffy-pink long-sleeve top and a brown leather skirt, probably just coming from a private audience with the Queen. She’s walking toward her car, smiling and waving to the crowd — when out of nowhere, a toddler in a puffy purple jacket waddles up and grabs her purse like it’s a plush toy.</p><p>The mom freaks out and tries to pull the purse back, but the kid’s got a grip like a tiny koala. Around them, people can’t help but laugh and pull out their phones, clearly finding the whole thing adorable, especially when Agatha simply smiles and casually motions for the kid to keep the purse. Rio actually laughs out loud at her phone because it’s just that funny. </p><p>She copies the link, opens her messages, and quickly sends a text.</p><p><b> <em>Ralph Vines:</em> </b> <em> You getting pickpocketed by someone who probably can’t even spell “pocket” might be the funniest thing I’ve seen all week. </em></p><p>The reply comes quicker than she expects.</p><p><b> <em>Arthur Hardass: </em> </b> <em> Delighted to know I remain a source of your amusement even from miles away.  </em></p><p>Rio lets out a snort and starts typing, but then her phone buzzes again.</p><p><b> <em>Arthur Hardass: </em> </b> <em> Also had a read of your essay. Shockingly well put together. Starting to think all those photos of you with a book everywhere, all the time, might actually be real. </em></p><p><b> <em>Arthur Hardass: </em> </b> <em> Anyway, I’m turning in early tonight. I’ve got the absolute pleasure of enduring a rather dull garden party at Highgrove first thing tomorrow. Do me a favour and say hi to the polar bears for Señor Scratchy. Maybe he’ll finally warm up to just how American you are. </em></p><p>Agatha signs off with a blurry picture of herself, cheek pressed against Scratchy’s fluffy face. </p><p>Rio smiles, already thinking she might have to give the Princess a quick lesson on taking a decent selfie the next time they see each other.</p><p>“Want me to wrap those up for you?”</p><p>The shopkeeper’s voice suddenly snaps Rio back to herself. She looks down, a little startled to realize she’s still holding the bears like they’ve been glued to her hands. For a second, she also forgets she’s even in the store. She taps the bears lightly, then meets the shopkeeper’s eyes.</p><p>“Either of you got cash?” she asks, turning to Herb and Eddie, who just exchange a look.</p><hr /><p>“Okay, so Monday’s the town hall in Wilmington. Your mom wants you front and center again. Same drill as always. Just smile and nod unless someone talks to you directly,” Lilia says without looking up, flipping through a thick folder of Rio’s schedule. </p><p>“Also, I set up a quick detour to your old high school. The campaign photographers are obviously coming along, so do try to look decent for a few pictures.”</p><p>“What do you mean try? I look decent every day,” Rio says, half-melted into the couch after her exam. Hoodie up, mismatched socks, and a sad, half-eaten granola bar clutched in her hand. </p><p>Lilia just ignores her and keeps going. “Tuesday, you’re shadowing Isabel during the environmental bill hearing. Media’s gonna be there, so maybe don’t yawn on camera again.”</p><p>“I yawned once.”</p><p>“Three times,” Lilia says, cutting off any argument. “And your mic was <em> on </em> the third time.”</p><p>Rio didn’t even bother denying it. She probably did yawn three times. She’d just been exhausted that week, juggling work, school, and a bunch of public appearances, not because talking about the environment bored her, like the media so gladly claimed.</p><p>“Wednesday, you’ve got the morning off until eleven. Then there’s that podcast appearance...” Lilia flips through her folder, squinting at the page. “Next Gen Politics. That’s the one. Hosted by someone named Jordan Lee. Ring any bells? Pretty sure your young ass knows who that is.”</p><p>“Wait. Isn’t that the guy who talks like he’s the one running for office? Isn’t he kind of...intense?”</p><p>“Haven’t watched a single episode,” Lilia says, waving a hand like she’s swatting a fly. “But apparently he’s got over two million followers on Instagram, three on YouTube, and another two and a half on whatever platform you kids are using nowadays. Your mother’s gonna need every last one of them. So do me a favor and be extra charming, will you?”</p><p>But before Rio can react, Lilia flips the page and keeps going.</p><p>“Thursday, you’re in North Carolina for a college tour stop, breakfast with the mayor, quick Q&amp;A, then a meet-and-greet,” Lilia continues, still reading off her notes. “Friday, you’re staying overnight in Charlotte. There’s another town hall, another school visit, some clean energy site they want you to tour, and then dinner with the local campaign team. And I expect you to have something inspiring to say at that dinner. Understood?” </p><p>“Please tell me I’ve got at least one free day.” </p><p>“I’m afraid you’re completely booked this week,” Lilia says, flipping a page. “Saturday’s the youth brunch in Charleston. Press will be hovering, so be ready for some quick on-the-spot interviews. Then afterward, it’s straight back to DC because Sunday’s double duty. First is the Community Futures breakfast with neighborhood organizers, small business reps, the usual folks doing the actual work. Then you’ve got the Youth Vote Now fundraiser in Anacostia.” </p><p>“Will the week after be the same?” Rio asks, bracing herself. </p><p>Lilia flips a page. “No major travel,” she says, skimming the schedule. “Just a couple of fundraisers around the city. Still official appearances, so I expect you to be prepped and present. I’ve already sent Alice a copy, so unless you’ve got any pressing questions —”</p><p>She pauses, looks up, and eyes the half-eaten granola bar in Rio’s hand, then down at the growing trail of crumbs on the floor.</p><p>“— I’m gonna need you to vacate my office before you shed any more of that snack.” </p><p>Rio laughs, pushing herself up from the chair and brushing crumbs off her lap. Her eyes catch a pile of magazines on the side table, with Agatha’s face staring back from the cover on top.</p><p>She thinks about telling Lilia what’s been going on between her and the Princess. After all, she’s unofficially her mom’s campaign manager, and unofficially her other mother, as some would say.</p><p>But just like with certain details she’s kept from Alice, she can’t quite bring herself to share it. </p><p>So instead, she smiles and says, “Well, it’s always nice visiting your office, Lilia. The hospitality’s always a treat.”</p><p>Her mother’s chief of staff raises an eyebrow but can’t stop herself from smiling faintly. </p><p>“Save your sweet talk for the campaign trail. Now, out you go, kid. I’ve got plenty more to deal with today.” She nods toward the door while already reaching for the next folder.</p><p>Rio closes the door behind her and just as she’s about to take another step, her phone pings. It’s a text from Agatha, with a photo of her back at the children’s center, rocking not one, but three bright, colorful friendship bracelets that totally clash with her plain gray dress.</p><p><b> <em>Arthur Hardass:</em> </b> <em> Nicky got a bit carried away and made a bunch of these. Said I should share them with my other “friends.” Still trying to figure out where you fit though: friend, adversary, or just the infuriating American who gets under my skin.  </em></p><p><b> <em>Arthur Hardass:</em> </b> <em> I take it Kensington’s not on your calendar anytime soon? </em></p><p><b> <em>Ralph Vines:</em> </b> <em> Is that an actual invite from Her Royal Highness? </em></p><p><b> <em>Arthur Hardass: </em> </b> <em> If you want it to be. </em></p><p>Rio stares at the screen for a while. Agatha’s basically inviting her over, without actually saying the words. And deep down, Rio wants to say yes. She wants to see Agatha. Whether that’s about picking up where they left off or just being in the same room again, she still isn’t sure.</p><p><b> <em>Ralph Vines: </em> </b> <em> As tempting as it is to fly back to your little medieval castle, I have a lot on my plate this week. And I’m pretty sure if I bail, the President will permanently revoke my air miles. </em></p><p><b> <em>Arthur Hardass: </em> </b> <em> Well, I figured you’d be busy. I’ll hang onto Nicky’s bracelets till you actually show up. But don’t take too long. I have a feeling Señor Scratchy thinks you’re getting one and might try to eat all the beads out of spite. </em></p><hr /><p>The entire week goes by in a blur. </p><p>And by the time Rio finally makes it back to her apartment — not the White House this time — she doesn’t even know how to begin describing how exhausted she is. </p><p>But instead of getting the decent night’s sleep she’s absolutely earned after a nonstop week of campaign stops, she finds herself, yet again, deep in the black hole of Princess Agatha videos online.</p><p>The fifth one in the last hour is a throwback to a much younger Agatha, probably a year or two after her public debut, standing in the Great British Bake Off tent wearing a pastel apron.</p><p>She’s already broken two mixers, flour’s stuck in her hair, and Rio can practically see the curse words dancing behind her eyes as she fights hard not to say them out loud on national TV.</p><p>“Well, if the goal was to represent the Crown by nearly burning down the kitchen on the most famous baking show in England, then I’d say job well done,” young Agatha quips, waving a hand at the collapsed sponge and the second mixer she somehow managed to snap in half.</p><p>“I’ve broken not one, but two mixers. Which I feel must be some sort of record,” she adds, one hand on her hip, flour streaked across her cheek. She glances at her station, then back at the camera. “My father’s quite the baker. Despite his rather busy schedule, he insists on baking his own bread every Sunday. If he catches this episode, I’m sure he’ll be absolutely mortified.”</p><p>Then Paul Hollywood, from the neighboring station, approaches her. “How are we doing over here, Your Royal Highness?” he asks. “Think the sponge’s baked all the way through?”</p><p>“Absolutely not. But I thought if I smiled hard enough, you’d ignore that,” she replies.</p><p>She keeps going, talking about how her father will be very disappointed to see this mess, realizing she’s just turned a sponge cake into edible rubble.</p><p>But she’s laughing while she says it. Really laughing. Even her striking blue eyes look happy and warm in a way Rio’s not used to seeing. And before she even realizes it, Rio’s smiling too. Stupidly. At her laptop screen.</p><p><b> <em>@bakeoffwatcher:</em> </b> <em> Can’t believe they actually let a princess try to bake on national TV.  </em></p><p><b> <em>@taskmasternotdead:</em> </b> <em> went down a rabbit hole watching royal videos and stumbled on this gem. young princess agatha looks so carefree, it’s unreal. </em></p><p><b> <em>@kitchenknight: </em> </b> <em> The Crown might not need a baker, but we definitely need more of her. </em></p><p><b> <em>@fastandthecurious:</em> </b> <em> The fact she was allowed to participate is wild. </em></p><p><b> <em>@frompariswithcringe: </em> </b> <em> I adore her little snort.

Rio immediately pauses the video, and grabs her phone. </p><p>“What do you think about polo?” Agatha says the second Rio picks up, skipping the hello entirely. Rio checks the time: it’s probably two in the morning in the UK.</p><p>“Polo?” she echoes. “Like the sport?”</p><p>“Yes. I’m going to a charity polo match this weekend. Something Jen’s foundation is putting together,” she says, then pauses, probably double-checking whatever itinerary Billy has already handed her. “It’s in Wellington, Florida. Jen said it’s about a two-hour flight from DC. I was wondering if you’d like to come. With me.”</p><p>Rio sits up a little straighter. “Oh. Uh. Are you sure? I mean, I don’t really know how to play polo. I don’t know the first thing about it. I don’t even know how to get on a horse without help.”</p><p>She practically hears Agatha’s amused smile through the phone. “Good thing you won’t be playing then. I will,” the Princess says, and Rio stops herself from dragging a hand over her face. God, of course she’s the one playing. Makes way more sense, she thinks.</p><p>“You’ll be watching, nice and safe from the sidelines. Probably holding some very expensive sparkling water, in your pretty sundress, just like everyone else,” Agatha adds, and Rio’s brain trips over the last part.</p><p>“You want me to wear a sundress?” she asks, like she’s not entirely sure she heard that right.</p><p>“What?” </p><p>She hears Agatha completely laugh on the other end, almost exactly like the laugh from the video she just watched. There’s even that little snort, and Rio can’t help but secretly hope she hears that laugh more often from now on. </p><p>“God, no. Not a requirement, obviously. Just whatever makes you comfortable. It’s just…most women wear sundresses to these sorts of things. I assumed you might go that route, considering it’ll be warm out, with the sun and all.”</p><p>“Right. Yeah, uh, you’ve got a point,” Rio stammers, and eventually chuckles along.</p><p>“So, is that a yes?”</p><p>Rio opens her nightstand drawer and starts rifling through papers, looking for a copy of her schedule Alice left behind. Not that it really matters, because deep down, she already knows she’s going.</p><p>“I still have to double-check my schedule,” she tells her, trying not to sound too eager. “It’s still kind of a busy week, but I’ll see what I can do.”</p><p>There’s a pause, then Agatha’s voice comes through again. “All right,” she says. “Just let me know. I’ll have Jennifer save you the best seat.” She says good night and hangs up, leaving Rio thinking of nothing but Agatha’s mouth on hers again.</p><p>That’s how Rio ends up in a flowy Tory Burch maxi dress on a Sunday at the Palm Beach Polo and Country Club, squinting under the Florida sun and wondering what kind of parallel universe she just walked into. All around her are flutes of champagne, linen blazers in pastel colors, and more sun hats than she’s ever seen outside of a Kentucky Derby. </p><p>The woman directly in front of her is wearing a wide-brimmed hat with an actual taxidermied squirrel perched on top. To her left, a man in salmon pink trousers and loafers talks loudly about his family's horses. On the right, two women with tiny dogs in matching Gucci skirts are fake-laughing so hard that Rio’s a bit secondhand embarrassed.</p><p>No amount of American football tailgates or baseball games could’ve prepared her for this particular brand of elite absurdity.</p><p>And she hasn’t even spotted Agatha yet.</p><p>She turns to Alice, who’s trailing a step behind, while Herb and Eddie settle into their usual flanking positions just off to the side. Rio gives Alice a look, the universal what did we just walk into kind. But her head of security only shrugs, the slightest twitch of a smirk revealing how much she’s enjoying this already.</p><p>“Rio!” someone calls. Rio turns, and finally spots a familiar face cutting through the sea of sundresses and expensive sunglasses.</p><p>“Jen,” Rio says, already smiling.</p><p>The Florida socialite is impossible to miss, even in a crowd like this. Today, she’s draped in a pale yellow slip dress with chiffon panels swishing around her heels. Oversized sunglasses rest on her nose, and gold bangles clink on her wrists. There’s a reason they call her the Florida heiress back in London. Subtle’s never really been her thing.</p><p>“Really glad you could come,” Jen says, giving Rio a quick side-hug before turning to Alice. “And you too, Agent Gulliver. It’s nice seeing you.” </p><p>That welcome has a tinge of familiarity, maybe even a little flirty — and sure enough, Alice responds with a polite nod and the faintest blush on her cheeks. Rio subtly shoots her a look, but Alice pretends not to notice. And before Rio can say anything, Jen’s already looping an arm through hers and steering her forward. </p><p>“Come on. I saved you the best seat.”</p><p>Rio walks toward her seat, crosses one leg over the other, and squints out at the field. Jen’s voice immediately floats in beside her, but Rio only catches fragments of whatever conversation they’re supposedly having. She still can’t spot Agatha anywhere.</p><p>“I still can’t believe we raised way more money this year than last,” Jen keeps yapping, taking a sip of something bubbly a little too early in the afternoon.</p><p>Rio turns slightly, about to ask what Jen just said when the host steps up to the mic. He welcomes everyone and explains the match is raising money for a youth equestrian program to help those who can’t afford it but dream of becoming professional equestrians: scholarships, training, all that good stuff.</p><p>Then he gets to the real reason everyone’s here: today’s match is thanks to the major patron, Jennifer Kale and the Kale Global Shipping and Trade Conglomerate. Polite claps ripple through the crowd as Jen casually lifts her glass.</p><p>Before Rio knows it, the teams are introduced. Kensington House versus some other team she didn’t even catch, because she’s too distracted by seeing Agatha again. They share a quick look, the Princess softly smiling like one of those kids on the internet whose favorite person eventually showed up to cheer them on. </p><p>Then the umpire rolls the ball between the teams, and the game begins.</p><p>Princess Agatha riding a horse isn’t exactly breaking news for Rio. Even Agatha dressed in full polo gear: helmet strapped, fitted white jodhpurs tucked into knee-high brown boots, leather gloves snug on her hands — shouldn’t be either.</p><p>Even the purple jersey, with its bold number 3 and Kensington House imprinted across the back, should feel familiar. Rio had already seen it before. Both in periodicals and in person. It should be just as mundane as watching paint dry on a sunny day.</p><p>It definitely shouldn’t make her feel anything close to mild heart palpitations, or a low, restless stirring that has her fingers longing to trace the curve of her collarbone.</p><p>But then there’s Agatha, pushing her horse forward, her ass bouncing against the saddle, arms stretching and flexing as she swings that mallet. The way she looks doing it, and what she’s wearing, is almost more than Rio can handle. </p><p>And it doesn’t help that Agatha seems to catch her eye on purpose, probably knowing Rio’s been staring at her even through their matching sleek sunglasses.</p><p>She also has the nerve to flash that smug smile every time she scores, like she’s putting on a show just for Rio. And, truth be told, it’s definitely working. </p><p>The most devastating thing for Rio to admit is that Agatha is damn good. Seriously, really, really good. And Rio’s always been drawn to people who are passionate and totally sure of what they’re doing. That’s exactly what gets to her. What makes her desperately weak in the knees.</p><p>Now, she can’t help but imagine Agatha’s bare ass in her hands, her thighs parting just like when she’s riding, only this time on a bed, with Rio right there between them. </p><p>At some point, she even flips the scene in her head. Her own legs parted, with Agatha right in the middle. Either way, it’s definitely not a polo match she’s thinking about right now.</p><p>It’s crazy how just watching makes the craving coil tighter inside her, primal and urgent, growing louder with every gallop of the horses across the field. After weeks of pushing it down, fighting it, now Rio really wants it. Badly needs it. Fucking desperately.</p><p>The game finally drags to a close after what seems like an endless torture session under the scorching sun. By the time it’s over, Rio feels like she might pass out. Either from the heat beating down on her or from the desperate ache burning between her thighs.</p><p>All she can think about is getting to Agatha. Every inch of her body longs to be close, to touch, to breathe her in. It's all she can think about as she walks down from the stands.</p><p>“I think I’m just gonna slip off and say hi to Agatha,” Rio announces, turning to Alice, who’s still following right behind her. Somehow, Alice gets what Rio means as her eyes widen. The way Rio looks, flushed from the sun more than the others, says it all.</p><p>She tries to come up with a believable excuse for how she’s acting, but even her brain is too scrambled to think straight.</p><p>At least that’s one less thing Rio has to worry about now that Alice’s in the loop. </p><p>What an embarrassingly effective way to break it to her best friend that she’s fucking a Princess. Or, more accurately, that she’s about to.</p><p>“You’ve got a lot to fill me in on,” Alice tells her.</p><p>“I think I could say the same to you,” she replies, nodding toward Jen, who Rio noticed hasn’t taken her eyes off the latter the entire time.</p><p>But before Alice can respond, Rio’s already heading toward the stables, her mind running wild picturing Agatha’s body inching closer to hers.</p><p>“Shit, I’m sorry.” She nearly stops herself from running straight into Agatha, who’s just rounded the corner of the stables.</p><p>“Hi,” the Princess says. And for a moment they just stand there, sizing each other up. Rio looks less like a spectator and more like she’d also been riding the whole match. Agatha breaks the quiet by adding, “I was actually on my way to find you.”</p><p>“Well, hi,” Rio finally says, doing her best to keep it cool. “Looks like you found me.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes lock on Rio’s, and Rio quickly looks away, hoping the Princess didn’t catch her pupils, probably dilating without her even realizing it.</p><p>“You good?” Agatha asks, and from the way she says it, Rio’s pretty sure the other woman knows exactly what is going on within her thoughts.</p><p>“Yes. I’m fine,” Rio says, not wanting to seem rude by dodging the question. Better to play along if she wants this day to go her way, because damn, she badly does. “So, what was it you wanted to show me?” she lies, trying to sound casual but knowing she’s totally not.</p><p>Agatha gives her a slow once-over, that smile undoubtedly confirming Rio’s suspicion that she’s right on the money. She glances around at the sea of wealthy people and socialites passing by, then locks eyes with Rio again. </p><p>“What do you mean?” </p><p>“You said there’s something you need to show me.”</p><p>“There is?” she says teasingly, and Rio’s pretty sure she’s about to swoon right then and there.</p><p>“I’d like to think there is. Isn’t that the whole point of you inviting me?”</p><p>“Oh, right,” Agatha says, dragging out the word like she’s teasing her. “You want to see it now?”</p><p>“Well, it was a two-hour flight, then a twenty-minute drive to get here, and I’ve got to head back to DC in a couple of hours. I’m guessing now’s the best time to show me, don’t you think?” </p><p>Agatha looks around, noting the few people within earshot, then stages a light laugh. One of those polite, princess-like ones meant for public consumption. </p><p>But the smile she gives Rio thereafter feels a little too genuine and warm. </p><p>“Of course,” she tells her, voice dipping just enough to make Rio’s stomach turn. “We wouldn’t want to waste your <em> very </em> precious time, would we?”</p><p>Rio doesn’t bother answering. What’s even the point, when her brain’s already melting? </p><p>Agatha pivots on one polished boot and strides around the back of the stables, slips through a side door without so much as a glance back, and Rio follows after her without so much as a thought.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Rio still remembers the first time she had sex. But not the girl’s name, not her face, not even the stupid festival they ended up at. Just that it was loud, erratic, and somewhere in the middle of a field that smelled like pricey beer and marijuana.</p><p>The girl went to some rival high school and, if Rio remembers correctly, played shortstop annoyingly well. The kind of girl who slid into base like she had a grudge against the dirt.</p><p>Rio despised her. Which, naturally, also meant she wanted her. Apparently, even teenage Rio was already weak for any girl who showed the slightest sign of being good at anything, even a speck of competence. Competence was, and still is, her fucking Achilles’ heel.</p><p>They hooked up behind some half-deflated sponsor tent while some ‘next big thing’ was crooning on stage. Rio’s pretty sure that artist is famous now, but back then, she didn’t care. Especially not when she had someone three fingers deep in her, making her forget how to speak in full sentences, let alone track lyrics.</p><p>She barely remembers the song that was playing while they were doing it. Just fragments of the melody, a ghost of a tune. But now, with Agatha pressed up against her, mouth hot and unforgiving, Rio swears she hears that damn song again. </p><p>Then again, it’s hard to really remember anything when someone’s practically kissing the soul out of your body, especially with Agatha’s lips dragging along her jaw and her knee sliding between her thighs.</p><p>“You haven’t wandered off on me, have you?” Agatha’s voice, low and right against her ear, instantly yanks Rio out of her head like a hook to the gut. Rio’s eyes stay shut as she feels the Princess pull back just enough to look at her, hands still criminally parked on her waist.</p><p>“I have no idea what you mean,” Rio says, her own voice coming out like it missed a step on the way out of her throat. Then she blinks and actually takes in their surroundings. “What in the Fifty Shades of fancy white-people crazy is this place?” </p><p>It’s a cramped, windowless space tucked right beside the stables, stuffed with the rich scent of polished leather and the warm, earthy smell of aged wood. </p><p>The walls are crowded from floor to ceiling with thick, well-used saddles, tangled bridles, worn riding crops, and hefty leather reins hanging in neat rows. On a weathered wooden bench, a few pairs of scuffed riding boots sit side by side, and a dusty metal bucket rests in the corner. </p><p>“What’s the matter? Never been in a tack room before?” Agatha says, and one of her hands slips under Rio’s dress. Rio gasps embarrassingly loud and nearly forgets how to stand. “Oh, you poor thing. If you want something, all you have to do is ask, love.” </p><p>The word lands like a sucker punch to Rio’s sternum. </p><p>Did she fucking hear that right? Did the actual Princess of England just call her that? </p><p>Oh, Jesus tap-dancing Christ.</p><p>Her brain fries on the spot. She had to have misheard. Or maybe it’s just one of those British things, like how Agatha says ‘water’ or how she calls trash ‘rubbish’ with a straight face. Probably just a casual, flirty little throwaway, she thinks. Surely Her Royal Highness hands those out like complimentary mints.</p><p>“I…” Rio tries to speak, but the words get lost somewhere God knows where. Then she makes the mistake of looking at Agatha again. That damn smile. That arrogant, absolutely infuriating smile. Like she had just won something. As if seeing Rio this sweaty, needy, and five seconds from blacking out is some kind of personal achievement. </p><p>Rio wants to disappear. Or punch her. Or kiss her. Perhaps all three. </p><p>“Jesus. You're going to be even more irritatingly smug after this, aren't you?” </p><p>“Only if I can’t help it,” Agatha says, pressing Rio harder against the wall. “Say the word, and I’ll stop right here, right now. Or say the other one…and I won’t.”</p><p>Rio wants to say yes so badly, it’s almost tragic. It’s borderline humiliating how fast her heart is racing, how she’s acutely catching her breath, and how every single nerve in her body seems urgently tuned into Agatha’s frequency.</p><p>She hates how much she wants this. Hates the ache low in her belly, the way her thighs tighten just from the sound of that voice at her ear. But still, she wants that voice to keep saying things that render her legs useless. She wants that hand — God, that hand — to do more than just hover and tease. She wants it all. She wants her. She wants <em> Agatha </em>. </p><p>“What’s the other word?” she finally manages to say. </p><p>Agatha’s lips curl into a smirk. “Please, dearest. Just say <em> please </em>.” </p><p>Rio doesn’t say it right away. Mostly because her mouth seems to have completely forgotten how to work. And partly because she’s still clutching onto the last scraps of her dignity. Agatha might have seen her in situations like this before, but somehow, this feels different. Because Rio looks so obviously, embarrassingly desperate.</p><p>But despite the internal screaming match happening in her head, her body’s already decided for her. She presses herself into the hand beneath her dress instead of pulling away and breathes out, “Please.” It’s ungraceful and stupid and thick enough to choke on. “Please, baby.” </p><p>Agatha’s eyes darken the second that word leaves Rio’s lips. And before she knows it, Agatha spins her around and yanks her off the wall until her whole body crashes into her. Rio’s breath catches. Again, how the hell is someone supposedly so prim and proper this damn strong?</p><p>Agatha leans to her shoulder, her lips brushing the shell of Rio’s ear. “You’re going to have to be very quiet while we do this. This place is practically crawling with reporters. And rich people. And half the bloody staff. We don’t want this ending up anywhere near the tabloids, do we?” </p><p>“Can’t the horses just drown us out?” Rio manages to mutter. </p><p>She feels Agatha’s soft laugh brush against her skin. “You just have to have an answer for everything, don’t you, smarty pants?” Then, without warning, her fingers slip inside Rio. </p><p>“Oh, fuck,” the moan that escapes is raw, loud, and completely involuntary. Panicked, she instantly grabs Agatha’s hand at her waist and clamps her mouth over it to muffle the sound.</p><p>She starts thrusting her hips, desperate to take those royal fingers deeper, and drawing herself closer to the brink. Her moans spill out in ragged waves behind Agatha’s hand, everything tilting dangerously close to knocking her out. “Fuck — Agatha,” she exhales. </p><p>“Next chance we get, I don’t want you to be quiet. I want to hear you fall apart for me. Every sound you make. Every word. Every plea. You’ll be free to moan as loud and desperate as you want, dearest. I want to hear every bit of it.”</p><p>Rio lets out something between a laugh and a gasp, barely keeping herself upright. “Keep talking like that,” she breathes, “and I might actually die right here in your <em> very </em> royal hands.”</p><p>“As much as I’m flattered you think I’m deadly enough to kill you,” Agatha’s smile is pure sin against her skin, “I’d much rather have you come undone in bed, where I can take my sweet time finishing the job.” </p><p>She spins Rio around to face her, then guides her toward a sturdy wooden saddle rack. “And besides, they say it’s pure bad luck for the polo horses to have someone dying in a tack room.”</p><p>Agatha claims her lips again, hungry and demanding, and Rio chokes on a moan — her dignity already left behind somewhere between the saddles and the smell of leather. </p><p>She wonders if Agatha’s as soaked as she is. She definitely hopes so, because whatever this is, it’s absolutely driving her insane.</p><p>Rio goddamn swears she’s going to track down whichever enigmatic ex-girlfriend from boarding school or aristocratic dyke with a master’s in lesbian witchcraft taught Agatha how to do all this, and personally send them an edible arrangement with a handwritten thank-you card.</p><p>Rio’s breath snags in her lungs once again. She really should have seen this coming. Princess Agatha Victoria Eleanor Harkness — second in line to the British throne, first in line to ruin her life — turning out to be one hell of a talented bitch. And Rio, like the absolute dumbass she is, shamelessly enjoying every second of it.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers move ruthlessly inside her, and Rio’s just out here trying not to black out, let alone figure out how she’s ever supposed to return the favor. If she even has the energy left to try. She’s way too far gone, especially with Agatha looking at her like she’s got her right where she wants her (because she does).</p><p>Rio doesn’t even know what kind of muffled sounds are clawing their way out of her anymore. She thinks she heard herself say “more.” She definitely said “harder.” And at least once, she’s pretty sure she muttered a heartfelt “motherfucking bitch” when her legs nearly gave out.</p><p>They’ve only been at it for maybe seven minutes, though time has fully lost all meaning, because her entire existence has boiled down to the press of Agatha’s mouth, the grind of her hips, and the way those fingers are currently rewriting Rio’s sense of goddamn self.</p><p>Seven minutes shouldn’t be long enough to ruin a person, but here she is, one royal hand away from crumbling entirely. </p><p>Agatha leans in, “You’re close, aren’t you?”</p><p>Rio could laugh, if she wasn’t so busy feeling like she might actually die. “I’ve been close since…” her eyes raking over Agatha’s polo jersey, boots, and those jodhpurs that fit her ass like a glove. “Whatever this is,” she pants. “What the hell do you think you’re doing to me?”</p><p>“Only what you begged for, love.” </p><p>There it is again. </p><p>“Okay, I know that’s a very British thing for you to say, and I mean this respectfully, but you really need to stop calling me that,” she lies through her teeth. Huge lie. Massive fucking lie. She absolutely wants Agatha to keep calling her that — and the latter seems to know it, because she just smirks and raises an eyebrow.</p><p>“And for the record,” Rio adds, “we both know I’m just as attractive as you are. I just said exactly what you told me to say. Technically, I didn’t beg. And I don’t think begging should be required.” </p><p>Yeah, okay, maybe Rio begged a little after that. A lot more. On her own accord. Hopelessly. Over and over. Because the next thing she knows, her fingers are clutching Agatha’s back, and she’s burying her face in her shoulder just to stop herself from crying out.</p><p>Rio makes a strangled noise, somewhere between a groan and a laugh, that doesn’t entirely sound like her as she crashes back down to earth from that mind-blowing, out-of-this-world orgasm Agatha just gave her. </p><p>“You’re enjoying this, aren’t you?”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t let her go, just keeps brushing Rio’s hair back like she hasn’t just single-handedly, temporarily shut down her entire nervous system in a tack room in the heart of fancy, bougie Wellington, Florida. </p><p>Her chuckle is low and dripping with smug amusement. </p><p>“Watching America’s most beloved darling fall apart in my arms?” she quips, then adds, “This is exactly the kind of thing kings and queens should be bragging about.”</p><p>Rio’s heart is still doing laps in her chest, and her knees are actively voting to become theoretical. She sinks back against the tack trunk behind her, head lolling slightly, trying to string together a sentence, a thought, or maybe even a prayer.</p><p>Instead, all she can say is a breathless, “I think I hate you even more now.” </p><p>Agatha slides down beside her, settling close enough that Rio can feel the heat radiating off her too. She props her elbow on her knee, resting her head on her hand like she’s admiring a piece of fine art. She watches Rio with that slow, soft, satisfied smile. </p><p>“You’re a disaster.” </p><p>Rio scoffs, still trying to catch her breath. “Yeah? And whose fault is that?” She means it to come out all egoistic and snarky — until she sees the look Agatha is giving her. Way too soft and way too fond. She swallows. “Just...give me a minute, and I’ll gladly return the favor.”</p><p>Agatha huffs a laugh through her nose. “You don’t have to.”</p><p>“What’s that supposed to mean?” Rio lifts a brow, crossing her arms like she’s ready to throw hands. “You think I couldn’t possibly meet your royal standards?”</p><p>“Oh, I have no doubt you could,” Agatha says easily. “But I do still have a speech to give, and it won’t be long before someone will notice I’m missing and come looking for me.”</p><p>“You don’t think I could get you off before that happens?”</p><p>Agatha laughs again, which definitely isn’t helping Rio’s still-fluttering heart. “I’d love to see you try,” she says, leaning in just a little. “But I’d rather you do it in Rome.”</p><p>Rio blinks. That shuts her up, briefly. “Rome? Why would we be doing it in Rome?”</p><p>She sees Agatha hesitate for a second before answering. “There’s an opening this week, a joint UK-Italy art exhibition. Some kind of cultural event, I guess, since the monarchy suddenly decided we care about international relations, or at least want to look like we do. I’ll be there to represent the Crown. Thought maybe you’d want to come with me.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t answer right away. Though she already likes the idea of Italy. It's been too long since she was last there, and she’s always sworn it’s one of the places she wants to visit as often as possible. But just as quickly, her mind jumps to the PR angle and what kind of excuse she could spin to fit it into her schedule. </p><p>She finally asks, “And what exactly would I be representing?”</p><p>She catches that little smile in Agatha’s eyes, like she’s amused by how obvious Rio is being. “Well, since an official vacation’s pretty much off the table because of your mom’s campaign, I took the liberty of asking William if there’s any event in Italy someone like you could actually attend. One that just coincidentally happens to line up with mine,” she explains.</p><p>Before she can finish, Rio cuts in, “Wait, the kid knows about us?”</p><p>Judging by Agatha’s face, it’s clearly not that big a deal to her that someone else knows.</p><p>“Yes, he knows. But it’s only him. And maybe Jimmy,” Agatha says, then somehow catches the flash of panic that crosses Rio’s face, because she adds, “He’s my equerry. Also doubles as my private secretary. It’s quite literally his job to be in the loop about my life. And frankly, it’s just more convenient that he knows about…this.”</p><p>Rio, once again, doesn’t say anything right away. Mostly because, annoyingly, Agatha is right. It is Billy who holds her schedule, manages her meetings, her appearances, basically her whole damn life. If anyone needs to know about Agatha’s affairs, like when she’s sneaking off to press Rio against the nearest flat surface, it’s definitely him.</p><p>Still, Rio almost laughs at the word ‘affairs.’ Because honestly, what else is she supposed to call this? The truth is, they haven’t slapped a name on whatever this is. Haven’t drawn any lines. Or maybe there aren’t any. </p><p>Because it’s all just...abstract.</p><p>She sneaks a glance at Agatha, who’s pretending to fuss with her boots but is clearly watching her from the corner of her eye. </p><p>Yeah, definitely abstract.</p><p>“Alright,” Rio says, trying to steer the conversation back. “So what’s this event Billy found for me that just happens to line up with yours?”</p><p>Agatha turns to her. “It’s an international fundraiser for wildlife conservation at some hotel about half an hour from Villa Wolkonsky, where I’ll be staying. But I can have William arrange a private villa just outside the city for us to stay in for a few days, after the official events. Only if you decide to come, of course.”</p><p>Rio gradually starts to see how Billy comes in handy. Wonder if Alice’s like that for her, too? Well, technically, she always has been. Rio knows Alice would move mountains if she asked. Surely, she would help her ass get to Italy for a booty call.</p><p>Rio sighs, trying not to look like a dog begging for another treat after just getting plenty. </p><p>“Okay, I’ll see if I can get out of whatever’s booked for me this week.”</p><p>Agatha smiles that damn annoying, smug smile again. </p><p>“And just a few minutes ago, you said you hated me even more now,” she mocks, clearly enjoying how easy it is to crack Rio, even if she won’t admit it. </p><p>“Doesn’t change a thing, Princess. I still hate you,” Rio argues, trying to keep her own smile at bay, but the smile seemed to be winning. </p><p>“Glad we’re clear on that.”</p><p>And somehow Rio totally blows her own argument by yanking Agatha into another long, slow kiss, followed by another, and another, and another, until she stops caring about the time or anything else but that.</p><hr /><p>Rio looks down at the bracelet Agatha put on her wrist as they sneak out through the back gate toward her waiting car. It was handmade by that kid Nicky, the cheerful little guy from the children’s center they visited months ago in London. Feels like yesterday, though, the way she and Agatha got shoved into that storage room like a couple of misfit toys.</p><p>And now she can’t believe she’s actually on a plane to freaking Italy. How the hell did she let things get to this point? That thought’s still running through her head when Alice plops down next to her and says exactly what she’s thinking.</p><p>“I can’t believe we’re flying all the way to Italy just so you can get laid.”</p><p>Rio shoots her a look and checks around to make sure no one is listening.</p><p>“I’m not flying to Italy to get laid. I’m going to a fundraiser.” </p><p>“You’re supposed to be at a fundraiser. In Silver Spring. Not freaking Rome.”</p><p>“Hey, you were the one going on about how I needed to step up my international profile, make connections outside my usual circle. Well, that’s exactly what I’m doing,” Rio says, then lowers her voice. “And you’re also the one who said the ball’s in my court with Agatha. And guess what? We’ve been tossing that thing back and forth, and now I’m bringing it back to her.”</p><p>Alice doesn’t answer right away. Instead, she gives Rio that look. The one that says she’s trying to be a supportive friend but is already stressing about how she’s supposed to explain all this if it blows up. And Rio gets it. Whatever this thing with Agatha is, if it ever gets out, it’ll probably blow up way bigger than it should.</p><p>“As your friend, I’m thrilled for you. Really. Of course I’m rooting for this. Over the moon that you’re getting railed by actual royalty,” Alice declares. “But as the person who manages your schedule, your security, and does damage control every time something hits the press, I’m just begging you to chill on the surprise trips. Especially since you and HRH Agatha aren’t official to the public, technically. Unless…you want it to be?” </p><p>“What?” Rio doesn’t miss a beat. “God, no. That’s...definitely not on the table.” </p><p>Alice gives her a look, then shrugs. “Okay. Whatever you say. Just, no more surprises, please. Because Lilia and Maria are going to skin me alive the second they start piecing together what you’ve really been up to. Or more accurately...who you’ve been up to.”</p><p>Rio leans her head back against the seat, watching the clouds smear past the small window. “Alright, alright,” she groans. “Fine. We’ll work on it. Me and Agatha, I mean. We’ll try to keep things a little less...impromptu. No more spontaneous trips like this without at least giving my poor, overworked, tragically single head of security a heads-up.”</p><p>“Tragically single?” Alice snorts. “Since when did you get so rude?”</p><p>“Well, it’s true, isn’t it?” Rio says, shooting her a side glance. “Unless, of course, you wanna tell me what’s going on with you and Jen?”</p><p>“What about me and Jen?”</p><p>“You know damn well what I’m talking about.”</p><p>Alice rolls her eyes, and sighs. “It was one date. Just one. Nothing juicy there.”</p><p>Rio raises both eyebrows, genuinely surprised. </p><p>“You went on a date with her and didn’t think to tell me sooner?”</p><p>“Funny you mention that, considering you also kept your thing with Princess Agatha under wraps until just now,” Alice retorts. And seeing she has a point, Rio lets the discussion drop.</p><p>They land in Rome a few hours after Agatha, who, pretty conveniently, is already waiting by the Trevi Fountain. The place is crawling with tourists juggling melting gelato cones, snapping photos, and pretending not to notice the swarm of security detail hovering nearby. </p><p>Agatha’s standing just off-center from the main crowd, where the afternoon sun bounces off the fountain’s glittering water and casting a soft glow over her like she belongs in a painting. There’s also some kind of music playing nearby that fits the whole scene perfectly. </p><p>Rio wants nothing more than to kiss her right then and there. Instead, she slides up beside her, sunglasses on, arms crossed, and mutters from the corner of her mouth, “Subtle. Real subtle.”</p><p>They make their way to a nearby café, both their security teams posted just outside. The story they’ll tell later is that this is a total coincidence, a casual follow-up to Rio’s surprise appearance at the polo club in Florida that had everyone buzzing online.</p><p>That way, the press already has a story to run with, and they won’t bother digging around for the next few days while Rio stays at the private villa Agatha had Billy arrange for them.</p><p>This public meetup was also actually Billy’s idea, or so Agatha told Rio. The kid apparently said something along the lines of — </p><p>“Being seen together in public like this is unlikely to raise any particular suspicions. It’ll seem entirely innocuous. Just two friends spending time together during official engagements, in a perfectly casual, public setting. Harmless, understated, and unremarkable. Precisely the kind of narrative no one feels the need to question.”</p><p>Rio can’t help but admit the kid’s good at his job, and he’s spot on. After all, the press already frames them as best friends, so two women sitting together at a café isn’t anything unusual. </p><p>As long as they don’t stare into each other’s eyes too long or hold hands in public, anyway. Not that Rio thinks they’ll be doing the latter anytime soon…or ever. She reminds herself of that every time her mind starts wandering down that road.</p><p>Rio twirls her fork through the pasta, taking little looks at Agatha, who’s sitting all proper with her tea, pinky out and cup lifted just so. “There’s something I’ve been dying to ask you,” she asks. </p><p>“Hmm,” Agatha looks up at her. “Let me guess, you’re wondering which other famous girls and daughters of world leaders I’ve managed to shag?”</p><p>Rio bursts out laughing, shaking her head. </p><p>“On second thought, there are now <em> two </em> things I’ve been dying to ask you.”</p><p>Agatha leans back, amused. “Okay then, why don’t you start with the easy one.”</p><p>Rio twirls her fork, thinking. “What’s the weirdest thing someone’s ever assumed about you?”</p><p>Agatha takes a slow sip of her tea. “That I’m some cold-hearted bitch who never laughs.”</p><p>Rio lets out a guilty little laugh of her own, because she’s definitely thought of that herself. But now she knows how wrong she was, because Agatha <em> laughs </em>, and it turns out her laugh might just be one of those sounds Rio could listen to repeatedly and never get tired of.</p><p>“Well, aside from that,” she says, shoving the thought back down.</p><p>Agatha rests her cup on the table and deadpans, “That I bathe in rosewater infused with 24-karat gold flakes and use crushed pearls to exfoliate every morning.”</p><p>Rio nearly chokes laughing, thinking how utterly ridiculous that sounds, then remembers some of the wild things she’s heard about other rich white royals around the world. </p><p>She raises an eyebrow. “And do you?”</p><p>Agatha tilts her head, eyes sparkling with mock innocence. “Do I what?” she purrs.</p><p>“Bathe in rosewater with gold and crushed pearls?”</p><p>She takes a slow, deliberate sip, never breaking their eye contact. Then, with a meaningful, sultry smile, Agatha says, “Well, dearest, that’s for you to find out.”</p><p>Somehow, Rio makes it through the fundraiser without combusting from the mental image of Agatha bathing in rosewater and gold like some kind of aristocratic nymph. It’s ridiculous. It’s insane. It’s way too rich-people-core. </p><p>But now it’s stuck in her head, and for reasons she’s not proud of, it’s not even the worst visual. </p><p>She realizes she’s never actually seen Agatha naked. Then it hits her. Agatha hasn’t seen her naked either. But then she thinks again: does she even want to? Does she even think about it? </p><p>But all of that becomes less of a hypothetical and more of a very real situation when they finally arrive at the private villa. Just the two of them, drunk off two bottles of wine and a one-hour drive out of the city, filled with barely restrained glances and even less restrained leg-touching. </p><p>They tumble into one of the bedrooms, flushed and breathless, laughing like idiots at everything and nothing all at once. “You sure it’s just the two of us in here?” Rio asks, clicking the lock shut behind them as her hand casually snakes up to cradle Agatha’s neck. She’s drunk, and Agatha’s mouth is dangerously soft, and somehow, it all feels so damn electric.</p><p>Agatha tilts her head into Rio’s hand, fingers sliding low to grip her ass. </p><p>“Quite sure it’s just us,” she purrs. “Why?”</p><p>“Nothing. I just don’t wanna traumatize anyone with what’s about to happen,” Rio says under her breath, grabbing Agatha by the waist and walking her backward until her legs bump the edge of the bed. She gives her a gentle push, and Agatha drops onto the mattress with that smug little look that makes Rio’s pulse skip.</p><p>Agatha’s hands find her hips and pull her in until Rio’s properly straddling her lap. The kiss that follows is anything but sweet. It’s messy, open-mouthed, all heat and teeth and quiet groans, like they’ve both been waiting all day to get here.</p><p>Rio still can’t believe how right this feels. It doesn’t make any damn sense. It shouldn’t feel this easy, this electric, but somehow, it does. </p><p>It’s something about the energy they’re feeding each other. Agatha burns, slow, controlled, and consuming in the way she touches and holds. While Rio moves like a tide, all water, restless, surging, and impossible to pin down. But instead of putting each other out, they rise. Like steam off something that was always meant to boil. And somehow, they just work.</p><p>Somewhere in between, Rio manages to change their positions, and now it’s Agatha straddling her. She grinds down into Rio’s lap, a breathy grunt escaping as her soaked core drags against her thigh, and in response, Rio swears into her mouth, surrendering to the pull and slide, and just drowning in the intoxicating sweetness of Agatha’s lips.</p><p>Agatha’s hands come up to cradle Rio’s face, and Rio immediately melts under the touch, her fingers tightening around Agatha’s waist, anchoring her like she might drift away with a single breath. She feels Agatha smile against her lips. “Still here, sweetheart. I’m not going anywhere.” </p><p>Rio kisses Agatha like there’s no air left to breathe. Like stopping might knock the world off its axis and send all the oxygen spilling out. </p><p>Her hands roam beneath the soft fabric of Agatha’s dress, fingertips brushing over warm skin until the dress slips off her shoulders and pools around her waist. Even stripped bare — no, especially stripped bare — Agatha looks like she’s been carved out of a dream, a damn Renaissance painting come to life. Rio swears she feels her pupils dilate at the sight. </p><p>“Fuck,” Rio breathes. “I’m not sure this applies right now, but God save the Queen.”</p><p>Agatha snorts, low and unladylike. “Oh, I certainly hope not,” she mutters under her breath. But before Rio can even ask what she means, Agatha’s already making short work of her buttons, stripping her down. Rio tries not to look too impressed, but it’s hard. </p><p>Of course Agatha’s terribly good with her hands. Of course she can strip someone with the same elegance she probably uses to play piano or swing a mallet.</p><p>Rio should probably say something witty, but all she can manage is a breath and the thought that somehow, getting undressed by a literal princess feels both terrifying and weirdly sacred. So, she just sits there, half-naked and fully in awe, wondering how the hell she got so lucky and why the hell she feels so breathless just watching her.</p><p>Agatha gently pushes Rio’s back against the bed, then settles herself above her, one thigh slipping smoothly between Rio’s legs. Her hands brace on the pillows beside her head, and every point where they touch sparks like fucking electricity. The soft lamp light makes Agatha look almost otherworldly, and Rio can’t help but drink her in even more.</p><p>Somewhere in the back of her mind, that song from the music festival years ago starts playing faintly again, and she makes a mental note to finally find out what the fuck it is.</p><p>Agatha, hovering over, cuts through her daze. “Are you just gonna keep gawking at me all night?” she teases, and that’s all Rio needs to gently pull her down by the hair into another deep and hungry kiss. Then Agatha’s mouth slides down to the side of Rio’s neck, right under her ear, leaving a trail of kisses before flashing a wicked grin and baring her teeth.</p><p>“Hope you don’t have an issue with this,” whispers Agatha. “Something tells me you won’t mind a little signature.” Rio knows that bite is gonna leave a mark. A glaring violation in the unspoken rulebook for secret hookups between high-profile people. But she’s way past caring.</p><p>She feels Agatha’s fingers finding the top of her trousers, popping the button, dragging the zipper down, and tugging at the band of her underwear, until everything is suddenly off and Rio’s skin hits the air. Her brain’s foggy now, too far gone to think straight. </p><p>She then opens her eyes just in time to catch Agatha’s mouth on her chest, right between her breasts, before her lips wrap around one, making Rio clutch the sheets.</p><p>“If you don’t stop teasing and get your fingers inside me already, then yes, Your Highness, we’re heading straight for some serious issues,” Rio says, hearing Agatha chuckle against her skin.</p><p>Agatha moves up from Rio’s chest back to her face, getting close enough to whisper. “Just so we’re clear, you do know that I outrank you, right?” She nibbles softly at Rio’s ear. </p><p>Rio bites back a whimper. How had Agatha gotten this kind of hold on her already?</p><p>“It's been brought up once or twice,” she admits. </p><p>“Right. I outrank you, Miss Vidal. I outrank you in more ways than one,” Agatha repeats slowly, as if savoring every word. She leans in closer, her mouth just shy of Rio’s. “So here’s what you’re going to do. You’re going to kiss me while I fuck you with my fingers. And you’re going to remember exactly who calls the shots here. Do we have an understanding?” </p><p>Rio huffs out a breath, half-laugh, half-resigned disbelief. “I’ve got a feeling I’m going to regret agreeing to this.” Then she complies, cupping Agatha’s face with both hands and kissing her hard. If she’s going down, she’s going down swinging.</p><p>Rio feels Agatha press in closer, her chest pressing harder against hers until their heartbeats start racing in sync. Agatha’s fingers hover just at Rio’s entrance, teasing with the slightest touch as they briefly break the kiss. Then she looks Rio dead in the eyes, and damn, Rio’s mind goes totally haywire, catching that same hungry fire burning right back at her.</p><p>“Fuck, you’re just so ready for me, aren’t you, dearest?” she hears Agatha say and Rio can’t believe in all her wildest dreams she’d hear that from a princess. Her fingers keep circling teasingly, making Rio squirm beneath her touch.</p><p>“Shit, Agatha, please,” Rio pants, arching her back off the bed. Just months ago, she wanted to punch Agatha for being so damn infuriating. And now here she is, the one about to get knocked out, and suffering deliciously. “Inside me now, or I swear, I’ll make you regret making me wait.”</p><p>She hears Agatha’s soft laugh again before she pushes in slowly, inch by inch, feeling Rio’s heat wrap around her fingers. Even with her eyes closed, Rio can feel Agatha watching her, reading the pleasure in every twitch of her muscles, and every hitch of her breath. </p><p>“Fuck,” she gasps when Agatha is fully inside and starts moving, fingers curling upward, hunting for that one spot guaranteed to wreck whatever scrap of composure Rio has left.</p><p>She plunges in fast and deep, ripping a loud groan from Rio’s lips. “God, yes,” she moans, as Agatha’s palm starts grinding against her clit with every thrust. </p><p>At some point, unclear when, her hands find Agatha’s hips, gripping tight, dragging her down and begging for more. “Agatha, fuck, I think I’m gonna…shit, I’m gonna —” she pushes herself up, buries her face against Agatha’s shoulder to muffle the sound about to come out. </p><p>“No, sweetheart. Let me hear you,” Agatha purrs, her pace picking up. And Rio does. She screams. Actually screams. A raw, helpless sound she didn’t even know her body could make, as the orgasm finally crashes over her, all heat and pressure and pulsing release. </p><p>She can feel it around Agatha’s fingers, and she barely has time to catch her breath before she feels Agatha grinding against her thigh, chasing her own pleasure.</p><p>Rio crashes back against the bed, chest heaving, skin slick with sweat. She looks at Agatha, who’s grinning like she just won the damn lottery, sliding her fingers out of Rio and bringing them to her lips. She licks them clean, eyes never leaving Rio’s.</p><p>Rio watches her, breath shaky. “Jesus, Agatha…that was —” She doesn’t even finish the sentence, but Agatha clearly gets the thought. She leans down and kisses her like a woman who knows exactly what she just did, letting Rio taste herself on her tongue.</p><p>When they finally pull apart, Rio’s eyes are half-lidded, her chest still rising and falling like she's just run a mile. Agatha settles back beside her, giving Rio a second to catch her breath. </p><p>Rio tilts her head back and takes in the ornate ceiling above them. An elaborate mosaic of cherubs lounging on clouds, and frozen in time. She can’t stop herself from imagining her and Agatha, naked beneath the covers, immortalized in one of those grand old paintings. </p><p>The thought nearly makes her laugh. Just imagine how the whole world would completely lose its mind if that ever saw the light of day. </p><p>She feels Agatha shift and follows with, “If only the American public knew all it took to shut you up was a good fuck, I’m pretty sure they’d have been begging me to do this ages ago.”</p><p>Rio laughs, breath still shaky. “Oh, fuck you,” she cries, but she’s already crawling on top of Agatha, using whatever energy she’s got left. She bends down, her lips dragging slowly over Agatha’s chest, and under her mouth, she feels the little jump in Agatha’s heartbeat as she realizes what Rio is about to do. “My turn now,” she says against her skin. “I’ve honestly been wondering how a British princess sounds when she’s the one doing the begging.”</p><p>Agatha’s the quiet one now, eyes locked on Rio as she hooks her fingers into the waistband of her underwear and slowly slides it down, trailing soft kisses along her thigh as she goes. </p><p>Rio can’t help but think back to that time she saw Agatha barefoot in Kensington Palace: unguarded and so human in a way she wasn’t supposed to be. </p><p>And now she’s here, spread out in bed with Rio, completely bare and wanting her. It’s almost ridiculous how surreal this feels. Like the universe got extremely drunk and decided to hand her this moment. And it’s kind of blowing Rio’s mind.</p><p>“Should I get used to you gawking at me every time we do this?” Agatha teases, and Rio blinks, snapping out of her daze again. Then she just grins, and answers by kissing her way lower. By the time her warm breath reaches Agatha’s center, she hears her gasp, “Oh…fucking hell,” hips twitching, as Rio’s tongue finally touches her.</p><p>“Spread your legs for me, baby,” she says, parting her with both hands before dipping her head, tongue sliding in deep and slow. The taste of her sends a shared moan escaping from both their lips at once. “Jesus, I still can’t believe I’m actually allowed to touch you like this.” </p><p>Rio wants to ruin her. Wants to make that clipped British composure melt into a fucking puddle. And judging by the way Agatha’s hips jerk under her mouth, it’s already working. Rio’s tongue moves deep, slow at first, then faster, tasting every bit of Agatha like she’s been starving for it. She licks, sucks, flicks her tongue just so to discover what makes the Princess gasp and moan.</p><p>She looks up, mouth still on Agatha, and catches her stare before Agatha drops her head back onto the pillow, hands fisting the sheets, and lets out a wrecked, “Rio, please.”</p><p>That cracks something open in Rio. She loves it, though she’d never admit it, when Agatha drops all those soft little pet names that twist her stomach into knots. But hearing her say <em> her name </em> like that. Like a prayer. Like a desperate plea. Breathless, begging, and completely undone. It makes Rio want to give her absolutely everything. </p><p>“Please what, Your Highness?” </p><p>“Please…don’t make me beg twice,” Agatha speaks, her breath weak yet assertive.</p><p>“Beg for what?”</p><p>Agatha’s blue eyes flare with frustration as they lock onto Rio’s teasing brown ones. She draws a breath and adds, “Rio, I do swear…you’re positively driving me quite mad.”</p><p>“I just want to hear you say it, baby,” Rio’s grin grows wider. “Just say it.”</p><p>Agatha bites her lip, then whispers, “Oh, Rio.” </p><p>“Yes, Your Highness?” Rio’s eyes searching hers.</p><p>But just when Rio believes she’s about to hear the Princess begging for more, Agatha’s ocean eyes darken, and instead of sweet words, she says —</p><p>“Be a good American girl and learn how the Crown likes to come.”</p><p>Without wasting another second, Rio obeys, and honestly, she might kick herself later for how fast she falls in line with Agatha’s command. It’s rough and fast, and Agatha’s swearing like crazy, but now it’s mixed with little bits of praise that somehow make it even hotter. </p><p>Hearing Agatha say “That’s it,” “You’re doing so great, dearest,” “Just like that,” and “Don’t stop, don’t you fucking stop,” does something to Rio. Knowing she’s the one pulling those sounds from Agatha, the one making her take control while still seeming to lose it all at once. It’s hot as hell. And it makes Rio want to give Agatha even more to lose herself in.</p><p>Agatha’s legs finally clamp tight around Rio’s head, shaking. Jesus, Rio thinks, not slowing down as she keeps licking her through it, chasing every last pulse of her orgasm. If this is what royalty tastes like, she might just stay on Agatha’s knees forever.</p><p>Rio rolls over onto her back, keeping a little space between them as they both stare up at the ceiling. She steals a glance at Agatha from the corner of her eye, watching her breathe hard, all flushed and quiet, and wonders what the hell is going through that royal head of hers. </p><p>Hopefully not regret or disappointment. </p><p>But judging by that last scream, though, Rio figures she probably did alright. She lets out a short laugh and says, “Bet no one back home’s ever had you screaming like an American girl can.”</p><p>Rio barely finishes her sentence before she hears Agatha’s soft laugh. She then turns her head just in time to catch the tiny smirk tugging at the corners of Agatha’s lips, like she’s trying not to look too pleased with herself, or with Rio. </p><p>“Let’s not have it go straight to your big American head,” Agatha replies dryly, turning to look Rio right in the eye. </p><p>And as their gazes lock, Rio can’t help but think how outlandish, unorthodox, and honestly kind of amazing it is to see Agatha this unguarded, so open, and beautifully real.</p><p>Agatha leans in close across the pillow, pressing a soft, slow kiss to Rio’s lips. The gentleness of it makes Rio remind herself not to read too much into it or get caught up in the moment.</p><p>The Princess then pulls back with a sly smile. “Well, I do hope all that running you do back in DC has got you fit enough, because I’m more than ready for another round, if you are.”</p><p>And what follows is hours of messy, indulgent sin. </p><p>There’s French involved, not the language, but the kind that’s all teeth, tongue, and breathless little sighs. There’s also moaning, swearing, and a whole lot of laughter that turns into groaning when someone bites too hard. At some point, the room ends up smelling like sweat, sex, and expensive perfume soaked into the bedspread. And somewhere in the middle of all that, Rio forgets they were supposed to be sleeping in separate bedrooms.</p><p>She wakes up the next morning to sunlight pouring through the giant-ass windows and finds the other side of the massive bed empty. </p><p>Turns out, Princess Agatha is an early riser. Not exactly shocking, but still, annoyingly on brand.</p><p>Rio groans as she drags herself out of bed, grabbing the soft white robe crumpled at the foot. She slips it on and pads barefoot into the hallway, still half-convinced last night was some kind of champagne-fueled dream. </p><p>Where the hell is Agatha? </p><p>There’s music playing somewhere in the villa, something familiar, though Rio can’t still quite place it. She hears it as soon as she steps into the living room. And now that it’s morning and her brain isn’t swimming in champagne, she actually notices how stupidly beautiful the place is.</p><p>It’s all old-school Italian charm, with arched doorways, warm terracotta walls, polished stone flooring, lush green velvet upholstery, gold accent throughout, and thick draperies swaying with the breeze. There is also a slight scent of lavender and citrus in the air. </p><p>But no Agatha. </p><p>She steps out onto the patio, squinting against the sunlight, and slows when she sees the table by the pool. There’s a full-on breakfast spread laid out: hot coffee, tea, toast, eggs, fresh fruit, and a stack of pastries. Two place settings. One of them has a folded napkin pinned down with a little jar of jam and a silver butter knife.</p><p>But she still can’t find Agatha anywhere. </p><p>She keeps searching the house, and while doing so, her mind just won’t let go of last night’s memory. It’s wild to think the woman she once barely tolerated just gave her the best sex of her life. But it’s not just that. What stays with Rio is the softness underneath it all.</p><p>
  <em> Baby, you're like lightning in a bottle… </em>
</p><p>Between all the laughing and teasing last night, Rio recalls how gently Agatha tucked her hair behind her ear, as well as those sweet, gentle kisses she planted right where her hands gripped hard or her mouth pressed harder. It’s almost ridiculous how romantic it all felt. </p><p>
  <em> I can't let you go now that I got it… </em>
</p><p>Still, no Agatha.</p><p>Rio continues to meander through the villa, her bare feet padding on the cool stone floors. Then, just as she’s about to give up the search, the music in the living room suddenly becomes louder, more apparent, and utterly recognizable. </p><p>
  <em> And all I need is to be struck… </em>
</p><p>The same song she heard at that random music festival ten years ago. The one that’s been playing on a loop in her head lately, almost every time she thinks of Agatha. The same melody that lingers when she remembers their kiss in the stables, when she sees Agatha waiting by the Trevi Fountain, and now, wrapped up in every soft, electrifying memory from last night.</p><p>
  <em> By your electric love… </em>
</p><p>“Oh, good morning, dearest,” comes a soft voice from behind her.</p><p>
  <em> Baby, your electric love… </em>
</p><p>Rio turns, and for a moment, everything just…slows. Literally fucking slows. </p><p>Like everything else just suddenly fades into obscurity, leaving only Agatha in focus. </p><p>Standing there in a robe that matches Rio’s, hair slightly messy, glasses perched on her nose, a book tucked under one arm, and somehow a little too beautiful for this hour. The sight is almost painfully domestic, warm, and so unexpected that Rio feels her mouth part slightly, stupidly so.</p><p>“I hope you're hungry,” she adds, and Rio still can’t quite process what she’s looking at.</p><p>Because what really gets her is the way Agatha is looking at her. Like all the walls are down. Like Rio’s seeing that younger version of Agatha people keep saying disappeared for a long time. And somehow, she’s the one lucky enough to catch it, which hits Rio harder than any kiss ever could.</p><p>And in an unexpected glimpse of obvious, indisputable truth, Rio can’t believe she ever convinced and fooled herself into thinking she hated Agatha. </p><p>Because right here, right now, with all this frightening vivid clarity, it’s so damn obvious that maybe, just maybe — she’s slowly, unreasonably, and inevitably falling for the Princess.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Rio takes the butter knife and goes for the fancy little pot of jam: some bougie fig-orange blend she still isn’t sure she actually likes or just tolerates out of sheer hunger. Either way, she smears it on bread like a woman who hasn’t eaten in days. Which, honestly, checks out, considering how many calories she and Agatha burned last night. At one point, she’s pretty sure she saw God, then blacked out for a solid fifteen seconds before coming to and begging for more.</p><p>But she doesn’t let herself spiral down that train of thought. She’s hungry. Stupid hungry. Like, could-eat-an-actual-chair hungry. She could probably inhale the whole breakfast spread, if Agatha didn’t look so unfairly breathtaking just sitting there. Legs crossed perfectly, those glasses perched like she’s some kind of bookish goddess, completely absorbed in a book with <b> <em>Poems and Fragments</em> </b> emblazoned on the cover. </p><p>Wait. Is she actually reading Sappho? Rio’s mind does a double take as she watches Agatha act like she hasn’t noticed Rio staring at her like a total creep for the last five minutes.</p><p>Then, out of nowhere, still not even looking up from her damn book, Agatha goes, “You’re not freaking out about any of this, are you?” Her voice dips into this exaggerated American drawl, like she’s practically air-quoting the question. And Rio almost chokes on her toast.</p><p>“Freaking out?” Rio coughs, grabs her orange juice, and takes a dramatic gulp like she’s trying to wash the panic down with pulp. “Freaking out about what, exactly?”</p><p>Agatha flips a page, completely unbothered. “About last night, obviously.”</p><p>Rio almost chokes again. “What? No. I’m not freaking out about that. Please.” She laughs a little too fast, a little too loud, then a sudden pause. “Are…are you freaking out?”</p><p>There’s a beat. Agatha finishes the sentence, or more accurately, the verse she’s on, then finally sets the book down beside her plate with that slow, infuriating grace she always seems to have. </p><p>And then she looks right at Rio. Calm as hell. Cool as ever.</p><p>“No,” she says plainly. “Is there a reason I should be?” </p><p>Rio looks across at Agatha and her brain throws her back to that convoluted, dangerous thought she just had earlier. Perhaps she’s actually catching feelings for this woman. An affection so strange and impossible to pin down, it’s like trying to describe the color of a dream. And isn’t that a fucking catastrophe just waiting to happen?</p><p>They did agree to keep things exactly as they were. Agatha acts like she’s above it all, and Rio pretends to hate her for it. That same old game of acting like they get on each other’s nerves, or at least, that’s the script Rio’s sticking to. </p><p>So why is her brain — or more stupidly, her emotionally illiterate heart, that dumb overachieving pump in the middle of her chest — making things feel so fucking weird now?</p><p>Or maybe it’s just the insanely good sex. The kind that leaves you dizzy and a little stupid. </p><p>Yeah, that’s all it is. That’s got to be it. </p><p>Rio is just being human. These kinds of weird, confusing thoughts are totally normal for a red-blooded human who just had the best orgasm of her life. The best sex of her life. </p><p>Not that she’d ever admit that to Agatha. God, no. That goes straight into the vault. But she definitely wants it again. She definitely wants to have that best-sex-of-her-life again. Maybe like...until further notice. So no, there is absolutely zero point in turning this into a whole thing.</p><p>“No,” she says, only realizing after that there’s been a long pause since Agatha asked.</p><p>“Brilliant,” Agatha replies, already dumping pistachios and pumpkin seeds into her yogurt, followed by a couple of spoonfuls of muesli and some raspberries. Rio watches her, struck by how utterly English Agatha is. </p><p>Then, almost against her will, Rio notices how strangely sweet and pleasant it feels to be here like this, to just sit together, having breakfast like..well, not exactly a couple, because Rio wouldn’t dare call them that. But more like two equally busy people on some fancy-ass vacation, pretending the world outside doesn’t exist.</p><p>Agatha must feel Rio staring, because she finally looks up and says, “Would you like some muesli? It’s surprisingly decent. I personally told William to have it ready this morning.”</p><p>Rio shakes her head. “No, I’m good with toast and…whatever this jam is.” She pauses, then squints at the table. “Wait, the kid did all this?”</p><p>Agatha nods, thoughtfully swirling her yogurt. “Yes. I had William sort everything out. He came by earlier with a few staff from Wolkonsky.” She pauses, then lifts her eyes to Rio with pinpoint accuracy. “Wait. Is that why you’ve been gawping at me? Did you actually think I whipped this up myself?”</p><p>Rio chokes again on absolutely nothing. Her face betrays her before she even gets the chance to lie. Jesus Christ. She actually, embarrassingly, thought Agatha made breakfast for them. Like some kind of royal domestic fantasy. </p><p>But before she can even start defending herself, Agatha seems to clock it instantly and leans back in her chair. “Dearest,” she drawls, the pet name sliding off her tongue like it’s been there for years, “hate to break it to you, but I can’t even fry an egg without setting off a fire alarm.”</p><p>Rio goes a little red. “Oh please. I can’t even picture you cracking one.” Then, out of nowhere, another random thought crosses her mind: Has Agatha ever done this before? Brought other women to some private villa, fucked all night, and then chilled over breakfast like this? </p><p>She isn’t that very interested, though. Alright, perhaps she is a bit interested. Who wouldn’t be at least a tiny bit curious about who else the Princess has, as she so delightfully phrased it last time, <em> shagged </em>? But Rio’s way too professional to actually ask that. </p><p>It’s ridiculous she’s even thinking about asking. Jesus. </p><p>What she should be doing is setting some damn rules. Whatever this thing is between them, it needs rules. Some kind of boundary-setting treaty. </p><p>She tosses a grape in her mouth, chews like she’s buying time, then finally goes, “Okay. Now that we’re at least halfway dressed and not being bossed around by our horny little goblin brains, I feel like we should maybe set some rules. Just basic ones. For whatever this is.”</p><p>Agatha looks up from her tea and sets the cup down. She hums before opening her mouth. “I didn’t think you were the type to follow rules,” she says, her blue eyes staying on Rio just long enough to make Rio wonder what the hell she’s thinking. “But do go on, then. Rules. Do tell.”</p><p>Rio finishes the last bite of her toast, chases it down with orange juice, and clears her throat. “So, we should have three rules,” she says. “Just three simple ones we can either agree on, argue about, or whatever.” Agatha just nods, watching her like she’s waiting for what’s next.</p><p>“Rule one,” Rio says, holding up a finger like she’s making a serious point, “we got to ease up on the surprise trips. Alice already called me out on it. She thinks it will start to look sketchy if I keep ‘spontaneously’ jetting off and just happen to end up in the same place as you. Plus, at this rate, I’m gonna run out of air miles before the year’s even halfway done.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t argue and just gives another nod. “Fair enough. And the second rule?”</p><p>“Next rule,” Rio hesitates. “We should really sleep in separate beds after we, you know…”</p><p>“You can say ‘sex,’ Rio,” Agatha pleasantly supplies.</p><p>“Yeah, I know that,” Rio shoots back, rolling her eyes as Agatha tries, and fails, to hide a smile. “Anyway, strictly separate beds after sex. Keeps it casual, keeps the lines clear.”</p><p>“If I remember correctly, you were the one who was supposed to be in the other room last night,” Agatha says, crossing her arms before popping a grape in her mouth, just like Rio did. </p><p>“I know,” Rio mutters, annoyed at herself more than anything. “And that’s why I’m saying it again. I was just too...” She stops. No way in hell she’s admitting she was too exhausted to move. Agatha already walks around with too much smug for one person.</p><p>“I was way too drunk,” she lies instead. “Too wasted to move an inch. But that’s not really the point, is it? Either way, it’s clear now, we should definitely stick to separate beds. Agreed?”</p><p>Agatha pauses, pretending to consider it seriously. “Agreed. Anything else?”</p><p>“Anything else what?”</p><p>“You said three rules. We’ve only got two.”</p><p>Right. The third. Rio pauses and meets Agatha’s eyes, which, frankly, is a mistake. </p><p>Because the wind has the nerve to catch a lock of Agatha’s hair at just the right moment, and she looks unfairly perfect in that slow-motion, sun-drenched way that makes Rio feel like she’s glitching. Jesus. If this keeps happening, she’s going to need prescription meds.</p><p>But before Rio can think of a third rule, Agatha interrupts. “Well, if you’re out of ideas, I reckon I might know what the third one should be,” she replies calmly but pointedly.</p><p>Rio raises an eyebrow. “Okay, go on then.”</p><p>She watches as Agatha exhales through her nose, that subtle, telltale sign she gives right before saying something serious. “If one of us wants to stop, we stop,” she says, calm but dead honest. “No bargaining. No second-guessing. No trying to change each other’s mind. One of us calls it, and that’s the end of it. No questions asked.”</p><p>Rio goes a bit speechless for a moment, her eyes locked on Agatha like she’s trying to make sure she really means it. After a beat, she clears her throat and nods slowly. </p><p>“Right. Yeah, that’s a good one. I wouldn’t have thought of a better one than that.”</p><p>Agatha chews a spoonful of yogurt, swallows, then delicately dabs at her lips with a napkin. </p><p>“Perfect. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’d better change into something a bit more pool-appropriate. You’re more than welcome to join me back here once you’re done with breakfast,” she says coolly, sliding out of her chair before striding toward the villa without sparing Rio another glance.</p><p>Once Agatha’s out of sight, Rio leans back in her chair, telling herself this is fine. This is smart. They are two grown women who know what they’re doing. Adults with boundaries. Yeah, this is right. This is fine. She repeats it like a mantra: totally, absolutely, one hundred percent fine.</p><hr /><p>Rio’s been soaking in the pool for fifteen minutes now, the warm Italian sun baking her skin to a lovely golden tan. By the poolside, Agatha lounges on a sunbed, the same book from earlier resting on her lap. She seldom looks up, except when the sun moves and a stray ray threatens to burn her pale skin. Then she adjusts her sunglasses and goes back to her reading, seemingly unperturbed by Rio splashing around like a kid every now and then.</p><p>Rio glances over at Agatha, who’s clearly not a water person. But damn, that ridiculous black swimsuit she’s rocking — simple, sleek, with a high cut that shows off her killer curves and that absurdly perfect ass — is doing a lot of things to Rio. </p><p>She smirks. </p><p>Bless the gods for that gorgeously carved butt. </p><p>Then she realizes she’s straight-up voyeur-ing. Fuck. </p><p>When did she turn into one of those creeps?</p><p>Shaking her head, Rio paddles over, hoping Agatha didn’t catch whatever she was just doing. She leans on the edge, water dripping from her hair. </p><p>“Kind of rude, don’t you think? You’re the one who invited me out here to swim, and yet somehow, you’re the one not getting wet,” she calls out.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t even look up as she says, “I never said I was actually going to swim.”</p><p>“You sure you don’t want to join me?” Rio asks. “The water’s really nice.”</p><p>Agatha finally glances up, sliding her sunglasses down just enough to meet Rio’s eyes. “Tempting,” she says with a small smile, “but I like my books dry.”</p><p>“Oh, come on. Don’t be such a grandma,” Rio teases, splashing a little water her way. “Quit being the boring princess for once and have some fun. You’re seriously missing out.”</p><p>Agatha lifts her book a little higher, brows arching. “Rio, I’m warning you. This is a limited edition copy. If this gets so much as a splash on it, you’re paying for it, and not with cash, sweetheart.”</p><p>Rio smirks, resting her chin on her arms. “Fine, then how about you read me something from it?” she says, eyeing Agatha. “If I’m not allowed to touch it, the least you can do is share.”</p><p>“You just called me boring, and now you want me to read to you?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio grins. “But also because I’m curious. I’ve never actually read Sappho before. So why don’t you come sit here and read me something? I swear, I won’t drown your precious book.” </p><p>When Agatha doesn’t answer right away, Rio has the cheek to pout, making her hazel brown eyes even bigger and more doe-like. </p><p>Agatha sighs, swings her legs off the sunbed, and pads over to the pool. Rio fights back a smile as the Princess sits on the edge and dips her feet in, the book still clutched safely in her hand. </p><p>“If this is some elaborate way of mocking me, you’re walking out of here with at least one limb broken,” Agatha warns, deadpan but Rio’s smile only grows wider.</p><p>“Alright, no need to get violent,” Rio laughs, raising her hands. “I’m genuinely serious. Just read me some of your favorite lines, or wherever you left off before I interrupted.”</p><p>Agatha stares at her for a moment, clearly pretending Rio’s starting to get on her nerves, then turns back to her book. “I can’t believe you’ve never read Sappho even once. I’ve never met a lesbian who hasn’t. It’s basically queer literature 101. God help you. You’re American, and an abomination to lesbianism. Some people would be pretty disappointed to hear that.”</p><p>Rio snorts in disbelief but can’t help smiling. “I’m the abomination?” Agatha just shoots her a sideways glance, clearly trying not to smile. “Fine then, Your Royal Highness, let me hear it. Enlighten me on what I’ve been missing.” </p><p>Agatha flips a page, “Alright, here’s one that’s probably her second most famous. A strong take on beauty and love, as they say.” She clears her throat and reads:</p><p>
  <em> “Some say a host of horsemen, some say foot soldiers, some say a fleet is the most beautiful thing on the dark earth, but I say it is whatever one loves.” </em>
</p><p>Agatha doesn’t look up, giving Rio the chance to just unapologetically stare at her while she explains. “Basically, it means beauty isn’t just one thing that is fixed. It’s whatever speaks to your heart. Everyone’s got their own version. Everyone sees it their own way, and that’s what makes love so powerful.”</p><p>“And is that your favorite?” Rio asks.</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, eyes still on the page. </p><p>“It’s one of her more complete fragments, but not exactly my personal favorite.”</p><p>“Then what is?” Rio asks again, quietly thanking the gods Agatha is so caught up in the book, because Rio honestly can’t stop staring at her right now.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t answer right away as she flips through a few pages, “It’s actually one of the really incomplete ones. It’s barely a full thought. Just a few lines pulled from old papyrus that almost didn’t survive. But somehow, someone loved it enough to save what little was left.”</p><p>She finds the page and taps her finger lightly against the text. </p><p>“They’ve labeled this one Fragment 91,” she mumbles, almost like she’s thinking out loud more than speaking to Rio. Then she reads:</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    <em> “I do not expect to touch the sky with my two arms,  </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> or to hold the shining stars with my two hands,  </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> nor to embrace the sun as it goes down in the waves,  </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> but I want to hold you, to hold you tight.” </em>
  </p>
</blockquote><p>The silence that follows is thick.</p><p>Agatha still doesn’t look at Rio when she speaks again. </p><p>“It’s not about wanting everything. It’s just about wanting one thing. Just one. And even if, deep down, you know you might never really have them, you still want them anyway. You’d give anything, even if they were never yours to keep. It’s a little tragic, but somehow, that want still gives you hope. Like maybe, for a little while, the wanting is the closest thing to having.”</p><p>Rio doesn't say anything. She simply watches her, each word sinking a bit too deeply. There’s something about the way Agatha speaks like she’s not merely reading an old poet’s words but pulling them from somewhere personal. Somewhere that maybe hurts a little. </p><p>And Rio, too, feels that anguish in a place she doesn’t typically allow anyone to touch. It’s ridiculous, she tells herself. They’re only words. But damn, do they bite.</p><p>She doesn’t realize how long she’s been staring until Agatha suddenly removes her eyes from the book and meets hers. Her instinct kicks in quickly, and she looks away, clearing her throat like she’s trying to shake off whatever the heck just happened.</p><p>“Well,” Rio says, a little too brightly, “no wonder I haven’t read it. That’s some seriously sad gay shit.” She forces a weak laugh, hoping it’ll clear the sudden heaviness between them. Her smile, however, wobbles when Agatha presses her lips into a thin line, and looks at her knowingly.</p><p>And Rio again wants nothing more than to know what’s going on in her head. What she's thinking. What she's feeling. But more than that, she wants to know if she’s hurting. And if she is...God, Rio would do anything to be the one to take that pain away.</p><p>“Just admit you have terrible taste in books,” Agatha quips, that unmistakable British smugness sliding right back into place. “I can’t imagine how you get through all that political drivel and dry history. Do you read them or just absorb them through osmosis?” </p><p>“First of all, I have excellent taste in books. And I know a lot of very smart, cool people who’d vouch for that,” Rio says with a laugh. “And politics is basically a contact sport. Sure, I want to gouge my eyes out every time I have to read another 600-page biography by some white dude who thinks he’s the second coming, but it’s not all dry and awful like you make it sound.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a huff of laughter. “Still, that sounds like a terrible book club.”</p><p>“Oh yeah?” Rio says, grinning wide and showing off the little gap in her front teeth. Then without warning, she snatches the book right out of Agatha’s hand and, with a quick flick of her wrist, sends it sailing onto the nearest sunbed, landing perfectly just as she intended. </p><p>Agatha’s eyes snap wide in shock. “Didn’t I just tell you to be careful with that book—” she starts, but before she can finish, Rio grabs her wrist and pulls her into the pool with a splash.</p><p>The Princess gasps, struggling to keep her head above water, but Rio’s already laughing and holding her by the waist. “Rio! You absolute fucking nightmare!” she scowls, splashing water back at her with mock annoyance.</p><p>“See? Told you the water’s nice,” Rio says, her hands still resting on Agatha’s waist.</p><p>Agatha shoots her a glare, but it’s all playful. “Oh, fuck off,” she snaps, and splashes water right at Rio’s face. Rio just laughs harder, her smile stretching wide enough to crack the sky. Soon, they’re trading splashes like a couple of teenagers who’ve forgotten how to act their age.</p><p>When Agatha finally gives up on being chased around the pool, they drift into the shallower end, where neither of them has to stand on their toes. Their bodies hover close, faces just inches apart, breaths syncing without trying. They’re both grinning like idiots, half from the adrenaline, half from something neither of them wants to name yet.</p><p>“God, I hate you,” Agatha mumbles under her breath. Her hair’s a mess of damp waves, cheeks a little pink from the sun, and she appears to be more soaked than Rio, who has been in the pool way longer.</p><p>Rio laughs, blinking water from her lashes. “Not as much as I hate you.”</p><p>Their eyes lock and hold, and Rio’s breath catches as the sun touches Agatha’s blue eyes, making them nearly shine. She notices how the other woman’s countenance begins to subtly change, a flicker of vulnerability breaking through her usual guarded coolness. </p><p>Then, almost without meaning to, her eyes drift down to Rio’s lips. And Rio doesn’t even have to overthink what it means when Agatha gently cups both her cheeks, then leans in to claim her mouth with her own. The kiss starts slow, soft, with that quiet kind of wonder that almost feels like awe, until Rio’s lips part and she feels herself yielding to Agatha’s insistent tongue.</p><p>The cool tile presses against Rio’s back as Agatha holds her against the wall, the water rippling softly above their waists. </p><p>Rio closes her eyes as Agatha’s tongue brushes the roof of her mouth, and she has to swallow a soft whimper. Under the water, Agatha finds her hand, lacing their fingers for just a second before guiding it down between her thighs. The moan that Agatha lets out sends a bolt straight to Rio’s gut. She feels it everywhere. And now, with only the thin fabric of Agatha’s swimsuit between her hand and all that heat, any hope of staying calm is long gone.</p><p>“Touch me,” Agatha whispers, her lips brushing Rio’s.</p><p>Rio opens her eyes, frozen for a second, not sure she heard her right. She pulls back a little, just enough to look at Agatha’s face and sees something different in her expression yet not entirely unfamiliar. It’s the look she wears when she wants something so badly. </p><p>And God, Rio is so stupidly grateful she’s the one Agatha’s looking at like that.</p><p>“I hope the water hasn’t made you go deaf,” Agatha adds, “I said, touch me, Rio. I want you to touch me.” She doesn’t even flinch or look away. She just stares at her, lips parted like she’s waiting for another kiss.</p><p>Rio’s hand stays where Agatha placed it. “Here? Are you sure?”</p><p>Agatha rests her forehead against Rio’s. “Sweetheart, you know I wouldn’t be saying it if I didn’t mean it.” And with that, Rio’s mouth crashes back onto Agatha’s, her fingers slipping beneath the fabric of Agatha’s swimsuit to find warm, slick skin. The Princess responds instantly, pressing her body harder against Rio’s hand, and the latter can’t help but smile against her lips. </p><p>As Agatha keeps grinding against Rio’s fingers, she grabs her face again, sucking her lips with even more hunger. She grinds down hard, again and again, and again, the friction so tight that Rio might actually come just from the desperate sounds Agatha muffles between their kisses.</p><p>Agatha lets go of Rio’s face and throws her head back, eyes fluttering shut. Rio catches her just in time, cradling her head so it doesn’t slam into the hard edge of the pool. She sinks her teeth into Agatha’s exposed neck as her fingers move faster and harder beneath the water.</p><p>“Fuck, that’s it, Rio. You’re an absolute sweetheart,” she breathes out, fully sinking into Rio’s grasp, trusting her to hold her up. She arches her back, pressing her chest against Rio’s, “Harder. Make me take it. Make me feel you...really feel you inside me.”</p><p>Agatha has been doing all the talking since, for some reason, Rio is too engrossed in how the Princess responds to her every touch to even say anything. </p><p>Jesus, her brain feels like it just got hit by a chemistry bomb. </p><p>She suddenly wants to find that idiot Bryan from her junior year, the one who swore brain chemistry was a load of crap and cost her a perfect score on that chemistry final. Wherever Bryan’s hiding now, he’s probably miserable and still a brain chemistry virgin, because Rio’s mind just got thoroughly initiated thanks to this mind-bending sex.</p><p>Rio has never done anything like this before, never felt this exposed. It’s as if even the sun above is too shy to watch what’s happening between them. The whole thing feels wild, messy, raw, and intoxicating. And to her surprise, Rio finds herself <em> loving </em> it. </p><p>This fierce, untamed kind of freedom.</p><p>Her life has never felt suffocating exactly, but she has always been aware of invisible walls, expectations, and rules. A cage made of glass. She figures Agatha lives the same kind of life, trapped in her own way. Perhaps even worse. But right now, Rio feels alive in a manner that mirrors Sappho’s words: wanting something so deeply it’s both beautiful and unbearable.</p><p>She has no choice but to admit it. She craves Agatha, in a way that feels almost biblical. At this moment, Rio knows exactly how much she wants to hold her like this. To be the one who makes her vulnerable. It’s Rio who’s doing this to the Princess, but more than that, it’s Rio who’s reaching for and touching the real Agatha underneath it all.</p><hr /><p>It’s silent for a long stretch before Agatha finally moves onto her side and pulls the blanket up to cover them both. Their skin is still warm, and their hair is still damp: leftover from the pool, the shower after, and everything they did in between. </p><p>The talking. The laughing. The drinking. The fucking. The way they couldn’t keep their hands off each other. None of it really gave them much time to dry off.</p><p>The large windows stand open, and outside, the cicadas start their slow, lethargic chorus into the night. Rio lies back against the bed, eyes fixed on the ceiling. The mural above them is different from last night — just twisting vines and leaves — because they’re in the guest room, or really, Rio’s designated room in the villa. Her fingers roam absentmindedly across the duvet, tracing soft circles as she studies the artwork. </p><p>Then she feels Agatha move beside her, lightly pressing her forehead against her shoulder. </p><p>Rio hesitates, fingers pausing mid-circle on the bedspread. There are a dozen questions in her thoughts right now, but only one lasts long enough to make it out of her mouth. </p><p>“I know it’s customary for most royals to have ridiculously long names, but I’m just curious, what’s seems to be the story behind yours?” </p><p>“My name?” Agatha blinks, like she hadn’t been expecting the question.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio replies, propping up her elbow. “Everyone’s name means something or has a story behind it. Like mine, for example: my parents met at the Brandywine River back in Delaware. My mom was in college at the time, on a picnic with her friends. My dad was there too, totally by accident. He’d gotten lost on a hike and ended up crashing their picnic, thinking it was some open-to-everyone thing.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a soft laugh, and Rio shakes her head fondly.</p><p>“At first, my mom said they were all kind of freaked out. Like, who is this random dude just sitting down and piling food on his plate?” Rio tells her, smiling. “But he looked harmless enough with his glasses and his ridiculously polite smile. So my mom gave him a juice box and a sandwich out of pity, and apparently, he just...never left.”</p><p>She chuckles. “They still argue about what was in that sandwich, by the way. But yeah, ‘Rio’ because they met by a river, and ‘Celeste’ because on the night I was born, my mom and dad swear the sky was packed with so many stars. Like the celestial gods were throwing a party in my honor. Their words, not mine.”</p><p>Agatha smiles, the corners of her mouth tugging up almost despite herself as Rio waits expectantly. “Well, I don’t know if I can top that,” she says. “Mine’s a bit more predictable, I suppose. Traditional, if you want to be slightly generous.”</p><p>Rio stays silent, just watching.</p><p>“Agatha was my grandfather's great grandmother,” she begins. “Basically, she’s my maternal great-great-great-grandmother. She was the very first woman in our family to earn a title all on her own. Not that it was anything major back then, mostly ceremonial, but from what I’ve heard, she was tough as nails, stubborn, and very impossible to boss around. So, naturally, they figured that name would suit me perfectly.”</p><p>“And boy, they weren’t wrong,” Rio supplies teasingly.</p><p>“I’m afraid I must insist I’m a bit more manageable than the old hag,” Agatha replies, feigning offense, and Rio laughs before urging her to go on. “The remainder of my name,” she continues, “is a rather long-winded tribute to my mother’s lineage. Eleanor, of course, comes from her. Victoria, however, honors another great-great-grandma. But here’s the curious part, though it was never officially confirmed, I later learned it was my father who chose the name Victoria, and that it may very well have belonged to his first love.”</p><p>Rio blinks, surprised. “What? Seriously?” </p><p>“Seriously.” Agatha shrugs, her smile turning a little melancholic. “I overheard them arguing about it some years ago. I never thought it was right to bring it up. But as for why my father chose it, I’d like to believe there was a thoughtful reason behind it. He usually did. Hopefully something more meaningful than just trying to spite my mother.”</p><p>It’s no secret — not to Rio, at least — that the Queen and the late King Consort were never exactly the picture of a perfect marriage. Agatha had told her that months ago, in passing, during one of their long, meandering phone calls. </p><p>Just an arranged match, she’d said, like most royal couples in the books. </p><p>Still, hearing these little details, Agatha overhearing arguments, the implication that her name might have been chosen just to piss off her mother, it makes something twist in Rio’s chest. </p><p>She doesn’t let it show, though. Instead, she simply observes Agatha, the way her eyes lift to the ceiling, as if she is trying not to appear to be recalling too much all at once. </p><p>Rio takes her time to let the silence stretch between them, careful not to rush it. Then, quietly, she takes the opportunity to ask something she’s been meaning to for a while. “Hope you don’t mind me asking, but does anyone in your family, you know, know about you?” </p><p>It takes a few seconds before Agatha answers. “The only person back home who really knows, aside from William, is Jennifer. She’s practically family at this point. But that’s about it.” She pauses for a moment. “My brother Edward and I were never particularly close, so I’ve never told him outright. But I suspect he knows. Or at least, senses it.” </p><p>She then draws in a quiet breath. “I believe my father knew too,” Agatha adds softly. “He never said anything, but I’d like to think he understood. And chose, in his own way, to just let me be. I wish I had told him, though, before he passed. Not because I think it would’ve changed anything, but because he deserved to at least hear it from me.”</p><p>Rio hesitates, biting her lip, but the question slips out before she can stop herself. </p><p>“And what about Her Majesty? Does the Queen know?”</p><p>Agatha lets out a slow, bitter sigh before speaking. “My mother, Her Majesty, has always been a cold and unforgiving woman. A real cold-hearted realist. There’s not an ounce of softness in her when it comes to me,” she says, almost as if reminding herself more than telling Rio.</p><p>
  <span>“She sat me down just a few days after my father died and made it unequivocally clear that any deviant, selfish, or unnatural desires I might be harboring were an utter disgrace, not just to our family’s name, but to everything she had built and everything the crown stood for. That my feelings, my truth, were not just completely irrelevant but dangerously evil. And if I ever failed to suppress that part of myself, I would become nothing more than a liability and a threat to the crown and the legacy I am expected to protect.” </span>
</p><p>Rio’s stomach twists into knots. She imagines Agatha, vulnerable, crushed under all that grief, being told to lock away the very parts of herself that screamed for freedom, to silence her truth as if it were merely something best buried deep. The thought claws at Rio’s chest, and she hates how miserable and alone that must’ve made Agatha feel.</p><p>“That’s just awful,” Rio says, reaching out carefully to cover Agatha’s hand with hers. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>Agatha keeps her eyes down. “It’s fine,” she says, though Rio can clearly tell it’s not. “I’ve long since come to terms with it. I’ve accepted that this is the life I was given. And besides, my mother’s getting old, and won’t be around much longer anyway, thank God,” she adds with a bitter laugh, trying to hide what she’s really feeling. “And if my beloved brother finally takes the throne, maybe then my life will be a little less unbearable. At least, I hope so.”</p><p>“But still, that’s total bullshit. You don’t have to accept this life like it’s the only one you’ve got. You still have a choice of your own. You don’t have to settle for something just because that’s what people expect,” Rio says, her frustration bleeding through without even meaning to.</p><p>Agatha rises slowly, leaning back against the headboard as she sits up in bed. </p><p>Rio can only watch and wait for her to speak. </p><p>“I was five years old when I realised that everyone in my country knew my name, but I would never know theirs,” Agatha tells Rio. “Even then, I understood what I meant to them. I won’t lie, I do feel the power in it sometimes. But more than that, I feel the cost. I’m a reflection of the people who look at me and see themselves. And if I walked away, if I chose my own freedom over the role I was born into, it wouldn’t just hurt me. It would leave thousands without someone to stand for them. And that...that would be the most selfish thing to do.”</p><p>“So, I’ve learned to accept the life I was given. Princess Agatha will always belong to Britain; that part of me is not mine to own. But then there’s Agatha Harkness, who has to find some fragile peace with the life Princess Agatha is forced to live. Because only by accepting <em> that </em> can Agatha Harkness truly belong to herself. And she has to. If she doesn’t…she’ll just disappear.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t say anything at first. She just looks at Agatha like she’s seeing her with new eyes. Somehow, this is the same girl who once convinced Rio she didn’t give a damn about anything. That she didn’t really feel things the way other people did. The same girl the rest of the world still sees as this perfectly polished, distant princess, unspoiled by anything at all. And it really took Rio this long to get the full realization of how mistaken everyone has been.</p><p>Agatha is neither frigid nor unfeeling. </p><p>She’s just been bleeding in a language no one ever bothered to learn.</p><p>“Is there ever a chance she might want to belong to someone else?” Rio’s voice is low and gentle, as if she’s afraid to break whatever fragile thread is holding Agatha together. </p><p>The Princess takes a slow breath through her nose before finally looking at Rio. And there’s a different kind of sadness in her eyes that Rio’s never seen before.</p><p>“She would want to,” Agatha admits, “though just for a little while.”</p>
