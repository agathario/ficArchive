<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Belatedly, Agatha realizes she’s nervous. She never gave Rio an answer one way or the other– not deeming the situation serious enough to unblock her number– but now she has the sudden burning fear that maybe Rio won’t be here after all and she’ll have to do this by herself.</p><p>She thinks she might throw up her coffee in the decorative, half-dead bushes lining the parking lot at the thought, but then Agatha sees her.</p><p>Leaning against the building just to the side of the front doors, face drawn in concentration beneath her sunglasses as she talks into her cell phone, her free arm crossed over her chest while her hand gesticulates in time with her words. She taps one brown loafer-clad foot against the concrete, clearly displeased with whoever she's talking to. The sunlight catches on the defined muscles of her arms, golden bronze and mouthwatering.</p><p>The moment Rio sees her she lifts the sunglasses from her face, meeting Agatha’s eyes and quickly wrapping up her conversation. <em>She was waiting for me</em>, Agatha realizes. Unsure what to do with that, she simply crosses the lot to meet her.</p><p>Or: The one where an estranged Agatha &amp; Rio find themselves joining a class action lawsuit together.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>hi! some quick housekeeping.</p><p>-this is my very first attempt at a multi chapter fic so you may have to bear with me a bit here! so far ive got like 9 chapters outlined so there will be, at a minimum, 9 chapters</p><p>-this work is the second in a series but if you really don't want to you don't have to read the first one to understand this one I don't think. the gist of 'birds in flight' being that Nicky died three years prior and Agatha &amp; Rio's relationship has totally fallen apart, except sometimes they link up to fuck nasty style</p><p>-the real meat of the plot doesn't come in for a few chapters tbh, I had some Establishing to do. I am not sorry</p><p>-all chapter titles come from Richard Siken's poem "Litany in Which Certain Things Are Crossed Out." it is incredible (like all of his work) and I recommend you check it out!</p><p>-I have no beta so all mistakes are my own.</p><p>I think that's it! pls enjoy</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>From her current vantage point along the back wall Agatha can see the full layout of the small coffee shop– the baristas leaning on the counters to gossip between orders, the stay at home mom rocking the stroller back and forth with her foot while she inhales her coffee, and the sweaty businessman taking an obnoxiously loud phone call all blending in with the predictable lo-fi music humming through the tinny speakers.</p><p>The whole place is trying a bit too hard to be unique in her opinion, from the haphazardly strung string lights to the mismatched chairs ringing the tables, like they <em> really </em> want their patrons to think they’d found all of the furniture secondhand somewhere and hadn’t just ordered it all from a manufacturer. The plush burgundy armchair beneath her still smells like a warehouse, though, so the execution is a bit lacking.</p><p>But Agatha knows she can’t fault them too much, because she was the one who had punched <em> coffee shop </em> into Google Maps and picked a spot across town at random. She had awoken this morning with the distinct feeling that if she spent the day working from home like usual she’d end up throwing herself head first down the stairs, so this had been the alternative.</p><p>Even though nothing has explicitly changed, a looming cloud of dread has been following her since that night in November, memories long undisturbed now deciding to wait around corners and beneath the floorboards and sneak up on her when she least expects.</p><p>Agatha has made no memories at <em> Stir It Up</em>, no possibility of a familiar scent or an old photo to make her palms clammy and her throat tight. It also seems to finally be done snowing for the season, so she hadn’t had to layer up beyond her faded jeans and an old baby blue college sweatshirt beneath her coat. She’d managed to survive through January– the anniversary of his death coming and going with all of the usual agony– and is working on slogging her way through February, more than ready for this godforsaken winter to finally end.</p><p>The open document on her laptop stares up at her mockingly, waiting for the edits and notes she was supposed to have sent in yesterday. She glances at the little red bubble above the envelope icon at the bottom of the screen, wondering if it would be any less painful to go through the pile of unanswered emails in her inbox. Her half empty iced latte rests on the side table next to her, slowly but surely sweating a ring of condensation into the wood as the ice melts. Agatha shifts, tucking one leg up under herself and silently begging herself to focus on the task at hand.</p><p>She gets three minutes into demolishing her poor, incompetent subordinate’s report when the bell chimes over the door, and whoever passes through leaves it open for too long. A cold gust of air slices clean through the warmth of the cafe and sends a shiver down Agatha’s spine. She looks up to find the culprit, a scowl already firmly in place before she realizes what she’s seeing.</p><p>Rio is there, holding the door open for a woman to walk through behind her, returning the smile she’s offered. When the door is shut again, Rio holds her hand out for the woman’s coat while she shimmies out of it and hands it over before taking the garment to a table near the front window and draping it over the back of one chair. She does the same with her own, like she’s done this a thousand times. She walks back to join the woman in front of the large chalkboard menu, resting her hands in the pockets of her high waisted black slacks. The sleeves of her white dress shirt are rolled up to her elbows like she was getting frustrated with them being in her way at work this morning, but her appearance is otherwise pristine.</p><p>Her hair, tucked behind one ear to expose a set of small silver hoops, falls in glossy, controlled waves. All of her bruising from November is gone, of course. Agatha would know– she’d watched the teeth marks on her own shoulder fade and eventually disappear in the mirror. She looks put together, suave, a total match with the woman by her side.</p><p>The woman is beautiful in a quietly glamorous sort of way, her thick chestnut hair clipped back from her face and falling around her shoulders, an emerald skirt suit hugging her curvy figure just on the publicly acceptable side of sensuality. Agatha thinks the woman looks younger than Rio and herself, maybe still in her late 20’s. Her full red lips curve in another small smile when Rio ushers her forward to order and then pays for them both.</p><p>Agatha realizes her heart is pounding in her chest and jerks her head back down to her computer screen, trying to focus on the little blinking cursor and the words swimming before her eyes. How had she not realized she’d picked a spot so close to Rio’s office? And why is Rio even out of said office at one in the afternoon on a work day?</p><p>Agatha pushes her glasses back up on the bridge of her nose from where they’ve slipped with her knuckles, silently fuming. The anger starts to boil in her chest, her face growing hot. She just wants one goddamn moment for herself– one entirely bland day where nothing at all happens and no ghosts come to call. Agatha can’t help but track the motion of the barista handing over their drinks and Rio resting her hand against the small of the woman’s back while she guides her to the table where she left their coats.</p><p>The fire of her rage ratchets up inside of her further, and Agatha wonders if committing arson would really be so bad. Burning down not only the coffee shop but maybe the entire strip mall and everyone inside of it rather than adding this stupid cafe to the list of places she can never come back to.</p><p>It happens so quickly that Agatha almost misses it, too busy trying to calm herself down. Rio turns away from the woman just enough to cast her eyes to where Agatha sits in the back, honey brown locking onto crystal blue. <em>Like</em> magnets, she thinks bitterly. There’s no surprise there though, no shock value. Just that same, unreadable stare, gone as soon as it comes. Agatha watches the corners of those eyes crinkle up when she looks back at Skirt Suit, clearly giving some playful response to her last comment.</p><p>Agatha wills her eyes back down to her work, opening up her email and clicking around her inbox at random without really reading any of it. She thinks back to the last time they'd seen each other, about what Rio had said about having someone new to Christmas shop for. Her own thoughts from that night dredge themselves up, of some woman waiting for Rio to come home, screaming and crying at the sight of Agatha’s marks all over her. Maybe it hadn't been as big of a deal for her as Agatha thought it might.</p><p>Still nameless, but no longer faceless- Agatha watches Skirt Suit take a sip of her coffee and rest her chin on the palm of her hand. Her mind, unhelpful as ever, supplies an image of the two of them fucking on Christmas morning, Grinch-themed wrapping paper littering the floor around their writhing bodies.</p><p>The uneasy feeling in Agatha’s gut– the sense of dread she’s been trying to outrun– returns in full. It only makes her angrier, really. Because truthfully? Rio is not supposed to be here. She’s not supposed to be anywhere in Agatha’s life that isn’t her bedroom, showing up to claw at each other like animals before leaving her alone again. </p><p>Agatha had meticulously compartmentalized her– crammed Rio’s formerly all-encompassing role in her life down to just the voice in her head and the warm body staining her sheets. But now, in this subpar coffee shop and without any prior warning, Rio has seemingly broken out of the flimsy box Agatha had sealed her in. On one hand, she can’t believe it took this long for them to run into one another outside of the house or the cemetery. On the other, she had begun to hope they simply never would.</p><p>Twenty emails opened and either trashed or unanswered later, Agatha can feel her patience wearing thin. Abandoning her earlier hope for a peaceful day and desperate to stop feeling like a caged animal, she resolves to start wrapping things up. </p><p>She picks up the thin plastic cup of her iced latte, ignoring the way it makes her palm damp. Agatha takes a sip and holds the watered down liquid on her tongue while she reads the next paragraph of the report, mentally noting all of the things that she’ll need to change before this gets sent out. Her focus shatters like a windowpane struck by a baseball bat at the sound of Rio’s loud, unrestrained laughter from across the room. Agatha’s eyes find her immediately– the exposed column of her throat as her joy pulls her backwards, the gap between her teeth on full display with her smile. Agatha realizes it’s the first time she’s heard that sound in years.</p><p>It tugs at the fragile threads keeping her sanity intact, the ones she’d forgotten to weave back in after watching Rio’s headlights pull away from her house and disappear into the night. Agatha doesn’t notice that she’s crushing the cup in her hand until the coffee splashes down across the hem of her sweatshirt and the leg of her jeans, the dark liquid immediately seeping in and chilling her skin.</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>,” she hisses quietly to herself, pushing her computer off of her lap and onto the coffee table by her feet. She sets the distorted cup back on the table, fruitlessly shaking her hand in the air to dry it off. A barista that has clearly watched her outburst rushes over from behind the counter, his eyes wide beneath thick layers of smudged eyeliner.</p><p>“Oh my gosh ma’am, are you alright? Here, let me help.” He rushes out, quickly taking the cup and tossing it into a nearby trash can before wiping down the table and reaching out with a fistful of napkins, a flurry of motion.</p><p>The heat in her face is so strong she knows she’s turned visibly red, anger swirling with embarrassment in her throat. Agatha stares down at the dark wet patch on her jeans, but she can feel those fucking eyes on her, burning through her skull and making her hands tremble. Of <em> course </em> she’s watching now, pulling her focus away from Skirt Suit for just long enough to witness Agatha’s public humiliation.</p><p>“Get <em> off </em>of me. Don’t you know anything about personal space?” She spits at the kid, surely no more than 22, and shoots up from her chair when he takes a step back with his hands raised in surrender. His blubbered apology falls on deaf ears, Agatha shoulder checking him as she steps past and curves down the small back hall to where the single-occupant restroom lies.</p><p>She shuts herself in and flicks on the fluorescent light with more force than she knows is necessary. Agatha can see the collection of bugs that have wriggled their way behind the plastic casing of the light and died for their curiosity. A black stall divider closes the toilet off from the counter, leaving her in a narrow pass with the door on one side and a large trash can close to overflowing on the other.</p><p>Agatha pulls a paper towel from the dispenser and begins dabbing hopelessly at her sweatshirt with the cheap, rough material. After what must be a decade and a half, the fabric is so worn it’s nearly translucent in places. It probably won’t survive the accident unscathed, she decides.</p><p>So lost in the task at hand, Agatha doesn’t hear the door click quietly open and shut again. Doesn’t need to when all of the hairs on her body stand up of their own accord, straining toward her like sunflowers seeking light. In her mind, she curses her body’s apparent wiring to betray her at every turn.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t look at her directly, but shifts her eyes up enough to catch her in the big mirror covering the wall above the counter. Rio looks just as professional up close too, her light makeup hiding her eye bags and carefully applied blush bringing life back to her cheeks. Probably hoping to impress Skirt Suit.</p><p>Agatha knows she looks disheveled, but at least she brushed her hair this morning and is wearing real pants, which is more than she can say for most days. In her escape to the bathroom she pushed her glasses back up on her head, keeping the hair from her eyes while she works at the stain.</p><p>Rio wordlessly reaches past her to tear a fresh paper towel from the dispenser before tugging on the hem of Agatha’s sweatshirt, batting her hand lightly out of the way and taking over the task of blotting with much more grace than Agatha had been using. Unsure what to do with herself, Agatha crumples the damp paper towel in her fist so tightly that her nails dig into the meat of her palm. The sting mercifully lessens some of the pressure building in her chest.</p><p>Slightly hunched over as she works, the thin chain of Rio’s necklace slips from beneath the collar of her blouse. It catches the light, drawing Agatha’s eye. Three small stones dangle at the center– purple, green, blue. Agatha, Rio, Nicky. Agatha had gotten it for her as a gift when he was born, pulling the tiny box out of their go bag once things had finally calmed down.</p><p>Her skin feels too tight, her lungs suddenly too small to get in a good breath. Agatha knows she has to break the moment before it breaks her.</p><p>“You have my purple cardigan,” she bleats out. An accusation, the first thing that comes to mind. She’s not supposed to mention their previous encounters, but all of the rules seem to have been suspended here. She’s free falling.</p><p>Rio scoffs, but doesn’t look up from where she’s working, her fingers shifting to a different part of the stain.</p><p>“You’ve literally just spilled coffee all over <em> my </em> sweatshirt. Glass houses, Agatha.”</p><p>The words are measured, like she’s holding herself an arm’s length away from the situation. Agatha bites harshly at her bottom lip. She hadn’t remembered that this sweatshirt was Rio’s and not her own. She considers telling Rio that anything that’s closing in on 20 years spent in her closet belongs to her, but thinks better of it at the last minute.</p><p>Agatha wishes she would just look at her and not the stupid blue fabric in her hands, the frustration welling up in her throat. She grinds her teeth, choosing a different mode of attack.</p><p>“A coffee date in the middle of the work day is a bit irresponsible, don’t you think?” She asks, her voice dripping in faux-innocence. At this, Rio does look up at her, her fingers stilling. The shock Agatha finds in her face only serves to encourage her, so she presses further.</p><p>“Couldn’t wait until you were off the clock? I mean, I definitely get it. She’s hot. Probably, what– 27? 28 at most? God, I remember how much more flexible I was at that age. I can only imagine–”</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>,” Rio cuts off her rambling. Her voice is strained, caught somewhere between exasperation and…amusement?</p><p>Agatha remembers herself, taking her bottom lip back between her teeth sharply in hopes it can serve as a makeshift gag. She wills her face not to flush with shame at the outburst– this is why she can’t operate around Rio without firm boundaries in place. Because she runs her fucking mouth. Gives too much away. Sets herself up to be vulnerable in the way that only ever seems to end in pain these days.</p><p>Why did she even bring it up? All Rio is going to do is confirm her suspicions, maybe leave her with another cutting remark that’ll bleed for days.</p><p>She’s brought back by the sharp inhale Rio takes through her nose and lets out through her mouth. It’s how she calms herself down. How she always has. Her tongue darts out to wet her lips before she speaks.</p><p>“Agatha,” she starts again, steadier this time. “This is the cafe closest to my office. Peggy is my new employee, and I’m conducting her three month check in meeting. I’m not– we’re not– she’s married. To a man.” Rio stumbles over her words and then, as if realizing how exposed she’s left herself, drops Agatha’s sweatshirt and straightens before tossing the paper towel she’s been using easily into the trash can on the opposite wall, freeing her arms up to cross over her chest defensively. Agatha feels the absence of her touch immediately, like something vital has been carved out of her.</p><p>She tries not to feel the relief that washes over her at Rio’s assertion. At the adamance in her tone. Agatha builds the wall between them higher instead, desperate to force out the feeling.</p><p>“It wouldn’t matter if you were. We don’t owe each other anything,” she retorts, condescension dripping from her words. Rio merely stares down at her. Though they're no longer touching, Rio's still close enough that Agatha can see the amber and gold flecks in her dark irises, shifting as they search her face. What she’s looking for, Agatha can’t tell.</p><p>Rio looks formidable, their height difference more apparent than usual with the boost from her heeled boots. An impassive queen surveying an unruly subject. In the past three years Rio seems to have perfected the art of staring Agatha down like this, breaking her down to nothing with only a look. <em> You don’t scare me</em>, Agatha wants to scream at her, but she's already dug herself a deep enough hole for today.</p><p>“I know,” Rio settles on at last, though her words feel weightier than just the small sentiment.</p><p>Agatha presses the side of her fist against the damp spot left on her thigh by the spill, running her skin over the rough denim in hopes of soothing the mounting anxiety in her chest without having to show it. There is something else to be said, she knows. There is always something else to be said.</p><p>Rio, having said her piece, takes a half step back and holds her hand out, waiting. Agatha meets her outstretched palm, unfurling her fist and dropping the dirty paper towel. Rio merely tosses it into the trash bin like the one before, effortless, her arm flexing just slightly with the motion. She doesn’t pull her eyes away from where the paper arced through the air, ignoring Agatha’s lingering gaze on her face.</p><p>“Use the stain remover in the green tube and throw it all in the wash when you get home. It should come out pretty easily,” she says. Her tone is neutral, if not a bit relieved, like she’s surprised to be escaping this encounter in more or less one piece.</p><p>When she turns and strides back toward the door to leave, something dormant in Agatha stirs to life with an immediate level-five-alarm sort of panic. Maybe it’s her fight or flight trigger, finally remembering that it knows how to work after shirking its duty for so long. Fitting that it would get its shit together right now, of all times.</p><p>As if in a trance, Agatha lunges forward, closing her fingers around Rio’s wrist like a vice. She freezes beneath the touch, one hand still on the door handle, and turns to look at Agatha over her shoulder. Waiting.</p><p>The gravity of what she’s done washes over her like ice water. Agatha had not thought this far. She hadn’t thought at all, really– she just knew that she didn’t want to end on that strange, almost friendly note.</p><p><em> Yes</em>, that was it, she couldn’t have Rio thinking they were friends now. Can’t have her getting ideas about things changing. Agatha digs for sharp words to hurl but comes up empty, her brain still running ten seconds behind, her mouth opening and closing again without sound.</p><p>Rio’s focus flits between Agatha’s eyes like she’s listening to her thoughts in real time. Finally, she relaxes, no longer rigid beneath Agatha’s touch.</p><p>“This doesn’t have to mean anything,” she says softly, almost tender. Agatha visibly calms, her grip slackening around Rio’s wrist. She knows what she’s really saying is <em> we can go back to the cycle. Today doesn’t mean things have to change. I'll keep coming home again, and again and again until you forgive me. Or even if you never do. I am not expecting either of us to be kind now because of this.</em></p><p>For just a moment their eyes meet, and Agatha allows herself to dip her chin in the ghost of a nod. An acknowledgement that she has heard. Rio returns the gesture before turning the handle, slipping out of the bathroom and out of Agatha’s grasp.</p><p>Agatha gives herself twenty full minutes to stand in the bathroom willing herself not to throw up or put her fist through the glass of the mirror. When finally she goes back out, she sweeps her laptop back into her bag and shoves her coat under her arm with little ceremony. The table where Rio and Skirt Suit– no, Peggy– had been sitting is now occupied by an elderly man, cupping a steaming mug in one hand and reading a book with the other. She’s still contemplating the merits of arson when she pushes back out through the door and into the parking lot, vowing never to return to that awful place and yet mourning having to add to her already overflowing drawer of Things Not to Think About.</p><p>When she pulls the sweatshirt out of the wash that evening, having begrudgingly followed Rio’s advice, there is no trace of her coffee left behind. Almost like it had never happened at all.</p>

<p>Even beneath the harsh spray of the pressure washer, the muck refuses to budge. Agatha stands patiently still on the front porch, intent on her task until finally the grime gives way. The hum of the engine vibrates the wooden slats beneath her old yard work sneakers, her mind lulled into a focused calm by the rhythmic, thoughtless task.</p><p>Now that March is well underway and the world is starting to thaw, the growing list of chores that Agatha’s been putting off can no longer be ignored, driving her to dedicate her entire Saturday to shrinking her to-do list.</p><p>Luckily there’s no need for her to break out the lawnmower quite yet with the grass just barely starting to come back to life, but months of dirt and grime have seemingly been pressed into every crevice of her house’s facade by the winter’s relentless snow and frigid rain.</p><p>With the cushion covers for the rocking chairs nearly done in the wash and the porch railing thoroughly scrubbed, her final– and most time consuming– task is pressure washing the porch itself, restoring the wood to its usual soft shine.</p><p>Even in her worst moments, Agatha has never been able to let the house fall into disrepair. Even though it’s twice as many chores as it used to be. Maybe it’s because, subconsciously, she’s still waiting for Nicky to come home and she wants it to look how he remembers it. Or maybe that’s just what the shrink she’d briefly tried out had suggested after Agatha complained to him about having to figure out how to plant the right flowers in the garden and keep them alive. She’d stopped seeing him not long after.</p><p>Maybe Agatha just wants to live in a clean fucking house, thank you very much. </p><p>She’s lost in the tangle of her thoughts– that asshat therapist, moving the laundry to the dryer, Nicky– and doesn’t catch that she has a visitor until she pauses the spray to check the timer on her phone, nearly jumping out of her skin when she turns and sees a figure out of the corner of her eye. Thankfully, Agatha’s sense of dignity keeps her both rigid and silent.</p><p>Her neighbor from the house at the end of the street, Wanda Maximoff, stands at the foot of the brick porch steps, just out of range of Agatha’s pressure washer. Her hands are stuffed into the pockets of her red zip up jacket, a pair of perfectly unscuffed tennis shoes peeking out from beneath her black yoga pants. Clearly she must have been in the middle of some sort of power walk, though not a single strand of auburn hair has escaped from her ponytail. A small, almost shy smile plays at her lips as she pulls one hand free to wiggle her fingers in greeting.</p><p>“Hey, Agatha.”</p><p>They had been something almost like friends, once. But that was a long time ago, and Agatha’s not sure she’d be willing to admit such a thing even under threat of violence. Wanda’s boys are only two years younger than Nicky was, Agatha remembers, and she finds her thoughts almost slipping away to think of what they must look like now, closing in on double digits. She snaps herself back.</p><p>“Did you need something?” Agatha calls bluntly over the drone of the pressure washer, unwilling to turn it off and accidentally seem willing to socialize. Wanda rolls her eyes, but her smile doesn’t drop.</p><p>That’s the thing about Wanda, Agatha thinks. She’s a persistent bitch. She had tried to come around after Nicky died, offering a warm embrace at his funeral and home cooked meals silently left at the front door with small, encouraging notes in the weeks after.</p><p>Wanda had tried to come by when Rio left too, noticing the clear absence of the Subaru in the driveway and knocking on Agatha’s door to see if she was alright. Agatha had ignored her every time, crumpling her notes without reading them and avoiding eye contact when they passed one another on the sidewalk. </p><p>She didn’t want to hear Wanda offer her empty platitudes or scold her for being a recluse behind the guise of pity. She didn’t want to hear about Vision’s misadventures at work or how her boys were doing in school. Wanda had eventually taken the hint and stopped trying. Or so Agatha had thought.</p><p>“I haven’t seen you around in a while, and it’s harder for you to ignore me when I’m actually in front of you,” Wanda calls back, undeterred by Agatha’s harsh tone. If anything, she looks pleased.</p><p>“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Agatha sniffs, placing her free hand on her hip. Wanda’s smile only grows and she pulls her other hand out of her pocket, beginning to count on her fingers.</p><p>“Really? Because if I recall, you ignored the notes that I left, the texts I sent, my calls, dozens of attempts to say hello on the sidewalk, holiday party invites–” Agatha cuts her off with a groan, finally flicking the engine off and throwing the tool down, striding to stand at the top of the stairs. She crosses her arms and stares down at Wanda.</p><p>“Fine, you’ve got my attention. What do you want?” Wanda puts her hands back in her pockets, rocking on her toes. The picture of innocence.</p><p>“I want to hang out. I figured we could catch up.”</p><p>Agatha barks an incredulous laugh at her. “No. Absolutely not.” </p><p>Still, Wanda doesn’t waver.</p><p>“I thought you might say that. So I came prepared to bargain,” Wanda shrugs, like Agatha has forced her hand. Agatha merely lifts a brow, waiting. When Wanda’s polite smile turns sharper, she knows well enough to be nervous.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness, if you do not spend the afternoon with me right now I will have no choice but to tell the Boy Scouts <em> and </em> the Girl Scouts to put your house back into their door-to-door sales rotation.” At Agatha’s shocked face, Wanda’s eyes seem to sparkle with pride.</p><p>“Bet you never stopped to wonder how you’d gotten away with such blissful silence these past few years, did you? Don’t make me take it away.” Agatha gets herself together, narrowing her eyes at Wanda.</p><p>“You wouldn’t.”</p><p>Wanda clicks her tongue. “You know I would.”</p><p>They stand at a stalemate, tension far too palpable for a Saturday in suburbia pulling the moment taut. Finally, the alarm on Agatha’s phone goes off, signaling that the laundry is ready to be moved. She sighs, pinching the bridge of her nose between her thumb and pointer finger.</p><p>Which would be worse– several uninterrupted hours alone with her bubbly neighbor, or a barrage of children in wrinkled uniforms pounding on her door all year and begging her to spend her hard earned money on overpriced garbage? Agatha turns the alarm off with a long suffering sigh.</p><p>“Okay, Wanda. Come on in.”</p><hr/><p>Agatha turns the knob on the dryer, closing her eyes and taking a deep breath as it rocks to life. She can do this– sit here and listen to Wanda babble about whatever she wants for an hour or two and then fake a headache and kick her out. Easy.</p><p>When she gets back down the stairs and into the living room, she’s surprised to find Wanda isn’t there. Instead she’s standing in the kitchen in front of the fridge, holding both doors open and wearing a contemplative frown on her face.</p><p>“Looking for anything in particular?” Agatha asks, disbelieving her clear lack of boundaries. Instead of having the decency to look embarrassed, Wanda simply turns to look at her with the same expression.</p><p>“I was hoping to find literally anything other than whatever mold experiment you’ve got growing in that tupperware in the back,” Wanda says, wrinkling her nose. She shuts the fridge, but not before pulling out the bottle of wine sitting in the door and setting it on the counter near Agatha.</p><p>“Pour us some of this, would you? I’m going to order food from that Chinese place you like,” she says, not even looking up as she pulls out her phone and starts tapping away. Agatha feels torn between her annoyance at being bossed around in her own home and being genuinely impressed by Wanda’s complete refusal to abide by any of the rules of polite society.</p><p>Agatha does as she’s told and pulls two glasses down from the cabinet, giving them each a healthy pour and handing one to Wanda just as she wraps up the order on her phone and pockets the device once more. Wanda offers a bright, genuine smile as she takes the glass from Agatha’s hand, clinking their drinks together before taking a sip. Agatha opens her mouth to speak but Wanda beats her to it.</p><p>“Do you remember the time Sharon tried to host a book club and you and I went just to get drunk off of the fancy ass wine she keeps in her cellar? She asked you what you thought about Moby Dick and you said ‘honestly, Sharon, I don’t know anyone named Moseby and I certainly don’t know a thing about dick.’ She was so mad she almost cried and I think I actually pissed myself laughing,” Wanda recounts, slurring her words while she quotes Agatha and grinning into her drink.</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitch up of their own accord, the use of the muscles feeling strange after so long. It feels almost nice to hear Wanda talk about the way that she used to be, loud and brash and unapologetic. But she hasn’t been that person in years. Still unapologetic, certainly, but now her sharpness isn’t blunted behind her wit. Now she’s all teeth.</p><p>“Do you not have a life to get back to? Kids and a husband and probably some yappy little dog? Why are you really here?” Agatha asks, her words coming out more tired than she would like. She waits for Wanda to drop the act and confess that she feels bad for not monitoring Agatha more closely or that she had seen her on the porch when she walked by and couldn’t help but feel pity. It never comes.</p><p>“Don’t be a bitch,” Wanda replies breezily, leaning back against the counter and making herself comfortable.</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>“Excused. I’ve given you space and time, thinking maybe you just needed to ride some things out on your own for a bit before coming back. But I see now that that was never your plan. Whatever dreams you had of becoming some fucked up urban legend type are officially over,” she announces with an air of finality before looking Agatha dead in the eyes, suddenly serious.</p><p>“You can’t keep everyone out forever, Agatha. You can’t keep <em> me </em> out forever.”</p><p>Agatha scoffs at Wanda’s audacity, her insistence that she matters here in some way. That any of this is about her at all. Agatha takes a sip of her wine before pinning her with an icy glare.</p><p>“You can tell yourself whatever helps you sleep better at night, Maximoff, but I’ve only agreed to one afternoon of this shit. Unless you’ve got more bribes up your sleeve, this is all the time you’re going to get,” Agatha tells her, voice cool and indifferent. Wanda merely shrugs, tossing back her wine and pouring herself more.</p><p>The food arrives not long after and Wanda goes to the door to retrieve it, thanking the delivery man with a smile before carrying the hefty paper bag to the living room, setting it proudly on the coffee table. Wanda maneuvers through the space like she belongs, like this sort of thing is something that they do together often and not something Agatha has been forced into at metaphorical gunpoint. Resigned to her fate, Agatha moves to the couch, sinking into the plush sofa and watching Wanda unpack everything.</p><p>The woman has ordered a veritable feast– hot containers of orange chicken, lo mein, veggie fried rice and wonton soup among other things litter the wooden surface, filling the room with warm, mouth-watering aromas as Wanda cracks each of them open.</p><p>They don’t bother with getting plates, instead leaning across the coffee table to reach everything and picking bites from the various containers. It reminds Agatha of her early twenties, a lifetime ago.</p><p>To Agatha’s surprise and relief, Wanda doesn’t talk about her kids, or the past, or Rio, or any of the other gargantuan elephants that Agatha skirts around. She catches Agatha up on neighborhood gossip, like so-and-so getting fined by the HOA for tanning topless in their front yard and Sharon accidentally driving her car through her own garage door when she thought she was in reverse.</p><p>Loose from the wine and a full stomach, Agatha lets herself lower her defenses a bit and relax. By the time Wanda tells her about Ralph falling off of a float and breaking his arm while playing Santa in the Christmas parade, Agatha laughs so hard that she snorts.</p><p>The sound feels foreign to her ears, her own joy startling her out of her relaxed state. Agatha thinks to be embarrassed, to pull the wall right back up, but Wanda is just laughing along with her, entirely unaware of Agatha’s internal battle. She feels lighter, then, even if only slightly. A rock or two lifted from the pile on her chest.</p><p>The moment passes and their laughter dies down, and Agatha watches as Wanda prods at a piece of chicken with her chopsticks, her expression turning serious in a way that Agatha can’t read. Very quietly, in a small, unsure voice that Agatha doesn’t think she’s ever heard her use, she confesses, “I used to have a brother. A twin.”</p><p>They’ve never discussed Wanda’s childhood before and Agatha has never pressed, mostly because she has never wanted to risk talking about her own. Even now, Agatha does not prod. Wanda turns her head, staring past her through the window and out into the backyard.</p><p>“He was the only family that I had left. In my eyes, he held the world in his hands. Even when we had nothing, he made me feel like no dream was too big for me to chase.” Wanda’s eyebrows pinch together, but still she doesn’t look at Agatha, clearly lost in memory. Agatha doesn’t notice she’s stopped breathing.</p><p>“When he died, it was like everything good and safe in the world had died with him. There had never been a version of me that existed without Pietro, and I didn’t want there to be.”</p><p>Finally Wanda looks back at her. There’s something unguarded in her eyes– something raw that Agatha’s never seen. It reminds her of that thing she can see in Rio that nobody else seems to, like she’s been shattered and glued back together again but not all of the pieces are in the right spots anymore.</p><p>Agatha feels like she’s peeking behind the curtain at something that was not meant for her eyes, but Wanda doesn’t waver or back down.</p><p>“Soon, I will have been grieving him for longer than he was ever alive. Pietro was dead long before the boys were born– before I ever met Vision, even. Nobody in my life knew him but me, so his loss is a weight I’ve always had to carry alone. I can’t help but wonder sometimes if it would’ve been any easier if there had been just one other person that understood.”</p><p>Agatha knows, of course, what Wanda is saying. Knows the weight of her words and sees the act of surrender in shedding the outer layers of her skin to show Agatha her soft, vulnerable center. She swallows, searching for the right thing to say.</p><p>“I’m sure he’d be very proud of you. Of the life you’ve built,” she offers, the words sounding lame and inadequate to her own ears. But Wanda reaches over with shimmering eyes to take Agatha’s hand in her own, squeezing it tightly before letting it drop.</p><p>Wanda breathes like she’s gathering herself back together, and just like that she’s back to her casual, lighthearted demeanor. She pushes up from the couch, taking both of their wine glasses to the kitchen and setting them in the sink before returning, standing across the table from where Agatha sits.</p><p>Agatha is relieved to see the sort of quiet tranquility back on Wanda’s face. She almost forgets that she’s supposed to be annoyed to have her here.</p><p>“You should come on a walk with me some time,” she says. And then, as if reading Agatha’s mind, she adds, “or the other option is for me to keep showing up here unannounced and forcing you to spend indefinite amounts of time with me like this. Your choice!” Her voice is a happy chirp, intentionally pitched up to get on Agatha’s nerves.</p><p>Agatha grumbles out some sort of noncommittal agreement and Wanda bids her a polite goodbye in return, letting herself out and returning the house to its usual quiet. Agatha pushes the noodles in front of her around with her chopsticks and notes with a look at her watch that three hours have passed. Begrudgingly, she admits to herself that it hadn’t been <em> entirely </em> awful to have another living person in her house for a bit with no obvious ulterior motives at play.</p><p>She gathers the takeout containers and seals them shut before piling them in the fridge, hoping she’ll remember to eat at least some of them before they go bad. Agatha rinses the wine glasses out in the sink and washes her hands, letting her mind wander.</p><p>She tries to picture a man with Wanda’s face, handsome and bright, maybe a redhead or a brunette. She wonders how Wanda might be different if he had lived– if she would have still come by today and made all of those attempts to reach out, or if she wouldn’t have been so persistent without the steady thrum of her own grief to remind her.</p><p>Agatha wonders, for the first time, if maybe other people also feel a bit like an unforgivable monster, trapped in their own towers built from the nightmarish memories that they can’t escape. Maybe they’re all just doing a better job at hiding it than she is.</p><p>She clears the thought with a shake of her head. It must be the wine talking, she decides. Just stupid tipsy sentimentality that will surely be banished with a good old fashioned couch nap.</p>

<p>When Agatha wakes to a knock at her door the sun has already set, leaving the living room lit only by the moonlight falling through the windows and pooling on the floor. She rubs blearily at her eyes with the heels of her palms, trying to orient herself. Checking her watch, she sees it’s already close to seven. Her couch nap had turned into a bit of a couch sleep, it seems.</p><p>The remnants of a dream pull at her mind on its way out– she had been chasing something, running after it with all of her might to no avail. A flash of green ahead of her in a forest and just out of reach, roots and vines catching on her legs and face as she crashed through. The pieces make no sense to Agatha as they fade, but the lingering frustration stays in her body.</p><p>The knock comes again, a relentless pounding against the wood of the door that aggravates Agatha’s quickly forming headache. Wanda must have forgotten something earlier and come back for it, but Jesus <em> Christ </em>did she have to be so intense about it?</p><p>Agatha stands from the couch, pushing the hair back from her face and straightening out her oversized t-shirt with a tug, still dressed in her yard work clothes. She walks through the house and throws the door open without sparing a glance, launching straight into her tirade.</p><p>“Wanda, what could you <em> possibly</em>–” Agatha stops in the middle of her sentence when her brain finally catches up to what her eyes have found. It’s not Wanda at her door, but Rio.</p><p>Rio stands with her fist still raised, dressed in a navy suit like she’s just come from work even though it’s a Saturday night and clutching a briefcase in her right hand. Agatha is so confused by the whole scene that she forgets her snark and instead wonders if she’s still dreaming on the couch.</p><p>She doesn’t fight it when Rio simply pushes in past her, not stopping to take off her black pumps in the entryway like she’s supposed to and instead curving straight to the dining room, where she sets the briefcase down on the table and begins spinning the combination lock with her thumb until it clicks open.</p><p>Agatha closes the door and follows her dumbly, stopping in the archway between the dining room and the foyer to watch her pull a stack of papers out of a manila folder. She doesn’t get any further than the <em> what </em> in <em> what the actual fuck are you doing right now </em> before Rio cuts her off, speaking at last.</p><p>“There’s a class action lawsuit against the fertility clinic.” Her voice is serious, taking on an almost frenzied edge as she spreads the papers from the folder out on the wood, sliding them away from herself and toward the end of the table closest to Agatha.</p><p>Agatha already feels on edge, first from her afternoon with Wanda and now Rio’s baffling entrance. This is not how they do things– Rio is supposed to show up calm, vulnerable but still calculated. They don’t talk about things that are real and they certainly do not wear this much clothing for this long. Rio seems to be sweating slightly, nearly manic with whatever she’s trying to say. Agatha finds it off putting, like she’s not entirely sure what to expect from her now.</p><p>Never one to lose her composure, Agatha takes two tentative steps forward and squints down at the papers, trying in vain to decipher the print without the help of her glasses. Rio, of course, catches her struggle.</p><p>“Multiple families that used sperm or egg donors from the Perlman Clinic have reported health issues with their kids. They think that the clinic has been intentionally failing to report abnormal test results from donors’ genetic screening panels so they could add them to their bank anyway Or maybe even foregoing the testing entirely and bullshitting the results.”</p><p>Rio stops then, holding herself rigid while she clenches and unclenches her fists mechanically. Agatha can see her pulse jumping in her throat, like she’s ready to vibrate out of her skin. Agatha leans forward, gripping the back of the nearest dining chair until her knuckles turn white while she lets herself fully absorb what she’s hearing.</p><p>The clinic. The donors and their potential unreported genetic abnormalities. The words the doctors had said to her that had washed over her like white noise, none of it actually making any sense until days later. <em> A genetic trigger. Nothing that they could have caught in time, even if they’d known where to look. </em></p><p>His little body still in his dinosaur pajamas, looking more small and fragile than she’d ever seen on the sterile hospital bed between them, getting colder and colder as the minutes ticked by. The way that the hospital staff had gently tried to prod them into letting him go and Rio had blown up so spectacularly that Agatha had almost been concerned that they would call the police. Instead, they had apologized profusely, leaving Agatha and Rio alone with him for the rest of the night. No one blames a grieving mother, she had learned.</p><p>Other memories try to slip in through the gap that the first has left open, clawing viciously at the back of her mind. Agatha squeezes her eyes shut, unwilling to live them all out again.</p><p>“It would help if we joined them. If we told his story,” Rio says softly, her voice full of conviction. Rage balloons and explodes so quickly inside of Agatha’s chest that the snarl that rips free from her almost comes as a shock.</p><p>“Absolutely the fuck not.” Her eyes fly open and find Rio’s– white hot fury meeting cool determination. Rio’s composure in the face of her rage only bolsters her desire to draw blood. Agatha releases the chair and turns toward her.</p><p>“Who would it help, Rio? Your conscience? Your insatiable hero complex? Because it certainly wouldn’t help me. It certainly wouldn’t help <em> him.</em>”</p><p>Agatha is on a tear now. Rio falters slightly, her hands curling more tightly in on themselves. <em> Good</em>. Agatha sinks her claws in further, going for the kill.</p><p>“Have you been fired or something? So desperate for money that you’d profit off of your son’s death like he’s some fucking data error? Some faulty equipment from a lazy manufacturer?” She hisses.</p><p>“STOP IT,” Rio bellows at her, her booming voice filling the space around them. Agatha’s jaw clicks shut so fast that her teeth ache and she flinches back, so unaccustomed to hearing her take that tone. There are unshed tears welling up in Rio’s eyes and her nostrils are flared, her chest rising and falling rapidly with her shallow breaths. If Agatha didn’t know any better, she’d think someone had thrust an actual knife between her ribs.</p><p>“Don’t you <em> ever </em> fucking talk about him like that to me again. I can take a lot of shit from you, Agatha, but not that. Never that.”</p><p>Rio is shaking. She runs her fingers through her hair, disturbing the glossy waves and leaving it wild. Agatha has the decency to keep her mouth tightly shut, swallowing her vitriol back down and letting it burn her esophagus in penance. The room is quiet as Rio calms her breathing down, waiting until she’s regulated herself before speaking again.</p><p>“It would help the families who still have their children, Agatha. The parents who are going to use the clinic’s donors deserve to know exactly whose DNA will be in their child. Nobody deserves what happened to Nicky. What happened to us.”</p><p>Agatha can hear the logic behind the sentiment. Truly, she understands the point Rio is trying to make and the intention behind her actions. Still, she can’t let it go. She can’t articulate why either, not without showing her carefully held cards.</p><p>Instead, she settles on a mumbled “we don’t even know if it was the donor’s fault.”</p><p>This, of course, is the worst possible thing she could say. Reaching her whole hand into the gaping, infected wound they share and pawing tactlessly at its gory center.</p><p>Rio recoils as if slapped, her eyes widening in horror. Agatha wonders if Rio must spend all of her time trying not to think about it too, furiously swimming away from the whirlpool– not to gain any true distance, but to avoid being sucked even further down into its mouth. Here she is anyway, tying rocks to both of their ankles and sending them careening into the inky waters.</p><p>“You know what Agatha?” Rio starts, pausing to prod at the inside of her cheek with her tongue when her voice cracks on the words. “You’re right.”</p><p>Somewhere inside of Agatha, a door slams shut, rattling on its hinges. The force of it ricochets through the hollow space where her heart used to sit. But Rio keeps talking.</p><p>“We shouldn’t have used my egg. Even though I passed all of the tests it was still a risk we shouldn’t have taken, not knowing anything about my family history. I forced your hand when I knew you were nervous, and now our son is dead. So you’re right, and I’ll never for a moment not feel that guilt.”</p><p>Silent tears slide down Rio’s cheeks and the broken look in her eyes is on full display for Agatha, the depths of her agony laid bare. Agatha feels like the whole world has shifted on its axis and they’ve been thrown into some new version of reality where everything is hideously wrong.</p><p>Because the words Rio is saying make no sense at all. The concept is so unimaginable she almost wonders if she’s begun to hallucinate, if the wine she’d had earlier was so long expired it had turned lethal. She tugs at the thousands of thoughts running through her mind but none of them untangle long enough to become words that make it to her mouth. Agatha tries anyway, parting her lips in hopes that something makes it through.</p><p>“Rio, that’s not what–” but Rio just holds up a hand, silencing her. Her lips press together and Agatha watches her jaw work for a moment while she waits with bated breath.</p><p>“I do not want to talk about this,” Rio intones, her voice surprisingly steady. “I do not give a fuck about being the monster in your narrative anymore. This is about him. Not you.”</p><p>Her tone drips with condescension as she seals herself off, putting her armor back on and brandishing her weapon. At the sight, Agatha forgets her moment of empathy. Her anger returns in full to replace it.</p><p>Today was supposed to be simple– chores, check marks on her to-do list, maybe some shitty TV and a hot shower before bed. Not an attack from Wanda, or a wine-induced stress dream, or Rio showing up not to fuck but to commit an act of terrorism. All of it burns beneath her skin like a thousand miniscule cuts, making it hard to breathe.</p><p>She meets Rio’s eyes, which are back to being unreadable. Unforgiving. “Get out,” she whispers. The fight has drained out of them both and Rio merely nods, like it’s what she was expecting Agatha to say.</p><p>Rio returns the empty folder to her briefcase and clicks it shut, leaving the stack of papers on the table. She slides the bag back into her hand, straightening her posture and flicking her hair back off of her shoulders, pulling herself back together manually.</p><p>“Okay, Agatha. I’m meeting with the lawyer and the lead plaintiffs next month to hear where they’re at with the case so far. The details are in there,” she says, gesturing toward the pages. “You don’t have to come, but I think you should.”</p><p>She doesn’t look back at Agatha as she breezes past, the smell of her perfume lingering even as the sound of her heels on the hardwood echoes back to the foyer and out the front door.</p><p>Agatha stands still, watching the space where Rio had been standing until she hears the car engine come to life outside and roll back down the driveway. It feels as though her skin has been unzipped and all of the shattered mosaic pieces inside of her have been left scattered on the floor, their jagged edges waiting to dig into the meat of her palms when she sweeps them up again.</p><p>When it feels like she can breathe normally again, Agatha retrieves her glasses from the living room and walks back to the table, sifting through the papers with shaking hands. Rio’s words echo back in her head, about how there are other children to help. Other parents who could have the chance to know that their baby is sick.</p><p>She thinks of her beautiful boy in the only suit that he owned, pale and gaunt in a casket, and how maybe if someone had raised an alarm flag sooner there could’ve been a different outcome. Agatha knows it’s far-fetched, but still the idea refuses to leave her mind, turning over and over again like a river-smoothed stone.</p><p>Carefully, she shuffles the pages back into a neat stack before carrying and depositing them into the tray on her kitchen counter filled with old birthday and Christmas cards, receipts and gift cards and keys she couldn’t match to their locks if she tried. A place where pending things go until she can make a decision.</p><p>With a sigh, Agatha forces her tired body up the stairs and drags herself into the shower, letting the scalding water stream over her skin while she presses her forehead to the cool tile wall. Letting the final dregs of her anger simmer out and slither down the drain.</p><p>She doesn’t understand why Rio would do this– show up at her door with those papers, evangelizing to her about the lawsuit like she could sway Agatha’s mind. Like they were still some sort of team. And then to yell, turning herself into the perfect picture of righteous indignation.</p><p>What was she expecting? This is all that they do– they fight and they fuck, in that order. Or at least they <em> did</em>. Now Rio hadn’t come around since November, and then tonight she’d left without even grazing Agatha.</p><p>That can be fine, Agatha decides, letting her muscles finally relax beneath the water. Rio doesn’t have to fuck her anymore if she doesn’t want to. The world will keep spinning, she tells herself. It’s probably for the best.</p><p>With her decision made, Agatha pushes back off of the shower wall and gets to the task of washing her body, soaping down her chest and arms, pointedly ignoring how sensitive her nipples are when her fingers slip over them. <em> Just the body reacting to a pattern</em>, she tells herself. <em> A Pavlovian response</em>.</p><p>But when Agatha gets to the slick heat at the apex of her thighs, her ministrations come to a stuttering halt. Her clit throbs from the barest brush of pressure and she closes her eyes against the sensation, biting her lip to hold in the moan that threatens to leave her. <em> Just the body reacting to a pattern. </em></p><p>Maybe it would be for the best, a way to get her mind off of her fucked up day and release some of the tension. <em> It doesn’t have to be anything more than that</em>. The notion momentarily soothes the voice in her head.</p><p>Agatha uses the lull to bring her right hand back up to her breast, kneading the flesh indulgently before pinching her nipple between her fingers and tugging, this time not caring to suppress her moan. Her hips cant forward of their own volition, and she obliges by sliding her left hand back between her legs. A gasp passes through her lips when she feels just how wet she is, her fingers gliding through her folds with no resistance.</p><p>Agatha parts herself with two fingers, dragging her middle finger from her entrance up through her slit to gather the wetness pooled there and spread it up to the bundle of nerves. She whimpers at the touch, expertly circling her clit and reveling in the heat blooming low in her stomach.</p><p>Unbidden, the image of Rio standing at the door in her suit flashes in her mind’s eye– the exposed skin of her throat beneath the collar of her blouse and her strong fingers wrapped around the handle of her briefcase.</p><p>“<em>No</em>,” Agatha says aloud to herself, her voice harsh in the quiet of the bathroom. Her body seems to disagree, though, as a fresh wave of wetness gushes forward and starts to drip down her thighs. Her clit throbs beneath her touch at the thought of those strong fingers inside of her. <em> No no no no no. </em></p><p>Agatha shuts her eyes tightly, forcibly clearing the image from her mind and trying to draw something else forth instead, something safe like porn or Cate Blanchett in a suit or even just the concept of fucking a stranger in a bar bathroom. But they never come.</p><p>Instead, her mind supplies other ideas– Rio’s hands where hers are now, Rio’s tongue pressing into her cunt, Rio’s strap taking her from behind.</p><p>Agatha whines both in frustration and at her mounting orgasm, moving her left hand from her clit to press two fingers to her entrance and thrusting in at a punishing pace, hoping to lose herself to the sensation. She lets her other hand fall from her breast to her neglected clit, rubbing in tight, fast circles. She needs it to be over, needs her brain to stop making it worse before she enters truly dangerous territory.</p><p><em> Anything else</em>, she begs her brain as her stomach begins to tighten. <em> Literally anything else</em>.</p><p>But if there’s one thing that Agatha has always known, it’s that she’s never been able to trust her body. Not really.</p><p>So her brain offers its pièce de résistance with the full quality of a film playing on an IMAX screen with surround sound– Rio, writhing beneath her, hips thrashing against Agatha’s mouth as she comes apart against her tongue, her release spilling across Agatha’s face and chest and tongue and dripping down her chin. She can almost taste her, can almost hear her screaming in ecstasy.</p><p>Agatha cums to the memory so hard that her legs almost give out beneath her. She locks her knees and lets her head fall forward against the wall, shaking with the aftershocks. After several long minutes, Agatha pulls her fingers back out of herself slowly with a hiss and holds them under the cooling stream, letting the evidence of what she’s done disappear from her skin.</p><p><em> It doesn’t mean anything. Just more of the Pavlov shit</em>, she reminds herself, ignoring the twisting feeling low in her gut, like the orgasm hadn’t helped her and instead had made it all worse. Shame starts to burn at her cheeks, but Agatha reminds herself that nobody has seen, nobody is here to read her thoughts. Just her and this big empty house bearing witness to her sins.</p><p>She washes her hair in the now-frigid water and doesn’t make eye contact with herself in the bathroom mirror when she walks past. Agatha quickly braids her hair back with nimble fingers before letting the towel fall, leaving it crumpled on her bedroom floor as she crawls naked into the bed and pulls the covers up over her head.</p><p>It’ll be hours before her mind lets her sleep, but she closes her eyes anyway. </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>April second arrives as a bright, quiet Sunday morning.</p><p>Staring up to the meaningless constellations of her popcorn ceiling, Agatha listens to the gentle birdsong outside of her window, soaking in the calm before the day gets the chance to take its hold and push her beneath the waves. For now, she can tread water.</p><p>Twelve years ago, Agatha gave birth in the dead of night in a hospital room that boasted an obnoxious, oversaturated wallpaper covered in little cartoon ducklings. The labor had been gruesome– nearly fourteen hours– and Rio had sat with her through every contraction, every scream, every dig of nails into her arm.</p><p>When it was over and her son was in her arms, Agatha was sure that God must have made a mistake in gifting him to her. He was so perfect, too precious to be stained by her touch.</p><p>But there he was, settled against her chest, with wisps of dark hair just like Rio’s and a cherubic little nose that scrunched when he slept. Of course they’d used a donor, but Rio was adamant that he had Agatha’s eyes, her smile, her propensity for a good tantrum.</p><p>She had been so fucking exhausted. So obscenely, deliriously happy. Their baby, finally coming home to complete their family.</p><p>After nine long months of not sleeping on her stomach and having to waddle everywhere and suddenly hating all of her favorite foods. But also after the way Rio had picked her up and spun her around the bathroom screaming when the test came back positive, and their shared tears when they’d first felt him kick.</p><p>A memory rises of Rio skidding into the living room on socked feet, gap-toothed grin on full display, proclaiming that at 20 weeks along the baby could hear her talk to him now. She spent the rest of the pregnancy mumbling to him through Agatha’s belly, lips pressed to the skin to be sure he could make out every word.</p><p>The tides of her grief swell at the memory like a siren song, and when Agatha pulls herself from the bed the water has already risen to her underarms. She heads downstairs, going through to motions of making herself a cup of tea. Something simple, something thoughtless.</p><p>Nicky used to demand big pancake breakfasts on his birthday, the three of them dancing around the kitchen in chaotic harmony while Agatha made sure that nothing burned. Now the only sound to be heard is the whistle of the kettle.</p><p>But the quiet isn’t unwelcome, not really. It sits beside her on the counter like an old friend. Something she’s had years to grow accustomed to the feel of.</p><p>Idly, she wonders what theme he would have wanted for his party this year. Something comic book themed, or maybe baseball if he had kept up with it. Or maybe middle schoolers are too cool for their parties to have themes anymore, unwilling to stoop to such childish customs. Agatha wouldn’t know. She sips at her tea.</p><p>His first birthday was bunny themed because he’d seen a rabbit in a picture book from the library and had latched on, crying until they showed it to him again, running his chubby baby fingers over the glossy paper. She’d had to go back and return it just to check it out again at least five times before his obsession waned.</p><p>It’s not warm enough yet in Massachusetts to be considered a good day to spend outside, but the sun is shining against a cloudless blue sky, and it’s more than she’s gotten in previous years. Agatha gathers what she knows she’ll need, picking a book carefully from its designated spot and pulling an old pool towel from the linen closet before placing both in the worn tote bag she keeps by the door.</p><p>She throws her puffy black coat on over her white t-shirt and navy cardigan, making the last minute decision to grab an old throw blanket before heading out the door.</p><p>Her destination isn’t far– only a few miles out of the neighborhood– and Agatha takes the journey in silence instead of fiddling with the radio. Her fancy new car has a touch screen that she’s never truly figured out how to use, too accustomed to the knobs and dials of the Subaru.</p><p>Quiet, her old friend, adds to the feeling that the rest of the world is something separate today, something she doesn’t have to deal with just now. Today can belong to Nicky, like it’s supposed to.</p><p>Agatha’s car rolls through the gates of the cemetery and traces a familiar path to a spot beneath a broad oak tree, passing only a smattering of other cars on her way. Sundays are busier than usual with families penciling in their mourning in the slot after church.</p><p>She sees the Subaru first, then the shape huddled in the grass 30 yards away in the exact spot she’s headed to. With all of her might, Agatha resists the urge to smash her face against the steering wheel and scream. She doesn’t want to navigate this minefield, or let the vicious parts of herself out of their cage today. Agatha just wants to spend time with her son.</p><p>It’s that thought that propels her out of the car, stopping to grab her bag from the backseat before starting down the nearest row of headstones. Today is Nicky’s day, and they’ll both respect that. She hopes.</p><p>As she gets closer, Agatha can see that Rio isn’t sitting on a blanket or towel or folding chair of any kind, just the seat of her jeans in the dirt, her knees tucked up to her chest with her arms wrapped around them. Her hair is pulled back in a loose ponytail, the wind whipping strands out and into her face.</p><p>Here, like this, she’s not the formidable business woman that Agatha’s had to deal with lately. Here, she’s Just Rio. A better opponent in some ways. Worse in others.</p><p>When she reaches the spot next to her, Agatha drops her bag and bends over to pull out the towel. Rio jumps like she hadn’t noticed her approaching before sheepishly scooting over slightly– no further away from Nicky, but enough to give Agatha room to sit.</p><p>Agatha lays the towel out before sitting down gingerly, wrapping her coat tighter around herself and silently thanking past-Agatha for making the choice to wear it. Out of the corner of her eye, she takes Rio in, sitting there in only a light zip up jacket over her t-shirt, the flimsy garment hanging open and nearly slipping off of one shoulder. She won’t say anything, but Agatha can see that the tip of her nose and the tops of her ears are pink, her jaw clenching against her teeth attempting to chatter.</p><p>When she looks to the headstone again, Agatha lets her eyes follow the looping letters carved into the marble, tracing the shapes more than truly reading. And then her attention snags on the bright blooms freshly laid at the base of the stone, a radiant variety of pinks and blues and yellows. All of Nicky’s favorites.</p><p>Her sweet boy. Her attentive boy, who loved both of his mothers with a heart too big for his body. Who had not one but two mothers that had lost him. With a sigh, Agatha scoots to one side of the towel to make space.</p><p>“Get your ass out of the dirt,” she mutters, so low that it comes out as barely more than a whisper. She knows Rio hears.</p><p>Knows it because Rio whips her head to the side, wearing an expression not unlike a skittish horse being offered a sugar cube from a stranger’s hand.</p><p>“Are you sure? It’s fine if–”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha cuts her off, her impromptu spark of kindness fading quickly. “Shut the fuck up and come here.”</p><p>Rio unclasps her arms from around her knees long enough to scoot over and join her on the towel, though the thin fabric does little to block out the cold of the ground beneath them. She sits entirely rigid, like Agatha’s a predator she’s trying not to threaten.</p><p>Ignoring the tension radiating off of Rio, Agatha leans over and pulls the old throw blanket out of the bag next, draping one side across her own lap and throwing the other at Rio to do the same. Rio blinks, caught off guard, before gently folding the fabric over her legs and fisting it in her hands. They keep as much distance as possible from the other, but even that turns out to be less than a foot of space.</p><p>Finally settled, Agatha goes to pull the book out of her tote but hesitates with her arm outstretched, suddenly self conscious in a way she hadn’t expected to be.</p><p>Because she’s always been able to do this part alone, she realizes.</p><p>Rio and Agatha haven’t run into one another here in a long time. Not on his death date or his birthday or any of the other times Agatha comes to visit, which she is only now starting to realize might be odd. Her eyes flicker over to Rio and quickly away, not really even knowing what it is she would ask. Rio answers her anyway.</p><p>“Usually I come at the time he was born and sit with him then. But apparently they’ve been having some issues lately with teenagers coming here to drink and get high and shit like that, so they’re locking the gates at night now,” she explains with the tone of someone talking about the weather, picking absently at her nails instead of making eye contact.</p><p>But Agatha remembers how Rio used to climb out of bed and sneak into his room at the exact time listed on his birth certificate, whispering <em> happy birthday </em> to his little sleeping form and slipping right back out. Agatha had never brought it up, content to let it belong to the two of them.</p><p>Nicky had been born just after one in the morning, when all of the nurses in the delivery room looked almost as exhausted as Agatha felt. Rio used to joke that she’d held him in for the extra hour and change because she didn’t want to have an April Fools baby. When little ears were not around, Agatha would remind her that having a baby is not, in fact, like taking a shit, and that even if she <em> had </em> tried to hold him in, her pelvic floor was no match for his bowling ball head.</p><p>So she knows, on some level, what Rio has lost with the locking of the gate. How she must feel. Agatha almost wants to say sorry, but she’s not sure what for. Rio’s ritual with Nicky being disturbed? The fact that they have to be here together now? Every conversation they’ve had in the past three years?</p><p>No, none of it feels right. None of it would be enough, anyway.</p><p>“I read to him,” Agatha confesses instead, feeling both foolish and liberated by the admission. She forges on through her discomfort.</p><p>“We had just started <em> The Lightning Thief </em> when he– when it happened.” She tugs at the ends of her hair. An old habit. “Every year I read him the next few chapters.”</p><p>Agatha stares forward at the headstone again, if only to avoid looking over at Rio. She’s afraid of what she’ll find in those brown eyes–  probably something mocking. Or worse, something pitying.</p><p>But when Agatha flicks her attention back to her, all she can see are unshed tears, sitting patiently at Rio’s waterline while she watches her own fingers run through the blades of grass near her shoes.</p><p>After a suspended moment, Rio lets out a watery sigh. “Have you guys gotten to the tunnel of love yet?” She asks, turning her eyes up to meet Agatha’s curious gaze. “It’s my favorite part.”</p><p>Agatha feels the corners of her lips twitch up despite herself. She pulls the book from her bag, thumbing through the well worn pages to find where she’d dog eared their spot. Scanning the start of the chapter, she gives a nod, letting her fingers glide over the ink.</p><p>“You’re in luck. We’re just about there.”</p><p>When she looks up, Rio’s eyes are already on her, waiting. Confusion pulls at her for a second before she realizes Rio is waiting for her to start.</p><p>Agatha takes in her audience– first glancing to the headstone and then back to rio, chin resting on her knees, red rimmed eyes looking emptily at the flowers she undoubtedly brought him today. She starts reading.</p><p>They sit like that for what must be hours, the quiet but sure cadence of Agatha’s voice carrying through the air, accompanied every now and again by the sounds of birds moving through the trees or cars coming and going. Rio listens in enraptured silence until finally Agatha reaches the end of the chapter, folding down the corner of her page and closing the book before dropping it into her lap with a sigh.</p><p>Agatha’s throat stings from the exertion, but she realizes she feels a little lighter than she had this morning. The water is lower now, only waist high, the threat of drowning out of sight for now.</p><p>A squirrel runs up a nearby oak in the late afternoon sunlight, chattering and spiraling up the wide trunk. The moment is shattered by Agatha’s stomach growling loudly, disturbing the peace.</p><p>Rio’s lips curl slightly and she looks over to Agatha with one eyebrow raised. But it doesn’t feel malicious– it feels silly, reminiscent of a different place and time.</p><p>“Do you want to grab something to eat?” Rio asks. There is no trace of reluctance in her words, nothing to give away that it would be out of the ordinary. Maybe she’s forgotten who they are.</p><p>But Agatha has not forgotten and she tenses, an animal ready to flee. Rio’s face lights up in belated shock, like she’s finally heard herself.</p><p>“I mean– sorry– we don’t have to talk or anything. You don’t even have to look at me, if you don’t want. I just…” she tapers off, tucking the loose hair by her eyes back behind her ear, doing nothing to hide her nervousness.</p><p>“I want to do something that I think would make him happy. Or proud of us, I guess,” Rio finishes, her voice growing quieter.</p><p>Looking at her, Agatha muses that this might be the longest conversation that they’ve had since his death with nobody screaming or crying or taking their clothes off. It’s exactly as excruciating as she thought it’d be.</p><p>It would be best, certainly, not to tempt fate. To leave well enough alone. But when Agatha doesn’t give an answer right away, she witnesses the heartbreakingly miraculous act of Rio shrinking before her very eyes, curving in on herself until she’s something smaller, something less whole.</p><p>“Nevermind, just forget about it. It was a stupid idea,” she mumbles into her knees, drawing in a deep breath and shuffling like she’s preparing to get up from beneath the blanket.</p><p>It would be best not to tempt fate, but Agatha has never been one to do what was best. Just what she wanted.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Rio freezes, looking at her out of the corner of her eye.</p><p>“Okay?”</p><p>“That’s what I just said. Are you a parrot?” Rio’s lips merely curve into a shy smile. Something closer to relief than joy.</p><p>They settle on a diner not far away, and Rio folds the blanket while Agatha rolls up the towel. They work in silence, depositing the items back into Agatha’s tote and walking side by side back to the curb.</p><p>Rio offers her a tentative wave before they climb into their own cars and drive back out through the gates.</p><hr/><p>The drive to the diner is brief, but long enough that Agatha’s bubble of impulsivity has burst and she’s starting to wonder what the fuck she’s done by agreeing to this. She parks her sedan in the back of the lot and cuts the engine, giving herself a moment to gather her thoughts before facing whatever’s waiting for her inside.</p><p>Across the lot, the big block letters of the restaurant’s sign light up in the window of the glass door, faded almost a pastel pink from their original red. Agatha can see patrons dining in the booths through the big front windows that they’re pressed up against, nearly everything about the establishment unchanged from when she’d first visited.</p><p>Agatha and Rio had decided on a day trip out of the city, desperate to get away from campus and the strain of studying for midterms. The two of them couldn’t have been older than 19, and if she remembers right, they’d been dating for just under a year.</p><p>Rio had driven them out of the city at random, refusing to use any sort of GPS despite Agatha’s insistence. Rio drummed her fingers across Agatha’s thigh to the beat of the ABBA song vibrating through the stereo with one hand, settling the other low on the steering wheel while she drove.</p><p>The road had led them to a small but lively town no more than an hour and a half away, and they’d spent the day exploring its storefronts and niche local attractions. The decision to stop at the roadside diner before heading back was made on a whim, born mostly from a joke that it looked like something out of a cheesy Americana movie.</p><p>The toes of Agatha’s shoes just barely scraped the ground beneath the tall booth, her long hair curling over her shoulders and blanketing her arms when she peered down at the big glossy menu. They probably looked like two runaways– Agatha in her thin white tank top with a small embroidered snoopy on the front and Rio in a tight black workout top that showed the silhouette of her truly excessive muscularity and a pair of loose grey sweats.</p><p>Her raven hair was short enough then for the ends to curl up around her ears, doing nothing to hide the hickey that turned the entire right side of her neck purple-blue. Agatha wore a matching bruise, though it was only barely visible beneath the hem of her denim cutoffs.</p><p>She pretended to scan the menu, watching Rio beneath her eyelashes as she balled up the paper wrapper from her straw. The orange vinyl booth creaked beneath her when she shifted her weight, and her focus was broken when she heard the click of the waitress’ heels on the yellow-grey linoleum coming towards them.</p><p>The coffee that she held aloft on a tray smelled so strong that Agatha knew she was going to hate it before the mugs were even on the table. Without a word, Rio took Agatha’s mug and slid it over from where the waitress placed it, meticulously adding the perfect ratio of cream and sugar and mixing until she was satisfied before sliding it back to Agatha’s waiting hands.</p><p><em> I love you</em>, Agatha thought, though not for the first time. That was the first time she really thought she would say it, parting her lips and everything.</p><p>But the moment shifted– the couple in the booth behind them began to have an obnoxiously loud fight– and instead she watched as Rio wrinkled her nose to hold in a snort of laughter when one of them accused the other of something particularly ridiculous.</p><p>Agatha’s heart cracked open in her chest. She wanted to freeze them in that moment, sat together in the shitty diner with its too-strong coffee and the brush of their knees beneath the table forever, giggling endlessly at that couple's absurdity. Most of all, she wanted Rio to know that she loved her in the big, all-consuming, ‘fuck the rest’ sort of way that she used to think only existed in movies. Still, the words couldn’t seem to find their way out of her throat.</p><p>Rio had looked over, catching her eye and giving her that devastating lopsided grin– that gap-toothed smile that felt like being let in on a secret– and Agatha released a breath she hadn’t known she was holding.</p><p>It didn’t matter that she couldn’t say it right then, or even if she never could. Rio knew anyway.</p><p>Agatha crashes back into reality with the force of a semi truck, her hands gripping the wheel so tightly that her knuckles have turned white. This was the exact sort of thing that she shouldn’t be indulging in, the sort of thing that she had burned out of her heart and then sealed off the ashes of.</p><p>She finds her own eyes in the rearview mirror, holding that icy gaze. <em> You’re not that girl anymore</em>, the voice in her head reminds her, scraping the words against the walls of her skull like loose gravel. Not the girl who was moon-eyed and wanting, content with thinking that the universe would grant her nice things if only she could stick out the bad ones.</p><p>No, the woman she is now can’t feel a single goddamn thing more strongly than she feels the fear that the other shoe is going to drop, that things may yet find some impossible way to get worse the moment she lets her guard down. The terror of it rattles her teeth, follows her into every dream.</p><p>Hot on its heels is the anger. Always the rage, waiting to swallow her down its fire coated throat, reminding Agatha what was taken from her. Of how she knows, deep down, that it was her fault. Even if she didn’t know it then, she sure as hell knows it now.</p><p>Agatha looses a shaky exhale. She can’t sit in this diner with Rio and play happy couple, happy family. What they’d already done today had been nice enough, hadn’t it? Agatha had shared her ritual and avoided sinking her teeth or her claws into anything fragile, and Rio had let her have her time with Nicky without interfering.</p><p>They had both been there for him– the three of them celebrating his birthday together for the first time in four years. Nicky would have understood, maybe, with all of his 12-year-old wisdom, that some things were just too unbearable for her to endure.</p><p>A knock against her driver’s side window makes Agatha jump, shocked out of her own thoughts and back into her body once more. She turns her head to find Rio, standing hunched over so that her face is visible to Agatha through the glass, supporting her weight with a palm against the roof of the car.</p><p>More time must have passed than she thought– a quick glance to the dash confirms she’s been parked for nearly half an hour. Rio points, motioning for Agatha to roll the window down.</p><p>Agatha hesitates. It would be easier to just put her car back in drive and tear out of the lot, leaving Rio standing here to deal with the rest of the day on her own. But Agatha’s carefully constructed, arguably impenetrable steel wall won’t seem to build itself back to full height no matter how hard she tugs at it. Resigned to her fate, Agatha reasons she can do Rio the courtesy of saying <em> no thank you </em> before speeding off into the night.</p><p>She reaches over and presses the button on the door, rolling her window to half height and schooling her face into cool neutrality. It doesn’t matter, though. Rio has already seen her. Seen right through her, more like.</p><p>The smile Rio offers is sad and doesn’t quite meet her eyes, but Agatha finds no anger there. No regret. She holds up a brown paper bag that Agatha hadn’t noticed before, the bottom sagging beneath the weight of its contents and boasting a slight grease stain.</p><p>“I ordered your usual to go. Figured it beats whatever you have in the fridge,” she says, offering a slight shrug like the entire situation is casual.</p><p>Something in Agatha’s chest constricts at the gesture, a sharp echo of an old feeling. Rio’s eyes don’t waver from her face as Agatha lets the silence hang, just holding that same weight. The same quiet, steady knowing that says <em> I am going to fix your coffee how you like it before it ever reaches your hands. I ordered your usual because I know you weren’t ready for this and because I know you have no food at home. </em></p><p>Agatha shifts uncomfortably against her leather car seat. She hates it, more than anything, that she feels more naked now than she does with Rio’s hands on her bare skin.</p><p>She grits her teeth and rolls her eyes noncommittally at the gesture, but pushes the button to roll the window the rest of the way down so that Rio can hand her the bag. Agatha takes it and sets it on the passenger seat, but when she turns back Rio is reaching out of her line of sight for something else.</p><p>She straightens and offers her second gift– Agatha’s faded purple cardigan, neatly folded and freshly washed. It smells overwhelmingly like Rio– jasmine and clean soap and <em> Rio </em>– and Agatha uses all of her might to beat back every instinct to press it against her nose before setting it on the seat next to the bag. She leaves a careful gap between the two, not wanting the greasy diner food smell to taint the fabric.</p><p>Agatha turns back to Rio again, her finger hovering over the button and one eyebrow raised as if to say<em>, well? </em> In a gentler universe, Rio would take the hint and scamper off before Agatha’s resolve gives out and she does something stupid like weep or scream or throw a punch. In this one, she does no such thing.</p><p>“I think the theme for his party this year would be Percy Jackson, since he’s twelve in the first book,” is what she says instead. Agatha feels her tongue go leaden in her mouth.</p><p>“I know middle schoolers probably don’t really do themed stuff anymore, but I think maybe he would have. Don’t you?” Rio’s lips curl up in a soft, private smile as she breaks away from Agatha’s eyes to look down toward the concrete, her mind somewhere far away. When she looks back up, the smile is still there, a mischief Agatha hasn’t seen in years sparkling in her eyes.</p><p>“But I don’t think he’d pick a Greek god to be his secret parent and give him awesome powers. I think he’d just tell everyone they’re from you.”</p><p>Rio holds Agatha’s gaze for a moment before she leans back, giving the roof of Agatha’s car a final pat as she straightens up and brushes her hands on her jeans.</p><p>“Get home safe, Agatha. <em> Te veo</em>,” she says in parting, turning and walking back across the lot to where her car must be.</p><p>Rolling her window up with shaky fingers, Agatha tilts her head back against the headrest to fight back against the stinging in her eyes. She wonders if this is some long game Rio is playing, some fucked up ploy to whip Agatha into a heightened emotional state just to watch her shatter all over again.</p><p>Maybe their usual sadistic cycle isn’t enough for her anymore and she’s looking for new games to play. Or it’s revenge, maybe, for what Agatha had said when she’d last come over.</p><p>Agatha mulls it over so intensely that she feels the beginnings of a tension headache pressing in at her temples, prompting her to leave it alone. Whatever it is that Rio’s doing, Agatha decides that she refuses to play along. She’ll stay on her side of town, and with no big anniversaries coming up they won’t run into one another at the cemetery either.</p><p>Rio will slink back to her door sooner or later and Agatha will get them back on track, no more of this extracurricular contact. She exhales through her nose, relaxing fractionally. This is a plan that can work.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fly open as she remembers the meeting with the lawyer and the lead plaintiffs in the lawsuit that Rio had told her about, her words playing back in her head. <em> It would help if we joined them. If we told his story. </em></p><p>Agatha grinds her teeth, flexing her jaw against the burn in her lungs. The tides of her grief– propelled by her anger and her fragility and her exhaustion from the never ending battle against the ache in her chest– finally close over her head. Agatha feels it settle into her, knows she will spend the rest of the evening and long into the night drowning.</p><p>She throws the car in drive and pulls out of the lot, the hum of the engine filling her ears as she hits the gas. Agatha’s hands shake the whole way home.</p>

<p>As infrequently as she can get away with, Agatha’s job mandates that she drag herself up to Boston and meet with her boss in person. Being the company’s Chief Marketing Officer has the much appreciated bonus of meaning she answers to nearly no one, but unfortunately the one person Agatha <em> does </em> answer to is an obnoxious, overly familiar old bat who is as much bite as she is bark.</p><p>She’s one of the few people in the world that Agatha truly enjoys. Gun to head, she would not admit as much.</p><p>Lilia Calderu’s office is on the twentieth floor of a sleek Boston highrise, with massive wooden shelves laden with books covering three of the walls and floor to ceiling windows commanding the fourth. A set of plush love seats angle towards one another around a coffee table on the right half of the room, and on the left Lilia sits in her desk chair like it’s a throne, berating some poor idiot on the other end of the phone in her hand.</p><p>Agatha merely leans in the doorway, watching the spectacle before her. Grey curls have fallen from Lilia’s bun and bob angrily with her head as she yells, her face turning red with the exertion. She gesticulates with a hand weighed down with chunky mismatched rings, and a similarly uncoordinated arrangement of necklaces pulls at her throat.</p><p>With an air of finality, Lilia hurls demands into the phone and ends the call without waiting for a response, setting it face down on her desk and releasing a sigh. When she turns to Agatha, the red of her cheeks is long forgotten and a small smirk plays at her lips.</p><p>“Agatha,” she greets, rising from her chair and rounding to lean on the desk. “Welcome to your February performance review. So nice of you to make it.”</p><p>They both are aware that it is the middle of April, but Lilia’s words hold no indication of disappointment or frustration. If anything, a two month delay is pretty proactive on Agatha’s part. Agatha pushes off from her spot in the doorway and walks fully into the office, her silky white blouse suddenly overwarm in the sun drenched space.</p><p>“Well, one of us has to take this job seriously, Calderu. It’s a burden I bear proudly.”</p><p>Lilia scoffs with a roll of her eyes. With a swift hand she reaches out and catches Agatha’s arm, tugging her into a tight, inescapable hug.</p><p>“You don’t visit enough,” Lilia chastises into her hair. Agatha lets her stiff limbs relax. She is not melting into the hug, thank you very much. She’s just putting up less of a struggle so that it ends sooner. There’s a difference.</p><p>Lilia releases her and they assume their usual position– Agatha draped across one of the love seats and Lilia looking regal on the other, each of them sipping from a can of wine and neither of them particularly bothered by the knowledge that it is not yet noon.</p><p>The thing about Lilia is that she had set up a table at a career fair at the college in the city almost twenty years ago mostly on a whim. As a woman with few resources looking to start her own ad agency, she’d had very little to lose.</p><p>Agatha, nearing the end of her undergraduate career with a degree in business that she had no true dreams of using, figured a career fair couldn’t hurt. Admittedly, after hearing Lilia’s pitch, Agatha had been a bit of a bitch and laughed at her. She had not expected for Lilia to be an even bigger bitch back, tearing straight into Agatha with no regard for the fact that she was a grown up woman and Agatha was a 22 year old co-ed. It was magnificent.</p><p><em> Divination </em> was the only place Agatha had ever worked, which meant a few things. First, it meant that she had a hefty amount of respect in all of the offices of the now international firm, so she was very rarely bothered. It also meant that Lilia gave her a lot of leeway, allowing her to make her own hours and project deadlines so long as the company didn’t suffer, which had been instrumental during some rather agonizing periods of her life. But most annoyingly, it meant that Lilia Calderu knew all of Agatha’s business.</p><p>You invite a woman to your wedding and make her your child’s godmother and suddenly she feels she has a right to know things about you. It’s fucking exhausting.</p><p>Like a well oiled machine, the two traipse through their usual topics. They go over the numbers, chat about potential new clients and the status of current ones, and shit talk their most hated subordinates. For her performance review, Lilia tells her to stop being such a cunt to the men that they hire and to start wearing something nicer than jeans to company meetings. Agatha staunchly refuses to do either, and Lilia simply tilts her head back and finishes her wine.</p><p>The conversation lulls and Agatha finds herself glancing out through the pristine glass and at the city skyline, listening for the noisy streets that she knows she’s too far up to hear.</p><p>“You’ve been distracted today. Off, somehow, but I can’t put my finger on it.” Lilia’s words aren’t a question but a statement of fact. Though they don’t lack warmth, either.</p><p>Despite being only fifteen years her senior, Lilia has always approached Agatha with something akin to a casual maternal poise that lacks the finesse of a sugar coating but always has her best interests at heart nonetheless. Agatha has never really known what to do with it.</p><p>She turns her head back, meeting the curious but not overbearing gaze that waits for her. Agatha weighs her options.</p><p>She hasn’t told Wanda about… any of it, really. They don’t talk about the time since Nicky’s death or Rio as a general entity or the lawsuit papers that have been sitting in the junk bin in her kitchen and eating away at her from the inside out.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t really <em> want </em> to tell anyone, but the deal with Lilia is that it always comes to light sooner or later. She had been the first person other than Rio to know about the pregnancy, calling Agatha in the middle of the night only days after they’d found out to ask if it was true. She said she just had <em> one of those feelings </em>.</p><p>Lilia had been the one to find Agatha six months after his funeral and two months after Rio had left, answering the door in her robe and sporting enough scratches and bruises to rival a bear attack victim. She’d asked no questions, only letting herself into the kitchen to make enough soup to feed a small army.</p><p>So she tells her, in broad strokes, about the lawsuit and the meeting she’s not sure she’ll go to. About how the nature of her dynamic with Rio seems to be changing, though in what way she still doesn’t know.</p><p>Ever astute, Lilia parses through the jungle of what Agatha tells her to get to the heart of what it is she’s not saying, which is that Agatha is, quite plainly, scared. Afraid to open up to strangers about Nicky when she can’t even open up to herself about him without drowning in the endless ocean of her grief. Afraid that even if she wanted to, she’s not sure her body would be physically capable.</p><p>Setting the issue of Rio aside, Lilia pulls the yellow cardigan she’s wearing in lieu of a blazer tighter across her chest and delivers her verdict.</p><p>“You can go to that meeting and not say a single word, Agatha. You’re not a part of their case and you don’t owe them anything. If it’s truly that awful, you can get up and walk out and never think about it again.” She shrugs, tilting her head to the side like a weight has been added to her mental scales.</p><p>“Or, maybe you go and it feels nice to be there, in some way, and you agree to sign your name on their papers. Maybe they win the case and there’s money that you can funnel into something you think would honor Nicholas, like research at a children’s hospital or a local youth sports program or a goddamn rabbit sanctuary.”</p><p>Her last suggestion comes as an annoyed huff. None of them had escaped his rabbit phase unscathed.</p><p>“The point is, Agatha, that the lawsuit will happen with or without you. Rio is entitled to join with or without you, though I can’t say that she would. I <em> can </em> say that if someone is going to speak on his behalf, you would want it to be you.”</p><p>Agatha finds that she wants to spit on the woman, or throw her wine at her head, or scream something along the lines of <em> fuck you, you insufferable old hag. </em>Because she knows as soon as she hears her say it that Lilia is right. About each and every part of the situation.</p><p>And because now she has even more information about Agatha. One of these days, she’s sure, Lilia’s going to stop treating her like a person and start looking at her with those big pitying eyes that everyone seems to reserve for wounded fawns and Agatha Harkness.</p><p>Today, however, is not that day.</p><p>“You know, you hardly talk this much about yourself. I’m not used to it. I think I’ve used up all of my empathy and manners for the next five years,” Lilia sighs, opening another can of wine.</p><p>Agatha snorts, pulled from her internal melodrama. “Thank God, it was fucking weird to see you be nice for that long. It’ll be a couple dozen years before I let us do that again.”</p><p>Lilia feigns relief, and they share a smile. Maybe Agatha will make it to their September meeting by October.</p><hr/><p>Agatha leaves after a few more hours of idle chat and letting the wine leave her system, finally pulling back into her driveway just as the warm evening sun is beginning to melt into the horizon.</p><p>Slamming the driver’s side door shut, she rounds the vehicle to grab her purse from the passenger seat. With her arm still outstretched towards the bag, a burst of sound draws her attention away and into the street.</p><p>One red and one blue burst of movement peel into view, twining around one another on the quiet neighborhood street in a tornado of sound. The noise changes, though, and draws nearer with a suddenness that startles her. When the blurs of color and sound reach the end of her driveway, she realizes they are neither of those things. They are boys. They are calling her name.</p><p>“Miss Agatha!” Tommy shouts, dropping his scooter on the pavement and running up.</p><p>“Miss Agatha!” Billy echoes, setting his scooter down more carefully before following his brother.</p><p>Agatha’s heart catches in her throat, tunnel vision putting everything else out of focus as she looks at their faces. At ten years old, the twins seem impossibly big, with gaps in their smiles where their adult teeth haven’t grown in yet and mops of hair that fall in their eyes and curl at their necks and long limbs that don’t quite know what to do with themselves yet.</p><p>The two of them now older than Nicky ever got to be. It so viciously, achingly painful. It is so incredibly wonderful.</p><p>They’re speaking one over the other, shooting off rapid fire questions about where she’s been today and how she’s doing and if she’s seen some new movie called Mind Craft. Before she can answer they’ve moved on, talking about school and sports and whatever else ten year old boys fill their time with.</p><p>She stops listening to their words and focuses instead on their voices, still childlike but less the high pitch squeak of when she’d seen them last. They’ve never looked alike, but now she can see that they both resemble Wanda, in their own way. She wonders if either of them look like Pietro.</p><p>One hand lands on each set of small shoulders and the noise stops, their two small faces turning to look sheepishly at their mother.</p><p>“Boys,” Wanda chastizes, though she seems more exasperated than upset. “We told you not to ride too far out ahead of us. When you speed up like that it’s easier for you to get hurt.”</p><p>“Yes, mom,” they chorus back dutifully.</p><p>“And Ms. Agatha clearly just got home from work. She doesn’t need two little fireworks popping around her feet and talking her ears off.” This she delivers more playfully, and her words pull a giggle from Billy.</p><p>“Sorry, Ms. Agatha,” they turn and chorus to her. Their newfound docility gives her whiplash, but she offers them a sweet smile reserved for, well, no one anymore.</p><p>“That’s alright boys, I know you were just excited.”</p><p>Vision calls to the twins from the end of the driveway and they tear back to him, throwing Agatha a wave over their shoulders before returning to their scooters once more.</p><p>“Sorry about that,” Wanda winces, seemingly ready for Agatha to lash out. A part of her wants to, but she leans instead into the lingering softness.</p><p>“It’s really fine. They’re– they’ve grown so much. You’re doing a really great job with them, Wanda.” Agatha nearly vomits at the sincerity in her words. This is why she pushes off her meetings with Lilia– they make her mushy. She’ll get around to their September meeting by next January.</p><p>Wanda softens, turning her gaze back to the street for a moment, where the boys are trying to explain the rules of a clearly made up game to a confused Vision.</p><p>Agatha lets Wanda chatter on about things like the weather and work and some crazy PTA moms raising hell about the height of the slide on the school playground, allowing this last bit of human interaction before another quiet night at home.</p><p>“The flowers at Nicky’s grave were very beautiful this year. Something about the colors just reminded me a lot of him,” Wanda says, pulling Agatha’s focus abruptly back to her ramblings.</p><p>“What?” Agatha spits, torn between confusion and anger. Why would Wanda know? Why would Wanda bring it up? Wanda looks to her more fully, her eyes widening.</p><p>“Oh! I mean, the flowers are always really lovely, don’t get me wrong. These ones just–”</p><p>“Your opinion on the flowers does not matter to me at all. How do you know what they looked like?” She demands.</p><p>Wanda seems to calm down at this, like she was more worried about offending Agatha’s flower choices. Agatha hasn’t made a single flower choice since she was twenty years old and brought Rio a pitiful, wilting bouquet from the local grocery store and Rio had decreed that she would handle all things flora for the rest of their lives.</p><p>“I saw them when we went to visit. Vis and I take the boys usually in the days after his birthday so they can spend some time with him. They like to tell him their favorite moments from the past year.” And then, almost as an afterthought she adds, “we don’t go on the day of because I figured you guys would want that for yourselves.”</p><p>It’s the first time Wanda has mentioned either Nicky or Rio directly– or as close to directly as one can get. Agatha doesn’t know what to do with the feeling, doesn’t know how to handle two different people speaking about her son in one day when usually he lives entirely in her head.</p><p>As if remembering what she’d told the kids about Agatha having just gotten back from work, Wanda takes a step back.</p><p>“Well, I have to wrangle this group and get everyone ready for bed soon. It was good to see you, Agatha. I haven’t forgotten about our walk,” she jokes with a wink. Agatha bids her a goodbye and watches the four of them head down the street towards their house before going into her own home.</p><p>She sets her bag down by the door, toeing off her flats and padding into the living room where she pulls a framed photo down from the shelf by the TV and runs her fingers over the glass. In the print, Nicky and the twins and a handful of other neighborhood kids stand huddled together, dirty and grinning from a summer day spent running outside.</p><p>Sometimes, he becomes something of an imaginary friend in her mind, encased in the thick, impenetrable shell of her grief and devotion. But other times, like today, Agatha remembers that he was a boy. A kid with a thousand friends everywhere he went and a laugh so contagious it could get him out of any trouble. A standout in the elementary school choir with a voice like a songbird and the runner up in the second grade spelling bee.</p><p>On days like this, Agatha can feel the ache grow less persistent, soothed by the knowledge that other people hold him in their hearts, too, even if it’s difficult to think of him as anyone’s but hers. Theirs.</p><p>In a small, quiet part of herself, Agatha lets herself feel relieved that little pieces of him are scattered all over this town and as far away as Boston– relieved that she isn’t Atlas carrying the weight of his memory on her shoulders alone. Pushes away the nagging thought that she has never been Atlas, that there have always been four hands holding up this sky, not just her own two.</p><p>The meeting is a week away. As much as Agatha wishes it wasn’t true, she knows she’ll be there.</p>

<p>One week comes and goes, and Agatha spends all seven days stewing. She remembers exactly why it is that she’s been angry for so long, why she doesn’t want to join the stupid lawsuit.</p><p>But she’d told herself that she would at least hear them out, and Lilia had taken it upon herself to cancel all of Agatha’s meetings for the day without consulting her, so she puts her car in park and stares at the nondescript building that her GPS has brought her to. Agatha doesn’t normally come to this part of town, and the lack of familiarity only adds to her growing sense of unease.</p><p>She steps out of the car and locks it, smoothing down the skirt of the black dress that she’d begrudgingly borrowed from Wanda since all of her nice shit hangs weird and loose on her now.</p><p>(She’d discovered as much over the weekend. When had she last worn something that wasn’t jeans or leggings? Pathetic.)</p><p>The dress has a straight neck that cuts across her collarbones and long sleeves that hug her arms down to her wrists, the skirt full enough to not be indecent but still stopping a full three inches above Agatha’s knees. Her feet ache already in her deep plum colored pumps and the matching blazer she’d decided to drape over her shoulders feels like a parka beneath the weight of the April sun.</p><p>Agatha tosses her hair back over her shoulders, having found the patience to brush it all out but not to style it. The ends curl against the small of her back– she needs a haircut, probably, but that used to be Rio’s job. Another thought added to the long list of things that are pissing her off today.</p><p>Agatha tilts her head up to look at the building before her- a modern, chrome pillar with windows that have been tinted to keep prying eyes from knowing what goes on inside. As if anything in there is important enough to warrant such precautions.</p><p>Absently, she twirls the ring on her middle finger with her thumb. It’s a simple gold band with three small overlapping hearts ingrained in the center, one Nicky had gotten her for Mothers Day, which of course means Rio had taken him to the store to pick something out and then purchased it for him. It’s a small talisman, nothing that anyone else would take notice of. Agatha hopes it will make her brave.</p><p>Belatedly, Agatha realizes she’s nervous. She had never given Rio an answer one way or the other, not deeming the situation serious enough to unblock her number, but now she has the sudden burning fear that maybe Rio won’t be here after all and she’ll have to do this by herself. Sweating from the anxiety, Agatha tears the blazer from her shoulders and tosses it carelessly back into the car before slamming the door once more.</p><p>She thinks she might throw up her coffee in the decorative, half-dead bushes lining the parking lot at the thought of facing this alone, but then she sees her.</p><p>Leaning against the building just to the side of the front doors, face drawn in concentration beneath her sunglasses as she talks into her phone, her free arm crossed over her chest while her hand gesticulates in time with her words.</p><p>Rio’s hair is pulled back in a clip again, her arms left bare by the sleeveless cream mock turtleneck that she wears tucked into dark blue slacks that narrow at her ankles. She taps one loafer-clad foot against the concrete, clearly displeased with whatever conversation she’s having. The sunlight catches on the defined muscles of her arms, golden bronze and mouthwatering.</p><p>Agatha knows the moment she sees her because she lifts the sunglasses from her face, meeting Agatha’s eyes with neither a smile nor a frown and quickly wrapping up her conversation. <em> She was waiting for me</em>, Agatha realizes with a start. Unsure what to do with that, she simply crosses the lot to meet her.</p><p>“You came,” Rio says, her tone intentionally neutral.</p><p>“I did,” Agatha responds airily, unwilling to give her anything deeper.</p><p>Rio seems to accept it for what it is and holds the door open for Agatha to walk through, a cool wave of air conditioning hitting them both. Agatha mindlessly follows her past the receptionist and down to the hall to an elevator, watching Rio extend a finger to press one of the buttons and the chrome doors sliding shut. Agatha has the faint feeling that she’s walking passively into her own slaughter, but when the doors slide open once more she follows Rio down another hall and into a conference room.</p><p>When Rio pushes the doors open, Agatha steps through and does a sweep of the room. A tacky faux-wood paneling covers the walls to her right and left, each sporting a dated flat screen TV that must be used for video calls or presentations or other boring shit. Agatha looks past the long table that takes up the bulk of the space and instead peers out the line of windows across the far wall. Since they’re only three or four stories up, she can see everyone walking around outside like they’re little dolls, or maybe ants.</p><p>She focuses on the ant-dolls and not the sweaty man in a rumpled suit who immediately rises to greet them, shaking Rio’s hand firmly and then turning to do the same for her. When Agatha simply stares at him, he drops his hand back to his side with an awkward laugh and turns back to Rio.</p><p>“Rio, it’s so nice to put a face with the name from our emails,” he croons, earning a polite response from her. He shifts his focus back to Agatha now that his confidence has been boosted by witnessing Rio’s easy grace.</p><p>“And Mrs. Vidal–”</p><p>“Harkness.” Agatha cuts him off, already wondering how she's going to tolerate him for the entire meeting.</p><p>Beside her, Rio’s wince is so incredibly slight that she’s sure nobody else catches it. What had she been expecting? Agatha is not going to turn into some kind, docile creature just because she conceded to attend this meeting. The creature that lurks beneath her skin and cries out for blood has not retreated in the slightest.</p><p>“Ah, well then, Ms. Harkness. My name is Stephen Strange, and I’m the lead attorney for the case against the Perlman Clinic. Please, have a seat and we'll get started.” The man settles back into his chair at the head of the table. Rio tries to pull Agatha’s rolling chair out but she snatches it away quickly, pushing herself in and tapping the nails of her left hand across the wood impatiently. Rio settles into the chair next to her suavely, seemingly unbothered by the rejection.</p><p>For the first time since walking in, Agatha looks at the two silent women sitting directly across from them, their backs to the windows. The woman perpendicular to Agatha sits tall– regal, almost– with dark skin so smooth that Agatha almost finds herself feeling insecure about her own appearance. She knows her age is starting to show on her face and in the silver strands she’s begun to see in her hair brush, but this woman makes her feel like a crone.</p><p>She shakes herself out of it. <em> What the fuck is happening? I’m not even 40. And this is not the time. </em></p><p>Long golden earrings dangle from the woman’s ears and her pale pink dress makes her glow. She’s icy, formidable even, and the only show that she’s a living creature and not a statue is the hand resting on the thigh next to her, rubbing an absent pattern with her thumb.</p><p>The other woman seems smaller, more haggard. She has the same tired eyes that Agatha recognizes from the mirror, her dark shaggy hair sticking out at odd angles from running her fingers through it over and over again– Agatha presumes– with the ends dyed a fiery red. A leather jacket rests draped over the chair behind her, her button up and slacks the same black hue.</p><p>She keeps checking the time on the thick watch the rests on her wrist, almost rhythmically. It grates at Agatha– maybe the unplaced familiarity of it, maybe the sense that the woman feels she has better things to be doing.</p><p>“These are our lead plaintiffs, Jennifer Kale and Alice Wu-Gulliver,” Mr. Strange provides. The first woman– Jennifer– tilts her head toward them in acknowledgement but Alice doesn’t look up, just keeps her eyes trained on the hands of her watch. Rio offers a polite greeting on behalf of them both before finally diving in. She may be handling it better, but Agatha can tell she’s just as over the small talk and false pleasantries as she is.</p><p>“If you think the clinic is truly at fault, why are you proceeding with a civil and not a criminal suit?” She asks, directing her question to Strange. He seems to have been expecting this.</p><p>“A criminal suit requires that we prove to a jury that the Perlman Clinic is guilty of doctoring the test results beyond a reasonable doubt, whereas a civil trial only needs a preponderance of evidence to find the defendant liable for damages. So instead of having to convince them that the clinic <em> definitely </em>neglected their duty, we only have to convince them that it’s most likely true,” he pauses, donning a small smirk as though he can’t hide his pride at the plan. “This way, we’re dramatically more likely to win and the clinic still faces repercussions.”</p><p>Agatha, sick of talking about the whole situation like it’s a game of Monopoly and harboring an increasing desire to hit this man, snaps.</p><p>“If it’s too hard to prove in criminal court and it’s a slam dunk in civil court, why the hell are we here? It doesn’t seem like one more sob story for the collection is suddenly going to make you good enough at your job to get a guilty verdict. I think you're wasting my time.”</p><p>She doesn’t move her eyes from where they've fallen back to the windows as she speaks, not deeming the lawyer worthy of her full attention. From across the table, Jen remains silent but narrows her eyes at Agatha. The lawyer flicks his gaze nervously between her and Rio, like he thinks Rio somehow can keep her on a leash. For her part, Rio is staring at the ceiling like something there might be merciful enough to grant her patience. Mr. Strange clears his throat, tugging at the collar of his shirt with a finger.</p><p>“Ms. Vidal said that your family utilized a donor from the Perlman Fertility Clinic to conceive and had– um– difficulties stemming from, potentially, the clinic’s withholding of genetic information regarding your donor. We’ve gathered similar testimonials from several other families, yes, but the more fodder we have the easier it’ll be to nail the clinic on their negligence,” he explains, as if Agatha hasn’t already read the papers Rio left at her house ten times over. As if he’s saying anything she doesn’t already know.</p><p>His repeated referral to them as a family is starting to wear her raw, a tension headache beginning to form at her temples. When Strange is done speaking, Agatha finally turns her head and looks him fully in the eye. He cringes away from the intensity in her face. Pitiful man.</p><p>“My son is dead,” she says bluntly. “Would that be the difficulty you’re referring to?”</p><p>She catches Rio’s pinched expression from the corner of her eye and takes a small delight in the quiet choking sound that the attorney makes, but she feels new eyes on her now. She shifts her attention.</p><p>Alice is looking up from her watch and directly into Agatha’s face, no longer fidgeting, no longer somewhere far away but fully in the room at last. Before the lawyer can stutter out some half-assed correction or Rio can apologize on Agatha's behalf, Alice speaks.</p><p>“Our daughter is five,” she says. Her voice is low but serious, like she needs to be sure that Agatha is listening. She is.</p><p>“She has cystic fibrosis. They didn’t catch it when they tested her as an infant– which apparently happens almost exclusively to non-white children, by the way– so she’s been hurting all this time and nobody could tell us why. And now that they can, they keep telling us how <em> unfortunate </em> it is that she went undiagnosed for so long because of all of the long term setbacks it creates.” Her voice is sharpening now, no louder than before but rising in anger all the same.</p><p>“My little girl has to sleep with a mask. Every night she begs us not to make her wear it, not to make her take the medicine anymore. I can’t tell a toddler that it’s the only way to delay the lung transplant that the doctors are sure she’ll need soon. I can't tell her she might asphyxiate in her sleep without it.” Alice leans forward in her chair and Agatha instinctively mimics the motion, the two of them trapped in the spell together. In her periphery, Agatha can see the grip that Jen has on Alice’s thigh tightening.</p><p>“I got tested before the pregnancy. I don’t have the fucking gene. We did <em> everything right </em> and this is still happening because that clinic is fucking evil and doesn’t give a shit about any of us so long as they get their money,” Alice’s eyes flash, and Agatha swears she sees fire behind her pupils. “I want them to bleed for it.”</p><p>The room falls entirely silent, like Alice’s words have sucked all of the air out. Agatha releases a breath she didn’t know she’d been holding, her anger ebbing slightly and a different tension taking its place. Alice’s eyes flicker briefly back down to her watch, and Agatha feels a sudden clarity at the motion. Alice is running out of time. Because maybe her child is dying, and she knows it, and each passing minute is being pried violently from her grip.</p><p>Because Alice has probably watched dozens of other parents parade in and out of this room and talk about their dead children before going home to her own dying child, listening to her baby cry and having no way to fix it or slow down the clock.</p><p>The muscle of Jen’s jaw twitches but she remains otherwise as still as ever, watching Agatha like she’s a predator that could sink her teeth into Alice at any moment. But it’s Rio that breaks the silence with her quiet, measured words.</p><p>“We can’t prove definitively that what happened to Nicky was a result of the donor’s DNA.” The words shatter the spell and Agatha slumps back into her chair, returning her attention to the windows. A woman in an obnoxious pink sweatsuit walks her fat dog down the sidewalk, and Agatha tracks her steps.</p><p>“The doctors knew enough to say that his death was caused by a genetic abnormality but not enough to pin down which of us it could have come from,” she continues. “Agatha carried but we used my egg, and I didn’t have any family so my medical history was spotty at best.”</p><p>Agatha sees the dog walker lift her phone to her ear, talking with her mouth all of the way open. She tries to imagine what she could possibly be talking so animatedly about, tries to leave her body and not think about how she killed their son. Or about how Rio thinks <em> she </em> killed their son. Neither are thoughts that she can face head on and survive.</p><p>When he speaks, Mr. Strange’s voice is gentler than it had been before, like Rio is the true grieving mother and Agatha is just the wild beast that she brought along with her.</p><p>“With the more concrete cases that we have, like Alice and Jen’s, your testimony would be more like a support beam around the main structure of our argument. Whether you can trace the abnormality back to the clinic or not doesn’t entirely matter, only that your family’s story can help cast more doubt.”</p><p>Agatha still doesn’t want to do this, doesn’t know if she can share their son with the world. Can’t bear the thought of him just being a statistic somehow, some afterthought tacked on to a case that will go on with or without him. </p><p>The lawyer seems to watch her face, reading her hesitation and choosing the worst possible way to address it.</p><p>“We’re also projecting that should we win, each family can expect several thousand dollars from the settlement, provided that–”</p><p>Rio calmly but firmly cuts him off with “we don’t give a shit about the money, Stephen,” at the same time that Agatha yells “<em>stop calling us a family!</em>”</p><p>The room falls silent again, like they’ve all just noticed that they’re standing directly atop a landmine. Jen’s eyes slide from Agatha to Rio and back, finally assessing part of the situation that she hadn’t deemed important enough to notice before.</p><p>Wisely, Stephen clicks his jaws shut and doesn’t attempt to apologize. Rio turns her whole head to stare at Agatha, who simply meets her eyes with a studiously blank face. She hopes that Rio is using her stupid mind reading powers now and that she can hear her snarling <em> I’m sure that hurt you and I absolutely do not give a fuck. You dragged me here, but that does not mean we are on the same team. Never again. </em></p><p>After a moment, Rio breaks their stare to look over to Alice and Jen and then back to Strange, pulling a deep breath in through her nose and lifting the corners of her lips in a forced but polite smile.</p><p>“We’re in. Just let me know what information you need from us and I’ll provide it. You already have my email, Stephen,” Rio says, standing and pulling two business cards from her back pocket before handing one to the lawyer and one to Alice and Jen.</p><p>Agatha watches on in shock, a deafening ringing filling her ears and making it almost impossible to think. It can’t be possible that Rio just answered for the both of them like that. That she didn’t consider how Agatha might feel at all.</p><p>As she tries to wrap her head around it, she notices everyone else has stood from their seats as well, shaking hands and exchanging contact information. Agatha stays in her chair, her legs ignoring her demand to run far away and never come back. She finds Alice watching her, something a little too knowing in her gaze. She’s calm again, but Agatha knows what she saw– knows that fire is still burning behind her eyes. Knows the same fire has long since turned everything inside of herself to ash.</p><p>Alice looks away when Jen places a hand to the small of her back and the two turn to consult with Strange, probably about what their agreement means for the case as a whole. Agatha pushes back from her chair and turns to leave without a word, but Rio is already at her back, holding the door open. Agatha doesn’t look at her as she walks through.</p><p>She lets Rio start to lead them back toward the elevator, but once Agatha’s sure they’re out of earshot she sinks her claws into the meat of Rio’s forearm, ignoring the pained hiss she releases and dragging them through maze-like halls until she finds a bathroom.</p><p>Rio’s shock lasts long enough to let Agatha shove her through the door and into the cramped space, keeping her still while Agatha snicks the lock shut. It’s a a small single-occupancy bathroom that fits the ambiance of the overly pristine building, with white walls and a small vanity and a fake plant with waxy plastic leaves in the corner.</p><p>“How dare you agree to join them without even asking me first? You think that just because we were polite on his birthday you have any right to speak for me?” Agatha spits, jabbing a finger out. Rio huffs an incredulous laugh, pacing in the cramped room like she’ll explode if she stands still.</p><p>“I actually can’t believe I have to say this again, but this isn’t about <em> you</em>, Agatha. And while we’re at it, I’m not surprised that you don’t have empathy for me. I stopped expecting that a long time ago. But it is <em> insane </em> that you don’t have any for people like Jen and Alice. Even I didn’t think you could be that heartless.”</p><p>It’s Agatha’s turn to scoff, absorbing the sharp sting of Rio’s words and letting it feed the rising flames of rage inside of her.</p><p>“You can drop the ‘woe is me’ act. We both know that you don’t need my empathy. You haven’t for years.”</p><p>Rio moves in a flash, shoving Agatha back with both hands. Agatha winces when her back connects with the marble of the vanity, but the pain is dulled by the surprise of seeing this side of Rio in public. She’s close enough now that Agatha can smell the spearmint of her favorite gum on her breath.</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em> you, you don’t get to decide what I need. You think you can pretend that you know a damn thing about me and then sit in there and tell those people we’re not a family. Maybe you never knew me at all.” Rio is seething, each word hissed out like she can poison Agatha with her voice alone.</p><p>Agatha would almost be amused, could maybe even laugh if what she said didn’t piss her off so bad.</p><p>“Jesus, Rio. Don’t act like I’m the bad guy here. You’re actually losing it if that’s what you’re hung up on.”</p><p>She’s halfway through an eye roll when Rio crowds her against the sink, a hand framing her throat and pressing in. The cool metal of Rio’s rings stings against the heated skin, the pressure not quite cutting Agatha’s airflow off entirely but definitely restricting it. Her exhale could be mistaken for a quiet moan, if someone were listening for that sort of thing.</p><p>Rio’s eyes are wild– enraged, unleashed. Her voice is a growl.</p><p>“You can lie to yourself all you want but you can’t fucking lie to me, Agatha. I’m your family and you’re mine, until all three of us are in the ground together.” She increases the pressure at Agatha’s throat. “Don’t you fucking forget that.”</p><p>Agatha opens her mouth, ready to launch something vile enough to destabilize her, but Rio is on her before she can. Her tongue pushes past Agatha’s lips and teeth and swallows both the fire in her throat and the gasp that the motion draws, drinking them down and punctuating the theft with a dig of her teeth into Agatha’s bottom lip.</p><p>The counter is painful against the small of her back, but Rio draws somehow closer still as she kisses her, pressing further into Agatha until it feels like there’s no air left for her lungs, just Rio’s mouth on hers and Rio’s hand at her throat and Rio’s perfume making her eyes water.</p><p>Desperate to retaliate, Agatha makes an attempt at digging her nails into Rio’s exposed biceps. Rio pulls away and intercepts her quickly, grabbing both hands and spinning her around to pin them on the cold marble of the vanity. She presses herself to Agatha’s back, bending her over and creating a cage with her body. Her words lose none of their violent edge despite being delivered as a purr into Agatha’s ear.</p><p>“We’re not doing things your way today, <em>Harkness</em>. I am going to go back to work after this without a single fucking scratch because you are going to show me some respect for once in your life.”</p><p>Internally, Agatha turns molten at the words, at Rio’s tone. She’s pretty sure she’s soaked through her panties, might even be dripping. Externally, Agatha laughs a mean little laugh with the sole purpose of knocking Rio down a peg.</p><p>“You think you’re hot shit today, huh?” Her words come out with the full extent of their intended snark, and Agatha feels her mind clear fractionally with the leverage.</p><p>But Rio only smirks at her, meeting Agatha’s eyes in the mirror before gripping her hip with one hand to hold her in place and pressing the fingers of her other hand featherlight to the back of Agatha’s opposite knee, lifting her dress as she goes. Agatha’s stance is widened with the position Rio holds her in and she’s bent over further than she would be without her heels. She sucks in a breath through her teeth, not daring to look away from Rio’s eyes.</p><p>Those fingers slide steadily upwards, slow and intentional. Agatha might be shaking, but that's not important. And Rio can surely feel the heat radiating off of Agatha’s cunt before she even hits mid-thigh, but that's not important either.</p><p>Her touch somehow, maddeningly, slows down the higher she rises, the smirk on her face growing wider and crueler. Agatha watches their reflection as Rio leans in closer to her ear, never once breaking their stare.</p><p>“I bet you’ve been desperate for me for months, probably fucking yourself to the thought of my touch like a pathetic whore. So stupid for it that you pulled me into the bathroom of a law firm.”</p><p>And Agatha wants to push back– wants to tell Rio that she’s a sick freak drunk on a power trip– but instead her eyelids flutter shut and her cheeks burn. When Agatha forces her eyes back open and finds her gaze again, it’s Rio's turn to laugh. The sound registers closer to a snarl, but there’s no mistaking it with the way her face is alight with a violent glee. Agatha feels her arousal begin to spill down her thighs.</p><p>“That’s exactly what I thought,” Rio sighs, as though they’re both working from the same script and Agatha keeps forgetting her lines. She shifts her hand slightly and suddenly a single finger rests against the crease of Agatha’s thigh, the tip of a nail tracing the damp skin. Agatha nearly bites through her tongue trying not to react.</p><p>“Here’s what’s going to happen. I’m going to fuck you in this bathroom like the filthy slut that you are, and you’re going to stay nice and quiet so that the poor people in this office don’t find you in here with my fingers stuffed in your dripping cunt. Do you understand?”</p><p>Agatha gives her pride and her horniness exactly three quarters of a second to make their arguments before she nods, catching her own reflection in the mirror and finding that she’s already panting and flushed, looking like she’s about to cum untouched. She feels less bad about not making a stand for her pride.</p><p>When Rio still doesn’t move, Agatha looks back up at her and finds that she’s still waiting. After a tense beat, Agatha narrows her eyes, grinding out a <em> yes ma'am </em> through clenched teeth. The smile that Rio gives her in response settles low in her gut, lust and fear coiling tightly around one another. </p><p>Without further teasing, Rio pulls the gusset of her panties to the side and runs two fingers from Agatha’s entrance to her clit, a pleased little hum escaping from the back of her throat as she passes through slick folds with no resistance. The touch is, embarrassingly, enough to get Rio’s fingers sufficiently wet and she presses them both in to the hilt with a quickness that nearly has Agatha’s legs buckling.</p><p>She fights back against the moans and whimpers that threaten to spill from her lips, but when Rio adds a third finger without warning Agatha can’t stop the whine that slips out of her. Almost immediately Rio’s free hand leaves Agatha’s hip and settles beneath her chin, her thumb holding Agatha’s jaw steady while she pushes her middle and ring finger past her lips.</p><p>Agatha watches the scene unfold through the mirror, right down to the moment Rio presses down on the back of her tongue and makes her gag. Her silver rings clink against Agatha’s teeth, turning warm in her mouth.</p><p>Still fucking into her at a brutal pace that presses Agatha’s quickly bruising hip bones into the counter with each thrust, Rio leans back in towards her ear to murmur filthy praise and abuse alike in a voice so low that Agatha can barely hear it over the pounding drum of her own pulse.</p><p>Sweat beads at Rio’s brow from the exertion, though not enough to disturb her makeup or pull even a single strand from her neat updo. In contrast Agatha’s thighs are shaking and her chest heaving. Spit dribbles out of her lips and down Rio’s fingers as she pumps them in and out of her mouth, falling very conveniently into the bowl of the sink below. The sounds of their heavy breaths fill the room, overshadowed only by the lewd, wet sounds of Rio fucking her on both ends.</p><p>Agatha prides herself on remaining exceptionally quiet, given that without the makeshift gag she’s certain she’d be screaming by now. She’s jostled out of the thought when a particularly harsh thrust into her cunt rocks her forward harder than expected and sends the fingers in her mouth further down her throat. Agatha gags harshly on the digits and feels tears slip down her cheeks, but Rio’s answering groan in her ear has her eyes rolling back into her head.</p><p>With a renewed vigor, Agatha begins rolling her hips back to meet each of Rio’s thrusts, pushing those fingers further into her cunt and nearly weeping in relief when the change has each inward press brushing the spot inside of her that makes her brainless.</p><p>Rio’s babbling into her ear now, watching with rapt attention as her fingers piston in and out of Agatha. “I wish I had my strap so I could make sure you won’t be able to walk tomorrow. Would make you get on all fours right here and pound this pussy 'til you beg me to stop,” she breathes, not looking up until her words make Agatha clench so hard that she almost forces Rio’s fingers out of her.</p><p>Rio huffs a harsh laugh. “You’re so fucking easy. Once a cockslut always a cockslut, isn't that right?”</p><p>Far beyond the land of rational thought, all Agatha can do is nod around the fingers in her mouth, sucking them in greedily.</p><p>“Go on, pretty girl, touch yourself for me. Make a show of it,” Rio taunts, amusement clear in her tone. Agatha complies all the same, resting her weight on one shaky arm and moving her left hand beneath the bunched skirt of her dress. When her fingers slide beneath the waistband of her underwear and find her swollen clit, Agatha nearly collapses, choking again on Rio’s fingers when her head falls forward with the motion. She catches herself at the last second, gripping the counter’s edge for dear life.</p><p>Agatha’s hair shields her face as she pants, starting a steady rhythm at her clit that she knows will have her seeing stars soon enough. She tries to remember to hold onto the fight of it all– to give as good as she gets– but all she can focus on is being so full that she can’t breathe, so full that she can’t think. Just how she likes it.</p><p>But Rio’s fingers in her cunt and at her lips stop moving at once. Agatha looks up, frantically shaking the hair from her face and finding Rio in the mirror with wide, panicked eyes. The moment their eyes connect, Rio thrusts forcefully back in, curling her fingers precisely into Agatha’s g-spot with a clear message. <em> Look at me. </em></p><p>Agatha complies, all of her senses completely overtaken by Rio. She picks up speed against her clit, rubbing in tight circles, and in less than a minute she feels the wave of pleasure beginning to crest. Agatha tries to warn Rio with her eyes, tries to pull off of her fingers to speak, but Rio presses down on her tongue, effectively hooking her like a fish, and picks up the pace. Agatha knows she'll be bruised from the way her knuckles slam repeatedly into tender flesh.</p><p>“Remember, Aggie. Not a sound,” Rio warns quietly, her breath hot against the shell of Agatha’s ear.</p><p>It’s all the encouragement she needs, and Agatha comes with a silent scream. For a second, she wonders if she actually might black out, the pleasure so overwhelming that it turns blinding. Rio pulls her fingers from Agatha’s mouth and holds her waist with the spit-soaked digits while she comes down, making sure Agatha doesn’t collapse onto the tile floor.</p><p>When her breathing has slowed back down to something close to normal, Rio slowly pulls the fingers of her other hand out of Agatha’s cunt, and the sense of loss is instant and staggering. Agatha can only watch through hooded eyes as Rio’s reflection sucks those dripping fingers clean, turning to pull a paper towel from the dispenser and wiping them off when the only dampness left is her own spit. The sight makes Agatha clench again.</p><p>“I gave Stephen your email too, so keep an eye on your inbox in case he needs anything.”</p><p>Agatha splutters as though ice water has been dumped over her head and injected into her veins, so thrown by Rio’s snap-second change from domineering to detached that she can’t form words. Rio seems to take no notice of her astonishment, only turning without saying goodbye and slipping back out through the door, leaving Agatha alone with the silent walls and the oppressive stench of sex.</p><p>With a rush of belated shame, Agatha cleans herself up, straightening out the neckline of her dress and gingerly dabbing at her face with a damp paper towel. When she stands up straight, she knows that her hips are bruised from the counter top and from Rio’s hands. Even worse, she knows it’s going to take all of her might to walk out of this building with a normal gait with the throbbing between her legs.</p><p>She readjusts her underwear from where they’ve been yanked to the side and the feeling of the cold, wet fabric against her feverish skin makes her want to scream. Instead, Agatha pulls herself together, running a hand through her hair and walking back to the elevator with her head held high. On the ride down, she notices the wet spot on her waist– a likeness of Rio’s fingers painted in her own spit. She cringes when she remembers this dress is borrowed.</p><p>When she gets back to the ground floor and out into the afternoon light of the parking lot, Rio is nowhere to be found.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>In the second week of May, Agatha breaks. She’s been diligently ignoring all of Stephen’s emails and throwing herself uncharacteristically into work to the point where she joins a virtual meeting early and catches two employees debating whether or not she’s having a psychotic break. She’s so distracted she forgets to have them fired for it.</p><p>Truthfully, she’d almost rather rake her eyes out with her nails, but Agatha employs her final line of defense against her brain’s incessant rehashing of what happened in the law office bathroom. She’s tried fruitlessly to rid herself of the memory– to forget the way that Rio had left without a word, without even looking back.</p><p>Though she should have expected as much. Rio doesn’t owe her anything.</p><p>But there is only so much ruminating she can do on one line of thought, and Agatha was desperate enough to do the unthinkable.</p><p>Three days ago, she had run into Wanda on the sidewalk while getting her mail and agreed to go on a walk together. She walked back inside afterward and barely resisted the urge to throw herself down the stairs.</p><p>Agatha sits in the passenger seat of Wanda’s silver mini van with her window rolled halfway down, listening to Wanda hum along to whatever pop song is on and letting the breeze caress her face. They’d decided on a trail less than an hour outside of town, a meandering little path through the woods by the coast.</p><p>Wanda parks in the small gravel lot at the trailhead, tucking the car keys into her crossbody bag and adjusting her ponytail. Agatha runs a hand down the front of her oversized t-shirt that depicts a cartoon tent framed by a stupid boner joke. She’d bought it at the thrift store when she was pregnant and in need of anything that would cover her stomach, though now it’s just an old comfort.</p><p>Wanda makes small talk about the frenzy of the boys’ exam prep at school and the coworkers that are pissing her off as they walk, watching their feet as they go to avoid a twisted ankle.</p><p>It’s not steep enough to be considered a hike by any means, but Agatha feels herself breaking a sweat and knows her thighs will be sore from the effort tomorrow. She’s been eating more often lately– if only to avoid borrowing any more of Wanda’s clothes– and hauling dirt around the yard now that all of the plants have come back to life, bringing some muscularity back to her frame. Agatha thought that with her newfound energy, the walk would be a breeze.</p><p>She was wrong. It’s a small mercy that Wanda doesn’t expect a response from Agatha as she talks, seemingly content to let her focus on working gulps of air into her heaving lungs.</p><p>When finally the path evens out and they find themselves on a wide, smooth stretch, Wanda lobs the conversation in her direction.</p><p>“So what have you been up to?”</p><p>It’s inconspicuous enough, really. Agatha could say something about her failed attempts at gardening or her projects at work, but whatever madness had compelled her to join Wanda on the trail in the first place seems to be taking over again.</p><p>“There’s this…legal matter with the fertility clinic we used. Some missing information and sick kids, stuff like that,” Agatha begins, trying to find the right words. It’s not that she doesn’t trust Wanda with the information so much as it is that it feels a bit like standing naked under a fluorescent light to talk about it. Graciously, Wanda keeps her eyes on the forest while Agatha talks, not adding the burden of eye contact to the moment.</p><p>“It’s just been a bit much, I guess. I don’t see why they think that just because other kids have problems they’re entitled to pry into my life and pick apart his memory,” Agatha huffs, crossing her arms over her chest and flicking her heavy braid back over her shoulder.</p><p>She finds she’s not entirely sure how she wants Wanda to respond. If she wants her to at all. It feels like strange new territory, putting herself in this vulnerable unknown.</p><p>“I always think about when the boys first started kindergarten. They were so scared of everything, and at recess they’d just sit in the grass by themselves, too shy to talk to anyone else. Some older kids took to taunting them, calling them ‘the conjoined twins’ and threatening to pull them apart. But then Nicky was there, standing between the boys and these kids that were surely twice his size. From what I’ve been told he gave them quite the dressing down, and they never bothered the boys again.”</p><p>It’s a nice story, Agatha concedes, but she truly has no idea how it’s connected to what she’d said about the lawsuit. Maybe Wanda hadn’t been listening? Maybe she doesn’t know how to handle Agatha showing vulnerability so she’s changing the subject?</p><p>But Wanda glances over at her, offering a small smile.</p><p>“Other people can try to pick apart Nicky’s memory all they want, but it’s never going to change who he was to the people that loved him. Billy and Tommy don’t remember him because of some legal thing with a fertility clinic. They remember him because in their eyes he’ll always be a larger-than-life hero that hung the moon.”</p><p><em>Oh.</em> Agatha swallows around the lump that forms in her throat, surprised at the feeling of her anxiety easing some with the words. Hearing again that other people remember him, think about him, say his name out loud. She thinks again about what Wanda had said about having to carry her grief alone, and about Atlas holding up the sky.</p><p>She thinks about how Rio already decided that Nicky will be part of the lawsuit– just another statistic for Stephen’s argument– and how maybe the best revenge she can get is ensuring that they can’t have him without acknowledging that he was a little boy. That he <em> lived</em>. </p><p>In lieu of thanks, Agatha offers a memory of her own.</p><p>“Do you remember the time we were at the pool and the twins hadn’t learned how to swim yet but didn’t want to use waterwings anymore? Nicky took turns hoisting them on his back around the shallow end so that they could play with all of the other kids. He pretended they were sea-knights and he was their seahorse.”</p><p>Surprise flashes on Wanda’s face but she covers it quickly. “Of course I do. They demanded Vision be their seahorse every time we went to the pool for the rest of the summer. And then they would scold him for not ‘doing it like Nicky.’ It was hysterical.”</p><p>Agatha expects the memory to leave her feeling raw, but instead all it brings is a warmth. She smiles along with Wanda, and the beast beneath her skin stays quiet for the first time in a while.</p><p>Nicky was seven that summer, and he’d had a growth spurt that had left him a whole head taller than the twins. Both of his front teeth had fallen out and were slow growing back in, and he’d taken to sticking his tongue out through the gap. Agatha joked that if he’d looked like Rio before he was surely the spitting image now, and Rio would fake-pout until one or both of them made a show of groveling for her forgiveness.</p><p>After a stretch of quiet, the pair reach a point where the path opens up to a small pebbled beach, the slate grey sea water lapping gently against the stones. It’s a small shoreline, only a few yards in either direction, as though it was deliberately carved out of the forest to give the land a reprieve from the trees.</p><p>Agatha squints in the direct sunlight after so long on the shaded path and lifts a hand to shield her eyes, looking out towards the water. The outline of a woman sits atop a large rock nearby, her back to Agatha. She wears jean shorts and a band tee with the sleeves hacked off that matches her hiking boots. One leg is drawn up to support her chin while the other dangles off the side of the boulder, swaying lightly back and forth. Agatha recognizes Alice by the fiery tips of her hair.</p><p>She follows Alice’s line of sight to see Jen, barefoot in the water with her yoga pants rolled up past her knees. She holds the hand of a little girl with coffee skin and two french braids that explode into curly pigtails. The girl grips Jen’s hand back in her tiny fist, flapping her other hand excitedly in the air while she squeals in the waves.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t realize she’s been staring until the ringtone of Wanda’s phone breaks the quiet. Wanda pulls the device free from her bag and glances down.</p><p>“Hey, it’s Vis. Do you mind if I take this real quick?” She asks, almost apologetically. Agatha rolls her eyes.</p><p>“Wanda, answer the man. He could’ve burnt down your house.” Wanda’s brows draw together like she’s considering Agatha’s words as a real possibility before she steps back towards the treeline and lifts the phone to her ear.</p><p>Agatha looks back to see Alice’s eyes already on her, having turned at the sound of her voice. She offers a small wave when she catches Agatha’s eye, and Agatha decides it would be more awkward to outright ignore her for the duration of Wanda’s phone call.</p><p>She walks over and stands a few feet away from the rock, her head level with Alice’s shoulder. To her delight Alice offers no small talk, and instead they both seem content to watch the scene before them.</p><p>If she didn’t already know that Alice and Jen’s daughter was five she would guess the girl couldn’t be more than three with how tiny her frame is. Her laughter rings in the air like a bell and her eyes are bright, but there’s something tired behind her movements, like invisible weights have been tied to her ankles and wrists.</p><p>“Her name is Lorna,” Alice says after a while. “After my mother. She died while I was pregnant.”</p><p>Agatha thinks to offer her condolences, but it feels like the wrong thing to do. If someone offered their condolences about her mother’s death she would spit on them, probably. But Alice named her daughter after Lorna, so Agatha’s doubtful that would be her response.</p><p>Agatha remains silent, watching how Lorna seems to get winded quickly, how now that she’s watching she can see that Jen is supporting the bulk of her weight as she splashes around in her little wetsuit.</p><p>“Researchers have made incredible progress towards closing in on a cure for cystic fibrosis in the past twenty years alone. There’s a lot for them to work with. She has time,” Agatha says. She can feel Alice’s eyes on her face but she keeps her gaze steadily ahead.</p><p>Alice seems torn between her surprise at Agatha’s knowledge and her annoyance at the blunt commentary on her deepest wound.</p><p>“How do you know that?” She asks. Agatha shrugs dismissively.</p><p>“I googled it after our meeting.”</p><p>Agatha does not share that she has spent several evenings curled up in her bed with her laptop on her knees, reading studies from the Mayo Clinic and falling down rabbit holes on Reddit forums full of parents of kids with CF and adults with CF. Alice looks back to Jen and Lorna.</p><p>“She can’t play for more than ten minutes without getting winded. She can barely run, and sometimes even getting too excited about a cartoon or a song makes her breathing go crazy. The doctors say it’ll be like this until she gets a lung transplant, but they keep reminding us it’s tricky to find donor lungs that are a match <em> and </em>small enough to fit her body.”</p><p>Alice’s jaw flexes like she’s tasting something bitter. She shakes her head slightly.</p><p>“We’re waiting for another kid to die, is what they’re really saying. For some other person’s baby’s heart to stop so that their lungs can go in my baby.”</p><p>Agatha gets it, then, why Alice is so certain that the clinic must pay. Because they’ve put her in the position to have to hope that somebody else’s child dies. Because as awful as it is, Alice is clinging to that hope.</p><p>So Alice is angry at the clinic, and angry at herself, and angry at the whole world, probably, when little Lorna’s giggles turn into a hacking cough and Jen immediately sweeps her out of the water and into her arms, a soothing hand on her back. </p><p>Pristine, regal Jen doesn’t seem the least bit bothered by her previously untouched outfit being drenched by the shaking body pressed to her chest, focused only on getting them back to the shore and whispering soft, soothing words into Lorna’s hair.</p><p>Wanda appears from the trees at the same moment, calling down to Agatha.</p><p>“Ready to keep walking?” She asks, directing a polite smile to Alice, who nods in greeting. Agatha snaps her eyes away from Jen and up to Wanda, giving her a nod.</p><p>“Yeah, I’ll be right there.” As Agatha makes to leave, Alice shifts to one side and pulls her phone from the pocket of her shorts.</p><p>“Hey, Jen told Rio, but there’s a support group for everyone in the suit plus the people that Stephen contacted but didn’t want to join. I don’t know if you’d ever want to go, but I want you to have the option.”</p><p>She opens a blank text thread and pastes the link to the group’s page in, handing the phone to Agatha to type in her number and hit send. Agatha complies and gives it back, offering Alice a short goodbye. Alice pockets the phone and pushes off the rock to join her family at the shore, and Agatha joins Wanda to continue on the path.</p><p>Wanda, for her part, doesn’t pry. She lets them walk quietly for a few minutes, listening to the squirrels rustling in the trees and the fading sound of the waves, before speaking again.</p><p>“They seem nice. Cute kid, too.” Her tone is light, not probing but still leaving the door open, should Agatha wish to walk through it. Agatha gives a noncommittal hum.</p><p>“I don’t really know them like that.” Wanda lets it drop, and they finish the walk without incident. </p><p>When the drive home is nearing its end, Wanda turns the radio down slightly and drums her fingers against the wheel, like she’s hyping herself up for something. Agatha watches her curiously from the corner of her eye, waiting to see where it goes.</p><p>“We’re hosting a party at the end of June to celebrate the end of the school year. At our house. I promise I don’t have any expectation for you to come and there will be no hurt feelings, but I wanted to invite you anyway. To let you know that you’re welcome,” she says, but she pushes it all out in one breath so it comes out as one long, incoherent word.</p><p>Agatha blinks, piecing together what Wanda’s trying to say. A party at the end of the school year, presumably with all of their neighbors and all of the kids that used to stomp through her house and run around her yard. She thinks of how odd it would be to show up alone after all of these years as a recluse– the questions she won’t be able to answer and the smiles she won’t fake for them.</p><p>But then again, when had she really ever? It’s not like she’s ever been a well-mannered housewife like the rest of them.</p><p>“We’ll see,” Agatha says, not willing to commit one way or the other. Even so, Wanda relaxes visibly, seeming pleased by this answer. She drops Agatha off at home with the promise to reach out soon, swearing that she has to come over for dinner one of these days.</p><p>“Don’t push it, Red,” Agatha deadpans, glaring at her before getting out of the van and walking inside.</p><p>Agatha carries herself through the motions of showering and eating and dragging her sore body into bed, shuffling down beneath the covers before grabbing her glasses from the nightstand. She pulls her laptop over from where it rests on the far side of the bed and pulls up the link from Alice, saving her number before clicking on the link in their chat.</p><p>The support group page is more active than Agatha was expecting, with a message board and section for photos and a drop down menu for subgroups that she’s not entirely sure how to navigate. She skims briefly through the recent messages before clicking on the icon to see all of the names, morbidly curious to see if there’s anyone she knows.</p><p>Besides Alice and Jen, Agatha’s shocked to find around 20 people are already in the group, herself included. That’s a minimum of ten households that might have been impacted by the clinic withholding information. The thought makes Agatha sick, her dinner churning uneasily in her stomach.</p><p>She sees Rio’s name on the list, with a blank profile picture and a little ‘0’ next to it to indicate that she hasn’t posted any messages to the page. She keeps scrolling, zooming in on the little images to see that some of the people look to be about her age, though some are much younger and some definitely older, too.</p><p>Agatha wonders how many of them have dead kids, how many of the still living ones will actually make it to adulthood. She thinks of five year old Lorna being betrayed by her own body, of the sleep mask Alice had talked about. She thinks of the other faceless, nameless kid that has to die for Lorna to get better.</p><p>All of it adds to her growing nausea and she abruptly reaches out and slaps the computer shut, but not before seeing that the group’s next meeting is this coming Thursday.</p><p>Agatha slips her glasses back off and pushes her laptop back over to the empty half of the bed, sliding out from beneath the blankets and padding down the hall in the dark. She carefully twists the knob of the door at the top of the stairs and flicks on the light, hovering like a ghost in the doorway.</p><p>Of course it’s all the same, disturbed only when Agatha comes in to dust or vacuum or change the sheets on the bed. The overstuffed bookshelf in the corner might as well be groaning beneath the weight of his comic books and lego creations, the dog-eared copy of <em> The Lightning Thief </em> waiting patiently on his dinosaur nightstand for his next birthday reading.</p><p>The pale blue walls are plastered with paintings and drawings and posters, his plaque of recognition from choir leaning on the windowsill. Señor Scratchy the rabbit lays face up on the bed, his black plastic eyes staring up at the glow in the dark stars that Rio had painstakingly formed into constellations across the ceiling. The large, almost uninterpretable watercolor portrait he’d made of the three of them in his kindergarten art class is framed on the wall above his bed.</p><p>It feels like looking at a piece of him, like maybe he’s just down the hall brushing his teeth and will slip back past her and into the room at any moment.</p><p>After he died, Agatha had spent every night curled on his rug beneath the yellow-green glow of the stars, not willing to disturb the bed but needing to be close by. Like maybe he would wake up in the cemetery and find his way home and slip back into his bed. He would need his mother close by to comfort him then, to fight off the lingering fear of that small, dark place she’d left him in.</p><p>When Rio had shuffled in that first night with bloodshot eyes and tried to coax her into coming back to bed, Agatha had screamed at her until her throat was raw. Accused her of wanting to forget about him, of being selfish. Rio had walked out without a word, a look of pained shock frozen on her face.</p><p>Agatha pretended not to hear her sobbing in the master bedroom.</p><p>She steps towards the bed, running the soft, worn ear of the rabbit between her fingers. Her thumb catches on the little embroidered ‘N’ rio had sewn into it, scared he would take it to pre-school and it would fall into the clutches of some other sniveling toddler and never make it home.</p><p>Agatha takes a deep breath, closing her eyes. Slowly, she peels back the sodden bandages to peer at the infected wound of her grief, exposing the oozing flesh to the cool air so that she can ask it, like a goddamn magic 8 ball, if it would have been worse if they had known beforehand.</p><p>If she’d had to watch him crumble slowly rather than all at once. If it had been not a desperate 911 call in the night but months of trips to specialists in Boston and tens of thousands of dollars poured into scraping together a few extra days with him.</p><p>The truth, of course, is that it’s an impossible question and she’ll never get a clear answer. She might as well be asking if it’s preferable to be bludgeoned to death in one go or tortured for months on end until her heart gives out. Both agonizing, both unimaginable.</p><p>Agatha steps back from the bed, flicking the light off and quietly shutting the door once more before shuffling back to her room.</p><p>The week passes with little fuss. On Thursday night, Agatha stays home.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha finds herself unwillingly adjusting to her new normal, where Wanda has started to frequently text her and Lilia hangs around at the end of Zoom meetings to gossip and her phone buzzes with unchecked notifications from the support group.</p><p>It feels like being pried in half like an oyster, the knife blade sinking in to the hilt to ensure all of her hidden corners are exposed directly to the light.</p><p>For three years she had painstakingly crafted a new life from the rubble of the one before it– a flimsy thing built on rage-fueled isolation and self reliance– only to be made to sit and watch as everyone takes their individual sledgehammers to it.</p><p>The coffee shop incident in February should have been an omen, Agatha now realizes. A warning sign that she needed to get the hell out of dodge.</p><p>But of course she hadn’t. Instead, she’d held onto the stubborn belief that things would carry on in what she had come to believe was the natural order– a cycle that would repeat over and over until some other terrible thing came along and took even that.</p><p>There had been no great collapse, though. No splitting apart of the sky, no final test for her to fail. Just a knock at her door. Just a stack of papers about a lawsuit dredging up every memory she can’t forget.</p><p>The world is operating differently now than it was six months ago, and Agatha has made her unsteady peace with this fact.</p><p>So when a knock sounds at her door at 9 p.m. on a Tuesday in the last week of May, Agatha pauses her show and sets down her wine glass before navigating from the couch to the foyer, tightening the knot on her robe as she goes. She almost misses the signs. Almost forgets.</p><p>But when she’s close enough to see Rio’s silhouette through the distorted glass of the front door, Agatha freezes for just one moment.</p><p>After her last house call, Agatha had thought that this part of the cycle must be over, no longer worth Rio’s time. Still, she waits on the other side of the door all the same, shifting from foot to foot. Patient, like she has no doubt that Agatha will answer eventually.</p><p>Desire and embarrassment and indignation twine around one another in a heady cocktail and curl up the length of Agatha’s spine, mixing with the wine in her blood.</p><p>Rio had crossed the line after the meeting, had made a goddamn fool out of her in that bathroom. Rio had fucked her in public and walked away like it was nothing and yet she had the audacity to come home like nothing had changed.</p><p>Rio has come home. Nothing has changed.</p><p>Agatha flings the front door open and pulls Rio through by the neck of her hoodie, blindly slamming it shut as she crashes their lips together. Her kiss is all take– a claim and a challenge– and Rio puts up the barest hint of a fight before succumbing to Agatha’s determination.</p><p>Agatha wrestles them both up the stairs, refusing to let them disconnect for even a second. There are nails dragging down skin and bruises sucked into a throat and the jerky removal of clothes, but never a separation.</p><p>By the time they reach the bedroom, Rio is bare and bruised, flushed and breathless. And yet, when Agatha shoves Rio down onto the bed and looks into her eyes for the first time tonight, something dull has settled behind her irises, something muted. She ignores the suspicion it brings to her throat.</p><p>No words are spoken between them. Not when Agatha sheds her robe, not when she flips Rio onto her stomach and pulls her hips into the air, not when she rakes her nails down the toned expanse of Rio’s back.</p><p>Only their harsh breathing permeates the room, their out-of-sync inhalations like nails on a chalkboard.</p><p>Something is wrong here. Agatha can feel it, but it stays just out of her grasp.</p><p>Maybe it only feels that way because the cycle has been disturbed by all of the other bullshit. Maybe it’s only that after hearing Rio’s voice so often in the past few months it feels odd to be deprived of it now.</p><p>Yes, that must be it. But this part has never come with the expectation of verbal interaction, only physical. So Agatha pushes away the strangeness and lowers her mouth to Rio’s waiting cunt, letting herself forget everything other than the taste and the sounds and the feeling of this.</p><p>She wrings orgasm after orgasm out of her ex wife with her fingers and her mouth, stopping only when Rio’s hips fall back to the bed, shaking too hard to keep herself upright any longer.</p><p>Agatha licks her lips and wipes her hand on the bed, watching as Rio’s prone form continues to tremble. Though she can’t be sure exactly what triggers it, the alarm bell starts to ring in her head, her slowing pulse beginning to pick back up in her chest. Unsure how to turn it back off, Agatha slowly reaches a hand out toward Rio, leaving it hovering when she realizes she’s not sure what a safe place to touch would be. If there’s a safe place to touch.</p><p>Rio flips onto her back before Agatha can decide, finding her on her knees with one hand splayed in the air between them. Her face is devoid of makeup and of rage, holding something indecipherable in its stead.</p><p>Her cheeks are blotchy from where her face has been pressed into the bed, stray hairs sticking to her sweaty forehead. Agatha knows that the woman from the bathroom is still one and the same, only wearing a less visible set of armor.</p><p>Her fangs could come out at any moment and tear their way through Agatha’s trachea. And still, she lets her hand finish its descent, tracing the tip of one nail from Rio’s shoulder down to the crook of her arm and letting her touch rest over the pulse there.</p><p>She’s not looking into Rio’s face, and so she doesn’t see when the veil that makes her thoughts illegible is lifted to reveal tonight’s weapon of choice: remorse.</p><p>“I shouldn’t have agreed to join the lawsuit for you. I could’ve just done it on my own but I roped you in anyway. That wasn’t fair,” Rio apologizes. The words come out thick, like she’s been holding them in her throat all night.</p><p>Agatha yanks her finger back from Rio’s arm as if burnt, finding her face with a nauseating shock.</p><p><em> Fair. </em> Rio hasn’t come here tonight because she missed Agatha– or at least sex with Agatha. She’s here because she knew that Agatha would take charge and in some fucked up, psychologically hellish sort of way, thought that it would be <em> fair. </em></p><p>Had let Agatha scratch and bite and fuck her, throw her around and make her scream, because then they would be even. An act of penance. A pity fuck.</p><p>Bile rises to Agatha’s throat, burning in her nose, and she launches herself off the bed with record speed, hurtling into the bathroom and slamming the door behind her.</p><p>She retches into the toilet, falling to her knees on the tile floor with a painful thud.</p><p>Agatha’s not sure how long she stays there, dry heaving every time she thinks about it again until she’s finally sure her body must be empty. She feels dirty, though not from the sweat on her body or the vomit on her tongue or the remnants of Rio’s arousal between her fingers. Unclean in a way she knows will linger.</p><p>There is no great collapse to the cycle, only this– an act of love turned into a battlefield turned into an emotionless transaction. A feeling that lands somewhere squarely between rejection and shame, souring in her gut.</p><p>Rio is long gone by the time Agatha leaves the bathroom. The only traces of her left behind are the slow-drying spots on the bed. Agatha spends the night on the couch.</p><hr/><p>In the grainy video in the corner of her screen, Agatha wagers there’s a 50% chance that everyone else on this Zoom call can tell that she’s not paying attention, doodling little flowers and stars across her otherwise blank notebook page.</p><p>She props up her chin with her hand, glancing back towards the screen every other minute or so just in case they’re talking about something that actually matters. It’s another client trying to decide how to run a ‘tasteful’ Pride campaign, though the month of June started days ago.</p><p>When her phone buzzes where she’s left it face down on the desk, Agatha’s almost certain it’s a message from Lilia telling her to show some professionalism.</p><p>Already crafting a snarky response in her head, Agatha sets her pen down and reaches out to the phone, flipping it over and scanning the message that lights up the screen. Her stomach drops, all of the nonchalance from a moment ago gone.</p><p><b>Rio: </b> <em> Stephen would like to do deposition prep with you on the 20th. We’ll be together for the actual hearing, but my schedule didn’t line up for this. </em></p><p>A link to a calendar invite from Stephen follows the message.</p><p>A cold dread pools in her veins, seeping from her heart and into her fingertips. How has a text from Rio even gone through? Agatha’s had her blocked for <em> years</em>–</p><p><em> That fucking snake</em>, she seethes. Rio must have unblocked herself while Agatha was in the bathroom last week. The thought makes her sick all over again. She eyes the trash can in the corner of her home office warily. </p><p>Agatha forces herself to set the phone back down, pointing her eyes unseeingly back to the laptop. At least she’ll get to handle this prep meeting by herself and without the prying eyes of an audience. Agatha’s not afraid of Stephen or his stupid questions or whatever he thinks he can say to prepare her. She’s just frustrated is all. Displeased to have to waste her afternoon in another meeting.</p><p>Opening her phone again to accept the invite and put the date in her calendar, Agatha grimaces. It’s the same day as Wanda’s big end of year party. Not that she was planning on going, but it still feels wrong to have had the choice taken from her.</p><p>She opens her messages back up to text Wanda as much, but pauses when the app opens back to her thread with Rio. Her eyes fall to the small contact photo, unchanged from when she’d set it nearly a decade ago. It’s nothing more than a candid shot of Rio on their couch, taken while she’d been animatedly explaining some niche fact or another to Agatha.</p><p>Even in its distorted, pixelated form Agatha can see the light in her eyes, the pure joy radiating off of her. She can almost slip into her old skin and remember what it felt like to love and be loved that much, to the point where a silly off-center photo of someone can rival the Mona Lisa in your mind’s eye.</p><p>She tries to compare the woman in the photo to the woman from last week, cold and unfeeling in her bed. Calculating enough that she took the time to unblock herself while Agatha was violently sick just on the other side of the door.</p><p>Maybe Rio had been right. Maybe she never really knew her at all.</p><p>Agatha rolls her tense shoulders before finally clicking away, shooting off her text to Wanda. When she looks back to her laptop, everyone is waiting for her to present.</p><p>When Agatha pulls into the parking lot of the law firm for the second time, she is considerably less nervous. She gets out of her car and walks straight to the doors, easily riding the elevator up and navigating back down the same halls. This time she doesn’t stop at the conference room but instead walks three doors down to where a little plaque reads <em> Stephen Strange, Partner. </em></p><p>She knocks on the cracked door, rolling her eyes at his overly cheery “come in!”</p><p>Agatha slips in and closes the door behind her. Though he seems to be high up at the firm, Strange’s office is remarkably cramped, covered in binders and books of laws and scattered pens. The desk he sits behind is cheaply made and Agatha can see a rip in the arm of his chair beneath the sleeve of his suit.</p><p>“Ms. Harkness, it’s so nice to see you again.”</p><p>He rises to shake Agatha’s hand before settling back down, motioning for her to take the chair on the opposite side. She complies, smoothing her hands over her navy slacks and straightening out her white button up before crossing her legs and folding her hands in her lap.</p><p>She wonders if he’ll put them both through the torture of small talk. Luckily, this doesn’t seem to be the case.</p><p>“I know this may be a bit difficult, but the Perlman Clinic has hired some of the most notoriously ruthless defense lawyers in Massachusetts, so we have to be sure all of our bases are covered. Some of the questions they ask will feel like an overreach and if I can object to any of them I will, but we have to be prepared to give them answers in a way that they can’t use against us. Does that make sense?” He explains, his tone polite but gentle.</p><p>“Yes, Stephen, I understand how a deposition works. Now give me the questions, I don’t have all day.”</p><p>“Alright, but let me know if you need a break at any point.”</p><p>Agatha nods, motioning with her hand for him to continue. Strange opens the manilla folder in front of him on the desk and clicks his pen, beginning down a line of questions he seems to have printed just for the occasion.</p><p>“Okay, first question. Why did you and Ms. Vidal use a donor?”</p><p>Agatha snorts, surprised. “Neither of us has a dick, sadly, and we couldn’t figure out the right spell to make him from scratch.” Strange nods, jotting something down and ignoring her sarcasm.</p><p>“Why did you choose the Perlman Clinic?”</p><p>“Because we lived in the city at the time and it made geographical sense. Plus they seemed reputable.”</p><p>The lawyer grimaces, writing down notes beneath the question. “Maybe we stay away from calling them reputable. They might turn it back around later to cast doubt on their wrongdoings.”</p><p>Agatha tilts her head, not having considered that angle. Maybe Stephen has his job for a reason, she concedes, though she’ll never say as much.</p><p>“Next question. What exactly did the doctors say was Nicholas’ cause of death?”</p><p>Agatha falters for the first time, unconsciously tightening her fingers in her lap.</p><p>“They said he had a ruptured aneurysm in his brain that caused a hemorrhagic stroke. In the autopsy they found that he had an aortic aneurysm too, but that it hadn’t ruptured and he hadn’t had any symptoms that we could have noticed. So I guess the aneurysm caused the stroke caused his death,” she finishes, tapering off as she catches herself rambling.</p><p>Strange nods, his face a mask of concentration as he looks down at his sheet. “You can’t say ‘I guess,’ they’ll swoop in like vultures,” he says with little inflection, like he’s forgotten she’s there.</p><p>“But that all lines up with the autopsy report and the notes from his doctors that I have here,” he adds, flipping through the other papers in the folder to check himself. Agatha’s stomach clenches when she sees a copy of his birth certificate. It must have all come from Rio, then. The indignant rage prickles at the base of her skull.</p><p>“Did you or did you not believe that your son’s death was a result of wrongdoing by the Perlman Clinic at any point before you were approached about this lawsuit?”</p><p>This one Agatha takes a moment to consider, letting herself parse through her thoughts before she speaks.</p><p>“I think– I mean, the doctors were very clear that it was a genetic abnormality that caused Nicky’s aneurysms, and the two sets of genes in his body were from Rio and from the donor. Rio did a genetic screening before we harvested her eggs and her results were clear.”</p><p>Strange nods, settling in like that’s exactly what he expected her to bring up. Unsettled, Agatha shifts in her seat.</p><p>“You said you and Ms. Vidal utilized her egg to conceive your son. At the time that you made this decision, you were aware that Ms. Vidal did not have knowledge of her own family medical history nor did she have a way to access that information. Is that correct?”</p><p>Puzzled, Agatha can only answer honestly. “Yes?”</p><p>“And are you aware that while genetic screening is an important tool, one’s family medical history can often help to identify individuals with a higher risk of less common genetic conditions that are not readily detectable through genetic screening?”</p><p>Her mouth goes dry, and when she swallows it feels like rubbing sandpaper against the walls of her throat. “Yes.”</p><p>“Ms. Harkness, can you explain why you used Ms. Vidal’s egg to conceive your son when her genetic makeup was guesswork at best, leaving Nicholas vulnerable to a whole host of potential ailments?”</p><p>There are a million and one true answers to Stephen Strange’s question, and not one of them will be what he wants to hear.</p><p>Agatha had agreed to use Rio’s egg because of a childhood spent in a house with Evanora Harkness, where a beating was as commonplace as a bedtime story is for some children. There were nights of being sent to bed without dinner and days of tip toeing around, desperate to avoid Evanora’s wrath, desperate to just be good enough that she would spare Agatha the belt.</p><p>She thinks about years of hatred and abuse ingrained so deep in her bones that she still wakes up in the middle of the night with a racing pulse, gasping for air and unable to calm down until she’s sure she’s not in that house anymore, that she really made it out.</p><p>Nearly shy even just in her own mind, Agatha remembers that she had agreed to use Rio’s egg because she knew that she could save her baby by giving him all of Rio’s goodness and none of her own cursed blood.</p><p>Agatha had chosen to use Rio’s egg because of the girl that she met in freshman year orientation who had become her wife, winning her over with flowers and terrible jokes and that same sharp, dark edge that she had always recognized in herself. The girl that had lost her parents before she could talk and had been tossed from foster home to foster home until she aged out of the system.</p><p>Agatha had done it because there had been nobody else in the world that shared the brilliant and beautiful DNA of Rio Vidal, and that thought had been too heartbreaking to bear. In using her egg Agatha would get to see that radiant smile in two faces and not just one, and that had been reason enough.</p><p>She takes a shuddering breath, hoping it will steady her.</p><p>“Because it was what made sense for us. Rio’s test results displayed no concerning results regarding aneurysms, strokes, or any of the other disorders that could increase their likelihood. She was perfect.”</p><p>Strange looks like he might have something to say, but he looks back down at the paper instead, leaving a note and nodding at Agatha encouragingly.</p><p>They work their way through another swath of questions, hammering down the details of the timeline of their involvement with the clinic, specific choices about the donor that they used, and the prenatal care that Agatha received.</p><p>As soon as he suggests they call it a day Agatha shoots from her chair, offering a terse goodbye and throwing herself back out into the hallway. Only when she makes it to the safe chrome doors of the elevator does she exhale, closing her eyes and rubbing at her aching temples.</p><p><em> That was just the prep</em>, she reminds herself. <em> That was him going easy on you</em>. Agatha squeezes her eyes tighter, only popping them open again when the elevator ding notifies her she’s made it back to the lobby.</p><p>The sick dread that has been building since Rio showed up at her door seems to have increased tenfold, weighing her down and slowing her steps.</p><p>She’s going to have to do that again, but with Rio next to her and some hotshot lawyers that will be out for blood asking the questions. She’ll have to relive it all again and worse– will have to listen to Rio talk about it too.</p><p>Back in her car, Agatha drives without thought to the cemetery, parking in her usual spot. From the trunk she retrieves the pretty fake flowers she’d picked up the week before and carries them over to his grave, kneeling directly onto the grass and getting to work.</p><p>Agatha brushes off the headstone with her hands, clearing away dirt and twigs and grass shavings. With a tissue from her pocket she wipes out the divots of the lettering, making sure each dip and curve is pristine. When she’s done, Agatha pulls the last set of plastic flowers she left from their vase and replaces them with the ones she brought– shiny sunflowers and lilies.</p><p>Studiously she ignores the very real bouquet that Rio has clearly left on the other side of the headstone, flowering beautifully in a thick ceramic vase and surrounding her with their fresh scent.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t speak to him while she cleans like she normally would, too caught up in the wounds that had been reopened in Strange’s office. He knows she’s there anyway, surely.</p><p>When she runs out of tasks Agatha sits back on her heels, the sharp ends of her pumps digging into her ass through her slacks. She sets her hands on her knees, bracing her arms and taking a moment to breathe. The breeze pushes her hair where it hangs around her face, and Agatha tries for several long minutes to get herself together.</p><p>Finally she sighs, leaning over and pressing her fingers past the grass and into the cool earth.</p><p>“I know you would want me to help them. You always told me to just be brave,” she whispers brokenly.</p><p>Agatha feels a tear slip past her lashes and down the curve of her nose, watches it fall and disappear into the grass.</p><p>“It is <em> so hard </em> to be brave without you.”</p><p>She lets herself cry for the first time in a long time before she hears another car door shut somewhere in the cemetery, reminding her that this is not the time or the place. Wiping her eyes, Agatha grabs the old flowers, drops a kiss to Nicky’s headstone, and goes home.</p>

<p>The ghosts in Agatha’s house grow more restless after her deposition prep.</p><p>They wake her in the night to a cold sweat and a jarring sense of loneliness, or bear down when she makes her tea in the morning. It leaves her on edge in a way that she thinks no one has noticed, until Lilia wraps up their team meeting with a request for Agatha to stay on.</p><p>From the mounted camera that Lilia uses in her office, Agatha can see the full image of her boss seated at her desk, somehow managing to level her with an unimpressed look all the way from Boston.</p><p>“I don’t know what that lawyer said to you, but it’s got you off your game. You’ve been too quiet,” Lilia says once they’re alone on the call. As always, there’s no question she’s asking, no argument she’s looking for. Just the opening of a door with the option to walk through it. Agatha twirls her pen around in her hand.</p><p>“Would you rather I be louder? You’re always telling me to chill out in meetings anyway,” Agatha deflects. Lilia shakes her head, pursing her lips.</p><p>“I don’t tell you to ‘chill out,’” she makes air quotes around the words with her fingers. “I ask you not to call people names or make threats of violence. I never said you couldn’t be loud.”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, waving a hand at her computer screen as if to say <em> same thing</em>.</p><p>“Maybe you should try out that support group that the other plaintiffs have. Aren’t they meeting tonight?” Lilia presses. Silently, Agatha berates herself once more for her stupidity. She’d added the meetings to her calendar, forgetting to set them to private. Lilia had asked about it almost immediately.</p><p>“And subject myself to a cesspool of other people’s wallowing? Fat chance.”</p><p>“How could it be worse than the cesspool of your own wallowing? At least regular sad people make excellent baked goods, so you can count on that. Plus I bet your friends Allie and Jade will be there,” she cajoles. </p><p>Against her better judgement, Agatha feels herself starting to wear down. It’s only been a few days since she'd been in Stephen's office, but she’s yet to escape the stain it’s left– a lingering anxiety not unlike that of a prey animal. A night spent with the support group would at least mean less time spent in her own house.</p><p>“Their names are Alice and Jen, Calderu. And they’re not my friends.” Lilia’s cackling laugh is the last thing Agatha hears before hanging up.</p><p>Standing in front of her bedroom mirror at 5:30, knowing she has to leave soon if she’s going to make it at all, Agatha gives her outfit a final once over. She’s gone for something simple– not entirely sure what to expect from this crowd– in a pair of loose linen pants and a plain black top. Her sunglasses serve as a headband where they’re perched atop her head and her strappy black platform sandals give her the confidence boost of a few extra inches.</p><p>She twists her watch on her wrist and smooths out her wrinkle-free pants one last time. <em>There’s no reason to be nervous</em>, she reminds herself. Nobody will be looking for her weaknesses or trying to knock her off balance. They have too much of their own shit going on.</p><p>And if it’s awful, she can just leave. There’s always that.</p><p>Pulling up to the parking lot outside of the local middle school gym feels weird in a way that Agatha can’t entirely put her finger on. Part of it is being at a school in the summer time, with its hushed, empty halls and vacant bus lot. Part is surely being a grown woman walking up to those wide double doors by herself, giving a wary side eye to the painted cartoon horse and its “Go Stallions!” speech bubble.</p><p>Part of it is knowing that he would have been here this year. That she would have driven this route to drop him off and pick him up five days a week from August to June.</p><p>The gymnasium doors squeal open when Agatha pushes through. The small lobby is empty, the metal shutters pulled over the concession stand. Doors with little windows lead into the gym on either side of a large wooden trophy case, and Agatha peers curiously through the nearest one.</p><p>On the shiny wooden floors, several small groups of adults are milling about, chatting with one another. To one side, she sees a white plastic folding table boasting paper plates and an assortment of cookies and sandwiches, a pitcher of lemonade and a stack of cups on the far end.</p><p>Maybe Lilia was right about regular sad people and baking.</p><p>On the far side of the gym Agatha can make out a group of kids of varying ages playing some sort of game with a basketball. There aren’t many of them, she notices. Not nearly as many as the adults.</p><p>Agatha finishes her scan, torn between going inside to prove that she can and bolting back to the safety of her car. The decision is made for her when she catches motion in the side of her vision and turns her head, finding Alice offering her a slight wave. Jen and the other couple they must be talking to all turn to look at her and Agatha feels her face flush.</p><p>Not wanting to linger in the sensation, she turns the handle and steps into the gym, taken aback by the sharp smell of the wax used to buff the floors and the hum of the fluorescent overhead lights. Some heads turn, but mostly people stick to their conversations, absorbed in their own worlds. <em> Good</em>. That’s what she’d been hoping for.</p><p>Alice steps away from the group to greet Agatha, offering a small smile.</p><p>“Hey. I’m glad you could come.” Alice seems genuinely pleased, leaving the weeks that have passed since she first told Agatha about the group unacknowledged.</p><p>Agatha crosses her arms over her chest, not in defense but like a security blanket.</p><p>“Thanks,” she shrugs. “I had deposition prep with Stephen this week. Figured I’d see if it sucked ass for everyone else too.”</p><p>Alice huffs a laugh. “Dude, it felt like getting my shit rocked. At one point Jen had to physically get up and take a lap of the building to calm down.”</p><p>Agatha breathes a small sigh of relief. At least it had been just as bad for the others and she wasn’t some anomaly in her weakness. Her eyes start to wander around the room again, taking in the attendees without the window’s blur distorting their features. Noticing, Alice takes a half step closer, lowering her voice.</p><p>“Those,” she nods to a younger couple, teary-eyed and whispering to each other by the snack table, “are the Haymans. Their baby only lived a year, died back in February. A cardiovascular thing.” </p><p>Alice shifts, gesturing to a tall, muscular woman with short-cropped blonde hair listening attentively to an older couple. “That’s Carol. Her daughter’s been dead a while, I think, but she doesn’t really talk about it.” She tilts her head, like she’s just remembered something.</p><p>“A lot of people can’t make it every time, since the clinic is in Boston and lots of people traveled to it in the first place. We’re a bit scattered around the state, so it’s nice when people can stop by.”</p><p>Alice gives similar synopses for the majority of the attendees, loading Agatha down with faces and names she’d be hard pressed to remember with a gun to her head. It was one thing to see all of the names on the group’s page, but it’s another to see several of them here in person, real people living real lives and not just pictures on a screen.</p><p>It feels like finally seeing the invisible string tying her to the rest of them.</p><p>She tries not to be, but Agatha’s surprised Rio isn't here. Whether it’s relief or disappointment, though, she can’t tell. The feelings tangle up in her chest, knotting over themselves. The only certainty is that it feels strange.</p><p>“And those,” Alice sighs, finally reaching the end of her introduction speech and motioning to the couple still talking to a clearly over it Jen, “are the Kaplans. They were the second couple to join the suit. And they come to every meeting.”</p><p>Without another word, Alice strides back over to her previous position. “Jeff, Rebecca, this is Agatha,” Alice says, donning what must be her hostess tone.</p><p>With no other option, Agatha wills her feet forward, inserting herself into their little circle between a visibly relieved Jen and Rebecca, offering what she hopes comes off as a smile and not the grimace that it is.</p><p>“Hi there, Agatha! It’s so nice to meet you. Any friend of Alice and Jen’s is a friend of ours!” Jeff winks, offering his hand. Agatha suppresses an eye roll and shakes the offered palm, turning to do the same to Rebecca. She remembers she’s supposed to verbally respond, too.</p><p>“Hello. Nice to meet you both.” It feels sufficient. Rebecca offers a warm smile.</p><p>They’re older than she is by at least a decade, if she had to guess. Jeff is starting to bald and Rebecca’s dark hair is noticeably greying, the laugh lines around her eyes visible even when her face relaxes. They seem far more chipper than the somber atmosphere that she’d been expecting.</p><p>“We were so glad to hear that another couple was joining the lawsuit. It’s just so important, you know? To be able to do this for our kids,” Rebecca explains. Her gentle voice blares like an air horn against Agatha’s ear drum. Before Agatha can correct her Jeff nods along, putting an arm around his wife’s shoulders.</p><p>“Our William had NF1. The doctors told us not to worry, but one of his tumors ended up being cancer,” Jeff explains, a bittersweet smile on his face and a tone that says <em> what can you do? </em> “We got fifteen fantastic years with our boy though, and we wouldn’t trade ‘em for anything.”</p><p>As he talks Jeff pulls his phone from his pocket, turning the screen to face Agatha. It’s a photo of a teen lounging on a couch, sporting the thickest rings of eyeliner Agatha thinks she’s ever seen. His mop of dark, curly hair flops down to his eyebrows, drawing focus to the metal rod pierced through one.</p><p>His smile looks forced but good-humored, like he knows exactly why his dad wants to take so many pictures of him but still has that teenage desire to push back.</p><p>The Kaplans seem like they love talking about William and will take any excuse to do so– confirmed by a sideways glance at Alice and Jen, who have undoubtedly heard this same spiel a thousand times.</p><p>Theirs is nothing like her own life, but it still feels like pressing on a bruise, exacerbated by the overstimulation of the whole evening. Agatha smiles, knowing it doesn’t reach her eyes. “He seems like a good kid.”</p><p>The Kaplans light up, like that was exactly what they’d hoped she would say. Like there’s anything else you’re allowed to say when presented with a picture of someone’s dead kid. Jeff pockets the phone again, turning that same cheery smile back to her.</p><p>“I’m sure Nicky was a very sweet boy too, Agatha. We met Rio a few weeks back– what a wonderful woman. With parents like you two, I’m sure any kid would be very loved,” he nods, as if moved by his own words.</p><p>At her side, Agatha can see Alice and Jen exchange a look. She can’t think about that, though. She’s too busy trying not to vomit on everyone’s shoes.</p><p>Maybe the Nicky stuff she could have expected. Jeff is clearly trying, in his oblivious white man way, to give her space to talk about her son in a room full of people that are probably all about that sort of thing. But she hadn’t come here to be reminded of the past, to be made to think about their time as mothers or what a <em> wonderful woman </em> Rio is. If anything, she'd come to let other people's anxieties drown out her own.</p><p>The hunted feeling that had stayed with her since Stephen’s office ratchets up in her chest, like the sniper’s sights are trained between her eyes and it’s either she makes a run for it or lets her brain matter paint the floor like a runny egg yolk.</p><p>“If you all would excuse me, I have got to piss like a racehorse.” She gestures vaguely behind herself with a thumb.</p><p>Agatha catches the sign on the far end of the gym and turns on her heel, walking past Carol and the snack table and the weepy couple that has settled on the bleachers. Giving a wide berth to the gaggle of children around the hoop, Agatha swings down a side hall and into the bathroom, which turns out to be the girls’ locker room.</p><p>It reeks of a thousand different Bath &amp; Body Works perfume scents, all sprayed ten times more than necessary and mixing with one another into a noxious cloud. Agatha curves away from the row of lockers to a line of sinks, gripping the edge of the nearest one staring into her reflection. <em> It’s nothing, Harkness. This is nothing. </em></p><p>Agatha pulls a paper towel from the dispenser on the wall, dampening it in the sink and patting gingerly at her forehead. Her hands are shaking, she realizes, and why are all of these lights so fucking bright?</p><p>She shouldn’t have come to this fuck ass meeting, shouldn’t have taken Lilia’s awful advice. Rio should never have signed them up for this thing in the first place– should never had agreed on her behalf and certainly shouldn’t have shown up at her house and apologized for it.</p><p>And where the fuck is Rio anyway? Why is she not here? Sure, Agatha hadn’t told her that she would come tonight despite her number being unblocked. But <em> why </em> hadn’t she come?</p><p>And who do these people think they are, prying their grubby little fingers into her business? How is she supposed to fend them off without breaking any of the rules of polite society? How do people even survive events like this, really? Rio always knew how to play the part, waltzing through insufferable conversations like they were a silly dance she’d been born knowing the steps to.</p><p>Nobody ever guessed that she was just as annoyed or pissed off or entertained as Agatha, missing all of her small tells. Agatha never missed them, though. Always caught the widening of her eyes or the strain of her smiles or the barely there flit of her gaze to meet her own. Agatha only knows full speed, full volume.</p><p>Agatha hears the door swing open again and takes a steadying breath, wringing excess water from her paper towel into the sink. Jen catches her eye in the mirror behind her for less than a second, continuing past and stopping in front of the full length mirror at the end of the row of sinks.</p><p>Agatha spares herself another quick glance in the mirror, confirming that she still looks composed and not like a total basket case. But it doesn’t seem to matter, because Jen is simply adjusting her jewelry, twisting her layered necklaces and tightening the back of her earring, not looking at Agatha at all.</p><p>Not yet ready to leave the bathroom but without another task, Agatha begins the motions of washing her hands. She almost misses it when Jen starts to speak. her tone almost bored.</p><p>“Jeff is so fucking nosy. I swear to god if he tries to give me one more sympathy hug, I am going to slap him.”</p><p>Agatha, caught off guard by her candor, snorts a quiet laugh. She keeps her eyes on her hands when the silence falls again. Jen uncaps a lipstick from her pocket with a <em> pop</em>, leaning forward to apply the pigment with a light hand and inspecting her work.</p><p>“I don’t want to have to come to this pathetic support group or hear about how everyone’s kids are dead. I don’t want them to ogle my living child or deal with their questions about how sick she is or spend every other Thursday night in this nasty pre-teen hellscape.”</p><p>She pauses, swiping the nail of her pinky delicately along her bottom lip to clean up her lip line before leaning back and finally looking over at Agatha, who has given up the ruse of washing her hands to listen.</p><p>“But it’s what Alice needs to feel in control. So, here I am.”</p><p>Agatha considers Jen for a moment, feeling her panic ebb slightly at the words. Still, something nags at her.</p><p>“Why are you saying any of this to me?”</p><p>It comes out more defensive than she intends. Because while Jen doesn’t seem like the type, Agatha wonders if this is how she exhibits pity. But Jen only gives her what is possibly the largest eye roll she’s ever seen, crossing her arms across her chest like she cannot believe how dense Agatha is.</p><p>“<em>Because, </em>you seem like you’re always one stupid comment away from blowing up on everyone in a three mile radius, and it can be helpful to know that you’re not the only miserable person here.” Jen tilts her head, a mirror of Alice an hour before.</p><p>“And because I’m afraid that if she dies, I’ll turn into you,” she says with a shrug, like that’s something normal to say to a person, before walking straight past Agatha and back out of the locker room.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t know if she should be flattered or offended, finding herself adrift in the murky sea between the two. But she does know one thing for sure– Jen isn’t handling any of this better than Alice is. She’s just handling it quieter.</p><p>And Jen is just as unwilling to share Lorna as she is to share Nicky, she realizes. Maybe if he was still alive, she’d put up less of a fight, too. Would do damn near anything if it felt like a way to get the upper hand somehow.</p><p>Agatha runs a hand down her face, resolving to let herself slip out the back and just walk around the outside of the building to get back to her car. Certainly it would be a better fate than subjecting herself to the Kaplans or facing Jen and Alice's knowing looks.</p><p>Just as she makes her way back down the short hallway and sets her eyes on a back exit, Agatha catches a tiny mass of dark hair and brown, watchful eyes in her path. Lorna tugs at a stray curl, her pink shirt boasting a stain that looks like a parting gift from a popsicle.</p><p>“Are you leaving?” She asks, her small voice full of youthful curiosity. Agatha nods, feeling herself shift into someone gentler.</p><p>“Yeah, I need to head home. It’s almost my bedtime.”</p><p>She gives a smile, but Lorna only looks at her– the spitting image of Alice with that off putting, all-seeing expression. Finally, she smiles back, showing off the gap left by a missing tooth.</p><p>“Okay. Bye!” And then she’s gone as quickly as she came, heading back to the gaggle of kids. Agatha’s eyes follow her, feeling something in her chest begin to shift.</p><p>She can feel a set of eyes watching her and knows that it’s Jen. Agatha doesn’t look back as she leaves.</p><p>The drive home is thankfully easy, and Agatha beelines for the kitchen as soon as she makes it inside. She pulls the bottle from the fridge and pours herself an arguably large glass of wine, immediately bringing it to her lips and taking a gulp before placing the glass on the counter.</p><p>Agatha breathes in through her nose, letting go of a shaky exhale. This whole thing needs to be over so that she can go back to how things were. Yes, the past several years had been agonizing, but at least it was the kind of pain that she’d adjusted to.</p><p>Frogs in boiling water and all that.</p><p>This new normal is like being burnt at the stake– the slow, precise rise of the flames and the knowledge that everyone around is going to watch her flail and cry for help and that there’s nothing she can do to make it stop.</p><p>Agatha has always been good at internalizing her problems, folding them smaller and smaller inside of herself and lashing out to alleviate the pressure when it became too much. If the problems stay inside of her, then nobody else can be shredded apart by the inevitable implosion. That's what she'd learned last time.</p><p>If all of it stays buried in her chest and in her hands and behind her teeth, then Agatha can be the only casualty. It’s safest this way.</p><p>Her phone buzzes in her pocket and she slides it out, figuring it must be Alice asking where she is after her Irish goodbye.</p><p><b>Rio: </b> <em> Strange says Perlman’s lawyers are settling on a date for our hearing. Lmk if early August works for you. </em></p><p>The frustrated spiral she’d been having before Jen entered the locker room returns, pounding in her ears and throat. While Agatha reads the text, those three little dots appear. She watches the little typing animation, her anticipation increasing by the second.</p><p>After another minute, a second text comes through. It’s a link to the support group chat with a brief, impersonal message below it.</p><p><b>Rio: </b> <em> In case you’re interested. </em></p><p>Agitated, Agatha’s thumbs hover over the screen of her phone, ready to fire off a response.</p><p>
<em> I was there tonight. Where were you? </em>
</p><p>She erases it immediately, tries again to convey how she feels.</p><p>
<em> A little late for that. I fucked Rebecca Kaplan in the girls locker room. </em>
</p><p>No–</p><p>
<em> It was unbearable to be there without you. All of this is unbearable without you. </em>
</p><p>Agatha catches herself, watches her fingers type the words in horror. As if it burns in her hands, Agatha throws her phone over the kitchen island and listens as it lands with a harsh <em> smack </em> on the wooden floors of the living room, sliding until it hits the leg of the couch.</p><p>She pinches the bridge of her nose between her fingers, realizing several seconds too late how fucking stupid that was. How fucking stupid everything in the whole world is, actually.</p><p>She retrieves the phone, picking it up and turning it over to find a long crack down the middle of the screen. <em> Fantastic. </em></p><p>Agatha stops back in the kitchen, downing the rest of her wine and depositing the glass in the sink before heading up the stairs.</p><p>Hopefully the alcohol will dull tonight’s nightmare of choice, if nothing else.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>In a momentary lapse in judgement, Agatha agreed to attend family dinner at the Maximoffs’ as penance for missing their end of year party.</p><p>The end of year party that she hadn’t intended to go to in the first place. That she’d missed because she was forced to endure two torturous hours of being pelted with invasive questions in Stephen Strange’s office. So if anything, Agatha’s pretty sure she’s being punished for being punished. </p><p>Nonetheless, Agatha has made her way down the street in a casual black sundress on the last evening in June to the familiar house, catching the big red ‘M’ painted elegantly on the mailbox at the end of the driveway. She grips the tupperware tighter between her hands as she ascends the steps to the front porch, suddenly more nervous than she thought she’d be.</p><p>It’s a mix of knowing that she’s walking into the first social situation in a while that she can’t just up and leave when things get to be too much and that Billy and Tommy’s attention will be on her, scrutinizing in the way that children can’t help but be.</p><p>She takes a breath, flicking her hair back over her shoulder and fortifying herself. <em> I am not afraid of Wanda Maximoff or her pet man or their demon spawn. </em>Agatha lifts a hand and rings the doorbell.</p><p>Within seconds she can hear footsteps bounding around a corner and up to the other side of the door, culminating in the wood swinging open to reveal a panting Billy, wearing a slightly rumpled Transformers t-shirt and a pair of mismatched socks.</p><p>He opens his mouth, presumably to greet her, but his voice catches when his eyes land on the tupperware in her hands. His eyes seem to bulge out of his head, and Agatha can almost see him begin to vibrate with excitement.</p><p>“SHE MADE THE BROWNIES,” he yells, pummeling her with his ten year old voice from a foot away. From somewhere within the house, Tommy gives a responding screech and begins barreling to the door to see the treasure with his own eyes.</p><p>There had been a time when Agatha was rather notorious for said brownies, bringing them to neighborhood events or having a fresh pan at the house when the kids would come to play. Mothers had begged for the recipe and their children begged for her to bring them to their birthday parties, but she’d never given up the recipe and never made them under threat of duress.</p><p>It was in the second trimester of her pregnancy that Agatha had woken in a panic, shaking Rio so aggressively that she had sprung out of the bed in her underwear and started packing things at random, convinced Agatha was going into premature labor.</p><p>“Rio,” she’d whispered urgently. “Mothers are supposed to know how to bake things. I can’t even make cookies from the tube!”</p><p>Rio had held her through the hormone-induced tears that had followed, very valiantly holding in her laughter because they both knew Agatha didn't really give a fuck about being able to bake anything. It was that she was afraid of all the things she didn’t know– all of the things that were supposed to come naturally but hadn’t to her own mother and maybe wouldn’t to her, either.</p><p>They baked over twelve trays of brownies in the following weeks, formulating a recipe and tweaking it until it felt like something good enough to give their baby. And it certainly didn’t hurt that other people loved them so much, too. The sugar was a balm to the sting of Agatha’s dry humor and cutting remarks.</p><p>She’d almost forgotten how much of a secret weapon they had been, but the reaction she receives now jogs her memory. From behind Billy and Tommy, Agatha catches the faint smell of something delicious in the kitchen and the soft sounds of jazz music from Vision’s record player.</p><p>The twins ogle the container in her hands, the pair of them stunned into silence at the promise of an impending sugar high. Agatha shifts her weight awkwardly and the beams of the porch groan with the motion. She debates the merits of throwing the brownies into the house behind them as a distraction and making a run for it.</p><p>Wanda’s disembodied voice from the kitchen stops that line of thinking.</p><p>“Boys, stop letting the air out and let Ms. Agatha in. If you keep gaping at her she’s going to run away and take those brownies with her,” she calls, like she can see the exact expressions on their face.</p><p>The boys’ wide-eyed awe on the container pivots to fear and they scamper aside, clearing the way for Agatha to walk past.</p><p>She does as much– muscle memory carrying her through the foyer and into the house. Agatha passes the couch covered in scattered action figures and catches a glimpse of Vision through the sliding glass door, deep in concentration on the back deck, manning the grill in some stupid green apron that reads <em> KISS ME. I’M NOT IRISH BUT I AM BEGGING </em> in big block letters.</p><p>Agatha fights the urge to point and laugh, bypassing the dining table to step up to the kitchen island, where she finds Wanda on the other side stirring something on the stovetop and smiling back at her.</p><p>“Hey, I’m glad you could make it,” she says, scooting a stemless wine glass filled with something sparkling towards Agatha, a matching one resting on the counter near Wanda’s waist. Agatha pulls the glass the rest of the way towards herself after depositing the tupperware in its place like they’re bartering.</p><p>“I said that I would be here,” Agatha responds dismissively, trying to free Wanda from any perception that she needs to be performing for her. But Wanda keeps her smile, sparing a glance to check on whatever’s in the pot.</p><p>“It doesn’t mean I can’t be glad anyway.” Her playful retort pulls a responding eye roll from Agatha, but she can’t fight the upward quirk of her lips.</p><p>Unlike at the support group meeting, Agatha can be almost certain that Wanda isn’t going to send her careening into dangerous territory. This evening will surely be a pain in its own special way, but not the kind that poses a risk to her sanity. Or her phone.</p><p>Agatha takes in her surroundings more fully, realizing there are already multiple plates laden with side dishes spread around Wanda and remembering that Vision was also on the grill. She furrows her brow.</p><p>“Wanda, you do realize there are only five of us, right?” She asks, wondering if Wanda has invited 20 to 30 other people and forgotten to tell her. The thought has her pulse picking up.</p><p>Wanda pulls the pot from the burner, setting it aside to cool. “Agatha, you do realize I have two boys, right? They eat like fucking bottomless pits. It’s obscene.”</p><p>As if on cue, the bottomless pits in question wander out from what Agatha remembers being a playroom and into the kitchen, sidling up near Wanda.</p><p>“Is dinner almost ready?” Tommy asks, looking for all the world like a starving puppy in an ASPCA commercial. Wanda merely ruffles his hair.</p><p>“Almost. Go see if your dad needs help with anything outside.”</p><p>They offer her mock salutes like agents accepting an important mission before tearing back out of the room and through the sliding door. Something inside of Agatha twists sharply, like she’s forgotten to bring something irreplaceable along with her.</p><p>But she brought the brownies and she brought herself. She doesn’t have anything else.</p><p>Her phone buzzes in her pocket, saving her from the feeling. Agatha slides it out and reads the message, but it’s only the support group announcing a change in meeting time for the week, or something just as inconsequential.</p><p>When she puts the device away and brings her eyes back up, Agatha finds Wanda looking at her expectantly, like she’s asked a question. She feels caught somehow, offering a grimace that could almost be construed as an apology.</p><p>“Can you repeat that? I thought it was something important but it was just a group text,” she explains, waving her hand dismissively. Wanda lifts her brows, and it takes Agatha a second to pinpoint her intrigue.</p><p>“Since when do you tolerate a group text? I seem to remember an incident where you threatened to block everyone in the neighborhood if they tried to put you in one of those things.”</p><p>Agatha chews on her bottom lip, leaning into the island counter and watching Wanda move around the kitchen. After a brief internal debate, she begins her explanation with a sigh.</p><p>“Remember the lawsuit thing I told you about?” Wanda nods.</p><p>“There’s this group of some of the plaintiffs that get together and, seemingly, compound their wallowing like every other week. Alice and Jen– the women we saw on the trail– are kind of spearheading the whole thing.” The explanation feels sufficient, but Wanda looks at her over the rim of her wine glass, no longer moving.</p><p>“If you think it’s such a pity party, why are you in the group chat?”</p><p>Agatha crosses her arms defensively, licking her dry lips to buy herself some time.</p><p>“I have to be involved in all of the other business anyway. And it’s the easiest way to find out if hearing dates change or whatever.”</p><p>Wanda nods, unperturbed by Agatha’s visible discomfort.</p><p>“Well, at least you seem to get along with Alice and Jen well enough,” Wanda offers, but Agatha scrunches her face, fighting the urge to bare her teeth.</p><p>“They keep trying to get under my skin, the both of them. It’s like every conversation has to be a <em> thing</em>. We can never just talk about…I don’t know, the weather?”</p><p>Wanda snorts a laugh, setting her wine down and moving to fill both of their glasses before looking back to Agatha.</p><p>“You have never once wanted to talk about the weather, Agatha. Are these people actually trying to get under your skin or are they just, you know, getting close to you and that feels scary?”</p><p>Wanda doesn’t wait for her to respond (though to be clear, her response would have been <em> fuck all the way off </em>) before picking up a plate in each hand. Agatha does the same, following her out to the back deck. They set the plates on the large iron table in the center of the patio, ringed with matching chairs and sporting a large umbrella through the center.</p><p>The table already boasts plates of hot dogs and burgers and grilled vegetables, and Agatha adds the pasta salad and peach and goat cheese salad she’s carried out to the bounty. Wanda calls the boys to help grab a slew of other things still in the kitchen, and by the time they’re done Agatha’s not sure the table will stay up beneath all the weight.</p><p>Vision claps his hands together once they’re all seated, having thankfully taken off his apron.</p><p>“Well everybody, this food won’t eat itself. Let’s dig in!”</p><p>Agatha watches absently as the boys do just that, elbowing one another in the process. The summer scenery around them is beautiful– the cicadas are singing, the sun paints everything in a honey gold hue, and the grass and trees are such a vibrant shade of green that they almost look fake.</p><p>She’s caught between relaxing into the comfort of good food and a nice evening and thrashing against the sense of normalcy that her brain screams is false. An itchy feeling settles beneath her skin.</p><p>But then the boys are talking to her, their mouths full and their eyes alight. Tommy launches into an account of their end of school year party and Billy chimes in with details as he sees fit, the two of them painting a vivid picture of water balloons and face paint and store bought sugar cookies.</p><p>Billy pivots away, his eager mind latching onto a different topic, and very seriously begins to tell her about how he’s learning to roller skate but still falls down a lot. He points to a scrape on his elbow as if to verify.</p><p>“Well if Billy keeps falling then we won’t grow even and I’ll be the tallest kid in fifth grade all by myself,” Tommy asserts around a mouthful of hot dog, to which Billy shoots him a heated look.</p><p>Agatha soaks in their eager chatter, her delight at not having to talk about herself overpowering any annoyance she feels.</p><p>“I think it’ll be pretty hard to be the tallest kid if you’re only three feet tall, Tim. Are the other kids ants?” She taunts, slipping back into the playful snark she’s always donned for the kids. Tommy’s mouth falls open in outrage, a hand flying to his chest to up the drama. Wanda rolls her eyes at the theatrics.</p><p>“I’m <em> not </em> three feet tall! I’m four foot nine and my name is Tommy, Ms. Agatha!” He whines. Agatha takes a sip of her wine, making a sound like ‘I don’t know about that,’ which only eggs Tommy on further. Billy takes up her mantle, much to Wanda and Vision’s chagrin.</p><p>The boys bloom under her direct attention, alight with the feeling of being seen by an adult that isn’t one of their parents. With a pang, Agatha realizes that she’s missed this. Not only had she lost Nicky, but the past three years have taken this from her, too.</p><p>The twins are so much older now– their personalities haven’t changed much, but Agatha finds that they’re so much more articulate, so thoughtful. They’re becoming people.</p><p>She blinks against the unexpected threat of tears that prickle in the corners of her eyes, though she knows they’re not from sadness. Wanda, gracefully, notices.</p><p>“Boys, why don’t you clear the table and then you can bring out those brownies?”</p><p>Billy and Tommy spring into action, stacking plates and cutlery into their arms and ferrying them off to the kitchen. Wanda had been right, they’d devoured most of the spread.</p><p>Maybe it’s the wine that she’s now had two glasses of or maybe it’s the softness that overtakes her around the kids still lingering, but Agatha finds that she’s grateful for Wanda. The admission remains internal, of course.</p><p>The two of them were 'mom friends' in the way that dipped just below the surface before, sure, but it’s as if Nicky’s death has– albeit belatedly– brought them closer instead of severing the tie. Wanda’s outright refusal to leave her in her house to rot when almost everyone else had given up is…nice. The connection doesn’t feel forced either, not even when Agatha agrees to hang out only after direct threat of bodily harm or emotional warfare (she hasn’t forgotten about the thing with the scouts).</p><p>Billy and Tommy bring the brownies back out, breaking her reverie. As soon as they hit the table all four Maximoffs pounce, the adults making no attempt to hide their excitement. Vision, teeth full of chocolate, slides his eyes over to Agatha.</p><p>“Now I know you don’t like to tell people, but–” Agatha cuts him off with a raised hand and an unimpressed look.</p><p>“You’re not getting the recipe Vision. Do not try that shit with me. You know better.”</p><p>Vision looks appropriately chastised, and he poutingly reaches for another brownie as if to console himself. Around a mouthful of chocolatey goo, Billy addresses her.</p><p>“Ms. Agatha, do you remember when we had a sleepover for Nicky’s eighth birthday and you made your brownies for us? We snuck into the kitchen after you and Ms. Rio went to sleep and ate the whole tray.”</p><p>Tommy nods in confirmation. “It was awesome. But then we got <em> so </em> sick.”</p><p>“Worth it,” they say at the same time, not even looking at one another.</p><p>Agatha chuckles along with everyone else, finding that the memory doesn’t hurt like she would think. Instead it brings only fondness and the secondary memory of waking up to the empty tray and knowing exactly what had happened.</p><p>When she walks home later, having refused to take the half-full tupperware back with her despite Wanda’s insistence, the quiet of a suburban night has fallen. The streetlights are on, fireflies play in the shrubbery of the lawns she passes, and frogs call to one another in the dark.</p><p>Maybe, she considers, not everything has to go back to how it was. Maybe a few small changes wouldn’t be so bad.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>July in Massachusetts is shaping up to be sweltering, and the heat has performed the minor miracle of melting away the uncomfortable remnants of her deposition prep and the support group meeting.</p><p>With the space that the discomfort was filling finally free, Agatha finds herself being subjected to a new form of torture– a deep, pervasive horniness.</p><p>Before, she’d been fine in the gaps between trysts with Rio, almost entirely oblivious to any desires, physical or otherwise, until that knock came to her door. Now it’s as though her body is slowly waking up again after a long winter, and all of the eating and going outside and speaking to other people is reminding her mortal shell of its humanity.</p><p>Handling it herself is off the table, though. After last time her brain can’t be trusted not to send her into a post-orgasm tailspin. But things with Rio have gotten far too convoluted, seeping out beyond their once-clear boundaries and bleeding into areas of her life where they don’t belong.</p><p>A new plan is in order. A Rio-free plan. Agatha stands before the full length mirror in her bedroom while deciding as much, adjusting the hem of the shimmering purple dress that stops only a handful of inches below the curve of her ass and shifting side to side in her black open-toed heels. The garment has been lingering in the back of her closet, the tags still attached when she pulled it out. What its intended purpose was she can’t be sure.</p><p>It’ll be easy– she’ll go to a bar, find a woman, and have sex with said woman. It’s a Friday night and Agatha knows she’ll turn heads with this outfit. It doesn’t matter that she hasn’t had sex with anyone but Rio in more or less 20 years, because tonight isn’t about her anyway.</p><p>It’s about getting in a no-strings fuck to sooth the itch and then never think about it again. The perfect solution to draw her thoughts away from the circus of the past few months.</p><p>She calls a car to the bar, not wanting to deal with the hassle of thinking about what to do with her car later. Her driver tries for small talk but quickly gives up when Agatha stonewalls him. She offers a tip when he pulls into the parking lot, not looking back when he calls out a goodnight before entering the building.</p><p>Agatha slips into a stool at the furthest corner of the bar and sets her black clutch on the wood, giving her a perfect view of the place. It’s all dim lighting and fake leather booths and stools with garish neon lights interspersed along the walls. A cluster of pool tables populate the back wall and the music choice seems to be a cross between early 2000’s rock and current pop hits that she doesn’t know.</p><p>There are a healthy amount of people both wedged onto seats and swaying on the dance floor, but the place is nowhere near packed. To be fair, it’s only 9 pm, but there was no way in hell that Agatha was going to start her night much later.</p><p>She catches the bartender’s attention and orders a glass of wine before taking another scan of the room– there’s a group of women crowded at the other end of the bar having what she assumes must be a girls night, and the large corner booth on the other side of the bar is overfilled with people in suits. Agatha suppresses a gag. No tolerable conquests to be found in an office TGIF group.</p><p>A bunch of rowdy men swarm the pool tables, clutching beer bottles and jeering at one another, and the bar’s patrons are otherwise stragglers or small groups of friends. Agatha’s sure she’s spotted at least two or three that she could pick off easily, mentally preparing to make her move once she’s had a bit more of her wine.</p><p>From the direction of the bathrooms behind her, a body jostles into her shoulder. Agatha jumps slightly in her skin at the sudden force, her surprise morphing swiftly to anger. There are all of eight fucking people at this bar, and of course some jackass is breathing down her throat–</p><p><em> Oh</em>. Jasmine. Clean soap. Rio.</p><p>Agatha’s whole body tenses and she fights the urge to turn to look at her, wondering if maybe they don’t make eye contact then this will all just be a mirage and she can carry on with her night. Equally strong is the urge to scream and throw herself from the nearest roof. She fights that one too.</p><p>The decision is made for her when Rio steps just far enough away to slide into a stool of her own, leaving an empty one safely between them that she rests her feet on the rungs of. Rio props her elbow onto the bartop, settling her chin in her hand and turning glassy eyes to Agatha.</p><p>The dark locks around her face and ears have long since fallen from her claw clip and her red tie hangs untied around her neck. Her white collared shirt wrinkled from the day’s work and her sleeves are pushed up past her elbows, the edge of her black lace bra is just barely visible with the number of buttons she’s undone. Agatha very purposefully does not look.</p><p>She must be here with the suits, then. Part of the TGIF crowd blowing off steam after a long week.Agatha can tell by her eyes that she’s been here a while and has had a few drinks. Surely the alcohol should knock her somewhat off of her game, but Agatha knows better.</p><p>Rio is looking at her like a snake watching a mouse get dropped into its enclosure.</p><p>Agatha wishes she could run, could flee this bar and this town and this life. But she knows the game is afoot now, and walking away has never been an option. She thinks of the lawsuit and the apology sex in May and having to go to the support group alone, gathering her anger and honing it into a knife</p><p>“You look nice.” Rio’s opener is weak, so much so that Agatha wonders if there’s some new tactic she’s missing here.</p><p>Agatha knows that she <em> has </em> been eating more and going outside and even took the bathroom scissors to her split ends– knows she looks more like a woman and less like a ghost these days with her recently regained curves on full display in her barely-there dress.</p><p>But that’s not what this is about. She ignores the sentiment steadfastly and offers her first counter.</p><p>“Is this your thing now? Getting shitfaced with the people you have to pay to be around you?” Agatha jabs, aiming for destabilization. If anything, though, Rio’s predatory grin only widens, the red of her lipstick framing her white teeth in a bloody hue.</p><p>“It’s Peggy’s birthday,” Rio explains, her sweet voice so sincere it would fool a lesser woman. “The guys and I thought it would be nice to do a little something for her, since she’s done such a good job.”</p><p>Rio waits a beat, watches Agatha’s eyes shutter almost imperceptibly and knows she’s thinking about the coffee shop in February. How vulnerable she’d been.</p><p>“Most of the group has cleared out, but some of us have been playing drinking games.” Rio points to a stupidly large man with dirty blonde hair, leaning against the full booth and staring down at Peggy, dressed in yet another skirt suit. “That’s her husband, Steve.”</p><p>Agatha swirls her wine around in her glass, a portrait of indifference.</p><p>“This is the part where you share why you’re here, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha downs the rest of her wine, calling for the bartender to bring her a whiskey sour. Something that might dull the roar of her blood in her ears a bit better. To her right, Rio laughs at her.</p><p>Six months ago, Agatha would have told her exactly why she’d come here. Would have phrased it in the way she knew would draw the most blood and would have watched the crimson liquid spill from Rio’s veins with glee.</p><p>But six months ago, Agatha never would have been in this bar. And now that she’s just finally escaped the weird head space from the past month it feels wrong to say she’s hunting down a one night stand, something about it registering as a line she’s not ready to cross yet. She still has hopes of escaping this bar unscathed, of ending her night without bloodshed.</p><p>So Agatha lies.</p><p>She takes a sip of the cocktail the bartender deposits in front of her, relieved to find it’s mostly liquor. “I’m waiting for Wanda.”</p><p>“Wanda? You’re joking.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes dart over to the group of women she’d seen earlier and back to Rio, her resolve hardening.</p><p>“Yes, Wanda and no I’m not joking. This may come as a shock to you, but I have friends. And it’s girls night.”</p><p>Rio tilts her head, searching Agatha’s face for a moment before dropping her hand away from her chin and calling the bartender to bring her a beer.</p><p>“Okay, sure. You’re here waiting to have girls night with Wanda. I’ll wait with you,” she tosses her gaze from the bartender to Agatha, hoping to catch a glimpse of panic.</p><p>But Agatha doesn’t give it. If anything, she settles in. She’ll find a way out of this, surely. She just has to think of something.</p><p>Agatha’s drink is going quickly while they sit in silence. She starts to wonder if maybe Rio doesn’t know how to talk to her anymore. Wonders if maybe she’ll realize as much and feel awkward enough to walk away.</p><p>The thought twinges something in Agatha’s chest and she instinctively lifts a hand to rub it away. Rio’s eyes track the motion and she sits up straighter.</p><p>“Alice said you went to the support group a few weeks ago,” Rio prompts, suddenly casual. Agatha lifts her lip in the ghost of annoyance, the alcohol finally starting to take hold in her bloodstream.</p><p>“Yeah. She sent me the link weeks before you did, you know. You didn’t have to be a freak and go into my phone.”</p><p>Rio barks a laugh, light and surprised. Maybe shocked to have been caught.</p><p>“What the actual fuck are you talking about?” The words are harsh but mirth is still dancing in her eyes. Agatha’s brows pinch together.</p><p>“In May, when you came to the house. You disappeared and I’ve had you blocked for years but then you texted and–” Rio’s scoff is so loud it cuts her off. Agatha stabs her tongue into her cheek, debating the merits of throwing her drink in Rio’s face.</p><p>“That’s– I don’t even know your password, Agatha. I switched to an iPhone like a year ago. You still have my number blocked– which, fuck you, by the way– so I iMessaged you. It comes through the same way.”</p><p>Agatha feels a balloon begin to inflate in her chest, crowding her organs. Her fingers tighten around her glass.</p><p>“But your name was on it.”</p><p>Rio nods slowly, like Agatha is so stupid that it might qualify as a medical anomaly.</p><p>“Yes. That’s how an Apple ID works.”</p><p>“But the picture was the same?” Her voice is less an accusation now, more grasping for straws.</p><p>Rio’s cheeks darken and she looks down, picking at the label on her beer bottle.</p><p>“Yeah. I like that picture.” She shrugs.</p><p>Agatha remembers when she’d seen the photo on her phone screen again and recalled the feeling of being so in love that a half-blurry photo of someone rivals the Mona Lisa in your mind’s eye. She thinks it must be the same the other way around, then. When you’re so loved that you start to see yourself as a work of art too.</p><p>Old habits die loud and slow and violent and then turn into ghosts that will never leave you alone, or whatever they say.</p><p>Agatha looks away, picking up her glass to suck an ice cube onto her tongue, letting it turn the muscle numb as it melts and giving her slightly lagging brain a moment to think.</p><p>She remembers the anger she’d felt at what she thought Rio had done, the feeling of something cold and slimy taking hold in her chest and staying there. She considers the possibility that, maybe, she’s been assuming the worst and Rio is still just Rio, not some cruel stranger wearing her skin. Even if the sex had been some fucked up apology, it hadn’t been a vindictive scheme.</p><p>Maybe she’s gotten far better at pretending all of the good parts never happened than she ever thought she would– so much so that the lines of reality have gotten skewed along the way.</p><p>The balloon in her chest pops, taking all of the rage she's holding in her fists with it. She feels adrift without the baseline of a brawl to fall back on. Swallowing the remnants of ice on her tongue, Agatha turns back.</p><p>“Okay. Talk about something else.” Equal parts command and invitation. Not an apology but not a rejection, either. Rio nods, her blush gone and her face smoothed into something amicable.</p><p>“I did my deposition prep with Stephen on Monday. Sounds like it’s going to be pretty brutal.”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head so violently she suspects she may get whiplash before taking a large gulp and finishing her drink, signaling to the bartender for another.</p><p>“Not that.”</p><p>Rio holds up her hands in surrender before dropping them back to the bartop, leaning in and engulfing the safety that the stool between them had provided.</p><p>“Okay, Agatha. You wanna talk about why you’re wearing this slutty little ‘fuck me’ dress to, allegedly, get drinks with Wanda?”</p><p>Agatha sucks in a breath through her teeth, unable to fight the flush that rises to her cheeks and trails down her chest. The switch is so sudden that she almost loses her footing, but Agatha's better than that. She pivots, familiar with the cadence of their game even as her brain starts to get fuzzy and her body temperature starts to rise.</p><p>“What are you insinuating, Rio?” She asks, imbuing her voice with a veneer of false innocence. Rio doesn’t miss a beat.</p><p>“That from here, it looks like you’re sitting here alone in this bar on a Friday night with that desperate look in your eyes like you need to be bent over. You might as well be begging for it.”</p><p>Rio’s voice is low now, and every word goes straight to Agatha’s cunt. In return she drops her voice, leaning in so that her breath ghosts over the shell of Rio’s ear when she talks.</p><p>“But I’m not alone, am I? I’m with you.”</p><p>Agatha pulls back in time to watch Rio’s darkened eyes flicker down to her lips and back, her tongue subconsciously darting out to wet her own. Agatha needs that tongue elsewhere immediately.</p><p>Before Rio can open her mouth to respond, an obnoxious voice rings through the air, somehow audible even over the shitty music.</p><p>“Vidal, get over here! You’ve got the company card and we’re out of tequila!”</p><p>Agatha knows it’s Tony, Rio’s second in command. His father had practically been the king of their shareholders, enabling him to get more or less whatever he wanted. She watches the muscle in Rio’s jaw twitch, watches her take one last look at the expanse of leg left exposed in this dress.</p><p>“Wait here,” she says, plucking her beer from the bar and walking back to the booth.</p><p>Agatha watches her go, astounded and appalled by the audacity. She had hardly been able to stomach the fact that Rio was here, let alone been willing to talk. There’s no way in hell that she’s going to <em> wait here. </em></p><p>She takes another gulp of her already half empty drink, reaching for her clutch and readying to stand when she registers someone new walking over and perching on the stool that Rio had just left. Agatha pauses.</p><p>The woman is wearing a leather jacket and a confident smirk that says she’s used to getting what she wants. Her dark hair falls in thick curls, the ends dyed a deep, vibrant pink. Her focus is entirely on Agatha, giving her a slow once over.</p><p>“There’s no way that dipshit in the suit just walked away from the most beautiful woman in this bar,” she says with mock indignation, batting her eyelashes.</p><p>She’s flirting, obviously, and laying it on so thick that Agatha wonders if she’s somehow underestimated her own attractiveness. Agatha tilts her head, looking the woman over from head to toe.</p><p>She <em> is </em>beautiful. It’s undeniable. Agatha’s already miserably wet from her conversation with Rio and this is what she came here for anyway, right? This is what she wanted? <em>It is.</em></p><p>Agatha gets in character and tosses her hair over shoulder with a wink before putting on her best pout.</p><p>“You’re telling me, sweetheart. I guess I’ll just have to go home all by myself.”</p><p>The woman’s smirk deepens impossibly. She reaches out, tucking a rogue lock of Agatha’s hair behind her ear and trailing her touch along the line of her jaw.</p><p>“Well we can’t have that, can we?”</p><p>Agatha knows she has this woman hooked with her minimalistic performance. Even so, something about it lands wrong, twisting the tension in her gut away from desire and closer to nausea. Before she can pin the senasation down the woman’s expression shifts, her fingers pulling away from Agatha’s face with an unexpected quickness.</p><p>Agatha tries not to visibly sag with drunken relief when a strong palm wraps around her hip from behind like a brand, tugging her off of the barstool. She chooses not to read into that feeling.</p><p>“You’ll back the fuck up if you know what’s good for you,” Rio’s voice growls from somewhere behind her.</p><p>Agatha feels floaty, light and uninhibited but present enough to wonder if she’s dripping down her thighs. She resists the urge to check for a puddle left in her wake on the cheap pleather barstool. Jesus Christ.</p><p>The woman rolls her eyes but leaves, muttering something about freaky territorial dykes in this town.</p><p>Agatha barely notices Rio putting cash down on the bar for their drinks and pulling her outside and into a waiting Uber. She follows Rio into the backseat, dutifully buckling herself in and double checking that her clutch made it out with her. When everything is accounted for and the car starts to move, Agatha takes a deep breath.</p><p>She’s certainly drunk now, the part of her that wants to panic growing quieter and quieter, dwarfed by the enormity of her desire. Her pulse pounds in her core, and she crosses her legs tightly despite knowing it’ll only make her dress ride up further.</p><p>Slowly, she inches her hand across the middle seat until her nails find the fabric of Rio’s pants over her thigh. Agatha doesn’t turn her head, keeping her eyes on the passing scenery through the window as she begins to drag her fingertips from Rio’s knee to the top of her thigh and back down.</p><p>With each pass she creeps slightly inward, keeping her touch just shy of obscene. Rio’s breathing is harsh and loud, like she’s just run a marathon.</p><p>She readjusts her hand back to the center of Rio’s knee, repeating the cycle until finally the car slows to a stop at the edge of Agatha’s front lawn. Rio undoes both of their seatbelts and all but pushes Agatha out of the car, throwing a strained goodnight to their driver before following Agatha up to the front door.</p><p>Agatha’s movements are swift despite her inebriation, pulling the key from her clutch and getting them into the house in record time. As soon as she’s over the threshold her bag is pulled from her hand and her body is pushed into the cold wood of the front door, her head knocking slightly against the frosted glass pane.</p><p>Rio’s lips are on her in an instant and she can’t catch the deep, unrestrained moan that tears from her throat before it leaves her. Her body is a livewire beneath Rio’s touch, sparks firing off wherever her hands roam. They fist in her hair before sliding down her back and over her hips, peeling the shiny fabric of her dress up until it’s bunched just below her navel.</p><p>Agatha’s so lost in the clash of their mouths that she hardly registers the change, sucking Rio’s tongue into her mouth like she’ll die if she doesn’t. Her eyes shoot open in confusion when Rio pulls away, but Agatha watches as her gaze trails downward and a rumbling groan leaves Rio’s throat at what she finds.</p><p>Even in the dim lamplight of the foyer, Rio can see how wet Agatha is. Her once-red thong is now soaked a dark maroon nearly to the waistband and her pale thighs shine with evidence of her arousal. Agatha resists the urge to squeeze her thighs together at the sound.</p><p>Rio’s fingers on her hips tighten, hopefully leaving bruises in their wake. She looks back up to Agatha’s face, her own eyes nearly black with lust.</p><p>“I need to be inside of you.”</p><p>Agatha feels liquid heat pour down her spine and nods vigorously, pushing away from the door to tug Rio up to the bedroom.</p><p>When they finally make it up, Rio beelines straight for the nightstand on what was once her side of the bed, unbuttoning her shirt and tugging her slacks off on the way over. Agatha pauses to grip the door handle and take off her heels, tossing them by the dresser.</p><p>She watches with rapt attention as Rio opens the bottom drawer of her nightstand and pulls out her strap and harness. Agatha doesn’t try to hide the fact that she’s vibrating out of her skin, all of the lust she’s spent the past month beating back finally boiling down to this moment. She tugs off her own dress and steps out of it before crossing the room to where Rio is, left in nothing but her ruined thong.</p><p>Rio is finishing the process of tightening the leather harness around her hips and securing the green appendage in the O-ring, her calm exterior betrayed by her blown out pupils and her shaky breathing.</p><p>Agatha reaches out and pulls Rio in with a hand at the back of her neck, engaging her in a kiss that’s instantly deep and filthy. She slides her tongue behind Rio’s teeth and licks along the roof of her mouth, splitting her focus long enough to reach around and unclip Rio’s bra. When the straps fall from her shoulders Agatha pulls the garment free, tossing it blindly behind her.</p><p>Rio bites Agatha’s bottom lip and pulls, flicking her tongue over the hostage flesh. Agatha moans into the feeling. She steps back when Rio releases her, pushing down on her shoulders until she takes the hint and drops to the edge of the bed.</p><p>She spreads her legs lazily, leaning back on her hands to look up at Agatha with a cocky grin.</p><p>“You could have just called if you needed my dick this badly, you know,” she drawls. Agatha knows that she’s trying for cocky. Knows this, but can’t unhear the obvious note of genuine insecurity in her voice.</p><p>Agatha ignores it, giving her no verbal response and sinking to her knees on the plush rug so that she’s nestled between Rio’s open thighs. She reaches out, wrapping a hand sensually around the base of Rio’s cock and letting the other settle on Rio’s thigh to steady herself.</p><p>Agatha flits her eyes up, blue locking onto brown from beneath her lashes as she purses her lips and lets a wad of spit drop onto the tip and roll down the shaft.</p><p>One of Rio’s hands flies into Agatha’s hair like it belong there (it does) and her exhaled breath is a hissed <em> fuck</em>.</p><p>Agatha pumps the hand wrapped around the shaft a few times, spreading her spit over the appendage, before leaning down and flicking her tongue over the tip without breaking eye contact. She watches as Rio’s eyes roll back in her head and feels the fingers in her hair give a sharp tug.</p><p>She stays that way for a moment, running the tip of her tongue lightly along the underside of the shaft and parting her lips just enough to wrap around the head. She moans around the silicon and applies more pressure with her hand, her voice vibrating the strap at the same time that her hand presses the base into Rio’s clit. Rio’s hips jump, just like she wanted.</p><p>Agatha begins to work in earnest, taking more of Rio down her throat. She feels Rio’s other hand join the first in her hair, pulling her mane of waves away from her face.</p><p>She continues to grind the base against Rio’s clit, taking more of her in her mouth with each pass. When her nose finally presses into the skin above Rio's pubic bone, Agatha looks up to find Rio already watching her with drawn brows and her lip held painfully between her teeth.</p><p>When their eyes lock Rio gives a small, seemingly involuntary buck of her hips. Agatha gags with the motion, sinking her nails into the meat of Rio’s thigh and moaning loudly. She nods her head as best she can and Rio does it again.</p><p>And again and again, fucking herself into Agatha’s throat. Agatha can feel the tears slipping from her eyes and down her cheeks but she can’t look away from Rio’s face, too enraptured by the vision of her mounting pleasure. She can almost feel it building in her own body, like if she only focuses hard enough she can slip into Rio’s body, too.</p><p>With the liquor and lust working double time in her bloodstream, Agatha can almost pretend that they’re strangers– two people who met tonight at the bar and just happened to have insane sexual chemistry. They can almost be any two bodies coming together in an unspoken dance and not the tired choreography of a fight.</p><p>They can almost be Agatha and Rio, 25 and stumbling home to fuck like rabbits in their apartment after a night of dancing with their friends, young and beautiful and unshattered.</p><p>Rio’s breath catches on a whimper in the back of her throat and Agatha looks up in time to watch her back arch, her nails digging into Agatha’s scalp like a tether. Rio’s body stays frozen before she breaks, her orgasm rushing through her body.</p><p>Her hips continue to roll as she works through the aftershocks, pulsing her cock into the back of Agatha’s throat. The whole scene is so unbelievably hot that Agatha shifts her hips, rutting her clothed cunt against the heel of her own foot. The relief is immediate, but it’s nowhere near enough.</p><p>As if she can sense it, Rio gingerly pulls Agatha’s head back off of her, leaning down to place a wet kiss against her swollen lips before shuffling back to rest against the headboard, her legs stretched out in front of her and her hands resting on her abs.</p><p>“Come up here, pretty girl,” she coos. Agatha pushes up from the floor and climbs onto the bed, crawling to Rio before settling back on her knees.</p><p>“Take these off,” Rio instructs, snapping the waistband of her thong.</p><p>Agatha does so, reaching a hand out to hold the headboard and keep from falling. A string of slick stretches between her pussy and the fabric as she pulls it down before it snaps, and Rio releases a desperate, choked moan at the sight like she’s ready to cum again just from seeing it.</p><p><em> It wouldn’t be the first time</em>, Agatha thinks.</p><p>She throws a leg over Rio’s hips and places one hand at the juncture of her shoulder and throat, using the other to line herself up. Rio’s hands instinctively fall to their place at her hips, rubbing circles into the skin with her thumbs. Agatha wastes no time in lining herself up and sinking down, surprising even herself when Rio meets no resistance and bottoms out.</p><p>She closes her eyes and lifts her other hand to mirror its twin on Rio’s shoulder, breathing through the stretch and the overwhelming feeling of being so perfectly filled. Rio cranes her head forward, kissing at Agatha’s chest and throat while she adjusts. She runs her tongue over a nipple and Agatha’s back arches into the motion, her hips rolling slightly of their own accord.</p><p>As if being given permission by her own body, Agatha leans back and starts a slow rhythm. Rio’s hands stay obediently at her hips, but Agatha can see her eyelashes fluttering like it’s taking great effort to keep her hips still.</p><p>“You thought you were gonna bend me over baby, but you forgot this cock is mine. You want this just as much as I do,” she chastises, watching a blush rise to Rio’s cheeks and feeling her blunt nails press further into her skin.</p><p>Rio opens her mouth to respond, but Agatha chooses that moment to lift her hips and slam back down, beginning to ride her in earnest. Whatever retort was coming transforms into a whine, and Agatha can’t help but smirk at the clear win.</p><p>The victory is short lived, her pleasure winning out over any games she could play. Agatha shifts forward slightly until the head of Rio’s cock drags perfectly against that spot inside of her with every thrust, picking up speed to propel her building orgasm.</p><p>One of Rio’s hands lifts from her hips to palm her breast, her fingers pinching around the nipple. The moan Agatha releases is profane, joining the slick sounds of the symphony they’re conducting. After a particularly forceful drop down, she lets her sweaty forehead drop down to rest against Rio’s hairline.</p><p>“You’re so– <em> ah– </em> you’re so deep I can feel you in my fucking throat,” she whines, feeling the coil beginning to tighten inside of her, moments away from snapping.</p><p>Rio’s eyes flash and her hand lifts from Agatha’s breast to circle her throat, squeezing with her thumb and middle two fingers.</p><p>“Yeah? Here?”</p><p>All Agatha can do is nod and moan, the floaty feeling in her head sending a pulse to her clit. All of her senses are heightened by the alcohol and how unbelievably turned on she is, and for once Agatha is all of the way out of her head and in her body.</p><p>There are no thoughts spared to the implications of all of this, no concerns about how she’ll feel tomorrow that can reach her. There are only Rio’s hand at her throat and Rio’s fingers moving to swipe at her clit and Rio’s cock inside of her. She moves her own hands from Rio’s shoulders to her tits, grabbing roughly as she explodes into her orgasm.</p><p>Agatha feels her cunt squeeze so tightly around Rio that she’s locked inside, the white hot pressure of her orgasm traveling outward and burning up to her ears and down to her toes. It’s perfect, and for a moment she wonders if she’s actually blacked out.</p><p>But before she can fully regain her senses, Rio flips them, pressing Agatha’s face down into the mattress and pulling her hips into the air without ever disconnecting them.</p><p>All that Agatha can do is moan at a volume closer to a scream, gripping the sheets below her for dear life. Rio pounds into her, one hand splayed wide on Agatha’s back while the fingers of the other rub messy circles against her clit.</p><p>“Seems like <em> you </em> forgot that this pussy is mine, too. So I’m going to use you how I want to and maybe that’ll help jog your memory.”</p><p>The words alone tip Agatha into another orgasm, sharper but no less strong than the first. She sobs into the sheets beneath her, every nerve ending alight.</p><p>But Rio doesn’t stop, fucking her into overstimulation until finally her rhythm falters and she lets her weight fall against Agatha’s back, gasping a moan directly into her ear.</p><p>Seconds or hours later, Rio pulls slowly out of her and falls limp at Agatha’s side, still breathing heavily. She can hear the soft clink of the harness straps pulling loose, but her heavy eyelids fall shut of their own accord and she’s asleep before any other thoughts can find her.</p><p>When Agatha wakes, there’s a moment where she can’t place her surroundings or the flood of urgency that begins to fill her. She blinks repeatedly, finding the red glow of her bedside clock and seeing that it reads 4:30, the world still pitch black.</p><p>The bed is shifting next to her, she realizes, the covers thrashing and frantic breathing reaching her at last. When a frightened whimper hits her ears, her long-dormant maternal instincts come to life and she acts on muscle memory. She reaches out, finding a warm body and dragging it close, shaking it slightly.</p><p>“Rio,” she tries. No response comes.</p><p>“Rio,” more urgently, “wake up.”</p><p>Her eyes fly open, wide and terrified even in the dark of the moonlit bedroom.</p><p>Agatha’s concern is so overwhelming that she doesn’t stop to think about the fact that Rio is still here. That they had the sex that they did and had fallen asleep together after and that Rio is <em> still here</em>.</p><p>Rio’s eyes find her face at last and her arms shoot out, clinging to Agatha’s shoulders for dear life. Rio burrows her face into the skin of Agatha's throat. Agatha can feel her hot tears at her clavicle, can feel how every breath she takes is too shallow to be getting any real air to her lungs.</p><p>Agatha keeps her hold around Rio, pressing a palm between her shoulder blades and taking deep, slow breaths like she used to when Nicky had meltdowns as a toddler.</p><p>After several long minutes Rio calms down enough to match her breathing, and Agatha would think she’d fallen asleep if it wasn’t for the occasional sniffle. She can count on one hand the number of times she’s seen Rio like this. it’s unnerving.</p><p>“It’s always the same,” Rio whispers into the dark, so quiet that Agatha almost misses it.</p><p>“It's Death. It comes for my parents first and then for Nicky, and I can’t make it stop. The more that I scream, the more it laughs. And when I think it’s finally over, it comes for you.” Her voice breaks, and she takes another ragged breath.</p><p>“And I can’t– I can never make it in time before it drags you into the ground, too. No matter how fast I dig, I can never reach you.” She’s still hiccuping between words, her breath catching on a sob.</p><p>“You’re the only person left that I love that isn’t dead.”</p><p>The hairline fractures between the pieces of Agatha’s paper mache heart tear into gaping fissures. She runs her nails along Rio’s scalp on autopilot, twirling soft hair around her fingers in the way that has always soothed her. She lets the warm tears continue to fall against her chest before finally pulling Rio more tightly against her, ignoring her use of love in the present tense and the serrated dagger that it plunges through her gut.</p><p>“I’m right here,” she whispers, because what else is there to say? Her raspy voice catches on the words and she tries again, more firm.</p><p>“I’m right here.”</p><p>It feels like lying to Rio earlier at the bar, but worse. It feels like a nightmare and a daydream intertwined, the universe itself  feeling unsure if Agatha deserves to be comforted or punished and settling for both.</p><p>Eventually, Rio’s breathing evens out once more, her tears drying into Agatha’s skin. They fall back asleep that way– Rio’s full weight on her chest, curled in like she’s trying to crawl behind Agatha’s ribs even in her sleep.</p><p>When Agatha wakes again to full sunlight, her first thought is that she didn’t have a single dream, bad or otherwise.</p><p>The second is that she’s alone in the bed, with her t-shirt drawer slightly ajar and the harness and strap discarded on the floor. So much for pretending to be strangers, or whatever <em> just two bodies </em> bullshit she was drunkenly peddling herself. She should know better than to think that the cold, unforgiving jaws of reality would leave her alone for even a single night.</p><p>Agatha sets her hand on the pillow next to her, cool to the touch. The bile that rises to her throat tastes like whiskey and regret.</p><p>This feels far worse than a one night stand would have, she decides.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>After two full days of silence and isolation, Agatha succumbs to the simple truth that if she spends one more moment alone with her racing thoughts she’ll crack clean in half.</p><p>Since she woke up to an empty bed on Saturday, shame, guilt, rage, and regret have beaten incessantly against the walls of her skull like a drum. Longing, sharp and loud like a long-festering hunger, tried to muscle its way in every now and again. Agatha swallowed it forcefully back down each time, clenching her teeth lest it crawl up her throat again.</p><p>When her salvation comes at last, it is not without stipulations.</p><p>Agatha parks her car at the neighborhood pool, sparing a fleeting thought to her sanity and adjusting her sunglasses in the rearview mirror. Wanda had sent her a text suggesting she’d benefit from an extra set of eyes on the twins at the pool since Vision had to work, and Agatha had been ready to do just about anything that would give her an out.</p><p>Never mind that going to the pool meant setting herself directly in the sights of everyone she’s been actively avoiding for three years. Agatha’s not above calling in a bomb threat if Ralph Boner takes it upon himself to make small talk.</p><p>Despite shelling out a small fortune for her HOA fees each year, she hasn’t been here in a long time, annoyed at the mere thought of the screaming kids and the chemical smell and the blistering heat of the sun. Nonetheless, she grabs her pool bag from the passenger seat and adjusts the knot of her purple sarong around her waist before stepping out of the vehicle and walking up to the pool gate.</p><p>The place isn’t as crowded as she had feared, only a handful of families milling about the tables and loungers. The teenage lifeguard perched on the other end of the concrete doesn’t even look up when the gate clangs shut behind her, sweeping his gaze lazily over the water instead.</p><p>Agatha catches movement out of the corner of her eye and turns, finding Wanda waving at her from a set of loungers tucked mostly beneath the shade of the pool house awning. She forgoes a return wave but crosses over to join her all the same, setting her bag down and pulling out a towel to drape over the chair.</p><p>“Thanks for leaving your lair to join us. It makes me nervous when they outnumber me,” Wanda greets, tucking a finger into the book in her hands to mark her page.</p><p>Agatha only grunts in acknowledgement, dropping her sarong and settling onto her lounger. She pulls at the top of her black one piece bathing suit, adjusting the strapless garment so that it covers more of her chest. Family friendly environment and all that.</p><p>Wanda seems to accept her silence, looking out to where the twins are playing in the shallow end with a few other boys and watching them for a moment. When she’s content with their safety, Wanda lays back down, her scarlet hair fanning around her head and her face scrunching in concentration as she lifts the novel in her hand and resumes her reading.</p><p>Agatha shifts on her lounger, thankful that the majority of her body is under the shade. Despite her hangover being long gone, she still feels like she got hit by a truck. Her muscles are sore and her gut twists with turmoil-induced nausea. Her mind keeps drifting back to Friday night, regret curling in her chest that it happened at all and a film of guilt for feeling that way settling over it.</p><p>Agatha can feel when Wanda’s focus slides to her, her eyes tracking Agatha’s unease. Before she can say anything, a shadow falls across Agatha’s sun-exposed legs.</p><p>“Well aren’t you just a sight for sore eyes!” Sharon’s squeaky, overeager voice reaches her ears. Agatha feels her left eye twitch in response.</p><p>“Hello, Sharon.”</p><p>Sharon hovers near her feet with the largest sunhat in the history of man, the ribbon around its brim matching the gaudy pink of her floral tankini and swim skirt.</p><p>“I feel like we haven’t seen you in forever! It’s so nice that you’re getting out and about again. You know, they say sunshine and fresh air can really cure just about anything.”</p><p>Agatha pushes down the groan that she feels building in her throat. A glance to her side shows Wanda biting back a grin, the corners of her mouth curling upward.</p><p>“What have you been up to, dear? What’s got you so busy?”</p><p>“Ritual sacrifices and acts of vigilante justice,” Agatha deadpans while holding Sharon’s eyes, hoping to end this conversation. Sharon merely throws her head back in exaggerated laughter, placing one hand on her hip and wagging a finger at Agatha with the other.</p><p>“You’ve always been such a funny one. You really need to get back to book club, it certainly hasn’t been the same without you.” She turns. “And you too, Wanda. The girls have been asking about you!” She admonishes.</p><p>The girls in question being, of course, Sharon’s group of wine-addled friends in their 60’s that have always cooed at Agatha and Wanda like they were teenagers and not women in their mid to late 30’s.</p><p>“Wish I could, Sharon, but I’m afraid I don’t know how to read,” Agatha tries again, starting to wonder if this conversation would also be a good enough reason to make her bomb threat.</p><p>Sharon turns her focus back to Agatha, a warm smile on her lips and glee in her eyes. “You really are a hoot, Agatha.” Sharon bends slightly, placing an awkward pat on Agatha’s shin.</p><p>“I’ll leave you girls to it, but remember that we’re all here for you if you need us! The neighborhood sticks together,” Sharon chimes as she pulls away, her eyes wide and her face serious.</p><p><em> ‘Here if you need us’ my ass </em>Agatha thinks, gritting her teeth as Sharon trots away.</p><p>Silence falls between them again, but Agatha can feel Wanda’s eyes back on the side of her face. She feels the desperate need to unzip her skin to make room for the additional emotions that Sharon has left in her wake, longing for the time when all of it could be condensed into a single-minded anger.</p><p>She waits for the sensation to pass, for her composure to return, but it seems unwilling to come.</p><p>Wanda waits too, patient and serene. Distantly, Agatha hears the splashes and squeals of a cannonball competition. So much for pushing all of it down and hoping it goes away on its own.</p><p>Quietly, without removing her sunglasses or meeting Wanda’s eyes, Agatha starts with the explanation that feels most apt.</p><p>“I slept with Rio,” she murmurs.</p><p>“You never stopped sleeping with Rio.”</p><p>Agatha jerks her head to the side at the words. She must make some sound of surprise, because Wanda honest to god giggles.</p><p>“I’ve seen her car in the driveway and then you randomly have these big ass hickies like you got into a fight with a vampire. I’m sorry to say you haven’t been very subtle.”</p><p>The shock of being called out so bluntly dulls some of the churning in her gut.</p><p>“Ok. Sure, we sleep together from time to time. But this was.. different, I guess.”</p><p>“Different how?”</p><p>“Like it wasn’t supposed to happen. I was horny, I went out to find someone to fuck, and she was there too. It was just sort of a drunken thing.”</p><p>Almost as an afterthought, Agatha adds, “and then she stayed over.”</p><p>“Does she not usually stay over?” Wanda lifts an eyebrow, like this is the only piece of information to have surprised her thus far. Agatha gives a dismissive shake of her head.</p><p>“No, that’s not how this goes. We fight, we fuck, she goes home. It’s straightforward. This was, I don’t know, more intimate? And then she was gone in the morning. I obviously haven’t heard from her but things feel weirder, somehow.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t want to bring up Rio’s nightmare or the moment they’d had. She won’t share that Rio said she loves her, already pushing that little tidbit somewhere inside of her that the light can’t reach.</p><p>Wanda skips over the new and horrific discovery about the way they’ve been interacting since their separation, only having speculated before, and instead continues determinedly on her path.</p><p>“Did you want her to still be there in the morning?”</p><p><em> Yes. No. </em>Agatha deflects.</p><p>“I knew exactly what to expect when things were how they used to be. I feel like I have no control over anything anymore. This whole thing feels like a big <em> fuck you </em> from the universe.”</p><p>Her throat tightens with frustration, both with the situation and with Wanda’s pestering. Whether or not she wanted Rio to stay isn’t the point– the point is that she needs to figure out how to get back to safer, more detached territory. How to undo Friday night. Wanda, clearly coming to a different conclusion, rolls her eyes.</p><p>“Nobody can control every aspect of their life, Agatha. Sometimes we just have to roll with the punches.” She meets Agatha’s eyes, lifting her brows as if to convey that she’s being serious. “The both of you need to get it together and have a real conversation.”</p><p>Agatha wants to snap back at Wanda for being preachy, but her attention snags.</p><p>“The both of us?”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes slowly latch back onto her book, her limbs tensing with awkwardness even as she feigns nonchalance.</p><p>“Well, yeah. I see Rio pretty often in the warmer months. The boys are student volunteers in the memorial garden,” she explains, pretending to read the pages before her and studiously ignoring Agatha’s burning stare.</p><p>Of course she knows about the memorial garden. Rio had funded its inception at the elementary school the spring after Nicky’s death, planting flowers and trees and shrubs and working with the kids and teachers to maintain them every year since.</p><p>Agatha had been only once, slipping through the small wooden gate that bore a hand painted sign reading <em> Nicky’s Garden. </em>She walked along the colorful tile path and ran her fingers over sleek leaves, pausing to sit on a bench surrounded by saplings that will one day be voluminous willows. It was breathtaking, and Agatha could feel herself siphoning the life out of it with every step. She’s never gone back.</p><p>The feeling of betrayal that colors her reception of Wanda’s admission is bitter on her tongue, mostly because Agatha doesn’t want to feel it. It’s an old feeling, rooted somewhere inside of her where the spoiled parts go to rot, not be dragged back up.</p><p>It’s not that she owns Wanda, and it’s not that she really <em> wanted </em> her neighbors to have rallied around her like Sharon suggested. It was that they had rallied around Rio. That of all the people Wanda could be spending her time with it has to be Agatha’s ex-wife.</p><p>In her mind’s eye, Agatha imagines the two of them laughing between rows of sunflowers, sharing in some joke that she’ll never be privy to. Agatha takes the image and superimposes it over Rio’s reaction Friday night when she had said she was waiting for Wanda at the bar, and the feeling of exclusion doubles.</p><p>She breathes through her nose, looking out at the gaggle of children splashing in the water while she gathers her thoughts. Agatha tries– she really does– to take a second and remember how she’d felt when she found out Rio hadn’t actually fucked with her phone. Tries to remember that Rio is clever and she can be cruel, but that she isn’t vindictive. Tries to picture her as a human and not a ghost.</p><p>What surfaces instead is the awkward strain that had inundated their attempt at conversation, that unexpected gap of silence. That, and the way she had cracked Agatha open in the night only to slip out before dawn, leaving Agatha to flounder while she gets to return to business as usual.</p><p>The two swirl together, forming into a single thought: she and Rio are nowhere near on the same page anymore. They haven’t been in a long time, and she’d do well to remember that.</p><p>Agatha moves her focus back to Wanda, who still hasn’t turned the page of her book. The same old feeling lingers, taking up more space rather than disappearing after her attempts to rationalize it away. </p><p>Suddenly it’s three years ago again and Agatha is stuck in the knowledge that everyone around her knows how to handle themselves and their emotions normally, and she’s still the pity project that they’re dragging along out of some twisted sense of obligation.</p><p>How quickly she had gone from being Agatha Harkness-Vidal to simply Rio’s Mad Wife– one of them a grieving mother and the other a monster haunting her steps.</p><p>Well, one thing’s for damn sure. She won’t spend the day letting Wanda treat her like some small, broken thing as a tribute to her friendship to Rio. Agatha gathers her bag and stands, whisking her towel off of the lounger.</p><p>“I wish I could say this was nice, Red, but I have to head out. Work thing.”</p><p>Wanda sits up, setting her book face down on her lounger and looking up with regret-filled eyes.</p><p>“Agatha wait–”</p><p>“I’m sure I’ll see you around, what with you being in my fucking business and all. Don’t let your kids drown.”</p><p>With that Agatha turns on her heel and leaves, making the quick drive back to the house and hurrying to get inside. Her prison walls, so safe. So familiar.</p><p>She inhales deeply, feels the chill of the air conditioning press against her sweat damp and sunscreen sticky skin before walking through the house to hang her towel out on the back deck. Comfortable once more in the familiar ache of her solitude, she meanders to the kitchen and begins to assemble a peanut butter sandwich.</p><p>Agatha falters for a moment with the knife in her hand and the bread in the toaster, realizing the motion is more a habit than a true craving. Every pool day has come with a round of peanut butter sandwiches, usually held in still soggy hands and devoured by giggling mouths on the front porch.</p><p>Her phone begins to buzz where she left it on the counter and Agatha drifts across the kitchen, lifting it to her ear without looking and expecting the mechanical voice of a spam call.</p><p>“Harkness.”</p><p>“Ms. Harkness, hello, it’s Stephen Strange.”</p><p>His voice is pitched strangely high, and she can almost imagine him tugging at the collar of his shirt. Of course, it’s fucking Stephen calling about the lawsuit. Because all of the walls have to be closing in on her at once. Nothing about this life can ever just be awful in half measures.</p><p>“Stephen. To what do I owe the pleasure?” She makes no effort to hide the agitation in her words. Stephen seems too wound up to notice.</p><p>“Did you and Rio never actually get divorced?”</p><p>Agatha hesitates, the question catching her off guard.</p><p>“Well, legally, no. That’s a lot of money, Stephen,” she chastises mockingly. Over the line she can hear his incredulous laugh, followed by a whispered <em> oh my god </em> and the rapid clicking of fingers on a keyboard.</p><p>“Agatha,” his voice is strained, like it’s physically paining him not to scream at her, “the whole point of you and Rio’s involvement in the case is to help show the damage that the clinic has done to fam– people’s lives! I’ve been using your divorce in our opening argument, we didn’t even begin to cover this in your deposition prep–”</p><p>“Actually, Stephen,” she cuts him off, unimpressed and exhausted, “we’re part of the lawsuit because our son is dead. And if memory serves me– and it does– <em> you </em> told us that it was fine if our story was shaky because we’re not part of your primary argument anyway. Sounds like you’re the one who made an oopsie.”</p><p>Across the line, Stephen makes a mangled sort of sound. Agatha ignores him. She registers the <em> ding! </em> of her toast popping up behind her and makes a play to wrap this conversation up before it grows cold.</p><p>“You’re a smart boy, I’m sure you can find a way to work around this. Think of it as a fun little challenge.”</p><p>He sighs, forlorn. “Why couldn’t you just make it official on paper? You two hate each other anyway.”</p><p>Stephen inhales an obnoxious breath like he can suck the words back in, the noise crackling over the line and scratching sharply against Agatha’s eardrum. The silence that follows is oppressive.</p><p>Holding her cracked phone to her ear in her sun drenched kitchen, still in her bathing suit and with a butter knife clutched in her free hand, Agatha wonders how she can explain to this man the way that separating from the love of one’s life is painful enough without adding extra steps.</p><p>If she should tell him that when the front door slammed shut behind Rio and Agatha knew that she wasn’t coming back, it was more damning than any fucking government document could ever be. Or that it doesn’t matter if they’re legally bound or not because their souls were knotted together on the day that they met and they’ll stay that way until the day that they die.</p><p>She opens her mouth, ready to tell him that he’s more than welcome to cleave her in two and root around to sort out the parts that want to hate Rio from the parts that want to hold her, though she’s certain he’ll find that they’ve blended together to form an indistinguishable slop trying to pass itself off as a whole woman. Ready to say that maybe it looks like hate to him right now but all of this was love, once.</p><p>Agatha shuts her mouth again, suddenly very aware that she doesn’t want to say anything even remotely close to that to Stephen Strange. To herself, either. She hangs up.</p><p>Assembling her sandwich and eating at the counter in silence, Agatha reaches back in her mind for that old feeling of numbness she used to be able to call forth at will. She tries, fruitlessly, to pluck herself free from this body and this life and float along with the other dust moats in the shaft of sunlight hitting her tile floors. Reminds herself that all of this will end some day only to find that it doesn’t sooth her like it used to.</p><p>When the sandwich is gone and she sweeps the crumbs into the trash, Agatha decides to approach things from a different angle. She throws on shorts and a tank top, grabbing a book from her nightstand that she’s been trying to make herself read and getting back into her car.</p><p>Nobody else is at the cemetery when she arrives, which doesn’t come as a surprise. It’s a sweltering Monday afternoon, not quite prime ‘visiting the dead’ hours.</p><p>“Hi baby.” She presses her palm flat to the ground by his headstone.</p><p>Agatha takes up residence in the grass by the foot of Nicky’s grave, sitting perpendicular to make the same L shape that they used to on the couch for movie nights or when he would play video games while she worked on her laptop.</p><p>It’s nice even with the heat, the beads of sweat rolling down the notches of her spine not enough to detract from the calm of being with her son in the only way that she can anymore. The book she’s reading isn’t necessarily good, but it’s enough to keep her mind occupied.</p><p>When a person-shaped shadow falls across her lap and blocks out the sun, Agatha gets a rather unfortunate sense of déjà vu. She looks up, shielding her eyes with her forearm. Above her looms Alice, wearing a tank top and cargo shorts.</p><p>“Hey, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha stares up at her quizzically instead of responding before looking around, wondering if Stephen put out some sort of hit on her for the whole divorce conversation. Maybe he sent Alice to admonish her on his behalf.</p><p>But Alice merely shoves her fists into the pockets of her shorts, rocking back on her heels.</p><p>“I didn’t mean to interrupt– my mom’s a few rows up and I saw you on my way out. Figured I’d say hi.” She shrugs, inclining her head to the marble slab. “Is this your son?”</p><p>Agatha is relieved that Alice seems to have no ulterior motive in striking up the conversation, but watching her read his headstone makes Agatha feel suddenly exposed. Her pulse picks up in her chest, but she nods anyway.</p><p>“Yeah, this is Nicky.”</p><p>Alice gives a soft smile. “Hey, Nicky. I’m Alice. I know your mom, sort of.”</p><p>Agatha realizes she’s staring when Alice meets her eyes and forces out an awkward laugh, pulling a hand from her pocket to rub at the back of her neck.</p><p>“Sorry if that was weird, I always talk out loud to my mom. I like to think that they can hear us, you know?”</p><p>Agatha clears her throat, turning to face his headstone if only to break their eye contact. “It wasn’t weird. I do it too.”</p><p>A beat passes. Agatha decides to be gracious and fill the silence.</p><p>“Where’s Jen?”</p><p>A flicker of something unreadable crosses Alice’s face. “Lorna’s doing this day camp for a few weeks. We were worried about her having an episode while she’s there, so Jen decided to be a volunteer chaperone to be nearby.”</p><p>The premise of Alice’s statement is somber. Agatha knows this. Still, she snorts an uncontrollable laugh. At Alice’s confused look, she explains through her laughter, “I actually cannot imagine Jen tolerating a child other than her own.”</p><p>Alice does smile at that, her amusement tinged with shyness but still full.</p><p>“Me neither. So far she’s had to come home every day and sit in the bath for an hour in total silence.” Her smile widens. “I think I caught her screaming into the water last night.”</p><p>Agatha laughs, loud and real at the image. </p><p>“I just hope she survives it, because there’s no way in hell I’m doing that deposition by myself next week,” Alice says, shaking her head at the thought.</p><p>It makes sense that Alice and Jen’s date would be so far before their own, but still. Agatha feels the slightest twinge of stress on Alice’s behalf. They instigated the lawsuit for a reason, she remembers. Alice knows what she’s doing.</p><p>“Well I better head back to work, I was just popping over on my lunch break,” Alice explains, taking a shuffle step backwards.</p><p>“It was good to see you, Agatha,” she shifts her eyes to Nicky’s headstone and back, that small smile never leaving her face. “He’s lucky to have a mom like you.”</p><p>With that she offers one last wave and leaves, tracing a path back to her car. Agatha grips the book in her hands tightly, feels the unexpected yet significant rush of tension leaving her body.</p><p>It’s being recognized as a mother in the present tense, it’s being able to laugh at the absurdity to be found in something difficult, it’s the relief of having a single conversation today that didn’t feel like it was make or break.</p><p>It’s all of it, touching on the same old wound that Wanda unknowingly had at the pool earlier but now with a gentler hand, smoothing the old fracture back over. Agatha returns to her book, feeling lighter than before.</p><p>Later, when she gets back in the car, Agatha shoots Wanda a text about maybe going for a walk some time soon. It’s not an apology, but Wanda responds with a little red heart all the same.</p>

<p>The following Thursday is eaten up by an hours-long team meeting, wherein Agatha begins to seriously contemplate the merits of figuring out how to fall asleep with her eyes open.</p><p>Is it really possible that the financial report alone can take an hour and a half? Or that considering a slight change in the HEX codes for their company colors needs to be deliberated so seriously? Agatha thinks the answer to both should be a resounding <em> no</em>.</p><p>When Lilia lifts her reading glasses from her face and sets them on her desk around 2:30, Agatha is sure her sigh of relief is echoed by every other attendee. Sadly, she’s the only one with her mic on.</p><p>Lilia shoots a glare in her general direction, though the distance of the video call really takes some of the sting out of the gesture. She turns her focus back to the screen at large and flashes a grin.</p><p>“Thank you all for your time today, I think we’ve given ourselves a fantastic roadmap for the next few months.” She’s already closing the laptop in front of her, but pauses before dismissing them all.</p><p>“As I’m sure you’ve all seen in your inbox, I’m having my fiftieth birthday party this weekend,” Lilia plays coy.</p><p>Lilia has not been 50 in, more or less, 13 years. Agatha considers pointing this out, but decides to leave it be. Let the old bat have her fun.</p><p>“I know we’re all pretty spread out, but you’re all more than invited and if you have the means to make it, I would love to see you there. It’s not going to be anything fancy, just a dinner party here at my house. None of that cake and singing nonsense. Please feel free to bring a plus one!”</p><p>Her eyes are alight, and despite her words Agatha can almost see the Great Gatsby-esque fantasy playing out behind her eyes. Some of her coworkers unmute to confirm that they’ll be there while others share deep, excessive apologies for having to miss the event. Agatha stays silent, already very certain her Saturday night will entail a good cocktail and a true crime documentary consumed on her couch in a cocoon of blankets.</p><p>Her phone buzzes on her desk, and she’s surprised to see a notification from Lilia.</p><p><b>Lilia: </b> <em> Everyone means you too, Harkness. You’ll be there or I’ll make you start attending meetings in person. </em></p><p>Agatha’s eyes flash incredulously between her phone and her computer screen where Lilia is bidding them all a good afternoon, tossing Agatha a wink when they’re the last two on the call before leaving. When the actual fuck did she even have time to type that out? Witch.</p><p>Looks like she’s headed to Boston on Saturday.</p><hr/><p>Saturday afternoon comes sooner than she’d like, and Agatha stands in her foyer in a black halter neck maxi dress, nice enough that she can’t be accused of being underdressed but comfortable enough that it won’t piss her off as the night wears on.</p><p>She adjusts her lipstick and runs her fingers through her unruly hair in the mirror above the shoe rack while she waits for her ride. Agatha will go to the party, sure, but she draws the line at driving herself. There’s no chance in hell she’s going to endure this evening sober.</p><p>A honk sounds from outside and she grabs her keys, pulling the front door open and stepping out. She pauses when her eyes adjust to the light, finding the pastel yellow VW Beetle waiting in her driveway in all of its obnoxious glory. Beggars can’t be choosers, she supposes.</p><p>It was by sheer luck that she remembered one of her coworkers lives only one town over– Helen or Alena or something– and that said coworker had agreed to pick her up on the way up to Boston. Agatha remembers her as being a young thing, but her ability to do covert opposition research on their clients’ competitors is matched only by her older sister, who Agatha had worked with at <em> Divination </em> for a handful of years.</p><p>She and Natasha hadn’t spoken much, but Agatha had always respected the bone-deep fear that she inspired in men. It had been a bit of a bummer when she’d left to work in actual spy or defense shit or whatever overseas, but she’d recommended Lilia hire her sister in her stead.</p><p>Agatha had spoken to the girl maybe three or four times, but she seemed fine enough. Good enough at her job that Agatha doesn’t really need to think about her much, which is how she likes it.</p><p>Agatha locks the door behind her and heads out to the car, bracing herself for whatever sort of headache this drive is sure to bring her. But the girl doesn’t make small talk beyond a simple hello once the door shuts behind Agatha, pulling back out of the neighborhood and making for the highway.</p><p>She does, however, sing loudly and off-key to a god awful playlist with a mix of Chappell Roan, dramatic 80’s ballads, and folk music in a language Agatha couldn’t even begin to guess. Agatha considers opening her door and throwing herself out of the car at about the one hour mark, but ultimately decides it’s not worth it on the off chance she survives.</p><p>Halfway through the trip she glances to the dash, seeing the bluetooth connection labeled <em> Yelena’s iPhone</em>. Okay, so not Helen or Alena. She’d been close, though.</p><p>When finally Yelena slows the car to a stop just down the street from Lilia’s place, Agatha finds she’s nowhere near as tense as she figured she’d be by now. In fact, she feels a bit giddy when her watch reads 5:00 and she realizes it’s the perfect time to start in on Lilia’s fancy ass liquor.</p><p>She waits politely for Yelena to join her from the other side of the car so that they can make the short walk together, mentally patting herself on the back for being so gracious.</p><p>Lilia’s brownstone is beautiful and every bit as stupidly expensive as it appears from the outside. The crawling ivy up the face of the bricks and the half-drawn curtains in the window are all perfectly arranged to give the illusion of someone who doesn’t care much for decorating, but Agatha knows better.</p><p>The house rests on a quiet street with similarly ornate and overpriced homes, though still not too far from the heart of the city. Agatha ascends the front steps and reaches for the brass doorknob without knocking, swinging the door open and stepping through like she owns the place. Somewhat sheepishly, Yelena trails in after her.</p><p>Many of the guests have yet to arrive but a healthy amount of people are still milling about Lilia’s home, floating between the dining room, kitchen, and living room. The whole place drips in gem tones and small but impactful details that scream comfort. Her furniture is an eclectic mix of modern and antique, blending together so seamlessly that it all seems like a curated collection when viewed as a whole.</p><p>But Agatha’s been here too many times to be impressed by any of it anymore, instead making a beeline for the expansive drink cart that Lilia keeps in the formal dining room. She plucks a glass from the shelf and scans each of the bottles, wanting to be sure to indulge in only the best of what Lilia has to offer. Agatha didn’t come to Boston to drink the low brow shit.</p><p>Her fingers are halfway to a bottle when she hears a low, amused voice just to her right.</p><p>“Glad to see you have your priorities straight, Agatha,” the voice drawls.</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, knowing who it is before she ever looks. It’s Hela, Divination’s CFO. The deliverer of Thursday’s notoriously unbearable financial report and a somewhat friend of several years. Or an amicable coworker, at least.</p><p>Agatha flicks her wrist towards Hela, ready to wave her off while she finishes the very important task of making a drink selection, but catches another figure standing on Hela’s other side.</p><p>She’s wearing a matching brown vest and dress pants, her hands tucked casually into her pockets. A single gold chain hangs around her throat and her hair is down for once, falling in waves across her shoulders.</p><p>“Why are you here?” Agatha asks, quick and sharp. She didn’t quite mean to say that out loud, but she does want to know the answer. Rio’s expression hardens instantly, like her anger had just been waiting for Agatha to provoke it. Her hands pull free from her pockets to cross over her chest.</p><p>“Because I was invited, Agatha. In case you forgot, Lilia was the godmother of my child. She gave you away at our wedding–”</p><p>“As a bit–”</p><p>“Did you think she was going to drop me like you did? Did you think just because you tried to cut me out of your life that I stopped existing in everyone else’s?”</p><p>Clearly, Rio had intended for the words to come across as cutting, sharp in the way that Agatha’s had been. But when they clearly register as sincere, she clenches her jaw, rolling her shoulders back.</p><p>“You know what? I’m not doing this with you tonight.” She turns to Hela, acting as though Agatha isn’t there at all. “I’ll find you later.”</p><p>Rio turns and disappears in the direction of the living room, her body thrumming with a tension that feels palpable to Agatha. She watches her go, stunned into silence.</p><p>Hela lets out a low whistle, looking to where Rio had disappeared before turning back to Agatha with wide, amused eyes.</p><p>“Yikes! You really know how to woo a woman, Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha bares her teeth in a sneer but it falls on Hela’s retreating back, losing any potential impact. Now alone, she settles into the sudden emotional whiplash from the interaction.</p><p>Their hook up after the bar, the looming deadline of the deposition, the way she’d been a bitch to Wanda and hasn’t seen her since, the notifications in the support group chat from people who have already done their depositions weighing her phone down in her pocket like lead. And now this– Rio’s outburst and subsequent dismissal. All of it builds in her throat, suffocating her with every breath.</p><p>And why is Rio choosing now to be angry? <em> She’s </em>the one the left Agatha the other night, that had freaked and then disappeared. She had instigated going home together. If things had gone Agatha’s way, they wouldn’t have interacted that night at all. </p><p>Agatha finishes pouring herself a drink amidst her mounting frustration. Of course she’d prepared herself for boring socialization with employees she barely knows and a lengthy car ride with a near stranger, but not for this. When she ever has been or ever will be prepared to be around Rio, Agatha doesn’t know.</p><p>She takes a sip, drifting aimlessly into the kitchen. She finds Lilia there, leaning against her mammoth kitchen island while she talks to a set of people Agatha’s sure she’s never met. Her frustration latches on to this new target, ready to be offloaded.</p><p>“Why did you invite her?” She asks Lilia, her tone clearly displeased.</p><p>Lilia shoots her an exasperated glance before smiling apologetically towards her guests, pushing off of the island.</p><p>“Excuse me one moment, would you?” Her voice is syrupy sweet, though Agatha can feel her annoyance through the hand that grips her upper arm and drags her out of the kitchen, down the hall, and into Lilia’s study. When the door clicks shut behind them, Lilia pins her with a look that Agatha long ago dubbed her Disappointed Parent Face.</p><p>“Have you no manners at all?” She asks, almost pleading.</p><p>“Why is she <em> here </em> Lilia? You know we can’t be around each other.”</p><p>“You’re a grown woman and you’re already seeing one another just fine with all of this lawsuit business. And it’s my birthday Agatha, for crying out loud! You’ll be fine.” At Agatha’s crestfallen expression she reaches out, patting her consolingly on the shoulder.</p><p>“You know that I care for the both of you very much. She’s family just as much as you are. You can make it through one night.” Lilia gives her a soft smile before pulling the door open and disappearing back out into the hall, leaving Agatha alone in the study.</p><p>She huffs out a deep sigh, digging the toe of her sandal into Lilia’s plush rug. <em> Why does everyone keep throwing around the F word? Jesus. </em></p><p>But she does find it in herself to be a little remorseful, maybe. A bit chastised. Surely, she can be good for one night, can play nice and act normal and give Rio the space she so obviously needs.</p><p>Agatha finishes her drink in one gulp for courage and leaves the study, planning to get a refill and then enact her master plan. Fate, of course, has other plans. </p><p>Rio stands alone at the bar cart, not pulling from any of Lilia’s classy offerings but instead rummaging around in the cooler next to it, filled with various beer cans and seltzers. Agatha hovers awkwardly in the archway, not sure what to do with her body.</p><p>Rio looks over her shoulder at the shuffling sound, sees that it’s her, and turns her head back to her task without a word. Agatha grimaces, deciding to add one small extra step to her plan before committing to the whole space thing.</p><p>She steps forward carefully, positioning herself at the far end of the cart from Rio and assembling her drink in silence for a second while she draws up her courage.</p><p>“I didn’t mean it like that. I just–” she pauses, trying not to look like she’s scanning the side of Rio’s face for any minute reaction. There isn't one, anyway. “I thought it was a work thing. I wasn’t expecting you, is all.”</p><p>Satisfied with her effort, Agatha lifts her glass and prepares to walk away. Rio turns though, looking her fully in the face. Her eyes remain unreadable, like trying to catch a reflection in a swift moving river. Agatha stills beneath her gaze.</p><p>“I know,” she says, turning back to the cooler and finally making a selection. It’s not an absolution but it’s not a condemnation, either. Just an acknowledgement, left to hang in the air between them.</p><p>Agatha nods even though she isn’t watching, walking to the living room before she can upset this tentative peace somehow.</p><p>For the next several hours, Agatha plays happy party guest. She sips her drink, slow and demure, and snacks on the various hors d'oeuvres that sit on pretty little trays throughout the kitchen and living room. She winds her way in and out of conversations with coworkers and strangers alike, enduring Hela’s ribbing and an increasingly tipsy Yelena’s ramblings about her girlfriend.</p><p>She listens as Lilia tells a crowd of onlookers some absurd tale about one of their first clients and laughs at all of the right parts, even though she’s heard variations of it a thousand times and lived through the entire ordeal herself.</p><p>All the while, as though they have a mind of their own, Agatha finds her eyes tracking Rio. The slope of her throat as she throws her head back to laugh, the tilt of her head when she’s listening to something interesting, the raising of an eyebrow that some idiot can’t tell means she’s making fun of him.</p><p>The glass in Agatha’s hand sweats against her palm, beads of moisture sliding down the curve of her wrist. Maybe, if she were to analyze such things, she could admit the possibility that she had never given Rio any indication that she would be welcome to stay through to the morning. That, if anything, she had perhaps been projecting the opposite sentiment only hours before.</p><p>That feeling settles in the hollow of her throat again– something like a quiet remorse. A creeping thought that she may have been wrong, even if only slightly.</p><p>Her thoughts are pulled back to the conversation she’s been pretending to take part in for the past 20 minutes, the group of people that she allegedly supervises breaking out in raucous laughter. She lets a small smile paint her face, hoping she looks engaged enough to not be off-putting but not so engaged that someone actually tries to talk to her. A fine line to walk.</p><p>A bright eyed blonde leans into their circle conspiritorially, and Agatha marvels at how childlike she looks. Had she been like that in her early 20s?</p><p>“Does anyone know who the hot, mean looking brunette is with Hela?” The blonde questions the group, her voice low as she focuses her eyes somewhere back past Agatha’s shoulder. “And if she’s single?”</p><p>Her counterparts devolve into a fit of giggles, surely aided by the alcohol, but Agatha feels her stomach drop. She doesn’t have to look to know what hot, mean looking brunette is. Would be embarrassed to be caught staring like the rest of her group is doing now.</p><p>She takes it as her cue to be absolutely anywhere else, to release herself from this performance for at least a few minutes, and slips out of the back door and into the garden.</p><p>Evening has long since become night, and the garden is lit only by the open windows of Lilia’s brownstones and the ambient glow of the city lights. It’s a small space, but Lilia has somehow managed to fit in seemingly hundreds of plants and a small fountain so laden with moss and stones that it looks like a miniature pond.</p><p>It feels like Lilia found a lush forest and picked it up, shoving it into the confines of her fenced in yard. Agatha steps out, letting vines and leaves brush her hands and legs as she makes her way to a small stone bench.</p><p>She takes a seat and looks up, inhaling her first clear breath in hours. The city lights blow out any chance of seeing the stars here, but it’s kind of nice. Boston always reminds Agatha of her 20s and that youthful sense of invincibility that buoyed her– finally free from her mother’s house and not yet tainted by further tragedy. Everything was possible then.</p><p>She drops her head, turning her face back toward the house. Agatha watches the party through the brownstone’s large windows, the warm glow of the lamplight illuminating the guests and their talking mouths. She can’t hear their words from here, but the music from Lilia’s record player filters out through the cracked doors and floats across the air, imbuing the garden with a feeling of something intimate for Agatha alone to experience.</p><p>Agatha embraced that she was one half of a pair of magnets long ago, so she’s not surprised when her eyes find Rio, laughing with Lilia and Hela in the kitchen. She looks so light, so safe here. Agatha rubs absently at her arm with her free hand, thinking about how tense Rio had been when they’d spoken at the beginning of the party.</p><p>The longer she’s been away from Agatha, the more relaxed she seems. Less fearful. Less angry. Agatha swallows around the lump that forms in her throat, reminds herself that this observation isn’t something new.</p><p>Of course, the universally recognized truth about magnets is that they work both ways.</p><p>For a moment, Rio’s eyes find her through the glass and hold her stare across the darkness. The openness in her expression doesn’t fade, though. It lingers. Agatha feels the world narrowing, like there’s something about this moment that is supposed to matter a great deal. But it feels like they’re Jane Goodall and Washoe the chimp, getting close to something like meaningful communication but inevitably falling short.</p><p>When Rio looks away, mouth opening to respond to whatever Hela had said, Agatha can breathe again. She turns her head fully away from the house and looks back up to where the stars should be. She hopes that somewhere, in another timeline maybe, they got something better than this. Something less jagged. </p><p>In this timeline, Agatha sinks into the quiet solitude of the night. She returns to the party once she’s met her minimum threshold for silence, finding that the majority of the guests have already gone. She places her empty glass in the kitchen sink and wanders into the living room, finding Lilia gathering empty silver trays and Yelena curled into a ball on the couch.</p><p>Agatha furrows her brow, walking over to the girl and shaking her shoulder lightly.</p><p>“Yelena,” she says like a question. “What are you doing? It’s time to go.”</p><p>Yelena moans something entirely incoherent, curling in on herself further. Agatha groans, burying her fingers in her hair and turning to an amused Lilia.</p><p>“What am I supposed to do? I don’t want to drive her weird little car or drag her drunk ass back home. What if she throws up?” Agatha pleads. She remembers something else, her expression growing somehow more pitiful. “I don’t even know her address, Lilia!”</p><p>Lilia rolls her eyes at the theatrics, moving to pick up another tray.</p><p>“She can just sleep right there on the couch, it’s no trouble for me. And you can stay in the guest room tonight.”</p><p>Agatha groans again, louder this time. Yelena mumbles something that could almost sound like <em> ‘stooloudimtryinsleep </em> before burying her face between the cushions. Agatha points at her dramatically, looking to Lilia like <em> are you seeing this? </em></p><p>Lilia doesn’t bother responding, walking her handful of empty dishes back to the kitchen.</p><p>It’s not that staying over would be the absolute worst thing in the world, but the mattress in the guest bedroom is undeniably uncomfortable, and Agatha’s pretty sure the room is haunted. At least at home she knows all of the ghosts.</p><p>“I could drive you back,” a voice behind her offers. Agatha closes her eyes at the sound, counting to three in her head before turning around to meet Rio’s eyes.</p><p>One hand is back in her pocket while the other swings her keys around, her hair tucked behind one ear to reveal a medley of piercings.</p><p>“I’m about to head out anyway,” Rio shrugs.</p><p>Agatha weighs the options before her– a night in Lilia’s spooky, uncomfortable guest room or an hour and a half in the car with her ex-wife. She watches the keys swing around and around in the air while Rio waits for her response.</p><p>She’s not sure why Rio would offer, especially when she’d been so upset before. Agatha thinks of the two of them trapped in the car and wonders if it would be worse if they sat in silence or if she was forced into a conversation without any chance of escape. All of the alarms in her head are going off at once.</p><p>“Well?” Lilia says from the kitchen doorway, watching Agatha with one brow raised. Agatha looks up from the swinging keys and catches Rio’s eyes, holding them for a beat.</p><p>Fucking magnets. She nods.</p><p>Rio makes a sweeping gesture with her arm, and the two head for the front door.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio’s keys jangle in her hand as she takes Lilia’s front steps two at a time and leads them down to where she’d parked on the next street over, her steps casual and loose like this is something normal for them to be doing together.</p><p>Agatha checks her wristwatch once she’s cleared the steps, taking in the quiet of the city and musing that it must be later than she had initially thought. When she realizes it’s already past 11:30, she pushes down another groan. It’ll be nearly one in the morning by the time they make it back to the house. She’s too old for this shit. For every part of tonight, really.</p><p>The Subaru comes into view, Rio clicking the remote so that the headlights flare to life. Agatha tries not to flinch at the sudden onslaught of light.</p><p>“You know, this car is so old that she could legally get a license of her own.”</p><p>Agatha lifts her eyebrows and turns to look at Rio, surprised by the seemingly benign comment. The lengths she's going to to make this something meaningless. Agatha decides to play along.</p><p>“Well if she’s getting human milestones then you missed her quinceñera,” she finds herself responding as they near the vehicle, rounding the front to pull open the passenger side door. It’s all nonsense, the two of them speaking for the sake of filling the silent night air– none of this has to mean anything.</p><p>It always does, though.</p><p>Agatha wonders if she’s going to have to pull small talk like this out of her ass for the entire drive, but things settle back into silence once they’re in the car and settled into their seats. There’s only the steady hum of the engine as Rio turns the keys in the ignition, the soft clicking of the turn signal as she navigates back out of the city.</p><p>With Rio, there’s never a GPS. Or Bluetooth or an AUX cord for her phone or even a goddamn paper map. Just the compass in her brain that never seems to stray and a gut instinct that she’s always sworn would get them where they needed to go. Agatha had stopped questioning the possibility of getting lost a long time ago, but the peculiarity has never lost its novelty.</p><p>Rio gets them out of the city and onto the highway, the flat road stretching out endlessly behind and ahead of them in the dark. She reaches out a finger and presses play on the dashboard’s crusty CD player and it whirs to life, the discs shifting unseen before the first track starts.</p><p>The moment that it does, Agatha feels her chest tighten, propping an elbow on the car door to support her head while she stares at nothing in particular through her window. This is a mix she knows, one she’d watched Rio burn onto a disc in college.</p><p>She can almost remember waking up on a warm Sunday morning in their first apartment, cocooned in the duvet and thoroughly pleased with how her first summer post-grad was shaping up. So far she’d been working at Lilia’s company for a few weeks, and everything felt like it was hers for the taking. Even the city felt new despite the four years she’d already spent there.</p><p>The cold of the bed beside her wasn’t quite alarming, but it was enough of a disturbance that she had cracked an eye open to take stock of the room. The windows had all been flung open and the breeze sent the curtains billowing lazily in the air.</p><p>From across the tiny apartment she could hear Rio’s unmistakable voice singing quietly along to Billy Joel’s <em> Vienna</em>, carrying down the hall and through the open doorway. Agatha had groaned as she stretched, cat-like and indulgent, and Rio appeared as though she’d been waiting for the sound.</p><p>“Good morning, gorgeous,” Rio chirped with a grin, waving the duster in her hand in greeting. She was wearing the same shorts and tank top that she’d gone to sleep in, but she’d added a stupid little black apron covered in cartoon skulls overtop. “Thoughts on pancakes?”</p><p>Agatha shifts in the passenger seat, trying not to get too lost in the memory and yet unable to keep herself from remembering the feeling of looking at Rio that morning and feeling the burning weight of the ring in her nightstand, just waiting for a good enough time to ask her to marry her and terrified that she would say no. She tosses a glance to Rio’s hands on the steering wheel and wonders where that ring is now.</p><p>The playlist carries on through the fuzzy speakers, both soothing and taunting in its familiarity. The first notes of <em> Landslide </em>play and Agatha sees from the corner of her eye as Rio hums quietly along, her right hand dropping away from the wheel and shifting over like it’s going to settle on Agatha’s thigh like it used to.</p><p>Instead the hand stops halfway through the air, resting jerkily on the gear shift. Agatha releases a quiet exhale through her nose. How much of each of their lives is now just muscle memory, she wonders? An old habit that they can’t seem to kick?</p><p>How much of this is a choice anymore?</p><p>Agatha lets her eyes fall shut, leaning back against the headrest. Stevie Nicks’ voice croons through the car, winding it’s way around her ears.</p><p>
<em> Well I’ve been afraid of changing, ‘cause I built my life around you </em>
</p><p>She squeezes her eyes tighter, like maybe she can block out not only light but sound, too. Agatha is just on the right side of loose from the alcohol for her usual steel wall of resolve to become something closer to a paper sheet, leaving her feeling far too vulnerable. Sitting in their car, listening to one of their CDs, driving back to their house.</p><p>Everything smells like Rio and feels like home, and something forms an iron grip around her ribcage at the notion and squeezes.</p><p>As though the same feeling has somehow traveled to her body from Agatha’s, Rio asks “are we going to talk about it?”</p><p>Her voice is barely audible over the combination of the music and the buzz of tires on asphalt, but the words reach Agatha as if they’ve been screamed through a bullhorn. And Agatha knows what she’s asking, what she means. How in one open, vulnerable moment they had molded back to one another without hesitation.</p><p>She doesn’t want to have this fight. She wants to sweep it under the rug, along with everything else that they’ve let pile up there. Wants to leave it alone so that the scar tissue can properly reform, but</p><p>“Which part?” She asks. Tired and resigned to her fate as a captive of this car ride.</p><p>Rio seems to think on it, like she really only gets to pick one part and wants to choose wisely.</p><p>“Were you really going to go home with someone else?”</p><p>The question takes Agatha by surprise. It’s not what she thought would have Rio so wound up, of all things. And it probably isn’t. More likely it was just the first thing that came to mind.</p><p>But Agatha thinks back to the bar and the one scan she’d done upon arrival. She thinks of the woman with the pink hair and the arrogant smirk touching her face and the bad feeling it had left in her gut. Agatha shakes her head even though Rio isn’t looking.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>She almost leaves it at that, but something about the two of them sitting side by side and watching the road ahead feels like the booth of a confessional– an echo born of a childhood spent in the Catholic church.</p><p>“No, I’m ruined for anyone else.”</p><p>Agatha wants it to come out like a dig, but the words fall flat and heavy. She waits for Rio to push or maybe confirm that she’s not sleeping with anyone else either, but she does neither. Rio is silent for the time that it takes to flick her turn signal and switch lanes, speaking when the rhythmic clicking fades away.</p><p>“Okay. Your turn to ask something,” she prompts.</p><p>It’s unexpected and unfamiliar– not a finger digging into a bruise but a seemingly full retreat. Agatha feels unmoored, glancing down at her own hands in her lap. She’s already exposed, isn’t she?</p><p>“When you came to the house in May, was it just an apology?”</p><p>Blood heats her cheeks as the words leave her, but the question has been lingering in the pit of her stomach even after Rio said she hadn’t fucked with her phone. She knows that behind her bravado, Rio can hear what she’s really asking. <em> Do you even still want me? Is this how we quantify things now? What’s real and what’s not? </em></p><p>Rio clears her throat, rolling her neck like the question is making her tense. Her brow furrows, though she keeps her eyes firmly on the road. Agatha finds, with a certain level of intrigue, that she’s scared to hear the answer.</p><p>“No,” she breathes at last. “I’d had a rough day. And I wanted– I didn’t want to be alone. I thought it would help get my mind off of things.”</p><p>She shrugs, like this is nothing. Like she isn’t confessing to something as awful as feeling like things were bad enough that she needed Agatha and knowing that the only way she could have her was physically. And Agatha remembers that she hadn’t been kind– she’d been hard and harsh and taking.</p><p>“Apologizing after was just something that was on my mind and it just sort of came out. I guess I didn’t realize it came off that way.” She sighs, running her fingertips along the seam of the leather steering wheel. “And then you reacted like that and I was embarrassed. I left as soon as you went into the bathroom.”</p><p>Agatha stares at the side of her face and feels the knowledge sink in. All of it is so fucked up, isn’t it? That Agatha had thought Rio had come over to pity fuck her as an excuse to break into her phone and then heard her freak out in the bathroom and ignored it. That Rio had needed comfort and thought that the only thing close would be Agatha’s unforgiving hands. That she’d come home for those hands anyway.</p><p>That their once beautiful tether is now this snarled, mangled nest.</p><p>The fragile scab that’s been holding together the open wound of Agatha’s heart tears clean off. She’s hemorrhaging, the blood is everywhere– in her throat and on her hands and filling the car. They’re both up to their teeth in it.</p><p>If she had just been different– could just be someone different, someone softer– maybe this wouldn’t all be so agonizing. But it is. She is.</p><p>“Do you think we were always going to end up like this?” Agatha asks after a beat, swallowing around the thickness in her throat. The very first acknowledgement of the game that they play.</p><p>Even though she knows it’s not her turn to ask a question, this one has been rolling around in her skull for years, now marble-smooth from all of her prodding. Who else can she ask if not Rio? For her part, Rio doesn’t look hurt in the corner of Agatha’s eye. Just contemplative.</p><p>The quiet between them stretches along the highway. The CD skips slightly as it switches songs, and Agatha knows exactly where the scratch on the disc is that causes it. Rio’s hand lifts from the gear shift and wraps feather light around Agatha’s forearm, sliding down until her fingers gently cradle her wrist and her thumb rests over her pulse.</p><p>“Maybe I would if I thought that when things get hard it means it’s the end. But if I let myself believe that then I wouldn’t have made it to adulthood. I don’t think either of us would have.”</p><p>And it’s steady, it’s sure. It’s just like Rio to cut straight to Agatha’s core and unravel her from the inside out. Agatha lets Rio’s touch on her arm stay, soft and warm, leaning into it ever so slightly like a sunflower seeking light. She tries to find it in herself to pull away and comes up empty handed.</p><p>She lets the tears pool at her lashline like she could fight them if she tried, watching the tail lights ahead of them blur into red gashes against the inky black night. When her cheeks turn damp as they fall, she pretends she doesn’t feel it.</p><p>“I’m so tired, Rio.”</p><p>Agatha hardly recognizes her own voice, so small and without a single protective barrier left. But it's true. All of it is exhausting- her rage and her pain and the fondness for Rio that never goes away. The aching loneliness that dogs her every step. She wants to take back this show of weakness but finds that she can't.</p><p>The hand around her wrist gives a faint squeeze, shifting until their fingers are interlocked and resting on Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>“I know, baby.”</p><p>It’s all that she says. All that she needs to say. There is no game, no ploy. Nothing bloodthirsty between them rearing its ugly head. Just a bit of something honest, taking a piece of Agatha with it as it goes. Just a lapse in judgment that she can blame on the alcohol tomorrow, a brief reprieve from holding the only support system that she's ever had to her knife. Their hands stay intertwined for the rest of the drive.</p><p>By the time Rio pulls the car into the driveway, Agatha has pulled herself back together. There are no traces of tears on her cheeks, no tremble to her jaw. Just a tiredness that clings to her skin and the nagging feeling that this car ride has taken years off of her life. Rio withdraws her hand slowly and without a word, watching as Agatha unbuckles her seatbelt and opens the door. Only when she’s all of the way out of the car and about to close the door behind her does Rio call out.</p><p>“Agatha,” she says, “next time, call me and I’ll come. Meeting at the bar was too expensive.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t laugh at the attempted humor, seeing the truth in Rio’s wide, nervous eyes instead. She hesitates for half a second, her hand still gripping the car door. None of her internal defenses come to her aid.</p><p>“And if you– if it’s bad again, you can be here. If you need that.” She falters. “We don’t have to do anything.”</p><p>It feels like a dangerous thing to offer even as it leaves her– the opening of a door she’s kept very securely and intentionally shut. But Rio’s eyes shimmer as she nods back, her bottom lip pulled between her teeth.</p><p>“Bye,” she says with an awkward wave, catching Rio’s returned <em> te veo </em> as she shuts the door and makes her way up to the house.</p><p>Agatha traces the mindless path from the front door up to her bedroom, letting her feet carry her straight to the back of the closet on Rio’s all but empty side. She pulls out the purple cardigan from where she’d set it all the way back in April, still neatly folded.</p><p>She lifts it to her nose and takes a deep inhale. It smells just as much like Rio as it did when she gave it back. Agatha drags her dress up over her head with little ceremony, leaving it in a heap on the closet floor and buttoning the cardigan over her bare skin.</p><p>She walks back out of the closet to rummage through Rio’s dresser drawers, pulling out a pair of ratty old sleep shorts and sliding them up her legs. Climbing onto the usually empty half of her bed, Agatha burrows herself beneath the covers like she can block the whole world out this way.</p><p>She falls asleep wondering,<em> if this isn’t the end, then what is? </em></p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>July is slowly, slowly melting its way into August. It is so fucking hot in Massachusetts. Agatha tries to trace every life decision that has led her here, sprawled on the floor of her bedroom in front of her oscillating fan.</p><p>Her phone vibrates from a foot away, the sound muffled by the rug. She knows it’s probably Alice, looking to confirm that they’re still on for lunch later. Agatha doesn’t reach for it, content to remain utterly still so as to not get any sweatier than she already is.</p><p>She doesn’t know why she said yes when Alice had reached out to invite her to lunch with her and Jen.</p><p>Well, that’s not entirely true.</p><p>Agatha had woken up the morning after Lilia’s party determined to chock the whole car ride with Rio up to a drunken disaster, except she very much so had not been drunk. Neither had Rio, obviously. And instead of burying itself when Agatha pushed at it, the memory seemed to pop up more often out of spite. The brush of Rio’s thumb over her pulse while she’s washing her face. Their eyes locking through the kitchen window when Wanda goes on a tangent about some reality show she’s watching. The steady timbre of Rio’s voice calling her baby when she’s trying to fall asleep.</p><p>So when Alice’s text came through a few days later, the distraction seemed like it could be nice. Helpful, even. Maybe Agatha could remind her body of its anxiety over her upcoming deposition by asking how theirs went and then the adrenaline surge would make it impossible for her to think about anything else. Or so she can hope.</p><p>At long last she rises, forcing herself into a tank top and a pair of linen shorts, pairing the ensemble with an old, worn in pair of sandals before bracing herself and heading out the door. Agatha lives in a northern state for a reason, thank you very much. She’s supposed to be safe from heat waves and humidity levels over 75%.</p><p>When Agatha pulls up to the cafe downtown that they’d agreed to meet in she finds that it’s much nicer than when she’d last stopped in years before. Swirling vines weave up and over a trellis that serves as an awning of sorts over the front door, a simple hand-printed open sign swaying in the window. She trudges across the parking lot and pushes through the door, the crisp blast of the air conditioning a balm to her sweat-damp skin.</p><p>Alice and Jen aren’t hard to spot, already stationed at a round table nearly in the center of the small dining area. Agatha’s surprised to see Lorna with them, though she realizes she shouldn’t be. When she waves off the hostess and makes her way to the table, it’s Lorna who looks up to greet her first. Her wedge of the table is already overrun with sheets of blank paper and a small pack of crayons merely awaiting her idle hands.</p><p>“Hi.” She squints at Agatha, almost assessing. “You were at the gym. But you didn’t come back.”</p><p>Agatha squints at her right back, ignoring the way Alice and Jen have pulled away from whatever conversation they were having to watch.</p><p>“Very astute, aren’t you?”</p><p>Lorna’s face scrunches up at Agatha and she can almost hear the little gears in her brain whirring to life as she tries to figure out whether this foreign word is a compliment or a dig. It ultimately doesn’t matter either way when Jen pulls a pair of headphones with little cat ears out of her purse connected to a purple iPod, the likes of which Agatha’s sure she hasn’t seen since the early aughts.</p><p>Lorna lights up at the sight, taking the offerings from her mother and securing the headphones squarely over her ears, dwarfing her tiny head. Immediately she seems to forget all about Agatha, settling in to color with pinched brows, her head bobbing slightly to her music. Agatha finds herself momentarily charmed by the single-minded focus that kids can have, part of the world one second and somewhere else entirely the next.</p><p>She snaps herself from her reverie, pivoting to give a pointed look between Jen and the iPod as she sits in the chair between Alice and Lorna. Jen huffs, rolling her eyes.</p><p>“I am <em> not </em> raising an iPad baby. That’s like the only thing left without a screen.”</p><p>Agatha shrugs, making a face like <em> if you say so </em> before Alice can cut in, clearly trying to steer them all away from any tension.</p><p>“It’s good to see you, Agatha. Have you been here before? The Witches’ Road is one of our favorites.”</p><p>She respects Alice’s attempt, really. Even lets herself play along for a second.</p><p>“Yeah, but not in a long time. Last time I was here I’m pretty sure it was still legal to smoke inside and the kitchen staff was taking full advantage.”</p><p>Jen barks a cough into her fist that sounds an awful lot like <em> old </em> and Agatha turns away from Alice, narrowing her eyes. “And how was summer camp, Jen? Make any friends? Braid anyone’s hair while you talked about boys?” Agatha props her chin on her fist, batting her lashes.</p><p>Jen’s right eye twitches, like she’s having World War II-esque flashbacks to being around so many children. “I liked you better when you were having a panic attack. At least then you were quiet.”</p><p>Alice gives a nervous little chuckle, glancing between the two of them. “Do you guys already know what you want to order? It’s such a big menu, so hard to decide.”</p><p>Agatha keeps her eyes on Jen, finding the smirk on her face turning into something closer to genuine. She likes the feeling of the volley, the way that Jen doesn’t so much as flinch when Agatha flashes her claws. And based on the mischief dancing in her eyes through her feigned disgust, Jen doesn’t seem to mind either.</p><p>A waitress comes by shortly after and takes their order and the atmosphere shifts into something quieter, more like what Agatha had expected this lunch would be. She lets Alice tell some long-winded story about her job as a mall cop for a while, even asking questions when called for before she starts to feel that itch beneath her skin.</p><p>They’re not friends really, the three of them. They’re only…what, co-plaintiffs? Acquaintances via a legal proceeding? Whatever they are, Agatha doesn’t believe that the two of them invited her here to talk about work and the weather. She shifts in her seat, throwing her hair over her chair to keep it off of her back before cutting Alice off mid-sentence.</p><p>“So, do you two woo all of the other plaintiffs before their depositions, or is this your weird roundabout way of hunting for a third? Because I’m flattered ladies, really, but I don’t think you could keep up with me.”</p><p>She tosses in a wink for good measure, but her discomfort at feeling like she’s in the dark and her anxiety around talking about the deposition make the joke fall flat.</p><p>Alice visibly grimaces. Rude. Jen shoots an incredulous glance between Agatha and Lorna, who remains entirely oblivious as she reaches to switch colors.</p><p>“Damn, Harkness,” Jen says, clearly amused. “You must really be bent out of shape about this if that’s the best you can do.”</p><p>Agatha only rolls her eyes, but Alice shoots her a sympathetic look anyway. Really, what is it with this woman and all of her empathy? It seems exhausting.</p><p>Alice pauses for a second like she’s deliberating before finally opening her mouth, her tone much softer than Jen’s had been. “Have you gotten the chance to talk to Rio at all about the deposition stuff? Stephen said you guys were doing your prep separately and I know your date is coming up pretty soon.”</p><p>She feels an awkward grimace cross her face before she can push it back, quickly schooling her face back to neutrality. Rio had tried, maybe, to talk to her about it at the bar. But then they had very much not talked about it. They hadn’t talked very much at all after that, actually. Agatha taps the ends of her nails against her jaw, pretending to think it over.</p><p>Is Stephen even allowed to tell them her business like that? Is there not some sort of lawyer version of HIPAA? And more importantly, can they not just talk about the non-Rio parts of the deposition? It’s daunting enough as is.</p><p>The waitress, god bless her, chooses that moment to bring their food out. Agatha takes advantage of the pause to game plan how to deflect, picking up her fork and stabbing it into her salad once the plates have all been left on the table and the waitress is gone again.</p><p>“Did Stephen tell you anything else? Because last I heard from him he was pretty pissed that we’re not legally divorced. Said it really fucked up his argument.”</p><p>She shovels an overlarge bite into her mouth when she’s done, watching Jen’s lack of acknowledgement while she cuts Lorna’s chicken tenders into little pieces and Alice’s brief but wide-eyed shock. Alice is quick to pull herself back together, Agatha will give her that. She shrugs one shoulder and picks up a fry from her plate, taking a bite before gesturing with the half still between her fingers.</p><p>“I wouldn’t worry about it, honestly. Stephen is good at his job and I’m sure it won’t actually matter in the long run. He was probably just stressed– the people Perlman got for this are ruthless.”</p><p>When Agatha glances over again, Jen is watching her with an unwavering sort of focus that makes her feel exposed despite Alice’s placating words, like Jen can see straight through her. Agatha shifts her eyes back down to the salad she’s maiming, deciding how to best get the focus back off of herself.</p><p>“Sounds like a doozy then if it’s got him that wound up. How did your deposition go?” She shovels in another bite.</p><p>Alice and Jen both seem to seize up at the question. It’s not the same sort of tense that Jen had been after remembering Lorna’s summer camp but something deeper, something that looks like it hurts to remember. Her stomach flips uneasily. When she swallows, it feels like rocks in her throat.</p><p>Alice’s arm moves, like she’s squeezing Jen’s leg under the table. She clearly tries to offer Agatha what’s supposed to be a reassuring smile, but all of her teeth are bared.</p><p>“Our case is definitely strong,” she starts, her eyes darting to her daughter of their own volition before she meets Agatha’s gaze again. “And Stephen kept them on their back foot most of the time. But they were really coming for our throats.”</p><p>Alice’s voice is quiet, like if she talks about it any louder it would make it more real. Agatha sees that fire from the first time they met flickering behind her pupils, something white hot and vicious pulled to the surface by the memory. Beside her, the muscle of Jen’s jaw flexes, her emotion quieter but no less visible.</p><p>“They were playing cards I didn’t even know a person could pull,” she adds. “I can respect dirty, underhanded moves when they’re done well, but they were way too bold with that shit. I think I would have killed them if this didn’t matter so much.”</p><p>Jen says it like it’s not an exaggeration, only a fact.</p><p>Agatha shudders slightly before she can help it, feeling worse off for having asked. She can’t even begin to wonder what the fuck the two of them mean, trying to wrestle her brain to the floor before it can race ahead and draw some horrifying conclusion about how her own deposition will go.</p><p>Her stomach clenches violently, and Agatha feels glad she at least got in a few bites before her appetite fled. She pushes the salad away, tapping out a steady rhythm with her fingers on the table in the now empty space.</p><p>Alice’s eyes track the movement, her expression softening.</p><p>“But I’m sure they went so hard on us since we’re the primary plaintiffs. I doubt they’ll push everyone like that.”</p><p>Agatha tries and fails to give some sort of show of polite gratitude, the corners of her lips twitching up before falling back down just as quickly. Alice doesn’t seem to mind, though. When she speaks again, Agatha can tell that she’s being intentionally gentle. It makes her ever simmering rage rise to a slow boil.</p><p>“If you’re not comfortable doing the deposition with Rio, I’m sure Stephen could sway them to let you guys do it–”</p><p>“<em>No</em>.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice rises from her chest and passes through her lips without her permission, the word coming out loud and fast. Her eyes widen as Alice falls quiet, but she doesn’t take it back.</p><p>The only thing that could possibly be worse than doing the deposition with Rio would be to do it without her.</p><p>Jen catches her eye again, staring her down with that same intense look. This time something similar seems to cross Alice’s face and the alarm bells start ringing somewhere distantly in Agatha’s mind. This conversation is clearly about to veer somewhere she won’t be able to pull it back from.</p><p>It’s Lorna’s voice that rings out next, startling them all from their three way staring contest and saving Agatha from what was bound to become an interrogation.</p><p>“I like Miss Rio,” she says sagely.</p><p>Her big headphones rest around her neck, clearly having come off at some point when Agatha wasn’t paying attention. Lorna’s brown eyes are big and owlish, sparkling as they lock onto Agatha’s with the same focus she’d devoted to her coloring.</p><p>“She taught me how to bounce a basketball.”</p><p>Alice and Jen look like they’re watching a car crash in slow motion, bracing for something horrific to happen. Jen grips her fork tightly in her fist, like she’s made her peace with the fact that she may have to use it to fight Agatha off of her small child. To their credit, Agatha knows that while they’ve been humoring her today, they’ve seen the monster that she is. They have every right to be afraid of her.</p><p>But it’s almost like when Billy and Tommy will bring up Nicky to her at random– something that would earn her rage from an adult but instead draws out a softness when delivered by their young, earnest voices.</p><p>“Did she now?” Agatha asks, playing up her interest. At Lorna’s enthusiastic nod, she continues, finding herself smiling along with the girl. “Miss Rio used to play basketball at our school, a long time ago. Did she show you how to shoot the ball too?”</p><p>Lorna’s eyes grow impossibly wider, clearly delighted with Agatha’s engagement and the gift of new information about her friend. She holds up her hands, spreading her fingers out like she’s clutching an invisible basketball. Agatha’s heart gives a painful <em> thump</em>.</p><p>“Uh huh! She held me up to the basket ‘cause I’m too small to reach it myself. But she said when I get big ‘n tall I’ll be really really good at it.” She nods solemnly, like Rio’s words had been a prophecy. Despite herself, the corners of Agatha’s lips tilt up further.</p><p>She sees Alice and Jen find each other’s hands beneath the table out of the corner of her eye, and she knows what they’re thinking. They’re watching their daughter and wondering if her small, sick body will ever heal enough for her to be big and tall and do something as simple as run around and play a game of basketball. Wondering if by sheer willpower alone they can give her the future that she deserves.</p><p>Agatha finds her own mind wandering, pulling on the thread of a thought until she’s remembering a small plastic hoop in the driveway that became a real hoop as Nicky got bigger, lingering to watch him and Rio laughing and giggling and running in circles around one another before calling them both inside for dinner.</p><p>It stings like salt water in a wound, but it feels cleansing all the same. Something in her loosens with the quiet relief that Rio still gets to have moments like that– passing on her knowledge and her enthusiasm and her care, even if it isn’t to her own boy. Their boy.</p><p>Lorna, oblivious as ever and having reached the end of her thought, goes right back to coloring. She picks up the pink crayon and begins scribbling something indecipherable with the concentration of a renowned artist. For a moment, Agatha only watches.</p><p>The deposition terrifies her. The support group and Alice and Jen’s attention and all of the people suddenly present in her once-silent life all terrify her. But if this lawsuit can do anything at all to help the kids like Lorna– to fight for their futures and their dreams and a sense of justice for their suffering– then maybe Agatha can live with that. If she has to.</p><p>The thought crumples something in her chest before smoothing it back out again, her breath skipping and settling back down. It’s not the blinding sense of dread about the deposition she'd come here hoping for, but it’s something to hold her attention in the meantime. Agatha signals for the waitress and asks for the check.</p><p>Alice and Jen both splutter for a moment when the waitress brings back a single check and Agatha hands her card over without looking, something like indignation on their features. Agatha rolls her eyes, unwilling to play out the song and dance of it all.</p><p>“We’re not some charity case, Agatha. We don’t need your pity,” Jen snaps.</p><p>This time, it’s Agatha’s turn to look at Jen like she’s stupid enough for it to qualify as a medical marvel. The look feels much better to give than it did to receive.</p><p>“You’re right. You wouldn’t be having your lunch paid for if you were. I would never give my hard earned money to charity.”</p><p>The lie is immediately worth it if only for the look of total slack-jawed shock on Jen’s face that quickly curdles into a cross between disgust and begrudging respect as she watches Agatha stand from her chair, signing the check that the waitress drops back off. Alice watches them both with thinly-veiled amusement.</p><p>“There is something seriously wrong with you.”</p><p>Agatha flashes an award winning smile. “There sure is, Jenny Kale. Let’s hope Perlman’s guys can finally get to the bottom of it.”</p><p>With that, Agatha leaves the cafe with a flourish, giving no parting beyond a small wave tossed to– and eagerly returned by– Lorna. Despite the choking heat that greets her outside, Agatha’s still smiling long after the door has chimed shut behind her.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>With the lunch with Alice and Jen beneath her belt, Agatha drags her churning thoughts along into the work week.</p><p>She dials into her mandatory team calls, ignores several dozen important emails, and shoots Hela a text about the upcoming marketing report that hits every buzzword without saying anything of substance at all. So long as her thoughts stay clear of the fact that her deposition for the lawsuit is only a week away, it’ll be fine.</p><p>Agatha hasn’t thought about returning to the support group either, despite Lorna’s subtle guilt tripping. It wouldn’t do anything to soothe her uneasiness, and those people post every goddamn thought they have in the group chat anyway, so it’s not like she’s missing out.</p><p>No, Agatha’s phone has buzzed for every single meeting reminder, doctor’s appointment update, and post-deposition celebration. At this point it probably qualifies as a vibrator in its own right. When it chimes again against her kitchen counter, Agatha doesn’t think to step away from the half-cooked risotto she’s stirring on the stovetop, content to let whatever asinine comment Jeff Kaplan has made wait.</p><p>It’s only a moment later when the buzzing stops being an intermittent sound and becomes a solid stream that Agatha glances up, watching a veritable flood of messages flash across her home screen. Frustrated, she sets her wooden spoon down and turns, scooping the device up and scanning the first message that she sees. Her stomach drops, ice pouring into her veins.</p><p>Someone else’s kid is dead.</p><p>It isn’t one of the couples Agatha met, she doesn’t think. She tries scanning back in her memory to Alice’s run down on the night she’d gone, but there are no faces she can put with the names in the messages. Only a concept, an abstract imagining that holds her throat in its crushing grip.</p><p>There are condolences and messages of shared sorrow, memories offered of their son’s laughter or his mischief or his resilience. Apologies. An acknowledgement that he had been doing so well, that they thought things had been looking up.</p><p>Agatha breathes through the stabbing ache in her chest; a hurt for both these people that she doesn’t know and for her own memories that their loss invokes. She shuts her eyes against the onslaught, clutching at the phone in her hand like it could ever save her.</p><p>They’d tucked Nicky into bed no more than an hour before, pressing two kisses to his crown and shutting off the lights. His anguished cry had reached them down the hall like thunder splitting open the sky, and in memory they were out of their bed and by his side in less than two seconds flat. Even then, it hadn’t been quick enough.</p><p>She remembers his little body, unresponsive even as Rio shook his shoulders and hoisted him into her arms. It had been a nightmare, maybe. Something that had scared her baby so badly that it ruptured the aneurysm in his brain.</p><p>His messy hair that Rio had always joked came from Agatha tucked behind his ears, his rumpled dinosaur pajamas, his stuffed rabbit curled against his chest like it could protect him. They’d brought the rabbit with them in the ambulance, she remembers, so he could have it when he woke up.</p><p>The tears that glistened on his reddened cheeks and the unimaginable horror of knowing that there was nothing that she could do to help him. That handful of nauseating minutes that they'd waited for the ambulance. Nicky died four hours later in a bright, stale room, lying in a hospital bed while Agatha gripped one of his hands and Rio held the other.</p><p>When finally they had to pull away– hours or days or lifetimes later– his little hands were ghost white, like he’d donned a pair of gloves. Contact blanching, Agatha had seen it called some time later. When someone dies and the people who love them can’t let go, the pressure of their touch displacing the now stagnant blood.</p><p>Snow white skin left behind to go where their hands can’t follow, as if to say <em> I don’t know where you’re going next, but please take my love with you. I wouldn't know what to do with all of it anyway. </em></p><p>The sting in her eyes comes hot and fast. She leaves them shut, counting each shaky breath until the feeling dissipates into something quieter. When it does, she sets her phone back on the counter face down, silencing the ringer.</p><p>There’s no message she could send that would help those people. She’d be just another mouth spewing the same stream of useless bullshit that won’t bring their kid back, a name with no face joining the endless choir amplifying their agony. For a moment Agatha considers calling Wanda instead, though the thought sours as soon as it comes. They may be friends now, but what could Wanda realistically do about it? And why should Agatha pull her away from her two living children just to console her about her dead one?</p><p>An acrid smell fills her nose and her eyes shoot back to the stove, finding her risotto less than thirty seconds away from becoming a true fire hazard. She lifts the pan and snaps the burner off, throwing a lid over what will certainly be an offering to her trash can and setting it aside to be dealt with later. No dinner, then. She presses the heels of her hands into her eyes and shakes her head to clear the scream building in her throat. Some of her hair falls loose from the bun she’d thrown it into at the motion, whispering across the backs of her knuckles. <em> It doesn't matter. </em></p><p>Agatha pivots, leaving her phone in the kitchen and settling onto the couch. Maybe mindless TV can take up enough space in her head to drive out the bone-deep ache of memory threatening to sweep her under its tide. She flips through the channels if only to feel the grounding pressure of the remote in her hand, finally settling on something at random. Agatha wiggles further into the cushions, trying to find a shred of relief in the fact that she’d already changed into a tank top and sweats before making dinner and doesn’t have to drag her body up the stairs right now to change.</p><p>She gets fifteen minutes– the opening shot of the plane, the reading of the quote, the establishing of some nefarious mystery– before there’s a knock at her door. Agatha looks between the TV and the bit of the foyer that she can see from her spot, debating if anything that might be on the other side of that door could be worth losing her progress towards total disassociation. But the knock comes again, albeit quieter, less sure. She goes.</p><p>Agatha tries to summon some emotion when she sees her through the frosted glass but finds, pulling the door open and looking Rio in the face, that there is only the numbness that has been creeping in since she checked her phone. Rio’s still in her work clothes– a high neck sleeveless blouse and black slacks– though her briefcase is nowhere to be seen. Her hands, usually tucked into her pockets, are fidgeting at her sides.</p><p><em> She’s nervous</em>, Agatha realizes. It’s only apparent because she’s really looking at her, not looking through her or searching for some hidden motive. Just looking, seeing. Agatha doesn’t have the energy to do more than that.</p><p>So she sees that Rio is nervous and somehow almost shy and definitely upset. Not angry, though. Rio’s eyes flash around Agatha’s face, darting behind her into the dimly lit house before coming back into focus. She clears her throat and opens her mouth, only nothing comes out. A quiet, shaky sigh passes through her lips.</p><p>Agatha remembers, with a startling clarity, what she had said after Lilia’s party. The offer she had made. A line forms, tracing from the memory to a new thought and circling once– Rio is in the support group text chain, too. She must have seen the messages.</p><p>Rio, who goes to the stupid meetings frequently enough to teach Lorna how to shoot a basketball and to woo the Kaplans. Enough that Alice references her with an easy familiarity. Enough that maybe she knew these people and their son. Or maybe she didn’t. The possibility stings in Agatha’s chest all the same.</p><p>“I’m watching <em>Criminal Minds</em>,” Agatha says. The calm, even tone of her voice surprises her. “Paget Brewster’s first season.”</p><p>Rio visibly relaxes, some of the tension bleeding from her frame as her shoulders drop a hair. Agatha can see it, then. The armor she’d put on, unsure if she had been right to take Agatha at her word. But Rio had come anyway, half expecting to be berated.</p><p>The stinging in Agatha’s chest twists into a full burn, the flames singeing her ribs and licking at the bars around her heart. She knows she was right to be angry, was justified in her isolation and her rage and her distance. Even so, this feeling has always lingered to some degree in the aftermath– this baseline, gut-wrenching sorrow at seeing Rio be wary of her. Even when Agatha knows she’s the reason, knows why she had to do it, that voice always comes back to remind her that as much as she’d lost a safe place in Rio, Rio had lost a safe place in her too.</p><p>Agatha steps aside and watches in silence as Rio crosses the threshold, pulling her shoes off and setting them dutifully on the rack before heading to the living room, perching herself just on the end of the couch by the armrest. Agatha catches herself before she can say something stupid like <em> that’s not your spot </em> and closes the front door instead, joining her in the living room and settling back into her seat on the other side. The distance feels exaggerated, and when Agatha inhales it feels like shards of glass are rattling around in her lungs.</p><p>The air crackles with something quiet and tense while the show plays on. Agatha tries to focus back on the episode, but she can see Rio shifting out of the corner of her eye. Can hear her every breath. Rio's anxiety radiates off of her in waves, butting forcefully up against Agatha's own. Finally, if only for the sake of doing something with her hands, Agatha picks herself up and goes upstairs, rooting around for a minute before going back down to the living room. Rio looks small and uncertain from the landing, suspicious in the way a stray cat would be of a human trying to coax it out from behind a dumpster.</p><p>Agatha tosses the contents of her hands into Rio's lap– an old pair of boxer shorts and a white hoodie with a faded ABBA print across the front.</p><p>“It’s dumb to sit here in your work clothes. You can borrow these.”</p><p>If Rio thinks anything about how Agatha is offering to loan her her own clothes, she doesn’t mention it. She merely dips her head in acknowledgement, the corners of her lips quirking upward in a movement so brief Agatha can’t be sure she didn’t imagine it. Something shifts all the same.</p><p>“Thanks.”</p><p>She rises, disappearing into the little guest bathroom back behind the kitchen. Agatha exhales, the knot in her chest loosening ever so slightly as she lowers back onto the couch. The spell that had made everything feel drawn taut is broken, but now what? She feels like her mind is lagging three steps behind.</p><p>When Rio reemerges with her clothes folded neatly in her hand and the sleeves of her hoodie pushed up on her arms, it feels oddly like seeing a mirage. She sets the stack carefully on the table before stopping in the kitchen on the way back. Agatha listens to the cabinet open and shut as Rio pulls down a glass, shuffling over to the fridge to fill it with water.</p><p>Rio, here in her pajamas with Agatha on a week night, watching TV. Rio, moving around the house like it’s hers because it was.</p><p>The shuffling stops, the water dispenser going quiet.</p><p>“I genuinely can’t tell what you were trying to cook in this pan,” Rio’s voice floats in from around the wall.</p><p>Agatha blinks once, twice. “Don’t talk about my risotto like that.”</p><p>Her laughter carries in before her head pops around, leaning over the sink to see Agatha in the kitchen.</p><p>“Did you want water while I’m up?”</p><p>Agatha opens her mouth, finds that she doesn’t trust her voice, and closes it again. It's domestic. Something a bit too close to care not to chafe. She swallows, shaking her head. Rio nods, a small smile still on her face as she flips off the kitchen light and walks back around to take her seat once more.</p><p>The silence that they settle into is no longer tense but still Agatha takes no comfort in it, fighting against the urge to grind her teeth as something like panic sinks in instead. Where Rio seems to be getting lighter as the minutes pass, Agatha can feel a sinking weight taking root in her chest.</p><p>Rio’s number was blocked for a reason. They didn’t talk beyond cruel jabs for a reason. They didn’t see one another outside of sex for a reason. Her eyes flash as she blinks, a memory of a different day in this room clawing at the walls of her skull.</p><p>Agatha had been on the phone with someone– Lilia or Hela or some other unfortunate soul she’d worked with at the time. She can’t remember what she’d said, only the warm relief of the venom-coated words leaving her throat and the weight of Rio’s eyes boring into her from the landing. Agatha knew, even before she’d finished the conversation, that this was going to be another fight. She hung up the phone and set it in her lap, looking at Rio with that still sort of calm that reeks of madness.</p><p>“Why are you acting like this?”</p><p>It was the most straightforward Rio had been about it, typically opting to tip toe around the whole thing when they were alone. Agatha batted her eyelashes, giving a mock pout.</p><p>“Acting like what, honey? Is my grief not pretty enough for you? Hoping I'll do a little song and dance?” She can still remember how Rio had flinched, a sight that wasn’t new by then but stung all the same.</p><p>“Just <em> talk </em> to me, Agatha! I can’t bear to see you hurting yourself like this. Tell me how I can help you,” she pleaded, those big eyes glassing over in their desperation. Of course, Rio wanted to fix her. Had wanted what everyone wanted– for Agatha to be less, to be better. To be something easier to ingest when her soul had just been torn from her body. Or at least it had felt that way.</p><p>She sneered, ignoring the plea. “If you can’t bear to see it then don’t fucking watch, Einstein. I’m sure the members of your little fan club are tripping over themselves to suck your dick, why don’t you go ahead and let them?” Agatha gave a dismissive wave of her hand to punctuate the thought.</p><p>Rio’s features twisted from the middle ground of confusion and into fury. It felt like a veil being lifted, like Agatha was finally getting to see something true, even if it made her blood run cold.</p><p>“It’s not just yourself you’re hurting, you know that? It’s everyone around you, anyone you think you can sink your claws into. You’re hurting <em>me</em>, you fucking selfish cunt. <em>Our</em> <em>son</em> is dead and all you care about is your twisted little power trip. Do I even matter to you anymore?”</p><p>She was screaming, her voice working its way to a crescendo. When Rio was done her chest heaved with the labor of her breathing, shaking against the rage lining her frame. But Agatha only looked at her. Empty. Resentful. So isolated in the prison of her own grief that not even Rio could get her out again, not even Rio could pry her way through the bars.</p><p>Agatha remembers the words hitting her ears as though they had come from someone very far away, all significance lost on her. She remembers the disappointment, the fleeting hope that Rio’s anger would draw something other than the same out in herself quickly dashed.</p><p>Though they’re garbled in her memory, Agatha’s sure there was more screaming after that, more words hurled like fists. They all slip like water through her hands until the memory stalls again, thick and sticky in her mind as the ending comes into view. Rio’s face, tear stained and resigned, looking for all the world like Agatha had cracked her in half.</p><p>“Okay, Agatha.”</p><p>That was all she’d said. No signature <em> te veo</em>, no pleading to make it work. Just a suitcase rolling behind her and her car keys in her hand. Agatha can still hear the door shutting behind her, not quite a slam but not gentle. Can remember the hush that had fallen over the house, like even the beams holding the structure together knew that Agatha was finally alone.</p><p>Agatha remembers wondering, when she still hadn’t moved minutes later, when Rio had packed. And then weeks later, when she started to feel something closer to lucid, how she could have let Rio leave.</p><p>How could she have betrayed all of her vows, forsaken all of the oaths they’d whispered in dorm rooms and on back roads and huddled together on the floor of their brand new empty house? How could Agatha abandon the only woman she’d ever love?</p><p>But she had. Had all but pushed her to the door and waved as she walked through it. Had let her grief and her rage turn her into a monster without so much as a fight.</p><p>By the time Agatha had even thought to be remorseful, the damage was done. And it wouldn’t have been fair to apologize even if she’d wanted to, would it? Because even if she could ever earn Rio’s forgiveness- could ever forgive Rio herself- she couldn’t trust herself not to hurt her again. Not to sink her teeth in at the first whiff of blood in the water.</p><p>So Agatha had done what was best and built the walls higher, keeping everyone far enough away that the only person her rage could burn was herself and showing her teeth when they came too close.</p><p>But then Rio came back. And again, and again, and now they’re sitting a mere four feet apart on a Wednesday night watching <em>Criminal Minds</em> all these years later like it’s nothing. Like Agatha isn’t coming apart at the seams.</p><p>Agatha feels herself starting to shatter and tightens her grip on all of her fractured pieces, focusing on not letting Rio see her fall apart and ignoring the sharp edges digging into her palms. It was a bad idea to let Rio in tonight and to make the offer the other week. She's had a great many bad ideas lately, it seems.</p><p>The plot line plays out on the screen- the victim is saved just in the nick of time, the unsub is in cuffs. It's a job well done even if the people from the beginning of the show are still dead. Even if the blood stains will never come out of the carpet. When Agatha finally looks over again, Rio is asleep.</p><p>She’s curled up in a throw blanket on the other end of the couch, half buried in her hoodie. Her hair is fuzzy from rubbing against the pillows. The glow of the TV illuminates the frizz like a halo around her head. Rio looks younger this way, the purple bags under her eyes less prominent and the crease between her brows momentarily smooth.</p><p>Agatha wants to shake her awake and kick her out so she can be free from the rising waters of their shared past choking in her lungs, from this god awful, all-consuming <em> want</em> that won’t let itself be filed down into something as simple as lust or loathing.</p><p>Agatha wants to slip into the space between Rio’s body and the couch and stay there until they mold into one, until the whole world disappears and there is no painful past to drown her or terrifying future waiting ahead, only skin on skin. She just wants a moment to put down her grief and her guilt and her remorse and let the animal of her body feel safe, even if it isn't real. But she can't.</p><p>Fearing what she’ll do if she follows the train of thought any further, Agatha quietly rises to go through the routine of turning off all the lights, double checking that the front door is locked and tossing the now cool pan in the trash. She adds an extra blanket on the couch near Rio’s feet, knowing that they always get cold in the night. If this was five years ago, Agatha would dig out a pair of fuzzy socks and slide them on for her, thinking nothing of it. Actually, if this was five years ago, Agatha would press a kiss to her temple before pulling her up the stairs and to bed so that she wouldn't wake up tomorrow with a sore back. As it is, the extra blanket will have to suffice.</p><p>The stairs feel more daunting this time, her body growing heavier and heavier beneath the full weight of the evening as it bears down. When Agatha finally drags herself into the familiar comfort of her bed, she releases the hold on her shattered remains and watches them all clatter to the floor, letting the tears come.</p><p>She can’t help but feel a faint jab of amusement at the poetic irony in Rio sleeping soundly on the other side of the house while she cries in this room.</p><p>She can’t help but know that there’s no part of this pain that she doesn’t deserve.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>When she wakes the next morning to the cold daylight staining her pillow, Agatha gives herself thirty seconds to exist in a different reality. The seconds tick down to twenty while she pretends that Rio is still downstairs, making herself some tea and brewing Agatha’s coffee in that perfect way she’d never figured out how to master on her own.</p><p>Fifteen seconds, and nobody is dead. Everyone is where they’re meant to be– Nicky is getting ready for school down the hall and that other little boy watches his father make breakfast. Even William Kaplan is out there somewhere, rolling his eyes at another paragraphs-long good morning text from Jeff.</p><p>Nine, and they both become capable of forgiveness, the words gliding smoothly out of Agatha instead of sticking in her throat. Seven and they have nothing to forgive one another for.</p><p>She scrunches her eyes tightly enough to see stars with three seconds left, pretending that the sound of Rio’s footsteps coming back up the stairs is reality and not just memory. The wood creaks on the second and eleventh steps, giving her away.</p><p>At zero, the window is gone and Agatha shoves it all away again, throwing back the covers and swinging her feet to meet the rug on her bedroom floor. In this reality, Agatha pulls her robe off of its hook on the back of her door and wraps it over her pajamas, making her way downstairs to get her morning started.</p><p>She tries not to feel the small pang in her chest when she makes it to the landing and sees the empty couch. The blankets are still in a rumpled heap on the cushions but as she continues on toward the kitchen she sees the hoodie and shorts folded neatly on the table, exactly where Rio had set her work clothes the night before.</p><p>Agatha debates the merits of taking the hoodie and its fresh Rio Smell not to the laundry room but up to her bed. Thinks about tucking it carefully in on the empty side just to have something there to disturb the flat sheets.</p><p>She clears her dry throat and the noise echoes in the quiet of the house, helping her to shift out of whatever weird trance she seems to be in this morning. No, she will not be doing anything with the pajamas beyond washing them and putting them away again. Coveting her ex-wife’s slept-in hoodie  would be freak behavior, she reminds herself, and not the good kind. More like a Victorian era man lusting over a woman’s handkerchief. Unforgivably pathetic.</p><p>Agatha finishes the short walk into the kitchen and settles into the motions of making her tea, pulling down two mugs and putting the second one back and pointedly thinking nothing of it. She stares at the kettle on the stovetop while she waits for the water to boil and lets her mind wander.</p><p>She approaches the daunting task of trying to get a read on whatever the fuck she’s feeling with all the poise of a child poking a hornets’ nest with a stick.</p><p>Agatha feels rather like she’s been thrust into a state of limbo, like having Rio over last night has sent a bunch of ants crawling up and around the inside of her skin. It was nice, in a way. It was awful. It was like pressing a flame-soaked brand into the tender wound of her heart. </p><p>Rio came over, yes, but maybe that’s because this literally used to be her house and sometimes a familiar space can be comforting. And Agatha hadn’t said anything cruel, of course, but only because she’d been too occupied with her own thoughts. None of it means anything.</p><p>Or at least she wishes it didn’t, refusing to blink until the kettle turns blurry as she tries to beat the idea into something shaped like the truth. It springs back into the lie it is with each repetition, and Agatha is thankful when the squeal of the kettle gives her something to do with her hands.</p><p>It’s not until she turns toward the fridge, prepared to root around for something that could pass as a breakfast, that she sees it.</p><p>A pale yellow sticky note curling up at the bottom edges and pressed onto the door of the fridge. <em> Thank you</em>, it reads in Rio’s looping scrawl. Like she’d done it in a hurry and left before she could reconsider it.</p><p>Agatha lifts her hand to run the pads of her fingers gingerly over the ink like the touch might transfer to Rio’s skin. She reads the words again and her gut twists with guilt that seems unwilling to settle. She drops her hand, swallowing against the sensation.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t done anything worthy of even this small show of gratitude and she knows it. The pen strokes turn to something mocking before her eyes. Something meant to taunt. She feels the sting of her anger begin to prickle under her skin and artfully resists the sudden, gnawing urge to rip the note from the fridge and swallow it. To let the harsh acid of her stomach dissolve the missive into nothingness.</p><p>She reaches a hand across the counter for her steaming mug, letting her palm wrap around the too hot porcelain. The pain of it grounds her, pulling some of the heat out of her chest and redirecting it out.</p><p>If it was a different time or she was a different woman, Agatha could receive the message for what it is without hesitation– Rio being honest and off hand and kind. She wouldn’t have to take the extra step of collaring the wolf that wears her skin before it can catch something tender between its gnashing teeth and throttle it until it becomes ugly.</p><p>Agatha lifts the mug to her lips and lets the tea scald her tongue. She wonders when exactly she crossed the threshold from woman to beast. If she could go back and pinpoint an exact moment. And if it was a betrayal to do so, would it be another betrayal to the beast if she turned woman once more? Could she do it, even if she tried?</p><p>But Agatha slept no more than an hour or two at most, and she’s too tired now to chase that train of thought to its end.</p><p>There is the ache left over in her body from the grenade of that boy dying and the memories it triggered, like she’d run a marathon and then been beaten with a shovel. The numbness that had seeped in and still lingers, old and familiar, no longer feels quite as welcome as it once did.</p><p>There is no safety in it, no promised escape from the discomfort of her life. Its presence is more akin to a cage this time around.</p><p>Buried far beneath the numbness and the exhaustion and the anger and her guilt swirls a golden sliver of relief at finding Rio at her door, twining its way between the festering gaps between her other emotions like a cool breeze. Holding its hand is something sharp and glittering. Something Agatha doesn’t feel brave enough to name yet.</p><p>Agatha collects her mug and carries it carefully back up the stairs to her home office, setting it on the coaster on her desk to let it cool the rest of the way. she sheds her robe and hangs it on the door knob, trading it out for a sweatshirt before sitting down in her desk chair and opening her laptop.</p><p>The house feels emptier today, which is stupid because it’s only as empty as it was the day before that and the day before that. Agatha navigates to the photo booth app and watches the little green light of the laptop’s camera click to life.</p><p>She assesses herself on the grainy screen, pulling her fingers through her hair until it looks ever so slightly less like a mess and adjusting the angle of the camera so that as little of her sweatshirt is visible as possible. It’s as close as she’ll get to performing professionalism. Agatha hopes everyone appreciates the effort.</p><p>She gets onto the Thursday morning team call like normal only to find that it’s not, in fact, normal. Hela and the others are nowhere to be found and instead it’s only her and Lilia on the call. When the computer chimes to announce Agatha’s arrival, Lilia looks up from the papers on her desk like she’s been waiting.</p><p>And, to be fair, Agatha is five minutes late.</p><p>She’s always five minutes late, but these sorts of things tend to become more apparent when a meeting is just two people. Which–</p><p>“Where is everybody?” Agatha asks. Her words come out thick and almost scratchy from a combination of not using her voice yet and the tender, burnt flesh of her tongue. Lilia doesn’t seem fazed.</p><p>“I didn’t need to talk to everyone today, just you. You’ve been ignoring me–”</p><p>Agatha’s dramatic sigh is loud enough to drown out Lilia’s words.</p><p>“-not just personally but at work, too. That’s not how this works, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha clenches her jaw.</p><p>“So you decided to trap me into a work call about it? Who knew you had so many fun little tricks up your sleeve,” she mocks.  Maybe she has been ignoring Lilia, maybe the shit she pulled at her birthday party last month had pissed Agatha off, even if it had turned out more or less alright. Sue her.</p><p>Lilia narrows her eyes. “If you would just talk to me more often then maybe I wouldn’t have to guess that things are fine.”</p><p>A frustrated growl rises and dies in Agatha’s throat, and she settles for an aggressive slurp of her tea instead. She and Lilia had never been much for talking about mushy shit. They didn’t have to say everything because they just <em> knew</em>.</p><p>Again, she tries gripping the beast by the scruff of its neck. Maybe they hadn’t talked about the sappy things almost ever, but they did used to talk more. Trips to Boston and phone calls to talk shit and texting about reality TV. Some of that had come back in the past few months, but most of it had gone to the wayside when everything else had and stayed there.</p><p>She tries, genuinely, to fight back against her mounting frustration. To give Lilia what she wants.</p><p>“Okay, Lilia. Somebody’s kid died yesterday, and they’re probably trying to figure out what to bury him in right now. And Rio came over because I told her that she could because <em> you </em> invited us both to your fucking party without saying <em> shit </em> to me, and you probably even got poor Helen drunk so that I’d have to ride home with Rio. Because I think you wanted me to crack, didn’t you? Digging your bony old fingers into all of my weak spots. I bet this has been so fun for you to watch.”</p><p>Agatha finishes her tirade, spitting the words out harshly and wrinkling her nose in anger. Lilia merely looks at her like one would a hissing cat that’s long been declawed. She doesn’t so much as blink.</p><p>“Well, for starters, congratulations on your verbal diarrhea. You were looking pretty emotionally constipated there.”</p><p>Agatha snarls.</p><p>“Yelena got herself drunk, but I’ll confess I’m not disappointed to hear you’re starting to crack.”</p><p>“You–”</p><p>Lilia plows on, unperturbed. Like she’s been waiting for this. “Would it really be so bad if things changed? I’ve watched you be miserable for almost four straight years, sue me for thinking I could help.” She throws her hands up. Agatha scoffs.</p><p>“You call what you did ‘helping’? You were meddling, and it was selfish.” Lilia’s eyebrows finally raise.</p><p>“Do you really want to talk about selfish right now?”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw snaps shut, aghast at the low blow. An echo of Rio leaving, fresh on her mind, rings through her ears again. How Agatha can do nothing but hurt those around her. The indignation she feels twists to something darker.</p><p>As if sensing the change, Lilia gives a long drawn out sigh, picking up a pen from her desk and tapping it against the wood. “Do you remember–”</p><p>“All I fucking do is remember. I don’t need you to force feed me some shit about how we used to be a happy family, Lilia. I was there,” Agatha cuts her off with a snap. Lilia’s face remains statuesque in its stillness. She waits for Agatha to be done and then tries again, her voice just as calm as when she’d started.</p><p>“Do you remember the fight the two of you had that autumn after you graduated college?”</p><p>Agatha’s rage stutters in her chest. Lilia doesn’t wait for her answer.</p><p>“You packed a bag and nearly beat my door down, told me you were going to stay at my place because you and Rio were done. You wouldn’t tell me what you’d fought about.”</p><p>Agatha lets her eyes fall from Lila’s face on the screen, looking down at her lap and running the pad of her thumb along her nails. Lilia’s voice curls around her.</p><p>“You spent one miserable, awful week moping around my brownstone. When I finally got it out of you, all you could say was that your mother was dead. You wept on my sofa like the world was ending.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twist into a tight line and she looks up with a furrowed brow. “That feels a bit exaggerated–”</p><p>“And finally I got you to admit that Rio had found out about your mom and had tried to say she was sorry, that she’d go to her funeral with you, and you’d exploded about it. You were so adamant that you weren’t upset that the old bitch was dead and so angry she’d think that you were. You told me that Rio had asked when you were going to figure out that she could see clean through you every time.” Lilia tilts her head contemplatively.</p><p>“I think you were just so unnerved by the truth of it. How someone could see you even when you couldn’t see yourself." Lilia gives a dismissive wave of her hand. "She was right, anyway, and you <em> were </em> upset, whether you wanted to be or not. You left my house that same night and the two of you were engaged a week later.”</p><p>Agatha runs her bottom teeth over her upper lip, blowing a sharp exhale out through her nose and tossing her hair over her shoulder.</p><p>“Yes. I know. Is there a reason we’re doing this, Calderu? Because right now it just feels really fucking rude and honestly a bit invasive.”</p><p>Lilia rubs a hand across her brow, something serious doubling down on her face when she looks back to the camera. Agatha tries not to flinch at it.</p><p>“You are allowed to be fragile and you are allowed to be sad and you are allowed to break, Agatha. What you are <em> not </em> allowed to do is pretend that you can protect yourself from those things by pushing the rest of us away and spiraling by yourself. If you’re angry with me then you need to tell me that. If you’re afraid that Rio will never forgive you then you need to tell her that. If you don’t feel like you can trust yourself then you need to put your trust in the rest of us. Do you hear me? Because all of this implosive, self-isolationist shit isn’t cute anymore.”</p><p>Agatha swallows past the lump in her throat, willing her hands to stop shaking.</p><p>“I wasn’t really going for cute anyway, more like sexy brooding villain.”</p><p>“<em>Agatha.</em>”</p><p>“Fine.” She feels like Lilia has laid her out like a frog on a high school biology table, prodding at all of her gooey insides with a dull pair of tongs. She opens her mouth, flounders, and closes it again. Why honesty always has to feel like peeling off her own eyelids with her finger nails, she’ll never know. Agatha looks at Lilia on the screen, sitting patiently at her desk with her hands clasped.</p><p>“I don’t know how to be the version of me that all of you seem to want. I don't think I could put this anger down if I tried.”</p><p>Lilia’s gaze softens like she’s watching a small bird make it’s first attempt at flight. Her voice is gentle when she responds.</p><p>“I want you to remember that the very worst possible thing has already happened and you’re still standing. You're punishing yourself for something that isn't going to change. Maybe it wouldn’t hurt to just try living like you’ve got nothing left to lose.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t want to admit that her knee jerk reaction is that she has so, so much left to lose. She thinks of the sticky note on her fridge. The blurry candid contact photo that Rio had chosen again for herself.</p><p>She leaves the call feeling both more and less like herself than before.</p><hr/><p>The morning of Tuesday August 11th is unseasonably cool.</p><p>Agatha stares at the ceiling in the dark, her alarm having gone off early enough that the sun hasn’t risen yet. The neighborhood is still caught in that silent predawn twilight before the world comes to life, and yet she finds she has the adrenaline levels of someone being hunted for sport.</p><p>Agatha feels like she’s about to take an exam that she couldn’t have studied for even if she wanted to and the grade of which will determine the trajectory of her life. It isn’t true, but could someone maybe try telling that to her body? Good God.</p><p>She rises from the bed and goes to the bathroom vanity to brush out her hair, hopeful that the repetitive motion may keep her jitters at bay. When her mass of brunette locks has been tamed into something more manageable, she slips into the outfit she set out for herself the night before.</p><p>It’s an olive green boat neck dress that falls to her knees, paired simply with her black pumps and a fitted black blazer. She leaves her throat bare but digs around in her jewelry box for the ring with the three interlocking hearts. Agatha allows herself to hope that the good luck charm works a bit better than it had when she’d last worn it before grabbing her bag and heading out.</p><p>It was only through a reminder text from Rio that Agatha had learned the deposition wasn’t going to be at Stephen’s office like she’d imagined but instead at Perlman’s people’s office in a suburb about half an hour outside of Boston. Had she read any of Stephen’s emails she could have known over a month ago, but by now Agatha is fairly certain that neither she or Stephen have any misgivings about the likelihood of that happening.</p><p>Agatha takes the drive in silence, psyching herself up as she weaves in and out of the early morning traffic. The sky transitions from hazy grey to a soft baby pink while she tries to keep in mind Lilia’s assurance that the worst had already happened and Alice’s calm voice telling her that Agatha’s deposition won’t be as intense as hers was.</p><p>And based on the support group chat, Jeff and Rebecca Kaplan seemed almost glad to have gotten the chance to talk to new people about William. Go figure.</p><p>By the time she makes it to the address she’d found on Google, the sun has risen fully and people are going about their days, juggling armfuls of brief cases and lunch boxes on their way inside.</p><p>The building is nondescript but clean– almost unsuspecting with its glossy bushes lining the small, freshly painted parking lot. But Agatha sees the shiny row of Bentleys and BMWs and a lone cyber truck tucked in against the building and glistening in the sunlight, each parked in a spot with a little sign that denotes ownership. All of it makes her feel uneasy, like she’s suddenly stepped into some weird Truman Show backdrop.</p><p>Agatha gets out of the car and locks it behind herself, smoothing out the faint wrinkles in her dress from sitting for so long. A car’s headlights flash as it locks a few spots down and Rio appears from beside it a moment later.</p><p>She’s dressed in a full grey suit, with a tie and everything. Her hair is cut back to her collarbones like it used to be, and in the shock of the change Agatha has the fleeting thought that she looks like <em> her </em> Rio again.</p><p>Like no time has passed. Like nothing awful has happened.</p><p>It feels like a gift– a small mercy. Agatha knows that Rio didn’t get the haircut for the sake of soothing her, obviously, but it settles something inside of her all the same.</p><p>Rio catches her stare and gives a nod of her head, her hands already tucked into her pockets. It reminds Agatha of their first meeting about the lawsuit at Stephen’s office in May and how Rio had been waiting for her then too.</p><p>She feels that same urge to bite and bark and claw, that desire to draw blood from any and everything in sight just to be sure that she’s not the only one that feels off kilter. But then she takes a few steps closer and can see the flicker in Rio’s eyes as she nears, the hand that pulls free of its pocket to adjust the already perfect knot of her tie shaking slightly.</p><p>The thirst for blood ebbs in Agatha like a falling tide. </p><p>“This place reeks of assholes.”</p><p>Agatha feels a rush of relief that they're going to play it this way, casual and light and leaving last Wednesday entirely unacknowledged. Her lips twitch up as she takes the last step towards Rio. “And good morning to you too.”</p><p>Rio tilts her head in the direction of the front doors. “Are you ready to do this?”</p><p>Agatha feels the weight behind the question, the sincerity with which Rio is asking. She watches Rio’s short hair sway with the motion of her head, brushing against the skin of her jaw, and thinks of how long it had been only last week, spread around her on the couch cushions. Agatha hums noncommittally.</p><p>“Already wasted the gas money to get here, didn’t I? Might as well at least see the inside of the building.”</p><p>The answer seems to be enough for Rio, and as always they walk to the entrance together, close enough that they brush shoulders every few steps. Stephen isn’t waiting for them at the receptionist’s desk, but he’d texted them both instructions on what to tell her and where to go once they made it in.</p><p>Again, Agatha follows Rio’s lead down one hallway and then another to an elevator, riding quietly along up to the fifth floor and stepping out behind her. The room that they’re looking for is one pace away from the elevator, and Rio pulls the heavy door open for her.</p><p>The room is not the wood paneling and big windows of Stephen’s office. Instead, it feels closer to an interrogation room, with bright offensive lights and an old rectangular table in the center. There’s a single window in the far left corner with the blinds firmly drawn.</p><p>There are no fake plants, no faintly floral air freshener smells. Only nondescript stock art framed on one wall and someone’s law degree on another. Agatha scans the small room in one sweep– ignoring all of the people already in it– and strides confidently into the room with all of the false bravado that she can muster.</p><p>She squeezes in at the far end of the empty side of the table. The chairs creak as she settles in and Rio does the same behind her, filling the manufactured quiet of the room with their awkward shuffling.</p><p>To Agatha’s left, Stephen sits awkwardly pinned between the corner of the too-small table and the wall, clearly trying to stay close to the two of them but giving them enough space to not be pressed together. She could almost be proud of him for the thoughtfulness of the gesture, but several other things feel more pressing at the moment.</p><p>A boy that Agatha doubts is an actual adult sits in a folding chair in the corner behind the three of them, and when she shoots her eyes his way, he gives a warm smile and a small inclination of his head. <em> Peter</em>, she thinks his name might be. Stephen had said he’d be bringing one of his junior partners to help take notes. She wasn’t aware that law firms were allowed to violate child labor laws, but who knows.</p><p>On the opposite side of the room caddy corner to Peter and in a similarly shitty folding chair, is the court stenographer. Her charcoal pantsuit is crisply pressed and her stenotype sits on a little folding table just in front of her. The woman looks serene in her boredom, like anything at all could happen in this room and she wouldn’t bat an eye so long as she gets out of here in time for lunch.</p><p>Agatha muses that her glasses are too small for her face, the tiny lenses sitting low on her nose. But maybe that’s just the style now. She gets the vague sense that the room is set up a bit like a WWE ring, though she certainly doesn’t have enough knowledge about wrestling to say for certain. Agatha finds herself wanting to share the observation with Rio. She does not.</p><p>The three figures across the table sit in such a way that their heights form a perfect bell curve. They must have practiced this. Again, Agatha keeps this thought to herself.</p><p>In the center is a big man with beady little eyes and oil slick hair greased flat to his skull. The stench of his cologne is so strong that Agatha resists the urge to gag, to lean over and press her nose to the soft skin of Rio’s throat for an antidote.</p><p>Beside him sits a mousy blonde with her hair pulled back into a severe low bun and wearing a navy skirt suit with obscene shoulder pads. When she flashes a smirk as their eyes meet, Agatha wonders if all of her teeth have been filed to points or if she just naturally resembles a shark.</p><p>A wisp of a man flanks the big one’s other side across from Agatha, his position almost mirroring Stephen across the table like the other two had sat down and forgotten they needed to leave space for him too. Or maybe they just didn’t care. This one hadn’t so much as looked up when she and Rio walked into the room, his nose pressed firmly into the binder before him.</p><p>Contrary to the stenographer, his glasses seem to dwarf the rest of his face. Agatha can see the staining from pen ink on the side of his palm.</p><p>Stephen is doing introductions, she realizes. Maybe the Perlman lawyers have names they’d like to go by, but Agatha decidedly does not give enough of a fuck to pay attention to them. She’s already dubbed them Big One, Shark Smile, and Wisp in her head. Why change a good thing?</p><p>Beside her, she can half-see how Rio nods along with their pleasantries but offers no smile of her own. <em> Good, </em> Agatha thinks. At least she isn’t turning on the fake charm for these rats.</p><p>Agatha forces herself to take a deep breath, adjusting her blazer and taking a final scan of the bleak, sour smelling room before it all begins. She recalls, briefly, the last time she had sat next to Rio at a conference table and wanted her to get the very loud, very violent message that they would never be on the same team again.</p><p>Now, in this whole room of people, it only matters to her that Rio is here too.</p><p>When Agatha brings her focus back, the introductions have ended. Stephen straightens his spine and  somewhere behind her Peter lets out a long, slow breath. The stenographer clicks the stenotype to life and poises her fingers above the keys.</p><p>The deposition begins.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Big One opens the unadorned black three ring binder that rests on the table before him, revealing an array of papers. Some are shoved into the flimsy pockets on the front and back covers while others sit in shiny sheet protectors snapped into the rings. Agatha wonders how he decided which to put where or if there’s an assistant down a hall somewhere who made the choice for him.</p><p>In a carefully rehearsed performance of grace, he thumbs past the first two pages in the front pocket and pulls out the third, seemingly immune to the collective breath the room is holding. He adjusts the paper to where only his side of the table can read it, pulling a pen out of the inside pocket of his suit jacket and clicking it noisily three times. Finally, he looks up at them.</p><p>He lets his eyes pass over Rio and Agatha in a slow slide, smiling in a way that raises the hairs on the back of Agatha’s neck.</p><p>“Ladies, thank you for coming in for this deposition today. As you know, the purpose of all of this is to get to the truth of the matter– to understand the factual order of events as they happened, regardless of any emotional weight that may be placed upon them.” Big One's smile turns fractionally sharper, pushing the apples of his cheeks up into his eyes.</p><p>“I know this must be difficult for the both of you, but I can assure you that each question we ask you today will be done so with the goal of obtaining as much information as we can while gaining clarification on your testimonies, which–” he lifts the first two page protected sheets in the binder between his pointer and middle finger, waggling them in the air– “we have right here, courtesy of Mr. Strange.” Big One throws a wink at Stephen and Agatha watches the muscle of his jaw tick before he gives the slightest nod of acknowledgement.</p><p>She’d given Stephen the testimony as part of her deposition prep all the way back in June, more or less watching as he pieced together bits of what she said outright and giving vague answers until he’d presented her with something more or less coherent. Agatha can see flashes of her own oversized signature scanned onto the page between Big One’s fingers.</p><p>“I’ll have Connie swear you both in and then we can go ahead and get this show on the road.” His eyes glimmer, almost giddy.</p><p>The stenographer– Connie, apparently– doesn’t move from her designated corner while administering the oath to first Rio and then Agatha. Her words fall flat and monotone like she’s simply a robotic extension of her stenotype. When it’s her turn, Agatha resists the urge to roll her eyes as she parrots the words <em> so help me God. </em> If there is a god, he’s not in this room. And he certainly won’t be helping Agatha.</p><p>“Perfect. I’ll start by acknowledging for the record that Mr. Strange has the chance now to ask you both any further questions of his own.”</p><p>Big One glances down at one of the pages that Shark Smile has in her own manila folder, nodding when she points at a line of text with the tip of her pen.</p><p>“Mr. Strange has here that you’ve both waived this portion of the deposition. Can you confirm that for us?”</p><p>Stephen had told her about this part, Agatha remembers. She had waived her right to it before he’d even finished explaining in hopes of not dragging the whole ordeal out any longer than necessary. Rio, seemingly having done the same, offers only a sharp “yes, that’s true.”</p><p>Agatha’s “yep” is received with a twinge of Shark Smile’s nose like she’s holding back a sneer.</p><p>“Good.” Big One claps his stupid, swollen looking hands together. “We’ll start with the general and work our way to specifics. What was your son’s name?"</p><p>“Nicholas,” Agatha answers smoothly even though it feels like forking over something precious. Big One nods, gliding his pen down the line items on one of his sheets as he works through his questions. Wisp’s hand flies across his own page already. How he could have so much to take note on from a one word answer, she doesn’t know.</p><p>“And how did he die?”</p><p>Rio answers, her voice even and precise. “He had an intracranial aneurysm on his circle of Willis that ruptured in his sleep. The doctors and the medical examiner were unable to pinpoint the exact cause of the rupture.”</p><p>“How old was he when he passed?”</p><p>“Nine.”</p><p>“Why did you choose to use the Perlman Clinic to conceive?”</p><p>This one, Agatha knows. She beats Rio to the punch.</p><p>“We lived in Boston at the time and it was our most convenient option. They had good reviews too, but we all see how that turned out.” Agatha gives a smirk at the twitch she sees in Shark Smile’s eye.</p><p>“Of course, it would have been much less of a hassle if two women could conceive naturally,” she adds, almost off-hand. “Very sad that science hasn’t made it that far yet. But lord did we try.”</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, Agatha watches Rio’s tongue poke into the side of her cheek as she tries not to laugh. Across from her, Wisp’s cheeks turn crimson. It starts to feel a little like winning.</p><p>Big One carries on unfazed, lobbing them a handful of questions about their experience with the clinic itself, its employees, and the process of undergoing reciprocal IVF. Rio takes over, answering each of them with a suave firmness that boxes out Big One’s oversized ego. In her suit she looks regal and formidable in the way that had struck Agatha as chilling all the way back in that coffee shop bathroom in February. Now, watching it be directed towards someone else, she finds herself slightly appreciative for her offputting ex-wife once more.</p><p>“Would you say you had any concerns about the Perlman Clinic at the time that they assisted you in conceiving your son?” Big One clips, not bothering to look up at Rio as he moves down his list, scribbling a small note in the margins.</p><p>Rio pauses, seeming to contemplate her answer. Agatha wonders how much longer Stephen’s deposition prep had been with her. How many more questions she’d come prepared to answer.</p><p>“No, I wouldn’t say that we did. But to be fair, we didn’t have any prior experience with fertility clinics to go on. If I remember correctly, Perlman was the only one within an hour drive of the city at the time. So whether or not there were causes of concern that presented themselves, we couldn’t have been sure.”</p><p>It almost feels like watching Bobby Fischer play a game of chess in his early years to see Rio maneuver around the traps that he tries to set, her signature nonchalant grace on full display. Big One, however, seems much less impressed.</p><p>“Ms. Vidal, are you saying that you were unable to do research due to your general inexperience with parenthood or that you were unwilling to do research because you had already found the easiest option?”</p><p>Agatha bristles at the condescending tone, at the implication that he could look Rio in the face and find her incompetent. But Rio only gives him a wide smile and opens her eyes further, encasing amber irises in a ring of white.</p><p>“Actually, I would consider the research that we were able to do at the time to have been extensive, though the resources available left much to be desired. I’m sure you can imagine that there weren’t as many articles or books available for gay women starting families as there are now.”</p><p>Rio pauses just long enough for Big One to think she’s done talking. She continues the second his jaw loosens.</p><p>“Do you know when gay marriage was legalized?”</p><p>Whatever Big One was going to say turns into a quickly reversed breath, leaving him spluttering slightly as he suppresses a cough.</p><p>“It was legalized in the United States in 2015, Ms. Vidal,” he says, clearing his throat and rolling his shoulders to regain his composure. Rio nods, pleased.</p><p>“That’s right. Our son was two years old by then. So I’m sure you can imagine that society at large was not quite operating on our same timeline. Everything was an uphill battle.”</p><p>Agatha relishes in the nervous twitch of Wisp’s fingers and Stephen’s nearly silent hum of approval. Still, Big One tries to push.</p><p>“Now, Ms. Vidal–”</p><p>“Objection.” Stephen speaks up for the first time since the deposition started. His voice is cool steel, so unlike the nervous man she’d met in the first conference room or the panicked man from their phone call. Here at last is the seriousness that Alice had been talking about. “We’re getting off topic here. Either ask something relevant or move on.”</p><p>Big One looks to Stephen like he’s pleased to have gotten a rise out of the man, relinquishing with a small shrug as if to show how little the whole thing means to him. Shark Smile whispers something in his ear and the smile on his face grows.</p><p>Agatha had not liked these people when she walked in. Or even before that, when she’d thought of them only as a concept. But now, watching as they make no attempt to hide the nasty, bitter sort of delight that they're clearly taking in this, she decides that she really fucking hates all of them. Deeply and truly. She braces for where they may go next.</p><p>It’s Shark Smile who opens her mouth, directing her overdone vocal fry at Agatha. She doesn’t bother donning a fake smile of her own.</p><p>“Ms. Harkness, did Nicholas have any issues prior to his death?”</p><p>“No, there was nothing out of the ordinary.”</p><p>“Nothing at all? You’re certain?” Agatha narrows her eyes, wondering exactly how stupid this woman thinks she is.</p><p>“I am, but I feel like you have some ‘gotcha’ moment you’re hoping to pull out, dear. You’re practically panting.” Agatha pulls her hands from her lap long enough to form air quotes around the word.</p><p>Shark Smile purses her lips but pulls a sheet from her manila folder, setting it more visibly on the table. It’s clearly a blurry photo copy of a medical record, though with the angle they’re at, Agatha can’t tell what it’s from. She has a guess but waits for Shark Smile’s big reveal nonetheless.</p><p>“Ms. Harkness, do you recall taking your son to the Boston Medical Center and requesting that doctors perform a CT scan because you were afraid he had a concussion? If so, would it be fair to say that you wouldn’t consider such an injury to be– how did you put it– ‘out of the ordinary’? Were you regularly putting your son in potentially life-threatening situations, Ms. Harkness?”</p><p>To her right, Rio heaves a breath like she’s expecting Agatha to rip out the woman’s trachea. To her left, Stephen seems to be rifling frantically through his brain for a valid reason to object. Agatha only smiles, saccharine and indulgent.</p><p>“Let me make something clear, you failed office siren.” Agatha’s smile stays pinned in place, her voice a syrupy sweet coo. “Nicky was a perfect boy. He was nine when he died. There were cavities and scraped knees and, yes, one potential concussion when he was four years old from rolling too fast down a hill at the park.”</p><p>Nicky had not been a sick or accident prone boy. He was silly and he was wild and he was <em> nine years old. </em>She won't let them erase that.</p><p>Agatha leans forward ever so slightly, flashing her eyes. “And do you know what’s funny? When they did that CT scan, there was no aneurysm in his brain. No damage at all from his fall, actually. So maybe make sure your gimmick’s going to work before you try that shit again.” She sits back.</p><p>The upturned tip of Shark Smile’s nose reddens with her anger and Agatha feels as if she’s just won a rather spirited tennis volley. Big One eyes Agatha, absorbing her satisfaction and overall reactivity. Maybe picking at Rio hadn’t worked for him, but perhaps pulling at Agatha’s strings might. He clears his throat and flips to a new page in his binder.</p><p>“Like I said, we have both of your testimonies here but I just want to be sure we cross all of our T’s and dot our I’s here, everyone. Ms. Vidal, prior to your involvement in this lawsuit did you place the blame for Nicholas’ death on the Perlman Clinic or the donor in any way?”</p><p>Rio nods without hesitation, resting her clasped hands on the table in front of her.</p><p>“Yes, of course the potential for negligence had crossed my mind. I didn’t want to believe it but I did feel that the signs pointed to possible foul play.”</p><p>Agatha fights the expression of shock that threatens to overtake her face, keeping her eyes steadfast on Big One instead of looking over at Rio. Though, she supposes after a moment, it makes sense. Rio has always attacked every issue like a puzzle she can solve. Of course she had considered every angle.</p><p>And it’s not like they’d done much conferring on their thoughts about Nicky’s death or the assignment of blame. Surely if there had been anything glaringly different between what the two of them had told him in prep then Stephen would have handled it- would have molded them into something that could look like two people showing a united front.</p><p>“Ms. Harkness, I’d like to ask the same of you. Prior to your involvement in this lawsuit, did you place the blame for Nicholas’ death on the Perlman Clinic or the donor?”</p><p>This, she knows. Agatha proudly gives the same non-answer she’d rehearsed in Stephen’s office. “The doctors were very clear that it was a genetic abnormality that caused Nicky’s aneurysms, and the two sets of genes in his body were from Rio and from the donor. Rio’s test results were clear.”</p><p>Big One tsks at her in the way one would a poorly lying child. “That’s a yes or no question, Ms. Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha Harkness likes to lie. Better yet, she’s good at it. Great, even. But as she looks into those beady, unfathomably dark eyes, she realizes that lying about this feels too much like letting them win. Stephen and Peter and Shark Smile and even fucking Connie– all of them.</p><p>She straightens in her chair, tilting her head slightly as she holds Big One’s eyes. “No.”</p><p>Stephen’s eyes bug out of his head. Big One wets his bottom lip with a fat tongue like he’s been presented with a sizzling sirloin. The knuckles of Rio’s clasped hands on the table turn white, her nails leaving red crescents in her skin. But Agatha doesn’t stop.</p><p>“But maybe if you had half of a fucking brain cell beneath all of that hair gel, you would understand that a situation like this has nuance.”</p><p>Big One is smiling like he caught her in a trap, like he can see dollar signs behind his eyes. Wisp is writing furiously in his binder pages, smearing more ink across the meat of his palm. Still, Agatha’s eye contact doesn’t falter. Her voice doesn’t waver.</p><p>“I don’t know if you’ve ever lost anyone that you loved, Mr. Asshat– or even loved anyone to begin with– but grief is a funny bitch. It can be difficult sometimes to see the bigger picture. So I didn’t blame the clinic for his death. Not because I thought they were innocent, but because I didn’t know it was an option.”</p><p>Stephen’s heart seems to have caught itself before bursting, a single bead of sweat running down his temple serving as the only crack in his facade. She refuses to spare a glance to Rio, choosing instead to rest in the pride of the moment.</p><p>Shark Smile tilts her head faux-inquisitively. “Who did you blame then, Ms. Harkness? If not the clinic.”</p><p>Agatha shifts her eyes over to meet the woman’s. Imagines pulling each of her teeth out with rusty pliers.</p><p>“If you can tell me how that is any of your goddamn business then maybe I’ll consider answering.”</p><p>But Big One hums, dismissing Shark Smile’s line of questioning with a small wave before Stephen has time to object to it. He gives a sniff before moving his pen from the binder in front of him and using it to indicate something on Shark Smile’s page. She nods in silent agreement and he turns back to Agatha and Rio.</p><p>“Ok then. I feel like we can move on from Nicholas’ conception for now and look instead to his death.”</p><p>Agatha wants to press her thumbs into his eyes and pop them like soft boiled eggs. Wants to feel the yolk of his irises dribble down her wrists.</p><p>There are tedious questions about what the doctors had said specifically, and the coroner, and the EMTs that had picked him up in the ambulance. Others about the specific timeline of that night– the exact distance they lived from the local hospital, who rode with him and who drove their car, what the weather was like. Agatha watches Rio subtly check her watch two separate times. She feels the light drumming of a headache begin at her temples.</p><p>The light has not shifted– what with the closed window and the violent fluorescents overhead– but she speculates it must be at least 11:30 by now. Maybe later.</p><p>Finally, after what feels like hours, something in Big One’s expression shifts. The haze of professional formality that had fallen over his eyes lifts, revealing that unnerving glint again. He clicks his pen twice.</p><p>“Ms. Harkness, are you aware that children who are subjected to physical abuse develop a higher risk of stroke and often develop brain aneurysms as a response to blunt force trauma?”</p><p>Agatha shifts uneasily in her chair at the change, like catching an autumn breeze weeks before a chill is due. She looks to Stephen briefly, but he seems just as confused. Nodding his head in an indication for her to answer.</p><p>“Yes, I am. But I already told you earlier that the CT scan showed no damage.”</p><p>He carries on like Agatha never spoke at all, flipping through his binder as if searching for something. He doesn’t look up at her.</p><p>“At age twelve you told a school counselor that your mother was beating you. Child Protective Services took a series of photos documenting bruising along your ribs and torso, which we have here.” He lifts a handful of laminated pages absentmindedly, flashing them in the air. Still, he does not look up.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach turns to stone and sinks in her body. To her side she hears Rio’s exhale shake as it leaves through her nose.</p><p>“CPS found no proof of wrongdoing by your mother in their investigation, but let’s say you were telling the truth.” He looks up then, smiling without his eyes as they lock onto Agatha’s. He looks like a wolf.</p><p>“Multiple studies show that victims of domestic violence at the hand of a parent are likely to become perpetrators against their own children.” He tilts his chin down, giving her the look that one would when asking a child to behave. “Is it possible, Ms. Harkness, that you were <em> punishing </em> Nicholas in the same way that you were as a child and that it could have contributed to his death? And remember, you’re under oath.”</p><p>Rio shoots forward in her chair and opens her mouth, a response on her tongue. Shark Smile beats her to it.</p><p>“We didn’t ask you.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t spare her a second glance. “How <em> dare</em>–”</p><p>This time it’s Stephen who clears his throat, waiting until Rio catches his eye before shaking his head at her slightly. Silently, she fumes.</p><p>Agatha is walking the line between a slight tremor and fully shaking, working her jaw open and shut behind her lips and blinking rapidly as if it can clear away the rising tide in her mind.</p><p>Her childhood in that house. The time it had been so bad she couldn’t lift her arms to change for gym. Being sent to the guidance counselor and forced to report and still not being believed anyway. The things that her mother had done once the investigation was over and there were no watchful eyes left to see what became of Agatha.</p><p>The desperation that she’d felt to somehow please Evanora even when every attempt was futile. Even after all that she had done. The fear that still lingers– that she is everything her mother said that she was and worse. The idea that she could ever do something like that to anyone, let alone her baby. Their boy.</p><p>It clogs her thoughts like a burst floodgate. Beneath the table, Rio reaches out her hand and loops her pinky through Agatha’s on her lap, resting gently against the fabric of her dress.</p><p>For a moment the whole world is still. Then, the tide begins to recede.</p><p>A memory rises unbidden of the first and only time that Rio met Evanora Harkness.</p><p>It was the Thanksgiving break of their junior year of college, the falling leaves bathing the city in oranges and yellows and browns. Agatha had given in somewhere after the fourth or fifth phone call from her mother, leaving Rio on campus and catching the greyhound back home to Salem. Agatha had been so sure that when Rio had called the next night she’d kept the tremble expertly from her voice, projecting the same calm and confident facade she’d spent years perfecting.</p><p>Rio had been on her doorstep the next afternoon anyway, all gap tooth grin and a duffle bag slung easily over her shoulder. She’d introduced herself  as Agatha’s friend with that signature easy charm, not so much as flinching when the woman’s eyes had raked mercilessly over her without a word.</p><p>They had mustered up a good three hours of feigned civility between them, cooking dinner and getting the food all the way to the table before things went south. Agatha’s mother had called her a pig, maybe– or a dyke, or an abomination before God. Something that wasn’t unusual enough to bear remembering but that stung all the same. Rio hadn’t let the insult leave Evanora's mouth fully before she stood, informing the crone that she was an unbearable cunt that would never know how lucky she was to have had Agatha as her daughter. Those words Agatha remembers.</p><p>Rio had taken her away from there that night, driving them back to the city with a tight grip on Agatha’s thigh. Rio removed her eyes briefly from the road, flicking them over Agatha’s face once before turning back. She offered, with all of the sincerity in the world, to kill her mother.</p><p>Agatha felt the tension in her chest loosen, her hand enveloping Rio’s on her leg. “No, baby. They’d take away your scholarship.”</p><p>And that had been the end of it. She'd never had to see her mother again.</p><p>Agatha feels Rio’s pinky tighten around her own, the nail scratching lightly on her dress. She returns the gesture, takes a breath, and lets her rage become a cocked gun instead of a knife pointed inward.</p><p>“I am only going to say this one time,” she asserts, each word piercing. “I did not hit my son, but I <em> will </em> hit you, you son of a bitch.” She jabs the pointer finger of her free hand through the air at him, her elbow landing solidly on the table.</p><p>Big One only seems delighted by her rage, his eyes wide and pleased as he takes in her visible flush.</p><p>“Alrighty then,” he gives, as pleasant as if they’re talking about the weather. He cocks his head in Rio's direction, peeling his eyes from Agatha and flipping to another glossy page.</p><p>“And in the same vein Ms. Vidal, your foster care file indicates that you have a history yourself–”</p><p>Agatha shoots from her chair, dropping Rio’s pinky and slamming her hand down onto the table so forcefully that it resounds like a whip cracking through the room.</p><p>“<em>ENOUGH,” </em>she booms. Her finger stings where the force of the slap pushed Nicky’s ring into her skin, bound to bruise.</p><p>Big One has the decency to look somewhat cowed, leaned back slightly in his chair from where the noise had made him jolt.</p><p>“I think this is a good time for a recess, don’t you all?” Stephen’s voice reaches Agatha’s ears like he’s calling from the far end of a long tunnel, her body still poised like she’s anticipating a fight. When she sees the Perlman team nod in agreement and turn back to one another, Agatha pushes her chair the rest of the way back and slams through the door.</p><p>Agatha makes it down the stairs and bursts back out into the harsh sunlight of the parking lot, curving around to the corner of the building before slumping against the wall. It’s far warmer than it was when she’d dressed this morning and the rising anger and panic in her body are doing nothing to help. She rips her blazer down her arms and tosses it carelessly over the hood of the nearest car.</p><p>Her phone clatters down onto the pavement with the motion, mercifully landing face up this time. Agatha bends to scoop it up, her vision starting to blur as the screen flashes to show her a ‘<em>you got this!’ </em>text from Wanda and the digital clock's announcement that it’s a little past noon. She sets the device on the car with her blazer and leans her weight back against the side of the building, fighting through a shaky breath.</p><p>The flood that had overtaken her mind when Big One had asked his question seeps back in, building into a tidal wave in Agatha’s chest. She digs her nails into her thigh, desperate for something to ground her against the onslaught.</p><p>The accusation that they made. The way that they're sitting in there, treating the two of them like they're just subhuman pawns in the grand scheme of some game. The way that Stephen has hardly softened the blow, seemingly fine to let Perlman’s guys pummel them both.</p><p><em> I could run</em>, Agatha thinks. <em>Could get in the car right now and drive away and never think about this ever again.</em></p><p>But if she did, Rio would be here by herself. <em> Rio</em>. God, that ass face was going to bring up Rio’s childhood like it was some kind of trump card. A power play. Agatha grinds her teeth together just thinking about it, wondering how he could ever think he has any fucking right.</p><p>Maybe Agatha doesn’t have any right either to be angry like this on Rio’s behalf. She digs the heels of her palms into her eyes.</p><p>Letting Rio into the house the other night was a major fuck up that's left her feeling like up is down and all of her skin has been turned inside out. Or maybe it was the car ride home from Lilia’s that did it, or sleeping together after the bar, or letting Rio clean her sweatshirt in the coffee shop bathroom. Or all of the years of shit that happened before that.</p><p>Whatever it is, Agatha can feel herself fraying. Wearing thin at the edges. All of her carefully drawn lines are starting to blur and all of the shit that she’s pushed down is coming back up into her throat, waiting in the back of her mouth. </p><p>Agatha wants to scream, but she’s afraid that if she opens her mouth she’ll vomit up the last three and a half years.</p><p>Before she can start to hyperventilate in full, the front door of the building squeaks open and footsteps trail their way around to Agatha’s hiding spot. Rio appears in her field of vision moments later and walks around her without a second glance, leaning her own body against the building no more than a foot away.</p><p>Rio is silent as she pulls a carton of cigarettes out of her breast pocket, pulling one out and lighting it with ease. Agatha tracks the motion, wondering how she isn’t dying beneath the thick layers of her suit and feeling confusion begin to overtake her other emotions.</p><p>Rio takes a drag, resting her weight more fully against the building. She exhales through her nose, the smoke curling out of her nostrils and skimming the strong line of her jaw before dissipating. Rio turns, catching Agatha watching from the corner of her eye as if she wasn’t the one who came out here and stood next to her on purpose.</p><p>Agatha is so stunned by the display that she forgets she’s having a panic attack, forgets to look away and feign disinterest. She watches Rio’s lips close around the cigarette and her cheeks hollow with her inhale.</p><p>Agatha wants to tell her <em> I am going to burn down that building with all of them in it for ever thinking about you like that. </em></p><p>
<em> I can’t go back in there. Could we just go home? </em>
</p><p>
<em> I think if you asked me to right now, I’d forgive you for all of it. Could you forgive me too? </em>
</p><p>“Since when do you smoke?” She asks instead, her tone all accusation. Rio still doesn’t turn to face her fully, keeping the smoke to her other side. She shrugs.</p><p>“‘Bout two and a half years, I’d say.”</p><p>“I fucking hate the smell of smoke.”</p><p>Another puff. “Yeah, I know. I don’t do it a lot, just when I’m stressed.” She taps the cigarette between her fingers, ash fluttering to the sidewalk at her feet. Rio watches its descent. “And I always take two showers before I come to the house just in case.”</p><p>A silent beat passes. When Rio moves to raise the cigarette to her lips again Agatha plucks it from her fingers and takes a long drag, letting the nicotine soak into her system and cover her rage in a soothing blanket. When she holds it back out, it’s Rio’s turn to stare at her like she’s grown a second head. Agatha’s turn to shrug.</p><p>“I said I hate the smell of smoke. Doesn’t mean I don’t know how to do it.” When Rio still doesn’t take it back Agatha lifts it to her own lips again. “It was like a fucking magnet to the girls in Catholic school.”</p><p>Rio meets her eyes at that, the corners of her lips fighting to twitch up. It’s Agatha who laughs first, a snort leaving her against her will. Rio’s giggles follow shortly after, the whole scene entirely absurd.</p><p>Eventually their laughter dies out and Rio takes the cigarette back, dropping it to the sidewalk and grinding it beneath the toe of her heeled boot. When it’s done she checks her watch with a sigh. She pushes off the building and steps forward, picking Agatha’s blazer and phone off of the hood of the car and offering them back out to her.</p><p>“It’s time to go back in,” she says apologetically.</p><p>For just one second, Agatha debates asking her to leave. To give up on this cursed crusade and forget about it. Then she takes the blazer from Rio's hands, sliding her arms through the over-warm sleeves and tucking the phone into her pocket. Agatha turns to walk toward the door but is stopped by a hand on her shoulder.</p><p>She turns back, finding Rio waiting with something startlingly earnest in her eyes.</p><p>“You’re not your mother, Agatha. You never have been. I don’t want them to make you forget that.”</p><p>Agatha hears Lilia’s voice on their Thursday call begging her for honesty, for trust. Hears Rio, 23 years old and standing in their doorway when Agatha finally came back home, saying <em> I see right through you, Agatha. Siempre te veo. </em></p><p>Rio releases her hold on her arm, letting her touch slide down to Agatha’s wrist before dropping her hand completely. Agatha holds her eyes for a moment longer, searching.</p><p>“You should quit smoking.”</p><p>Together, they walk back into the building.</p>

<p>Remnants of sunlight still cling warmly to Agatha’s skin as she walks back into the jail cell of a conference room, settling into her designated seat with an air of what she hopes comes across as boredom. Perlman’s team seems to be returning from the recess rejuvenated and ready for a second round, like they’ve spent the last twenty minutes charting a new plan of attack.</p><p>Connie the stenographer walks back into the room and slides into her folding chair. She chews the gum in her mouth loudly and looks entirely unfazed by the whole ordeal. Surprisingly, Agatha finds she’s the one she wants to throttle the most at this moment.</p><p>Stephen gives them both what Agataha assumes he must think is a reassuring nod. She ignores him entirely. Peter’s chair creaks behind her like he’s bracing for whatever comes next.</p><p>It’s Shark Smile who takes the reins, flipping her manila folder back open with a flourish.</p><p>“I want to talk a bit about your separation and how it ties into this case, if we could. Stephen was rather adamant that the strain of your son’s death was the primary cause of your failed marriage, so we just want to confirm that.”</p><p>She delivers the statement like she’s a hostess telling them the wait for a table is thirty minutes and not a vile cunt of a woman begging for Agatha to hit her with her open palm. Even still, Agatha’s gut clenches and any nicotine left in her system does little to dull the buzz of her anxiety. She and Rio have managed to maintain a tentatively united front so far despite it all. Shark Smile seems to be having no more of that.</p><p>“Let’s start with something simple. When did you separate?”</p><p>“The spring after he died.”</p><p>“Four months and one week after his funeral.”</p><p>They answer at the same time, voices overlapping. Agatha clears her throat, tossing her hair over her shoulder. “Yes, four months and one week after. It was springtime then.”</p><p>She doesn’t look at Rio or Stephen. Shark Smile’s eyes dart back and forth between the two of them, the ghost of a smile on her lips.</p><p>“And who initiated the separation?” Agatha pauses. Rio does not.</p><p>“It was a mutual decision.”</p><p>In her mind’s eye she sees the pictures rattling on the walls from their screaming match. Hears the echo of the door as it slams.</p><p>“Would you say that your separation was caused by your son’s death?”</p><p>“I would definitely say it was related,” Agatha answers. She can’t let them pin this on Nicky, staining his memory with all of the ways they’ve ruined this. Rio’s fingers drum on the table top.</p><p>“Have the two of you maintained any contact since your separation?”</p><p>Sharp teeth and moans breathed into bedsheets. Nails biting into skin. Headlights in the snow.</p><p>“Not really,” Rio answers. Her fingers still on the table.</p><p>Shark Smile watches her for a moment, like she’s going to call Rio on the lie. For her part, Agatha wills her own face into a mask of like-minded indifference.</p><p>It was the right answer. The smart one, even. The nonchalance grates all the same.</p><p>“Okay,” Shark Smile hums. “So explain for me how you both ended up joining this lawsuit together. If there had been three years of more or less no contact.”</p><p>Agatha clears her throat to respond before realizing that she doesn’t actually know how Rio found out about the lawsuit. She’d never thought to ask. Half embarrassed, she shoots her eyes to Rio.</p><p>“I still get some of the local Boston papers and saw an ad about it there. I reached out to Stephen’s office and he was able to send me a more detailed breakdown of what Perlman had been doing. When I read it, I knew that Nicky’s story could help other children. And I knew that I wanted both of us to tell it.” She rubs a hand across the back of her neck, running her fingers between the collar of her shirt and her nape. “Agatha still lives at our, uh, the house. So I swung by and dropped the papers off.”</p><p>Rio’s voice tapers off as Shark Smile’s eyes fall back to the papers before her, like she’d stopped listening to Rio entirely. After an awkward beat she looks back up, returning the sickly sweet smile that Agatha had given her earlier.</p><p>“Ladies, I hear the story that you’re telling us, but it just doesn’t feel entirely believable to me.” She spreads her hands magnanimously in front of her. Big One huffs a half-grunt, half-laugh beside her.</p><p>“Let me lay out what the facts say, okay? I have here that for the past three or so years, Ms. Vidal averages 70 hours a week at work. A coworker once reported to human resources that you were spending at least two nights a week on the couch in your office to maximize output. Is that true?”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks darken slightly with the ghost of shame. “Well yes, but–”</p><p>“And Ms. Harkness,” Shark Smile continues over Rio’s protest without so much as a blink, “Stephen argued that your son’s death has left you sullen and, possibly, resentful of those around you.”</p><p>A faint note of sarcasm colors her words– enough to make Agatha seethe but not enough to call her on it. Agatha flashes her eyes to Stephen, but his focus remains firmly forward, his face stony.</p><p>“It seems, however, that these are problems you had long before your son’s passing. Arguably your entire life, actually. An anonymous source claims that you not only had a fraught relationship with your mother but that you have maintained very few– if any– friendships in your life.”</p><p>Agatha’s breathing picks up. She flexes and relaxes her fingers rhythmically in her lap, trying fruitlessly to not let the accusations ring in her skull. Agatha knows she’s always been something of a bitch and it’s never bothered her. But now she listens as this woman paints a picture of someone unforgivable. Unlovable.</p><p>She wants, desperately, for Shark Smile to be wrong. There was a woman here, once. There had to have been a woman before there was the beast wearing her skin.</p><p>“We have a since-deleted review from your firm’s Glassdoor page left by a former employee. We reached out to verify his claim and Mr. Bohner was more than glad to affirm that he felt you were a, quote, ‘narcissistic, man-hating lesbian bitch who saw everyone without a vagina as a second class citizen’. He went on to share with us that you fired him and other male employees despite it not being within your power to do so. Does this situation sound familiar to you?”</p><p>Agatha pauses to get one good, deep breath in. “I think I’m mostly just surprised that Bohner knows that many words and was able to string them together semi-coherently for you.”</p><p>Shark Smile narrows her eyes, clearly displeased with Agatha’s lack of shame. She takes another swing with her sledgehammer.</p><p>“What we’re saying is that it seems, based on the evidence, that whatever issues the two of you may have far predate the death of your son. Ms. Vidal was putting in long hours well before Nicholas passed. Ms. Harkness received complaints about her demeanor from neighbors and coworkers alike for years. Though it’s surely a tragedy that your son is no longer with us, your separation seems like an unrelated natural consequence of pre-existing problems.”</p><p>Beside her, Rio lets out an incredulous scoff and crosses her arms over her chest, stretching the fabric of her blazer over her biceps. In Agatha’s mind they’re in the car on the way back from Lilia’s. She asks, again, if they were always going to end up like this. Rio assures, again, that it would have to be over for that sort of question to matter.</p><p>“No,” Agatha blurts, briefly embarrassed before the satisfaction of catching Shark Smile’s shock alleviates it. “No, that’s not the truth. It was– we were happy. Before.” She swallows around the lump in her throat. “We wouldn’t be like this if he was still here.”</p><p>She hears Rio’s sharp inhalation but refuses to look. She’s exposed herself too much already.</p><p>Big One decides he’s had enough of being the supporting act and takes over once more, awkwardly patting Shark Smile’s forearm with his meaty hand like a placating father.</p><p>“You insist that your son’s death ruined your marriage, Ms. Harkness, but the truth is that you and Ms. Vidal aren’t even legally divorced. So even if you think you’re telling the truth by saying that his loss is what changed things, then it only goes to show that maybe it wasn’t quite as terrible as you’re trying to tell us it is.” He purses his lips like he’s disappointed in them. Agatha feels the rage begin to expand in her chest, growing into something unmanageable and dangerous.</p><p>“We can’t help but conclude that what we’re seeing today are two people– still married and joining a lawsuit together– concocting an over-exaggerated tale in hopes of getting a big payout. Whatever ailments Mr. Strange is trying to claim on your behalf seem to be only innate failings of your character.”</p><p>“Objection–”</p><p>But Big One has already been caught in the crosshairs of Rio’s hate-sharpened stare, the intensity overtaking whatever delayed help Stephen could try to offer. The pressure in the room seems to drop like a storm's coming when Rio draws in a breath, her voice a low snarl in her throat.</p><p>“You’re a pathetic, feebleminded man. You can’t try to paint me as a workaholic at the largest tech firm in the country <em> and</em> know that Agatha is a C-suite executive at an internationally successful agency <em> and </em> try to make this into some sort of cash grab.”</p><p>Shark Smile’s brow furrows. She opens her mouth and draws in a breath but Rio doesn’t waver, her eyes firmly locked on Big One.</p><p>“Are you not embarrassed? That you’re too incompetent to form a successful defense so instead you’re trying to diminish the character of two hardworking women who are doing their best to cope in the wake of unfathomable devastation? Because you’re one fuck up away from a defamation lawsuit yourself.”</p><p>Rio leans forward, shrinking the space between herself and the three figures across the table. She angles slightly to her left as she does so, placing her body more firmly between Agatha and the attorneys.</p><p>“Tell me– is it that you’re a sick fuck or that you’re just that stupid? Really. I’d love to know.”</p><p>Despite the gravity of the moment Agatha’s heart stutters briefly in her chest. Is that how Rio sees her? Something still whole, someone doing her best?</p><p>Big One does not dissolve into dust like Agatha hoped he would. “We’re just establishing a pattern here, Ms. Vidal,” he says. “Some of these behaviors don’t seem like any act of coping I've witnessed, more like long-held staples of your personalities.”</p><p>“Objection, speculation.”</p><p>“No need, Mr. Strange. We’re moving on.”</p><p>He flips to the back of his binder, leafing through the papers in the back pocket and pulling a few loose sheets out.</p><p>“You may recall that back when you agreed to use the Perlman Clinic to conceive your son, you were both asked to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. We have the records of those evaluations here.”</p><p>He takes a moment to shuffle through them, scanning the top few lines of each page for whatever it is that he’s looking for. Agatha chews on her bottom lip, fighting the overwhelming urge to take the papers from his hands and tear them to shreds. Any possible release from the anger boiling against the inside of her skin would be welcome at this point. If he tries to use the records to call her crazy, Agatha’s not sure she won’t do something rash.</p><p>He finds the paper he’s searching for at last, tapping the documents against the table to line the sheets up before continuing.</p><p>“Ms. Vidal, I have here your evaluation with the Perlman Clinic’s on-staff psychiatrist at the time. When asked if you had any major concerns about moving forward, you said, and I quote, ‘I’m scared that I’ll fuck this baby up somehow. I never really had a good example of what a parent might look like. I don’t want to ruin the parenting experience for Agatha, either, so I guess I’m scared in that regard too,’ end quote.”</p><p>Agatha turns at that, studying Rio’s profile. She’d known that Rio was nervous about being a mother having had no real mother herself, they both were. But to hear that Rio had been concerned about impacting Agatha’s experience? Her fingers twitch in her lap as she fights the urge to reach out.</p><p>Agatha had wanted to be a mother <em> because </em> Rio would be there to do it with her. Because the baby would be hers.</p><p>“You spoke in that evaluation about having concerns regarding your impact on your future child. Did those concerns include your own ambiguous family history?” Big One prods.</p><p>Rio’s jaw is still set with her earlier anger, her hands gripping her own arms where they’re crossed like she’s restraining herself from breaking Big One’s jaw.</p><p>“To an extent, yes. I wanted to do what was best for my family.”</p><p>Big One shifts like he’s going to continue down this path, but Shark Smile writes something rapidly on her own paper and slides it into Big One’s field of vision, tapping at it with her pen to get his attention. Agatha watches his eyes sweep over the words and light up with intrigue. He nods to Shark Smile and she slides the page back over.</p><p>“Ms. Vidal, I’d like to circle back from the quote we reviewed from your psychiatric evaluation. Would you say that many of your concerns about parenthood were surrounding your wife and her experience of motherhood?”</p><p>Rio’s brow furrows, unsure how to answer. “Yes,” she decides on. “It was important to me to support Agatha in the ways that I could since she would be the one carrying.”</p><p>“So would you say you were more worried about her feelings at any given point than you were about your actual child? Perhaps afraid you might trigger Ms. Harkness’... reactivity?”</p><p>Rio reels back as if slapped. Agatha clenches her jaw hard enough to crack a molar.</p><p>Rio was an incredible mother. She still is, even now. But at Shark Smile’s knowing smirk, Agatha can’t help but wonder if some aspect of what they’re implying could be true. A could dread slinks its way behind her ribs; maybe Agatha had detracted from Rio’s experience of motherhood and her time with Nicky. She queasily reflects on petty squabbles over feeding schedules and bedtime routines and TV limits that dragged into bigger blow outs at times.</p><p>But Rio doesn’t seem to be having similar thoughts. Instead, she looks Big One up and down like she’s astounded by how incredibly fucking stupid he is.</p><p>“I understand that you must think yourself to be some sort of god in this room– someone smarter than the people around you, at least. But I am going to talk now and you are going to listen. Repeat back to me what you’re going to do.”</p><p>Big One’s eyes narrow, a man clearly not used to being told what to do. He glances at Stephen as if his fellow man will come to his aid but Stephen stares blankly back.</p><p>“I am going to listen,” he grits out through clenched teeth.</p><p>“Ms. Vidal,” Rio adds.</p><p>Big One grips his pen so tightly that Agatha wonders if it’ll explode. He releases his hold gradually.</p><p>“I am going to listen, Ms. Vidal.”</p><p>Rio’s smile is all venom. “Good. What you’re failing miserably to comprehend, even hours into this shit show, is that Agatha is the sun of my life. I wasn’t <em> afraid </em> of Agatha, only desperate to give her even half of the joy that she had brought me. And Nicky wasn’t some footnote in our lives, either– not this pitstop on the way to some suburban wet dream that you seem to think we’re chasing. He’s <em> our son</em> and we love him. He brought us more joy than the human heart can reasonably hold. We’re here because the company that you’re currently representing took him from us.”</p><p>Big One’s response is immediate:</p><p>“I think you mean ‘was.’”</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>“You spoke about Ms. Harkness and your son in the present tense. I think you misspoke.”</p><p>“Are you always this big on semantics or is it only when you’re antagonizing the parents of dead children?” Agatha fires. Big One’s response is directed to Rio anyway.</p><p>“Ok, then let me ask you this Ms. Vidal– you said specifically that you weren’t afraid of your wife back then. Are you afraid of her now?”</p><p>In a moment so brief Agatha’s sure that nobody else notices, Rio falters. Somewhere behind her ribs, a light flickers out and dies.</p><p>“I can’t think of one reason that the answer to that question would be helpful in a case about the Perlman Clinic killing children with their negligence,” Rio replies smoothly. Stephen takes that as his cue.</p><p>“You know what, I think this is a good place to stop. We’ve done enough here today, don’t you all agree?”</p><p>Big One doesn’t respond at first, taking a prolonged pause to look back through the papers in his binder. Agatha holds her breath while he leans first to Wisp and then to Shark Smile, checking their work as well. Finally, he nods, painting an oversized smile on his face.</p><p>“Yeah, sure. We can be done. Thanks for your time here ladies.”</p><p>Agatha stands as if she’s in a trance, ignoring Big One’s outstretched hand and Stephen calling for her to wait. She steps past everyone, pushing out of the stuffy room and down the hall, picking a direction at random. She hears the rustle of Rio moving to follow her before she’s pulled back by Stephen and Peter, surely hoping to have some sort of debrief.</p><p>After aimlessly wondering down one silent hallway and then another, Agatha finds a women's restroom. She slips in and beelines directly for the row of sinks, turning on a tap halfway down and splashes cold water over her face. Her ears ring like she’s just narrowly avoided a fatal explosion. She wills her body to calm down lest she succumb to the primal urge to beat Wisp senseless in the parking lot.</p><p>When her skin has sufficiently cooled she reaches for the dispenser, pulling out a paper towel and patting at her face gently. She allows herself the honest thought of how terrible that deposition had been to endure. Smooths it over with the consolation that she can go home now and forget that the whole goddamn thing ever happened, drink an entire bottle of wine, and stay inside for the rest of her life.</p><p>For a second, this tactic works. She feels her breathing start to even back out, some of the tremor slipping from her frame.</p><p>The door glides silently open. The sharp clack of Shark Smile’s heels on the linoleum ricochets through the otherwise silent bathroom, the sound still echoing when she stops at the sink closest to the door. She looks entirely unruffled, not a single wrinkle etched into her skirt suit despite the hours they’d just spent sitting in a stuffy room.</p><p>A single water droplet slides down Agatha’s temple and curls over her throat. A spot she missed.</p><p>Agatha stands entirely still as Shark Smile washes her hands rigorously like the deposition had sullied her somehow. She wrings a paper towel over her damp wrists, tossing it in the trash and leaning in toward the mirror to dab at her unblemished makeup with a dainty finger.</p><p>“You know,” she starts, her vocal fry raking over Agatha’s frayed nerves. She doesn’t shift her eyes from her own reflection. “I have to give it to you. It’s really impressive that you were able to keep her around for so long before she realized you’re fucking crazy. Women that hot and smart can usually sniff that sort of thing out from a mile away, but you must run a good con.”</p><p>Shark Smile leans away from the mirror, tilting her face from side to side like she’s checking her makeup from every angle. “Or I guess maybe she <em> did </em> know and the whole dead kid thing was just the perfect out. Either way,” she shrugs, finally turning to meet Agatha’s eyes, “have a nice day Ms. Harkness.”</p><p>When she disappears once more and the door swings shut behind her, Agatha wonders if Shark Smile had been holding a gun in her hand and had shot her in the chest when she wasn’t looking.</p><p>Agatha has run many, many cons remorselessly– swindling co-eds in the bars around campus so that she and Rio never paid for a single drink, powering her way to the top of a multilevel marketing scheme so quickly that the other women gave up, convincing the manager of her local grocery store that she’s a childhood friend of the CEO to get a hefty discount. But what she had with Rio was real, wasn’t it? Surely Rio couldn't believe it had been fake even for a moment?</p><p>To Agatha it had been real. Probably the most honest thing she’s ever done is love Rio.</p><p>But Shark Smile’s words stick into her skin like brambles, stinging long after she’s gone. It’s the final straw of this godforsaken day– there are too many sharp things prying into Agatha and the bleeding won’t stop. She can’t make it stop. If she were to look in the mirror she would surely find something half-dead and mangled.</p><p>Agatha just needs to make it to her car. She takes as deep of a breath as she can manage and pushes back out of the bathroom, repeating the words in her head like a mantra as she searches for a stairwell.</p><p>
<em> I just need to get back to the car. Keep it together until you’re in the car, Agatha. </em>
</p><p>She finds the door to the stairs and grips the railing with a shaking hand as she descends, her vision tunneling down to the step ahead of her. Every step toward her car feels like dragging her feet through wet cement. Tears pound at the back of her eyes and her mouth waters like she’s going to vomit.</p><p>In her head, Big One holds up the pictures of her twelve year old body– battered and bruised– and asks if she did the same to Nicky. Shark Smile congratulates her on tricking Rio into loving her. Rio hesitates when they ask if she’s afraid of Agatha.</p><p>At long last she reaches the black sedan, wrapping her fingers around the scalding door handle. <em> I just need to get into the car. That’s it. </em></p><p>“Agatha?” Rio calls from somewhere behind her.</p><p>Nothing else. Only her name- a question, a statement, a plea and a prayer.</p><p>A key sliding perfectly into the rusted deadbolt inside of her chest and twisting until it clicks and falls open.</p><p>Agatha breaks.</p>

<p>The first thing Agatha registers is that the sheets are scratchy– some sort of rough, store brand cotton blend wrapped around her limbs. Her pulse hammers in her sinuses and she can feel the way the skin around her eyes is puffy and hot, her nose residually clogged.</p><p>When at last Agatha plucks up the courage to blink her eyes open, her surroundings are entirely unrecognizable. Agatha’s in the middle of a full sized bed in a room she’s certainly never seen before. The walls are a dull, faded grey. A single print of a flower sits in a frame on the far wall, but the room is otherwise bare. The only familiarity is the smell. Subtle, but there.</p><p>The curtains are drawn over the lone window and Agatha couldn’t even begin to guess what time it is. She sits up, blinking her crusted eyes a few times until they clear. A cup of water waits on the lone nightstand to her right. Agatha reaches out for it, taking a tentative sip and gathering her thoughts.</p><p>There are flashes– bits and pieces that she pulls together in hopes of solving the puzzle before her.</p><p>The parking lot outside of the law firm. Rio’s voice. Burning concrete digging into her knees.</p><p>The time-worn passenger seat of the Subaru, safe and familiar. Careful hands dragging the seatbelt across her chest and clicking it into place. The cool AC blowing an errant strand of her hair against the sensitive skin beneath her ear.</p><p>There weren’t words, she doesn’t think– at least none that had reached her ears. Only a deafening static, like the world itself had cracked in two. Only a steady stream of tears covering her cheeks and throat and bleeding into the neckline of her dress.</p><p>Walking into a nice building somewhere on the far side of town with a stale but clean smell and chrome elevator doors. Steady fingers guiding her down a hall, gently lowering her onto a too-soft mattress and lifting the sheets to her chin. Brushing the hair from her face. And then, nothing.</p><p>Agatha takes another sweep of the room. This must be where Rio lives, then. As soon as she thinks it she knows it’s the truth, settling uncomfortably in the pit of her stomach. The space feels entirely impersonal, transitional in the way that a hotel room would be.</p><p>She rises from the bed and pulls the curtain back from the window, letting the early evening light settle over the room. Agatha shifts her shoulders where the zipper of her dress digs into her back, realizing she’s still in her outfit from the deposition. At the same moment she turns back to the bed and notices a neat bundle set in the corner, undisturbed by her fitful rest.</p><p>Agatha picks up the top item and looks at the one beneath it, breathing through the small shaft of light that pierces through the gloom in her chest at the sight. It’s a pair of basketball shorts and a t-shirt that could have belonged to either one of them, though it’s been too long now to say for sure. One of the freebies that clubs and sports teams hand out in the early days of the fall semester.</p><p>Shedding her dress clumsily, Agatha steps into the ensemble. She feels at once better and more unsure of herself. Her dress and blazer had offered her a sense of fortitude, however fragile. Though when she looks down at the rumpled green heap on the floor, she figures this might honestly be better.</p><p>Agatha dips her nose below the collar of the shirt, inhaling deeply. It smells like Rio. Everything here does, really. Where, then, is the woman herself?</p><p>She pushes open the door to the bedroom, finding herself at the end of a short hallway that opens out into what must constitute the rest of the apartment. Agatha quietly pads across the floor and stops in the hallway’s mouth.</p><p>To her right, a sparsely furnished living room gives way to a wall composed entirely of windows that overlook downtown, some of the street lights just beginning to flicker on. To her left lies a grey and white kitchen, so small that Agatha wonders how one person could even comfortably move in it.</p><p>There’s no dining table, only a row of three cheap looking barstools tucked up underneath the counter that separates the kitchen from the rest of the open space.</p><p>Rio sits at the farthest one, still in her deposition suit sans blazer and scribbling away in a notebook. Her sleeves are pushed up and the top three buttons of her blouse are undone, her tie tossed somewhere out of sight, but Agatha still feels wildly underdressed in comparison. Like a child playing at being something more.</p><p>She doesn’t seem to have noticed Agatha yet, her brow furrowed and her back hunched sharply over the pages. Agatha swallows past the scratch she feels in her throat.</p><p>“Where are we?”</p><p>Rio jumps slightly, her pen catching on the page. She smooths herself out quickly, running a hand through her newly shorn hair and looking to Agatha with a quiet sort of caution. Her eyes trail over Agatha’s form, as if she’s checking for visible injuries.</p><p>“My apartment.”</p><p>Rio pauses. She seems to be looking for the right thing to say and Agatha wonders if Rio’s trying to decide whether to be angry with her for her outburst or disappointed by the way the deposition went.</p><p>Either way, Agatha takes the chance to step more fully out of the hall, taking in the apartment in full. Her observation from the bedroom still stands– everything here is entirely impersonal, like it came fully furnished down to the shitty barstools and the faux-leather couch that looks squeaky and uncomfortable. The only thing adorning the walls are the chips in the paint, like Rio got here only yesterday. For all Agatha knows, she did.</p><p>She spares a glance to the wall to her right expecting more of the same. The TV and its stand are unsurprisingly dull, but a single framed picture rests precariously on the edge of the wooden surface. Agatha steps closer, squinting down to see it.</p><p>It’s a photo of Rio and Nicky, one from when he was maybe six or seven months old. Rio had come home with a dinosaur costume and dressed him in it at record speed, holding him aloft with an exuberant sort of pride. Even all these years later, Rio’s smile is big and bright and absurd in the glossy print. Agatha remembers giggling behind the camera as she took it, unable to maintain a straight face as she told Rio he needed to wear actual clothes.</p><p>Agatha stares for what feels like a long time before Rio’s voice reaches her ears, pulling her focus back behind her.</p><p>“I can take you home, if you want. It was just easier to get you here earlier.”</p><p>Agatha thinks about home and how it was made for a family– they made it for a family– and now it’s just her in that glorified prison cell. That hollowed out feeling comes back to her gut.</p><p>“No, that’s alright.”</p><p>As if to perform nonchalance, she glides to the other side of the counter and takes a seat, leaving one lonely stool between them. Rio seems to accept this and goes back to her writing, albeit slower. Agatha thinks it would maybe be better if she would just yell and kick her out rather than settle into this limbo.</p><p>Agatha takes a deep breath, taking stock of her headache. The overhead lights in the kitchen are harsh, reflecting off of the fake marble tile and burning through her eyelids. The faint smell of cigarette smoke still clings to Rio’s clothes through the haze of her perfume. </p><p>A slightly cool mug of tea sits on the counter next to Rio’s left hand and she silently scoots it until it’s more firmly settled in the no man’s land of the counter between them, never stopping her writing. Agatha reaches out a pinky, looping it through the handle and pulling the mug the rest of the way to herself. She takes a sip, graciously refusing to flinch at the less than pleasant temperature.</p><p>Agatha wonders if maybe she was wrong to decline Rio’s offer to go home. Maybe she’s overstaying her welcome here, encroaching on a space that was never meant for her.</p><p>She takes another sip of the tea, holding the lukewarm liquid in her mouth. Agatha hates this feeling. She’s exposed, vulnerable in a way that she’s tried so hard not to be. Flayed open first by the deposition and then carved up further by the subsequent breaking of the dam inside of her that she can only half remember. Had she said anything embarrassing that she just can’t recall? Had Shark Smile’s observation in the bathroom been true? Is Rio just humoring her?</p><p>Agatha swallows, her knee beginning the bounce as her anxiety mounts. She flicks her eyes over to the entryway, noting her own heels by the door. Maybe she should just go.</p><p>Rio clicks her pen and closes the notebook in front of her, tilting her head from side to side to crack her neck. She turns to Agatha, seemingly unaware of her internal plight.</p><p>“Are you okay with stir fry for dinner?”</p><p>Agatha wants to ruminate on the implications of such an utterly mundane question at a time like this, but her stomach rumbles loudly before her brain has the time. She nods once as Rio cracks the ghost of a half smile, offering her a mock salute before hopping down from her stool and setting about making dinner in her undersized kitchen.</p><p>For a while, Agatha watches silently as Rio moves through the space with ease, pulling vegetables from the fridge and various spices from a cabinet. She pushes her sleeves up nearly to her biceps when she brings out the cutting board and begins slicing the vegetables into thin slivers, careful to protect her white blouse.</p><p>The motions of it all are so familiar that it makes Agatha ache. Makes her wish that someone would invent some sort of fucked up torture that would hurt enough so that she could finally be absolved of her crimes and allowed to enjoy small nice things again. As it is, she goes on aching.</p><p>Rio drops the vegetables into a hot pan on the stove, seasoning them meticulously. With her back turned, Agatha feels safe enough to try using her voice again.</p><p>“Why didn’t you say anything before about working all that overtime?”</p><p>Rio freezes for a second, her shoulders lifting almost to her ears before dropping again. Agatha watches her shrug dismissively.</p><p>“We don’t really say anything about anything, do we?”</p><p>She’s right, of course. Agatha’s cheeks heat slightly with the call out and she contents herself to letting Rio finish cooking in silence.</p><p>Rio clicks the burner off when she’s done, pulling down two bowls from another cabinet and filling them both before grabbing chopsticks and walking towards the living room. Agatha trails awkwardly behind her, perching on the edge of the couch. She was right– it is squeaky and uncomfortable, the cushions steadfastly maintaining their shape instead of molding around her.</p><p>Agatha leaves a space between them again, not reaching for her bowl on the coffee table until Rio picks hers up. If Rio shifts a bit closer when she settles back against the couch, Agatha doesn’t say anything.</p><p>The apartment is silent save for Rio blowing quietly on the noodles before taking a bite. After she swallows, there’s a pause.</p><p>“Do you want to talk about it?”</p><p>It reminds Agatha of the car ride back from Lilia’s party. She resists the urge to ask back <em> which part? </em></p><p>“Not really,” she says instead.</p><p>“Alright.” Rio picks up the remote, turning on the TV and navigating to some nature documentary about the ocean. Agatha picks at her food while the opening credits play, trying to push down the burgeoning feeling that something terrible and inevitable was gunning for her at full force. </p><p>On the screen, a group of whales swirl around one another, blotches of black and white against an endless blue backdrop.</p><p><em> Orcas are a matriarchal species, </em> the narrator tells her in his fucked up little accent. <em> Male orcas stay with their mothers for their entire lives, their whole existence revolving around the wellbeing of the pod. </em></p><p>The audio behind the voiceover isn’t quite music the way that Agatha would define it, but it’s something close. Voices, calling. A haunting melody.</p><p><em> Each pod has a language entirely their own, </em> funny voice man explains as the voices reach a crescendo, blending together in a symphony all their own. <em> They sing to one another to communicate</em>. The documentary cuts to a clip of a lone orca, the camera pulling away slowly until he’s nothing more than a black dot adrift in an empty sea.</p><p>
<em> If you tried to split a pod up– to put them in an environment with orcas from other pods and not their own– they wouldn’t know how to speak to one another. Their songs would fall on deaf ears, the once meaningful ballads now meaningless without their families around to hear them. </em>
</p><p>“The regulation of gene expression is called epigenetics,” Agatha says, the words bubbling up her throat and out of her with so much force that the loudness of them makes her flinch.</p><p>Rio reaches for the remote beside her to mute the TV but Agatha can’t make herself hold the words in. She can’t look away from the whales on the screen, the whole room bathed in an eerie blue glow now that the sun has set. So long as she keeps her focus forward, she can make it through this.</p><p>“It’s influenced by the carrier’s body, whether the egg belongs to them or not.”</p><p>Rio sets her bowl down on the coffee table, leaning forward and running her fingers softly through the back of Agatha’s hair where it falls along her spine. “Agatha, you don’t have to–”</p><p>But Agatha can’t stop now, not when the words have lived at the back of her tongue for so long. Not when she needs to get them out of her body before they eat her alive once and for all.</p><p>“So it was never going to matter if the gene came from you or from the donor. Or if the gene never existed at all. Or if we’d used my egg. I was– as long as any part of me touched him it was going to end up like this.” Agatha’s voice cracks. When she draws in a breath it feels like raking her lungs over broken glass. She rushes the rest of it out.</p><p>“My mother was right and there’s always been something rotten in me and not even all of your good could outweigh my bad. And I killed him and I’m sorry. I’m so, so sorry.”</p><p>Agatha knows she’s apologizing not only to Rio but to Nicky, too. For breaking their family and then taking a sledgehammer to the shattered remains. For having hands that only know how to bruise; for having a body that only knows how to take no matter how badly she wants to give.</p><p>Rio’s fingers tighten in her hair, clinging more than soothing. Agatha knows she’s crying again, clutching desperately at the dinner bowl in her hands for dear life.</p><p>There is it, then. The awful truth that has all but burnt her down to ash, laid bare between them both. And now that Rio knows, she can leave once and for all. Can let go of all of the hurt that Agatha has inflicted on her and the twisted idea that <em> she’d </em> killed Nicky and walk away, finally free of this shared burden.</p><p>But Rio doesn’t leave. She takes a wet, shaky breath and reaches out, pulling Agatha backwards onto her lap so that they’re pressed back to front. Rio pries the bowl from Agatha’s rigid fingers and sets it on the coffee table with her own, wrapping her strong arms around the curve of Agatha’s waist as if to hold her still.</p><p>Agatha can feel Rio’s heartbeat where her chest is pressed between her shoulderblades. She still can’t look. It would be too much to have this conversation and look Rio in the eye too. Agatha knows that this makes her a coward– knows that she always has been– and does it anyway.</p><p>She leans her temple against the side of Rio’s head, feeling the air rush past her eyelashes when Rio exhales through her nose. The room falls silent again as Rio lets the weight of Agatha’s words settle, taking them in. On the TV, the orcas circumvent a whaling boat.</p><p>“If you didn’t blame me, then why are we doing this? What is any of it for?”</p><p>Agatha can hear the hurt in her voice and knows that she caused it. Knows it must only be the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>She tries to pull away, lifting her head, but Rio’s arms tighten around her stomach, both keeping her close and demanding an answer.</p><p>What is there left to lie for, anyway? There’s no false sense of dignity for Agatha to protect, no bravado to maintain. She may as well pull the knife out from where she’s kept it sheathed in both of their sides, letting the blood come as it may.</p><p>“I never blamed you for his death, and…it wasn’t fair for me to let you think that I did.  I just couldn’t understand how it seemed like it was all so simple for you when I was just <em> stuck. </em>But by the time I realized what I had become– what I had done to you– you were already gone. And I had ruined so much of your life already that I thought that if I just doubled down and pushed you away then you’d at least have a chance to be free from that. From me.</p><p>“When you wouldn’t just walk away and save yourself, I was pissed that you could be so fucking stupid. I wanted to punish you for it, and I did.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice breaks, the words burning in her throat as they come up. She forces them out anyway. “You deserve to move on, Rio. You deserve a full life.”</p><p>It’s harsh, maybe, but it’s the truth. Agatha had seen that she was something irreparably broken and figured that Rio must have seen it too. Had thought about fixing things only to realize that she’d simply break them again, even when Rio continued to show up. Even when Wanda and Lilia and Alice and Jen seemed to hold out some impossible hope that Agatha could one day become whole again.</p><p>Rio turns her face to press her nose into Agatha’s hair, inhaling deeply before pulling her face just far enough away to tuck the unruly strands behind Agatha’s ear. She uses her hold on Agatha’s waist to turn her body in kind, angling them towards one another before lifting both hands to cup her face.</p><p>Agatha hesitantly lifts her eyes to meet Rio’s, expecting rage. She finds only tenderness waiting for her, something cracked open and raw.</p><p>“How could you believe that? Any of it?”</p><p>Agatha watches as Rio’s pupils dart between her own, searching. Her eyes glimmer with unshed tears.</p><p>“There isn’t a full life for me without you in it. I tried to stop loving you–” Agatha’s blood freezes in her veins “-and it damn near killed me.” Rio’s hold on her face tightens, her hands holding Agatha’s skull in place. Agatha lifts her own hands to hold loosely onto Rio’s wrists. “Stop running away, stop deciding what I can and can’t take, and stop treating me like shit on purpose. Just let me be here,” Rio all but begs.</p><p>In response, a fresh wave of tears floods Agatha’s face, her breath coming as a choked sob. A single thought is spared to the amount she’s cried today alone, because holy fuck, since when were there this many tears in her body to begin with?</p><p>But mostly, she’s clinging desperately to the shred of something rotted still inside of her– the part of her that knows that she doesn’t deserve forgiveness. Because the other shoe is certainly going to drop and now that they’ve come this far it’s certainly going to hurt all the more.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t realize that she’s squeezed her eyes shut until Rio’s thumbs dig into the curve of her jaw. “Agatha, sweetheart, look at me,” she coos. And Agatha does. How could she not?</p><p>Rio shifts one hand to wipe Agatha’s tears away, palms still cradling her face. “Yes, you hurt me. I hurt you back. And we still have a lot of shit to work through. I know that.” Agatha’s gut twists. “But there is nothing wrong with you, do you hear me? You are a good person. You were the best mother. You did not kill our son and neither did I. Sometimes boys die.”</p><p>The look in Rio’s eyes is fierce, like she can press the truth through Agatha’s skin and into her brain with only her words and her willpower. </p><p>Agatha wants, more than anything, to believe Rio. To just let her be right, no matter how loud that vile, hissing voice in her skull screams that all of this is Agatha’s fault. That she’ll only mess this up again. But Rio is still looking at her with those big golden-brown eyes and holding her face. Rio’s heartbeat is still thumping away– against Agatha’s shoulder now– steady and strong and true.</p><p>Agatha wants, more than anything, to believe Rio. And so she does.</p><p>She gives a barely there nod that she’s sure Rio sees if only because her hands are on her face before leaning forward and resting their foreheads together. For a moment, it’s all that they do, breathing the same air in and out and existing in this moment. One of Agatha’s hands drops from Rio’s wrist to curl into the front of Rio’s blouse and press against the skin just below her collarbone, grounding and quiet and safe. When had she last felt safe?</p><p>There is more to be said, Agatha knows. But for once there is the promise of more time, of another chance to find the right words. For now, she tilts her head slightly, nudging Rio’s nose with her own and connecting their lips.</p><p>Rio’s inhale is sharp before she settles into the kiss, keeping it slow and gentle. Agatha lets her– lets Rio guide her until she’s straddling her hips, lets her leave warm kisses across her damp cheeks and down her throat, lets her brush a warm palm under her t-shirt.</p><p>They spend what could be minutes or hours just like that, intertwined on the couch, slow hands traveling in the pursuit of remapping familiar terrain. There is no rush when Rio drags her tongue along the roof of Agatha’s mouth, nothing frantic when Agatha unbuttons Rio’s blouse the rest of the way with deft fingers. Only familiarity and safety and the sure, solid feeling of coming home.</p><p>Agatha is bare from the waist up and Rio wears only her bra and slacks by the time Rio picks her up and walks them both back to the bedroom, laying Agatha down on the sheets like she’s something precious. Moonlight illuminates the room as Agatha watches Rio shed her bra and pants. She shimmies the basketball shorts down her own hips, reaching back out to close the unnecessary gap between them. Rio gives her that soft, lopsided smile before coming willingly, settling her weight over Agatha.</p><p>Agatha’s not sure which of them breathes the sigh of relief when their bare skin connects once more, but it doesn’t matter. How could anything else matter now when she finally gets to have Rio like this again– soft and open and unafraid? Nobody is crafting some clever dig, neither of them are armed. Rio’s tongue is soft and kind as it trails down Agatha’s throat and across her chest, flicking over a nipple before sucking it between her lips.</p><p>Agatha’s back arches from the mattress, her hand flying instinctively into Rio’s hair. She weaves her fingers into the locks but doesn’t pull, letting herself be taken. Giving herself over to Rio’s steadfast mercy.</p><p>Rio gives the same treatment to her neglected nipple, working Agatha up with her maddeningly slow, precise touch. When finally her mouth starts a descent across Agatha’s ribs and down her stomach, Agatha makes a mangled sound in the back of her throat, her hand tightening ever so slightly in Rio’s hair.</p><p>Rio raises her head in an instant, shooting a concerned look her way and scanning Agatha’s face rapidly.</p><p>“Do you want to stop?”</p><p>Her concern makes something warm bloom in Agatha’s chest, though her cheeks darken in embarrassment.</p><p>“No, baby, I just–” Agatha wets her lips with her tongue, watching the concern on Rio’s face soften into confusion, “--I want to see you, that’s all.”</p><p>The look that crosses Rio’s face almost cracks Agatha in half all over again, but she doesn’t flinch away from it. Instead, she drinks it in as Rio rises, all the way until she leans in to kiss Agatha again with a softness that borders on reverence.</p><p>“I’m right here Aggie,” Rio murmurs against her lips.</p><p>Agatha’s intended response turns into a gasp as Rio’s fingers finally slip between her thighs. It feels so good that she can’t bring herself to be annoyed by the cocky grin that the noise elicits, arching further into the touch. When Rio slides two fingers into her, all the while whispering soft praise into her ear, Agatha feels her mind go blissfully blank. The world is reduced to the pleasure that Rio has always known how to wring from her, the soothing cadence of her voice, and the presence of her face mere inches above Agatha's own.</p><p>Agatha cums with Rio’s breath in her mouth and Rio’s name on her lips. She feels a bead of sweat drip from her temple and down past her ear before Rio’s lips follow it a moment later.</p><p>“My pretty girl,” Rio whispers, her fingers still moving slightly against Agatha’s fluttering walls, “you were so good for me. So beautiful.”</p><p>Agatha’s lashes flutter against her cheeks of their own accord. She drags her hand from the nape of Rio’s nack and down towards her breast, palm lingering over her heartbeat. Agatha tilts her face up, brushing her lips over Rio’s in the ghost of a kiss.</p><p>“Can I touch you? Please?” She asks, voice raw. Rio’s jaw works as she swallows, a shaky exhale passing her lips and fanning over Agatha’s. Rio nods, pulling her fingers out of Agatha slowly and settling on her side on the mattress.</p><p>Agatha rises onto her forearm, gently pushing at Rio’s shoulder until she lays on her back in a reversal of their position from before. Agatha takes her time, kissing Rio indulgently before burning a path with her lips over Rio’s jaw and throat, nibbling and sucking lightly as she goes. It’s not enough to bruise, just enough to draw out Rio’s whimpers and sighs and take her apart bit by bit.</p><p>She continues her ministrations, working her mouth up the other side of Rio’s throat, sucking her earlobe between her lips and flicking her tongue over the flesh before pulling back. Agatha tilts her head lower, pressing her nose to the hollow of Rio’s throat and inhaling deeply before laving her tongue over the same spot, dragging the muscle down toward her chest.</p><p>When Rio finally begins to squirm beneath her, Agatha shifts her weight to bring a thigh between Rio’s spread legs, reveling in the full throated moan that she earns with the first drag upward. Rio’s head falls back when Agatha repeats the motion, freeing up new real estate beneath her jaw. Agatha keeps an unhurried rhythm, flexing her quad and dragging the muscle against Rio’s dripping sex while she worships her face and throat and tits with her lips and tongue, delighting in the steady stream of sounds coming from the woman beneath her.</p><p>Agatha picks up the pace just before Rio’s orgasm crashes through her, watching with awestruck joy as her whole body siezes in ecstasy. Agatha slows back down but doesn’t fully stop yet, waiting for Rio’s lust-blown eyes to open back up into her own. When they do, it’s like the sun has finally returned after so, so long spent in agonizing darkness.</p><p>She feels tears well in her eyes once more but leans in to plant a kiss against Rio’s cheek before they can fall, pulling her face back just far enough to meet Rio’s eyes.</p><p>“Hi,” Agatha whispers. Rio rewards her with that lopsided grin.</p><p>“Hi.”</p><p>Rio reaches up with a shaky hand, tucking Agatha’s hair back behind her ear again before catching her earlobe between her fingers, tugging slightly. “Will you stay?” Her voice is no more than a whisper.</p><p>Affection and guilt swell in Agatha’s heart in equal measure. “Yeah. If that’s okay.”</p><p>In lieu of a verbal response Rio wraps her arms around Agatha, pulling her down and wrestling them both until their heads are resting on the pillows and the blankets are more or less draped over them. All the while she holds Agatha against her chest, making the whole process leagues more difficult than it needed to be. Agatha lets her, giggling when Rio has to pause to push her sweaty hair out of her face more than once and the sheets get caught around their ankles.</p><p>At last, the room goes quiet save for their breaths that come in tandem. It passes through her sluggish thoughts, but Agatha doesn’t give voice to Shark Smile’s accusation. She was wrong, anyway. Agatha was right– being with Rio is the truest thing she’s ever done. The easiest thing she’s ever done. In her mind, Agatha imagines shooting Shark Smile between the eyes with a nail gun. She breathes a sigh of content.</p><p>“I missed you.” Rio’s voice is quiet, almost shy.</p><p>And though they’ve had sex as recently as a month ago and saw each other last week, Agatha knows exactly what she means.</p><p>“I missed you too,” she confesses against the skin of Rio’s chest. Listens as Rio's heartbeat picks up slightly beneath her ear.</p><p>Somewhere, on a cosmic level, something vital settles back into place.</p><p>For the first time in years, Agatha sleeps soundly.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha wriggles her toes deeper into the sand absentmindedly, settling further into her beach chair once her feet find a cooler layer to rest in. Beside her, Wanda is talking. Telling a story, maybe, about something that she has going on at work or something entirely out of pocket that Sharon had said while she waves her sunscreen-slathered arm in the air. Either way, Agatha isn’t listening.</p><p>Her eyes are fixed firmly on the blue-grey water, watching Rio’s arms flex and stretch as she rotates like a crane in a half circle over and over again, lifting Nicky and the twins one by one and tossing them into the water. It’s a calm day with waves that break in a murmur rather than a roar but still Rio watches them all with a casually careful eye, keeping the boys safe while they have their fun.</p><p>The view shimmers slightly, glimmering with an unnatural sheen of joy. Agatha knows, then, that she’s dreaming. Even more so, she knows this is a memory. Each beat plays out as it should– Wanda catches on, laughing at her blatant ogling and hitting Vision’s arm to point it out to him. Rio drags the boys and herself out of the water, and when Agatha sees the sun hit her skin and the water running in rivulets down the planes of her stomach, the heat that she feels has nothing to do with her slow blooming sunburn. Rio walks back up to their chairs and finds Agatha still staring, lets that cocky smirk grace her lips before she leans in to whisper–</p><p>A soft sigh reaches her ears and the memory/dream comes to a halt. Agatha is awake and deeply, annoyingly aware of the sunlight breaking through the blinds. Aware of a body, solid and warm, tucked against her front. When she opens her eyes she receives visual confirmation that she is, in fact, the big spoon and Rio is sleeping peacefully in her arms.</p><p>Agatha lazily studies Rio’s face, unguarded in sleep. She looks younger here, more trusting. Agatha is reminded of the Rio who would fall asleep curled up on the floor of their study room during finals week and of the Rio who never made it all the way through a movie without passing out.</p><p>Versions of Rio that Agatha hadn't taken her knife to, she thinks. Something hard and unpleasant settles in her chest, a voice that slithers in from the back of her mind with a reminder that she does not, as it stands, deserve nice things. A reminder that not all has been forgiven.</p><p>Agatha stews in the feeling, her breathing picking up to match pace with the rush of her thoughts. She’s considering pulling away when she feels a hand cover the back of her own, locking their fingers together over Rio’s bare stomach and holding fast. Agatha’s breath catches in the quiet of the room.</p><p>“Good morning,” Rio rasps in her gravelly, sleep-thick voice. Had she been standing, Agatha would have fallen to her knees at the sound.</p><p>It’s absurd, really, how love floods the system after the dam holding it back finally breaks.</p><p>“Hi.”</p><p>For a moment, that’s all there is. Agatha waits while Rio finishes waking up fully, stretching languidly before turning in the cradle of Agatha’s arms so that their noses are nearly brushing. The smile she offers is small but real as she tangles their feet together beneath the blankets.</p><p>“I’m glad you’re still here,” she whispers. Honest. Unguarded.</p><p>Agatha swallows past the lump in her throat. “Me too.”</p><p>“I do, unfortunately, have work today though,” Rio says with a grimace. Agatha closes her eyes with a groan, realizing that it’s still a normal Wednesday and that the world has not stopped spinning. She had meant to handle some things yesterday evening after the deposition, but that clearly had not gone to plan. </p><p>Agatha cracks her eyes back open with a look that can only be described as mournful. “Me too.”</p><p>Rio bites her lip to stifle her laugh before finally detangling herself from their nest, stretching one last time before pulling herself from the bed. </p><p>“I’m gonna hop in the shower,” she says, absently tapping her phone on the nightstand to check the time. Agatha nods, watching as Rio rounds the bed. The scene is at once familiar and foreign, like Agatha could recite this script from memory but the stage dressing has come from a different play entirely. Rio hesitates for a half second before leaning down and pressing a soft, chaste kiss to Agatha’s lips. Agatha feels the balloon of tension in her chest deflate slightly, some of the pressure lifted from her rib cage.</p><p>She watches Rio disappear and hears the door down the hall open and shut, followed by the telltale sign of the showerhead turning on. Agatha contemplates the merits of joining her but ultimately decides it would probably be too much too quickly. She presses the heels of her hands into her eyes, certain she’s getting whiplash from how violently her thoughts are swinging from one extreme to the other.</p><p>Yesterday had been a lot. Yes, they slept together and yes, Rio said that Nicky’s death wasn’t Agatha’s fault. But nothing was magically erased in the process, no matter how badly Agatha wishes it was. There’s still more to be said, more hurt simmering somewhere on a back burner waiting to be addressed. Just the same, there’s a lightness that wasn’t there before. A tentative hope for something better. </p><p>When she finally follows suit and rises from the bed, Agatha eyes both the clothes that Rio had set out for her yesterday and her dress still on the floor in the corner, pondering which look would feel less in tune with a walk of shame. She remembers, too, that her car is still parked at the Perlman lawyers’ firm. The moment she realizes she’ll probably have to ask Wanda to drive her to get it back, Agatha suppresses the urge to flop back down onto the mattress, desperate for as little evidence of her breakdown as possible to exist in the world.</p><p>In the end, she pulls the t-shirt and basketball shorts back on and borrows a pair of slides from Rio’s closet. Agatha collects her dress, blazer, heels, and underwear in her arms and piles them onto the couch while she roots around in Rio’s kitchen, listening to the sounds of Rio traveling back and forth between the bedroom and bathroom while she gets ready for work.</p><p>Rio emerges from the hallway just as Agatha finds a grocery bag under the sink and shoves her clothes unceremoniously inside to be dealt with at home. Agatha lets her eyes rake over Rio’s form, dressed in a green short sleeve blouse and black slacks. Her blocky heeled pumps are still in her hand, waiting to be put on.</p><p>Agatha knows that she saw Rio naked truly less than an hour ago. Knows this, and still feels herself starting to salivate at the sight of her in her professional ensemble. It’s as if Agatha has spent so long redirecting her emotions into anger and hate that she didn’t realize that so much of said emotion was this unbridled lust.</p><p>Still, she’s trying not to rush things or send herself spiraling one way or another with mistimed action, so Agatha simply tucks her hair behind her ear with her free hand and knots the grocery bag shut while pretending she wasn’t slack-jawed staring. As it is, Rio notices anyway and gives her a smirk laced with amusement.</p><p>Agatha clears her throat, looking pointedly past Rio and out through the living room windows. “I called an Uber to take me back to the house. I’ll be out of your hair in a second,” she offers lamely.</p><p>Rio’s bare feet shuffle awkwardly as she shifts her weight, the pumps swaying in her hand. “I could’ve driven you.”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. “It’s on the wrong side of town, dumbass. You’d be late for work if you did that.”</p><p>“Okay, well this is feeling weirdly like a one night stand and I don’t know what to do to make it not feel like that.” Rio’s eyes are wide and exasperated, like she’s lost all patience for playing coy or beating around the bush. Agatha checks her phone to see that her Uber is still two minutes away before setting the bag with her clothes down and rounding the counter.</p><p>She takes Rio’s face between her hands and squishes her cheeks ever so slightly, draining some of weight out of the moment. “I know. But it’s not.” Agatha pulls Rio’s face down to meet her own, kissing the tip of her nose and trying to fight back against the immediate feeling that she’s overstepped. “We’ll talk about it soon, okay? I–” she cuts herself off before she can say <em> I promise </em>, but Rio seems to catch it anyway. She leans her face into Agatha’s right palm.</p><p>“Soon,” Rio agrees, releasing them both from it.</p><p>Agatha pulls back, collecting her things from the counter and walking to Rio’s front door. She spares one glance back to where Rio is leaning against the wall and stepping into her shoes, trying to act entirely nonchalant while she watches Agatha leave.</p><p>“Have a good day at work.”</p><p>“You too. <em> Te veo. </em>”</p><hr/><p>On Saturday, Wanda mercifully agrees to drive Agatha back to the law firm to retrieve her car on the assumption that it hasn’t already been towed. Or it would be merciful, but Wanda demands that in return for her help Agatha must tell her everything about the deposition. With no viable alternative, Agatha acquiesces.</p><p>She tells her the most minimalistic version of events, starting with Rio staying over the week before and the call she’d had with Lilia, telling herself that they add necessary context. Then Agatha describes  the musty room, the vicious tone that they questioned her in, the way she narrowly avoided causing a scene. Waking up in Rio’s apartment and staying there. Agatha pointedly does not tell Wanda about the sex, though she sees her mouth curl into a smile when she mentions leaving the next morning.</p><p>“I am so proud of you,” Wanda says, sniffling and shaking her head slightly, “for all of it.” To Agatha’s horror, Wanda seems to be tearing up slightly at the wheel. Agatha shifts further away in the passenger seat of the SUV, pressing her hip against the door.</p><p>“Don’t get all weird and soft on me now, Maximoff. It’s disgusting.”</p><p>Wanda ignores her. “If I wasn’t actively operating heavy machinery on the highway I would hug you right now.”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. The thought of a hug from Wanda is disturbing but the sentiment causes something small and warm to bloom in her chest all the same. She neglects to tell Wanda that she hasn’t heard from Rio since Wednesday morning when she’d checked to see that Agatha made it home alright and left a thumbs up on Agatha’s response. Best to let at least somebody bask in the sense of relief that had left Agatha days ago, replaced by an increasingly anxious undercurrent.</p><p>Wanda drops her off at her sedan with a hand on her arm and a sincere offer to come back another time and egg their row of shiny, stupid cars that does bring the ghost of a smile to Agatha’s lips. As thanks, Agatha threatens to set her hedges on fire if she ever repeats what Agatha told her to another living soul. Wanda merely blows her a kiss.</p><p>Saturday bleeds into Sunday and seeps all the way through to Thursday without a single text from Rio, almost as though nothing has changed at all. Agatha does <em> not </em> continue to check her phone, thank you very much. By Thursday afternoon the phone lives almost exclusively in a drawer in Agatha’s desk, entirely out of sight and (not so entirely) out of mind.</p><p>It’s fine, she tells herself. They’re both busy people, especially after taking a day off of work in the middle of last week. And now Agatha knows just how much Rio’s been working, seemingly inventing new hours of the day just to get more done.</p><p>Agatha chews on the end of her pen, staring listlessly at her laptop screen. There’s a lot that she’s learning about Rio lately– a lot that she never considered, really. She thinks back to Rio’s apartment that screams ‘divorced dad chic’ and the cigarettes in her pocket and how incongruent they both are with the image of Rio in her head. She may as well be a new person entirely, a voice in Agatha’s mind supplies. A new person that may not want to be back on speaking terms with Agatha after all that they’ve put each other through.</p><p>The thought makes her gut twist, bringing something mean and insecure and unfair to the surface until it pulses in time with her heart. What are they supposed to do here, really? Start acting like the last three and a half years never happened? Pretend everything is normal? The anxious current beneath her skin grows to a heavy static. She thinks of her almost-promise to Rio to talk about it, but every conversation– if they could even qualify– that they’ve had in nearly four years comes back in a rush of shouting and biting and an anger so visceral that her face heats at the thought alone. Agatha's eyes flick to where her phone is burning a hole in the drawer inches away. It doesn't seem like Rio is too enthusiastic to talk about it either, then.</p><p>But Agatha lets out a huff of frustration with herself, pulling the pen from her teeth and scribbling on the notebook page before her. She tries, for her own sake, to find another angle of looking at it before she spirals into oblivion and loses any progress she may have made.</p><p>It’s true that there are parts of Rio that she doesn’t know because she hasn’t been around to see them. It’s also true that Rio had carried her home in that same old Subaru and had made Agatha the same comfort meal that she’d perfected years ago. It’s true that Rio had put on a nature documentary the moment she’d gotten custody of the remote, just like Agatha knew she would, and that she’d touched Agatha in the way that only she knows how to. True that she'd woken up in Agatha’s arms and said<em> I’m glad you’re still here. </em></p><p>So perhaps it’s a bit soon to be forming hard and fast opinions, all things considered.</p><p>A notification vibrates up through the wood of the desk and Agatha, to her shame, flings the drawer open with so much force that it almost breaks. When she lifts the phone up to check it, the frustrating balloon of hope that had sprung up in her chest pops quickly. It’s only Alice, sending another text to remind her of the support group meeting tonight. In her previous unanswered text Alice had explained that this week’s meeting was going to be a party of sorts with more of the plaintiffs than usual coming to town.</p><p>As Agatha and Rio had been the last to join the case, their deposition was the last as well. The group was celebrating that they’d all survived the grueling process, more and now only had to wait for Stephen to work his magic and deliver the verdict that they all so desperately want.</p><p>Agatha had read and reread Alice’s initial text when it came through on Monday, unsure exactly how to decline. It felt too harsh to say that she was pretty sure she’d tanked the entire case when she told Big One that she didn’t blame the clinic for Nicky’s death even if it was the truth. She’d then left the thread, opening Rio’s contact to type and delete a message asking if she was going to go. In the end, Agatha hadn’t said a word to either of them.</p><p>She decides that her best course of action is to tell Alice she isn’t feeling well, which is more or less the truth, in a way. Alice responds with some kind message or another that Agatha doesn’t read, choosing instead to leave her phone in her office to wash her hands of the whole thing.</p><p>Agatha fills her evening with various activities– a neighborhood walk where she ignores Sharon’s offer of lemonade and narrowly avoids getting drenched by Herb’s overpowered sprinkler system, half of a shitty romance novel that she can’t believe she’s wasting her brain cells on, and a game of online Scrabble against Lilia played on her tablet. (Personally Agatha much prefers regular Scrabble, where she can make up fake words and convince her opponents that they’re just too stupid to understand her word of choice. The digital age deprives her of this joy.)</p><p>The sun has long set when Agatha stops back into her office on her way to bed, pulling the phone from its drawer and finding her only missed texts to be from Wanda. Based on the hour, Agatha knows that the support group’s party must be over. She wonders if Rio went.</p><p>Agatha navigates back to Rio’s contact, her thumb hovering over the call button just below her blurry contact photo. She wants to ask <em> did you go to their party? How was it? Did I ruin their whole case with my stubborn rage? And while we’re here, am I still something that you could want? Are you ignoring me because last week was just a fluke for you? </em></p><p>So anyway, Agatha does not do that. She turns the phone off and leaves it face down on the desk, certain it’ll have ample time to torment her tomorrow.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>By two on Friday afternoon, Agatha’s work week is crawling to a mostly painless close as she rides out the end meeting she hasn’t paid a moment of attention to. She’s made her peace with an evening spent reorganizing her bathroom drawers and dusting the baseboards in her bedroom. The high life.</p><p>Her phone buzzes where it sits next to her laptop. Agatha congratulates herself on the lack of notable reaction from the insufferable organ beating in her chest at the sound. She spent more time than she’d care to admit this morning reminding herself in the bathroom mirror that she’s not a school girl with a silly little crush; caring so violently about whether or not somebody sends her a text is unbecoming and frankly pathetic, even if said somebody is Rio.</p><p>Agatha waits the full five minutes until the meeting ends before reading the notification.</p><p><b>Unknown: </b> <em> Hey, it’s Jen. Come get drinks with us tn. And don’t pretend you’re sick again. </em></p><p>Agatha’s lips twitch up in spite of herself. She finds that the text is unexpected but not unwelcome, the words playing in her head in Jen’s no-nonsense voice. There’s no room for her to turn down the offer even if she wanted to. And shockingly, Agatha finds that she <em> wants </em>to go.</p><p>She remembers that Alice and Jen will want to know how the deposition went and falters, her tentative excitement for the meet up waning. At least it’ll be easier to talk about the deposition if she doesn’t have to be sober. Easier to wash her hands of the whole thing.</p><p>She double taps the message with her thumb and leaves a little like, regaining a bit of glee at imagining Jen’s eye roll at the lack of real response. Jen sends back an address and a time and Agatha finds herself wondering how Jen and Alice could have possibly ended up together with all of the glaring differences in their demeanor.</p><p>Her thoughts roam on the subject and she doesn’t catch her fingers moving on autopilot, closing out of her conversation thread with Jen and opening the one with Rio, still as blank as it was a week ago. When she looks down at the phone again, Agatha rolls her eyes so hard that the tendons pull taut. Suddenly, the prospect of leaving her house and getting alcohol in her system tonight feels even more appealing, despite the persistent nagging from the back of her mind.</p><p>At half past eight she looks herself over in the entryway mirror, tugging at the hem of her black tank top so that it falls over the waist of her jeans. Agatha knows that she shouldn’t be nervous, and maybe she’s not. Either way, some sort of uneasiness flutters in her ribs, a harbinger of something that she can’t quite put her finger on. She swallows it back, pocketing her phone before heading out the door and into her Uber.</p><p>The bar that Jen chose isn’t one Agatha thinks she’s been to before, all high top tables with chrome details and spinning stools with no back support. It toes the line of a retro theme, but something about the subtle modern touches and the slow rolling music that hums through the hidden speakers makes it work.</p><p>Given that it’s still pretty early for a Friday night, Alice and Jen aren’t difficult to spot. They’re perched already at a table with three stools, angled in towards one another. Agatha notes that an untouched glass of wine waits in front of the empty stool and pulls the inside of her cheek between her teeth to avoid the threat of an oncoming smile.</p><p>Alice notices her first, peeling her eyes away from Jen and offering Agatha an easy smile. Jen turns at the gesture, giving a much more subtle but no less inviting wave of her hand. It feels oddly normal to stride over and join them, like they’re the kinds of people that often meet up to bitch and drink after a long week. Like she’s the kind of person who people would want to do that with.</p><p>“It’s good to see you Agatha,” Alice says, the smile never leaving her face. “Are you feeling better?”</p><p>Jen gives a slight roll of her eyes out of Alice’s view, taking a sip of her drink. Agatha's lips contort into a pout before she can stop herself, voice slipping into faux-seriousness.</p><p>“<em>Much </em> better, thank you for asking. I was really down for the count there for a minute.”</p><p>“Being antisocial doesn’t count as an ailment.”</p><p>Alice squeezes Jen’s arm in warning under the table, but she doesn’t flinch, leaving her eyes trained on Agatha. After a brief staring contest Agatha breathes a theatrical sigh, tossing her hands in the air before picking up her wine glass. “You got me, Kale. But can you blame me for wanting to skip Jeff’s twenty minute speech about the power of friendship and all of this being a blessing in disguise?”</p><p>She takes a sip and watches Alice’s immediate grimace. Hit the nail on the head with that one, then. Jen cracks her first smile of the night and Agatha catches it despite the brevity of its appearance.</p><p>“Well, either way I’m sorry you couldn’t make it. I wanted to thank you again for joining the suit even though you had some reservations. All of our voices matter for this.” Alice’s tone is earnest, her hand resting on the table like she’s subconsciously hoping for Agatha to reach out and take it.</p><p>Agatha flinches internally, each word pelting her like a sharp stone. Reality finds her once more, stripping her bare of the foolhardy assumption that a nice evening could just be a nice evening. Alice thanking her burns more than Agatha would like, rubbing up against the raw wound of the deposition and the way she had more or less handed Perlman’s lawyers a loaded gun aimed at their case.</p><p>She twirls her glass, watching the wine bubble and swirl to avoid meeting any eyes. “You shouldn’t thank me.”</p><p>Alice’s brow furrows in confusion, her eyes flitting to Jen before turning back to Agatha. “Why not?”</p><p>“I said I didn’t think Nicky’s death was the clinic’s fault. And I called their lawyer a useless son of a bitch at least once.”</p><p>A silence falls over the table. Agatha doesn’t lift her eyes from the wine, now motionless in her glass. When the hush becomes suffocating, she fills the space.</p><p>“I think that you’re right about what they did to Lorna and to the Kaplan kid and probably to the others, but with Nicky…” she trails off, parsing through her thoughts to pick the right words. “They wanted to blame Rio for what happened and I couldn’t let them. But when he died, I didn’t think to blame the clinic either. And I told them as much.” Agatha purses her lips. “So I told the truth even though it probably fucked your whole case. You shouldn’t thank me for that.”</p><p>The silence continues to drag and Agatha waits for one or both of them to yell at her, or throw a drink at her, or storm out. Instead, Alice’s hand bridges the last of the gap and covers her own, giving it a squeeze. When Agatha lifts her eyes she finds Alice waiting patiently, unshed tears shimmering at her waterline.</p><p>“I am so proud of you,” she says.</p><p>Agatha tenses with confusion, waiting for the catch, but Alice continues. “You’ve been carrying that weight for a long time. Those people were fucking awful and you still stood your ground. That’s what all of this is for, Agatha– not for saying whatever shit wins the case, but for telling the truth and making them hear it, no matter what that looks like.”</p><p>Agatha wants to find it in herself to recoil from Alice’s blatant sincerity and the steady pressure of her palm, but instead she finds herself close to choking up. God, this week has been an emotional shit show.</p><p>She slides her eyes from Alice’s face and over to Jen, trying and failing to get a read on her expression. Best to get it all out of the way at once, Agatha figures.</p><p>“Aren’t you pissed that I’ve screwed the case by saying it wasn’t Perlman’s fault?”</p><p>Jen crosses her arms over her chest and tilts her head slightly as if in contemplation, flicking her eyes somewhere past Agatha while she thinks.</p><p>“No,” she says simply. “Like Stephen said when you guys first showed up, your story was meant to bolster the more damning cases. If anything, your answer and demeanor probably painted a good picture of the kind of damage that not having all of the information can do.”</p><p>Jen’s tone is light, like she’s weighing the odds and finding them favorable. Agatha feels slightly dumbstruck by her casual poise. Jen catches her eye and offers a light shrug.</p><p>“You lost your son, which is an obvious tragedy, but you and Rio lost each other too. You lost yourself. It’s– I think you can be a real bitch when you want to, Agatha, but it was very brave of you to join the suit at all.” Something in her gaze sharpens, that same smile from before tugging at her mouth. “And I’m glad you guys could put those cunts in their place a little bit.”</p><p>Alice shoots Jen a look but Jen only knocks their shoulders together. “There are no kids here, Al. I’m allowed to say cunts.”</p><p>Agatha’s mind returns to a middle school girls locker room in June, listening as Jen casually voices her fear of turning into Agatha if Lorna dies. She gets it now. She has been recognizing so much of herself in Alice’s rage but can now see that Jen’s family is her world. That Jen is abrasive and perhaps rude and definitely tolerant of very few people but is loyal to Alice and Lorna until the end. How if she lost them, she could turn into a steel fortress or a ghost, just as Agatha had.</p><p>Uncomfortable with the mirror she’s holding to herself and the weight of Alice and Jen’s attention, no matter how productive of a conversation they’re having, Agatha pivots. She withdraws her hand from beneath Alice’s and pushes a stray hair out of her face.</p><p>“How was the party, then? Besides Jeff’s monologue.”</p><p>Alice hesitates for a split second like she wants to linger in the moment before leaning back and granting Agatha’s silent request. She and Jen launch into a tandem account of the night before, painting an overarching picture of bittersweet celebration complete with party store balloons and homemade cupcakes and plastic folding tables on the gym floor. Agatha finds herself genuinely listening, huffing a laugh at their descriptions of the kids’ impromptu, semi-choreographed dance and Carol being cornered by a wine drunk Rebecca.</p><p>“Now it’s just a waiting game,” Jen says, her nose scrunching in distaste. “Who knows how long a verdict will take.”</p><p>Agatha realizes she hadn’t even begun to think about where the case goes from here. It’s been such a substantial part of her life for the past few months– looming around every corner– that she finds she’s not quite sure what to do without the next date set on her calendar. </p><p>“We’ll all see each other before then, at least,” Alice chimes.</p><p>“Was yesterday not a sort of farewell situation?”</p><p>Alice shrugs. “I mean, we’re definitely still gonna meet, probably just less often. But I was more so referring to Nate’s funeral.” Agatha’s brain stutters before her neurons fire, snapping the name in place with the memory of the dead boy in the group chat. Her stomach twists sharply.</p><p>“It’s in September,” Jen adds to round out Alice’s thought. “The Bartons invited the whole group, so the details are just in the chat.” Agatha takes a large gulp the finish her wine and signals a passing waiter to bring her another, trying to focus on the dry taste coating her tongue instead of another dead boy in an undersized casket.</p><p>“Sure,” Agatha says, not entirely caring if the response makes sense. “Thanks for the heads up.”</p><p>Jen nods, watching the waiter trade Agatha’s empty glass for a new one. Alice uses the lull to excuse herself to the restroom, leaving the two of them alone.</p><p>Beneath the weight of Jen’s quiet gaze Agatha feels exposed, like Jen can see every last loose thread. Not that she’ll pull at them, but that she could if she wanted. Agatha tries once more to pivot to safer ground but realizes she’s put in far too little thought before actually opening her mouth.</p><p>“Was Rio at the party?”</p><p>Immediately, she wants to bash her skull against the tabletop. As it is, she bites sharply into her bottom lip.</p><p>Jen’s eyebrows raise but her tone stays neutral. “No, she said she was busy and couldn’t make it.”</p><p>This time, Agatha bites her tongue quickly enough to keep the <em> with what </em> that bubbles up into her throat. She hasn’t reached that level of visible insanity just yet. “Oh,” she says instead, trying for nonchalant. “Cool.”</p><p>Jen drops her brows but narrows her eyes, clearly already over Agatha’s avoidant theatrics. “Are you two still not on speaking terms? Because I was sort of assuming that things had gotten at least somewhat better after you said you defended her during the deposition.”</p><p>Agatha shifts her weight and the stool beneath her creaks. Talking about it out loud feels a bit like rolling over and exposing her soft underbelly for any passing knife to pierce, but if she holds it in much longer she might just burst anyway.</p><p>“They kind of did, but she hasn’t reached out to me since.” Agatha crosses her arms and shrugs, like this means nothing to her. Like Rio reaching out or not is a deeply unimportant matter.</p><p>Jen, for her part, levels Agatha with a glare that seems to be serving in place of calling her a big dumb bitch. “Well did you think to text her at all? It kind of feels like the ball is in your court on this one.”</p><p>Agatha reels back as if Jen has backhanded her. “How could the ball <em> possibly </em> be in my court? I said that we needed to talk and she agreed, so now it’s on her to decide how that happens.”</p><p>“Okay, well the only time I’ve ever seen you both in the same room, you nearly took her head off for trying to include you in a conversation. So if I were her, I’d be waiting to see where you take things first to be on the safe side. Especially if you were the one who said y’all needed to talk.”</p><p>Agatha’s first instinct is to defend herself. There was a lot of shit happening on the internal turmoil front during that meeting, thank you very much. But she pauses instead, considering Jen’s perspective. Rio <em> had </em> taken her into her apartment, and cared for her, and made her dinner and asked her to stay. And Agatha had been the one to almost promise that they would talk about everything. She sighs, sipping her wine and glaring at Jen over the rim of her glass.</p><p>Jen only smirks triumphantly. Alice returns to the table, sliding back onto her stool. “Did I miss anything fun?”</p><p>Jen’s smirk doesn’t waver and Agatha wonders if she’s about to be humiliated for her vulnerability. Knife point to underbelly and all that.</p><p>“Nothing at all. Agatha and I were debating who we think they’ll kill off in the next season of Grey’s.”</p><p>Alice frowns slightly like she can’t imagine a less interesting topic. Surprised at Jen’s blatant lie, Agatha tries in vain to catch her eye.</p><p>“Well,” Alice announces, “it’s about time for us to head back, unfortunately. We only have the sitter until eleven.” She shoots Agatha a smile. “I hope we can do this again, though. Maybe with less lawsuit-centric vibes.”</p><p>Agatha shrugs like the proposition is exhausting but the small smile on her face gives her away. “Maybe,” she concedes.</p><p>“Definitely,” Jen decides. “I need more insufferable bitches in my circle. Alice’s friends are all too nice.” Agatha’s smile blooms into something full fledged at that.</p><p>Alice and Jen pay despite her protests and the three of them find their way back out to the sidewalk. Alice loops her fingers through Jen’s, swinging their arms between them as she looks back at Agatha. “We’re parked down the street. Do you want us to wait with you until your Uber gets here?”</p><p>Agatha gives a playful roll of her eyes and waves her off. “I’m a big girl, Alice. I think I’ll be alright on my own for a few minutes in downtown suburbia.” She pauses. “But thank you.”</p><p>They big her goodbye and walk off down the street, leaving Agatha alone again with her thoughts. The neon sign of the bar paints the sidewalk in a pinkish hue as she pulls her phone out to call a car, tapping absently at the screen while the app loads.</p><p>She thinks back to what Jen said and how Rio might be waiting for her to reach out first. The thought of doing so fills her with an odd mix of overstepping a boundary and admitting defeat, intertwining tightly in her chest. Agatha navigates back to the text thread, still unchanged from the hundreds of times she’s looked at it since last Wednesday.</p><p>Swallowing her pride, Agatha pulls the trigger and sends off a simple ‘<em>hi </em>’ before clicking her phone off again and pretending very valiantly that she’s not actively waiting for Rio to respond.</p><p>In the fifteen minutes between sending the text and her car pulling up, Agatha goes through every stage of grief before settling on defeat at Rio’s lack of response. Her message goes unacknowledged and Agatha wonders if there’s any merit in googling how to unsend a text fifteen minutes after the fact but ultimately decides against it.</p><p>She slips into the back of the Uber, feeding the address to the driver on muscle memory and yet still finding herself surprised when the car rolls to a stop outside of the cemetery. Agatha sighs as the driver awkwardly bids her a goodnight, silently urging the woman in his backseat that made him drive to a graveyard to get a move on. She takes the hint and steps out onto the sidewalk, unsure what prompted her brain to give this address instead of her own but nonetheless grateful to see Nicky.</p><p>Agatha steps up to the front gate and pulls, taken aback when the iron rattles but doesn’t budge. She tries again, harder this time, to no avail. Finally, Agatha remembers what Rio had said– the cemetery locks at night now because of the drunk teens breaking in. Agatha, a drunk adult, huffs at the obstacle.</p><p>The fence rises to the height of her ribs, and Agatha eyes it with a calculating glint. Deciding she has just enough alcohol in her body to commit, Agatha takes hold of the fence and wedges one foot between two rungs, swinging her other leg up and over like she’s mounting a horse. She pulls her foot back before repeating the motion with her back leg, landing gracelessly in the grass on the other side.</p><p>Agatha ignores the ache in her knees and focuses instead on the silly sort of pride that warms her chest, slightly thawing the cool sting of Rio’s apparent rejection burning in her chest.</p><p>Despite the dark of the night, Agatha winds her way down paths and between headstones towards Nicky with minimal stumbling. When she draws near, though, she finds that it’s not entirely dark at all. A flashlight lays haphazardly in the grass between the flowers at the foot of his headstone, illuminating the half formed outline of a figure.</p><p>The trespasser lays silent and motionless in the dark, almost like they’re sleeping. The flashlight doesn’t provide Agatha with any detail on the figure, and she wonders if this must be one of the teenagers in question, too greened out to move. Rage boils at the thought. There are hundreds of fucking graves here, no way in hell is she letting some drunk kid use Nicky’s like a park bench.</p><p>“What the hell are you doing on my son’s grave, you sick fuck?” Agatha hisses, letting venom coat her voice.</p><p>There’s a silent pause and then a shuffling noise as the figure moves. Agatha doesn’t catch any new details before the flashlight is pointed directly into her eyes, effectively blinding her. She scrunches up her eyes against the sting of it, ready to scream until she hears a bright burst of laughter.</p><p>“Ma’am, maybe I should ask you what you’re doing drunkenly breaking into the cemetery and coming to <em> my </em> son’s grave?” Rio calls back, light and teasing. The beam of light is angled away and Agatha opens her eyes again, adjusting to the change. Rio leans the flashlight skyward against the headstone, propped up on her elbows but making no move to get out of the grass.</p><p>A warmth entirely unrelated to the late summer air or the alcohol in her blood fills Agatha, and suddenly the texting stuff doesn’t really feel like it matters so much. She’s thankful that Rio can’t see her blush in the dark and wraps her arms around herself, swaying slightly.</p><p>“I’m not drunk. Just a little tipsy,” she corrects. Rio only hums, a delighted little sound from the back of her throat as she waits for an answer. “I just wanted to talk to him, I guess.”</p><p>Rio ignores Agatha’s shy tone and pats the grass next to her. “Sure, we were just talking about the constellations. Let me scoot over.”</p><p>She shifts, leaving a gap wide enough to fit Agatha’s body and still leave space between them. Agatha– and she would say it was the alcohol if pressed– ignores the gesture and strides to finally stand at the foot of his grave before finding her way to the ground and pressing her body fully against Rio’s side. Rio’s breath catches at the contact but still her arm bends to support Agatha’s head, cushioning her skull with the meat of her bicep.</p><p>Agatha feels the tension of their silent week bleed out of her at once, a content sigh leaving her lips. Before either of them can think about it too much, Agatha breaks the silence.</p><p>“Okay, Galileo. Tell us about the stars.”</p><p>And so Rio does, using that low tone that usually gets reserved for bedtime stories or telling Agatha about her childhood or talking to Nicky through Agatha’s stomach when she was pregnant. Rio’s voice rumbles out through her chest and seeps into Agatha’s skin as she talks, occasionally pointing up into the sky to emphasize a certain point.</p><p>Some of her constellation knowledge is real and some of it is made up, Agatha’s sure, but she can’t tell one from the other as Rio tells them stories about stars fighting valiant battles and stars that were friends and stars that are forbidden lovers. Stars that come together to form gods and warriors and scorpions and bears.</p><p>Agatha loses herself in the soothing cadence, the soft sing-song of Rio mumbling into her ear. Rio’s bicep shifts beneath her head as her fingers play mindlessly with a lock of Agatha’s hair, and Agatha pauses to truly wonder how she could have spent four years without this.</p><p>How, in this life, she had convinced herself that this was something she couldn’t have. Agatha knows exactly how, though– how nobody tells you that it’s easier to wear the skin that you’re in than leave yourself naked for the time that it takes to grow a new one. Nobody tells you that when this is the case, you should do the hard thing instead– strip yourself bare and accept the hands that offer to hold you in the meantime.</p><p>But she had clung to that skin for dear life, unshakable in her belief that the world would collapse if she loosened her grip for even a moment. Yet now, laying here with Rio and Nicky in the cool summer grass, nothing earth shattering has come to call. Nobody is mad at her about the deposition, and even if they lose the case, Agatha told the truth. She’d said the words and Rio had heard them, and more than that Rio had stayed. Rio thinks that she’s good.</p><p>For the first time, Agatha starts to think something new: maybe she was wrong. Maybe, somehow, it wasn’t her fault. Maybe it was never quite as much about forgiving Rio as it is about forgiving herself. Maybe there gets to be a softer future than the one she had resigned herself to.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t realize that she’s fallen asleep to the steady thrum of Rio’s voice until Rio rouses her, tapping a finger lightly against her temple. She opens her eyes with a groan, finding that she’s somehow curled herself fully into Rio’s side, face pressed to her armpit and one hand having bunched up Rio’s shirt to reach the soft skin of her opposite hip.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio murmurs. “You can’t spend the night in a cemetery, sweetheart.”</p><p>“Fucking watch me,” she grumbles, any lightness from her wine long gone. Rio laughs, guiding her to a sitting position before standing and brushing the dirt from her own jeans. Agatha takes the hand that she offers, wincing at the loud crack of her knees on the way up. Rio grabs the flashlight before leading them back to the gate.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha says drily, “the gate is still locked.”</p><p>“It is.”</p><p>“How exactly are we supposed to get out of here?”</p><p>Rio smiles wide enough to show the gap in her teeth before bending down and lacing her fingers together at the approximate height of Agatha’s knees. “After you, m’lady.”</p><p>“I am too old for this shit.”</p><p>“You weren’t too old to do it by yourself two hours ago.”</p><p>Agatha grumbles at that before placing her foot in Rio’s hands, squealing only slightly as Rio launches her up and over the fence. She lands with only minor stumbling, though she knows her back will be sore tomorrow. A moment later, Rio vaults herself easily over and lands a foot away. Agatha realizes she must do this fairly often.</p><p>“Come on, I’m parked right over here.”</p><p>Rio leads them to the car, stepping around to open the passenger door for Agatha. Agatha sticks out her tongue but gets in all the same, buckling herself in as Rio walks back around and gets into her seat. The headlights flare on as the car hums to life, and Rio reaches over to set her phone in one of the cup holders. </p><p>She checks the home screen for notifications briefly and the rectangle of light illuminates her small smirk. She clicks it off and finishes setting the phone down before redirecting her gaze to the road and pulling away from the curb. When she speaks, her tone is light and playful.</p><p>“Wouldn’t you know it, I have one missed text from an Agatha Harkness. I was beginning to think that maybe she’d blocked my number again.”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, tapping her fingers against the denim over her thigh and turning her face slightly toward the window in hopes of fighting her rising blush.</p><p>“I was waiting for you to text me first,” she offers.</p><p>Rio snorts a quiet little laugh. “God, we’re going to be hopeless at this, aren’t we?”</p><p>There it is again, that implication of more time. More chances.</p><p>Agatha hums in false contemplation. “I guess we are.”</p><p>The streets are empty at this time of night, just the clunky gait of the Subaru and the orange streetlights streaming past. They pull into the driveway far sooner than Agatha expects or wants. Rio shifts the car into park and leans back in her seat, the silence present but not unwelcome.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t get out right away, searching for the right words and coming up empty. She wants to ask Rio to stay but knows that it wouldn’t be fair.</p><p>She feels Rio’s fingers reach out as they catch the hair that’s fallen into her face and curl to tuck it back behind her ear with a familiar gentleness. Like a lightning bolt down her spine, Agatha remembers something that now seems possible to have ever forgotten. <em> I see you, Agatha. Siempre te veo. </em></p><p>Rio’s eyes are warm when Agatha looks over to meet them. “I want to,” she says. “I just think it’s good for us to take this slow, keep our own space until we can talk about things a bit more.”</p><p>Her tone is not apologetic but still soothing, and Agatha knows that she’s right. She also knows that she’s hurt Rio so much in the past few years that this home probably doesn’t feel all that safe to her anymore. The thought lodges sharply between her ribs.</p><p>Agatha nods and offers what she hopes is an understanding smile, given how tired she feels and how much she wishes she could drag Rio into her skin and tuck her beneath her ribs instead of saying goodbye. She unbuckles her seatbelt and moves to open the door only to pause. Hesitantly, Agatha turns and leans across the center console to press a quick, chaste kiss to Rio’s cheek. She revels in the feeling of warm skin beneath her lips.</p><p>Agatha pulls away just as quickly as she leaned in, afraid to overstep, but Rio catches her with a hand on her jaw and pulls her back into orbit. Their lips slot together with an ease like breathing and Agatha finds herself melting into it, exhaling a soft noise against Rio’s cheek. The fingers cradling Agatha’s face flex slightly, pressing into the curve of her jaw before Rio pulls away with a healthy blush on her cheeks.</p><p>“Goodnight,” Agatha whispers into the space between them. A little grin finds Rio’s face again.”<em>Te veo.” </em></p><p>Agatha finally makes her way out of the car and back into the house, setting about her night time routine. A bittersweet feeling blankets the process, and she tries to push back against the whisper of disappointment she feels at Rio not staying.</p><p>It’s entirely irrational, she knows. Logically, it makes sense for them to keep their distance and Agatha even agrees that it’s best not to push things to move too quickly. Still, something old and small inside of her feels the slight sting of rejection as she goes about changing into her pajamas and brushing her teeth.</p><p>Agatha finally crawls into bed, squinting disdainfully at the late– or early, rather– time blinking back from her alarm clock, figuring at least it’s a Saturday that she’s about to sleep through. She’s only just clicked off her lamp when there’s a knock at the front door. It’s faint from all the way up in her bedroom, and for a moment Agatha wonders if she’s imagined it until it comes again, slightly more insistent.</p><p>Agatha flicks the light back on, grabbing her robe from the bedroom door and padding back down the stairs. She turns the deadbolt and peers out, unsure what she was expecting but finding it decidedly wasn’t Rio, bare faced and in her pajamas.</p><p>“I don’t know why I thought that this was when I’d finally learn to be normal about you.”</p><p>It’s all Rio says before brushing through the doorway and past Agatha, kicking off her slides at the door before striding straight up the stairs. Dumbfounded, Agatha turns the lock once more and follows her, finding Rio turning down her side of the bed and tucking herself in like it’s the most natural thing in the world. Agatha marvels at the absurdity of it all for a second before mirroring her actions, hanging her robe back up and slipping beneath the covers. Again, she turns the lamp off, shrouding the room in darkness.</p><p>As if on cue, Rio reaches out and drags Agatha’s body backwards into the cradle of her arms. There’s a dual sigh, like the contact brings them both physical relief.</p><p>A final half-conscious thought floats its way across Agatha’s mind– even if it takes a lifetime to make things right, it will have been worth it for even one more moment of this. When Rio buries her face into the crook of her shoulder, Agatha figures she agrees.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Two weeks pass in this strange new normal, and the final dregs of summer bleed out of Massachusetts so that fall can take its rightful place with the start of September. Texting Rio stops being a daunting roadblock and meanders its way towards becoming a regular part of Agatha’s routine, though their messages stay light. A testing of the waters. A photo secretly taken of Lilia ranting during a work Zoom, an anecdote from Rio about two raccoons brawling outside of her apartment dumpster.</p><p>Rio stays long enough to make breakfast that Saturday morning, but Agatha only gets until Monday evening to panic about returning to a state of limbo before she shows up again. Rio lets herself into the door without knocking, and neither of them acknowledge that she’s had a key this entire time. Or that Agatha never changed the locks like she’d once claimed to have done.</p><p>Agatha can feel the fragility of it all when they sit and watch TV on the couch or when Rio comes over later in the week to cook dinner together, a delicate sort of dance that they’re performing. There are times when Agatha catches herself having to manually put her guard down, letting her lungs expand and release before giving a response. It’s jarring, really, to find that her first instinct isn’t always pro-Rio anymore. A knee-jerk response from the past four years plastering itself over the fifteen before that. It’s a clumsy act, relearning how to be soft. Rolling up her barbed wire fence and pricking her finger as she goes.</p><p>Agatha can see it in Rio sometimes too– the hardening of her eyes mid-conversation, like she’s waiting for Agatha to strike. The tensing of her shoulders when she comes across some decor change or rearranged cabinet in the house serving as a reminder of her visitor status. Still, the music plays on and their dance continues.</p><p>So they’re talking, but they aren’t <em>talking.</em> It’s as if they’re in a sort of honeymoon bubble, both afraid to drag anything too real up to the surface and look it in the face for fear of what they’ll find. But the closer that they get to the Barton kid’s funeral, the more Agatha can feel it coming like bile rising in the back of her throat. A reckoning looming on the horizon.</p><p>Still, she savors the weight of Rio’s fingers at her jaw. Still, she stands in the hall where Rio’s scent lingers after she’s gone, taking in greedy lungfuls of the precious air. Agatha clings to these small treasures, holding them in her iron grip while the impending meteor of change hurtles toward the earth.</p><hr/><p>It’s more expensive to have a funeral on a Sunday than it is a Saturday or a weekday. The thought circles the drain idly somewhere in the back of Agatha’s mind, a strange fact filed away by accident. The Bartons must not mind.</p><p>It’s not the same funeral home, at least, Agatha tells herself. It’s the one on the other side of town, with similarly musty walls and a singular auditorium-like space filled with rows upon rows of plastic folding chairs and a line of mothball scented couches pressed along the back wall where she hovers. Where she’s been hovering, quite frankly, since she and Rio got out of the car.</p><p>The drive had been quiet, filled with some new and uncharted sort of tension that set her teeth on edge. Like oxygen molecules wrenching themselves apart before a storm.</p><p>The undersized casket rests on a raised dais surrounded by a veritable bounty of flowers, the lid mercifully closed. A large canvas portrait of the little boy– Nate, she remembers– is propped on a trifold stand just below it, finishing the line up of the Barton family. Two older kids, a girl and a boy, stand next to their parents in their meticulously ironed dress and suit. Agatha would wager that they’re about ten and seven; the girl seems old enough to carry this sorrow, her back ram-rod straight and her fists clenched at her sides. Her little brother grasps the somber nature of the moment but more than anything he looks confused, clinging to his mother’s legs and avoiding eye contact with those who pass.</p><p>Agatha watches the line of mourners parade past the Bartons, shaking hands and giving hugs and bestowing well intentioned words of empathy. She watches Rio take her place in front of them, shaking the man’s hand before leaning in. Agatha can’t see Rio’s face, but she watches as something behind the man’s haunted eyes softens, a recognition of sorts taking root. Rio pulls back, giving the man a pat on the shoulder before taking another step and similarly soothing Mrs. Barton.</p><p>It was Rio, after all, who shook everyone’s hand at Nicky’s funeral. Who had accepted condolences gracefully and thanked everyone sincerely and made eye contact while Agatha had only hovered near his casket, somewhere outside of her body. </p><p>With her free hand, Agatha tugs as the skirt of Wanda’s black dress, borrowed once again. In the other, her half empty paper cup of water turns flaky as it starts to disintegrate, little white paper balls clinging on the pads of her fingers.</p><p>From her spot in the back of the room, Agatha does a scan and finds a few familiar faces. Alice and Jen, the Kaplans, Carol, and a few nameless others from the one meeting she’d attended. Lorna scratches at her leg over her tights as Jen pulls her carefully into one of the chairs near the front. Agatha wonders how many of these she’s been to already. The thought stings immediately, and Agatha shifts her weight to one hip while she breathes through it.</p><p>In part because she doesn’t want to and in part because she can’t, Agatha doesn’t return any of their proffered waves when their eyes find her hidden in the shadows, doesn’t go up and say anything to the family. Doesn’t take the empty seat that Rio clearly leaves for her, though she files away the way Rio doesn’t seem disappointed by this. She only finds Agatha with those steady eyes, taking her in just before turning back as the room falls quiet.</p><p>A pastor or a priest or maybe just a man in a suit rises to the dais, the microphone in his hand ringing when he lifts it to his mouth before it settles. Agatha takes stock of the bodies that have filled up the space, the rows of folding chairs almost entirely occupied. She lets her eyes roam over the backs of their heads while the speaker leads them all in some sort of prayer, maybe, or convocation.</p><p>His voice is nothing more than a disjointed cadence at the background of her thoughts, swimming through Agatha’s murky attempt to delineate between what’s different and what’s the same.</p><p>Different: wrong funeral home, wrong day, wrong fucking cups for the water.</p><p>Same: that little coffin. Rows and rows of people who she can’t name. Rows of people that she can name but won’t speak to. The feeling that she’s suffocating, that she can’t move, that she’s been stuffed inside of a glass box where everything is muffled and blurred.</p><p>There are surely more things to be filed into each list, small details that Agatha can’t catch now or could never recall. Nicky’s funeral, try as she might to remember it, feels like something out of a childhood dream. Something close to a memory, but too blurry to be sure.</p><p>She was in the room, surely, though somewhere outside of her body. Somewhere where her son was not dead. There was no pastor, but Lilia was the first to speak. Surely it was personal and moving, though Agatha will never be sure.</p><p>She and Rio were supposed to go up to the little podium together after that, but her body wouldn’t stand. It was as though everything within her had shut down, unable to comply for fear that going through the motions meant it was real, that he was dead. She can remember that Rio stood anyway, smoothing down her dress with shaking hands before turning to face everyone.</p><p>For a long time, Agatha couldn’t remember what it was Rio had said. A reading from a poem, maybe, or had they written down something to say together? But a month after Rio left, the words echoed through her skull over yet another nightmare, Rio’s voice coming back so clearly that Agatha had shot upright, certain she had come back home.</p><p><em>“Grief, they say, is the final translation of love– this final way that we get to look after our boy.”</em></p><p><em>Rio’s voice cracked. Her right hand flexed against the podium, like she wanted to reach for Agatha but knew she wasn’t there.</em></p><p><em>“And what a gift it is, to love Nicky. To know that he will be with us for the rest of our lives, even if it isn’t in the way he was supposed to. In the smudges on our walls and the quiet moments of joy and every time Rocky Mountain High plays on the radio.” The crowd murmured a quiet laugh, but it did little to mask the watery quality in Rio’s voice, warbling through her words. When the noise died, she paused as though to gather herself, taking one shaky breath.</em></p><p><em>“I desperately, violently, miss my son. No amount of time with him could have ever been enough, but I– we are grateful for the nine years that we got him. Every second of it. And I can’t wait until our family is together again.”</em></p><p>Even now, the one thing that Agatha can picture clearly is how beautiful Rio looked even in her devastation. How much of her face had been in their son, and how instead of soothing her it had twisted into something sour.</p><p>It was Rio that the doctors gave their diagnosis to and Rio who all the neighbors addressed their cards and flowers and prayers. Rio, the approachable one. Rio, the beautiful mourner. Rio, the real mother.</p><p>The vengeful ghost of the feeling rears its ugly head as everyone rises to the opening notes of a hymn, though guilt now wars with it at equal strength. Agatha tosses her crumbling cup into a trash can and strides to the nearby exit without looking back, breathing in the crisp air of the funeral home’s attached graveyard. It’s a smaller one than where they buried Nicky, though still well maintained. Still beautiful. </p><p>Agatha picks her way down a stone path to a bench beneath a tree at the furthest point from the funeral home, relieved when she can no longer hear the chorus of voices within. When she can no longer see the gaping divot in the earth waiting for Nate’s body.</p><p>Time passes, certainly, between when Agatha sits down and closes her eyes and when a single set of footsteps traces its way down the stone path and settles on the bench beside her. Time passes then, too, between when Rio sits and when she speaks. Whether the pause was for herself or for Agatha, she doesn’t know.</p><p>“That was rather intense.”</p><p>Agatha gives a noncommittal hum, keeping her eyes closed and grounding herself in the feeling of the sun on her face. She tries to let it pass, though her mouth must disagree.</p><p>“I– none of it was fair.” Her voice comes out more petulant than she expected, and Agatha swallows the humiliation that burns in her throat. When Rio doesn’t respond, Agatha cracks her eyes open and slides them over, finding those patient eyes simply waiting. She soldiers on.</p><p>“I was angry that you were so put together when it happened. After it happened, too. I felt like I was some fucked up monster and you just got to be his mother, like somehow they could all see that it was my fault and yours was the only grief that mattered.”</p><p>The words brandish their barbs on the way up, leaving Agatha’s insides burning like raw skin when you rip away the scab. She tries to stanch the bleeding, holds herself back from adding something like <em>he was always yours, long limbs and easy grace and that perfect smile. I was always the piece that didn’t make sense, something extra looming in the shadows.</em></p><p>Rio’s jaw twitches like she heard it anyway. She takes a sharp inhale through her nose and lets it out through her mouth slowly, parting her lips only slightly. When she speaks, her voice is cracked open, her honesty and hurt bleeding through. She stares pointedly at her clasped hands.</p><p>“I thought that if I could just be strong, you could have the space to break. Like if I could just hold all of it together for a little while then you would come back to me. I never thought you’d leave me like that.”</p><p>Rio lifts her eyes to meet Agatha’s, honey gold irises shimmering behind a sheen of unshed tears.</p><p>Here it is then, the meteor.</p><p>Agatha spares a thought back to Atlas holding up the sky. Two hands, four hands, none. The sky has been falling all this time anyway, no matter how she looks at it.</p><p>“You left me though, in the end,” Agatha says. There is no malice in it, only the stating of a fact.</p><p>Rio shakes her head. “No, Agatha. You left first. You have to know that.”</p><p>And of course, here in this moment, she does know it. Can remember slipping outside of her own reach, succumbing to those invisible glass walls instead of putting up a fight. The rage that she had latched onto like a lifeline instead of Rio’s outstretched hand.</p><p>In all of her resentment over Nicky being Rio’s, Agatha had forgotten that he <em>was</em> Rio’s– that she had every right to grieve in her own way, even if it wasn’t as loud as her own. And Agatha forgot that she was Rio’s too, that they belonged to one another. That she could never turn into a monster without Rio being the first casualty.</p><p>Agatha shivers as a breeze gusts by, crossing her legs tightly at the ankle. Silently, Rio shimmies off the blazer she has on over her own dress and drapes it over Agatha’s lap. Somewhere behind them, Agatha can hear the sound of voices as the funeral proceedings transition from the building to the grave site.</p><p>Agatha amends her initial statement. “I wasn’t fair, and I was cruel, and I’m sorry.” Futilely, she digs her teeth into her bottom lip to stop it from quivering. “I shouldn’t have done that to you. I should never have become something for you to fear.”</p><p>Despite their truth, the words don't feel like enough. Agatha wonders if they ever will.</p><p>Rio sighs, unclasping her hands from her lap once more and reaching over to adjust her blazer across Agatha’s legs to cover more of her exposed skin.</p><p>“Neither of us was acting fairly.” Once satisfied with her work, Rio leans back against the bench, taking another breath before meeting Agatha’s eyes again.</p><p>“When I first started coming back around, it was as much because I wanted to hurt you as it was that I wanted to have you. I wanted to bite and scratch and fuck until I was sure that you couldn’t forget me, no matter how hard you tried.”</p><p><em>I didn’t try, </em>Agatha wants to say. <em>I just waited for you to come back and do it again.</em></p><p>“I could see, sometimes, when I said something that hurt you. It was a rush. I felt like at least then I knew that however you chose to hurt me was a response that I had provoked and not just because you hated me.”</p><p>Agatha sucks a breath in through her teeth. The sting beneath her skin returns, but she knows it’s for the best– debriding this wound in hopes that this time she gets a clean, smooth scar.</p><p>Agatha has no misgivings about their encounters over the past few years, as it is. In her minds eye, she holds her two truths up to the light. In one, Rio is the stony, impassive version that Agatha had conjured in her head and warred with time and again, sinking teeth into flesh and leaving over and over. In the other, she is wounded and cornered and throwing a punch for the sake of feeling skin on skin. Agatha understands.</p><p>She reaches for Rio’s clasped hands, settling her palm over the ridges of her knuckles.</p><p>“I wanted to hate you but I never could, and then I hated myself for that.”</p><p>Rio’s hands shift beneath hers, unfolding from one another and flipping to cradle and shelter her palm. Behind them, Agatha can hear the sound of the mourners starting to fade as people begin to leave.</p><p>Here, where the meteor has struck the earth and they both continue to breathe, side by side, Agatha allows herself to believe that it may not yet be over. Maybe, this could be the start of a path forward and not the ticking time bomb that she feared. Maybe they will yet find their way back to one another beyond the half-true twilight zone they’ve been floating in.</p><p>Agatha presses her hand more firmly into Rio’s, ready to continue wading through the thick of it until her stomach breaks through with a sharp growl, shattering the gravity of the moment in its entirety.</p><p>Rio laughs, more a huff of breath escaping through parted lips.</p><p>“Come on,” she says. “I know what you need.”</p><p>When Rio pulls into the parking lot of the diner, Agatha fights a grin. The neon <em>open</em> sign glares above the door as they walk beneath it, and it’s only because she’s in heels that her feet reach the ground when she settles onto the creaky vinyl booth. Rio flags the waitress and orders coffee for them both, tapping out a senseless rhythm against the laminated menu beneath her palm when she’s done.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t pretend to look at the menu, instead watching Rio’s hands move and feeling the tension in her gut begin to unravel with the change of scenery. It almost catches her off guard when Rio’s tapping abruptly stops and she looks up, meeting Agatha’s eyes with something open and curious.</p><p>“Do you think that we ever would have found our way back without the case?”</p><p>Her question does catch Agatha by surprise. She opens her mouth to respond before closing it again, mulling it over. The case is not something that Agatha wants to give credit to, feeling a bit too much like giving credit to Perlman or those lawyers or Stephen.</p><p>Agatha rests her hands on the tacky table top, thinking about the past four years and not just the past four months. The anger and the silence and the fights that felt like storms– bracing herself for impact and knowing she would always snap a bone or two anyway. Watching Rio’s retreating back from the doorway, again and again and again.</p><p>“I like to think… I would have been brave enough to stop you from walking out the door. That some day I’d be making dinner and remember that the only thing I’ve ever really wanted out of this life is to spend it with you.” Agatha purses her lips, looking down and tracing the veins of her hands with her eyes. “I want to believe that of me.”</p><p>When she looks back up, Rio’s eyes are filled with unshed tears again. Agatha’s abdomen clenches, fearing she’s said the wrong thing. Before Rio can respond or she can preemptively apologize, their waitress returns and sets two mugs of steaming coffee down between them. The motion rattles the mugs on their little ceramic saucers and Agatha watches the surface of the liquid ripple.</p><p>“I’ll be right back for your orders,” the waitress assures, but Agatha isn’t listening. She’s watching as Rio slides Agatha’s coffee to herself without a word, reaching out to the edge of the table for little packets of sugar and cream. She tears each open with the tip of her thumb nail, pouring them in with surgical precision and mixing until the coffee is the perfect shade. When it’s done, she slides it back over.</p><p>“The first time we were ever here, I wanted so badly to tell you that I loved you. I just couldn’t make the words come out,” Agatha blurts. Her cheeks heat with the confession, unaware that there was some other layer of vulnerability she was capable of exposing today.</p><p>Rio’s expression is one of surprise before it quickly morphs into that same little knowing look, all these years later. The same glint of mischief alight in her eyes that means she knows something Agatha doesn’t, the same peek of white teeth through lips parted around a smile.</p><p>“That’s okay. I already knew.”</p>
