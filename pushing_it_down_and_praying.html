<p>Rio could still hear the music from the party, the sound coming in muffled through the locked bathroom door. She moved across the room to sit on the edge of the tub, the bass from the music vibrating through the floor as she plopped down.</p><p>What was she thinking coming here, she hated herself for not being able to resist.</p><p>She knew she would see her here.</p><p>Worse, she knew she would see her here, with him.</p><p>What she hadn’t been expecting was to walk into Jen’s bedroom to see Agatha bent over the edge of the mattress with her dress pushed up to her hips and Ralph standing behind her, hands still on the zipper of his jeans. Agatha at least had the decency to look embarrassed, straightening back up and shimmying her dress down while she avoided eye contact. Ralph had just looked pissed off “Do you mind Vidal, we’re kind of in the middle of something and aren’t looking for a third”.</p><p>Rio shook her head, poking her tongue inside her cheek as she turned to leave. She promptly bumped into Jen who’s eyes locked with Rios before glancing over her shoulder to see who Rio had been talking to. Her eyes widened before she whined “Guys please tell me you weren’t just fucking in my bedroom”.</p><p>“I didn’t even get the tip in, that carpet muncher cock-blocked me” she heard Ralph protest from behind her.</p><p>Well that was enough of that Rio decided, making a beeline for the bathroom before she got fucking violent. She needed to be out of this conversation. Right fucking now.</p><p>Leaning her head against the cool tile wall beside the bathtub Rio fought to keep her drinks down. She knew seeing Agatha with her boyfriend shouldn’t make her feel physically ill. Definitely not a normal friend response, but Rio hadn’t had normal friend feelings for Agatha for a while now.</p><p>She can’t pinpoint the exact moment her feelings changed, all she can remember is one day she looked at Agatha and recognized the clenching in her chest for what it was. She hasn’t been able to shake the feeling since.</p><p>So yeah, seeing Agatha seconds away from being fucked from behind by her rich prick boyfriend was upsetting to say the least.</p><p>It’s not like Rio even had a shot. Agatha had made that much clear, scrunching her nose like she had just smelled something disgusting when Ralph and his friends had dared Agatha to kiss her after they found out she was a lesbian.</p><p>“Stop being perverts we aren’t doing that” Agatha had snapped at them, turning to Rio and rolling her eyes like it was the most ridiculous thing she had ever heard.</p><p>It shouldn’t have hurt, Rio hated when men acted like that, fetishizing her sexuality. She should have felt grateful that Agatha shut it down so quickly. She should’ve told Ralph and his loser friends to get the fuck out of her apartment. But instead she felt a pang of sadness.</p><p>That night after the party was over and almost everyone had cleared out of her apartment she was left alone with Agatha. They worked in silence cleaning up cups and bottles, collecting throw pillows that were strewn onto the ground used as makeshift seats.</p><p>“I’m sorry about them” Agatha said, handing Rio an empty six pack carton to put in the recycling. “I swear Ralph can be sweet, his friends just egg him on, he isn’t always an asshole” she explained.</p><p>Rio hummed, unconvinced, picking up a half empty beer bottle. “Why would-” she started, not sure how to word her next question without seeming too invested in the answer. “Why would they think that is something you would even do, I mean have you ever - or well do you... like girls?”</p><p>She felt Agatha stiffen beside her. She turned towards Rio and let out a loud chuckle, too loud for how quiet the room had become. “What would make you think that?” Her icy blue eyes cutting into Rios “not everyone is like you”.</p><p>Rio stepped back like Agatha had slapped her. She blinked away the tears that threatened to overflow and said “Okay Agatha, I think we are done here. I’ll finish cleaning up” she gestured towards the door “you can head out”. It wasn’t a suggestion.</p><p>Agatha huffed, turning on her heel and striding out the door without another word. The door slamming behind her.</p><p>Rio feels another wave of nausea hit her as she replays the memory in her mind. That had been almost 6 months ago and she had been avoiding spending any time alone with Agatha since then. More of a challenge than she had thought it would be since they were not only friends with the same people, but also part of the same running club and studying the same program at Northwestern.</p><p>Rio closed her eyes and thumped her head against the tiles, how had she gotten her life so intertwined with Agatha's without even realizing it.</p><p>A light knock on the bathroom door pulled Rio from her internal struggle, her eyes shooting open as she heard Agatha softly say “Rio I really need to talk to you”.</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything for a minute, not sure she was ready to face Agatha in her current state.</p><p>The knock came again, a little harder this time. “Please Rio I know you’re in there just let me in”.</p><p>Rio sighed and made her way to the door, hand on the lock. She was going to regret this.</p>

<p>Agatha burst through the door a flurry of brown curly hair and a lilac dress so sinfully short that Rio had to tear her eyes away from the expanse of pale skin on display as she walked past her into the bathroom.</p><p>“Rio I am so sorry, okay obviously you weren’t supposed to walk in on us but Ralph shouldn’t have called you that”</p><p>Rio shut the door relatching the lock and slowly turned to Agatha, “Shouldn’t have called me what?” She asked, aiming to make Agatha at least a little uncomfortable having to repeat her boyfriend's preferred term of endearment for Rio.</p><p>Agatha eyes darted from Rio’s down to the ground, a slight flush rising up her chest, “a carpet muncher” she murmered.</p><p>Rio barked out a laugh, startling Agatha “Do you even know what that means Agatha?”</p><p>”Of course I do, I’m not an idiot Rio”</p><p>“Okay let's hear it then” Rio goaded.</p><p>Agatha looked like a deer in the headlights, clearly not ready for the turn this conversation had taken. “Well it means- it um - it means that you… you um- you” she stuttered.</p><p>“It means I eat pussy Agatha” Rio deadpanned. “Something I doubt your boyfriend even knows how to do” she continued, “or do well anyways” she said under her breath.</p><p>Agatha's eyes were piercing, pupils blown wide when they locked on Rio’s. Her cheeks were pink, maybe more than before, was she…blushing? Rio shook her head slightly, she must be drunker than she thought, her mind was playing tricks on her.</p><p>“Not really the insult he thinks it is” Agatha murmurs. Her eyes widened like she hadn’t meant to say that out loud. “ He- um he knows how to do… that” she tries to recover.</p><p>“Okay Agatha” Rio repeats the same words she said to her nearly 6 months ago. She paused for a moment, “you should really consider locking the door if you’re planning on fucking at a party with this many people”.</p><p>“I wasn’t planning on fucking” Agatha protested.</p><p>“Really? Seemed like he almost had the tip in” Rio snarked, repeating Ralph’s words back to her.</p><p>Agatha sighed “Look he was just horny and relentless, it's easier to just do it and get on with the night” she sounded exasperated.</p><p>“Romantic” Rio snorted.</p><p>“Look, you just don’t get it because you don’t have a-” Agatha paused “girlfriend” she choked out.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, “if I did have a girlfriend I wouldn’t be fucking her just to get on with the night, trust me” she said with a smirk.</p><p>”If I had a girlfriend” Rio continued “fucking her would be the best part of my night. I would make her beg for it. Beg for my tongue, my fingers” She flexed her hands “I would give her whatever she asked for as long as she asked nicely”.</p><p>”I would-” Rio started.</p><p>“That’s enough” Agatha cut her off. “I get it”.</p><p>“Anyways I’m here to say sorry. I’m sorry he said it, I’m sorry if it hurt your feelings. I’m just sorry” Agatha says, sounding defeated.</p><p>Rio paused, “why isn’t he here apologizing himself?” she asked.</p><p>Agatha was looking at the floor again. Rio laughed, she knows the answer and it's because he’s not sorry. Ralph Bohner does not give a fuck about Rio or her feelings and Rio doesn’t give a fuck about him right back. All they have in common is Agatha, unfortunately.</p><p>“You know what, it’s fine, I’m sure he says worse behind my back”</p><p>Agatha opens her mouth like she is about to protest but quickly closes it again.</p><p>Ha, that’s what Rio thought. Not sure why she is suddenly feeling vindicated about Agatha admitting her boyfriend is calling her slurs behind her back but at least she clocked it. A win is a win.</p><p>“Look I should get back out there” Agatha says brushing past Rio, her fingertips grazing Rio's waist to move her out of the way. “I’ll see you in poly sci on Monday?” Agatha said hopefully.</p><p>Rio nodded “yeah, sure see you on Monday”. Agatha gave her a soft smile opening the door and walking back out of the bathroom, the sound of the music filtering in more clearly now.</p><p>Rio turned to look at herself in the mirror. Her hazel brown eyes staring back at her looking sadder than they had an hour ago. She pushed her black hair back behind her ears and cleaned the edges of her winged eyeliner. Time to suck it up and face her friends.</p><p>She straightened her shoulders and pulled the door open the rest of the way, walking back out into the party.</p><p>She passed the kitchen where Wanda was flirting with Vision, curling her red hair around her fingers again and again.</p><p>Down the hall she caught sight of Alice’s blue fringe moving into the living room. Her roommate, who also happened to be her best friend, was constantly changing her hair-  but only the tips. Dyeing them increasingly concerning colours month after month.</p><p>Rio smiled fondly, following the vibrant fringe into the living room. Once she got there Alice was laid back against the plush pink couch with her arm around Jen, a dopey grin on her face.</p><p>How the fuck was everyone except Rio on the verge of getting laid tonight.</p><p>She walked up to the couple, “Should I assume I’m making my way home on my own tonight” she winked at Alice.</p><p>Alice grinned at her and Jen swatted at her legs from the couch. “I’ll take that as a yes” Rio laughed and gave her friends a salute as she turned to head back to her own apartment.</p><p>Rio moved into the front hall pulling her doc martens onto her feet and her leather jacket from the closet. It was only October so it wasn’t too cold for her go-to lesbian gear, plus it was almost Halloween and Rio loved Halloween.</p><p>As she moved towards the door she spotted Agatha and Ralph arguing on the front steps, she pulled the door open just in time to hear Ralph mutter “I don’t get why you had to say anything to her, you could’ve just left i-” he stopped mid sentence when he saw Rio step outside.</p><p>Agatha turned to her with a bright overly cheerful smile “Goodnight Rio”, Rio smirked back at her,“yeah goodnight Agatha”</p><p>She saw Agatha bump Ralph’s arm prompting him to say goodbye, he looked utterly unimpressed as he turned to Rio, “Night Vidal” he said, lips twisting like he was eating something sour.</p><p>“Night Bohner.” Rio said, moving her hand to jerk off an imaginary dick in front of her.</p><p>A sharp laugh escaped Agatha’s mouth that she tried to hide with a cough.</p><p>Rio turned making her way down the rest of the stairs as Ralph scowled at her.</p><p>When she got back to her apartment it was quiet. She was alone again. Lately she was always alone.</p><p>She felt a pang of jealousy thinking of Alice and Jen, why couldn’t she have what they had. Why couldn’t someone want her like that? Her mind drifted to Agatha and her short dress, the way it clung to her hips and her chest, the way the soft lilac made her eyes look ocean blue, the blush on her cheeks and her chest. Rio could get lost in it all.</p><p>She shook her head. God what the fuck was wrong with her. She had walked in on Agatha about to fuck her boyfriend and was now fantasizing about… what… a life with her? Get a fucking grip Vidal.</p><p>She needed to sleep, and sober up, and seriously consider her life decisions.</p>

<p>Rio tossed her bag into the passenger seat of her 2002 Honda Civic. Far from glamorous but it got her where she needed to go.</p><p>She only had 2 classes on Monday mornings so taking the bus hardly felt worthwhile. As she pulled up to the political science building her chest tightened, thinking back to the conversation with Agatha in the bathroom on Saturday night.</p><p>She had spent most of Sunday with a hangover so bad that the minimal brain power she had left went towards microwaving ramen and watching reality TV, not spiraling out over Agatha Harkness.</p><p>Maybe Agatha had been more drunk than her, maybe she had completely forgotten their conversation. Wishful thinking and all.</p><p>Throwing the car into park she grabbed her bag and made her way into the lecture hall, spotting Lilias curly platinum hair piled on top of her head in a messy bun. Her hair was so blonde it almost looked white under the fluorescent lighting.</p><p>“Rioooo” she sing-songed waving her over to the empty seat beside her. Rio smiled sliding into the stiff lecture hall seat. She pulled her laptop out of her bag, still smiling. She enjoyed this class. Truthfully she enjoyed most of her classes, she was a bit of a nerd…so sue her.</p><p>Intro to political theory was a second year class taught by a no-nonsense professor named Dr. Wilkins, she wore her hair in a low slicked back bun and a different coloured suit almost every class. Rio couldn’t help but admire her, the way she commanded the room, the sly grin that graced her face when she made a point that not even the most argumentative of her students could refute. Okay, so she may have a bit of a crush, so what.</p><p>“Helloooo earth to Rio” Lilia snapped her fingers in front of Rio’s face, breaking her train of thought. “I said how was Saturday? You know I would’ve come but my Nonna…” she trailed off. Rio knew her Nonna was sick, she seemed to be having more bad days than good lately.</p><p>She reached over to give Lilia’s arm a comforting squeeze. “You didn’t miss anything, trust me” she rolled her eyes. Lilia’s eyebrows shot up at Rio’s sarcastic drawl, “seems like maybe I did?” She asked.</p><p>Rio glanced around quickly, making sure Agatha wasn’t in the lecture hall yet. “I walked in on Bohner with, well, with his boner out.”</p><p>“Yuck” Lilia grimaced, she held the same distaste for Agatha’s boyfriend that Rio did.</p><p>“Yeah” Rio said shaking her head, “he called me a carpet muncher and then spent the rest of the night fighting with Agatha.”</p><p>Lilia hummed, “I prefer the term kitty puncher” amusement clear in her voice.</p><p>“Lilia why the fuck would you prefer that, it makes it sound like you literally hit animals” Rio asked incredulously.</p><p>“You just don’t see the vision” Lilia sniffed, turning her nose up at Rio.</p><p>Rio felt the air shift as a body dropped down in the seat next to her. Agatha's mane of hair brushed against Rios forearm as she bent forward to grab her laptop. Thank god Rio was wearing long sleeves so the goosebumps on her arms weren’t visible.</p><p>“What are we talking about?” Agatha asked curiously.</p><p>“Slurs” Lilia chirped as if it was a completely normal topic of conversation.</p><p>Agatha's mouth fell open, brain clearly buffering at the unexpected response. She didn’t get the chance to say anything else, Dr Wilkins' voice interrupting their conversation as she began the lecture.</p><p>The last 20 minutes of the lecture was always spent in breakout groups discussing a core question. The class was small so Rio ended up in a group with either Lilia or Agatha half of the time. Today it was Agatha. Of course.</p><p>Her group was discussing the issue of values in modern political theory. To Rio it seemed obvious, the science of policy could exist without the impact of personal values but as soon as you attach a person to those policies values and feelings tend to get involved.</p><p>Agatha seemed to take issue with this answer, tapping her acrylic nails on the desk impatiently while she waited for Rio to finish.</p><p>“You know not everything is personal, politicians can pass bills that don’t align with their own personal agenda”.</p><p>Rio shot her a skeptical look, “Oh yeah, like how your mom does?”</p><p>Agatha's mother was a republican senator, notorious for her hateful rhetoric which was clearly reflected in the anti-trans and anti-immigration bills she was constantly trying to pass.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened, expression hardening. She clearly had not expected Rio to go there in front of their classmates. “My mother is just playing the game, she is aligning with her party, not just doing whatever the hell she feels like”.</p><p>“Oh so the outspoken support of the don’t say gay bill was just her playing the game? C’mon Agatha those kinds of bills don’t get support in Illinois for a reason” Rio scoffed.</p><p>Agatha looked taken aback.</p><p>Okay, so Rio had done her homework on the Harkness family. She couldn’t help herself. When Jen first introduced her to Agatha she could hardly get a read on the girl. Agatha slipped in and out of a mask of indifference, letting little parts of herself spill through the cracks every time she snorted out a laugh or rolled her eyes or looked tearfully at a stray cat down the street. She was an endlessly confusing person, Rio wondered sometimes if she even had herself figured out.</p><p>“That’s all for today everyone, next class we will share the key points of each groups discussion with the class” Dr. Wilkins clapped her hands with finality.</p><p>Before Rio could turn back around in her seat she heard Agatha pushing herself up and watched her practically sprint towards the door of the lecture hall.</p><p>“Fuck” Rio muttered under her breath. Maybe she had come on a little strong given the setting. It wasn’t Agatha's fault her mom was a bigot.</p><p>She let her head drop back against the seat looking up at the speckled ceiling. How did she keep managing to say the wrong fucking thing.</p><p>She wasn’t trying to ruin her friendship with Agatha, or what was left of it anyways. The one sided homoerotic feelings really weren’t helping though, they were making Rio messy. She was going to give herself away any day now. If any of her friends called her bluff she would surely crack.</p><p>She pushed herself out of the chair with a deep sigh and made her way to the same door Agatha had fled through. Lilia shot her a strange look, flicking her eyebrow up in an unspoken question.</p><p>Rio waved her hand to brush her off, she made this mess, she was going to deal with it herself.</p><p>As she walked out into the hallway she saw the door to the women’s bathroom still swinging slightly on its hinges, it was worth a try. She wasn’t sure where else Agatha would have gone so quickly.</p><p>“Agatha?” She called out as she pushed the door to the bathroom open. The stalls were all empty except for one.</p><p>She heard a quiet sniffle as she approached the door. “Agatha are you in there?” she tried again softly.</p><p>“What do you want Rio?” She asked, her voice cracking slightly. “Weren’t done with me yet? Had to come back for seconds?”</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows shot up, clearly Agatha hadn’t meant it as an innuendo but it made her mouth water nonetheless. What she wouldn’t give for a serving of Agatha, she wouldn’t stop at seconds, she would come back for thirds and fourths. Truthfully she would take as many rounds as Agatha would let her have.</p><p>She heard shifting behind the stall door and the click of a lock pulled her out of her twisted reverie. She wanted to smack herself upside the head. She was supposed to be here comforting Agatha, making amends. Instead, she was getting turned on at the thought of getting into her pants.</p><p>Agatha pulled the door open almost violently, leaving her and Rio standing inches apart from each other. Rios' breath hitched at the proximity and she prayed to a god that she didn’t believe in that Agatha hadn’t heard it.</p><p>Agatha's eyes were rimmed red and her lips were swollen like she had been biting down on them to keep herself quiet. Rio's stomach dropped. Fuck fuck fuck. She had been crying. Rio had made her cry.</p><p>“We really need to stop meeting like this” Agatha said stoically.</p><p>Rio had to bite back a laugh, somehow it was the last thing she had expected Agatha to say.</p><p>“Well I guess the difference is last time you were apologizing, this time it's my turn” Rio said earnestly trying to make eye contact.</p><p>They were still standing so close to each other that Rio could feel Agatha’s breathing even out and she finally looked up at Rio.</p><p>“Well, go on then”.</p>

<p>Rio took a step back to let Agatha out of the stall, she was not going to be able to say what she needed to say with Agatha standing so close to her.</p><p>Agatha brushed past her, she smelled like lavender and bergamot. Rio tried not to inhale too deeply.</p><p>As she moved to the sink to wash her hands Rio turned to look at her reflection in the bathroom mirror.</p><p>“Look” she started, “I shouldn’t have said that in front of everyone”.</p><p>Agatha looked up, eyes locking on hers in the mirror, it was easier to be honest this way.</p><p>“You aren’t your mother, her opinions aren’t yours” Rio’s shoulders slumped forward “that wasn’t how I meant it, i’m sorry”.</p><p>“And if I agreed with her” Agatha questioned, “what then? would that be so bad?”</p><p>Rio let out a huff in disbelief, “would being a racist, homophobic bigot be so bad?” She paused giving Agatha a chance to take it back, “yes, Agatha, yes it would be”.</p><p>“God, you have a such a superiority complex” Agatha rolled her eyes in annoyance, “i’m not saying I agree with her” she mumbled. “She is just doing what she thinks is right” she explained, trying to shrug it off.</p><p>“And what do you think is right?”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter what I think”. Agatha scoffed.</p><p>“What’s wrong in the eyes of the lord will always be wrong” she says, slender fingers curling into air quotes while doing her best Evanora impression. Frighteningly accurate, Rio thought to herself.</p><p>“I can see why her and Ralph would get along” Rio quipped.</p><p>Agatha whipped around, her curly mane nearly smacking Rio in the face in the process. She adjusted the collar of her blue button down. It was tucked into tan khakis, a black belt cinching her waist.</p><p>“Look I already apologized about Ralph, I don’t know what else you want me to say”.</p><p>“Why are you even with him?” Rio asked, she knew she was testing her limits but fuck it, Agatha was already mad at her anyways.</p><p>“He’s a good lay” Agatha deadpanned.</p><p>“I’m serious Agatha, do you really want to be with someone that you have to apologize for? Someone who can’t even own up to their shit?”</p><p>Agatha just blinked back at her, taking a slow step forward invading Rio’s space.</p><p>“As opposed to who Rio? Tell me, who is it I should be with instead of him?”</p><p>Another step forward, they are inches apart again and the tension is almost too much for Rio to bear. She took a step back, an attempt to create some distance between them but her body collided with the wall of the bathroom stall.</p><p>Agathas mouth twisted into a smirk, she looked like a predator who had finally cornered her prey.</p><p>“Say it Rio, who should I be with” she goaded. Rio didn’t respond just wrung her hands together as she swallowed, her throat bobbing. It must have caught Agatha’s attention because her sharp blue eyes flickered briefly down Rio’s neck before meeting her eyes again.</p><p>“Speaking of people who can’t own up to their shit” Agatha laughed cruelly. She shifted forward, as if she was ready to take another step when Rio lifted her palm between them, pressing on Agatha’s stomach to stop her. She felt Agatha’s muscles tense at the touch, her eyes widening briefly as she looked down between them at the hand that was now connecting them. For a split second Agatha leaned into the touch, allowing Rio’s fingertips to curl into the fabric of her shirt.</p><p>“What are you doing Agatha?” Rio asked</p><p>Agatha faltered as if she hadn’t realized she had cornered Rio. Her eyes darted around the room wildly as she took a quick step back. “I was just- I uh, I was just...” She shook her head and laughed nervously.</p><p>What the fuck was going on. Rio felt like she was losing her mind. Why was Agatha acting so skittish? She almost looked…guilty?</p><p>“Defending yourself?” Rio asked in an attempt to fill in the blank and squash the tension that had filled the room.</p><p>Agatha nodded too quickly, “exactly-” she started, and was abruptly cut off by her phone ringing loudly, the lyrics to Kiss Me Thru the Phone echoing through the bathroom.</p><p>Rio gave her a funny look as she scrambled to pull her phone out of her pocket. Who the fuck even used custom ringtones anymore? And really? Soulja Boy?</p><p>The name Ralph lit up the screen. Rio snickered, there was no emoji, no mushy nickname, no last name, just ‘Ralph’. She didn’t even have a picture of him on his contact photo it was just a gray R.</p><p>“What” Agatha snapped as she picked up the phone. Jesus Christ, Rio did not want to be on the receiving end of that tone.</p><p>“Are you serious Ralph? I told you I need to bring my portfolio home, there is no way I can take it on the bus with me…” she worried her bottom lip between her teeth, her crimson lipstick smudging in the corner as she listened to her boyfriend on the other end of the line. “Okay okay, fine whatever, I’ll just take an Uber or something” she swiftly hung up the phone without saying goodbye.</p><p>The irritation Agatha was currently exuding made Rio more than a little bit scared to open her mouth. She was sure she was going to regret what she was about to say anyways.</p><p>“I could drive you home” Rio blurted before she could overthink it.</p><p>Agatha paused, looking up from her phone screen, “really?” She sounded genuinely surprised.</p><p>“Uh- of course,” Rio stuttered, “what are friends for?”.</p><p>It sounded more like a question than a statement so she ended it with a smile hoping she could avoid Agatha’s wrath.</p><p>“I just have one more class but I’ll be done by 11 if you can wait?”</p><p>Agatha considered her for another moment before nodding. “Can we meet at the art building?”</p><p>“Is THE Agatha Harkness taking an art class?” Rio asked, hand clutching her chest as if scandalized.</p><p>“And what if I am Vidal?” Agatha challenged, a fire sparking in her eyes.</p><p>“I guess I’ll have to see if you’re any good” Rio shrugged. A slight brush crept onto Agatha’s cheeks, “I guess so” she murmered in return.</p>

<p>Rio hadn’t spent much time in the art building. She had toured it when she first visited campus but had been there maybe once or twice since, usually meeting Alice after a class.</p><p>She had been sitting on the green outside the building, staining the edges of her converse in the grass since 11:05. After another 5 minutes with Agatha nowhere to be found she decided to make her way inside.</p><p>She strolled through the halls housing different art pieces and student projects, not exactly sure where Agatha would be so she stopped briefly to glance in the windows of each class room and studio that she passed.</p><p>She turned the corner and stopped dead in her tracks. Agatha was sitting on the stool in the studio directly across from Rio. She had her hair in a messy bun piled on top of her heard making her curls look even more chaotic, wisping around her face in all directions. She was turned to face the desk only her profile visible to Rio. Her normally sharp jawline softened by the rays of midmorning sunlight peaking through the large studio windows. The real star of the show though, was the pair of thick framed black glasses that sat at the bridge of her hooked nose, her eyebrows furrowed slightly in concentration. Rio gulped, keenly aware of the heat stirring in her stomach. God Agatha looked good in glasses.</p><p>As if she could hear Rios thoughts Agatha’s head snapped up looking in the direction of the doorway, Rio wondered briefly is she had actually said that out loud.</p><p>A slow smile broke across Agatha’s face and she raised a charcoal covered hand beckoning Rio to come in. Rio stood frozen in the hallway for a moment not wanting to break the spell the moment had cast on her.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head slightly, clearly confused by Rio’s hesitation.</p><p>“Ready to head out?” Rio asked when she was close enough for Agatha to hear without raising her voice.</p><p>Agatha pointed to the stool next to hers, motioning for Rio to sit down. Pushing the glasses to rest on the top of her head with her clean wrist.</p><p>As she slid onto the stool she caught a glimpse of what Agatha had been working on. It was a detailed charcoal sketch of an almond shaped eye, a thick set of lashs offsetting the delicate detail of the iris.</p><p>Agatha quickly closed the sketchbook shuffling the other sketches around her on top of what she had been working on. “Just give me 2 minutes I need to grab everything from my portfolio” she paused, “and get cleaned up” she said wiggling her charcoal covered fingers in the air.</p><p>Rio just nodded, watching as Agatha moved around the room with ease. She had never really seen her like this. She seemed almost serene, collecting up her supplies and various pieces of art she had clearly been working on or had already finished.</p><p>Something about the situation made Rio mildly uncomfortable. Maybe it was the way she couldn’t tear her eyes away from Agatha’s hands as she lathered each finger individually in the sink, rubbing up and down until the residue from the charcoal was gone completely. Rio shifted in her seat, leaning against the cold stone countertop to ground herself.</p><p>“So what are you up to for the rest of the day?” Agatha asked, making easy conversation, clearly not sensing Rio’s inner turmoil.</p><p>“Well, I have softball practice at 4” Rio said “and a virgin sacrifice at 5” she finished with a smirk.</p><p>“I knew it” Agatha said grinning.</p><p>”Which the softball or the sacrifice?” Rio asked.</p><p>“The softball obviously, you’re such a lesbian.”</p><p>“Hey” Rio protested, “Jen is just as gay as me”, if not gayer she thought to herself, “and she doesn’t play softball”.</p><p>”Yeah but Jen is Jen” Agatha said pointedly.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes “Okay Georgia O’Keeffe, are you almost ready to go”</p><p>Agatha shot her a strange look. “Who is that?” she said.</p><p>“You should look her up, I think you’d like her style” Rio smirked.</p><p>”Okay…sure” Agatha said suspiciously.</p><p>“Can you help me with this” Agatha said, voice strained as she tried to move a large canvas out of her way.</p><p>Rio stepped in, rolling up the sleeves of her oversized white button up. Her forearms flexed as she lifted the piece out of Agatha’s way so she could grab the rest of her supplies.</p><p>Agatha stepped back with her last two pieces of canvas, her eyes trailing from Rio’s converse covered feet up to her forearms, still flexed holding the heavy piece of art. Eventually meeting her eyes, an unreadable look on her face.</p><p>“You okay?” Rio asked quickly.</p><p>Agatha simply hummed in response, passing Rio various pieces from her portfolio to carry out to to the car.</p><p>Rio took a moment to actually look at the pieces in her hand for the first time. They were undeniably good.</p><p>“ Agatha, these are…” She trailed off, not quite sure how to finish that sentence.</p><p>“I know” Agatha sighed “they aren’t the best but I enjoy it okay” she said defensively.</p><p>“That’s not what I was going to say” Rio argued, “I was going to say these are good”. Pouring as much sincerity into her expression as she could.</p><p>It took Agatha a moment and then a genuine smile spread across her face. “Well I’m no Georgia O’Keeffe” she joked.</p><p>“I thought you didn’t kno who that was” Rio said with a raised brow.</p><p>“Just help me carry these out to the car” Agatha said as she rolled her eyes.</p><p>Who was Rio to deny her? She took every piece that Agatha passed her, tossing her bag over her should as she followed Agatha out of the room.</p><p>The locks on the Honda clicked as Rio approached the car pressing on the key fob repeatedly, it usually took 3 to 4 tries for the doors to actually unlock.</p><p>If Agatha had an opinion about her old ass car she didn’t voice it, she simply opened the passenger side door and slipped inside after gently placing her portfolio pieces in the back seat. Rio did the same on her side.</p><p>As the car chugged to life the radio turned on, automatically blaring the last CD Rio had been playing, Somebody Told Me by the Killers ringing through the speakers.</p><p>“So is this the kind of music you’re into?” She asked, her tone neutral but Rio could see through it.</p><p>“I don’t know, personally I think its better than Kiss Me Thru the Phone” she quipped.</p><p>Agatha let out a sharp laugh. She shook her head her blue eyes glimmering in the sun reflecting off the dashboard.</p><p>There was a moment of silence before Agatha professed, “I didn’t set that ringtone, I’ve never listened to Soulja boy in my life” she said almost gleefully.</p><p>“That makes two of us” Rio grinned as she tossed the car into drive and peeled out of the parking lot.</p>

<p>Two minutes into the ride Agatha was humming along to the Killers, her knee bouncing to the beat in the passenger seat.</p><p>“I thought you didn’t like the Killers” Rio teased.</p><p>“I never said that” Agatha said, lips pulling up at the corners.</p><p>”So what kind of music does the great Agatha Harkness listen to anyways”</p><p>Agatha looked suddenly shy at what Rio thought was a rather simple question to answer. Rio’s eyes left the road flicking to meet Agatha’s, prompting her with a raised brow.</p><p>“I like a lot of different stuff” she trails off, “growing up my mom wouldn’t really let me listen to a lot of music, she always said it was unholy or blasphemous” she shakes her head, bottom lip pulled between her teeth. “I really like ABBA” she blurts out.</p><p>Rio snorts out a laugh “Okay dancing queen” she jokes.</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrows slightly “are you making fun of me?”</p><p>Rio’s face softened, “no, I like ABBA too” she pauses “never needed a man after midnight though” she chuckles.</p><p>“Me neither” Agatha agreed absentmindedly.</p><p>Rio scrunched her nose at that, “I meant because I’m a lesbian”. Rio really needed to stop wasting her best material on a straight girl who kept missing the punchline.</p><p>“Oh yeah…that makes sense” Agatha nodded, but she didn’t take it back.</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>The conversation lulled and Rio decided to take mercy on Agatha and change the subject.</p><p>“So, why couldn’t Ralph pick you up?” She tried to keep the bitterness out of her voice as she asked.</p><p>“Ughhhh” Agatha groaned. “Roommate emergency” she said as if that was a clear explanation.</p><p>When Rio just looked at her dumbfounded, she clarified, “which probably means Vision needed help picking up kegs for their Halloween party this weekend” she explained rolling her eyes.</p><p>Agatha perked up in her seat, “You should come”.</p><p>Rio paused.</p><p>“Come to your boyfriend's Halloween party?” Rio had to ask, not sure she had heard right the first time.</p><p>“Yes, duh, all of our friends will be there”.</p><p>”Agatha, I can almost guarantee Ralph does not want me in his house” she looked at her incredulously.</p><p>“Well I want you there. So he can cope” Agatha said with finality. “Besides, you love Halloween”.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t wrong, Rio loved Halloween. She was surprised Agatha had remembered.</p><p>“Okay” Rio said hesitantly, “I’ll consider it”.</p><p>“You’re a tough nut to smash Vidal” Agatha said with a smirk.</p><p>“It’s crack”</p><p>“What's crack?” Agatha said confused.</p><p>“The saying” Rio explained “it’s tough nut to crack”</p><p>Agatha turned in her seat, smacking Rio in the arm “Shut up, nerd”.</p><p>“It’s common knowledge” Rio muttered under her breath. Her arm tingling where Agatha’s had touched hers.</p><p>Agatha’s arm came to rest on the center console, body still turned to face Rio. Her fingertips lightly brushed the edge of Rio’s coat. She wasn’t actually touching her but Rio felt like her skin was on fire anyways.</p><p>Rio licked her lips, trying to focus on the road as she turned the corner onto Agatha’s street. “What are you dressing up as?” She asked, hoping for a distraction from the reaction her body was having to Agatha’s proximity.</p><p>“Ralph wants to do a couples costume” Agatha wrinkled her nose. “But I want to go as Aphrodite” she said with a shrug.</p><p>Rio swallowed hard, mind flicking to images of Agatha dressed up as the Greek goddess. Brunette locks flowing long and free down her back, draped in white cloth clinging to her body in all the right places. She could picture pink nipples poking through the light fabric, material wrapping itself between luscious thighs.</p><p>Okay that mental image was really not helping Rio’s current situation. She shifted slightly in her seat, pressing her thighs together to relieve the growing pressure at their apex. She needed to get a grip right fucking now.</p><p>In her haze she almost missed Agatha asking “what about you?”</p><p>Rio snapped back to reality just in time to slam on the brakes to avoid running a stop sign, very nearly avoiding crashing into the car that was now in the middle of the intersection.</p><p>Agatha jolted forward at the sudden stop, one hand slamming on the dashboard to support herself while the other flew to Rio’s thigh, squeezing tightly.</p><p>“Oh my god” Rio breathed out, “I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to” she stuttered, becoming keenly aware of Agatha’s hand resting on her thigh.</p><p>Rio gulped when instead of pulling her hand away, Agatha started slowly moving her thumb in soothing circles.</p><p>Her eyes bugged out of her head, turning to look at Agatha who was wearing a calm expression.</p><p>“Hey, it’s okay, it was an accident” she paused, locking eyes with Rio “we’re fine” she reassured.</p><p>Rio nodded, heart rate slowing slightly. “Right” she said throat suddenly dry, “we’re fine” she repeated more for herself than anyone else.</p><p>She slowly removed her foot from the brakes, letting the car glide forward into the now empty intersection.</p><p>Agatha moved to sit back in the seat, twisting her knees away from Rio to face forward. To Rio’s surprise her hand stayed put. She had stopped moving her thumb but her hand was still resting on Rio’s thigh, it felt like it was burning a hole through her jeans.</p><p>It stayed that way for the rest of the short drive to Agatha’s house. Rio pulled up out front, putting the car into park.</p><p>“Let me help you take your stuff inside” Rio said, not giving Agatha the option to struggle through it on her own.</p><p>She didn’t put up a fight, simply nodded and finally pulled her hand from Rio’s thigh to grab her bag on the ground in the passenger seat.</p><p>They both opened the back doors of the car pulling out the pieces of Agatha’s portfolio on either side.</p><p>Agatha fumbled with her keys at the front door, hands so full she could barely turn the key in the lock.</p><p>“Wanda not home?” Rio wondered aloud.</p><p>“Nope, she’s in seminar until 3” Agatha explained, finally pushing the door open.</p><p>Rio hadn’t been to Agatha and Wanda’s house since the summer, she was hit with a scent that was so uniquely Agatha it was like Wanda didn’t even actually live here.</p><p>Almost as if she had read her mind, Agatha turned to her “Not that she is here that much anyways, her and Vision are practically attached at the hip now” she explained.</p><p>Rio just hummed in response, following Agatha through the hallway towards her bedroom.</p><p>Rio had never been in Agatha’s room and she felt a shiver run down her spine at the idea of being alone in Agatha’s space with her.</p><p>Agatha pushed the door open revealing a bright room with an oak desk facing the arched window and a matching bed frame. The walls were painted a light lilac and the bed was covered in purple throw pillows of various shades on top of a white duvet with purple flowers embroidered at the base. It was all so very Agatha.</p><p>She paused at the door, lingering just outside of the room not wanting to invade.</p><p>Agatha who was already standing at the desk by the window turned around to look at her.</p><p>“Well don’t just stand there like a lurker, come in” she joked.</p><p>Rio forced a smile that she hoped didn’t look too nervous and stepped into the bedroom.</p>

<p>Agatha turned back to face her desk as Rio walked into her bedroom for the first time.</p><p>She hadn’t cleaned anything up, she really hadn’t been expecting Rio to drop her off. Luckily her bed was made and yesterday was laundry day so her hamper wasn’t overflowing.</p><p>She took a deep breath to center herself as Rio approached her desk.</p><p>She heard the pieces in Rio’s hand as they were gently place on the desk beside her.</p><p>She looked up and Rio was watching her with almond shaped hazel eyes. She didn’t miss how Rio’s pupils briefly dilated as her eyes met Agatha’s.</p><p>Rio’s eyes quickly darted away, taking in Agatha’s room for the first time.</p><p>“Cute” she said, pointing to the stuffed bunny sitting amongst the excessive collection of throw pillows.</p><p>“That’s señor scratchy” Agatha responded matter of factly. Rio was already in her room, might as well be honest about what she was seeing.</p><p>Rio turned to her with an amused look on her face, “Why is your stuffed animal Spanish?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged “I’ve had him since I was a kid, my nanny Maria and I named him together”</p><p>Maria had been Agatha’s main source of comfort during her childhood.</p><p>Her mother was seldom there and when she had been it was to reign terror down on her. To tell Agatha she wasn’t godly enough, wasn’t thoughtful enough, wasn’t thin enough, wasn’t pretty enough. Wasn’t enough. Period.</p><p>Agatha had always considered herself an ambitious person, so if it was within her power she was going to fix it.</p><p>She really had given it her best shot. She started going to church 3 times a week, stopped speaking out of line. She shrunk into herself. She tried to make herself as small as possible.</p><p>She started wearing makeup, and chasing after good catholic boys, and always saying please and thank you -  even to people who didn’t deserve it. She became the prodigal daughter, everything her mother had surely prayed for. And it still wasn’t enough.</p><p>Nothing was ever enough for Evanora unless everyone around her was as miserable as she was, Agatha had learned this too from a young age.</p><p>So yeah, Agatha alone in her bedroom with a lesbian, Evanora would’ve had an aneurism.</p><p>Rio, clearly unaware of Agatha’s inner turmoil rolled her head to the side to scan the rest of the room, the movement causing her wavy black hair to fall to the side cascading down her back exposing the column of her throat.</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, tearing her eyes away from the newly exposed skin.</p><p>“Tu habitación es muy morada” Rio said, gesturing to the colour of the walls and the throw pillows on the bed.</p><p>Agatha’s brain short circuited, she had never heard Rio speak Spanish before. The way it rolled off Rio’s tongue sparked an unexplainable heat low in Agatha's stomach.</p><p>She must have looked surprised as Rio turned back towards her, “My family is from Puerto Rico, I pretty much exclusively spoke Spanish with them growing up” she explained.</p><p>Agatha simply nodded, not trusting her voice not to crack if she dared to open her mouth.</p><p>“I was just saying this room is very purple” she explained at Agatha’s lack of response.</p><p>Rio started to move around the room, taking in more and more of Agatha as she went.</p><p>It was nerve wracking, standing there just watching her. So Agatha busied herself with her portfolio pieces, pretending to organize them on the desk so she didn’t have to see what Rio was looking at.</p><p>“Agatha” Rio said slowly, as if sensing her discomfort. “Do you want me to leave?” she asked earnestly.</p><p>“NO” Agatha said too quickly and definitely too loudly in the otherwise empty apartment.</p><p>“I mean, no, you don’t have to, if uh- if you don’t want to” she said looking at Rio from the corner of eye, bracing herself for the inevitable rejection.</p><p>It’s what she deserves anyways, she had been nothing but cold to Rio lately. That mixed with Ralph’s incessant need to stick his foot in his mouth and her mothers desire to eliminate Rio’s human rights, she wouldn’t blame her if she left. Cut and run, god knows Agatha would.</p><p>“I’d like to stay then” Rio said shyly, not meeting her eyes.</p><p>Agatha watched as Rio moved to sit on the edge of Agatha’s bed. Her breath caught momentarily, something about the contrast of Rio’s black jeans and smoky eyes against the soft lilac hues of Agatha’s room was creating a beautiful contrast that Agatha wasn’t sure how to process.</p><p>A thought like that had never crossed her mind when Ralph sat on her bed. Not even when we was dressed in his nicest black suit. Something about it always felt forced, like they were playing dress up for each other.</p><p>She shook her head, trying to rid herself of the thought. It was just weird, having Rio here, in her room. They just weren’t that close, that was all. That is why seeing her here was making Agatha feel off kilter.</p><p>She pushed through her racing thoughts and moved to sit beside Rio, the bed dipping as she sat a safe distance away. Almost a full arm's length.</p><p>Rio turned to look at her then, doe eyed. “It’s kind of weird seeing this side of you” She admitted, gesturing to the various trinkets and knick knacks scattered around the room, her eyes eventually landing on the bible her mom had forced her to take when she left for college.</p><p>“It’s kind of weird letting you see it” Agatha confessed. Looking down at where Rio’s fingers were tracing the outlines of the embroidered flowers on her bed.</p><p>Something about her lithe fingers idly gliding up and down the stems, swirling around the flower petals, made it hard for Agatha to look away.</p><p>Without any warning Rio flopped backwards onto the bed, staring up at the ceiling. Agatha could smell her perfume then, a mixture of cedar wood and vanilla, she smelled sweet and spicy.</p><p>Ralph never smelled that good, he always smelled like he had just doused himself in axe body spray. Like a boy in elementary school who wasn’t aware of his body odour until his mom pointed it out and was overcompensating by showering himself in deodorant.</p><p>Agatha shifted on the bed, slowly allowing herself to sink backwards, shoulders coming to rest a few inches from Rio’s.</p><p>“So where is your secret stash?” Rio asked micheviously, turning on her side to look at Agatha with her head propped up on her wrist.</p><p>“What are you talking about…” Agatha responded suspiciously. She felt a flush creeping up her chest. It’s not like her drawers were see through, Rio couldn’t possible know about the vibrator nestled in the top drawer of her bedside table.</p><p>“Oh c’mon Agatha, don’t play coy on me now” Rio said, Agatha turned her head to gape at her.</p><p>“I see you smoking at almost every party I’ve been to” Rio arched an eyebrow, “where is your secret weed stash?”</p><p>Agatha let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding. Of course Rio wasn’t talking about a hidden stash of sex toys, what the fuck was wrong with her.</p><p>“Wouldn’t you like to know” she said with a sly smile, still recovering from the slight panic that had risen in her chest.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, propping herself up. “I bet I can find if myself” she said jokingly, rolling over to kneel on the bed reaching across Agatha towards her bedside table.</p><p>The panic was back and in full force. Agatha snatched Rio’s wrist from above her head, pulling it down and away from the handle of the drawer.</p><p>“Don’t” she said sharply.</p><p>The sudden force of Agatha’s movement caused Rio to lose her balance, arms coming down to bracket either side of Agatha’s head to brace herself.</p><p>Agatha sucked in a sharp breath.</p><p>With Rio this close she could see the gold speckles in her brown eyes, dark eyelashes fluttering in surprise.</p><p>Agatha caught a flicker of pink in her peripheral vision, her eyes quickly snapping down to find the source. Rio was running her tongue along her teeth, her lips parted just enough to see the pink tip of it run along the small gap between her front teeth.</p><p>For a moment Agatha wondered how that gap would feel against the tip of her tongue instead. How Rio’s soft lips would part for her, letting her in. Letting her take what she wanted.</p><p>And before she could stop herself she was leaning in. Until Rio’s breath was hot against her face, until she was brushing her lips against Rio’s gently.</p><p>She felt Rio’s body freeze above her, but before she could pull away Rio surged forward pushing Agatha back into the mattress turning the kiss from gentle to bruising. Agatha tried to surpress the soft moan rising in her throat but as Rio’s lips parted to deepen the kiss it escaped.</p><p>Suddenly Rio jolted backwards, as if she had just realized what was actually happening.</p><p>Agatha still hadn’t moved, she refused to meet Rio’s eyes. Instead staring resolutely at the ceiling. It shouldn’t have felt like that. So good.</p><p>They both sat in silence for a moment before Rio broke it with a stutter “I- um- I have a game, I-should… I mean I should go”</p><p>Agatha nodded, “Okay” she said slowly.</p><p>“Are we- um… are we okay?” Rio asked nervously.</p><p>Agatha nodded again giving a non-commital hum. She felt like she was in shock, her brain not allowing any of the words she wanted to say to reach her mouth.</p><p>Rio slipped off the bed, making a beeline for the door.</p><p>“Okay well I’ll see you around I guess” she paused, “maybe this weekend” she said, it sounded more like a question than a statement.</p><p>Agatha simply hummed again. Damn her brain and its inability to produce words.</p><p>Rio slipped through the door without another word, leaving Agatha with her hair sprawled out against the mattress and her head spinning.</p><p>What had she done.</p>

<p>Rio was currently having the crash out of the century.</p><p>She had kissed Agatha. Straight Agatha. Straight Agatha with a boyfriend. If Ralph hadn’t hated her before he surely would now.</p><p>She can imagine him and Agatha cuddled up in bed together laughing about Rio and her sad little crush. Fuck her life.</p><p>Rio wouldn’t allow her mind to drift back to the feeling of Agatha’s lips soft against hers, of the throaty moan she had sworn she heard as she pressed in closer to Agatha. Wouldn’t allow herself to believe that it actually felt like Agatha wanted to kiss her.</p><p>She had spent the last 3 days avoiding Alice out of fear she would be able to tell what had happened from one look at her face. When Alice finally knocked on Rio’s door on Friday morning Rio knew the jig was up.</p><p>“Okay Rio, you’ve gotta tell me what is going on” she paused “are you like, pissed at me or something?”</p><p>Rio let out the breath she was holding in a huff. She was going to have to tell Alice.</p><p>Rio pulled the door open slowly, a sheepish look on her face. “No I’m not mad at you, I’m mad at myself”.</p><p>Alice raised a brow, prompting her to explain herself.</p><p>“I - um, I kissed Agatha”.</p><p>Alice's jaw fell open, eyes widening. “I’m sorry I think I may have gone momentarily deaf because I could’ve sworn I just heard you say you kissed Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>Rio nodded guiltily. She knew this wasn’t going to go over well.</p><p>“The same Agatha, who has a boyfriend that calls both of us dykes behind our backs and an ultra-religious racist cunt for a mother” Alice paused, “we’re talking about that Agatha?”</p><p>“Yes…that Agatha” Rio muttered looking down.</p><p>“Rio…” Alice said softly, moving in to put her hand on Rio’s shoulder, giving it a soft shake urging her to look up.</p><p>“You can’t go there, you know that right?”</p><p>“I know, it shouldn’t have happened” Rio said finally meeting Alice’s eyes, “but Alice it was like she wanted it to happen, one minute we were sitting on her bed talking and laughing and the next thing I know she was leaning in-”</p><p>“Are you sure she wasn’t just reaching for something?” Alice asked sarcastically.</p><p>“Ha ha very funny” Rio deadpanned. “I’m being serious Alice, she technically kissed me first”</p><p>Alices smirk faltered at that, “what do you mean technically?”.</p><p>“I mean it was hardly a kiss, it was soft, barely there” Rio paused “but still nice” she mused to herself.</p><p>“Okay, that is…unexpected”’ Alice paused, “break it down for me, I need to know all of the details before I come to my final conclusion”.</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes “sure thing judge” she said sarcastically, closing the door to her room and making her way towards their living room.</p><p>She flopped down on the couch, Alice joining her shortly after with a bottle of wine and two glasses in hand.</p><p>“Figured you could use this” she said with a smile as she poured them each a glass.</p><p>Rio simply hummed in agreement, taking a healthy sip before she launched into her story.</p><p>“So Ralph was being an asshole as usual” Rio explained as Alice nodded in agreement.</p><p>“He left her at school with this whole art portfolio to bring home by herself so I offered to give her a ride”</p><p>“Very chivalrous” Alice added jokingly.</p><p>“Exactly” Rio agreed. “So I brought her home and helped her carry everything into her room and you know I’ve never been in her room before but it smelled so good like lavender and something citrusy like bergamot.” She rambled.</p><p>“Bergamot?” Alice interrupted “my god you’ve got it bad Rio”.</p><p>Heat rose in Rio’s cheeks at that. “Do you want the full story or not?”</p><p>Alice rose her hands in defense, the red wine sloshing in her glass.</p><p>”Anyways” Rio said with a glare, “she kind of just let me look around her room and she was watching me the whole time with this weird expression. She almost seemed nervous, like it actually mattered what I thought of everything I was seeing”.</p><p>“Maybe she was?” Alice offered.</p><p>“That’s what I thought so I offered to leave but she said no” Rio explained. “So we sat on her bed together and we were joking about her weed stash”.</p><p>“Total stoner” Alice nodded in agreement.</p><p>Rio let out a short laugh and continued, “she wouldn’t tell me where it was so I went to get up and I told her I was going to find it myself” she explained, “but when I went to reach for her bedside table she grabbed me and I slipped and sort of landed on her” she finished gingerly.</p><p>“And then as I was going to get up she suddenly leaned up and…well…kissed me.”</p><p>Rio was met with silence, Alice simply staring back at her so she kept going.</p><p>“I didn’t do anything at first” she paused “but her lips were so soft and she looked so pretty with her hair all wild around her and she smelled so good… so I kissed her back. Hard.”</p><p>“Hard?” Alice questioned.</p><p>Rio nodded, “I pushed her back down and kissed her like…well like I’ve been wanting to for months now” she admitted.</p><p>“How did she react?” Alice asked dumbfounded, choosing to ignore the admission.</p><p>“Like she liked it, I swear to god Alice like she wanted me to keep kissing her”, Rio paused “I’m pretty sure I even heard her moan”.</p><p>“Pretty sure?” Alice asked skeptically.</p><p>“I guess it could have also been a groan cause I was kind of laying on top of her” Rio admitted sheepishly.</p><p>“Rioooo” Alice complained, “a moan and a groan are so different.”</p><p>“I know, I know!” Rio exclaimed, “that’s why I stopped as soon as I heard it”.</p><p>“Did she seem disappointed, when you stopped?”</p><p>“She didn’t seem anything Alice, that’s the problem” Rio groaned in frustration, her head dropping into her hands.</p><p>“She just laid there staring at the ceiling” Rio explained, “she barely said two words to me before I left”</p><p>Alice hummed in consideration.</p><p>“I’m worried I fucked up… she’s straight, she has a boyfriend, her mom thinks gay people shouldn’t have rights for gods sake.” Rio said with a look of anguish on her face. “Please say something”</p><p>“Honestly” Alice paused, “Jury is still out”</p><p>“That doesn’t help me” Rio whined, “worst of all I told her I would go to this stupid Halloween party this weekend”</p><p>“but you do love Halloween” Alice supplied.</p><p>“I love it a lot less when it's being celebrated at the house of the guy whose girlfriend I just tried to make out with.”</p><p>“Sounds like you did more than just try” Alice muttered, earning her a slap on the arm from Rio.</p><p>“Look, I’m going to be there and so is Jen, it’ll be fun”</p><p>“Great, can’t wait to third wheel, literally so fun!” Rio said, voice dripping with sarcasm.</p><p>“Yelena, is coming with us too so you won’t be a third wheel.” Alice had a sly smile on her face, “in fact, I know that Yelena has been asking about you, this could actually be perfect”</p><p>“Asking about me…how?” Rio asked suspiciously</p><p>“Ya know like what you’ve been up to, if you’re single, if you’re into blondes” Alice finished with an innocent shrug, her eyes anything but.</p><p>Rio pursed her lips. Yelena was undeniably hot and she could really use a distraction to get her mind off of Agatha.</p><p>“Fine, I’ll go… but only because I love Halloween” she conceded.</p><p>The next night Rio was adding the finishing touches to her grim reaper costume. She was wearing a green corset top cropped just above the ribs that connected to her green slitted skirt with a vine-like rope twisting down the middle of her ribcage. She finished the look with a black cloak and a shiny silver scythe that she attached to the garter belt hugging her exposed thigh.</p><p>She looked at herself in the mirror applying the last of her smokey eye makeup, a slow smile spreading across her face. She knew she looked good. She wondered what costume Agatha had decided on, couldn’t help but imagine the beautiful contrast they would create, Rio's death and darkness against Agatha’s soft and golden Aphrodite.</p><p>She shook her head to rid herself of the thought. She seriously needed to get a grip or she was going to melt into a puddle of want when she saw Agatha tonight.</p><p>“Are you almost ready?” she heard Alice call from their kitchen.</p><p>Rio emerged from her room, cloak flowing behind her. She came into the kitchen surprised to see Alice on her own in her 80’s rock star costume.</p><p>“We’re meeting Jen and Yelena there” she explained.</p><p>Rio simply nodded, accepting the shot glass Alice slid across the counter towards her. The vodka stung as it slid down Rio's throat, her eyes watering at the sensation.</p><p>“God, that's disgusting, give me 5 more of them” she joked.</p><p>Alice laughed, pouring her another one. They clinked their glasses together before downing the next shot.</p><p>“Alright let's get out of here, Jen texted me they are leaving in 5.”</p><p>Ralph and Vision’s apartment was nothing short of a frat house. Ugly leather couches and mismatched chairs littering the living room, 3 kegs of beer in the kitchen and a sad stack of empty pizza boxes sitting by the back door. The only decor seemed to be the empty bottles on the top of the kitchen cabinets and a couple of random tapestries hanging from the walls.</p><p>Rio wrinkled her nose as she took in the apartment through the crowd of costumed bodies. This place could not be more different from the light airiness that had surrounded her in Agatha’s room. I guess opposites really do attract, she thought to herself.</p><p>Alice caught sight of Jen in the kitchen pulling her in that direction.</p><p>Yelena turned to look towards them as Jen whispered something in her ear. Yelena’s eyes dragged slowly down Rio’s body in appreciation, making their way back up to meet her eyes with a smirk on her face.</p><p>She was wearing a skin tight navy blue shirt with a deep v cut that Rio’s eyes tried their hardest not to linger on. The matching booty shorts had a pair of handcuffs attached to them at the belt. The hat she was wearing said “Police” in large white block letters.</p><p>Without thinking Rio’s tongue darted out to lick her lips, Yelena’s green eyes tracking the movement.</p><p>Best way to get over someone was to get under someone new or whatever the saying was, Rio thought to herself.</p><p>She decided she was going to take her fuck the police mentality a little more literally tonight.</p>

<p>She was leaning over her desk trying to focus on doing her makeup but her eyes kept flicking to the reflection of her bed in the mirror behind her.</p><p>Her skin felt hot to the touch, a flush creeping up her throat at the thought of Rio pushing her down into the bed, her lips parting gently, her tongue sweeping against Agatha’s bottom lip. The smell of cedar and vanilla enveloping her completely.</p><p>She could’ve sworn her bed smelled like Rio for days afterwards, but maybe it was just wishful thinking.</p><p>She was yanked from her thoughts by the sound of a loud crash coming from the kitchen. She put down her eyeliner with a deep sigh, getting up to see what mess her boyfriend could have possibly made in the 5 minutes since she’d seen him last.</p><p>They had been sitting on Agatha’s bed, Ralph watching YouTube videos on his phone at an obnoxious volume while Agatha tried to focus on her book.</p><p>When Ralph had put down the phone in favour of kissing up Agatha’s thighs she had humoured him. Let him kiss up to her stomach, lips eventually finding her shirt covered nipples. She felt him pressing into her, grunting in an effort to hold himself up while he continued to grind down into Agatha through his jeans. His movements were stilted, no real rhythm and Agatha wondered briefly if he was going to come in his pants. Wouldn’t be the first time she thought to herself, holding back an eye roll.</p><p>She wasn’t in the mood to pretend, “I’m on my period” she lied.</p><p>Ralph stopped, a pout on his face as he lifted his head to look Agatha in the eyes.</p><p>“How about a blowie?” he asked hopefully.</p><p>Agatha simply scowled in response.</p><p>“Fine whatever, I’m going to get something to eat” Ralph explained, pushing himself off of her and heading towards the kitchen.</p><p>Agatha walked into the kitchen to see her NWU mug smashed on the floor, “you really should have a better system” Ralph shrugged as he picked up the pieces, gesturing to the mismatched mug cupboard that was very close to overflowing.</p><p>She couldn’t help it, she loved a cute mug. She hadn’t meant to start collecting them, it just kind of happened.</p><p>“I think Vision and I are going to pre together.” Ralph explained, tossing the broken mug into the trash without a second thought.</p><p>Agatha gritted her teeth, “so what? I’m just getting ready here by myself?” She asked “I thought the whole point of you coming over was so we could drive back to yours together.”</p><p>Ralph simply shrugged “I’ll give you money for an uber.”</p><p>He leaned forward to plant a hard kiss on Agatha’s lips, the stubble from his beard itching her cheeks.</p><p>“Fine” she mumbled, turning to make her way back to her room, decidedly not walking him out.</p><p>She could faintly hear the front door slamming behind Ralph as he left. God, could the man do nothing gently?</p><p>She sat on the edge of her bed, fingers tracing the embroidered flowers the same way Rio’s had earlier in the week.</p><p>Her mind drifted again to the weight of Rio’s body on hers, the lithe fingers that had gripped Agatha’s wrist as she pressed her down into the mattress. She felt a heat thrumming low in her stomach and clenched her legs together tightly to relieve some of the pressure. She shook her head sharply trying to rid herself of the memory. She stood up abruptly moving to her desk to finish her makeup.</p><p>By 7:30 she was dressed and ready to go, the white silky material of her Aphrodite costume clinging to her hips, gold accents dripping from her arms and her hair in soft waves flowing long down her back, a soft golden ribbon weaved through the loose braids on either side of her head to hold her hair back from her face.</p><p>She and Ralph had fought over their costumes for the night multiple times in the past week. He was adamant about doing a couples costume since he had found out Wanda and Vision were doing one.</p><p>Maybe she would have considered it if all of his costume ideas hadn’t been abysmal. Starting with Agatha as a 50s housewife and ending with her as the playboy bunny to Ralph’s Hugh Hefner. Yeah, no thanks.</p><p>she huffed as she opened the uber app, setting her destination to Ralph’s apartment. It wasn’t the first time he’d ditched her to do something with his roommates and it wouldn’t be the last.</p><p>She could hear the music from the party through the front door as she walked up the steps. Taking a deep breath she pushed it open making her way through the group of people crowding the front hall. She took a sharp left, swinging the door to Ralph’s room open and dropping her bag unceremoniously on the floor. The room was empty, a couple of empty monster cans on the desk and that same ugly plaid comforter on the bed.</p><p>She took a quick look in the mirror making sure the golden eyeliner she had used was staying in place before making her way out into the sea of bodies.</p><p>She spotted Ralph first, standing with Vision beside a keg, his hand reaching for the lower back of a blonde girl dressed as a cop who was coming to get a drink. The blonde turned to slap his hand away, grabbing two red cups of beer, keeping one for herself and passing one to the girl in a black cloak standing beside her.</p><p>Agatha did a double take as the girl beside the blonde turned to take her cup, her long tanned leg peeking through the slit of her skirt, there was a garter strapped to her thigh with a plastic silver scythe that glinted in the kitchen light. A sexy grim reaper Agatha thought to herself with a smirk.</p><p>As the women took the cup she turned to face Agatha fully, hazel eyes with lids painted smokey grey meeting Agatha’s icey blue gaze. Rio.</p><p>In the haze of the past few days she had completely forgotten she had invited Rio tonight.</p><p>Rio offered a nod in her direction, a small smile on her face before turning her attention back to the blonde.</p><p>The blonde who’s hand was now around Rio’s waist, thumb brushing in soft strokes up and down as they chatted with each other.</p><p>Agatha scoffed, who the hell was this girl. Had Rio really had the audacity to bring a random plus one to the party Agatha had invited her to. Unbelievable.</p><p>She watched as the two made their way to one of the worn out leather couches across the room. The blonde was practically sitting in Rio’s lap, her thighs tossed over Rio's legs on the couch as she played with Rio's long black hair.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, surely Rio wasn’t into this girl, desperate didn’t seem like her type.</p><p>She ignored the tight feeling in her chest and moved towards the kitchen to get herself a drink, she skipped the keg opting for one of the shots Vision was currently pouring.</p><p>Ralph had made a hasty exit when he saw her coming. If it had been any other day she might have reamed him out for flirting but she was currently distracted.</p><p>“You okay Aggie?” Vision asked, “you seem agitated”.</p><p>Agatha grumbled at the use of the nickname she despised. “Do you know who that is?” She asked, pointing to the blonde girl on Rio’s lap.</p><p>“Oh yeaaah, that’s Yelena. She’s Natasha’s little sister. She’s hot but I think she’s gay so you have nothing to worry about” clearly misreading who her growing frustration was directed at.</p><p>“Well yeah, Vis, I have eyes” she said gesturing to Yelena who seemed to be trying to meld herself to Rio. Every time Agatha looked back they were closer and closer to each other.</p><p>“I didn’t think blondes were your type” Vision joked, clearly misunderstanding what part of that sentence Agatha had agreed with him on.</p><p>“I meant clearly she’s gay Vis” she said, rolling her eyes.</p><p>Vision suddenly seemed to understand, eyes widening as he took in Yelena’s current position on top of Rio. He laughed nervously, pushing another shot in her direction before turning away and running off to join Ralph.</p><p>Agatha grimaced as the second shot burned its way down to her empty stomach. She grabbed a monster from the fridge to try to get rid of the taste. Only making her gag all over again, god how did Ralph drink so much of this shit.</p><p>She scanned the room for Wanda but her roommate was nowhere to be found. She tried her absolute hardest but couldn’t seem to stop herself from looking back in Rio’s direction.</p><p>This time when she looked towards her, the blonde was fully in her lap, one knee on either side of Rio’s hips with Rio’s slender fingers skimming the top of her incredibly short shorts.</p><p>Agatha froze, watching the blonde lean in to plant a messy kiss on Rio’s lips. When she looked like she was going to lean back Rio’s hand tightened on her hips, the other threading through her short blonde hair pulling her head back in to deepen the kiss.</p><p>Agatha wanted to look away. She wanted to turn around and pretend like she didn’t know how Rio’s lips felt. She wanted to stop feeling this way. She needed to stop feeling this way.</p><p>Without thinking she shifted forwards, her legs carrying her towards Rio and Yelena before her mind could catch up.</p><p>When she was a couple feet away from the couch her brain finally recalibrated and she tried to take a sharp left to stop herself from doing something so incredibly stupid.</p><p>Her foot caught on the edge of the frayed carpet as she tried to dodge the couch arm. Before she could catch herself she was stumbling forward, the energy drink in her hand flying forward and smacking into Rio’s chest, the sticky liquid sloshing out onto her corset top, dribbling down to her bare ribs.</p><p>Rio let out a small gasp, wide hazel eyes meeting Agatha’s. She felt like a deer in the headlights. She hadn’t been trying to interrupt Rio’s makeout session, really that hadn’t been her intention. Right?</p><p>If that was true why did it feel like a weight was lifted off her chest when the blonde sprung backwards to avoid the splash. Quickly removing herself from Rio’s lap and grabbing the can, thrusting it back towards Agatha.</p><p>“You should really watch where you’re going,” Yelena said, clearly annoyed at the interruption.</p><p>Agatha opted to ignore her completely, eyes still locked on Rio. She pulled her bottom lip between her teeth. “I’m so sorry Rio,” she extended her hand towards Rio “let me help you get cleaned up.” She said, pulling her up off the couch.</p><p>Yelena gave Rio a bewildered expression, “you good?” Was all she asked.</p><p>“Yeah… fine just give me a few minutes, I’ll be back for you” she tried to give a sly smile but it fell short.</p><p>Agatha bit down hard on her lip. Something about this whole situation was making her stomach turn. Maybe it was just the vodka shots on an empty stomach she thought to herself.</p><p>She brushed past Yelena without a word, moving hand in hand with Rio towards the bathroom.</p><p>Locked, dammit. She shifted on her feet rerouting them towards Ralph’s room, praying he was literally anywhere else right now.</p><p>She let out a sigh of relief as she pulled Rio into the empty room.</p><p>“Why are we in a boys' bedroom?” Rio said, wrinkling her nose.</p><p>Agatha bit back a laugh, “it’s Ralph’s room, I have some makeup wipes here we can use to uh… clean you up” she said gesturing towards Rio’s chest.</p><p>Rio just stared at her as Agatha dug through her bag in search of the wipes.</p><p>“So, who was the blonde?” Agatha asked, feigning nonchalance.</p><p>Rio narrowed her eyes, “Yelena, why?”</p><p>Agatha pulled a wipe from the package moving towards Rio and pressing the wipe to her chest, starting at her collarbone and making her way downwards</p><p>“No reason, just haven’t seen her before” she paused, hand drifting lower, wiping the sticky drink off the top of Rio’s sternum.</p><p>“You guys seemed friendly”</p><p>Rio’s breath stuttered for a moment, Agatha was almost positive she wouldn’t have felt it if her hand hadn’t been pressed to Rio’s chest.</p><p>“Are you… jealous?” She asked in disbelief</p><p>Agatha looked up, blue eyes stormy and unreadable “why would I be jealous?”</p><p>Without breaking eye contact, Agatha’s hand shifted from Rio’s sternum down to her ribs, continuing to clean her off.</p><p>“I don’t know Agatha, why would you invite me here and then spill a drink all over me?”</p><p>“It was an accident” Agatha whined defensively.</p><p>“Then you won’t mind if I go back out there to finish what I started” Rio smirked, wetting her lips with the tip of her tongue.</p><p>Agatha’s hand tightened possessively on Rio’s ribs, palms flexing to keep her in place.</p><p>“Don’t” she muttered, mirroring the same word she had said to Rio in her bedroom earlier this week before she kissed her.</p><p>Rio seemed to recognize it too, body going stock still under Agatha’s touch.</p><p>Agatha took a step forward into Rio’s space, hand still on her ribs, guiding her back against the closed door.</p><p>“Agatha…” Rio said, her tone held an unspoken warning.</p><p>“What?” she mumbled, eyes drifting down to Rio’s lips.</p><p>“We are at your boyfriend’s house” Rio paused, “in his bedroom” she finished gesturing around wildly.</p><p>That made Agatha pause, but she didn’t move away. She couldn’t. Not when Rio looked like that. Skin glowing in the dim light, the golden flecks in her eyes dancing as she squinted at Agatha trying desperately to understand what was going on.</p><p>“We can't,” Agatha breathed out, barely a whisper.</p><p>“I know” Rio nodded, stepping to the side to distance herself.</p><p>Agatha’s knee shot out, slotting between Rio’s legs to hold her in place. The thin material of her skirt pulling at the slit, exposing a toned thigh. Agatha could feel the heat of Rio's body through the layers, realizing her own thigh was just a couple inches short of Rio’s center.</p><p>She wasn’t sure if the soft moan had come from her or Rio, all she knew was that it ripped through the quiet room leaving a charged tension in its wake.</p><p>They stopped for a moment then, pupils blown wide. Ocean eyes locked on honeyed brown. This time Rio leaned in.</p><p>The kiss was tentative, surprisingly uncertain given their current position. All Agatha could do was respond in fervour. She slotted their lips together in a bruising kiss. Her brain felt fuzzy</p><p>She brushed her tongue along Rio’s lips, begging for entrance. Her only intent was to consume. And consume she did.</p><p>Her tongue met Rio’s in a soft brush at first. Then she was devouring her, tilting her head so she could deepen the kiss, so she could taste more of her. She couldn’t help the moan that escaped into Rio’s mouth.</p><p>She tasted divine, like mint julep and the coconut lip balm she must have applied before kissing her date. Agatha let a low growl escape her throat at the thought. Pushing Rio back against the door with enough force that she let out a small grunt.</p><p>Before she had a chance to recover, Agatha was on her again, this time moving her hair over her shoulder and kissing up the length of her neck. As she moved forward to press their chests flush together, the leg still planted between Rio’s thighs shifted up finally meeting her core.</p><p>Rio let out a throaty gasp at the sudden contact and Agatha did everything she could to stop her eyes from rolling back in her head at the sound and the feeling of Rio’s hot core pressed against her silk covered thigh.</p><p>Agatha’s hands shifted, finding Rio’s hips and encouraging her to grind down harder on her thigh. A strangled moan escaped Rio at the newfound pressure and she rolled her hips forward into Agatha, chasing the feeling.</p><p>Agatha felt like she was in a fever dream. Every part of her was on fire. She wasn’t sure she had ever felt like this before, she was ruining her underwear and she couldn’t care less.</p><p>She could feel Rio’s thighs trembling slightly and moved a hand down to the exposed leg, lifting it up and around her waist for support. The new angle gave Rio the stability she needed to roll her hips again, continuing to grind down onto Agatha tensed thigh.</p><p>“Oh fuckkkk” Rio’s head fell back against the door with a thump.</p><p>“Good?” Agatha asked in between open mouthed kisses, uncertainty seeping into her voice. She’d never done this before. She’d touched herself before, sure. But this wasn’t the same, in fact not even close. Not with Rio in her grip, writhing against her, making the most unholy noises she’d ever heard. She felt like her brain was melting.</p><p>“Mhmm so good” Rio whimpered into Agatha’s ear, her hands making a mess of Agatha’s curls as she searched for something to anchor herself with. Her fingers caught on the ribbon in Agatha’s braids tugging harshly as Agatha left a gentle bite on her collarbone.</p><p>A groan ripped through Agatha’s chest, the sweet sting of Rio’s hands wrapped in her hair, making her skull tingle. Goosebumps spread down the back of her neck.</p><p>Rio’s chest was flushed as Agatha ducked down further, licking the still sticky skin where she had spilled her drink. Glancing up to catch Rio’s eyes as she licked just above her breast.</p><p>“Thanks for cleaning me up.” Rio murmured.</p><p>Her voice was low, raspy in a way Agatha had never heard before. Agatha’s stomach clenched at the sound. She huffed out a laugh at the insinuation, her breath fanning across Rio’s chest. Her eyes widened as she felt Rio’s nipples harden against her in response.</p><p>“AGATHAAA” she heard before three loud raps on the door. The sound freezing her in place.</p><p>“Are you in there?” It was Ralph’s voice ringing through the door. The door handle jiggling as he tried to get into the room. His goddamn room.</p><p>Rio reacted quickly, pushing Agatha away from her and pulling her skirt back over her leg. Her eyes scanned Agatha up and down, assessing. She tucked the ribbon back into her braid and did her best to smooth down her hair.</p><p>Agatha's hands shook as she tried to help her, she felt like she was on the verge of a panic attack. The door handle jiggled again.</p><p>“Is this locked? Agatha are you in there?” Ralph called out.</p><p>“Coming” Agatha croaked, her voice cracking at the end.</p><p>She locked eyes with Rio who simply offered a nod, expression unreadable.</p><p>Agatha moved past her to open the door.</p><p>What the fuck was she going to do.</p>

<p>Ralph burst through the door the second Agatha turned the lock.</p><p>“Why the fuck is this door locked?” He demanded, eyes darting around the room.</p><p>His eyes locked on Rio, narrowing, “what the fuck is she doing in here?” Clearly addressing Agatha but his eyes never left Rio.</p><p>She wasn’t backing down, she just returned his glare as they both waited for Agatha to respond.</p><p>“She uh- I mean I spilled my drink on her” Agatha stuttered.</p><p>“And she needed to be locked in my room with you, why?” Ralph asked skeptically.</p><p>“I was just giving her a wipe” she said, quickly grabbing the makeup wipe package and waving it around as proof. “I didn’t want any of your creepy friends coming in here while she got cleaned up so I locked it.”</p><p>Agatha was clearly trying to sound apathetic but the slight waver in her voice was giving her away.</p><p>Ralph seemed to catch it and he paused to take Agatha in, his eyes leaving Rio for the first time since he had burst into the room.</p><p>“What happened to your dress?” He asked, voice laced with suspicion, eyes trailing down to her thighs.</p><p>Agatha’s hands flew to her dress, it seemed like she immediately found what Ralph was referring to, her breath catching slightly.</p><p>Rio could see it then, a small but visible wet patch on the thigh she had buried between Rio’s legs.</p><p>Rio could feel the heat rising in her cheeks. Thank god the room was dark enough to hide the fierce blush that was creeping down her neck.</p><p>Sure, kissing Agatha had felt fucking amazing. She had kissed Rio like she wanted to devour her. The feeling of Agatha’s body pressed against hers had been heavenly and she had become acutely aware of how wet she was getting with every new sound that slipped from Agatha’s kiss swollen lips. What she hadn’t realized is that she had literally soaked through her underwear.</p><p>Now with the lack of body heat and the visible evidence she could clearly feel the underwear clinging to her, completely ruined. God, Agatha hadn’t even touched her, not really. She should feel embarrassed but she was having a hard time thinking about anything other than Agatha’s lips, and her hair, and her body pressing Rio into the door.</p><p>She was snapped out of her reverie by the sound of Ralph repeating his question in a loud snarl, “well? What the fuck happened to your dress”.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers brushed over the wet spot on her dress, hesitating for a moment before she slowly brought her hand to her lips. The tip of her pink tongue sliding out to gently lick her pointer and middle finger.</p><p>It took everything in Rio to not audibly moan at the action. She clenched her teeth together in an effort to stop her jaw from coming completely unhinged.</p><p>“Hmm” she hummed, in what sounded alarmingly close to appreciation.</p><p>“Must have spilled some on myself too” she said innocently.</p><p>It was clear that Ralph didn’t believe her, but without any further evidence the couple seemed to be in a standoff.</p><p>Rio could feel her eye beginning to twitch at the tension, she had to get the fuck out of here. She was terrified that if she opened her mouth she was going to say something that she would regret.</p><p>As if she could sense Rio’s distress, Agatha turned back to her “I think you should go” her eyes pleading with Rio to leave quietly, no questions asked.</p><p>She didn’t take any time to consider it, just took her the out that was presented to her.</p><p>“My uber is almost here anyways” she nodded, muttering a goodbye as her legs carried her out the door as fast as they could without actually breaking into a sprint.</p><p>She didn’t stop to look for her friends, didn’t say bye to Yelena, she hardly even had her shoes laced before she was out the door.</p><p>She hadn’t called an uber and she didn’t plan to. She needed fresh air and maybe a fucking sedative.</p><p>Almost getting caught making out with Agatha, in her boyfriends house, in his fucking room no less. The whole situation had her heart pumping out of her chest. She felt like an animal being hunted.</p><p>She paused by a covered bus stop, sliding onto the bench and putting her head between her legs. She was trying to take deep breaths like her therapist had taught her, in through her nose for 1,2,3,4 hold out through her mouth for 1,2,3,4.</p><p>After a few minutes her breathing had returned to normal and the erratic rhythm of her heart slowed. She stood back up, deciding to walk the rest of the way home.</p><p>Once she got home she closed and locked her bedroom door, slowly stripping her costume off until she was standing naked apart from her sticky underwear.</p><p>She sat on the edge of her bed, mind still racing. She had kissed Agatha first this time but god had Agatha kissed her back.</p><p>A shiver ran down Rio’s spine, her fingers brushing softly over her collarbone where Agatha had planted soft open mouthed kisses. Her hand drifted down to her breast, kneading the skin softly, fingers drifting to tweak her nipple piercing causing a soft moan to escape her lips.</p><p>She wondered what it would have felt like if they had more time, if Agatha’s lips had trailed down to take a hardened nipple in her mouth. She imagined what it would feel like if her tongue had twirled around the piercing, soft blue eyes gazing up at Rio.</p><p>She allowed herself to lay back on the bed, hand continuing down her stomach until it was resting at the waistband of her black cotton underwear.</p><p>Her hand toyed with the waistband for a moment before it slipped underneath, fingers meeting neatly trimmed curls. She gasped as she felt the slick covering them. Her hand drifted down further, past her clit and towards her entrance. She met no resistance as she pushed two fingers inside of herself, hand moving easily through the abundant wetness. She bit down on her lip to keep herself quiet, she wasn’t sure Alice was even coming home tonight but didn’t want to risk it.</p><p>Her mind replayed the gentle pressure of Agatha’s thigh as it slipped between her legs, the hungry look in her eyes as she kissed down Rio’s chest, lapping up the sticky sweetness of the drink she had spilled on her because she was jealous, because she didn’t like seeing Rio with anyone else.</p><p>Rio curled her fingers inside of herself, holding back a moan at the thought of Agatha’s possessive grip on her hips as she pushed Rio back against the door. The way her tongue had slid inside of her mouth like she was claiming her with each kiss, mine, mine, mine. Rio let out a soft whimper as she brought the heel of her palm up to press against her throbbing clit. She could feel herself on the edge of an orgasm already, this had to be some kind of record.</p><p>She curled inside herself again, imagining it was Agatha’s fingers instead of her own. Agatha whispering in her ear, talking her through it, telling her no one else could have her. Agatha wringing the pleasure from every inch of her.</p><p>She came with a gasp, her back arching off the mattress. Soaking through her underwear all over again.</p><p>She stared up at the ceiling, trying to slow her breath. She moved to stand up slowly, legs still shaky from the force of her orgasm. She avoided her own gaze in the mirror as she washed her hands and got ready for bed.</p><p>She checked her phone more times than she would like to admit before putting it on do not disturb and going to bed. Agatha would text her when she was ready. She was sure of it.</p><p>- </p><p>It had been 2 weeks. 2 weeks without a call, a text, an appearance at any of their shared lectures.</p><p>Agatha had seemingly disappeared off the face of the earth. The only reason Rio knew she was still alive was because she was occasionally participating in the online discussion posts for their poly sci class.</p><p>After 3 separate text messages left on read, Rio had briefly considered emailing Agatha through their school portal just to see if she would respond. But she had decided that’s was entirely too desperate.</p><p>So what if Agatha didn’t want to see her, or talk to her, or even think about her for that matter. It’s not like Rio had given herself the best orgasm she’d had in months to the thought of her. No, no, cause that would be truly pathetic.</p><p>She didn’t miss Agatha, she was just worried about her. That was all.</p><p>As she was leaving her study group she caught sight of Wanda in a corner booth at the library, head down and immersed in whatever she was working on.</p><p>She startled slightly at Rio’s greeting “what’s up Wands” she said lightly.</p><p>Wanda smiled brightly, “hey Rio, just cramming for this chemistry exam.”</p><p>Rio nodded, sliding into the booth across from her. “So” she said feigning nonchalance, “have you seen Agatha lately?”</p><p>Wanda’s brow furrowed slightly, “not since she went to visit her mom.”</p><p>“Oh I didn’t know she was gone, when did she leave?” Rio asked innocently. No hidden agenda here.</p><p>“She left right after the Halloween party, like SO early the next morning” Wanda pouted, “I didn’t even get to say bye to her, I didn’t realize she was going to be away for the whole month”</p><p>“The whole month?” Rio tried to keep her voice neutral. “Any idea what she is up to?”</p><p>Wanda shrugged, “I know she’s been going to this church group a lot with her mom” she wrinkled her nose, “not really my scene but it's probably good for her mom’s campaign.”</p><p>Rio’s mind was moving a hundred miles a minute. It made sense. A straight daughter who went to church with her mom, good. A queer daughter who cheated on her boyfriend with a liberal lesbian, bad. Rio wasn’t unaware of the optics, but there is no way Agatha’s mom could have known about them? Right?</p><p>Trying to seem as uninvested as possible, Rio nodded, moving to leave the library booth, “thanks Wands, good luck on your exam.”</p><p>Wanda just smiled at her knowingly, returning her focus back to her laptop.</p><p>Once she was alone in her apartment again Rio decided, against her better judgement, to try calling Agatha.</p><p>The phone rang, once, twice, three times before, to her surprise, Agatha picked up.</p><p>There was silence on the line until she heard Agatha breathe out, “Rio” she said shakily.</p><p>“Agatha” she responded, “I just need to know you’re okay, please tell me you’re okay.”</p><p>There was another pause on the line, then Agatha’s voice cut through the silence, harsher this time “you need to stop reaching out.” A breath, “what happened was a mistake, you just- you confused me.”</p><p>Rio scoffed in disbelief, “I confused you? Agatha, you kissed me first.”</p><p>She was met with more silence.</p><p>She heard a door slam in the background and the sound of a woman calling Agatha’s name, the voice sounded like it was getting closer.</p><p>“Rio please just - just don’t call me again, don’t text me, just forget anything ever happened. Please.” She begged.</p><p>“Agatha, who are you talking to?” She heard a sharp voice demand on the other end of the phone.</p><p>“Oh just a spam call” she heard Agatha respond before the line went dead.</p>

<p>Ralph slammed the door the second Rio was gone, his fist clenched as he turned back towards Agatha.</p><p>She winced at the sound, rolling her shoulders back in an attempt to make herself look bigger and far braver than she actually felt.</p><p>Her and Ralph fought all the time, this was nothing new. The look in his eyes is what was really scaring her. It wasn’t just anger, it was pure unadulterated rage.</p><p>He took a menacing step towards her, fists still clenched at his side. Agatha put her hands up in front of herself, blocking him from stepping any closer.</p><p>“Ralph let’s just talk” her voice pleading.</p><p>He blinked once, his lips curling up into a cruel smile “what is there to talk about? You’re a fucking dyke.” He said matter of factually.</p><p>Agatha was aware she should say something, this would be the time to open her usually loud mouth and defend herself. Call him crazy. Gaslight if she needed to because there wasn’t a place in her world for that version of her. The version that kissed her friends behind closed doors. The version that wanted them to be more than friends.</p><p>It didn’t matter if Rio made her head buzz and her stomach clench. It didn’t matter if she held her with such reverence it could only rival things Agatha had claimed to feel when she went to church.</p><p>None of it meant anything because in the end what Agatha wanted didn’t matter.</p><p>“So you’re not even going to deny it?” He asked incredulously.</p><p>At her responding silence he let out a harsh laugh, “I fucking knew it. I can’t wait to hear what your mom has to say about all of this.”</p><p>He pulled his phone from his back pocket, unlocking the screen swiftly. He pulled up Evanora’s contact in his phone, holding it up to Agatha’s face. She tried not to flinch as her mothers photo stared back at her.</p><p>“Ralph you… you don’t know what you’re saying, you- you don’t know what you’re doing.”</p><p>He shook his head ignoring Agatha, “should I put it on speakerphone? I’m sure the disappointment will be loud and clear either way” he shrugged, moving to press down on the call button.</p><p>Agatha’s hand darted out to grab his wrist, stopping him. “You’re making a mistake.”</p><p>she was praying he couldn’t feel the way her fingers were trembling around his wrist.</p><p>“The mistake was thinking I could turn you into someone loveable, someone that people wanted around.” He paused, “but I couldn’t even fuck the dyke out of you”.</p><p>Her eyes were brimming with tears now, it was nothing she hadn’t heard before. Everybody agreed that she was a mistake. So unloveable even her own mother couldn’t bear to have her around.</p><p>She wrapped her arms around herself, trying to physically hold herself together.</p><p>“Please Ralph, don’t do this, I’ll do anything” she begged. She wondered briefly if this is what rock bottom felt like.</p><p>He lowered his phone slowly, his eyes locked on Agatha, “Anything huh?” He said, the same cruel smile painting his face.</p><p>Agatha held her breath. She didn’t know where this was headed but she was certain she wasn’t going to like it.</p><p>“Why don’t you call Vidal to come back here so she can have fun with both of us. You want me to keep your secret? Then I need one of my own.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach churned, bile rising in her throat at the request. She wasn’t letting Rio get anymore tangled up in her mess than she already was. There was absolutely no way that was happening.</p><p>The grimace on Agatha’s face must have given her away.</p><p>“Fine then, time to call mommy dearest” he said, hitting the dial button with a scowl.</p><p>The phone only rang once before Evanora picked up, her voice light and cordial on the other end. The way it was when she spoke to pretty much anyone other than her daughter.</p><p>“Ralph, what a pleasant surprise” she practically chirped.</p><p>Ralph went to open his mouth and instinct took over, Agatha lunged forward reaching for the phone, trying desperately to knock it free from his hand.</p><p>He was quick, too quick. He dodged Agatha, pushing her onto the ground face down and straddling her hips with his knees pressing into her triceps to keep her pinned down.</p><p>She struggled underneath him but it was useless. He was dead weight on top of her.</p><p>“Ralph?” She heard her mother ask on the other end of the line.</p><p>Ralph adjusted himself on top her her, “Hi Mrs. Harkness, how are you?” his voice dripping with mock sweetness.</p><p>If Agatha was in any other situation she might have rolled her eyes, maybe even faked a gag at the performance the two of them were putting on.</p><p>“I’m well, and how are you? How is Agatha? Behaving herself I hope?”</p><p>“That’s actually why I called…” he trailed off slow and deliberate. He actually had the gall to sound hesitant.</p><p>“You see Mrs. Harkness,” he continued, “I found Agatha in a…compromising position with one of her friends.”</p><p>Her mothers voice was muffled on the other end but Agatha already knew what she was asking.</p><p>“Yes, it was.” he nodded. “I’m worried about her Mrs. Harkness. Spending time around this woman, it’s” he paused surely for dramatic effect, “it’s confusing her… making her want to act…immorally.”</p><p>Agatha growled beneath him, flailing again, desperately trying to free herself.</p><p>“I understand,” Ralph said solemnly, coming to some sort of agreement with Evanora. “I think that’s for the best as well.”</p><p>He rolled off Agatha and stood hurriedly as he hung up the phone.</p><p>Agatha rolled over quickly. She tried to push herself up to stand in front of him again but she faltered, arms aching from where his knees had been pressed against her.  Her lungs burned as she gasped for air. Her heart slamming against her chest.</p><p>“What the fuck did you just do Ralph?” she demanded, barely a whisper.</p><p>Ralph simply shrugged, a smug look on his face. “Your mom and I just agreed that you could use a break. An escape from the temptation.” he paused, “and Agatha? If you breathe a word of this to anyone, I will make sure every last soul on this campus knows what a disgusting little dyke you are.”</p><p>He turned to grab Agatha’s bag, tossing it in her direction.</p><p>“She’ll be over in the morning to pick you up, better get packing” he said coldly.</p><p>Agatha stood, frozen in place. she wanted to scream, and cry, and punch a hole through the wall like a fucking frat boy.</p><p>Her mother was coming here. To her safe space. To the home she had made for herself.</p><p>She had managed to keep her away for 2 years. She got good grades, she volunteered, she spent her free time with a “good” catholic boy. Hell, she had even dropped out of the fine arts minor her mother had deemed frivolous. She had done everything she could to make sure her mother had no reason to get involved in her life.</p><p>But now she was coming here and she was going to take it all away. The worst part was Agatha couldn’t do anything to stop her.</p><p>-</p><p>Evanora stormed through the door to her apartment at 7am sharp. The sun had just started to pour through her window and her head was already pounding.</p><p>She hadn’t slept, just packed her bags and sat on her bed. Stoic, waiting. When the tears came she let them. They poured down her face, a steady stream that there was no point in wiping away. She didn’t have the energy for it.</p><p>She had briefly considered running, but where would she really go? Her mother had connections everywhere, she would find her eventually.</p><p>Evanora tore through her room like a tornado, looking for something, evidence maybe?</p><p>Good thing Agatha wasn’t a fucking idiot. She had tossed her vibrator, flushed her weed, discarded basically anything that would suggest she had a personality outside of being a student and devout catholic.</p><p>Her mother seemed frustrated when she came up empty handed, no incriminating evidence, no rainbow flag hanging on Agatha’s wall.</p><p>“Mother” Agatha started nervously, “I don’t know what Ralph told you but-”</p><p>“He told me what I needed to know” she cut her off, pure vitriol in her voice, “what I’ve always known.”</p><p>Her mother moved towards her, reaching out to cup her face. To anyone else it may have looked gentle, loving even, but Agatha knew better. It was about power. Getting the upper hand and keeping it.</p><p>“You have always been this way Agatha. Even as a child. I think you were born evil.” she spat, no remorse in her voice.</p><p>Agatha’s lip quivered, her mothers nails digging into her jaw.</p><p>“You are deviant Agatha, but you don’t have to stay that way. I will help you repent”. Her mother said with finality.</p><p>And suddenly Agatha was 10 years old again, in the confessional receiving her penance. Kneeling at the altar for hours. Praying for forgiveness until her knees were bruised black and blue.</p><p>“Father Michael is expecting us” her mother said, ushering her to stand up from the bed.</p><p>Agatha walked past Wanda’s room, the door cracked slightly. She could see her still deep in sleep, arm hanging lazily off the edge of the bed. What she wouldn’t give to be a normal college student. For the worst thing she was going to experience today to be a hangover.</p><p>-</p><p>2 weeks, it had been 2 full weeks of prayer and confession and rosary group and bible study. The penance for homosexual tendencies was, as it turns out, far worse than anything she had experienced as a child.</p><p>She was sure she hadn’t slept more than 3 hours in one night, every morning torn from her bed, forced to her knees. Repent, repeat.</p><p>Her mother had taken her wallet, her passport, her phone, her laptop. She was only allowed access to her things under supervision. A watchful eye to keep her from falling back into tempation.</p><p>When the screen lit up with Rio’s name for the 3rd time that week she sighed loudly. After Rio’s first text she had changed her contact name to “NWU plumbing” in an attempt to avoid suspicion.</p><p>Her mother glared at the phone, slapping the side button to silence the call. “You really need to block these numbers Agatha” her mother nagged.</p><p>“I know mother, I’m sorry” she muttered, more out of habit than anything else.</p><p>Suddenly the doorbell rang, Agatha breathed a sigh of relief, a brief reprieve from the time she was forced to spend with her mother watching over her shoulder while she submitted her weekly discussion posts.</p><p>She hadn’t outright called Agatha an idiot yet, but if the way she clicked her tongue at every response that Agatha crafted was any indicator she clearly thought it.</p><p>Evanora returned a few minutes later, an unreadable look on her face. “My presence is required at the city council meeting.”</p><p>Her mothers gaze flickered across the table, silently deciding Agatha’s fate.</p><p>“Finish your work and once you are done go straight to your room.” She demanded.</p><p>Agatha nodded compliantly, “yes mother.”</p><p>Without another word Evanora was gone, the hard slam of the door against its wooden frame shaking the front of the house.</p><p>Agatha slowly set her head down on the table. She was finally alone. A shaky breath escaped her lips.</p><p>Her phone buzzed again. This time a text message from NWU plumbing.</p><p>“Please pick up.”</p><p>Agatha figured that by now Rio was aware that she was trapped with her mother, she had to give her props on the plausible deniability of the messages she had sent so far. They all actually sounded like they could have been from an overly concerned plumber.</p><p>Just as Agatha was about to respond the phone started to ring again. Agatha held it in her hand hesitantly. She let it ring for a few seconds before she finally answered the call.</p><p>Just like the first time Rio had called she didn’t say anything at first, just let the silence fill the line.</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio asked quietly.</p><p>“Rio” Agatha said with a sigh.</p><p>“I thought I told you to leave me alone.”</p><p>“I- I was worried about you” Rio stuttered.</p><p>Agatha let a harsh laugh slip, no one worried about her. Not really.</p><p>As a student she was an overachiever, a know it all. As a friend she was cold and avoidant and GOD knows she was a disappointing and deviant daughter.</p><p>It didn’t make sense for someone like Rio to worry about her. Someone good. Someone with pure intentions and a kind heart.</p><p>“Don’t waste your time.”</p><p>“You never answered my question.”</p><p>Agatha could practically hear Rio’s pout through the phone.</p><p>“You don’t want the answer Rio, trust me.”</p><p>“Please Agatha, I just need to know if you’re okay.” She pleaded, “I’m sorry if I screwed things up for you.”</p><p>Agatha paused at that, none of this was Rio’s fault. No matter how hard she tried to pretend it was. Suddenly she desperately needed Rio to know that.</p><p>“Rio,” she started softly, her voice as reassuring as she could make it. “This is on me, all of it. You have nothing to apologize for.”</p><p>“Then why does it feel like I fucked this whole thing up?” Rio asked, voice cracking. “I just don’t understand what happened. Did your mom find out? Did you tell her? Did you go home to get away from me?”</p><p>Rio paused to breathe, clearly about to continue her unending stream of questions before Agatha cut her off.</p><p>“I wasn’t trying to get away from you. I may be a bit of a masochist but I would never willingly tell my mother anything about my sex life.”</p><p>Rio made a choked noise on the other end of the line and Agatha realized her mistake. The insinuation that Rio was a part of her sex life. The thought made Agatha flush, heat creeping up her chest.</p><p>“Um- not that- I didn’t mean that we were- I just meant I didn’t tell her. Ralph took care of that one for me.” She rolled her eyes as though Rio could see her through the phone.</p><p>“That son of a bitch” Rio growled. “I’m going to kill him.” She said with finality.</p><p>“Rio, we both know that’s not going to help. If anything it’ll just get you expelled.”</p><p>Ralph’s dad was the dean of their faculty. A power hungry, demeaning and misogynistic excuse for a man. Like father like son I guess.</p><p>Rio grunted angrily but didn’t fight back, she knew Agatha was right.</p><p>Agatha’s voice softened, “I’m okay. I mean I’m stuck in a house alone with my mother and haven’t seen the outside world in days but I’m okay.”</p><p>“Are they…” Rio hesitated. “Are they punishing you?”</p><p>“Define punishing” Agatha said sarcastically but Rio wasn’t laughing.</p><p>She was jumping off the deep end. Risking, god, eternal damnation? If she believed anything she had heard over the past couple of weeks she was in for an extended vacation in hell. She shook her head trying to rid herself of the thought. The more time she spent here the harder it was to tell what she believed was true and what was a tactic used to put the fear of god back into her so called deviant soul.</p><p>“I mean it Agatha, what are they doing to you? What are they telling you?”</p><p>She took a deep breath. No use in denying it.</p><p>“They aren’t saying I can’t feel it, in so many words…” Agatha pauses, breath slowing “just that I can’t act on it. That’s the sin. Touching you.”</p><p>Rio didn’t respond at first. The silence stretched out between them.</p><p>“I can want to.” She said shyly.</p><p>It was time to be brave, “I do want to.”</p><p>She heard Rio’s sharp intake of breath through the phone.</p><p>“Do you…do you want that Rio?”</p><p>“More than anything” she exhaled.</p><p>“How- how do you want that? Can you..” she trailed off nervously, building up the courage to ask.</p><p>“Can you tell me how you want me to touch you?”</p><p>Rio let out a shake breath on the other end of the line.</p><p>“I- I can do that” Rio stuttered, clearly taking a moment to compose herself. “Where are you right now?”</p><p>“In the kitchen” Agatha murmured, eyes darting around.</p><p>“Go to your bedroom. Now.”</p>

<p>Okay. This was really happening. She needed to stay calm.</p><p>Rio briefly considered muting herself to scream in her pillow just to let some of her nervous energy out.</p><p>Agatha was on the other end of the phone, telling her she couldn’t have her. But she wanted to.</p><p>If the orgasm she’d given herself a few weeks ago to the simple thought of Agatha was any indicator, this was going to be embarrassingly quick.</p><p>She steeled herself. Laying back in her bed while she waited for Agatha to settle.</p><p>When the rustling on the other end of the phone stopped, she heard Agatha’s voice, more quiet now, “Okay, I’m in my room.”</p><p>Rio needed to take control of the situation, like now. Otherwise she was going to self implode. She took a steadying breath before moving the phone closer to her lips.</p><p>“Good girl,” she murmured.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched on the other end of the line. She liked praise, Rio could work with that.</p><p>Before she could second guess herself she hit the top button on the call to switch it from a regular phone call to a FaceTime.</p><p>She held her breath as she waited for Agatha to pickup the call.</p><p>Finally the FaceTime went through, Agatha‘s face popping up on the screen.</p><p>Rio took a second to take her in, she was sitting in a bed covered in plain white sheets with a wooden cross hung directly above her head. She was wearing a frock blouse with a neckline that ended just above her collarbones and a long beige skirt. She didn’t look like the Agatha she had grown to know. She looked tired in a way that suggested it was from more than a few hours of missed sleep.</p><p>As if she could read Rio’s mind she looked down, pushing a lock of hair behind her ear. She seemed almost embarrassed.</p><p>“I- I wasn’t expecting a FaceTime.” She looked up, eyes finally meeting Rio. A faint tinge of pink in her cheeks.</p><p>“I hope it’s okay, I just wanted to see you.” Rio said truthfully.</p><p>She smiled softly at that, “well I hope you’ve got a good imagination because this outfit really leaves a lot to be desired” she said jokingly.</p><p>She could feel Agatha trying to deflect, keep herself from letting whatever she was feeling shine through on her face now that Rio could see her.</p><p>She shook her head gently, “you look good Agatha, different, but still good.”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip, looking away like she wasn’t sure what came next. Agatha was a lot of things but usually shy wasn’t one of them.</p><p>Rio took a deep breath, “I also wanted to-“ she paused suddenly uncertain. Was this too much? All they had done was kiss and it had sent Agatha’s life into a spiral.</p><p>Agatha was watching her attentively, clearly trying to understand the inner turmoil. “Wanted to what Rio?”</p><p>“I wanted to show you what I like-” another deep breath, “- to show you how I want you to touch me.”</p><p>Agatha’s bottom lip was caught between her teeth, she simply nodded in response, eyes blazing into Rio’s.</p><p>Rio set her phone against her bedside table, her full body coming into view.</p><p>She was braless, wearing a cropped band tee and loose black cargo pants, she hadn’t exactly been expecting Agatha to actually answer the phone. She had been faced with radio silence from the other girl for the past couple of weeks.</p><p>She turned on her side flicking her long black hair over her shoulder, she grabbed the hem of her shirt ready to pull it over her head but she hesitated.</p><p>“Can I take this off?” She asked nervously. She wasn’t sure what Agatha’s boundaries were here.</p><p>Their kisses had been heavy handed but they’d never seen each other like this. Bare. Exposed. The thought of it was enough to send a shiver up Rio’s spine.</p><p>“Please” Agatha said softly.</p><p>And that was all it took. Rio was peeling the shirt off her chest, nipples stiffening at the chill in the air. Before she could look back up she heard Agatha’s breath hitch.</p><p>“You- you have- your nipples are…pierced” Agatha stammered, a flush rising above the collar of her shirt and up her neck.</p><p>Agatha looked utterly flustered and Rio couldn’t help but smirk.</p><p>“I do. It makes them extra sensitive.” As if to illustrate her point she moved a hand down to lightly flick the piercing, biting back a groan as her nipple hardened, straining around the barbell.</p><p>She moved her hand across her chest doing the same on the other side. When she looked back up Agatha’s pupils were blown wide, deep black swallowing the ocean blue of her irises.</p><p>Agatha made no move to remove her own shirt, just stared intently at Rio waiting for her to continue.</p><p>Taking a deep breath she kept going. “I like to be kissed here” she pointed to the soft skin behind her ear, “and here” she said fingers lightly trailing down the column of her throat towards her collarbone.</p><p>She brought her index and middle finger to her lips, wetting the tips of them with her tongue before bringing them back down to swirl across her still hardened nipples, ”and especially here.” She sighed softly, picturing Agatha’s mouth on her chest. Her hot tongue swirling around the hardened buds, her teeth nipping gently at the barbells.</p><p>Rio could see the flush of pink skin spreading up past the collar of Agatha’s shirt along the sides of her neck. She was blushing fiercely now. “Where else?” She asked in a rasp. “Where else would you like me to kiss you?”</p><p>Okay, they were doing this. Rio gave an almost imperceptible nod before her fingers continued their journey downwards, across her stomach and the small line of soft black hair leading to the waistband of her boxers sticking out above her jeans.</p><p>She heard a small gasp through the phone as her fingers dipped below the waistband, moving slowly through the wet curls.</p><p>“P-please, take them off” Agatha begged softly, “I want to see you.”</p><p>And who was Rio to deny her. She wanted nothing more than to show Agatha how much she needed her.</p><p>She flicked the button on her jeans, pulling the fly down in a swift motion. She shimmied out of them leaving her in just her boxers, a small wet stain visible where she was already dripping through them.</p><p>She should be embarrassed really, it’s not like Agatha had even touched her. But god she couldn’t help it, just her voice was enough to send Rio reeling.</p><p>“Better?” Rio asked, not sure she was willing to strip completely with Agatha fully dressed on the other side of the phone.</p><p>Agatha simply hummed, eyes glimmering as she took her in.</p><p>Rio’s hand moved again, coming to meet her mouth. She let her tongue dart out, wetting the tips of her fingers before she moved them down her chest and back into her boxers.</p><p>She moved through her slick folds, the sound of her wetness deafening in the silence.</p><p>“I like to be teased a little first” she explained, hand coming back up to rub her clit. She was so wet there was hardly any friction.</p><p>She continued the motion feeling her stomach coil, wetness dripping down her thighs.</p><p>“But then I would like to feel you inside of me” she rasped, fingers dipping down to her entrance as she gently pushed two inside of herself. She clenched around them and laid back further on the bed, spreading her legs apart to adjust.</p><p>Agatha let out an audible whine and when Rio’s eyes flashed up to meet hers she was flushed, her legs pulled together tightly and the skirt riding up her thighs as she sat back watching Rio.</p><p>Agatha had been surprisingly quiet so Rio decided to test it, “would you like that Agatha?” She proded, “to fill me up?”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip so hard her teeth left an indent when she finally let it go, “I want that Rio, so bad.” She paused, her face suddenly vulnerable, “I want you so bad.”</p><p>Rio nodded at her words, speeding up her pace as she fucked into herself picturing Agatha’s fingers instead.</p><p>“Keep talking Rio” Agatha's voice broke through like a reverie. “Tell me what you want, baby.”</p><p>Rio moaned at the pet name, curling her fingers inside herself at the same time sending shivers down her spine.</p><p>“I want you to fill me up Agatha, want to feel you inside of me curling your fingers, want you tongue  on my clit, want to come in your mouth-” Rio babbled.</p><p>“God, yes Rio I want that, please let me have that.”</p><p>Agatha’s skirt had drifted further up, her hand now settled at the apex of her thighs drawing smooth circles over the cotton fabric of her underwear.</p><p>Rio’s brain nearly short circuited at the sight. Her mind on a loop, the voice in her head chanting more, more, more.</p><p>“Let me see how badly you want it Agatha, please let me see you.” She begged. So much for playing it cool.</p><p>Agatha nodded shyly, shifting to pull her underwear down around her ankles. She settled back spreading her thighs again, opening herself up to Rio.</p><p>She was almost completely clothed but somehow fully exposed at the same time. Knowing Agatha trusted her with this sent a warm tingle through her chest. The warmth quickly grew into a burning heat as Agatha’s hands slipped back over her slick cunt, collecting the wetness dripping from her entrance and using it to rub languid circles across her clit.</p><p>Rio was entranced. She wasn’t trying to stare but she couldn’t help herself. “So pretty…” she murmured to herself.</p><p>It had clearly been loud enough that Agatha could hear her, she stopped her circles for a moment, glancing at Rio as if she was unsure of what to do next. Like she didn’t know how to handle being perceived like this.</p><p>“Is this how you touch yourself when you’re alone?”</p><p>Agatha whimpered in response.</p><p>“Do you think of me, Agatha?” Rio asked gently, “when you’re touching yourself?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, fingers picking up their pace, moving in tight circles across her clit.</p><p>Her lip was caught between her teeth to stop the moans from escaping her mouth. God what Rio wouldn’t do to be there with her right now.</p><p>“Are you still home alone?”</p><p>Agatha nodded again, brow furrowing slightly.</p><p>“I want to hear you.” Rio stated simply, “I want to know what you sound like when you come.”</p><p>“Oh.” Agatha seemed to mull it over for a second before she smiled gently, “Okay.”</p><p>Her fingers dipped down to her entrance again, collecting the wetness there. Her fingers teased at her entrance and Rio gulped audibly.</p><p>She was pretty sure that if Agatha started fucking herself she was going to go feral.</p><p>One of Agatha’s neatly manicured fingers slipped inside of herself, a soft moan escaping her lips at the feeling.</p><p>Fuck. Feral it is.</p><p>She started slowly pumping her finger in and out, the second quickly joining to stretch her out.</p><p>“Oh m-my god, fuck” she gasped as she started fucking herself roughly while Rio watched, eyes flicking between Agatha’s eyes and the apex of her thighs.</p><p>It was like she couldn’t decide what she wanted to see more, Agatha’s dripping cunt or the way her face scrunched up, mouth falling open in a choked out moan as she fucked herself for Rio.</p><p>“A-am close” Agatha stuttered out. “Want you to come with me” she gasped.</p><p>Rio’s eyes almost rolled back in her head, she still had her hands in her boxers but had been so fixated on Agatha she had stopped moving completely.</p><p>She was suddenly painfully aware of how wet she was, the white briefs almost see through now.</p><p>It wouldn’t take long to catch up, she was already halfway there. So wound up she could feel her clit throbbing as she watched Agatha continue to fuck herself.</p><p>With each stroke she brought the heel of her palm down to grind on her clit.</p><p>Rio fingers moved up to draw tight circles on her clit, eyes never leaving Agatha. She could see the other girls thighs shaking, she was so so close.</p><p>“Please Rio, fuck, I’m going to come”</p><p>Rio picked up her pace, feeling her stomach coil tightly, pressure building low and fast, heat blazing through her chest.</p><p>“Fuck Agatha I’m going to come too.”</p><p>Agatha groaned loudly.</p><p>“Come with me baby.”</p><p>And as if on command Agatha’s thighs snapped shut around her hand, back arching off the bed as the orgasm tore through her. A sinful moan ringing through the phone.</p><p>Rio felt the pressure inside of her snap, orgasm spreading through her until she could feel it in the very tips of her toes.</p><p>She struggled to keep her eyes open as she fucked herself through it, she didn’t want to miss a single moment of Agatha’s pleasure.</p><p>Agatha’s hand slowed between her legs, thighs still trembling with the aftershocks of her orgasm.</p><p>She had a dopey grin on her face when she looked back at Rio, eyes spacey and wide.</p><p>“Holy fuck” she said.</p><p>Before Rio could respond she heard a loud bang on the other end of the phone.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes quickly shifted, filling with panic.</p><p>“Holy fuck” she said again, but this time instead of awe her voice was filled with fear.</p><p>She jumped off her bed quickly grabbing the phone.</p><p>“I’m sorry Rio I have to go” she whispered, ending the call abruptly.</p><p>Rio sat back, hand still in her boxers. The post orgasm bliss fighting against the growing dread she felt.</p><p>She needed to do something.</p><p>She needed to get Agatha the fuck out of that house.</p>

<p>The sound of her mother’s feet pounding up the stairs sprung her into action, tossing her skirt back over her legs, hands flying over her head desperately trying to smooth down her mussed curls.</p><p>“Agatha Leandra Harkness, by the grace of God you better not be doing what I think you’re doing.”</p><p>Evanora's voice echoed through the stairwell sending a shiver down her spine. Anytime she used her full name Agatha knew she was in for it.</p><p>Her father had chosen the middle name Leandra, after one of his mistresses, she had later learned. She had the misfortune of carrying it with her for the rest of her life, as if she needed another reason for her mother to despise her.</p><p>Her door swung open harshly slamming against the wall inside her room.</p><p>“You look guilty as sin” her mother accused, holding out her hand. “Give me the phone.”</p><p>“I don’t have it.” Agatha tried, but her voice shook just enough to give her away.</p><p>Evanora scoffed, taking another step forward into Agatha’s space.</p><p>“If I find out you’ve been trying to ruin your progress I will send you back to father Michael for more one on one care.”</p><p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Agatha said, trying her best to hold her mother’s gaze.</p><p>“Oh you don’t?” Evanora's voice was dripping with venom, “so when I find this “missing” phone I won’t see that you’ve been talking to that depraved girl Ralph told me about.”</p><p>Agatha flinched as if the words were a physical blow. Rio was so far from any word her mother or the church would use to describe her. Rio was good, she was kind, she was a light in the darkness.</p><p>Her mother continued, “No daughter of mine will spend her time talking to a perverted dyke. She’s doing the devil's work Agatha, if you weren’t so naive you would see that.”</p><p>She felt the shame wash over her, but it was different this time. It wasn’t for anything she felt for Rio, it was shame that she was letting her mother talk about her like this. That she was letting her spew hatred, coating Agatha’s whole fucking life in it.</p><p>Her vision blurred at the edges, she took a step back from her mother, stumbling around the corner of her bed frame.</p><p>“Agatha,” her mother warned. She took another step towards her, cornering her.</p><p>She reached out, gripping Agatha’s chin tightly, sharp nails digging into the edges of her jaw. “Give me the phone.”</p><p>When Agatha didn’t respond she tightened her grip, nails cutting into her face. Agatha let out a small whimper, trying desperately to ignore the pain.</p><p>Evanora pushed forward, forcing Agatha’s back against the wall. She let out a low growl, losing any patience she had left, “You will obey your mother, you disgusting, sinful little girl.”</p><p>Agatha could feel her hands trembling at her side. Suddenly she was 5 years old all over again, cowering in this same corner. Her mother ruling over their house with an iron fist wrapped in a rosary.</p><p>Punishment disguised as salvation. Nothing ever really changed. The words were different but her mother meant them all the same.</p><p>Agatha slowly reached down, pulling the phone from the back waistband of her skirt.</p><p>Her mother snatched the phone from her hand and promptly threw it to the ground, the screen shattering under Evanora's heeled boot.</p><p>“Father Michael will see you this afternoon” she said matter of factly, letting go of her face with a harsh tug.</p><p>Agatha’s knees wobbled as she watched her mother walk out of her room, once she was finally gone she let herself slide to the floor. A steady stream of tears trailing down her still flushed cheeks.</p><p>-</p><p>Father Michael’s office was in the church basement. She sat across from him as the light seeped through the dirt stained window. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead. It had been 4 hours already.</p><p>“Agatha, what you must understand is that these desires are immoral, this lifestyle will lead to nothing but suffering.”</p><p>Agatha could feel her eyes glazing over as he leaned back in his chair, reaching for the metronome. He placed it on the desk in front of her. “We are going to try this again. This time when you hear the metronome start I need you to close your eyes and visualize a man.”</p><p>“A man?” Agatha asked weakly. She hadn’t eaten in hours. Each session she was deprived of food and water so she wouldn’t get distracted, wouldn’t need to use the bathroom, would have no reason to break the progress of the session.</p><p>“Yes, I need you to visualize a man. One that you desire.” He stood up then, moving towards the side of the room and flicking the light switch off.</p><p>Agatha could hear her breath coming out unsteady, now basked in only the dim light from the too small window.</p><p>The familiar click of the metronome started and like clock work, Agatha’s eyes fell shut.</p><p>“I want you to think of all of the things you like about this man.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly, her mind working towards an image of desire. It started with lithe fingers, strong forearms, tan skin.</p><p>“I want you to think of what makes you desire this man. Maybe he is strong, or smart, or a good provider.” The priest continued in the same haunting tone he’d been using for hours.</p><p>The mental image became more clear, a toned stomach with a trail of dark hair leading downwards, black hair long and luscious falling over broad shoulders.</p><p>“I want you to picture yourself with this man. You can be together in the way that only a man and woman should be. In the way that God intended.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart skipped as her own hands joined the image she was painting in her mind. Her fingers brushing up the sides of a ribcage that wasn’t her own, stopping when they reached the underside of full breasts with nipples pierced and erect.</p><p>“Put your trust in God. This is what he wants for you, this is how you inherit his kingdom.”</p><p>The metronome continued to click steadily as Agatha imagined Rio’s soft laugh, at the gasp she would let out as Agatha brushed sharp nails over her chest.</p><p>“This is who you are, Agatha. This is who you’re meant to be with. This is God's will.”</p><p>Rio’s face came into focus, the gap between her teeth, her pink tongue poking into her cheek.</p><p>“God's will” Agatha mumbled to herself. She imagined Rio’s soft lips finding her own, sharing each other's breath as their tongues tangled. She imagined the weight of Rio pressed against her in the bathroom at school, on her comforter, in her ex-boyfriend's bedroom.</p><p>She wasn’t sure how long it had been. Maybe minutes, maybe hours. It didn’t matter anyways. The metronome clicked steadily as everything fell into place.</p><p>It was never going to work. No matter how hard everyone tried to convince her she was broken, they weren’t going to make her believe it anymore. Not when Rio was filling her mind with stunning clarity. She would stay in her divinity as long as she could. God’s will.</p><p>The lights flickered back on, humming to life. Agatha blinked slowly as the room came into focus.</p><p>She looked up at the confusion on Father Michael's face before she began to turn towards the door where his eyes were nervously darting back and forth between Agatha and the person who had interrupted their session.</p><p>Agatha had to physically brace herself, sure she would see her mother standing in the doorway ready to drag her back to confession.</p><p>“What the fuck is going on here.” She heard a familiar voice crack through the room.</p><p>The metronome continued to click.</p><p>Her eyes met Rio’s and her chest finally cracked open.</p>

<p>Rio was brushing her thumbs over Agatha’s cheeks again and again. She had a small crease between her brow. Big brown eyes filled with unspoken concern.</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to ask what was wrong but all that escaped was a choked sob.</p><p>Oh. She was crying.</p><p>Actually, correction, she was sobbing. That’s why Rio’s face looked like that.</p><p>“Shh shh, it’s okay I’ve got you.” She pulled Agatha into a gentle hug, murmuring into her hair “I’ve got you.”</p><p>Agatha buried her face in the crook of Rio’s neck, tears still streaming down her face.</p><p>“I’m getting your shirt wet” she murmured into Rio’s skin. She felt Rio’s body shake slightly as she laughed. “It’s fine baby.”</p><p>Baby. Agatha melted at the nickname, nails digging into Rio’s shoulder blades as her hand ran up and down her back trying to soothe her.</p><p>They were outside of the church now, standing in the parking lot. The cool November breeze was blowing through the trees sending a shiver down Agatha’s spine.</p><p>Rio must have felt it, her hands tightening briefly before she let go. “Let’s get you warmed up.”</p><p>She opened the passenger door ushering Agatha into her seat. She leaned over her buckling her seatbelt.</p><p>She couldn’t help but notice that Rio was treating her like some fragile thing. Like if she said the the wrong thing Agatha might shatter into a million little pieces.</p><p>To be fair that didn’t feel very far outside of the realm of possibilities.</p><p>As she settled into Rio’s car, breathing in the familiar scent of Vanilla and a forest green air freshener she realized just how tired she was. Exhausted really.</p><p>She heard the driver door click, Rio sliding into the seat beside her.</p><p>She didn’t have the energy to speak, she let her head lull to the side so she was facing Rio, hoping she could communicate the exhaustion through her expression alone.</p><p>It seemed to work because Rio reached forward, starting the car. Her hand moving from the gear shift to Agatha’s thigh, giving it a gentle squeeze. “You should rest.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly, a lazy smile spreading across her face as she felt her eyelids growing heavier and heavier.</p><p>When she dreamed, she dreamed of Rio. She dreamed of that night alone in Rio’s apartment, cleaning up half empty beer bottles and red solo cups by the dozen. She dreamed about Rio’s intense gaze. She dreamed of what it would have been like if she was brave. If she had pressed Rio up against the door of her apartment to silence her relentless line of questioning. She dreamed of what it would have felt like to get exactly what she wanted exactly when she wanted it.</p><p>The sound of the car engine cutting pulled her out of the dream.</p><p>She blinked a few times, eyes still blurry with sleep.<br/>
“Where are we?” She asked cautiously.</p><p>“We’re at a diner.” Rio shrugged, “I thought maybe you could use some food.”</p><p>As if on queue Agatha’s stomach growled loudly causing a slow smile to creep across Rio’s face.</p><p>“Guess that answers my question” she said with a soft chuckle.</p><p>She let Rio come around and help her out of the car, let herself be led into the diner. She even let Rio order the food for her. She was in no state to be a functioning member of society.</p><p>The waitress slid a pile of pancakes in front of her, bacon and eggs on the side.</p><p>All Agatha could do was stare at Rio, “breakfast?” She asked, it was well past 5pm.</p><p>Rio just nodded, grabbing the burger in front of her. “You like breakfast.” She stated simply.</p><p>And it was true, but how did Rio know that?</p><p>Rio chuckled softly as if reading her mind. “Anytime we go out after lecture you get breakfast, no matter what time of the day it is.”</p><p>Agatha paused, fork resting against her palm staring into Rio’s endlessly brown eyes. Rio had been paying attention to her. For far longer than she realized it seemed.</p><p>Something sharp and warm spread through Agatha’s chest at the realization. Even when she had felt completely alone, Rio was there, Rio had noticed. Rio had made an effort to know her. The real her.</p><p>“What?” Rio asked suddenly, “Did I get it wrong?” She asked, her nerves creeping into her voice.</p><p>“NO” Agatha blurted out, a few heads in the diner turning in her direction.</p><p>She straightened her shoulders and tried again, “I mean no, you… you got it right.” She shook her head slightly, “you got it so right Rio” she said in a near whisper.</p><p>Understanding seemed to wash over Rio, her eyebrows raising and then flattening across her forehead. Agatha wasn’t just talking about her favourite meal of the day. She was talking about everything.</p><p>Somehow Rio was able to look past the fake bravado and see Agatha. The real Agatha. It was something even her closest friends struggled to do, Jen constantly badgering her for being “emotionally unavailable”. Well sue her for holding her cards close to her chest, she didn’t exactly have a lot of people in her life that made her want to open up.</p><p>Rio let out a soft hum, hand stretching across the table. Her thumb brushed against Agatha’s clenched fist. “Do you want to talk about it?” She asked gently.</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, jaw clenching at the idea of baring a part of herself that was still so raw.</p><p>“I um— I want to.” She started slowly, before glancing back down at her plate as she muttered “I’m just not sure how.”</p><p>“Why don’t we start from the beginning?” Rio asked softly. “Maybe Halloween?”</p><p>Agatha let out a harsh laugh, shaking her head. “That was hardly the beginning.”</p><p>Rio’s brow furrowed in confusion, “what do you mean?”</p><p>Agatha looked up at her incredulously. “Rio, do you have any idea how long I’ve wanted this? Wanted you?” She asked genuinely.</p><p>Rio gaped at her, jaw hanging ajar at the implication.</p><p>Agatha chuckled softly, reaching out to touch the underside of Rio’s chin, bringing her jaw back together jokingly.</p><p>She could see the flush spread from Rio’s neck up to her cheeks at the gesture.</p><p>What a lovely surprise. She had assumed Rio knew. She’d figured she was too obvious about it. Especially that night at her apartment, after Ralph and his stupid friends had dared them to kiss.</p><p>She remembered it like it was yesterday.</p><p>…</p><p>“Okay who’s up next?” Tony demanded.</p><p>Agatha fought the urge to roll her eyes, Tony was a douche bag. Two years older than the rest of Ralph’s friends, she couldn’t fucking wait until he graduated so he would get lost.</p><p>“Oh me!” Wanda exclaimed, drunk out of her mind.</p><p>“No Wands you already went” he slurred.</p><p>His eyes wandered, “how about…” he trailed off tapping his chin before his eyes locked on Agatha.</p><p>“Harkness.” He said with a sneer.</p><p>Agatha glanced at Ralph hoping he might save her but he just shrugged, a grin spreading across his face.</p><p>“Fine.” Agatha bit out. “Dare.”</p><p>Tony’s eyes lit up in excitement, Agatha wanted to bash his head against the nearest wall.</p><p>“I dare you…” he started slowly , “to kiss Rio.”</p><p>At the sound of her name Rio’s eyes darted up from the beer she had been pouring from the keg.</p><p>Her brow was furrowed in confusion as if she had only caught her name at the end of an otherwise unknown sentence. Agatha bit her lip to hold back a grin, Rio looked cute when she was confused.</p><p>Her ears were ringing like something had exploded right beside her, she could barely make out Ralph’s voice saying “yeah, Agatha I dare you.”</p><p>The fucking prick surely got off on shit like this. She wouldn’t dare look at his search history.</p><p>She was acutely aware that she was taking far too long to answer. The problem was that she did want to kiss Rio. Just not like this. Not with everyone watching, mocking, making it into something palatable for them to consume. It wouldn’t matter if she meant it, not like this.</p><p>Out of the corner of her eye she saw Rio crossing the room, making her way towards the group that had gathered around her.</p><p>“Did I hear my name?” She asked innocently, her cheeks flushed from the alcohol. Tank top clinging to her chest, showing off the toned length of her arms. Her fingers were curled around a red cup, filled to the brim with a frothy beer.</p><p>“You sure did vidyk—” Tony was cut off by Ralph's hand slapping harshly over his mouth.</p><p>Agatha was fuming. She was trying her best to keep it under wraps but her hands were shaking almost violently by her side as she watched the interaction.</p><p>“WE” she finally spoke, voice coming out in a shout. After a few heads turned towards her at the volume she lowered her voice before she continued, “we aren’t doing that.”</p><p>“Doing what?” Rio asked, still confused.</p><p>God she was too nice for her own good. Why had she invited these fucking losers to her party? Just because they were friends with her friends? Wanda and Vision could use to spend one weekend apart.</p><p>“Making out.” Tony said with a sly grin.</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows jumped at that, glancing in Agatha’s direction.</p><p>Agatha shook her head, dropping her gaze. She couldn't bear to look Rio in the eyes for too long, she felt like she might lose herself completely in the deep honeyed brown.<br/>
…</p><p>She heard Rio clear her throat, trying to catch her attention. “Uh how long?” Rio asked nervously.</p><p>“If I’m honest,” Agatha started, “probably since I first saw you.”</p><p>Rio scoffed at that. “Agatha be serious, you’ve been with Ralph every day since I met you.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head gently.</p><p>“Rio, do you remember what you wore to our first poly sci lecture last year?”</p><p>Rio’s mouth puckered, eyes searching Agatha's face for answers to the unexpected question. “Definitely not.” She said with an eyebrow quirked.</p><p>“You were wearing forest green slacks and a white button down with a matching blazer. You were more dressed up than anyone else there. I remember thinking you were such a suck up and that your ass looked amazing in those pants.”</p><p>Rio just stared back at her.</p><p>“I’ve been watching you, Rio, just like you watch everybody else.” It wasn’t a threat, just the truth.</p><p>Rio’s eyes met hers slowly. “I’m going to need you to tell me everything.”</p>

<p>Rio’s mind was racing. It had been one of the most chaotic days of her life.</p><p>After Agatha had abruptly ended their call Rio had panicked. She had texted Alice, who told her to text Wanda. She’d texted Wanda, then called her, then texted again. Then she’d texted Jen to ask why the fuck Wanda wasn’t answering her.</p><p>Apparently she had been in a chemistry lab. Her phone left in the lab room locker.</p><p>Rio had honest to god googled Evanora Harkness just to figure out which direction to drive in. Luckily her contributions to the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception were heavily documented online so Rio already knew her first stop.</p><p>As she pulled up to the church her hands were trembling against the steering wheel. She had no idea what she was walking into. Her family was religious, sure, but not like this.</p><p>She put the car in park and walked towards the large wooden double doors. She pulled lightly on the handle and was met with no resistance, slipping into the church soundlessly.</p><p>Once inside she took in the grand ceiling, row upon row of pews painted in a variety of colours from the sun pouring in through the intricate stained glass windows.</p><p>There were two large wooden confessionals by the altar and several candles flickering gently on the opposite side in memoriam.</p><p>The church itself was quiet, Rio was almost certain there was no one in the confessionals but she couldn’t stop herself from checking for Agatha just in case.</p><p>She walked quickly along the aisle, careful not to make a noise that might alert anyone that she was here. Once she reached the first confessional she pushed gently on the wooden door, holding her breath.</p><p>The door swung open revealing an empty stool and partition. Still holding her breath she did the same to the next confessional. At the sight of another empty space the air rushed out of her lungs, relief and panic flooding her. If Agatha wasn’t here, where on earth was she?</p><p>As if by divine intervention she heard the loud scratch of a chair across the floor below her. It echoed in the otherwise empty church. It dawned on her then, there was a basement.</p><p>Rio was a fan of horror movies and she had watched enough to know that nothing good was ever waiting for you in a church basement. She shook out her clenched fists as she walked back towards the front doors. This wasn’t a movie, this wasn’t some twisted plot line, this was Agatha. She needed to save Agatha.</p><p>She walked through the first set of doors connecting the church to the outside and quickly found the door with the staircase leading to the basement.</p><p>The steps squeaked underneath her as she made her slow descent. When she was almost at the bottom she could hear the soft murmur of a man’s voice, muffled by the heavy wooden doors.</p><p>She walked slowly towards the source of the sound. As she got closer she could just barely make out what he was saying “yourself with this man — this is God's will” The voice fading in and out of range.</p><p>Rio couldn’t hear anything beyond the man’s voice and a soft ticking that sounded suspiciously close to a metronome.</p><p>There was no real indicator that Agatha was behind the closed door but something inside of Rio made her twitch forward, hand reaching for the door handle. She pulled it open with so much force it rattled on its hinges.</p><p>She found that she had been right about two things. First, that was in fact a metronome she had heard and second, the mane of curly brown locks flowing over the chair in front of her most definitely belonged to Agatha.</p><p>The man standing behind the desk facing Agatha froze. His eyes darted to meet Rio’s, he looked almost, afraid?</p><p>Before she could help herself she felt the words spilling harshly out of her mouth.</p><p>“What the fuck is going on here.” It was a demand more than a question.</p><p>She registered Agatha’s head snapping back, eyes desperately trying to meet hers but her gaze stayed locked on what she could only assume was the priest.</p><p>He took a step around the desk towards Agatha.</p><p>“Don’t you fucking dare.” Rio spat. “Lay a hand on her and I will fucking end you.” She growled.</p><p>The priest stopped in his tracks. Outstretched hands slowly withdrawing towards himself.</p><p>“I was just undoing the restraints.” He stuttered out pointing towards Agatha’s wrists.</p><p>Rio’s heart dropped. She took a closer look at Agatha, both of her wrists were pinned to the arms of the chair by leather restraints.</p><p>Rio choked back the gasp that threatened to escape from her throat. What the fuck had they been doing to her down here. Her chest felt like it might split clean down the middle if she thought about it for too long.</p><p>“Don’t. Fucking. Touch. Her.” Rio enunciated every word, forcing her feet to work once again so she could make her way towards Agatha.</p><p>When she finally got to the chair, she looked down at Agatha, there was recognition in her eyes but it was cloudy.</p><p>She reached forward gently, trying to brush the hair that had fallen into her face back behind her ear but Agatha flinched harshly.</p><p>Rio dropped down to her knees, trying to put herself closer to Agatha’s level.</p><p>“Baby it’s me.” She paused, “it’s Rio.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond, she just stared forward blankly.</p><p>Okay, she needed to get her the fuck out of here. Now.</p><p>She leaned forward, pulling at the leather restraints on her wrist. She worked one wrist free, gently placing it in Agatha’s lap while she worked on the next one.</p><p>Once both were free she looked back at Agatha’s face trying desperately to make eye contact, to find some kind of understanding behind the blank stare in her eyes.</p><p>She waited for a moment. No such luck. As she reached out to pull Agatha out of the chair she heard the priest speak again.</p><p>He cleared his throat loudly, “Evanora will want to know where she is.” He paused, “she won’t stop until she finds her.”</p><p>Rio turned to him, voice dripping with venom as she spat back, “Evanora doesn’t need to worry about looking for Agatha, because I’m going to find her first.” She let a sinister smile spread across her face, “and she’s going to wish I never had.”</p><p>At that, she reached around Agatha’s back pulling her up and out of chair. As she had expected, Agatha stumbled forward into her, not ready to support her own weight. Rio looped an arm around her waist, taking one of Agatha’s arms around her neck.</p><p>She did her best to guide them back up the staircase wobbling slightly as they took the last couple of steps out of the church.</p><p>The cold November air rushed over Rio, biting at her face. She tightened her grip on Agatha’s waist as she guided them down the front steps towards her car.</p><p>The cold seemed to awaken something in Agatha as well, she could feel the goosebumps spreading across the arm she still had slung around Rio’s neck.</p><p>Once they were beside her old Honda she felt Agatha shift, turning her body inwards. Her eyes were glassy as she reached her free hand out towards Rio’s face.</p><p>“You’re here.” She whispered, almost to herself.</p><p>“You’re real.”</p><p>-</p><p>Rio tried her best to school her expression at Agatha’s confession. She had been watching Rio this entire time.</p><p>“I’m going to need you to tell me everything.”</p><p>Rio had felt Agatha’s eyes on her before, stolen moments during class, at parties, out at the bar with their friends. But after their fight at Rio’s apartment she had assumed Agatha was watching her because she was uncomfortable. That the stare was judgemental instead of longing.</p><p>Agatha gave a small nod, still picking at her food. Rio had never seen her look so fragile, it made her stomach clench.</p><p>The deep sadness she felt was quickly replaced by anger when her eyes flickered over the light yellow bruises fading on Agatha’s wrists.</p><p>She reached out to trace her hand over them. They were in the same place where the restraints had held her to the chair in the basement. They looked old. Faded, as if she had resisted the first few times, but had eventually given up. No new bruises blooming in their place.</p><p>Agatha flinched at the featherlight touch and Rio pulled her hand back quickly, as if she’d been burnt. Agatha glanced up at her then, “I will tell you everything, I promise, just… not right now.”</p><p>Rio nodded in understanding. Agatha was in survival mode, she needed to get her out of here. Needed to bring her somewhere she felt safe.</p><p>As if Agatha could read her mind she put her fork down, “everything is still at my Mother’s house.” She paused shakily, “my phone, my laptop, my wallet… she even took my fucking passport.” Agatha said with a small incredulous laugh.</p><p>Rio reached out again, taking her hand more slowly this time. She gave it a reassuring squeeze.</p><p>“We’ll get it all back.” She licked her lips slowly, “and I’ll try my best not to commit any serious criminal offences.”</p><p>Agatha let out a humourless laugh. “I wouldn’t hold it against you if you did.”</p><p>“Don’t encourage me, I’m on the brink.” Rio said, tone light but they both knew she wasn’t joking.</p><p>Agatha squeezed her hand back. They stayed that way, hand in hand, for the next few minutes before Rio motioned for the waitress to bring them their bill.</p><p>“You’ll have to tell me how to get there.” She said alluding to Evanora's house. Agatha was biting the skin off her bottom lip in the passenger seat.</p><p>“You don’t need to come in with me.” Rio reassured, hand moving from the gear shift to rest on Agatha’s knee. “Just tell me where everything is and I will find it.”</p><p>“What if she’s home?”</p><p>“For her own sake, she better not be.” Rio muttered under her breath.</p><p>Rio was normally a calm person, the rational one, the peacekeeper. Today however, she was none of those things. She was worried about what she might do to Evanora if she was given the chance.</p><p>Rio turned onto a quiet street with some of the largest houses she had ever seen. “It’s number 13.” Agatha pointed towards a large brick house with a white picket fence, it held the illusion of perfection. An American flag blowing valiantly in the wind. a solitary rocking chair on the wrap around porch.</p><p>As Rio pulled up she noticed a light on, it was nearly dusk now and she could make out the shadow of a figure walking across the room.</p><p>Agatha must have noticed at the same time. “Fuck, she’s home.” Rio felt a rush at the prospect of actually being able to confront Agatha’s cunt of a Mother.</p><p>Rio put the car in park two houses away across the street. She turned in her seat to face Agatha fully. “Once I’m inside, which way do I go?”</p><p>“Rio, I can’t let you go in there alone.”</p><p>“I’m not letting you go back into that house.” Rio said through gritted teeth. She wasn’t giving Evanora the chance to dig her claws in any deeper.</p><p>“You- you don’t know what she’s like. You don’t know what she’ll say.” Agatha paused, audibly swallowing, “what she’ll do.”</p><p>Rio squeezed the hand still resting on Agatha’s knee. “I’ll be quick.”</p><p>Agatha just stared at her.</p><p>“Please, just- just let me do this for you.” Rio begged.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers came up to her mouth, now working with her teeth to tear the skin off her lip. She seemed to be fighting an internal battle until her eyes finally met Rio’s.</p><p>“Once you’re in the foyer go to the left, the first door on the right is her study and she keeps everything in the top drawer of her desk. It’s usually locked but there is a key hidden on the book shelf  under the bible.”</p><p>Rio nodded once in understanding, giving Agatha’s knee a final squeeze before she opened the car door.</p><p>“I’ll be back.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers were drumming against her thighs nervously.</p><p>“Promise me, you’ll stay out here?”</p><p>“I promise.”</p>

<p>Sitting tucked away in Rio’s passenger seat, taking deep breaths to try to calm herself down, Agatha's mind drifted to the first time she’d met Rio.</p><p>-</p><p>“Who is that?” Vis whispered to her under his breath.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, it was the second semester of their undergrad and this man was obsessed with pursuing girls who were out of his league. And this girl in particular? She was so far out of his league Agatha had to stop herself from laughing in his face.</p><p>She was wearing a white button down tucked into slacks under a dark green blazer that made her eyes glow a light hazel brown. She was laughing with the curly haired blonde beside her, a small gap between her front teeth.</p><p>She had a sharp jawline and a soft sloping nose, brown hair in a blunt cut just above her shoulders. As she turned around Agatha’s eyes dipped. She also had an incredible ass. Objectively of course. Agatha could appreciate a good ass when she saw one, it didn’t mean anything that this one just happened to be attached to a woman. Right?</p><p>Agatha shook her head to rid it of her racing thoughts. Who the fuck wore a blazer to the first day of class anyways. She was clearly a huge suck up. She leaned over to Vis to whisper “Never gonna happen man.”</p><p>As if she could hear them, the girl whipped her head in their direction. Hazel eyes gliding over Vis and lingering on Agatha. After too long for plausible deniability Agatha glanced down. She clenched her fists in her lap taking a deep breath before looking up to see the same eyes still locked on her. The girl's tongue pushed into the side of her cheek as she tucked her hair behind her ear.</p><p>She swallowed down a loud gulp as the girl moved around the desks towards her. Once she was an arms length away her hand came out, Agatha just stared at it blankly before her eyes finally flicked up.</p><p>“Hey, I’m Rio.”</p><p>-</p><p>Before she could process what was happening that same girl with the soft hazel eyes and adorable gap between her teeth was jumping into the driver's seat of the Honda Civic, bloody knuckles reaching for the gear shift. She jerked the shift into drive, pressing hard on the gas causing the tires to squeal as she pulled back onto the street and sped away.</p><p>“R-Rio, what happened?” Agatha gaped, staring at the crimson blood trickling down Rio’s wrist. “w-what did she do to you?”</p><p>Rio's jaw was clenched so tightly Agatha could see every muscle pulled taut across the side of her face.</p><p>Agatha reached out towards her. Soft. Tentative.</p><p>She brushed her hand across Rio’s wrist, trailing up to wrap her hand around her elbow. “Baby,” she said gently.</p><p>At that Rio’s eyes flicked towards hers, wide with fear and adrenaline. Her face softened, jaw relaxing. The knuckles that had whitened on the steering wheel flushed with colour again.</p><p>”She’s never going to hurt you again.”</p><p>Agatha's eyes widened at the insinuation. What the hell had happened in that house?</p><p>Rio seemed to register the alarm on Agatha’s face as she stuttered out “I just mean, she knows not to try anything like that.” She paused, taking her eyes off the road so she could look into Agatha’s eyes as she emphasized “Ever again.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly, swallowing back the sob that threatens to escape from her throat. Being free from Evanora sounded too good to be true.</p><p>She had assumed her mother would sooner have Agatha dead than allow her reputation to be tarnished by a daughter that was alive and well, and wanted absolutely nothing to do with her.</p><p>Rio reached into the pocket of her pants pulling out Agatha’s wallet and passport.</p><p>“I—” she paused, seemingly unsure for the first time that night, “I couldn’t get the laptop.” She glanced at Agatha again apologetically. She gingerly pulled Agatha’s shattered phone from her other pocket, “and I'm not sure we can salvage this.”</p><p>Agatha stared at Rio for a long minute, the silence suffocating them. The sound of the Honda humming and the flicker of streetlights crossing their faces in tandem.</p><p>And then, Agatha started to laugh. It began as a small chuckle. She almost considered disguising it with a cough, she knew it wasn’t exactly appropriate given how heavy the situation was, but she couldn’t help herself.</p><p>Here she was, sitting in Rio’s car with her phone in shards, Rio’s bloody knuckles dripping onto the console between them, the cold fall air seeping through the cracks in the door.</p><p>And she was gay, and Rio had most definitely hit her Mother, and she had never loved Ralph, in fact she had never even really liked him.</p><p>So she laughed, quiet at first, but before she could help it the sound was bubbling out of her throat, her whole body racked with maniacal laughter.</p><p>Rio looked over to her, eyebrows raised so high they nearly touched her hairline but she didn’t say anything.</p><p>And Agatha, well, she couldn’t stop laughing long enough to explain it to Rio, but even if she could she’s not sure she would have the words. So instead she just squeezed Rio’s elbow tightly, hoping it conveyed at least some of the message.</p><p>Rio kept stealing glances but the laughter didn’t subside, in fact it had taken over Agatha so completely that tears were streaming down the sides of her face. It was cathartic in a way but also freeing.</p><p>Agatha felt Rio’s bloodied hand come to wipe at her tears, a smear of blood staining her cheek which naturally, only made her laugh harder.</p><p>In her peripheral vision she saw the slight uptick of Rio’s lips and before she knew it Rio’s laughter joined hers, the sound filling the car like a harmony.</p><p>Agatha could feel the warmth spreading through her chest now, a loud snort leaving her nose that only caused Rio to laugh harder, hands coming back to grip the wheel as she pitched forward.</p><p>“Agatha” Rio said breathlessly, “I can’t focus.” She heaved between howls of laughter, “I need to pull over.”</p><p>She felt the car slowing to a stop as they turned off the road and into a sleepy looking motel parking lot. A few other cars were parked in front of the motel but the lot was otherwise empty. Not surprising considering it was nearly midnight now.</p><p>Rio shifted the car into park, killing the headlights. Agatha’s laughter slowly petering out. Then it was quiet again, the air heavy with what came next.</p><p>Rio looked at her, face painted with concern. “Agatha, what can I do?”</p><p>She let out a soft sigh, reaching out for Rio’s injured hand.</p><p>“Rio,” she tried to steady her voice, “you’ve done more for me than anyone I’ve ever known.” After a beat, “More than anyone who has ever claimed to love me.”</p><p>She slowly brought Rio's bloodied knuckles up to her lips giving them a gentle kiss. Rio’s fist clenched at the action, a soft whimper leaving her mouth from the pain that was likely radiating down her arm.</p><p>When Agatha pulled her hand away, Rio’s pupils were blown wide, she reached out her other hand towards Agatha but stopped just short of touching her lips.</p><p>“You-uhh, you’ve got some—”</p><p>Agatha's tongue flicked out instinctively licking her lips. The metallic tang flooded her mouth immediately. Rio’s blood. That is what she had been pointing out. She had smeared Rio’s blood from her knuckles across her lips. She locked eyes with Rio before slowly and more deliberately letting her tongue glide across her lips, taking more of the blood into her mouth.</p><p>She heard Rio’s sharp intake of breath and felt a rush of heat flood her chest. Rio’s eyes were darker than she had ever seen them as they examined her face. Rio seemed to be waiting for something. What exactly, Agatha wasn’t sure.</p><p>She searched Rio’s face for the answer, taking in her tense frame.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Rio was waiting for her permission.</p><p>She gave a barely perceptible nod and before she knew it Rio was on her, both hands wrapping tightly in her hair as she kissed her harshly. The moan that had been building deep in her chest finally escaped her lips.</p><p>Rio’s responding groan echoed against her mouth as she continued to kiss and lick her own blood off of Agatha’s lips. She let her tongue press against them, urgently begging for entrance. Agatha obliged happily. She let the feeling of Rio’s tongue pressing against hers, softly exploring her mouth, take over all of her senses.</p><p>Rio made quick work of climbing over the center console, her legs straddling Agatha’s as she settled into her lap, lips never breaking apart.</p><p>Agatha’s hands came up to Rio’s hips, pulling her down further. She wanted to feel every part of Rio pressed against her. Wanted desperately to get up close and personal with the nipple piercings that had pleasantly surprised her during their impromptu FaceTime.</p><p>It had felt weird at first, letting herself be exposed like that. But seeing Rio take her pleasure so willingly had inspired her. Or had at the very least inspired the wetness that had collected in her underwear until it was damn near unbearable. When Rio had finally asked to see her, Agatha hadn’t thought twice, stripping herself down. She had wanted Rio to see exactly what she was doing to her.</p><p>Agatha tried to lean forward into Rio’s space to kiss down the side of her neck. She was abruptly stopped by the locking of the seatbelt she had forgotten to undo. She tried and failed to click the release and free herself from it several times before she finally gave up. She pulled back from Rio with a curse, to look down at the button “Stupid- fucking—”</p><p>“Hey! Watch how you talk about Delilah” Rio chuckled, patting the dashboard behind her affectionately.</p><p>“Well, Delilah is being a cockblock” Agatha pouted.</p><p>Rio hummed, smirk spreading across her face, “More like running clitorference actually.”</p><p>Agatha barked out a laugh at the pure stupidity of it. Rio’s smirk grew into an honest smile at the sound.</p><p>It was just a stupid joke, she knew that. But Agatha couldn’t help the nervous flip her stomach did at the truth behind it. This was uncharted territory for her. It was one thing to know she wanted to be with Rio, to watch her come undone through a screen, it was another thing to actually do it.</p><p>Rio seemed to register the change in her energy, reaching out to squeeze her arm. “Hey, why don’t we see if they have any space” she gestured towards the motel. “It’s been a long day and I think we could both use the rest.” She explained gently.</p><p>Agatha’s brain stalled. A motel room. A night alone with Rio. No interruptions, no excuses.</p><p>As if she had spoken out loud Rio continued, “Nothing has to happen, we can just sleep.” She reached up to brush the deep purple bags underneath Agatha’s eyes before she said more quietly. “I know you need it.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, smiling faintly. She let her head lean into the brush of Rio’s fingers against her face. Let her eyes fall closed. She was so tired.</p><p>Rio's thumb brushed against her cheek slowly, her voice dropping to a murmur. “You’re safe now.”<br/>
-<br/>
They walked towards the motel room in silence, hand in hand, Rio flipping their key between her uninjured fingers.</p><p>The motel only had one room left for the night and Agatha tried her best to keep the relief that flooded her to herself. She couldn’t imagine trying to sleep in a room alone after everything that had happened today. The anxious feeling still lingered in her gut but as the minutes passed it had started to subside.</p><p>“Here we are,” Rio chirped, sliding the key into the door with a discoloured four on the front.</p><p>The door swung open and two things became immediately clear.</p><p>Number one, there was only one large bed sitting in the center of the room.</p><p>Number two, the feeling in her gut was no longer anxious. It had evolved into something far more dangerous.</p><p>Anticipation.</p>

<p>Agatha could feel the shift in the air as Rio noticed the lone bed in the center of the room.</p><p>“I- I - this was all they had left, it wasn’t on purpose.” Rio stuttered out.</p><p>Warmth spread through Agatha’s chest, it was a strange comfort, hearing the nervousness in Rio’s voice.</p><p>“I know.” she said, reaching out to give Rio’s elbow a reassuring squeeze.</p><p>She blew out a quiet breath before crossing the threshold into the room. Rio trailed closely behind her.</p><p>Once the door was locked and it was just them she felt an unexpected peace wash over her. This was just Rio. She knew Rio, she trusted Rio.</p><p>“I think I’m going to take a shower.” Rio said interrupting her thought, gesturing towards the blood drying on her knuckles and down her forearm.</p><p>“Oh yeah of course, I -uh, I’ll be out here.”</p><p>Duh. Where else would she be? God she was starting to feel like a fucking mess.</p><p>She turned on her heel quickly walking towards the bed.</p><p>Rio retreated quietly into the bathroom, the door left open a crack. Agatha heard the sound of the tap running before the shower started. Rio was humming softly, the melodic tune pouring out into the room.</p><p>Agatha sat on the edge of the bed trying her hardest not to look at the space where the bathroom light flooded out through the crack in the door. She wanted to give Rio privacy, she really did.</p><p>She pushed herself off the bed starting to pace the length of the room. Rio wanted her and she wanted Rio. This didn’t have to be complicated. The wanting was the easy part. The doing, the being, it was all a lot harder, all came a lot less naturally to Agatha than it did to most people.</p><p>She leaned against the wall at the end of the room, letting her hands settle on her knees as her head hung between her shoulders. She took deep breaths, trying her best to do the 5-4-3-2-1 method her school therapist had taught her.</p><p>5 things she could see. The dirty socks still on her feet. The bruises covering her wrists. The bed in the middle of the room. The shattered phone sitting on top of it. The curl of Rio’s hair as she flicked it over her bare shoulder, back to the door as she leaned over the bathroom sink.</p><p>4 things she could touch. The wallpaper as she pushed herself off the motel wall. The cool door handle of the bathroom. The soft skin of Rio’s waist as she turned her around. The warm press of her lips as Agatha leaned into her with the intent to consume.</p><p>3 things she could hear. A truck horn blaring down the highway outside the motel. The water from the shower pounding against the vinyl motel tiles. The gasp that escaped Rio’s lips as she kissed her.</p><p>2 things she could smell. The shitty motel soap. Rio’s perfume— still clinging to her skin— like honey and the earth after it rained.</p><p>1 thing she could taste. Rio’s tongue coated in syrup from the bite she had taken of Agatha’s diner pancakes.</p><p>If this was her new 5-4-3-2-1 she was pretty sure she would never have a panic attack again.</p><p>Rio pressed back on her shoulders, separating them briefly. “As amazing as this is, are you sure?” She asked gently. Eyes drifting back towards Agatha’s lips as she spoke.</p><p>“I want this Rio.” She took a centering breath, “I want you.”</p><p>Rio didn’t ask twice, crashing forward into Agatha, their lips meeting in a bruising kiss.</p><p>Agatha’s hands found purchase on Rio’s hips, pulling her flush against her. Rio tilted her head, deepening the kiss. Her tongue started a slow exploration of Agatha’s mouth. Along the tips of her teeth, across the inside of her cheeks, it was like she was trying to memorize her.</p><p>Agatha used her grip on Rio’s hips to flip them,  pushing her back against the bathroom door.</p><p>Agatha’s hands started a slow ascent up Rio’s bare stomach, brushing along her ribcage to the underside of her breasts. Rio let out a stuttering breath in anticipation. It was now or never, and Agatha wanted this. Wanted Rio in every way she could have her.</p><p>She let her thumbs graze gently over Rio’s already hardened nipples. Rio shivered against her at the soft touch.</p><p>Agatha gave an experimental squeeze. Rio responded immediately, groaning into Agatha’s mouth, her chest pushing forward into Agatha’s palms. Encouraging her.</p><p>Something about having Rio like this—malleable under her touch—so willing, was making her feel insane. A fresh wave of arousal flooded her, with her underwear still sitting on the floor of her old bedroom there was nothing to stop it from dripping down the inside of her thighs.</p><p>On the next drag of her thumbs, she took Rio’s piercings between her fingers giving them a gentle flick. The moan Rio let out at the sensation was nothing short of sinful.</p><p>“Fuck Agatha, do that again.”</p><p>And who was Agatha to deny her? She placed another light flick on the other side of the piercing as she moved her mouth to kiss down the column of Rio’s throat. She tasted intoxicating, something heady and addictive in each new piece of salty skin Agatha got her mouth on.</p><p>Rio’s hands found their way into her hair, fingers threading through the knotted locks.</p><p>Agatha’s back went rigid at the touch. Her mind flashing back to the way her mother’s hands had gathered the hair at the base of her skull, pulling her down the stairs and towards the car. The way she had yanked harshly at the roots so Agatha couldn’t run away.</p><p>“S-stop” she stuttered out, so quietly she wasn’t sure Rio would even hear it.</p><p>But Rio was nothing if not observant. She released her hold on Agatha immediately, brow furrowing in concern.</p><p>“Hey, baby- hey, what’s happening?” She asked, brushing her hands down Agatha’s arms.</p><p>“I-just,” she paused trying to collect her thoughts. “My hair is all messed up, from my mom.” She finished quietly.</p><p>Rio seemed to understand immediately.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio looked at her thoughtfully, “can I help you get the knots out?”</p><p>Agatha looked at her blankly for a moment before Rio gestured towards the shower.</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Rio wanted them to shower together. It’s not that she didn’t want that. She did, so badly. She just had scars she wasn’t sure how to explain to Rio. Scars that Ralph had never asked about, had maybe never even noticed. But she knew Rio would.</p><p>Rio seemed to sense her hesitation, taking it as a rejection. She cast her eyes down, “never mind, it was stupid, I’ll just finish up in here and then it’s all yours.”</p><p>Agatha reached up, thumb brushing over Rio’s cheek. “Rio,” she paused,  “that’s not it, I just- I have scars.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened briefly, searching Agatha’s. “I won’t ask if you don’t want me to.” She said, biting the loose skin on the edge of her bottom lip.</p><p>“Okay.” Agatha nodded. She would explain it all to Rio. One day. When she was ready.</p><p>She reached down, hands closing over the end of her shirt as she pulled it up and over her head. She was wearing a white cotton bra underneath. She couldn’t get it off of herself fast enough, every piece of clothing a reminder of the power her mother tried to hold over her.</p><p>She unclasped the bra, quickly pushing it off of her shoulders. She let the bra fall to the floor as she pushed down the skirt, letting it pool at her feet.</p><p>She looked down, taking herself in. She was completely bare but she finally felt like herself again. Not some dressed up, repressed version of her.</p><p>Rio maintained eye contact with her, Agatha was sure she was trying to be polite, trying not to make her uncomfortable. But Agatha wanted her to look, wanted her to stare. She wanted Rio’s mouth to water at the sight of her.</p><p>“Rio.” Hazel eyes blinked at her slowly, “you can look, I want you to look.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes dropped immediately, drinking in every inch of Agatha’s exposed skin. Her eyes lingered on Agatha’s breast, finally seeing them for the first time.</p><p>“Can I?” Rio asked, reaching forward.</p><p>Agatha hummed in response “mhmm.”</p><p>Rio’s hands reached out, brushing across Agatha’s collarbones and down her chest. She stopped just above Agatha’s breasts, eyes flicking up to meet hers again.</p><p>She gave a small nod and Rio’s hands moved down, brushing over her nipples. They hardened at the touch as Rio gave them a firm pinch. Agatha’s head fell back at the feeling, hair cascading down her back.</p><p>“Fuck, Rio, that feels good.”</p><p>Rio’s tongue poked into her cheek, “I know what would feel even better.” She said, leaning forward to catch a pert nipple in her mouth.</p><p>Agatha twitched at the feeling, arching into Rio, begging her for more. Rio’s tongue laved her nipple, drawing smooth circles around the hardened bud before nipping it with her teeth. The mix of pain and pleasure shot straight to her core.</p><p>Rio pried her mouth away from Agatha’s chest long enough to unceremoniously push down her pants, taking her boxers with them.</p><p>Then it was just the two of them. Stripped down and bare. Nothing to hide anymore, their desire on display. Agatha’s eyes flicked down to the thatch of curly black hair between Rio’s legs. Something she hadn’t been able to see during their last call.</p><p>She could see Rio’s slick glinting off the coarse curls in the harsh overhead lighting of the motel bathroom. Proof that Rio wanted her, that the feeling was reciprocated.</p><p>When her eyes traveled back up to meet Rio’s the corners of her mouth were ticked up into a smirk.</p><p>“Like what you see?” She asked, raising a brow.</p><p>Agatha swallowed harshly. “Fuck yes.” Her eyes flicked back down. “Is that because of me?” She asked genuinely.</p><p>Sure Ralph was into her, she got him hard, got him off. It was easy but it really always seemed like it was more about him than it was about her. He just wanted to be touched, to be fucked. It didn’t really matter if Agatha was the one doing it or not.</p><p>Now, here she was, barely having touched Rio and she was already dripping wet for her. She’d never experienced anything quite like it.</p><p>Rio nodded, locking eyes with her. She let her hand trail down her body, dipping in between her legs, her fingers coming out slick and shiny. “This is all for you.”</p><p>Without thinking, Agatha reached for Rio’s wet fingers, bringing them to her lips. She let the taste of Rio flood her mouth, allowing her tongue to lick up the slick between her fingers all while Rio watched her slack jawed.</p><p>Agatha hummed thoughtfully. Rio tasted good. A sharp sweetness with a hint of salt from the sweat of the day.</p><p>“Come on.” Rio prompted, grabbing Agatha with her free hand and leading her towards the shower. Once she stepped inside the hot water pelted her shoulders, softening the tension in her body. She felt herself melt into Rio’s touch as she turned to face the steady stream of water.</p><p>Rio’s hand worked to lather her back with soap, massaging the sore muscles as she worked her way down. She stopped at her lower back, lingering there before Agatha glanced over her shoulder “you can.” She said softly.</p><p>Rio smiled, letting her hands trail lower, squeezing each ass cheek as she lathered them in suds.</p><p>She worked downwards, hands over tight hamstrings and stiff calves. She felt Rio’s hands trail back up to her hips, turning her around slowly.</p><p>She let the steady stream of the shower soak through her hair before she opened her eyes. To her surprise Rio wasn’t in front of her, not at eye level at least. She was on her knees on the shower floor, picking up Agatha’s legs and scrubbing one foot at a time.</p><p>She was slow, methodical. She let her touch linger, massaging pressure points and loosening muscles.</p><p>Then she leaned forward, planting a soft kiss on the inside of Agatha’s knee. Agatha inhaled sharply, goosebumps spreading up her thigh despite the warmth of the shower. Only then did Rio look up, locking eyes with Agatha.</p><p>“Tell me what you want.” She murmured into the side of her thigh.</p><p>“I want you.” Agatha breathed out.</p><p>“How?”</p><p>“I want your mouth.”</p><p>Agatha could feel the press of Rio’s smile on the soft skin of her thigh.</p><p>“It’s all yours baby” Rio replied, letting her lips drift upwards, planting messy open mouthed kisses on Agatha’s thigh as she went. She used her grip on Agatha’s hips to turn her out of the spray from the shower and press her back into the cool tile of the wall.</p><p>A shiver ran through Agatha at the sensation as Rio’s tongue made its way closer and closer to where Agatha needed her most.</p><p>Rio’s nose brushed against her neatly trimmed curls, tongue licking up the slick that had dripped down her legs. Rio hummed happily.</p><p>“You taste,” she paused for a moment and Agatha held her breath.</p><p>Ralph had never once told her she tasted good. In fact he had said quite the opposite, complaining that she was too salty, or too sweet or too tangy. Sometimes even too dry— I wonder who’s fault that was. She was always too much of something, so eventually, she had given up on it completely.</p><p>Rio’s hands curled around her thighs, lifting one over her shoulder opening Agatha up to her. “You taste so fucking good.”</p><p>Agatha squeezed her eyes shut, a flush spreading across her chest at the praise. Before she could open her eyes again she felt Rio lick a broad strip across the length of her cunt. She let her tongue slow, stopping just short of Agatha clit.</p><p>Agatha whimpered. She wanted the stimulation, fucking needed it.</p><p>“Rio please, she begged.” hips canting towards Rio’s face.</p><p>Rio looked up from where she was kneeling on the shower floor, droplets of water still clinging to her thick black lashes.</p><p>“Please what baby?” She asked with a small smirk, her lips shiny with Agatha’s slick.</p><p>“Please put your mouth on me.”</p><p>“My mouth was on you.” Rio tutted innocently.</p><p>Agatha groaned, letting her head fall back against the shower wall with a thud. “You know what I mean.”</p><p>“Show me where you want my mouth Agatha.” She said reaching out to place Agatha’s hand on the back of her head, Agatha’s hand rested hesitantly on top of Rio’s hair, smoothing down the baby hairs that were sticking up now from the humidity of the shower.</p><p>Rio’s hand tightened over Agatha’s, pushing her hand deeper into silky black locks.</p><p>“You can take what you need.” Rio paused looking up at her with blown out pupils, “you don’t need to be gentle.”</p><p>Agatha bit back a moan at that, hand curling deeper into Rio’s hair, clinging to the roots as she used her grip to pull Rio’s head forward. When Rio’s tongue met Agatha's clit it sent a sharp jolt of pleasure through her. Agatha’s legs twitched around Rio’s face at the feeling.</p><p>Rio quickly flattened her tongue giving control over to Agatha. She let Agatha pull her hair again, holding her still so Agatha could press her cunt forward into Rio’s mouth, each roll of her hips causing a new wave of pleasure to wash over her. Her heart was thumping loudly, blood thrumming in her veins as Rio’s tongue flicked across her clit again and again.</p><p>Agatha had never felt this alive. Having someone on their knees for her. Worshipping her. This must be what it felt like to be a God she thought absentmindedly.</p><p>On the next roll of her hips Rio moaned into her cunt. Agatha pulled Rio’s hair back so she could look at her face.</p><p>As Rio leaned back into the touch Agatha took in the wetness coating Rio’s face, running down her chin. Her chest was heaving and as Agatha’s eyes trailed down further she did a double take. One of Rio’s hands was still wrapped around her thigh, the other was now buried in between her own thighs. Had Rio been touching herself this whole time?</p><p>“Is this— turning you on?” Agatha asked almost nervously.</p><p>Rio looked dumbfounded, “uh- yeah? Of course it is?” She let out a low chuckle “that okay with you?”</p><p>Agatha let out a small squeak as she nodded quickly.</p><p>“Okay good.” Rio said before diving back in. This time she took control. Using her hand on Agatha’s thighs to press her legs open further, she ducked her head down, licking up the wetness that had collected at her entrance before experimentally pushing her tongue inside.</p><p>“Oh fuck.” Agatha gasped, hand dropping to Rio’s shoulder to steady herself.</p><p>Rio pressed in deeper, building a steady rhythm, her nose gently nudging against Agatha’s clit with every bob of her head.</p><p>“Fuck Rio you feel so good.” Agatha moaned. “Just like that, fuck don’t stop.”</p><p>“Wanted this for so long, wanted you for so long.” Agatha babbled, eyes squeezed closed, lost in the feeling.</p><p>At that Rio moaned against her again, the noise sending delicious vibrations though her cunt.</p><p>She felt Rio’s tongue stutter inside of her, her face pressing forward into Agatha, the muscles in her shoulders twitching . Agatha’s eyes shot open as soon as she realized what was happening. Rio was coming. With her tongue deep inside of Agatha and her own hand buried inside of herself.</p><p>Holy fuck. If this was what sinning felt like, she never wanted to stop. “Rio.” She breathed out “did you just come?” She already knew the answer.</p><p>Rio looked up at her, cheeks flushed and thighs still trembling. “Sorry, I tried to stop it but…” she trailed off, giving a small shrug, “you’re well, you’re you. So, it makes it kind of hard.”</p><p>Agatha let out a breathless laugh, “don’t apologize, that was actually the hottest thing that’s ever happened to me.”</p><p>Rio grinned at that, the gap between her teeth on full display.</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Good.” Rio said, taking her fingers out from between her legs. They were slick and shiny as Rio brought them up to circle around Agatha’s nipples, leaning forward again to suck Agatha’s clit into her mouth.</p><p>Instead of the gentle licks and kisses she had been giving Agatha before she moved her mouth with more purpose, closing her lips around Agatha’s throbbing clit and swirling her tongue around it in quick shallow circles.</p><p>“Ooh- my— god.” She stuttered out. “Ri-ohhh” she gasped as Rio pinched her nipple between her still slick fingers.</p><p>Rio pulled Agatha’s thigh tightly over her shoulder, letting her lock her heel between her shoulder blades to keep herself balanced. Her tongue was moving faster now, flicking harshly against her clit each motion causing the pressure in Agatha’s stomach to coil tighter. She could feel her cunt pulsing as the euphoria started to spread through her.</p><p>“Rio I’m gonna c—”</p><p>Before she had a chance to finish Rio hollowed out her cheeks and sucked her clit harshly, the pressure inside of her finally snapped sending her careening over the edge.</p><p>White-hot pleasure shot through her, stars exploding behind her eyes as her thighs trembled and her knees gave out on her. She collapsed forward into Rio who caught her effortlessly, holding her pressed against the wall as she worked her through her orgasm.</p><p>As her clouded mind started to clear Agatha realized she was wrong. She wasn’t a God, Rio was.</p><p>Agatha Harkness had finally found a God worthy of her devotion.</p>

<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>In my mind Agatha has never known what love looks like outside of the devotion to a god, so the mention of devotion to Rio is about as close to a confession of love as she can get…but she’s working on it folks!</p></blockquote>
