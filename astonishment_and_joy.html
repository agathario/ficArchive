      Chapter 1: with little pride and less hope
  </h2>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>It was the winter of 1856, bitterly cold and unforgiving, when the newcomers arrived at the old homestead in Schoharie County.</p><p>There was ice in the bedroom for the first time all winter. Agatha noticed it on the sill as she stood at the window and tamed her hair into one long braid down her back. She preferred to leave it loose and wild, but there was no use for that these days — it would only get in the way. Her hands shook slightly with the cold as she scrubbed the potatoes, the water freezing on them as soon as they were washed. When she went out to check on the chickens, only one small egg lay in the hay. She set it carefully in the bowl, and feared Dyer’s response.</p><p>In the early afternoon she went to collect kindling on the hill, so concentrated on her task that she almost didn’t notice the horse and cart pull up at the dilapidated house in the valley below. The movement in her peripheral vision made her start — as a rule people didn’t pass through here. The landscape around her and Dyer’s homestead was barren and sprawling, scattered with small clusters of trees, but rarely signs of human life.</p><p>She bundled the sticks under her arm and used one hand to shield her face against the white sun, hidden behind a blanket of clouds. Below, a man dismounted from the cart, his movements brisk and careless. Behind him a woman, gathering her skirts to clamber down. The man did not offer her a hand, already beginning to sling bags and boxes from the back of the cart to the ground. He gestured to the boxes, and the woman nodded and picked one up, resting it on her hip.</p><p>She was too far away for Agatha to make out her features well, but her hair was striking — dark and loose, cascading down her back. Her skirts were unusual too, a shade of green Agatha had never seen in fabric before, verdant as fresh spring. The woman paused, breathing in the air deeply as though she rarely had opportunity to do so, surveying the surrounding hills. Agatha’s breath caught as her gaze drew nearer, and it seemed her eyes had alighted upon her. The woman gave a hesitant wave. Agatha paused, then slowly waved back. Though she could barely see her face, she thought the woman gave a curious smile.</p><p>Then the woman’s husband — he must surely be her husband — called, and she started and turned away as if burnt.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Back at home, Agatha was distracted. She sorted the firewood into piles to dry, finished her tasks about the barn, and began to prepare the food for dinner. Dyer was out in the fields with the sheep, and would be until evening. Usually this was a moment when she felt as close as she could feel to some kind of peace, her tasks complete, the rest of the day a blank slate until Dyer returned. Most days she took this moment to journal, seeking comfort in the possibility of the blank paper and ink. But as she sat down to do so her mind strayed to the woman with the dark hair and green skirt, who looked as though she had stepped out of another world. She would surely see her again, but when?</p><p>Her curiosity surprised her — she hadn’t felt so alive with a feeling in a long while. But then again, nothing new had happened in a long while either. Every day was the same: wake at dawn, make oatmeal for herself and Dyer, exchange a few words of monosyllabic conversation and then embark upon the practicalities of life. She had been visiting Nicholas’ grave, on the hill above the house, more rarely these days. She didn’t like to see it in winter — it was too much of a cruel reminder of the winter which had taken him from her. She had preferred to tend to it in the spring and summer, leaving sprigs of flowers on the headstone, sitting there for hours and telling him stories about flying horses and castles in the sky. Dyer thought it strange that she did this, and told her so, but for her talking to Nicholas was as normal as breathing.</p><p>She turned to a fresh page of her journal and dated it at the top. January 1st, 1856. “With little pride and less hope, we begin the new year,” she wrote. After a moment’s pause she dipped her pen into the ink bottle again and wrote below, as if as an afterthought, “Newcomers at the Zebrun farm.”</p><p>By the time Dyer returned that night, Agatha had imagined a hundred conversations with the woman; a hundred different ways that they might cross paths. She hadn’t had a friend in years, not since she was a child, and hadn’t much desired one either. But now she felt a keen yearning — for the company of somebody other than Dyer; for something to change.</p><p>She had to remind herself that for all she knew the woman and her husband could be awful, clueless city dwellers who thought they could handle the country and would soon be proven wrong. They’d figure out they couldn’t hack it and leave within weeks. Perhaps the woman would be mean, catty, like some of the women Agatha encountered at the market. Or perhaps she would be kind. Perhaps she could be a friend.</p><p>“We have new neighbours. They’re renting the Zebrun farm,” Dyer told her, sinking into his chair with a heavy sigh.</p><p>“Oh?” Agatha reached over to put a baked potato on his plate, her interest barely disguised.</p><p>“Arrived today. It’s a man, Finney, and his wife.”</p><p>“And what is the name of his wife?”</p><p>Dyer started eating, wearily, barely concentrating. “Something strange, a name I’d never heard before. Rio, I believe.”</p><p>“Will they be here long?”</p><p>“Yes, Finney said they’re wanting to get settled. Start a family. They’re young, but not so young.”</p><p>Dyer looked at Agatha pointedly as he said this, and she felt something heavy settle in her gut. She couldn’t bear it if this couple became yet another point of comparison for him; yet another reason for him to remind her that time was ticking, and there was only so long left before they would have to abandon the idea of another child. Agatha had let go of the idea long ago, not that she’d told Dyer that in so many words; had known at the very moment of Nicky’s death that there could never be anyone else for her. She had already been a mother to the most wonderful child she could have asked for. And yet Dyer persisted.</p><p>That night, after she blew out the candle and slipped into bed, facing away from him, he threw an arm around her waist and began to touch her. She closed her eyes, breathed out a small sigh, and allowed herself to dissociate a little. She was fortunate — Dyer was gentle, and his touch did not repel her, in fact in some way it made her feel safe. But she felt none of the heat he seemed to feel; none of the desire. She never had.</p><p>She knew what he was imagining as he slipped inside her — that this would be the moment that they created another child; this would be the second turning point of their life, their relationship, and everything would fall into place once again. Agatha felt herself float away from her body as he planted his hands on either side of her face, pulling her hair slightly, and knew that within a month the blood would come and there would be no child.</p><p>“Good night,” he murmured as he pulled out, leaving an uncomfortable sticky feeling behind, and an unpleasant ache between her legs — something not fully formed, and still unfulfilled. He kissed her forehead then collapsed onto his pillow, sated.</p><p>“Good night,” she replied, turning away once again.</p><p>Behind her closed eyelids danced visions of dark hair stirring in the wind, fresh spring green and a hesitant wave. For the first time in months, she yearned for the day to come.</p>

<p>Chapter Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>‘Researching’ this chapter led to me discovering that azaleas originated in Asia and only made their way to the US around the 1830s. You learn something new every day!</p><p>I feel like Agatha in this fic might be a little bit OC, but I think that her shyness makes sense in that I am imagining both her and Rio in their late 20s, so it hasn’t been long since she escaped her mother’s influence and now she’s under that of her husband. Period-typical shyness I guess? I’m sure she will find her confidence…</p><p>There are a few direct quotes from the film worked in here, and there will be throughout.</p></blockquote>

<p>The next day was fair and clear. Nicky’s birthday. The blue sky seemed to herald it. Agatha was sweeping the porch when she heard a rustling, and looked up to see a large black dog hurtling towards her. Behind it followed the woman with the green skirts. Agatha could see now that it was in fact a dress, with a fitted bodice and low neckline. She dragged her eyes up to meet those of the woman and, curiously, felt her heart skip a beat. The woman was truly unusual looking, with olive-toned skin and wide brown eyes. When she smiled, it seemed to light up her entire face. Agatha noticed she had a small gap in her teeth.</p><p>“Good afternoon,” the woman said. “I’m sorry about my dog. She likes to get ahead of me.”</p><p>“Good afternoon,” Agatha managed, feeling strangely flushed and nervous.</p><p>“I thought I would come and introduce myself,” the woman said, squinting slightly against the sun. “I’m Rio. My husband and I arrived at the Zebrun farm yesterday. I believe I saw you up on the hill.”</p><p>“Yes. I was collecting firewood.” Agatha’s voice felt strange coming out of her own mouth. She couldn’t comprehend why Rio was making her so nervous. Her gaze was firm and steady, warm. There was nothing unkind about her. But for some reason Agatha felt as though she wanted to run. Rio seemed to sense this.</p><p>“I hope I’m not intruding?”</p><p>“Oh, no,” Agatha managed.</p><p>“I just needed to get away for the day,” Rio explained. She seemed to be taking Agatha in too, absorbing, probably, the frayed hem of her dress and cuffs of her sleeves, and the darned patches at her elbows. “The farm is a slaughterhouse right now. My husband is killing his hogs.” She made a face.</p><p>“Would you like to come in?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Yes, I’d love that,” Rio smiled. They stood there for a minute, neither moving, the dog sniffing around Agatha’s feet. “Or we could just stay out on the porch shivering,” Rio joked. There was a twinkle in her eye, and Agatha noticed she had a dimple in her right cheek when she smiled. It seemed to her that she had never in her life encountered someone who embodied ease and joy in the way that Rio did.</p><p>Agatha turned and walked into the house, Rio and the dog following. “Does she have a name, your dog?” she asked.</p><p>“She’s called Azalea.”</p><p>“Azalea?” The word felt foreign in her mouth.</p><p>“It’s a kind of flower. I saw an illustration of it in an encyclopedia once, a long time ago. It’s pretty, but I suppose more than anything I just liked the sound of the word.”</p><p>Agatha set some water to boil, noticing Rio’s flushed cheeks and pink nose. “It is an interesting word. Are you cold?”</p><p>“A little.”</p><p>“The tea should warm you. And I could light a fire.” Agatha sat, and motioned for Rio to do the same. For a moment they just stared at one another, and then Rio looked away and laughed softly, as though she were privy to some secret that Agatha did not yet know. Agatha noticed the silkiness of her hair, the gentle underflush of her skin. It so disconcerted her that she had to look away.</p><p>“I like your hair,” Rio said, as though she could read her mind. “It’s very long.”</p><p>“I’ve always been vain about it,” Agatha admitted. “Ever since I was a child. When I was ten years old I grew it down to my waist, and since then I’ve rarely cut it. It was the bane of my mother’s life. She used to chase me with scissors.”</p><p>“It’s beautiful. I would like to see it loose.”</p><p>Agatha blushed. “Not much use for loose hair around here, what with the harsh wind and the dirt.”</p><p>“No, I suppose not.”</p><p>They fell silent.</p><p>“I hope I’m not keeping you from something,” Rio said. She seemed to be pressing against Agatha’s limits, testing the boundaries of her quietness. Perhaps trying to understand if she was genuinely unwelcome.</p><p>“No,” Agatha said. “I’m glad you’ve come.”</p><p>They passed what must have been hours there at the kitchen table, a few feet away from each other, Agatha occasionally rising to refill their mugs of tea, steadfastly ignoring thoughts of the chores she should have been completing. She was learning a lot about Rio. She was the last surviving of four siblings and her parents died when she was young, causing her to be nicknamed ‘Lady Death’ by childhood bullies because of the way everyone around her seemed to meet an untimely end. Rio told this story wryly, chuckling, but Agatha saw a flicker of pain in her eyes.</p><p>“That’s why Finney and I married very young,” Rio explained. “I had nobody. And he’d pursued me since we were children, practically.”</p><p>“Childhood sweethearts,” Agatha remarked, then realised it sounded a little bitter.</p><p>“Something like that.” Rio looked wistful. “We’re at each other’s throats a lot, to be honest — always have been. He’s contrary. Doesn’t like me to have too many of my own opinions, or to express them, but doesn’t like me too quiet either. I find it hard to tread the line of his moods. My father was like that too.”</p><p>“Dyer is never openly angry with me,” Agatha found herself saying. “But he is so constantly miserable. The world is a burden to him. He told me recently that contentment is like a friend he never gets to see.”</p><p>“My mother always said that having children would resolve these dilemmas,” Rio mused. “But look at us.” She gestured to the space around them, as if to allude to its childlessness.</p><p>Agatha took a breath, deciding whether she should say it, and bear whatever Rio’s response would be. She decided to do so. “My son Nicky would have been five today.”</p><p>“Oh.” A look of gentle sympathy crossed Rio’s face. Agatha found herself leaning towards her, trying to soak it in. She could never talk about Nicky — Dyer did not want to hear it. “How did he pass?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Diphtheria. Last November.”</p><p>There was a bang outside and both women jumped, as if caught doing something they shouldn’t, rather than simply sitting by the fire. The door swung upon and Dyer burst into the kitchen.</p><p>“Rio. Good evening.”</p><p>“Good evening.”</p><p>Was it really evening? Time had seemed to stand still as they talked, but now Agatha looked out of the window and noticed that the sun was dipping behind the hill and dusk was falling.</p><p>“I should be going,” Rio said.</p><p>“Of course.” Agatha helped her into her wrap, which she had taken off when they had moved closer to the fire. It was soft, and as she draped the fabric around Rio’s shoulders she caught the scent of lavender and rosemary that clung to it. Agatha hadn’t worn perfume in years. Smelling it now reminded her of youth; of a sense of possibility.</p><p>“I'm so glad you’ve come,” she said to Rio as she led her out onto the porch. “Meeting you has made my day.”</p><p>“It has?” Rio leaned a little closer to her, conspiratorially. “Well, how pleasant and uncommon it is to make someone’s day.”</p>

<p>Over the following weeks, Rio seemed to find any opportunity to escape her own home and pay visits to Agatha. They were so industrious together that their husbands could not find reason to object — hours of folding laundry and housework flew by either in companionable silence or with animated conversation. If Finney felt the absence of his wife at home, he didn’t mention it to Dyer in the rare instances they crossed paths.</p><p>Rio was sweet, calm and gracious, and yet her spirits seemed to quicken at the prospect of further conversation with Agatha. She always took a moment to warm up when she arrived, as though she doubted whether she would be welcome, but with time Agatha could sense her becoming more comfortable. When Rio came out of her shell, everything she said was so sharp and incisive that Agatha began to suspect that the other woman could read her mind.</p><p>One afternoon, when Dyer’s slaughtered chickens were lying across the kitchen table and the women were up to their elbows in feathers, Rio asked Agatha about her and Dyer’s courtship.</p><p>“It was quite short, I suppose,” Agatha mused. “I lived with my mother, just the two of us, and I was so desperate to get away from her that when the time came and he proposed I jumped at the chance.”</p><p>“I bet he was smitten with you,” Rio teased, looking up from her task for a short moment.</p><p>“I believe he admired my good sense, and my practicality,” Agatha replied briskly.</p><p>“So your good sense, that’s all your husband was smitten with?” Rio said. The teasing tone was still there, but there was something more, something daring. She put down her handful of feathers and turned to lean back against the edge of the table.</p><p>“I suppose that as a suitor he was not generous but he was just, and he was affectionate if not constant.” Agatha realised that this was not an answer to the question, but she didn’t completely understand what Rio was asking.</p><p>“I mean, Agatha, that surely you know you have many remarkable qualities besides your good sense,” Rio said gently.</p><p>Agatha blushed. “I don’t know about that.”</p><p>“Tell me what else you think your husband liked about you,” Rio said.</p><p>Agatha laid down her task and leaned against the table next to Rio, their manual labour all but forgotten. The position was good because it meant that she didn’t have to look into Rio’s eyes, which seemed to her like a pool one could drown in. “He probably liked that I didn’t have any interest in anyone else,” she said eventually. “He liked that I am shy, and solitary.”</p><p>“I don’t believe you are shy,” Rio said. “You’re a great many things, but you’re not shy.”</p><p>“What am I, then?” Agatha asked. She felt a surge of bravery within her. Her hand, resting on the table between her and Rio, edged a little closer to Rio’s, as though it had a mind of its own. Their fingers brushed.</p><p>“I think you’re incredibly intelligent,” Rio said. Her eyes were firmly fixed on the fireplace in front of them, where the fire was dying down to smouldering embers. “I think you’re kind and generous and caring, but you hold a lot of that back, within yourself. I am very grateful that you extend your kindness and care to me.”</p><p>“Of course,” Agatha murmured.</p><p>“And I think you’re beautiful,” Rio said. Agatha dared to look at her then. Their eyes met, and Agatha saw something in Rio’s that she’d never seen there before. Rio’s fingers slowly intertwined with hers and she lifted their hands together, both dry and calloused, but warm. Rio opened her mouth to say something else, but at that moment the porch creaked and they sprang apart, both quickly returning to their abandoned task.</p><p>They greeted Dyer as he came into the kitchen, snow dusting the shoulders of his jacket, keeping their voices light, but Agatha could see a flush spreading across Rio’s cheeks and down her neck, disappearing into the deep neckline of her dress.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>And then Rio and Finney invited Agatha and Dyer to dinner.</p><p>Agatha was sure that it had been Finney’s idea — there was no reason for the two of them to see each other with their husbands when they could just as easily spend time alone. She felt a flutter of nerves as she got ready for the evening, splashing her face with cold water to calm herself. She carefully took her hair out of its usual braid and tousled it a little, marvelling at how long it had grown, almost down to her waist. She exchanged her everyday dress for a deep purple one that Rio had never seen before, that cinched around her waist and emphasised her curves. She only wore it for special occasions and there had been a distinct lack of those recently, so it smelled vaguely musty, but it was in good condition, and her favourite colour. Nicky had always liked it, too.</p><p>Dyer watched her from the doorway as she smoothed the dress down in the mirror, saying nothing.</p><p>“Are you ready to go?” she asked him.</p><p>He grunted an affirmative, already striding for the door.</p><p>“I hope Finney remembers you have a husband,” he said drily. It took Agatha a long second to recognise the comment as a compliment.</p><p>The effort she had made felt worth it as soon as Finney opened the door, Rio a few paces behind him. Rio’s eyes widened almost comically as she looked Agatha up and down, and then she remembered herself.</p><p>“Good evening Dyer, Agatha,” she said. “It’s good of you to come.”</p><p>The men immediately installed themselves by the fire to talk farm, and Agatha made herself busy in the kitchen, collecting plates to carry through to the other room. Rio reached out as she turned to leave, her hand catching her waist.</p><p>“Did you miss me?” she asked in a low voice.</p><p>Agatha glanced at the door, ensuring they weren’t visible. She felt the need to keep this moment with Rio to herself. “Yes.”</p><p>“Good,” Rio said. Her voice was unusually husky, and Agatha caught, with some surprise, a hint of alcohol on her breath.</p><p>“Have you been drinking, Rio?”</p><p>“Just a little. Finney’s wine. He’ll pour you a glass, I’m sure.”</p><p>Agatha realised just how close they were standing, close enough to share breaths, Rio’s hand still on her waist. “Finney seems agreeable,” she said.</p><p>“He is when he chooses to be.”</p><p>Their eyes met and Rio flushed deep red, as Agatha was coming to realise was her predisposition, laughed softly and looked away.</p><p>Settled around the table with the men the two women communicated almost monosyllabically, with disingenuous remarks. They were playing the part of neighbourly acquaintances, Agatha realised, when they had already, so quickly, gone so far beyond that. They had nothing to say to each other like this. She sipped Finney’s wine and felt its warmth spread through her, the ghost of Rio’s firm hold on her waist lingering.</p><p>Later that night, back at their homestead and Dyer in bed, Agatha opened the ledger to write down the day’s purchases at the market. This complete, she retrieved her own journal from its place at the very back of a cupboard Dyer never looked into, and turned it to a fresh page.</p><p>February 14th, 1856. “Dinner at Finney and Rio’s. Another bitterly cold night,” Agatha wrote. She paused, then added, “There is something going on between us that I cannot unravel.”</p><p>She stared at the words for the moment, as though their existence on the page somehow made them more true than they had been when they were inside her head. Then she drew three black lines through the sentence, the ink exploding from the pen nib to render it entirely illegible.</p>

<p>
<span>February 23rd was Agatha’s birthday.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The weather was appropriately ominous — dark clouds forming overhead, birds scattering to each gust of wind. Dyer was already outside when she woke, tying things down with rope in preparation for a potential storm. She knew that she should go out and help him, but she felt frozen, her limbs heavy against the sheets. Today was her second birthday without Nicky; the second birthday when she had not been woken by small arms around her neck and soft kisses. She felt empty from the lack of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had come by a few times since the dinner, but Dyer had been more present than usual, coming in and out of the kitchen constantly without warning, so conversation between the two of them had been minimal. Agatha woke every morning aching for Rio’s company; for her warm smile and her trusting gaze, her eyes steadily willing Agatha to drop her guard.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had wondered whether Rio would be embarrassed by how candid she had been, first in Agatha’s kitchen over the chicken feathers and then in the seclusion of her own kitchen at dinner, but she showed no sign of it. She must be more accustomed to friendship than I am, Agatha had realised with an envious pang. These compliments and gentle touches must be commonplace to her, rather than a shock to the system as they were for Agatha. The thought of that — that to Rio this might be just another neighbourly friendship — made Agatha feel sick. Because it seemed to be becoming Agatha’s whole world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio and Finney had first arrived at the farm she had been so deep in misery that she would have latched on to anything, probably, she realised. Did Rio feel like she had latched onto her? Did she see her as needy, an inconvenience? Agatha felt herself spiralling a little, as she always seemed to when she hadn’t seen Rio for a few days, growing unmoored and uncertain. She forced herself to get up and dress.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re awake,” Dyer said as he entered the kitchen, not bothering to take off his boots and treading in tracks of mud and melted snow. “It looks like there’s going to be a snowstorm. I’d best head to the Zebrun farm right away, to help Finney with their livestock. I’ll send Rio to help you with your tasks here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright,” Agatha said, her pulse quickening at the idea of Rio being here while their husbands laboured elsewhere. Dyer looked almost excited, too. He seemed to enjoy storms, battening down the hatches against the world outside so that it couldn’t touch them. It suited his reclusive disposition. Sometimes the two of them would go days without leaving the confines of the house, if the storm was really bad. It always made Agatha crazy, claustrophobic, and at the first sign of it letting up she’d throw open all of the windows, much to Dyer’s irritation.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll see you later,” Dyer said, donning a second jacket.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“See you later.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was only once he’d left and closed the door behind him that Agatha realised he had not wished her a happy birthday.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>An hour later Rio arrived  — preceded by Azalea, as always, who bounded across the field towards the house with great excitement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t help herself. She rushed out onto the porch and once Rio had climbed the steps she threw her arms around the other woman, holding her tightly and breathing in her distinctive lavender rosemary scent. Rio held her tightly back, and they swayed a little.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You really missed me this time,” Rio teased, her voice muffled in Agatha’s neck. Her breath tickled and Agatha gave a little involuntary shiver. “Happy birthday, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha drew back. “You remembered?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked affronted. “Of course I remembered.” She brandished the basket she was holding, covered in a cloth, which Agatha hadn’t even noticed in her elation. Azalea jumped up onto her hind legs, trying to catch it, and the two of them laughed. “I brought you gifts,” Rio said. “Let’s go inside?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha closed the door behind them she felt the chill of the oncoming snowstorm and registered the fact that all signs of animal life had disappeared from their surroundings. But she felt none of the dread she usually did, because when she turned Rio was beaming at her, unloading her basket onto the table. Her hair was windblown and tangled but she didn’t seem to have noticed, or simply didn’t care.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I brought you eggs, because I know you haven’t had any recently.” Rio’s childlike enthusiasm was infectious. “And honey.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aren’t you supposed to let me discover for myself what my gifts are?” Agatha teased.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh. Yes. Sorry.” Rio seemed genuinely apologetic, like a kicked puppy, and Agatha didn’t like how the excitement had died in her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, no, Rio, I didn’t mean it. Thank you so much. It’s so kind of you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s something else too,” Rio said, handing her something rectangular and heavy, covered in cloth.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha unwrapped it slowly and her eyes widened. “You brought me an atlas?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked shy. “You said you’d wanted one for a while.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>This was an understatement. One afternoon over the laundry Agatha had spent about an hour waxing lyrical about her desire for an atlas, and her lack of her own money to spend on one. “My self-education seems the only way to keep my unhappiness from overwhelming me,” she had said to Rio, and Rio had nodded in understanding.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, it’s perfect. I don’t know what to say.” Agatha stroked the pages reverentially, following the cartographer’s lines and tracing the illustrations. She really was speechless, both about Rio’s remembering, and the trouble she had surely gone to to save up for and source the gift.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t have to say anything,” Rio replied. “But I want you to tell me everything that you learn from it. All of the secrets of this far-reaching country.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can we sit by the fire? My feet are freezing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let me warm them?” She noticed that Rio had taken off her boots at the door out of respect for Agatha’s clean floor, not that it made a huge amount of difference now that Dyer had tracked mud everywhere.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Once Rio was settled into the chair Agatha knelt by her feet and took one of them in her hand, massaging it between her fingers. Rio gave a small, blissed-out sigh, watching her. As Agatha moved her fingers higher, to the arch of her foot, she seemed to melt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m somewhat surprised that Finney let you come here today,” Agatha said. “I’d have thought he’d want you home to prepare for the storm.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll have to go back soon, before it gets dark,” Rio said. She paused. “He uses a ledger to keep account of who I visit and how long I stay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s fingers found a particularly tense spot in her arch and Rio stiffened and removed her foot from Agatha’s grasp.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It tickles,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Feeling chastised, Agatha went and sat in her chair. A sense of distance had come between them suddenly, at the mention of Finney. She had mentioned him only because she wanted to better understand their relationship, but understanding continued to elude her. Rio often made allusions to his cruelty to animals and to trespassers on the farm, but not to her, although Agatha found it hard to believe that if he could be so spiteful to vulnerable creatures it would not extend to his wife. She knew that he exercised control over her, held her on a leash and reeled her in and out. It wasn’t that Rio could not stand up for herself, and Agatha knew that she did, but as women there was only so much power they held.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The air had soured, and Agatha decided to change the subject. “Nicky and I always used to make something sweet, on my birthday. He loved helping me cook.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled again, her defences falling away. “He sounds very special.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He is. He was,” Agatha corrected herself. “He always wanted to help me with everything I was doing. Sometimes he couldn’t, because he was too little or too young, and I’d have to make up some pretend task to occupy him. Whatever it was, he’d be so concentrated, determined to do it to the best of his ability.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What did he look like?” Rio asked. She leaned back, as if she had all the time in the world. Agatha realised that perhaps this was Rio’s final birthday gift to her: listening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He was very handsome. He didn’t look much like me though, or Dyer — I don’t know where he came from. Heaven, maybe. He had these big brown eyes and a wide smile. He was very athletic, always running around, always chattering.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded her encouragement, but Agatha felt a lump rising in her throat and knew she couldn’t continue. “On the night he died,” she said, “he put his arms around me and said nothing else, but it felt like we were speaking.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt tears well, emotion rising in her, and her hands shook. When she looked up at Rio she was in a similar state.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You loved each other so much,” Rio said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dyer must want another child.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t respond, just swallowed her tears and stared into Rio’s eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I understand,” Rio said softly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A sudden darkness fell over the room, as though someone had blown out a candle. The two women looked out of the window to see the sky blanketed by black clouds. Agatha went to the door and opened it to see snow already falling fast. There was a faint groaning in the north east, like a locomotive.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio came up and stood beside her in the doorway. Before their eyes, the snow began to fall even more rapidly, until the horizon disappeared and the ground even a few feet before them receded into invisibility. Behind them Azalea whined, a long, distressed sound, and Rio shuddered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, I think it’s too late for me to leave.”</span>

<p>
<span>“Agatha, I think it’s too late for me to leave,” Rio said. As she spoke a great gust of wind whipped snow in their direction and Agatha stumbled from the force of it. “Let’s go back inside.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Even with the door firmly closed the sound of the storm was deafening. It was dark as night inside the house, although it was only late afternoon.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt anxiety rise within her. “What about Dyer?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dyer was with Finney when I left. I can’t imagine that they would have finished everything they needed to do in so short a time. I’m sure he’s still there, safe. Don’t worry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He may not be able to leave for some time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, look outside. He certainly won’t be able to leave tonight. This’ll go on for hours.” Rio’s tone was soothing, but she spoke with finality. “Are your animals safely enclosed? Do they need anything?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I took care of them while I was waiting for you to arrive. They’ll be fine for the night.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then all we can do is wait it out,” Rio said. She took in Agatha’s concern, the way she was biting at her bottom lip nervously. “Am I so bad of a companion?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, it’s not that. I just worry for Dyer. He’s so…” Agatha couldn’t find the words to express her husband’s objection to spending long periods of time with other people without outright insulting him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Finney’s not exactly the most talkative either. They’ll be fine, Agatha. They’re grown men.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I suppose so.” Agatha realised she was being foolish, and that Rio probably thought her so. “I’ll make you tea and honey,” she said. “Sit down.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yessir,” Rio said, and perched on the edge of the kitchen table. Agatha liked how often she did that — her obvious irreverence for convention. She busied herself with the water and the tea leaves, feeling the steam and the familiar aroma soothe her senses. She didn’t know what she was so afraid of; why there was a ball of anxiety churning in the pit of her stomach. It was just Rio, Rio who she knew so well now. She was not, as she’d said, so bad of a companion. But when she turned around with the mugs of tea, she found Rio watching her with such open and breathless awe that her heart almost stopped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What is it?” Agatha asked foolishly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio seemed to consider her next sentence carefully. Her chest was rising and falling sharply, as though she had been running. “Every morning I wake up and I think that I never want to be far from you,” she said finally. “And under your influence, since you’re so good with words, I’ve composed a poem. It’s entitled ‘Oh, Sick and Miserable Heart, Be Still.’”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“When I was a little girl,” Agatha said, not knowing quite where her sentence was taking her, only knowing that she needed a little more time to figure out the intended meaning behind Rio’s words, “I thought I could cultivate my intellect and do something for the world. But my life has surprised me by being far more ordinary.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You're talking about that moment that I have dreamed about,” Rio said, “when we’re carried in triumph for having done something wonderful, or received at home with tears and shouts of joy. Do you know what I wonder?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, stepping into Rio’s space. She placed the tea carefully on the table beside her, not trusting her shaking hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is it possible,” Rio continued, “that such a moment hasn’t yet come for either of us?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think it has,” Agatha said, with certainty, and then more cautiously, “Or that it could.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You do,” Rio said, almost disbelievingly. “So what do you think? What do you think about us?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know how to put it into words.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, try.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have tried.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, try again. What do you imagine?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I imagine,” Agatha began, willing the words to come to her, “that our encircling feelings leave nothing out, for us to want or seek.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had been aiming to say something vague enough for Rio to be able to misunderstand her should she choose to, but by the dazed expression on Rio’s face she had not succeeded in that. Agatha felt that familiar churning anxiety rising within her — fear of rejection, panic that what she had just admitted to would scare Rio so much that she would leave immediately, snowstorm be damned. When Rio didn’t reply for a beat too long, she felt the need to claw the words back. “I've presumed too much,” she said quietly, stepping backwards, but Rio caught her wrist and pulled her so much closer that she stumbled into her, their lips almost touching.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s been my experience,” Rio murmured, her breath fanning hot across Agatha’s lips, “that it’s not always those who show the least who actually feel the least.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes flickered down to Agatha’s lips and back up again, searching for confirmation. When Agatha did not pull away she leaned closer and their lips brushed, not a kiss, just a light touch. And then Rio retreated. This time it was Agatha who tugged her back in.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why didn’t you do what you attempted to do?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio just shook her head in response, giving one of her little smiles and looking away, as if the idea of what she had been about to do were so ridiculous that she could no longer countenance it. But Agatha was filled with sudden determination and bravery. They had come this far already — they had been this honest. What, exactly, did they have left to lose? She leaned forward and captured Rio’s lips with her own.</span>
</p><p>
<span>To her shock, Rio reciprocated with enthusiasm immediately, pulling her in by her waist and reaching up to cradle the back of her head, as though she were something precious. Agatha felt a thrill spread through her entire body from where their lips touched, over and over, down to her toes, centring between her legs. Rio kissed as though she wanted to devour her, opening her mouth and tracing Agatha’s upper lip with her tongue, nipping at her lower lip teasingly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The air around them was filled with sighs and soft whimpers, the storm wailing outside and making the windows creak. Rio pulled her impossibly closer, their chests pressed against each other, and then — Agatha could scarcely believe it — pushed her thigh in between Agatha’s legs. At the first contact Agatha let out a low moan, and she felt Rio smile against her lips and press harder, making Agatha shudder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When she pulled back, Rio was looking at her as though she had hung the moon and the stars.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve wanted to do that for weeks,” she admitted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How did you know you wanted to?” Agatha asked, catching her breath. She rested her forehead against Rio’s, breathing in the smell of her. She felt pure relief washing over her, lapping at the sand of her anxiety and smoothing it over.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know, Agatha, how does one know one wants anything? One day I just knew I wanted you, and then it felt as though I’d known that forever.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Azalea shifted on the floor, her claws scratching the wood, and the two women jumped, then laughed at their own panic.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve wanted you too,” Agatha confessed. “I didn’t know how to explain what it was. I only know that whenever we’re apart I yearn for you as though you are a missing part of me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And what does it feel like, now that you have me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed softly at Rio’s insistence that she always put things into words. She thought for a moment as Rio looked at her expectantly. “Astonishment and joy,” she said, finally. “Astonishment and joy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned in and kissed her again, and again, as if she couldn’t believe that she could. Her thigh remained between Agatha’s legs, and Agatha felt herself grow impatient, reduced to burning want centring at that point of pressure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” she said. “Will you take me to bed?”</span>

<p>Undressing for Rio was entirely unlike undressing for Dyer.</p><p>For a start, Rio knew how to help her, effortlessly unfastening the intricate buttons on the back of her dress which she struggled with alone each morning and lifting it over her head gently, making sure her hair didn’t get caught. Afterwards she set about unfastening Agatha’s corset. Here she struggled more, frustrated (Agatha was tempted to quip, “More haste, less speed,” as she had often told Nicky when he was rushing something, but she held her tongue). Eventually Rio managed to loosen it and tug it off, laying it across the back of the chair. Everything she did was careful, but her movements were hungry too, as if she couldn’t get to Agatha fast enough. She paused before lifting Agatha’s petticoat over her head, silently checking in. Agatha nodded, and then Rio slid her hands up her sides and pulled it off, leaving her in only her drawers, her breasts bare to the chill air.</p><p>And there was another stark difference between this and her interminable nights with Dyer: Rio looked at her with utter reverence, as though she were about to fall to her knees and worship her.</p><p>“Oh god,” Rio murmured. “You are so <em>pretty</em>.”</p><p>The innocence in her tone made Agatha blush, as though she was a teenager all over again. She felt vaguely feverish and knew that she was flushed all over, her nipples pebbled against the cold air. “You can touch,” she said. And Rio did, immediately, her hands flying to Agatha’s breasts to cup them, rubbing her thumbs over her nipples, and then sliding down her side to the waistband of her drawers.</p><p>“We should light a candle,” Rio said. “I want to see you, properly.”</p><p>It was true that it was almost pitch dark in the bedroom, dusk having fallen. The wind wailed outside. Rio struck a match, the flare of light illuminating her perfect profile in its flickering orange glow. The candle beside the bed lit, she turned back to Agatha.</p><p>“Lie down,” she told her. Agatha, without a second thought, did as she was told.</p><p>Rio removed her own dress and corset quickly, like a woman possessed, and clambered on top of Agatha, who lay prone on the bed, waiting to see what she would do. She was all over her again immediately, kissing her face, her neck, the swell of her breasts. Agatha felt herself growing wetter between her legs, a curious sensation that she hadn’t felt for a long time, not since the last time she had pleasured herself with her own hand months ago. Alone it took a while to reach anything close to this state, concentrated labour with tightly closed eyes and a furrowed brow. Rio had reduced her to a soaked, desperate mess the moment she had laid a hand on her.</p><p>Rio’s body was firm and lithe against her, her hips pinning her against the mattress. When Agatha traced her hand down Rio’s side she felt tight muscle and the sharp, jutting bone of her hip.</p><p>“I’m going to take these off,” Rio said, her fingers dipping into the waistband of Agatha’s undergarments. Agatha nodded. As Rio began to slide them down her thighs Agatha realised just how wet she was — the fabric stuck to her cunt and had to be pried away. Rio’s mouth fell wide open at the sight, her hands stroking over Agatha’s belly and around her hips to thumb at the divots there.</p><p>Agatha felt a flicker of self-consciousness about her soft belly, already fairly certain that Rio’s did not look like that. “My body isn’t…” She trailed off when she saw Rio’s challenging look. “I didn’t look like this when I was younger, before I gave birth. My body is so different now.”</p><p>“Of course it is,” Rio said simply. “It carried your wonderful son.” She leaned down to press a kiss against the subtle rounding of Agatha’s lower belly, her hair falling softly and tickling her there. “I don’t want the Agatha from back then. I don’t know her. I want the Agatha I know now.”</p><p>She kissed Agatha deeply and soundly then, and Agatha felt her hand snake down between their bodies, her own entirely naked, Rio’s still partially clothed in smooth cotton that was becoming damper the longer their ministrations continued.</p><p>Trailing her fingertips through the damp curls between Agatha’s legs, Rio immediately found her destination, no direction required. She pressed the calloused pad of her thumb to the swollen bud and experimentally circled it. The loud whimper which Agatha let out surprised both of them, and she found herself reaching down to hold Rio’s wrist, scared she would move away. Emboldened, Rio’s thumb circled again and again, and Agatha felt more wetness pooling between her legs and dripping down onto the sheets, her cunt clenching around nothing.</p><p>Rio dipped her thumb down into it and hummed with satisfaction, then brought it back up, wet now, to return to those tight, firm circles, speeding up slightly.</p><p>Agatha realised that Rio was looking down at her own hand working between Agatha’s legs, utterly entranced, and the idea that she was so fascinated by what they were doing made Agatha’s vision become unfocused. She closed her eyes tightly, then felt Rio’s open lips on her neck, alternating between kissing and sucking and tiny bites. She knew she was being loud, all sighs and whimpers and broken moans, but she couldn’t stop herself if she tried.</p><p>“Can I try something?” Rio murmured into her ear. She sounded wrecked, her voice husky and trembling.</p><p>Agatha managed a hoarse “Yes,” and seconds later she felt Rio’s fingertips sliding through her soaked folds, her thumb still firm on her clit. “Oh,” she heard herself say.</p><p>“Yes?” Rio put a little pressure on her fingers, and Agatha felt none of the resistance she usually did at the prospect of penetration.</p><p>“Yes,” she sighed as two of Rio’s fingers slipped inside her, and then in one swift movement Rio bent her head and took Agatha’s nipple in her open mouth. The wet heat of it and the feeling of fullness released something Agatha barely had time to realise was building, and she felt her whole body seize up, clenching hard around the fingers inside her. A wave of pleasure washed through her, travelling through all of her limbs, and she felt it collect between her legs in a hot, wet rush, spilling over.</p><p>“Oh, Agatha,” she distantly heard Rio murmur, wonder in her voice. Then she felt the weight of her whole body cover her, holding her through the aftershocks, pressing gentle kisses to her shoulder.</p><p>It took Agatha several minutes to come back to reality, and when she did the world felt softer than normal, blurred at the edges. She breathed in the scent of Rio’s hair, warm lavender rosemary and something sweet which was uniquely her.</p><p>“That’s never happened before,” Agatha managed, her voice hoarse. “Only when I’ve been alone.”</p><p>Rio hummed softly, burrowing further into her neck. “It happened fast,” she remarked, teasingly.</p><p>A little embarrassed, Agatha laughed and swatted at her, and they tumbled around for a moment, flushed and sweaty, thighs damp with Agatha’s release and Rio’s unfulfilled desire. When they came to a pause they stared at each other, breathless.</p><p>“You were so beautiful, when you climaxed,” Rio said a little shyly, the word sounding foreign in her mouth. Agatha wondered if she’d ever said it before. “You <em> are </em> so beautiful.”</p><p>“You’re flattering me.”</p><p>“Yes, I am. But it’s the truth. I only ever tell you the truth.”</p><p>Rio could look so earnest when she wanted to, it made Agatha feel guilty for teasing.</p><p>“I know,” she said. She leaned over to press a soft kiss to Rio’s lips, then pushed her gently onto her back. She looked down at the vision beneath her, Rio’s dark hair spread over the pillow, her pupils entirely blown, her chest rising and falling. Unable to wait any longer, she tugged Rio’s undergarments off, flinging them to the floor somewhere.</p><p>Her ribs were prominent, her nipples hard and dusky. Agatha couldn’t resist rubbing her thumb over one, then took the other in between her lips, sucking gently.</p><p>“Oh, fuck,” Rio said. “<em>Agatha</em>.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“They’re sensitive.”</p><p>Agatha smirked and kept sucking, pinching the other nipple and rolling it between her fingertips.</p><p>Rio groaned. “You’re going to ruin me and you haven’t even…”</p><p>Agatha pulled back, grinning with newfound confidence, and the realisation that she <em> loved </em> this. There had been nothing to be nervous about. “Perhaps you’ll fall apart even faster than I did,” she said. She gave one final lick over Rio’s nipple and then left it, hard and glistening with saliva, to kiss down her stomach, tracing her fingers over her ribcage. Her lips met downy hair beneath Rio’s belly button, which trailed into darker curls, completely soaked with arousal. When Agatha looked up, Rio was watching her with utter fascination, propped up on her elbows.</p><p>“You like to watch me, don’t you?” Agatha asked.</p><p>Rio nodded breathlessly. “You’re a vision. What are you going to do to me?”</p><p>In lieu of an answer Agatha pushed Rio’s legs apart and spread her folds with two fingers. She thought she’d never seen anything so beautiful in her life, Rio opened up for her, dripping onto the sheets. She smelt like the earth after rain, like the needles of pine trees. It struck her how natural and easy this all felt, even though she had done none of it before.</p><p>She leaned in and dragged her tongue experimentally through the wetness and Rio cried out, grabbing a handful of Agatha’s hair. Agatha moaned.</p><p>“Yes,” she murmured. “Show me where you want me.”</p><p>The hands in her hair tightened and pulled her harder against Rio’s cunt, which she licked deeper into like a woman starved. Rio was loud — Agatha could hear her even with her thighs tightening around her ears. She took what she wanted, too, rolling her hips into Agatha’s mouth faster and faster, moaning brazenly.</p><p>Agatha’s own hips shifted against the sheets and she realised with shock that she was close again too, on the brink from Rio’s moans and the heady taste of her arousal. She rocked against the mattress as she licked at Rio, trying not to lose focus.</p><p>“I’m going to…” Agatha heard Rio say, and then she <em>felt </em> Rio’s climax on her tongue. It seemed to last forever, an endless loop, small gushes of liquid falling onto her tongue. She swallowed all of it gratefully, her own climax washing over her as she did so.</p><p>When it seemed that Rio was finished Agatha lay her cheek on the inside of her thigh and breathed deeply. Rio’s hand, shaking slightly, stroked over her doubtless wild hair soothingly, lulling Agatha almost to sleep.</p><p>“I didn’t know I could feel like that,” Rio sighed eventually. “I think you might be magic.”</p><p>From where Agatha’s head lay she could see the mess she’d left behind, Rio’s thighs soaked, her clit swollen and pulsing. It made her want to return to where she’d been and never leave.</p><p>And then Rio used her grip on Agatha’s hair to tilt her head up to look at her, smiled, and said, “I want to be inside you again.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>The first thing Agatha noticed when she awoke the next morning was how sore she was. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The second was the arm slung loosely around her waist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And the third — the warm, rhythmic breathing against the back of her neck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She opened her eyes slowly, taking in the dim morning light spilling through the window, across the floorboards and the wall. Rio made a soft, sleepy sound and tightened her hold on Agatha’s waist, pulling her back into her. Agatha let herself be pulled, a sense of complete safety washing over. Her eyes fluttered closed again, savouring it while she could. Waking up beside Rio was something she could very easily get used to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning,” Rio rasped, nestling into her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning,” Agatha replied. “How did you know I was awake?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I heard the cogs in your mind start turning.” Rio pressed a kiss to the bone at the very top of her spine. “How do you feel?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha assessed herself for a moment. There was an insistent, pleasant ache between her legs, desire temporarily satisfied but still smouldering. Her throat felt slightly sore, and her stomach and thigh muscles burned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I feel like you had your way with me all night,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled darkly. “I should hope so.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you? How do you feel?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was silent for a moment, then she said, very quietly, “Loved.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha twisted around in her arms so that they were facing one another, and drew her closer. It was so warm under the covers with Rio. It felt as though they were the only people in the world.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are,” Agatha said, somewhat trepidatiously. “You are loved.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A slow smile spread across Rio’s face, her sleepy eyes full of wonder. “Do you mean that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wouldn’t say it if I didn’t mean it,” Agatha replied. “I only ever tell you the truth,” she added, echoing Rio’s words from that afternoon in the kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blushed prettily, nestling into the pillow. Not for the first time, Agatha noticed how frequently Rio made her feel like a child again, giddy and innocent, full of the sense of life’s possibility.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” she said, reaching up to hold her face. Rio’s eyes fluttered open. “I love you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio positively beamed. “I love you, too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>To her own consternation, Agatha felt tears immediately well in her eyes and spill over. It was an entirely involuntary reaction, borne, she realised, of hearing those words for the first time since Nicky’s death. Nicky had told her he loved her every day, often multiple times. Those words had served as the ultimate comfort for her; the ultimate reassurance that she was needed and important. Dyer hadn’t said he loved her in years. And now, hearing the words from Rio’s mouth, she remembered what it was to feel necessary in someone’s life.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She let out a small sob, embarrassed at the force of her own reaction, burrowing into Rio’s neck. Rio cradled her, rocking her slightly, and pressed a soft kiss to the top of her head.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s alright, Agatha,” she whispered. “I love you. You are loved.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha trembled in her arms, shame and acceptance overcoming her in equal measure. Rio pressed kisses to her hair, to her forehead, to her damp cheeks, holding her face gently but insistently in her hands. She pushed Agatha onto her back, kissing her lips, her eyelids, her jaw.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let herself be consumed by the soft weight of Rio’s body moving against hers; by the ghost of deep sleep now relinquished which lay over her like a blanket. After a while she realised that Rio had found a rhythm, her hips rolling against Agatha’s slowly over and over. Her hand grasped Rio’s lower back to pull her closer and guide her movements. Soon Rio was whimpering into her neck, her breasts brushing against Agatha’s with every thrust.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moved her thigh a little so that it rested in between Rio’s and immediately felt the wet heat of her. She moved Rio onto her back and straddled her, her legs on either side of Rio’s torso.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck,” Rio breathed, wide-eyed. “You’re dripping.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked down and realised that she was — every involuntary rock of her hips painted Rio’s abdomen with her arousal. Now it was Rio’s turn to guide her, her strong hands tugging on Agatha’s hips and encouraging her to thrust against her. Agatha groaned, throwing her head back. Her hair cascaded down her back and her core burned, and she realised that she had never felt so powerful as she did in that moment, Rio at her mercy, letting her use her — encouraging her to do so.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait,” she said. She pressed a hand to Rio’s sternum to hold her down as she shifted her hips, angling herself so that her clit pressed against Rio’s. Rio opened her legs wider, understanding, and with another slight adjustment their cores were pressed flush against each other, wet heat spilling into each other.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio made an inhuman noise. She was deep red, her hairline sweaty, her fingers so tight around Agatha’s hips that Agatha worried for a moment that she might leave handprint bruises. She was an otherworldly vision. Agatha moved faster, each roll of her hips opening them up further to each other. She could feel Rio’s swollen clit pressed against hers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, I think I…” Rio sounded strangled, like she couldn’t get enough air. “Don’t stop, you feel so good, don’t stop.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wouldn't have dreamed of stopping. She chased her own high with singular concentration, feeling it building deep within her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, yes, yes,” Rio was chanting, like a prayer. “Right there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you close?” Agatha managed, although she could barely speak.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“God, yes, just a little more.” Rio threw her forearm over her mouth as if to muffle the sound she was about to make, but Agatha wasn’t going to allow that. She ripped it away and pinned Rio’s wrists on either side of her head, her own movements becoming frantic and irregular.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio cried out her release Agatha followed almost immediately, desperately wringing out their shared pleasure. She felt Rio pulse against her; felt how she just kept going, writhing and moaning until she was spent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha collapsed into her and wrapped her in her arms. Her heart thrummed like a hummingbird, then slowed. She felt like</span>
<span> a leaf borne over a rock by rapidly moving water, carried by Rio’s slow breaths and soothing caresses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As they lay there in the aftermath the room suddenly brightened, awash with blinding daylight, the heavens opening. And with the radiance came a miserable realisation, one that made Agatha feel sick to her core.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The storm was over. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dyer would return, and Rio would leave.</span>

<p>When it became clear that the storm had subsided Agatha and Rio were filled with a sense of immediate urgency. They hurriedly stripped the bed, changed the sheets, washed themselves in ice cold water and dressed in clean clothes, in an attempt to remove all potential evidence of what had passed between them. It was if their brains had switched abruptly from one track to another — from open vulnerability and soft languor to pragmatism and survival.</p><p>The bed was made so as to look untouched and Agatha stashed the sheets in a basket to wash when the weather improved. They swiftly tended to all domestic tasks needed to make it seem as though they had been the picture of industry the whole time. Although they barely spoke, there was an undercurrent of perfect understanding. What had passed between them could not be undone. They were irrevocably changed.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said, as the other woman finished sweeping the kitchen floor. “Just… stop, for a moment. You’ve done all that you can.”</p><p>Agatha leaned the broom against the wall. “You’re right.” She sighed, running a hand through her still-damp hair. “I just… I fear that he will know. That he’ll see it on my face.”</p><p>“Come here,” Rio said, holding out her hand. Agatha took it, and allowed herself to be drawn in. Rio kissed her soundly, then embraced her. Agatha felt herself grow limp in her arms, all of the adrenaline sapped from her body.</p><p>“He won’t know,” Rio said. “Only you and I will ever know. This is between us only.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. She knew how to keep secrets. Everything that passed through her mind each day was a secret she told no one except Nicky’s grave and her own journal — at least not until Rio had come. Dyer had never known the things she thought about when she stood on the hill and stared out over the fields; when she stared into a bucket of soapy water and pictured a different future. This would be no different.</p><p>“Let me brush your hair,” Rio said. “Sit.”</p><p>She guided Agatha to the chair by the fire, fetched the hairbrush and began to brush, beginning at the ends and holding it at the top so that it wouldn’t tug. Agatha closed her eyes and gave herself over to the feeling of Rio looking after her, gently combing through each section of hair and laying it over Agatha’s shoulder to keep it separate.</p><p>Hairbrushing was an act of care that Agatha had never experienced as such. When she was a child her mother would practically rip the hair out of her scalp in her haste to be done with dealing with the tangles, and had, on more than one occasion, simply chopped the knots out with heavy metal scissors. Rio was so careful and so tender that it made her heart ache, and Agatha told her so.</p><p>“I’m sorry that your childhood was anything less than joyous,” Rio said.</p><p>“Joyous it was not. But I made my own happinesses.”</p><p>They fell silent, listening to the sound of the brush catching slightly on Agatha’s tangled hair.</p><p>“I love you,” Agatha found herself saying. In the wide open space of the kitchen, where she had sat so many days with Dyer in one of his foul moods, the words seemed even heavier with meaning than they had before.</p><p>Rio, behind her, encircled her shoulders with her arms and leaned forward to kiss her cheek. “I love you,” she said, simply, and then returned to her task. When she had finished she drew back to look at her handiwork and smiled.</p><p>“My beautiful girl,” she said, and Agatha glowed with the praise.</p><p>Suddenly Azalea shot up and whipped her head around towards the door. The woman sprang apart, Agatha snatching the hairbrush and quickly laying it down on the other side of the room as if it were the most damning evidence of their transgression.</p><p>The sound of crunching snow grew louder, and Agatha knew with dread that it was footsteps. She caught Rio’s eye one last time, straightened her shoulders, and went to open the door to her husband.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Agatha soon found out that the evening of the storm had not been kind to Dyer.</p><p>Finney’s livestock had refused to be herded into the barn, and the two men had been out in the snow for hours. It had reached a point, Dyer told Agatha, where he himself would have given up, and sacrificed the few sheep who would not return in order to save himself. But Finney was stubborn and proud and would not leave a job unfinished. By the time the barn doors were shut and all the livestock were safely inside, Dyer was chilled to the bone, inadequately prepared for the temperature and the harshness of the wind.</p><p>Finney had simply offered him whiskey, which seemed to be his personal solution to all problems, Dyer said. He had not lit a fire, and when Dyer had asked if they could Finney had said that he had not chopped any firewood. By that point the storm was far too dangerous to go out and do so.</p><p>“Did he wonder about his wife’s safety?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“He did not,” Dyer replied. “I told him that she was with you, and that seemed to suffice.”</p><p>The cold and the alcohol, the lack of fire and a proper bed and the solitary journey back to the homestead had done Dyer irrevocable damage. Agatha nursed him for a week, with compresses to his forehead and homemade remedies, but the illness seemed to have settled in his lungs, and his fingers and toes were frostbitten.</p><p>Half of their chickens were lost. Agatha dug ice and snow from their dead open mouths in an attempt to revive them, to no avail.</p><p>When the snow was part-melted Agatha rode into town and sought out the doctor, something she had last done for Nicky. The doctor came and looked over Dyer, whose body by that point was wracked with constant coughing, and shook his head.</p><p>“Continue with the poultices, and give him laudanum twice daily,” the doctor instructed. “Either he will be able to shake this off, or he will not.” He looked at Agatha with sympathy bordering on unbearable pity. He had been there when they had laid Nicky in the ground.</p><p>And all this time there had been no word from Rio. Agatha felt as though she was going mad.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>March 9th, 1856. “Rain in torrents nearly all night,” Agatha wrote. “The lane is flooded and the ditches brim full. This morning, only a slight shower.”</p><p>She paused, listening to Dyer’s wheezing breath in the bed and the guttering of the candle as it burned to the quick. Her pen met the page again, and the words poured out of her. “My heart a maelstrom. My head a bedlam. A whole two weeks and no visit from Rio. No word. My anxieties often force me to stop my work and pace the house like an inmate. I have to see her.”</p><p>The day Dyer finally succumbed to pneumonia was the day that Rio returned.</p>

<p>
<span>Agatha was sitting on the porch, trying and failing to drag fresh air into her lungs, when she saw Azalea bound over the hills, followed by the flash of Rio’s green skirts. She stood immediately, expecting the worst; expecting Finney to be trailing behind her — but he was not.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Upon seeing her Rio broke into a run, and Agatha hurried down the porch steps towards her. The force of their embrace, when they finally reached each other, was enough to send them both stumbling.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, my love,” Rio murmured into her neck, her hands grasping at Agatha’s waist, as if trying to make sure she was real. “Oh, Agatha, I missed you so much.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha breathed her in, feeling her silky hair against her cheek; the thrum of the pulse in her neck. “I thought you might never return,” she admitted, and the pitiful crack in her own voice surprised her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wanted to, every day,” Rio promised. She drew back to stare into Agatha’s eyes searchingly. Agatha noticed that she looked more tired than usual and perhaps thinner too, dark circles underlining her brown irises. She had a cut on her cheekbone, which was fading but looked as though it had once been angrier. Agatha traced it with her thumb, and Rio shivered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I need to talk to you,” she said. The words ‘in private’ went without saying.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked back towards the house. “Not inside. Dyer, he’s…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I heard from the mail messenger that he’s very ill. Agatha, I so wanted to come, I’ve been so worried…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He died this morning,” Agatha said. “I’m waiting for the undertakers. They won’t come until evening.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A myriad of emotions crossed Rio’s face — shock, sadness, sympathy, relief — and settled into something Agatha thought might be envy. “Agatha, I am so sorry.” The words didn’t even begin to encompass what she wanted to say, and they both knew it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s get away from the house,” Agatha said. “I can’t be in there anymore. I feel like I can’t breathe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The woods?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>To get to the woods one had to walk downhill away from the homestead, away from the rise of the hill which became the valley in which the Zebrun farm was situated. They were beautiful woods, full of oak, maple, beech and birch trees. Agatha had spent hours in those woods with Nicky, playfighting with sticks and using charcoal on paper to make rubbings of all of the different leaves they found.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woods were at their most radiant and verdant in spring and summer, and Agatha never set foot in them in winter. But now, with Rio’s arm firmly linked through hers and her insistent warmth against her side, Agatha saw the beauty in them at the very end of winter, everything damp, lying low and waiting to bloom. The smell of the night’s downpour and the morning’s shower lingered in the air, wet petrichor. Mushrooms flourished eerily on every tree stump. They walked deeper and deeper into the woods, until the rustle of the leaves and the occasional caw of birds embraced them, and came to a stop in the middle of a small clearing, facing each other.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha breathed deeply and felt, for the first time in weeks, the air actually reach her lungs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What happened to your face, Rio?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked away, her eyes tracing the branches of the trees, up to where the sky peeked through their cover. Agatha tracked every movement she made, every breath and blink. She was beside her again — the woman she loved.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t account for my husband’s state of mind except to say that my company must be intensely disagreeable to him,” Rio said. “And if that’s the case, I’m sorry for it.” Here it seemed that she had intended to speak with defiance, but her voice wavered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did he hit you?” Agatha said softly. She felt as though she was approaching a scared and wounded animal, and any wrong move might cause her to bolt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Finney reads aloud instructions for wives from the Old Testament, and makes me repeat them back to him,” Rio said. She raised her beautiful brown eyes to heaven and recited, with affected boredom, “For the wife does not have the authority over her own body, but the husband does. Do not deprive one another, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. Ephesians 5:33. Submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio.” Agatha stopped her with a hand on her arm. “Is he hurting you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“When it comes to the Bible,” Rio said, “I have to say that there are a lot of passages he may know word for word, but which haven’t touched his heart.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned away for a moment, collecting herself. She knew that Rio wasn’t deliberately being cagey with her — that she simply did not have the words to explain what was really happening. She knew that feeling well — the certainty that if the cold, stark truth left her lips then it must be reality, and it must be inescapable. Rio was leaving space for them both by not drawing Agatha entirely into what she had been enduring these last two weeks. She was saying, not in so many words, it belongs there and not here, with you.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha stood there she felt a curious tingling sensation in her scalp. She realised that Rio had stepped closer and was tentatively touching the ends of her hair, running her fingers through it, pawing at her gently like a newborn animal would its mother. The little tugs sent small earthquakes through Agatha’s system.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you angry with me?” Rio asked. She sounded distressed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her wretchedness was so affecting that Agatha turned immediately and drew her into her arms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, my love.” She rubbed circles onto Rio’s back. The other woman was shaking. “I could never be angry with you. And besides, you haven’t done anything to deserve anger.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave a small sob. “Finney is mentioning the idea of migrating west.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart almost beat out of her chest at this, but she held herself together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I had an uncle who moved to Ohio and came to a desperate end,” she said drily.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed through her tears. “Which is what one might expect from Ohio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They stood for a moment, gathering themselves.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have thought of nothing but you,” Agatha said finally, “these last two weeks. I have dreamed of nothing but you. As I sat by Dyer’s bedside nursing him I thought of us together in that same bed. I thought I must be evil, for thinking that while he was lying there close to death, but the thoughts would not leave my mind.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not evil, Agatha. You are the purest person I know. Your thoughts and desires are natural, and that you act on them is natural too. You did not choose this life for yourself, but you can choose to defy it.” Rio’s eyes burned with passion as she said this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My mother always told me I was evil,” Agatha said. “She said she knew as soon as I left the womb that I was destined for sin. When I was in labour with Nicky that thought was always at the back of my mind — that he might emerge and I might look upon him and see sin. But when he was given to me to hold I felt only unadulterated love. And I wondered how my mother could ever have thought there was anything within me, a newborn baby, but absolute innocence.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So you know now?” Rio said. “You know now that you are not a sinner.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know that what we did, during the storm, would be considered a sin by most people on this earth. But it didn’t feel like sin, and I don’t think about it that way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What did it feel like, then?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It felt like a gift.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled. “For me, too. Thoughts of those hours have been my greatest comfort these last weeks. They have been running through my mind on an endless loop. All I have to do is imagine those sounds you made, the look on your face, and I’m there again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped closer, guiding Rio backwards until her spine met a large tree trunk. She cradled the back of her head so the rough bark wouldn’t hurt her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Finney has been insisting that we try for a child,” Rio admitted. “I refused his advances so many times, but he persisted, and…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s alright,” Agatha soothed her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I only mention this to say that, when he was inside of me, I was imagining it was you. I closed my eyes tight and willed myself back into your bed. I think Finney was positively surprised at my response.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt a kind of fury bubble up in her that she recognised as extreme jealousy. She wasn’t angry with Rio, not at all, but the idea that someone else had been inside her made her burn. The feeling possessed her, and she pulled the shoulder of Rio’s dress down to expose one of her breasts and sucked at her nipple hard. Rio groaned, her hand scrabbling to find purchase in Agatha’s hair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t be soft with me,” Rio rasped. “Make me forget about everything else.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>In response Agatha tugged the fabric roughly off her other shoulder and pinched her nipple between two fingers, twisting it, continuing to suck on the other. She imagined the picture they made, pressed up against a tree trunk with ivy coiling around it, Rio’s head tilted to the heavens, half naked, Agatha’s mouth on her breast. It made her feel feral.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With her right hand she pushed at Rio’s skirts. Rio bent her knee to allow the fabric to drape over it, making Agatha’s access easier. When she reached her destination they both moaned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re soaked, my love.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“All for you,” Rio whimpered, and slammed her head back against the tree trunk as Agatha began to rub at her hard over the fabric. “Not enough,” she said, moments later.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pushed at Rio’s drawers until they were around her knees and immediately returned to where she had been. Rio was dripping down her thighs, the molten heat a stark contrast with the cold, damp air in the heart of the forest. Agatha didn’t think she’d ever been so aroused in her entire life. She pushed two fingers inside Rio, meeting no resistance whatsoever.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“More,” Rio choked out. She looked gone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha withdrew her fingers and pushed back in again with a third.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want it hard,” Rio whimpered.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re being very demanding,” Agatha said low in her ear. She didn’t recognise her own voice and hadn’t intended her tone to be so stern and admonishing, but it seemed that Rio liked it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Rio said. “Yes, yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha focused in on the movement of her fingers, thrusting them hard and deep, guiding her hand with her hips. She started slow at first, but the rhythm of Rio’s answering thrusts quickly became frantic and irregular and she realised she wanted it faster, so she obliged. She noticed that she could rub her own clit against the back of her hand as she thrust, which was all but physically ineffective through all the layers of fabric, but visually was definitely doing something for her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked down, and when she saw what Agatha was doing she gave a long, incredulous moan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s like you’re fucking me,” she said with difficulty, her body jolting from the force of Agatha’s movements, “like a man.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Better than a man, I hope.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So much better,” Rio gasped.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha kept up her pace but began to curl her fingers with every thrust, rubbing against the rough patch inside Rio which always seemed to make her lose her mind. Every time she did so Rio became impossibly wetter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can you… like this?” Rio gritted out, looking down at Agatha’s movements against her own hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Agatha answered honestly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned forward so her mouth was by Agatha’s ear, and Agatha knew instinctively that she was about to deliver words that would ruin her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So,” Rio said, “you’re going to come inside me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her words tipped Agatha over the edge instantaneously and she cried out loudly. Her erratic rocking against Rio became even more disjointed, but it seemed to work for Rio, who clenched down on her fingers and climaxed hard. Agatha kept her fingers curled deep inside her and felt hot bursts of liquid around them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think…” Rio whispered, “keep going.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Again?” Agatha asked, already speeding up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” Rio said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha resumed her pace, hard and fast, short sharp thrusts which had Rio clinging onto her, digging her fingers into her arm like claws. She was sobbing now, but it looked like release, so Agatha didn’t stop.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mine,” she whispered in her ear. “You’re mine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio climaxed hard again with a guttural groan, and became completely limp.</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was so much more wetness than Agatha had become used to. As she gently pulled her fingers out Rio’s cunt contracted and produced another hot burst of liquid, which had her whimpering and turning her face away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright,” Agatha whispered. “It’s alright, you’re alright.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She brought her hand out from under Rio’s skirts, rearranging her clothing so that it could be as comfortable as possible given that her undergarments were drenched. She licked the evidence of Rio’s arousal from her wrist and hand, still supporting the other woman, who currently reassembled a rag doll — or a fallen angel, Agatha thought. A fallen angel with a halo of dark hair, surrounded by earth and ivy, thoroughly debauched.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We are going to fix this,” Agatha promised. “We are going to find a way. You will not go west, not without me.”</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>When Rio left later that afternoon, distracted and dishevelled, Agatha found herself descending into a state of perpetual dread.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The undertakers came for Dyer’s body, which had spent the past few hours entirely alone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wished she felt guilt — willed herself to feel it, even — but no feeling came except sick, heavy dread at the idea that Finney might take Rio away from her, and she could do nothing about it. She had expected to feel at least some grief at the loss of Dyer — they had, after all, been together for almost a decade, and shared a home, a child, and a life. Instead she felt relief.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She realised then that she had already lost Dyer completely, back when Nicky died. Even before that he had begun to slip away — or perhaps she had slipped away from him. Either way, they had withdrawn from each other. She had been so happy on their wedding day, she remembered, filled with perhaps the greatest joy she had felt in her life until that moment. It was only later that she realised that this happiness stemmed not from her union with her husband, but from the fact that it enabled her to finally escape her mother. That was what Dyer had been to her — an escape.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha knew that perhaps a normal person would feel ashamed for seeing another human in such a pragmatic way; as a tool, or a means to an end. But she was not normal. She never had been. Her mother had made sure of that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So, as she stood alone and watched Dyer’s casket lowered into the ground feet away from Nicky’s, she derived very minimal comfort from the idea that her late husband and her son would now lie beside each other. If anything she envied Dyer for the fact that he was able to do so. The whole way through the funeral — at which she was the only guest, besides the men from the town who carried the coffin — she only thought of Nicky, and of Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, who she hadn’t invited, or indeed told about the funeral, because she felt she couldn’t stand it if she came and stood beside her with Finney not far behind. Agatha would be content to never see that man’s face again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>On the afternoon of March 14th, Agatha opened her journal for the first time since the day of Dyer’s passing. She no longer had to hide it at the back of the cupboard — it lay on the kitchen table in full view, a testament to her newfound freedom, if it could be called that.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hold my love for Rio before me and study it,” she wrote, “as if it were the incomplete map of our escape. When the day is done, my mind turns to her, and I think, with a special heat, “Why are we to be separated?””</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was exactly a month after the dinner the four of them had shared, Agatha realised with a sick lurch. The dinner when she had worn her best dress for Rio and seen, for the first time, a flash of desire in her eyes. The dinner when she had told Rio she missed her, although she didn’t know then what it was to truly miss her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She heard a commotion outside, and went out onto the porch to find Finney and his horse thundering past.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good afternoon, Agatha,” Finney called. He tugged harshly on the reins. The horse whinnied and came to a halt.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good afternoon,” Agatha replied, from the relative safety of the porch. The dread tugged at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I came to give my condolences,” Finney said. His horse reared a little and trotted in a circle. God, even the animal can sense he’s bad news, Agatha thought, somewhat surprised at the force of her own wrath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you,” she replied. She would give him nothing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My wife told me you’re considering selling the farm.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have sold it,” Agatha said. “I signed the deed this morning.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The livestock and land are too much for you alone, I suppose.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Exactly.” Agatha kept her face stony. The last time they had seen each other she had played the part of the perfect neighbour; the perfect wife. Now she was a widow. A widow who his wife was in love with, and he had no idea.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where will you go?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve not decided. I have a month until I have to leave. Somewhere smaller, certainly.” Somewhere smaller and not in this county, she thought to herself. Somewhere smaller far, far away, with your wife by my side.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My wife thought it pertinent to invite you for dinner,” Finney said. “Tonight, if you will?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s very kind,” Agatha said. “I’ll be there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“At seven, then,” Finney said. He nodded to her, before spurring on his horse and disappearing over the hill.</span>
</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha wore a black dress — the one she had worn for Nicky’s funeral, and then for Dyer’s. She left her hair loose, thinking of how it would please Rio. It reached her waist now, a measure of the time that had passed, and of all that had happened. As dusk began to fall, she set out for the Zebrun farm.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The walk wasn’t long, but it was windy, and the hills felt hostile. She drew her wrap around herself and wondered if Rio would embrace her when she arrived. She needed it; longed for it; felt keenly that Rio’s touch and the warmth of her arms were the only thing that could console her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>As she drew closer to the homestead she saw silhouettes in the window. Rio’s smaller, slighter body, and Finney standing over her, gripping her upper arms. She watched Rio shake herself free and pull away. Azalea was on the porch, whining. She looked at Agatha with such plaintive eyes as she climbed the steps that Agatha could have wept. Instead she knocked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was Rio who opened the door. There was a flush high in her cheeks, and her eyes were wild.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” she breathed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finney stepped up behind her and lay a hand on her waist. “Agatha, welcome.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio did not move towards her, so Agatha knew it was wise to keep a distance. She was led to a seat at the table by Finney, who refused to let her help in the kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio is perfectly capable,” he said, taking a gulp of what Agatha supposed was whiskey. “In fact it would do her good. You must rest, you are grieving. Your husband was a great man.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha studied his face — his dark beard, his furrowed brows and his narrow eyes. He had a look of meanness about him that she had always noticed, but now she registered it as outright cruelty. He had a habit of drumming his fingers on the table over and over, like a beast stalking its prey, waiting for the moment to pounce.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Here,” Rio said softly, placing a plate and a glass of wine in front of her, and then in front of Finney.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you,” Agatha murmured. She could feel fear blooming within her and was frustrated with herself for it, but there was something about the way Finney was studying her that made her feel like an insect under a microscope. The fear unfurled in her stomach and began to thrum in her throat, until Rio sat down beside her with her own plate and glass.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Put that away,” Finney said sharply, gesturing to Rio’s glass of wine.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio flinched. “It’s fine, I’m not…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finney snatched the glass and drank it down, his eyes fixed on Rio the entire time, and then slammed it down on the table.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My wife is with child,” he said to Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I see,” Agatha said. She turned to Rio, who looked down at her plate. “Congratulations.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt the walls begin to close in on her, and wondered what would happen if she said she needed to leave. She imagined herself snatching her wrap from the hook by the door and running out into the pitch dark with no candle to guide her, trusting herself to retrace her steps back to the homestead by memory. She almost stood then and there, but held herself back. For Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finney refilled his glass of whiskey from the bottle which Rio had placed in front of him, clumsily, spilling it over the rim.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let me raise a toast,” he said. He was slurring a little, Agatha noticed. “To my wife and the child she is carrying. May he remind her of her place in the home. And to Dyer, may he rest in peace.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised her glass. Rio bowed her head. From her vantage point on Rio’s side of the table Agatha could see the other woman’s thighs shaking violently. She knew that feeling well — when panic spiralled out of one’s reach and the body reacted in uncontrollable ways. Rio was hyperventilating a little, quietly. As imperceptibly as she could manage, Agatha laid her hand on Rio’s thigh. She pressed down, hoping the weight would ground her, and rubbed her hand back and forth, breathing deeply and loudly, praying that Rio would hear her slow breaths and follow suit.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your husband was an admirable farmer,” Finney said. “The soul of patience.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He was an exceedingly patient man, that is true.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had full body shivers now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve never been able to harness that particular trait,” Finney said. “Patience.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a coin lying on the table, and he began to spin it and then slam his hand down upon it at random intervals.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“When I first began farming,” he continued, “I was so vexed at my own inability to stop my dogs barking that one January, during a storm, I held the dog around the corner of the barn in a gale until it froze to death.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He looked between Agatha and Rio as if daring them to say something. His eyes were glassy and unfocussed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I nearly froze to death myself,” he slurred, “at least froze my hands, even with my heavy work gloves.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t help herself. “That is reprehensible,” she said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Finney looked at her incredulously. His eyes darted to Rio. And then, suddenly, his whole body stiffened, and a choked sound escaped his throat. He grasped at the table, his eyes widening, and reached out towards Rio as if to grab her. Agatha stood with a screech of her chair and pushed Rio behind her, backing away. Finney choked again, his throat emitting an awful wheeze, and then he slumped forward, his head hitting the table with a bang. He lay there, entirely motionless.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned to Rio then, reaching blindly for her hand. “What is happening?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, somehow, looked at once absolutely terrified and entirely composed. The tremors were gone from her body and she was completely alert. She stared at Finney’s inanimate form. “Agatha, do you trust me?” she said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Unconditionally,” Agatha told her, without missing a beat.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then we have to go. Right now.”</span>

<p>“I’ve packed my bags,” Rio said. She pressed her fingertips to Finney’s pulsepoint, waited for a moment, and then nodded almost imperceptibly. “I’ll fix up the horse and cart and we’ll make west. We’ll stop at your homestead on the way for you to gather your things. Okay, Agatha?”</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha said obediently.</p><p>Rio cleared away the third plate and glass as if they had never been there, and poured the last dregs of the whiskey down the sink.</p><p>“What did you give him?” Agatha asked, in a hushed tone of awe. She could see the flecks of something lingering in the bottom of the whiskey bottle before Rio rinsed it with water. Finney would have seen them too, if he hadn’t been such an oblivious fool.</p><p>“Belladonna,” Rio said, very seriously. “I got it from the witch doctor at the market.”</p><p>“How did you know how much to give him?”</p><p>“I wasn’t sure if it could kill him,” Rio said. She opened a cupboard, pulled out two bags and piled them by the door, shrugging on her wrap. “I’ve been trying to sedate him for the better part of the week. He wouldn’t stop putting his hands on me.”</p><p>“Are you hurt?” Agatha said. She wondered if Rio’s impressive practicality would at some point falter. They both cast their eyes towards her lifeless husband, slumped across the table.</p><p>“I’m…” Rio trailed off. “We should talk about this on the road. Help me with the cart?”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>The cover of darkness was welcome as they drew away from the Zebrun farm. The meager light cast by the sliver of crescent moon did all but nothing to illuminate their way, but Rio’s horse seemed to know where she was going.</p><p>As Rio cast a last glance back towards the farm, the lit candle in the kitchen caught her eye. It was a fresh one and nowhere near burnt down, right at the head of the long table beside Finney’s prone form.</p><p>“I should blow that candle out,” Rio said. “Stay here for a moment?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. The fear had not left her yet, but it had been taken over by excitement. She felt awake and alive.</p><p>Rio jumped down from the cart and made her way inside the house. Azalea by her side, Agatha raised her head to stare at the fast-moving clouds gliding past, stars speckled across the sky.</p><p>Earlier that day she had accidentally opened her journal at a page from August of 1855. “After the calamity of Nicky’s loss,” she had written there, “what calm I enjoy does not derive from the notion of a better world to come.”</p><p>There had been no future that she could envisage that would save her from a lifetime of monotony and suffering. She had thought that she would continue to wake every morning until her dying day pierced with the pain of grief and resigned to her fate. But now, as she stared up at the night sky, she could see a hundred different variations of her life to come pan out before her. In all of them, Rio was by her side.</p><p>A movement in her peripheral vision distracted her, and she lowered her eyes to see the barn door pushed wide open. The sheep and cows, lethargic and confused, probably having just woken from slumber, were nosing their way out into the field.</p><p>Rio returned and jumped up beside her. “I could not leave them in the same cage I was in,” she explained. “That would be cruel.”</p><p>Agatha felt overwhelmed with love for her. She pressed a kiss to Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>“As I was blowing out the candle,” Rio said, turning the cart around, “I considered burning the house to the ground.”</p><p>“Perhaps you should,” Agatha said. She imagined flames licking up the timber frame, destroying the walls which had seen too much anger, enveloping Finney until he was nothing but ashes.</p><p>“I don’t want to leave any more destruction in my wake,” Rio said simply. “This is enough for me.”</p><p>The farm receded into the distance. Agatha craned around to look at it once more before it finally disappeared behind the hill. Rio resolutely did not.</p><p>“Are you alright, my love?” Agatha ventured.</p><p>“I just need to get away from here,” Rio replied. “I’ll be fine once we’re away.”</p><p>They had arrived at Agatha’s homestead. Agatha gathered her skirts and stepped down from the cart.</p><p>“Stay here,” she said to Rio. “I won’t be long at all.”</p><p>Inside, Agatha surveyed the evidence of her entire life before this moment. There wasn’t much — Dyer had always expressed a dislike for clutter. After his death, Agatha had strung bunches of herbs and plants around the kitchen to bring some life into the space. They hung there now in the disparate moonlight, ghostly.</p><p>Agatha opened her largest bag on the bed, throwing in necessities — dresses, undergarments, a shawl, her hairbrush. She slid her journal and atlas in beside them, the money from the sale of the homestead and livestock folded into the pages; wrapped her pen and bottle of ink in beeswax-covered cloth to prevent leaks. On the dresser lay her only piece of jewellery — a cameo locket depicting three female figures. Inside was a lock of Nicky’s hair. With shaking hands, she put it on.</p><p>Nicky.</p><p>Never once since Nicky’s passing had she considered the idea that she would not live beside his grave. She had planned to be buried there, when the time came. And now, she realised, they were going to leave him behind.</p><p>She left the house without a backward glance, shutting the door firmly behind her. Rio was waiting in the cart. When she saw Agatha, a slow smile spread across her face.</p><p>“Do you want—”</p><p>“Can we—”</p><p>They both spoke at the same time, and stopped to laugh.</p><p>“You first,” Agatha said. She dropped her bag beside Rio’s in the back of the cart.</p><p>“I was going to say, do you want to bid farewell to Nicky’s grave?” Rio said.</p><p>Agatha stopped to stare at her. Rio’s ability to read her mind never ceased to amaze her, but especially in this moment it rendered her speechless. Her heart warmed at the idea that while Rio had sat out here alone she had been considering that, even in the midst of all the strangeness, and felt profoundly understood.</p><p>“That is what I was going to ask,” Agatha said. She looked up at Rio, and lay a hand on her knee. “Tie up the horse and come with me?”</p><p>“Of course, my love.”</p><p>Rio’s readiness to do things for her didn’t escape Agatha’s notice, either. She’d been like that since they’d met, always so eager to help, but now it had taken on a different significance. It felt as though they were partners, Agatha thought. Partners in crime now, it seemed, but also partners in life. She didn’t even need to speak and Rio knew what she needed.</p><p>They climbed the hill together, up to the point where Agatha had stood all those months ago and first seen Rio, a mere speck in the valley below. They were both slightly out of breath from exertion and Agatha felt herself getting warmer, the chill leaving her body. They climbed further, up to where the grass had recently been trodden down by the men from town bearing Dyer’s casket. When they drew closer, they both stopped, and Agatha gasped.</p><p>Beside the place where the earth had been freshly overturned for Dyer’s grave was a miraculous bloom of flowers, surrounding Nicky’s headstone. More flowers than Agatha had ever seen in one place — the softly rounded heads of clover, some white, some turning purple, and clusters of bluebells, their heads dipping as if in respect.</p><p>“Did you do this?” Rio asked breathlessly. Her hand found Agatha’s, firm and dry and reassuring.</p><p>“No,” Agatha replied, in wonderment. She knelt before the headstone as she usually did when the weather was warmer, careful not to crush any flowers. The damp cold seeped through her dress, but she couldn’t bring herself to care. When she turned around, Rio’s eyes were brimming with unshed tears.</p><p>“Come here,” Agatha said, reaching out for her. Rio came and knelt by her side. Agatha reached out a hand to press it against the earth by the headstone, and Rio, hesitantly did the same.</p><p>“Thank you, Nicky,” Agatha said, “for being everything I could have ever wanted. For making life not only liveable but glorious for those too few years that I had you. We always used to talk about adventuring. About exploring the far-off limits of this country and seeing new horizons. We never could do that together.” Her voice cracked and the tears began to fall. “But I will do it now with you in my thoughts at every moment.”</p><p>The wind stirred the flowers, and the scent of wet earth and new life filled the air. Rio’s hand was still flat against the earth beside Agatha’s.</p><p>“Thank you for looking after me always, even when you were not physically with me. For so long I have had no one but you — no one to provide any consolement or guidance. It has been so lonely. But now I have Rio.”</p><p>Agatha cast a glance at her, and Rio was looking at her reverently, expectantly.</p><p>“I have no way of knowing what is to come,” Agatha continued, “but I do know that all of the trust and care and courage we shared, that will all shine on us and protect us. You are my city of joy. She is my city of joy.”</p><p>She rose, and Rio rose with her. “Goodbye, Nicky,” Agatha choked out.</p><p>“Goodbye, Nicky,” Rio echoed softly. And then she took Agatha’s hand in hers once more and led them back down the hill, all remnants of Agatha’s past life buried behind them.</p>

<p>Agatha wasn’t sure when she’d fallen asleep, lulled by the comforting rhythm of the wheels of the cart turning over the earth and Rio’s occasional soft words of encouragement to her horse.</p><p>When she awoke, it was to near-blinding golden light, falling diffuse through leaves. They were in some kind of corridor of trees, a dirt track running through it and disappearing into the distance, sheltered as far as the eye could see. Her head was resting on Rio’s shoulder — Rio who was still very much awake and had clearly guided them through the night.</p><p>“Where are we?” Agatha said sleepily.</p><p>“I don’t really know,” Rio said. “We’re heading west to Pennsylvania. I might need to break soon.”</p><p>“Of course,” Agatha said. “I can take over.”</p><p>The landscape was already distinct from what she had come to know in Schoharie County. It was leafier, and the air felt changed, as though spring had broken loose overnight.</p><p>“I never dared imagine that we would make it out, not really,” Agatha murmured.</p><p>“It’s a good thing we remember that our imaginations can always be cultivated,” Rio said.</p><p>There was a sparkle in her eye as she looked across at Agatha, the morning sun dancing in her hair and turning it auburn. Agatha lay her head back on her shoulder, breathed deeply and closed her eyes, succumbing again to sleep.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Almost four weeks later, with many stops along the way, they made it across the border between Pennsylvania and Ohio and then to Glendale, a small settlement. After asking around in town they were directed to a small stone cottage in a secluded area not too far from civilisation, but close enough to the forest that it felt sheltered and private. Agatha handed over the money immediately.</p><p>A bedraggled vegetable patch, a modest and very overgrown garden and a slightly mangey chicken came with the cottage. Rio promptly began to make the garden her own, spending hours weeding and sowing. Agatha named the chicken Scratchy, as seemed to befit his dishevelled appearance, and took to having lengthy conversations with him when she gave him his feed in the morning. They got to know the vendors at the weekly market, who recommended copious varieties of flower seeds to Rio and supplied Agatha with various books.</p><p>They had feared that the townspeople might think it strange, two women settling down together in such a remote location. People had made various comments while they were on the road out west. But it turned out that what they decided to frame as their ‘predicament’ — two recently bereaved widows, one with child — garnered nothing but sympathy and vague interest from the locals, all of whom took it upon themselves to lend them help.</p><p>Rio, it transpired, was indeed with child.</p><p>Agatha had found her turning back and forth in the new mirror one morning, running her hands distractedly over her stomach. Rio had looked over at her where she stood in the doorway, her wide eyes full of apprehension, and said, “I haven’t bled in six weeks.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>They spent many of those first sunlit afternoons in the cottage in much the same way. This one was no different, Rio on her hands and knees on the bed, Agatha behind her driving three fingers into her at a brutal pace. This was how Rio liked it most of the time, they had discovered, hard and fast and dirty, begging Agatha to do all kinds of things to her. Agatha loved it, loved Rio like this; loved the deep arch of her back and how she clenched her hands around the sheets and sobbed her release in the pillow. But today, after she had come, Agatha realised Rio was crying real tears.</p><p>“What is it, my darling?” Agatha was filled with concern, soothing her hands over Rio’s sharp shoulder blades. “Was it too much?”</p><p>“No, I just…” Rio trailed off, heaving out a deep sigh. “I wish it were you who’d put this baby inside me,” she admitted sheepishly, through her tears.</p><p>“Well, it’s not for lack of trying,” Agatha quipped, then realised that Rio was being very serious. “Rio, this is our child,” she said firmly. “They were conceived during the first season of our love. That means more than mere biology ever could.”</p><p>“You promise?”</p><p>“I promise.”</p><p>“I’ve never wanted to bear a child. The idea of a little skeleton growing inside me… it’s… I don’t know. What will it feel like?”</p><p>Rio sounded so innocent in that moment that a primal urge to shelter and protect her rose within Agatha. Was this what husbands always felt for their pregnant wives? If so, she didn’t understand how they could ever bring themselves to leave their sides. Agatha felt certain that she would lay down her life at Rio’s feet if circumstance required it.</p><p>“It feels like nothing at first,” Agatha said. “But when Nicky began to stir… it was like butterflies flapping their wings. Later, like a rabbit, when he kicked his legs at night.”</p><p>Rio looked vaguely terrified.</p><p>“When the time comes I will be there to guide you through it,” Agatha soothed.</p><p>“I’m scared of how my body will change, physically,” Rio admitted. “You know, before, and then afterwards.”</p><p>“You like <em> my </em> body, don’t you?” Agatha turned Rio over, took her hand and brought it to the soft pouch of her own stomach, which she herself now loved, affirmed by Rio’s very obvious obsession with it.</p><p>Rio looked affronted. “I love it.”</p><p>“Well then there’s nothing to be afraid of.”</p><p>Rio smiled through her drying tears. “Come here,” she said, gesturing to her face. “Come and sit here. I want to make you feel good.”</p><p>Agatha obliged without hesitation, slinging her leg over Rio’s shoulder and sinking down against Rio’s warm, willing tongue, which lapped up into her immediately. Agatha rode her face languorously, indulgently, Rio’s nose nudging deliciously against her clit with every roll of her hips.</p><p>“You’re perfect,” Agatha murmured. She grasped at her own breasts as she moved, rubbing her thumbs back and forth over her pebbled nipples as she knew Rio would do if she weren’t desperately using her hands to pull Agatha’s hips impossibly closer to her.</p><p>Rio moaned into her and Agatha’s orgasm hit her hard, without warning, crashing like a wave and then slowly ebbing out like water on a distant shore. She grasped frantically at the headboard and dropped her face onto her forearms, panting, her pleasure overwhelming her.</p><p>Rio helped her down onto the mattress, sliding on top of her. Her cunt was dripping wet against Agatha’s hipbone and she arranged herself so that both of them were pressed against the other’s thigh. Her hair fell over Agatha’s face like a curtain shielding them from the rest of the world, in a wash of lavender and rosemary.</p><p>Agatha knew that Rio always needed to come again after eating her out, so she held Rio’s hips and guided her to move against her. She was extremely sensitive from her own climax, almost too sensitive, the stimulation bordering on painful, but the smooth, insistent weight of Rio’s thigh had her building up to a peak again quickly.</p><p>Rio was moaning in her ear, huffing out sharp little breaths. When Agatha drew back to look at her, Rio's expression was one of deep concentration as she chased her own pleasure with a furrowed brow. Agatha knew she sometimes got like this, desperate and too wound up, needing to be soothed.</p><p>“Slow down, darling, it’s okay,” Agatha murmured. “Breathe.” She shifted Rio’s weight and rearranged their tangle of limbs so that their cunts pressed against each other. They had become good at this, the familiarity of it making it no less novel. It was Agatha’s preferred way to come, usually with her on top, Rio falling apart underneath her. Now it was Rio pressing her down into the mattress, guiding their rhythm, spilling against her.</p><p>“Oh god,” Rio whimpered. She reached down blindly to pinch at Agatha’s nipples, each sharp bite of sensation going straight to Agatha’s core. “I love you like this, love you, want you like this forever.”</p><p>Agatha smiled fondly. She adored how vocal Rio was about her pleasure; the way she would lapse into babbled nonsense right before she came, Agatha waiting expectantly to see what would come out of her mouth.</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio breathed. “I’m close, I’m going to — oh, fuck, <em> fuck</em>.”</p><p>Agatha felt her gush against her, and then a minute later her own answering climax, slow, toe-curling and blissful. She closed her eyes, colours dancing against her eyelids, and felt Rio sink down into her arms, sated.</p><p>“I can’t believe this is our life,” Rio murmured. “I can’t believe I’m allowed to have you like this.”</p><p>Agatha opened her eyes to find her field of vision obscured by mussed dark hair. Rio had attached herself to her like a limpet, always clingy after a few orgasms. Agatha pressed a kiss against her head.</p><p>“It <em> is </em> quite beyond belief, isn’t it?”</p><p>Her eyes took in the mismatched furniture around them — the slightly rusted frame of the mirror, the faded floral curtains, the knick knacks on the dresser, Rio’s petticoat flung haphazardly across the floor.</p><p>“I look back at everything that led us here and I am astonished that we managed it,” Rio said. “I remember us back then and I feel we were so young, somehow, so naïve. Yet we knew exactly what we wanted and it has materialised for us.”</p><p>Agatha allowed herself to look back on that time too — the afternoons spent together folding laundry in the bitter wind, chopping vegetables at the sink and laughing at some astute observation Rio had made. There was one particular moment that her brain alighted upon.</p><p>“Do you know what memory it is that I most cherish?” she said to Rio.</p><p>“What?” Rio looked up at her with those huge brown eyes, and Agatha felt her heart swell.</p><p>“It’s of you turning to me with that smile you gave me,” she said, “once you realised that you were loved.”</p><p> </p><p align="center">THE END</p>
