      Chapter 1: The rookie
  </h2>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<blockquote>
<p>“When they really went to complete overhand pitching, I was home free. I knew all the pitches and they had a lot of trouble hitting off me.”</p>
<p>Jean Faut - The only known professional baseball pitcher, man or woman, to pitch two perfect games in a career.</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>The 1948 season was a lesson in change for everybody in the league.</p><p>Underhand pitching was out. Overhand pitching was in. </p><p>They were already two months into the season, and most hitters were still struggling to adjust. The ball was also smaller, travelling faster, and moving in new ways. That would be an issue for anyone. Anyone except the star player on the Kenosha Comets, Agatha Harkness. </p><p>Agatha was a veteran of the league at this point, having faithfully played as catcher for the same team since its inception five years ago. She topped the table with her batting average and home runs. Her teammates thought her bat was magic because it had an uncanny way of always finding the ball. Pitchers feared her, outfielders cursed her, and fans were in awe of her raw strength and ability. She was a darling of the papers and regularly interviewed by adoring journalists and radio hosts. </p><p>The sun was pounding down on this July day as the Comets faced off against the newly-formed Springfield Sallies. They were only created this year as the popularity of the league was growing and more cities wanted their own ball club. The sky was completely clear, the stands were packed - a perfect Saturday for baseball. The anthem was sung, the players were all stretched and ready. </p><p>“Play ball!”</p><p>The home team took to the field and started tossing the ball around. </p><p>Ruth Taylor took her spot as the starting pitcher for the Sallies. She had adapted her pitching style to a sidearm slinger but couldn’t quite match her underhand velocity. It was a whole different ball game now. The league had started a degree away from the traditional softball and now it had tipped right past the line towards baseball. Most of the league’s pitchers couldn’t make the transition as easily. It was a death blow and meant many had left the game entirely. </p><p>Ruth was one of the few lucky ones who could adjust and keep her position, but it was a battle. </p><p>By the time the game reached the fourth inning, the Comets were up by 5 runs and the Sallies coach made his way out to the mound to relieve Ruth. </p><p>“Who’s that?” Agatha elbowed Wanda and pointed to the new pitcher warming up on the mound. </p><p>Wanda squinted out of the dugout, “Never seen her before.”</p><p>They watched the mystery woman toss out a few warm up pitches. </p><p>“Doesn’t look like a problem. I wonder what happened to their normal reliever, Betty, now that gal could really throw.” Agatha remarked. </p><p>“She got engaged last Christmas! Didn’t you get a wedding invite? They’re moving out to Madison.” She lowered her voice, “And I heard that he didn’t want her coming back this year.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and went to get her bat, “What a shame. And now she’s been replaced by this rookie, what is this game coming to?” </p><p>“What do you have against love?” Wanda looked at her aghast. </p><p>“Love is for suckers.” Agatha laughed and stepped out of the dugout into the on deck circle. She took a few swings to get loose. “Show this newbie how we do things, Shirley.”</p><p>The lead-off hitter smiled at her and nodded as she passed on her way to the plate. Shirley Cohen was a solid contact hitter that the team relied on to get on base. A bit of an anxious person, but when her confidence was up, she was a great ballplayer. </p><p>The pitcher wound up. She brought both hands up behind her head as she leaned back. Her leg went high into the air, straight out in a line as she shifted her weight to her back foot. </p><p><em> What the…? </em> Agatha thought as she watched the motion. <em> What is she doing? </em></p><p>“Strike!” The umpire’s voice rang out. </p><p>Shirley turned back to look at the ump, “What?” </p><p>The catcher tossed the ball back to the pitcher who was smirking. </p><p>“No balls, one strike.” The umpire reiterated. </p><p>Agatha rubbed her eyes. <em> How did I miss it? I didn’t even see it leave her hand. </em></p><p>She wasn’t going to make that mistake again. She put her bat down on the ground and leaned against it, focussing entirely on the pitcher. She was pretty young, brown hair to her shoulders, mischievous eyes. There was something wild in those eyes. </p><p><em> There she goes again with that wind-up. Okay, focus on her hand. </em> The ball rolled from her fingers this time and started high. <em> That’s way outside the strike zone - don’t swing, Shirley. </em> </p><p>The batter took a chop at it, nervous due to the last pitch, and almost lost her footing as the ball dropped into the catcher’s mitt. Her face was twisted in confusion as she looked back at Agatha. </p><p>“Strike!”</p><p>The pitcher was calm as she stretched her neck side to side. She took a deep breath, and Agatha watched the final pitch zip right into the catcher’s glove. Shirley didn’t even have time to think about swinging. </p><p>“Strike three, you’re out!” </p><p>The home crowd cheered wildly as the pitcher took a dramatic bow. Agatha frowned. She hated cockiness. Confidence was one thing, but cockiness pissed her off. </p><p>Shirley made the slow walk back to the dugout. Her eyes were dazed. It was like she had just seen a ghost. Agatha gave her a soft pat on the shoulder as she passed, then tried to steady herself to get ready.</p><p>
<em> Time to welcome this rookie to the big leagues. </em>
</p><p>“Coming up to the plate, they call her “Angel” and it’s not just because of her heavenly good looks, number 3, Agatha Harkness.” The announcer's voice resonated throughout the stadium. She took her stance in the box. </p><p>“Don’t blink.” The catcher, Carson Shaw, whispered at her from behind home plate.</p><p>“Shut it, Shaw.” Agatha spoke out of the side of her mouth, trying to focus. </p><p>The pitcher nodded subtly then stood tall. She started her ridiculous wind-up. </p><p>
<em> Eye on the ball. Eye on the ball.  </em>
</p><p>It soared through the air, but Agatha could see the arcing motion. <em> That’s inside.  </em></p><p>“Ball.” The umpire called. </p><p>“Good eye, Angel!” She heard Wanda yell out. </p><p>The pitcher was studying her now. She felt those deep brown eyes looking at her with curiosity. She stared straight back.</p><p>The wind-up, the pitch.</p><p>
<em> It’s high. Lay off it.  </em>
</p><p>“Ball.”</p><p>Agatha let out an audible scoff. Another rookie pitcher who can’t handle the pressure. <em> That strikeout must have been a fluke.  </em></p><p>She watched the pitcher try to reset. She was circling the rubber and stretching her hand. They made eye contact, and Agatha decided to give her a wink. </p><p><em> Oop, she did not like that. </em> The pitcher’s eyebrows turned down at the gesture, and she spun around, rolling her shoulders back as she rolled the ball over in her glove. She took a longer pause this time as she readied herself. </p><p>She kicked out, her arm swung around quickly, and Agatha watched the ball flying towards her. Wait, it was actually flying directly towards her. <em> Jesus Christ.  </em></p><p>She hit the ground as fast as possible to avoid the incoming bullet, and the ball hit the fence of the backstop. Even the catcher hadn’t seen that coming. </p><p>Agatha jumped up and threw her bat down. She hastily wiped the dirt from her hands. All critical thinking went out the window.  </p><p>She charged the mound. </p><p>“Are you kidding me?!” She got right into the pitcher’s face. “You could have knocked me out!”</p><p>Her teammates were yelling at her to get back. The crowd had gasped and gone quiet. One wrong move, one overheard curse word, and she could be fined or suspended. In that moment though, she couldn’t care less. </p><p>“Huh? What the hell are you playing at?” Agatha was a breath away from the pitcher. Their cap bills were just touching. </p><p>The dark-haired rookie just stayed silent and stared. She licked her lips and did the single thing that sent Agatha over the edge. Her lips went up in a slow smile, and she shrugged. </p><p>Something in her snapped. Her rage boiled to the surface like a roiling kettle. She shoved the smug, overconfident amateur with all her might, causing her to backpedal and fall into the dirt.</p><p>The pitcher kept her mouth shut and still had that infuriating smile plastered on her face, even as she was laying on the ground. </p><p>“Hey! Harkness!!” The coach stormed out onto the field, followed by a few teammates and the umpires. </p><p>The head ump pointed to her and dramatically gestured his thumb behind his shoulder. “You’re outta here!” </p><p>“What!!?” Agatha barked. “She’s the one who almost took my head off!” She said pointing to the pitcher who was being helped up by the second baseman. </p><p>Wanda held onto her shoulders to keep her steady and hold her back. “Watch it.” She whispered in Agatha’s ear, but all she could hear was her own blood pumping through her veins.  </p><p>“Stop talking. Now!” Coach Grant pulled her by the arm to get her away from the scene of the crime. “I apologize for this one. She’s not feeling well today, Rich.” He addressed the ump. </p><p>“She’s got one minute to leave the grounds before I make it a two-game suspension.” </p><p>Agatha went to pipe up but felt the coach quickly leading her back to the bench. “Coach, you saw what she did. She threw a headhunter.” </p><p>“And she would have dealt with the consequences. Instead, you flipped your wig and are out of this game.” </p><p>“She did it on purpose!”</p><p>“That’s baseball.” Doc Grant was a seasoned catcher who played four years for the Cincinnati Reds. He tore his ACL his last season and was forced to hang up his glove. When the opportunity to coach came around, he jumped at the chance. </p><p>Just shy of 40, he was the youngest coach in the league, but he loved the game. While others turned their noses up at the idea of women playing ball, he welcomed the challenge. He took a particular liking to Agatha and not just because she was also a catcher. She had grit, drive, and the unrelenting desire to win. </p><p>“Go home, Harkness. Cool off.” He pointed her to the change rooms. </p><p>“But-”</p><p>“I don’t want to hear it. Go!” </p><p>Agatha groaned and grabbed her mitt before dragging her feet to the locker room. Wanda followed at her heels. </p><p>“Are you here to tell me off, too?” She looked over at the redhead. </p><p>“If you hadn’t gone after that pitcher, I was ready to throw hands.” She jokingly held up her fists like a boxer. </p><p>“Ha! That would have been a real crack up. So you’re on my side?”</p><p>“Obviously. It’s not like we have helmets or anything. One fastball to the skull and that could be lights out. That was dangerous.” Wanda threw an arm around Agatha’s shoulder as they walked down the hall. </p><p>The two hadn’t been fast friends. In fact, her presence had annoyed Agatha from the jump, or more specifically the presence of two stragglers that came with the new arrival. Wanda was traded to the Comets two years ago from Fort Wayne. She showed up with her twin three-year-old sons in tow, as her husband had been killed in action on the frontlines. </p><p>
<em> “Coach, we can’t let some kids run around the dugout. It’s not…it’s not safe!” She had argued.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “What am I meant to say, Hark? She’s a widow for Christ's sake. She has nobody else. They have nowhere else to go. She’s a damn fine ballplayer; she’s staying.”  </em>
</p><p>She couldn’t say aloud the real reason that she wanted the twins out. They were a painful reminder of her own past. The thing that had spurred her to try out for the league in the first place. The awful memory that had pushed her to run. </p><p>Wanda was like a pesky tick. She had burrowed her way into Agatha’s life. Slowly but surely she had grown to like her, despite her best efforts to not. Maybe it was her joyful naivete, her surprisingly strong arm, or her loyal friendship. Whatever the case, the pair were now as close as ever.</p><p>Agatha dropped her glove into her bag and started unbuttoning her uniform. “Aren’t you up to bat soon? This ain’t a peep show.” </p><p>“Nothing I haven’t seen before, babe. And there’s still a few to go. I haven’t even heard the announcer restart the game yet. Just wanted to make sure you’re okay.” </p><p>“I’m fine. Don’t worry, Red. I’ll go to the hotel and sleep it off. We can hit the bar tonight when everyone’s back. I think one of the gals got a lead on a hotspot downtown.” </p><p>“Yeah, alright. I’ll see if Lilia can watch the boys. You sure you’re good?”</p><p>“I’m sweet, really. Get back out there.” Agatha wanted to be alone. This was the first time she had ever been ejected from a game. She’d masterfully toed the line her whole career between following the rules and getting what she wanted. The umpires never gave her grief. She had solid relationships with the team chaperone, Lilia, with the coach, with all the umps, with the bosses in the head office. </p><p><b>One </b>match-up with this rookie, and she’d thrown it all away. Her reputation potentially sullied from a moment of weakness. How pathetic. </p><p>Wanda turned to leave before Agatha remembered, “Wait!”</p><p>“What?” </p><p>“Did you catch the pitcher’s name?” Agatha asked. </p><p>“Rio. Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Agatha watched her friend walk away. She repeated the name over and over again in her mind. </p><p>
<em> Rio Vidal. Rio Vidal. Rio Vidal.  </em>
</p><p>It was annoyingly unique. Foreign. Punchy. Irritating.</p><p>She reached into her bag and pulled out her journal. She sat on the long bench in the middle of the room. After every game, she liked to write down her thoughts, feelings, and reflections on her performance. It was a fun keepsake each season and helped her learn and get better. She already had four filled books sitting on her shelf back home. She was only a few pages into the fifth. </p><p>
<em> July 10th, 1948 </em>
</p><p>
<em> I singled in the first inning against Ruth Taylor. It was a solid ground ball into the outfield. I need to watch my timing on the curveball. I made it all the way around the bases as the team went on a great run at the plate.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> I hit a flyout in the third to left field. I was just under it, but the power was there. I thought it had a chance, but oh well. I should practice my swing this week and ask Coach for some more tips.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> In the fourth inning, a new pitcher came into the game. Nobody knew her, so I think she must be a new recruit this season. She struck out Shirley in three pitches, which hasn’t happened since her first season with us. It was… </em>
</p><p>She stopped her pen. What was it? It was amazing, shocking, impressive as hell. She gripped the pen in her fist and pushed her hand into her forehead in frustration. </p><p>
<em> It was really surprising. I was up to bat next and thought I’d teach her a thing or two. I saw the first pitch clearly and let it sail by. The second one was close, but I knew it was another ball. I let my ego get the better of me and decided to give the pitcher an innocent wink. She made me pay for that. The next ball was aimed right at that eye.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> I charged at her like a bull towards a red cape. I was steaming. She had no right to do that. I pushed her, and even then, she still didn’t speak. Still couldn’t explain what her problem was. I don’t even know what her voice sounds like. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She picked the wrong gal to mess with. I’m going to make her regret that pitch.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Rio Vidal. Even her name makes me angry.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Rio Vidal. </em>
</p><p>
<em> I hate Rio Vidal. </em>

<blockquote>
<p>“The salaries being offered are good enough to assure the finest and fairest of talent. For instance, the lowest salary called for in a current contract is $45 a week, more than the average stenographer or factory girl gets. The best salary is $85 a week, comparing favorably with the pay received by players in the top minor leagues. And in usual baseball style the girls get all their expenses paid while they’re on the road.”</p>
<p>Gene F. Hampson, The Courier-News. May 25, 1943</p>
</blockquote><p>Agatha waited in the locker room for the game to finish. She laid down on the bench and listened to the announcer’s commentary that echoed throughout the stadium. </p><p>“And that’s another strikeout from the Sallie’s rookie pitcher, Rio Vidal, making it five for the night. What an arm, folks!”</p><p><em> Where did they find this girl? </em> Agatha had faced her share of talented hurlers during her years on the team. She had seen speed and accuracy before but not to this level. </p><p>Lefty Reyes on the Belles had dominated the mound for the first few years. Her pitches were nicknamed “rockets” because of their unhittable velocity. Then there was Grace Nickelson on the Peaches whose signature pitch was a riseball that could fool even the best hitter. However, both of these stars were underhand pitchers. Rio was an entirely different breed. </p><p>“Final score - Comets 5, Sallies 3. Give a hand to all the players, and we’ll see you tomorrow! Goodnight!”</p><p>The girls started trickling into the locker room now that the game had wrapped up. Agatha sat up, eager to hear the details. </p><p>“You’re still here?” The starting pitcher, Lupe Garcia, asked as she tossed her glove into her locker. </p><p>“Nowhere else to go.” Agatha said simply. </p><p>“Harkness!” The coach’s voice boomed as he entered the room. “Over here.” He pointed to the spare office. </p><p>She didn’t like the sound of this but knew the coach didn’t tolerate lollygagging. She hurried over. </p><p>“Sit.” He nodded to the foldable chair and shut the door. </p><p>“Coach, I-” </p><p>“I don’t want to hear any excuses. You’re lucky that the umpire likes you. If any other gal had pushed another player, they would be out for the week or worse. What were you thinking?”</p><p>Agatha rubbed her forehead, “I wasn’t. I’m sorry, Coach. She got the better of me. I won’t let it happen again.”</p><p>“It better not. This is your only warning. Step out of line again, and you’ll be riding the bench. I’m sure Terry would love to get some playtime as catcher.”</p><p>“Terry couldn’t catch a cold if someone coughed in her face.” Agatha remarked. </p><p>The coach glared back at her, “Hey, playing on this team is a privilege. Do you know how many girls would kill to have your spot?”</p><p>Agatha thought back to the open tryouts at Wrigley Field in 1943. </p><p>She had received a telegram from the office of Mr. Wrigley. </p><p>
<em> You are invited to try-out for the newly-created All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Please report to Wrigley Field on May 5, 1943. Equipment not provided.  </em>
</p><p>The house had been empty. She had simply stared at the small slip of paper in disbelief. Was this a goof? Was it a cruel joke? How did they even know who she was?</p><p>While the questions bounced around her brain, her mouth broke out into a smile. She hadn’t even realized she was doing it, but the idea of playing professional ball…how could she not? </p><p>She looked up and around the room, expecting Ralph to round the corner any second, expecting Nicky to race towards her and jump for joy at the news. But they wouldn’t. They couldn’t. </p><p>They were both gone. They weren’t coming back. </p><p>She spotted one of Nicky’s race car toys in the corner of the dining room. She stood from the chair and went to grab it. She must have missed it. It had only been a few months. She put it on the table, looking at the little painted details. He used to obsess over the different models and beg each birthday for a new one. She pushed it and watched the car soar to the ground and flip over. </p><p>Agatha sat in a daze, the memory overwhelming her for a moment. She stood up, went to the kitchen, and grabbed the phone. She spun the dial quickly as the pattern was well worn in her mind. </p><p>“Peggy?”</p><p>“Hey, doll. How are you?”</p><p>“Fine. I just got a very curious telegram.” Agatha said and wished she had brought it over to the phone. </p><p>“Holy mackerel! I was about to call to tell you the same. It’s from that gum man, Wrigley!” </p><p>Agatha gasped, “Yes! Mine too! Do you think it’s the real deal?”</p><p>“It must be. Chicago is a long way away. We’ve only got two weeks, you’re going right?” Peggy’s enthusiasm was bursting through the earpiece. </p><p>“I don’t know, Peg. My mother has been unwell, Ralph has enlisted, there’s nobody to look after the house, and what would I tell work?”</p><p>“Well, I’m going. When are we ever going to get a chance like this again? The try-outs are on the actual field that the Cubs play on! I’m going to tell the boss that I have to go to my great aunt’s funeral in Chicago. If I make the team, I’ll think of some other excuse. Don’t make me go alone!”</p><p>“You’re terrible. Let me think about it. I’ll ring you tomorrow.” They exchanged goodbyes, and Agatha went to the living room to collapse on the sofa. </p><p>“Ow.” She shifted to the side and rummaged under the cushion. She pulled out three army men that must have fallen down the cracks. Her eyes welled with tears, and she released a devastating sob. Her hands rubbed the green figurines and the wet streaks cut a river down her face. </p><p>
<em> I need to get out of here. I can’t live in a constant reminder.  </em>
</p><p>Agatha decided then and there to take the chance and booked a one-way ticket to Chicago alongside her co-worker and friend, Peggy Carter. The two of them were star players on the Salem Steelers, the company softball team where they played and worked. A scout had spotted them at one of the city league games and put them on the list with a few others from town. </p><p>Of the 280 women who tried out for the inaugural season of the league, only 60 were chosen on the four original teams to play. Against all odds and chance, both Agatha and Peggy made the roster for the Kenosha Comets. Their professional career had begun.  </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“I know, Coach. I’m sorry. It’s just that pitcher-”</p><p>“Nope, no excuses. I don’t care if she insulted your hairdo or called your mama a low-life nothing. There is no reason to resort to violence, got it?”</p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p>“Next practice you’re going to run the field until I say stop. And you’re going to write that girl an apology.”</p><p>Agatha jumped to her feet, “Sir! You can’t be serious.”</p><p>He stared at her, “Do I look like I’m joking? We’re done here. I expect you to hand me that letter by tomorrow. Have a good night, Harkness.”</p><p>Before she could protest again, she was shown the door. </p><p>Wanda met her and led her to her bags, “Come on, the bus is outside. Let’s get out of here.”</p><p>Agatha was too enraged to open her mouth, for fear of what might come out. She let Wanda hand her the bag of her things and followed the team to the bus that would take them back to the hotel. She sat in the back as usual. </p><p>“Sooo….do you want to talk about it?” Wanda prodded. </p><p>Agatha’s mouth was a tight line. She shook her head. </p><p>“Okay then. If it makes you feel any better, I got a hit off that pitcher. It was a lucky single, but I got on base. We just need to practice against an overhand pitcher more. I think we need more time. She’s not unhittable.” </p><p>“Where are we going to find someone who can throw at her speed? Lupe is great but more of a breaking ball gal. We need a pitcher who can match that crazy fastball.” Agatha said. </p><p>“I’ll ask Coach. I know the scouts are searching far and wide for overhand pitchers. There may be some more mid-season recruits coming for all we know.” </p><p>Shirley sat up and turned around to face them over the seats, “Did you guys hear about that broad from Hong Kong? I heard Coach saying that a scout saw her play in California and that she had one of the fastest arms he had ever seen.” </p><p>“Do you really think the league would give her a shot? Maxine from my hometown team could probably make the Red Sox starting lineup with her level of talent, but she couldn’t even get a try out because of the color of her skin.” Agatha was well aware of the color barrier in place in the league. It was a wonder that they let several Cuban and Puerto Rican girls play at all. Then again, hypocrisy and racism generally went hand in hand.  </p><p>“Who knows? With all these new teams and new rules, they are desperate for new players. The war’s over, the men are back. It’s only a matter of time before they push us out. Why not let some chick from the Far East join the downfall?” Shriley was a realist, if nothing else. Her neurotic anxiety kept her optimism low. She had no delusions about the long-term future of the sport. </p><p>“Who peed in your porridge? The stands are still packed at all our games, the paychecks are still clearing, let’s just enjoy this moment!” Wanda chimed in. She was beyond grateful for her position on the Comets. It paid more than her father made, let her travel with her sons, and allowed her to do what she loved. </p><p>“At least Rio probably won’t be playing tomorrow. She’ll need to rest her arm after all those innings. We should discuss with Coach a game plan though.” Agatha said.</p><p>“Off to bed everyone! Game starts tomorrow at noon, so the bus leaves at 10:30am. Remember to get your beauty sleep.” The team chaperone, Lilia, announced. </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. She didn’t need beauty sleep. She needed a drink. </p><p>Peggy hopped up and whispered to the group in the back as everyone rustled to get up and out, “We’re walking over to The Sidewinder downtown. Once the lights go out at 10, be ready to roll.”</p><p>Agatha rubbed her hands together and grinned, “Perfect, I need this.” </p><p>They grabbed their stuff and filed into the hotel. It was a nice place in a quiet neighborhood, nothing fancy but neat and tidy. Agatha and Peggy were roommates on the road and back in their home city of Kenosha. </p><p>“Do you think there will be any airmen at this joint?” Peggy opened her suitcase and searched for her favorite dress.</p><p>“Doubtful. When’s the last time we saw any flyboys? They’ve probably been discharged already and are back with their wives.” Agatha sat at the small wooden desk in the room and carefully ripped out a page from her journal. </p><p>“Boo, I’m glad the war is behind us, but I’ll sure miss those servicemen. They knew a thing or two about pleasing a woman.” </p><p>Agatha put her hands over her ears, “Lalalalalala. I don’t want to hear any of that.”</p><p>“Oh, you prude! You could clean up if you’d just open up a bit. The guys are always begging to dance with you.”</p><p>“I’m just…not interested. I want to focus on the game. Is that so wrong?”</p><p>“A girl deserves a little fun now and then. Was Ralph the last bloke you were with? It’s been over five years, Angel.” Peggy looked at her with a mix of pity and concern. </p><p>“I’m fine! I just haven’t seen anyone that looks interesting. I don’t want to be stuck in another marriage of convenience with some guy who doesn’t speak his mind, who expects me to do everything. Who would want to be with a divorcée anyway? They’d probably run for the hills if they heard that.”</p><p>“You’re gorgeous, my friend. Any man would be lucky to have you. Let’s see what’s on the menu tonight. Promise me, you’ll at least look.”</p><p>“I have to write this letter first. If I can’t get this out, I’m not going at all.” Agatha turned back to face the paper and pen. </p><p>“Don’t be silly. Just say you’re sorry. It’s not that hard! I’m going to go take a shower, get writing!” Peggy grabbed her towel and washkit, then closed the door. </p><p>Agatha leaned against her elbows on the desk. <em> Just start. You heard Peggy, it’s easy. </em>She picked up the pen. </p><p>
<em> Dear Rio,  </em>
</p><p>She stared at the paper. What she wanted to write was: <em> How dare you? If you try that nonsense again, I’ll do much worse than a pathetic push. You’re lucky that I was held back. I can’t wait to wipe that smug smile off your face.  </em></p><p>She knew better than to try to cross Coach. She tried again. </p><p>
<em> Dear Rio,  </em>
</p><p>
<em> I deeply apologize for my actions at our last game. I let my emotions get the better of me, and I should have remained calm. I was upset at the pitch you threw, but I should not have charged you. If you pitch in the strike zone next time, we won’t have a problem.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> I hope you will forgive me. I am very sorry.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Sincerely,  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Agatha Harkness </em>
</p><p>There. Done. She found a spare envelope in her bag and sealed the letter inside. She wrote Rio’s name on the front and put it with her equipment. </p><p>Peggy came back in a few minutes later, looking as fresh and dewey as ever. “What are you wearing tonight? Do you want to borrow one of my dresses?” </p><p>“What’s wrong with my clothes?” Agatha held up one of her usual getups. </p><p>“Nothing, nothing. It’s just…they say ‘old maid’ rather than ‘on the market’, if you catch my drift.”</p><p>Agatha put a hand in front of her mouth, feigning hurt. “Fine, you’ve caught me on a weak night. I’m your doll. Dress me up.” </p><p>Peggy didn’t have to do much. Agatha was stunning, but she tended to hide behind modest attire and subdued makeup. </p><p>“Final touches. Pout your lips.” Peggy swiped a bold red lipstick across her lips. It was a few shades darker than the standard issue one they had to wear at every game. </p><p>Agatha looked at herself in the full-length mirror in the room. Her eyes widened, and she spun around to take in the full effect. </p><p>“Hmmmm…not bad.”</p><p>“Not bad? That’s the thanks I get? I’d jump your bones if you’d let me.” Peggy exclaimed. </p><p>Agatha swatted her lightly, “Thanks, Peg. I owe you.”</p><p>Peggy checked her watch, “I know. I’m keeping a tally, by the way. We’ve got ten minutes. Let’s go.”</p><p>They carefully snuck down the stairs, and other gals joined their quiet parade out of the hotel. Not everyone joined as some were tired, some didn’t approve, some had other plans. But Peggy, Agatha, Wanda, Lupe, Dottie, and Rose all broke free into the warm night. </p><p>It was explicitly prohibited for players to drink or smoke in public places, but a girl’s gotta have a little fun now and then. The veterans knew how to avoid the prying eyes of the chaperones and coaches and cut loose on occasion.  </p><p>“Jeepers, Angel! Are you on the prowl tonight? You look amazing.” Lupe whistled as she took in Agatha’s full transformation. </p><p>“Peggy wanted to give me a makeover.” Agatha shrugged but couldn’t hide her smile. </p><p>“You’re going to wish you brought your bat. The guys are going to be rushing to get your dance card.” Wanda laughed. </p><p>It only took about fifteen minutes to get to the bar. “How’d you hear about this place, Peggy?” Agatha asked. </p><p>“One of the spectators gave me a matchbook from here. Said they serve cheap drinks to pretty tourists.” She tossed her hair and batted her eyelashes. </p><p>She opened the door, and they were immediately hit with the noise of a jukebox blaring. The place was almost overflowing with people. </p><p>“Wow, popular spot.” Lupe observed and immediately beelined to the bar. The rest followed. </p><p>The bartender, a well-dressed gentleman in his 40s, nodded to them. “A Manhattan, please.” Agatha ordered. </p><p>“Hey, isn’t that…” Wanda pointed over across the room where several of the Sallies’ players were sitting and drinking their cocktails. </p><p>Agatha looked and her eyes immediately found the person who had been occupying 80% of all her thoughts for the last several hours. Rio was sipping on a beer bottle and smiling at something that one of the other girls just said. Agatha’s hands were unconsciously squeezing into fists. </p><p>“Excuse me. Care for a dance?” A young man tapped Agatha on the shoulder, and she snapped out of her anger. He was tall, clean cut with cropped blonde hair. Probably six or seven years younger than her but looked harmless. </p><p>“Sure. Wanda, hold my drink.” She passed her glass over and took the outstretched hand. He led her to the dance floor in the middle of the space. </p><p>Duke Ellington was playing. He led them through a classic two-step. “Name’s Frank.”</p><p>“Agatha.” </p><p>They made their way around the floor. He was a decent dancer and Agatha was no dead hoofer either. She had always loved to move. As they spun, Agatha felt a strange sensation. Like someone was watching her. She tried to ignore it. Tried to focus on the music, the steps, this man, but it became impossible to ignore. </p><p>Her eyes tracked along the bar. Nothing. Along the other dancers. No. </p><p>To the tables of patrons. There. </p><p>Sitting alone now, gripping her beer bottle like it was daring to run, and shooting daggers straight in her direction. </p><p>
<em> Rio Vidal. </em>
</p><p>Agatha watched to see if maybe she was imagining it, but as her partner led them up and down the floor, Rio’s eyes followed. </p><p>“What’s her deal?” Agatha muttered aloud on accident. </p><p>“Huh?” Frank leaned back in confusion. </p><p>“Sorry, nothing.” They kept swaying to the tune but she felt an energy building inside. “Actually, give me one second. I’ll be right back.” </p><p>Agatha crossed the room in just six long strides. </p><p>She slammed her hands onto the table in front of Rio. “Why are you staring at me?”</p><p>The pitcher took a slow drink from her bottle and never broke eye contact. She leaned back. </p><p>“Don’t you dare shrug at me again! Say something!” Agatha’s patience was waning. She couldn’t understand what was going on. </p><p>“I like your dress.” Her voice was deeper than she was expecting with a subtle hint of sarcasm like she might be telling the truth or might be lying through her teeth. </p><p>“You…wait, what?” Agatha’s frustration turned to surprise. She felt her cheeks start to warm involuntarily. </p><p>“You look nice.” Rio spoke again as if it was the most obvious statement in the world. Agatha stared back in disbelief. </p><p>Wanda ran up, having spotted them from the bar. “Agatha, come on. I don’t think you should be over here.”</p><p>Agatha felt herself being pulled away quickly before she could even respond.<em> She likes my dress? </em>“Wait, Wanda-”</p><p>“What are you thinking? Have you lost your head again? You know we’re not meant to fraternize with any other teams! We could get fined if anyone reports you.” Wanda gave her back her drink and sat down on one of the barstools, looking around erratically to see if anyone saw. </p><p>“Did you see the way she was staring at me? I could hardly focus on the music. I could feel her eyes tracking me like prey. It was unnerving!” Agatha downed her drink in one go. </p><p>“Woah there, tiger. Don’t forget we still have a game tomorrow. She’s just trying to get in your head. Probably upset that we beat them.” </p><p>“You good, babe?” Peggy stumbled over after finishing her gallop around the dancefloor with a young gentleman. </p><p>“Yeah, I think I might head back soon.” Agatha said. </p><p>“Awwww, don’t be a drip!” Peggy jested with her and put her hand up to get the bartender’s attention. She ordered three shots of whiskey. They both clinked their glasses and put the drink away fast. </p><p>Wanda declined hers, so Agatha and Peggy shot back half each. “You two are crazy. I’m going to go back and check on the twins. Don’t stay out all night!”</p><p>“Anyone catch your eye? How was that blonde guy that you were dancing with?” Peggy probed. </p><p>Agatha had forgotten about him already. Her mind was still reeling from Rio. <em> How could one person be so disarming? What was it about this woman that made her feel like this? </em></p><p>“Agatha?” Peggy pushed as she hadn’t answered. </p><p>“Sorry, no. I don’t see anyone worthwhile. I’m going to see if I can catch up with Wanda, sorry Pegs!” She took off out the bar doors, suddenly feeling very closed in and claustrophobic.  </p><p>“Oh well, more for me.” Peggy looked around the room for her next suitor. </p><p>Agatha practically threw herself out of the door and felt immediate relief at the warm summer night’s air. She didn’t realize how suffocating the bar was with the combination of hot dancing bodies, cigarette smoke, and the strong tang of alcohol. </p><p>She couldn’t see Wanda, but it was very dark out and the streetlamps barely provided any illumination. She decided to walk back alone. </p><p>Her mind went to the one place she was trying to avoid. <em> Why did Rio say she liked my dress? She must be trying to rattle me.  </em></p><p>
<em> Well, it’s working.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> No, it’s not.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Ummm, yes it is.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Stop thinking about her.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> I can’t. </em>
</p><p>
<em> You have to.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Why don’t you stop thinking about her? </em>
</p><p>
<em> I’m you. We’re we. </em>
</p><p>
<em> We need to stop thinking about her! </em>
</p><p>Agatha let out a loud groan as she fought herself in her mind and realized she probably looked insane. She looked around and over her shoulder but was still alone on the street. Luckily (hopefully) nobody had heard her or seen her. </p><p>
<em> We’re fine. We’re fine.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Ugh, no I mean, I’m fine!  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Must be that last shot of whiskey. I think I’m just tired. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Maybe a good night’s sleep is all I need…as long as I don’t dream about her.  </em>

</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha woke up to the door opening and closing quickly. She blearily opened her eyes to see Peggy tip-toeing in wearing the same clothes from last night. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good night?” She rasped out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy removed her heels and fell back on her single bed. “Nothing special. I’ll give it a 4/10. And that might be generous”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That bad?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He was enthusiastic, but it was also perhaps the quickest seven minutes of my life.” Peggy cracked up and Agatha joined in, both of them giggling on their beds.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What time is it?” Agatha clumsily reached for her watch. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just after 8. I’m going to try to get another hour of shut eye.” Peggy stripped off her dress and shimmied under the covers in just a slip. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going to get breakfast while I can. Do you want me to bring you anything?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A muffin if they have any.” Peggy spoke with her eyes still closed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha threw on a casual skirt and blouse, then hurried downstairs to the hotel dining room. The rest of the team was already seated and eating the provided breakfast. She took a free chair next to Wanda. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Billy, eat your eggs. Leave Tommy’s plate alone.” She scolded her son who was more interested in his brother’s food. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom! I want some more bacon!” Billy whined. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Here, kid.” Agatha picked up her spare piece with her fork and deposited it on the boy’s plate. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks, Aunty Aggie.” He grinned and grabbed the crispy piece with his hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Use a fork!” Wanda admonished him with a sigh. “These kids, I swear.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you ready for today?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course, you?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m always ready.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda lowered her voice, “What time did Peggy crawl in?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“A few minutes ago.” Agatha chuckled, “She’ll be ready.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She better be. We don’t want to have Helen at shortstop again. Remember last time Peggy was sick? I think a scarecrow could have stopped more balls than Helen.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ladies!” Lilia walked in and drew their attention immediately, “remember to look your best today. We got a new shipment of makeup, so if anyone needs a new tube of lipstick or eyeliner, come see me. Iron your uniforms before we go. If you would like a lucky crystal, I have a few spares.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There she goes again with the crystals.” Agatha muttered under her breath to Wanda, who covered her mouth to stifle her laughter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She means well. Tommy, chew with your mouth closed, dear.” Wanda said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Bus is waiting out front. I expect you all lined up and ready soon. Coach said the batting lineup is the same as yesterday. Lois is the starting pitcher. Agatha is back in at catcher. Rest remains the same. Dismissed.” Lilia turned and headed outside to talk with the driver. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The chaperone had been with the Comets since the beginning. Lilia was a widower from the Great War and had previously worked as a nurse in a public hospital. She was a healer at heart and deeply spiritual, but her aloof exterior often put people off. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her bag was a thing of legend among the players. Somehow, she always seemed to have exactly what they needed. Chamomile extracts for sliding wounds, ginger for upset stomachs, dressings and bandages, arnica for bruises, and a cheeky flask of whiskey to calm the nerves. She suffered no fools, but she cared about these players like they were her own children. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia never had her own kids. She loved her husband, but she couldn’t envision a future where the two of them raised anything besides hell. When he died, she moved on from that once held dream. She kept her career at the Milwaukee General Hospital and lived a fairly solitary existence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was pure chance that one of the doctors approached her one day and asked if she had any interest in baseball. She liked it well enough and attended a few Milwaukee Creams games, the local minor league team. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re starting up a ladies league all over the Midwest.” He explained. “My daughter was contacted by a scout who saw her playing in the local softball circuit. Apparently they are searching for talent all over the country!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow, she must be a real ace. Girls playing ball…I’ve never heard of such a thing.” Lilia said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, they are also looking for women to work as chaperones on the teams. There are going to be a lot of young girls, and I think they want some guardrails in place. I play golf with one of the managers, I could put in a good word, if you’re interested.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do I know about chaperoning some baseball players?” Lilia scoffed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I would hate to lose you. You’re one of the most competent nurses on the night shift, but if I may be frank, you don’t seem particularly happy here.” The doctor looked at her sadly. Lilia didn’t realize anyone paid her any mind, that anyone saw her at all. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you really think they would consider a kooky old broad? I don’t know if I have much to offer…” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll talk to Max and put your name forward. The pay is decent, they’ll pay for travel and meals, and you’ll get to see more of the country. I hope you consider it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The offer and contract arrived via a large manila envelope to her home. She accepted immediately, rented out her home, and moved down to Kenosha. It had been an adjustment to say the least, but as she got to know all the players, listened to their stories, and got to know them, she had to admit - she loved it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The girls finished their meal and went to get ready. Agatha grabbed a spare blueberry muffin for Peggy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wake up, sunshine!” She called out as she entered their shared room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy groaned, “Is it that time already?” Agatha tossed over the muffin which she caught effortlessly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eat your breakfast and get dressed. Time to play.” Agatha checked her uniform and saw it was still extremely clean as she hadn’t had much chance to dirty it yesterday. She dusted some stray specks off her green cap. She folded the dress and put it in her bag. She then applied her makeup as she was taught during Charm School those first two years of the league. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She still remembered those classes so clearly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ladies, ladies. You will not be allowed on the field without a proper face of make-up, so I suggest you listen up!” The instructor was a beautiful woman in her 50’s that had looked like she would rather be anywhere else.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought we were here to play baseball, not pose for a magazine cover…” Peggy whispered to Agatha which elicited a snort. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Something funny?” The woman had raised her brow at the two women sitting in the back, who both shook their heads. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right, now remember, there are two eyebrows, not one. If you keep your face in order, you’ll be able to perform well for the fans. They are here to see women play ball, not scrappy tomboys.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>In addition to make-up tips, they were taught proper manners and etiquette. They were shown how to elegantly walk up and down stairs, how to walk in heels, how to drink tea with their pinkies out, how to properly cross their legs when sitting, everything the league thought was becoming of a lady. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Most of the players rolled their eyes at the lessons, but the subtext was clear. Anyone who looked or acted like a man, anyone who could be accused of being queer, was not welcome here. No short hair, no smoking or drinking in public, no pants, no swearing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy and Agatha finished getting ready and threw their bags on their back and took the stairs quickly. Everyone was in a line for the bus. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nice of you to join us, you two.” Lilia said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Apologies, ma’am.” Peggy uttered as they stepped aboard. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The ride passed without drama, and they were at the stadium in no time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s warm up. Get changed and meet me on the field.” Coach Grant looked excited this morning. The team was on a winning streak. It was their best start ever, and he wanted to keep the momentum going. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha put on her uniform then started fastening on her catcher’s gear. First the leg protectors, then her chest guard, and finally her mask. She always felt like a turtle in all her gear. It was her armor against the world. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ready, Flo?” She called out to Lois Florentine, the starting pitcher today. She had joined last season and had a really impressive curveball. What she lacked in speed, she more than made up for in accuracy.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yup, I’m ready.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>They walked together to the warm-up mounds along the first base side. The seats were slowly starting to fill up with fans. Agatha stood behind the line while Lois took to her spot. She tossed a few regular throws over to warm up her arm. Agatha threw them back gingerly as well. Then she crouched in position and threw up her glove, ready to take the real practice throws. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“A bit too far inside.” She called out as one of the curveballs missed the zone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Got it!” Lois said back and re-adjusted her grip. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The next ball flew right into her glove, perfect placement. “Nice one!” She remarked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glanced over to the other side of the field where the opposing team pitcher was warming up. No sign of Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lois threw for a while longer until they were called back to the locker room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright Comets, we’ve got a great chance to pull out a win today. We beat these gals yesterday, and I think we have it in us to do it again. Just stay focussed and remember the basics. Make the easy play, don’t try to be a hero, and stay calm. We’ve been swinging the bat well, so keep it up. It looks like their starting pitcher is Evie Risinger. She has a mean change-up, but if you keep your eye on the ball, it shouldn’t be an issue. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Look to me for any signals when you’re up to bat or on base. I believe in this team. Let’s show ‘em what we got!” He extended his hand and everyone piled their hands on top of each other. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy led the chant, “Win on three! One, two, three.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“WIN!” They all shouted in unison and raised their hands together. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They started to walk out to the dugout, but Agatha heard the coach call her back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you do what I asked?” He asked her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She went to her bag and grabbed the envelope. “Here. I didn’t see the pitcher out there earlier. Can you give it to their coach when you go to talk to the umpire?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He took it from her and nodded, “Glad to have you back. Don’t make this a habit.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aye, aye, cap.” Agatha went to join the team out on the field as the opposition was hitting first. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“All good?” Wanda said in a low voice before heading to her position.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just fine, Little Red. Let’s have a good game.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sheepishly greeted the home plate umpire as she took her spot behind the plate and started tossing the ball with Lois, “Hiya Rich. Sorry about yesterday.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Harkness. I’m keeping a close eye on you. Don’t test me.” He warned before donning his own mask. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Me? Well, I never!” She replied, which got a laugh out of him. The first batter from The Sallies stepped up into the box. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a quick 1,2,3 inning as the defense was solid. The next few innings were much of the same. Neither team could produce anything exciting. The pitching on both sides was great. Agatha got on base in the third but was left stranded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The entire time, she kept her eyes on the opposing team’s bullpen, waiting to see the relief pitchers warming up. Would Rio come in again? Did she have a rest day today?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t see her sitting on the bench. </span>
<em>
<span>Maybe she’s off. </span>
</em>
<span>Teams often rotated their pitchers to allow their arms to rest and recover. Overhand pitching was incredibly stressful on the joints compared to underhand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>By the sixth inning, there was no sign of the dark and stormy pitcher. Agatha felt the tension release from her shoulders. Esther Jones came in instead. She had been in the league since the beginning. Agatha remembered her from the try-outs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Originally, a center fielder Esther had a rocket of an arm and could throw from the back wall all the way to second base on a good day. The coach had begged her to switch to pitching this year and helped train her. She lacked confidence on the mound, but when she was in the zone, good luck getting a hit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was up. She kicked her feet in the dirt and took her stance. She lifted the bat from her shoulder and trained her eyes on the pitcher. There was nowhere on Earth where she felt more in control and yet completely on edge as the batter’s box. It was an intoxicating high. It could end in euphoria or heartbreak, and it was all up to you - whether you could read the pitcher, whether you could swing in time, whether you could connect.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a pressure cooker, and she lived for it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She let the first pitch go by. A strike but low and inside. She hated those. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lost your edge, Angel?” The opposing catcher, Carson, spoke lowly as she stood and threw the ball back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ignored it. Heckling by the catcher was expected. She was a master at it so couldn’t complain. She dug in again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The ball was coming right down the middle. </span>
<em>
<span>Bingo. </span>
</em>
<span>She twisted her hips and allowed the momentum to carry the wooden bat down and across the plate. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Going, going…not quite gone. It landed in the gap between right and center field. Agatha took off like a bullet towards first base. She watched the ball roll to the fence - she could make it to second if she hustled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She stood up on second to the roaring cheers of the crowd. A quality double. She clapped her hands as the adrenaline pumped through her. Her breath was coming heavy and fast after that sprint, but she had to immediately get ready to run again as Fern was up next. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her eyes went to the opposing team's dugout where she thought she saw a flash of brown hair turn and retreat out. But the pitcher was already throwing out the next toss. </span>
<em>
<span>Come on, head in the game. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scored on a hard-hit single to the outfield by the next batter, and the team won the game by two runs. The Comets were now ahead in the series and adding to their win total. There were still two more months of regular season games before the playoffs, but they were all hoping to qualify after missing out for the last three years. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Coach Grant addressed them all as they sat in the dugout, “Great game today everyone! That’s what I want to see out there. The defense was impenetrable, and there were some great plays from both infield and outfield. Let’s meet at the park across from the hotel at 5 for some batting practice. I would like to increase our on-base percentage, we should be scoring more runs. See you then.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>They all got changed, got back on the bus, and headed to their temporary road home. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Great arm today, Flo.” Wanda tapped the starting pitcher on the arm. She was sitting a few rows in front. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks, Red. I was nervous as usual, but the Sallies still seem very green. I was worried when Shaw came up, but it makes it so much easier having you all behind me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Keep throwing like you did, and you won’t even need us. You’ll be striking them left and right!” Wanda smiled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aw shucks, don’t embarrass me!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, where’s my compliments? What’s a pitcher without a talented catcher?” Agatha jumped into the conversation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry, yes tell us more about how challenging it is to crouch in a single spot and catch a ball?” Peggy always took a chance to razz Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Fossey turned around and added her two cents, “Spend a day in the outfield, Angel. Then tell us which position is tougher!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ummmm, the infield gets the most action. We have to constantly be aware and ready to react.” Peggy replied. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You certainly know all about getting action…” Agatha murmured out, which earned her a swift smack on the head from the magazine Peggy was holding. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Every position is important and challenging in its own unique ways.” Wanda tried to placate the growing arguments brewing at the back of the bus. Her practice with the twins came in handy even with adults.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure, but can y’all admit that first base is the most pressure?” Dottie Simpson threw her perspective into the ring. The charming Southern belle could never watch a discussion pass her by. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you kidding? Pitchers have the entire weight of the team on our shoulders! The game doesn’t start or stop without us. The win or loss is recorded next to our name.” Flo reignited the debate, and the players continued to bicker for the rest of the ride. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They reached the hotel, and everyone headed in. Some decided to take a nap before practice, others read in their rooms, some ran to town for some errands. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fancy a smoke?” Peggy nudged Agatha while holding up her pack of Lucky Strikes. Agatha followed her out to the back porch where they took up seats on the worn deck chairs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy pulled out her cherished metal Zippo lighter. It had a plane embossed on one side. She had been given it a few years back by a handsome soldier who had just returned from Germany. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whatever happened to that fella?” Agatha asked as she watched Peggy rubbing her thumb along the lighter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Steve?” Peggy looked up and snapped out of whatever memory she had been in. “I never heard from him again. I gave him my address in Salem, but he never wrote. I thought…well doesn’t matter now anyway.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She passed a cigarette over and gracefully lit her own then handed the lighter across. The two friends sat in a comfortable silence for a few minutes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you want to get married?” Agatha broke the spell. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure. If the right guy asked, why not?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about Fred?” Agatha knew about Peggy’s previous engagement to Fred Wells that had been called off. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She took a long drag and blew out an impressive cloud, “He wasn’t the right guy.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Was it because he didn’t want you to play ball?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was a big part of it. I don’t want to be with a man who can’t respect my dreams, my desires. Do you think you’ll get married again?” Peggy stared out into the distance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t imagine a man that could handle me. Ralph was a mistake. A hasty choice to try to escape my mother’s clutches. I haven’t met any man who didn’t look at me like I was some…foregone conclusion. Not a person with my own thoughts and feelings, just another box for them to tick in their life goals. I have my own life. I don’t want to give it up to be some doting housewife.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wouldn’t mind being an old spinster with you. We could move to the big city, Boston. We could get an apartment near Fenway and get season tickets. I could try to become a detective. You could go to college.” Peggy tapped out some ash into the glass tray on the table beside them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t go getting a gal’s hopes up. That sounds pretty swell to me.” Agatha took another slow pull of smoke and smiled at Peggy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy dropped the simmering butt and held out her hand. Agatha cocked an eyebrow but decided to humor her and shook it firmly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going to hold you to that. If we’re both still single when we turn 40, we’re moving in together.” Peggy declared as she still held Agatha’s hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Deal. Let’s be real though, you’ll probably be married to some rich suitor by the end of the season.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No takebacks! You shook on it.” Peggy stood up and stretched her back. She rolled her shoulders to relax. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I never go back on a promise.” Agatha crossed her heart with her finger and also stood. She kicked her legs back to get the blood flowing. Crouching behind home plate for such long stretches was tough on her lower leg muscles. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grabbed the newspaper from the lobby and went to relax in their room for a bit. Before long, they were all headed back out to the local park across the street to work on their batting. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Remember to stay loose. When you tighten up on the bat, your reaction time gets worse. You want to be able to see the ball and immediately decide whether to swing or not. Keep your posture balanced and your head steady. When the right pitch comes your way, keep your bat level to try to meet the ball squarely.” Coach Grant tried his best to impart his batting wisdom on the players. They had a spare glove on the grass as the stand-in home plate, and he was demonstrating his stance and positioning for them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They each took turns practicing their swings and stances. He would make small adjustments to their arms, their grip, their feet. There were so many more mechanics to baseball than most realized. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Coach started throwing some pitches to practice actually hitting. After a few rounds, Agatha spoke up, “Can you throw us the heat, Coach? We need to be ready for that Sallies’ pitcher. She’s gotta be the fastest in the league.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He wasn’t a pitcher but had a strong arm and excellent accuracy. “Good point, Angel. Timing is the most important thing to remember with fast pitchers. When you’re on deck, start watching and timing out when to swing. When you’re expecting it, you can be on the front foot and ready to smash it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took two strikes and two balls before she finally connected and sent a ball flying. She did it three more times and felt her confidence growing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Next time she faced Rio, she was going to be ready. </span>

<blockquote>
<p>
<span>“Each player who steps up to the plate will be as trim as a ballet dancer in her short-skirted pastel uniform. Every curl will be in place, her lipstick on precisely, and a tsk! tsk! to the girl who hits a homer while her face is shiny.”</span>
</p>
<p>

</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha woke up early on Monday even though their third game wasn’t until 6pm that night. As part of the league rules, they played each team four times before moving on to the next series. It helped draw fans from the local area and reduced the constant travel by allowing them longer stretches in each city. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked over at Peggy who was still fast asleep. Even in her slumber, she looked like a movie star. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She felt an excessive amount of energy and nerves building in her. She grabbed her sneakers and changed into her tan gymsuit. She crossed the road and started jogging around the park. There was a paved sidewalk around the entire perimeter. Her shoes beat against the hard ground in a satisfying rhythm. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was early morning, but the summer heat was already rearing its ugly head. She felt sweat starting to form all over her body, but the pleasant hum of exertion was pulsing through her veins. She welcomed the distraction from her obsessive thoughts about the game tonight that had been running on a loop since she woke up </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Will Rio be pitching? Will she try to hit me again? What will I do if she does? Why did she stare at me at the bar that night? Why did she compliment me? Where did she come from? Why did she throw a ball at my head? Where did she learn to pitch so fast? Why did she join the league now? Where had she been? </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The steady monotony of her jog pushed all those thoughts to the side. All she could think about was taking the next step, taking the next breath. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After thirty minutes of non-stop circles around the park, she finally slowed to a walk as she approached the water fountain. The lukewarm water had a bitter aftertaste like metal, but she was so thirsty she didn’t care. She went back to the hotel to take a shower. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jesus, is it raining outside? Why are you drenched?” Peggy was sitting at the vanity, brushing her hair. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I had too much on my mind. I went for a run.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“A run? Don’t you get enough exercise around the bases?” Peggy couldn’t imagine running outside of practice or a game. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want to make sure I’m ready for tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Worried about that pitcher? Surely she won’t try to bean you again. If she does, she’ll have to deal with both me and Wanda.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks Peg. She’d be crazy to try that stunt again.” Agatha grabbed her towel and went to wash up with a cold shower. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The day passed in a haze of preparation and distraction. Agatha found herself again in the locker room suiting up in her gear as Lupe was ready to warm up. She steeled herself as they entered the field. She glanced across the infield and saw Mickey Sosa getting ready. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Right, Rio is not a starter. She’ll come in later, if at all. </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha looked and couldn’t see Rio in the dugout yet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Mickey was talented. She used to play on the Lassies but got traded last year. A recruit from Cuba, she was only 20 years old but her sidearm was menacing. It was hard to read the trajectory of each pitch and when she added some spin, it was a hard lesson in timing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The anthem blared, the announcer started the game, things were underway. The first two innings were over with little action. No hits from either team. Agatha knocked a line drive straight to Greta at first base during her first at bat, which was disappointing, but she was just biding her time, waiting for her rematch with the pitcher who haunted her dreams. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Mickey was on a roll, and the Comets only had two hits when they reached the sixth inning. Agatha could see the strain on her face though as her pitch count increased. She was going to have to be pulled soon. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda was up and belted one into the gap over second base. She made it safely to first, and the Sallies manager came out to speak with Mickey. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Here we go. </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha watched the dugout and saw her. Rio grabbed her glove and hopped up from the bench. She didn’t walk. She swaggered out to the mound with all the confidence and moxie of a major leaguer. </span>
<em>
<span>God, she’s insufferable. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The umpire let her throw a few practice pitches out before Rose “Horsey” Horstman, their third baseman, stepped up. She was a power threat and looked ready. She was a native of Kenosha so had a huge hometown following. </span>
<em>
<span>Come on, Horsey. Wipe that smile off her face. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She fouled off the first pitch, swung at a ball, then struck out looking at a nasty change-up. Three pitches was all it took. Agatha saw the runaway glee on Rio’s face as she heard the umpire call that final strike. It’s like she was feeding on it - gaining power from the control. </span>
</p><p>
<span>One out. Peggy was up. “I’ll get her for you, Angel.” She blew a kiss and walked over. </span>
</p><p>
<span>First pitch was a strike that zipped by before Peggy could even swing. Agatha watched her shake her head and readjust her grip on the bat. Second pitch missed barely. Third pitch and Agatha heard the wooden crack of the bat as Peggy hit a grounder to short. McCready fielded it easily and tossed it across to Greta for an out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Start your bat almost as soon as the ball leaves her hand. It’s faster than you expect.” Peggy came and sat down beside Agatha. “You’d think with her ridiculous long wind-up, there would be time to see it coming.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks, I’ll get her.” Agatha grabbed her favorite bat. She went to the on-deck circle and watched Rio closely. Shirley was batting now. Agatha practiced her swing as Rio pitched and tried to adjust to her speed. Shirley lined one down the third base line and got onto first. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She’s just another pitcher. You’ve done this hundreds of times.</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha gave herself a pep talk then took her position next to home plate. Rio was watching her, taking in her every movement like she was cataloguing it for later. Agatha watched right back, intent on not being intimidated. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She spread her feet, brought her arms up, held her bat high, focussed. Rio took her time. She accepted the catcher’s call then stood up. The wind-up, the pitch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tried to stay loose. Tried not to tense up. She watched the ball leave Rio’s hand. It was barely a throw. It was a lob - way outside. </span>
<em>
<span>Is she intentionally walking me?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Ball.” The umpire yelled from behind her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Again, Agatha got set. Rio pitched. A slow throw far outside the zone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ball.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Carson got up from her position behind the plate and jogged out towards Rio. Agatha saw a look of confusion on her face. Rio was clearly not following the catcher’s signs. They had a hasty discussion, and Carson came back and extended her mitt again. Agatha got ready. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ball.” That was three balls, no strikes. One more and Rio will have granted Agatha a free pass to first base.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared out at the mound. Rio was looking straight at her. They held eye contact for what felt like minutes but was probably no more than five seconds. And this time, the edges of Rio’s lips lifted and she gifted Agatha a short, deliberate wink. A mirror of her own from their previous meeting. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her heart start to pound. She felt her nerves start to shimmer under her skin, her hands started to sweat against the grain of her bat. Rio’s arms went back over her head, her leg kicked out like a cheerleader, her throwing arm swung around. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The ball was a blur. “Strike.” </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh god. She did all that on purpose. She threw three balls just to prove that she can. Just to show she doesn’t need them. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The next ball looked like it was coming straight for Agatha’s waist. She held off and watched in horror as the ball broke and curved right into Shaw’s glove. “Strike.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>No, no, no! She can’t get away with this. She can’t make a fool out of me. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Full count!” The umpire’s voice echoed out from behind her. There were three balls, two strikes. It all came down to the payoff pitch. If it was a ball, she would get to walk to first base. If it was a strike, she was out. If she hit it, she could maybe show up Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I have to hit this. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She imagined the look on Rio’s face if she knocked the ball out of the park. She was so lost in her daydream that she missed the start of the pitcher’s wind-up. By the time she turned her attention to the incoming ball, it had already passed her by. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Strike! You’re out!” The fans in the stands roared their approval for their new star pitcher. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was frozen. She couldn’t move. She couldn’t digest this news. The Sallies were already running off the field to get ready for their turn at bat, and she was stuck standing in the box. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She watched Rio’s teammates patting her on the back as they laughed together. Agatha seethed. She turned and almost collided with Wanda. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you alright?” Wanda put a hand out to take the bat and reached out with her other hand to guide Agatha’s arm. </span>
</p><p><span>She couldn’t speak. What could she say? Rio had just humiliated her in front of everyone. Her eyes threatened her with tears that she pushed down. </span><em><span>Keep it together!</span></em> <em><span>There’s no crying in baseball! </span></em></p><p>
<span>Wanda helped Agatha get her catcher equipment on. She kneeled and fastened the leg guards on for her. Agatha still hadn’t said a word. </span>
<em>
<span>The audacity of that…of that…how could she….why did she…? </span>
</em>
<span>Words failed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Betty was on the bench this game. She was the team’s rookie back-up pitcher and outfielder. She watched Wanda ease the chest plate over Agatha’s head. “Bad luck, Angel. That pitcher really seems to have it out for you! I’ve never seen anyone do that before. To throw away three balls and then pummel you with three strikes. That’s psychological warfare.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah. Thanks Betty. Psychological warfare, gee that’s a good one. If she wants a war, she picked the wrong enemy.” Something hardened in Agatha then. If Rio was going to go low, then Agatha could go lower. She could dig a trench so deep that Rio would never see the light of day. She wasn’t going to simply roll over and take it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lupe was still pitching for the Comets. She had incredible stamina and could often last the entire game if the defense was at their best. Agatha caught her pitches with ease. They were a well-oiled machine, and Agatha knew all her quirks and preferences. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She favored her curveball but could only control it well in the first few innings. Her fastball was her secret weapon but couldn’t be thrown more than twice in a row. She wouldn’t ask for a slider unless the batter was jumpy and prone to swinging at anything. Agatha was one of the best catchers in the league for a reason. She could adapt to any pitcher. </span>
</p><p>
<span>On top of that, she had a strong arm that could throw out runners trying to steal, and she could catch long balls thrown home to tag out anyone trying to score. It was no fluke that she had made the all-star team for the last three years. She was popular with the papers, a favorite of the fans, and she relished the attention. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Being good at something, being good at this, made her feel alive, and for a long time she didn’t think that would ever happen again. Every team they beat was like a tonic to her soul. Every time she connected with the ball and saw the disappointment in the pitcher’s face, she felt like another year was added to her life. It was petty and some may say cruel or childish, but she loved it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She loved this game, and she was good at it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But out of nowhere, this rookie was blowing up her entire life. Rio Vidal had taken a sledgehammer to her beautiful baseball fantasy and was making her question if it was real at all. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was one out and a runner on second. For the first time in these three games, Rio was up to bat. Coaches generally put a pinch hitter, or a substitute, in for pitchers. Pitchers were often poor hitters because their entire focus was on their own craft. They didn’t have time for much else. But every player needed to hit at least once every few games to stay on the roster. Looks like Rio’s time was up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She approached the plate with the same cocky attitude that she seemed to move through the world with. </span>
<em>
<span>This should be interesting. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood straight up. No bend to her knees. The bat rested on her shoulder. She simply stood and stared at Lupe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you doing?” Agatha kept her voice quiet and spoke through her teeth. It was strictly against the rules for catchers to distract the batters but most umpires turned the other cheek.. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t acknowledge her, didn’t turn her head, didn’t move a muscle. Lupe’s eyes caught Agatha’s. She lowered her hands between her thighs and threw down two fingers and quickly moved her hand to the left - the signal for curveball, inside. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The pitcher nodded, acknowledging Agatha’s signal. Lupe had a long lunge and threw her curve. Agatha knew where it was going to hit, so she watched Rio out of the corner of her eye. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as the ball left Lupe’s hand, Rio loaded her swing and like a string being pulled back on a bow, she leaned back and swung her bat around with surprising energy. The ball launched between third base and the shortstop, and Rio took off. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Wow, she’s got some wheels. </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha watched Shirley throw the ball into second, and Rio stayed on first. </span>
<em>
<span>How can she hit too? What baseball factory was she built in?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Greta was up to bat. Agatha squatted down and made the next call for Lupe. She kept an eye on first though. Rio was taking a big lead off the base. </span>
<em>
<span>She’s not going to steal…is she?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>First pitch was a tidy strike. Rio was observing Lupe closely now. She took an extra step closer to second. Agatha saw the subtle move and indicated for a pitch out, a deliberate throw high and out of reach of the batter. Lupe nodded and the moment she started her wind-up, Rio bolted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had already jumped up to stand. She caught the ball and fired it off like a bullet from a gun. Lupe ducked and the ball shot across the field right into Wanda’s glove. She tagged the runner with a second to spare. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Out!” The infield umpire raised his fist. Rio’s mouth dropped open. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Gotcha. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t wipe the smile off her face. She did it. Finally, she had one up on Rio. She watched the runner jog to her dugout and decided to wave at her. Rio caught the gesture and looked away. She threw herself down on the bench and disappeared from Agatha’s view. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was the eighth inning when Agatha was back up to bat again. The score was still tied at zero. Her team needed her here. Peggy was on second base. If she could just get a hit to the outfield, Peggy had the speed to make it home.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched her approach the plate. She adjusted her cap, and Agatha watched her staring down at the ball in her glove. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Come on, give me something I can hit. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Ball.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ball.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Not this again.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Ball three.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha got ready. Fool me once and all that. She wasn’t going to let Rio pull this same stunt again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ball four. Take your base.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She walked me?! What? Why? </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tossed her bat, which Billy ran over to grab, before trotting over to first base. Rio didn’t look upset. She didn’t look surprised. She looked smug.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Fern was next in the line-up. Agatha and Peggy looked at each other. They loved being on base together as they were both menances to the defence. Agatha checked with Coach Grant who was standing in the third base box. He wasn’t indicating any signs. They were free to do as they pleased. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pretended to stretch both arms out to her sides - the sign to take a large lead off. Peggy nodded. If they both took large leads, Rio wouldn’t know where to throw it. She might make a wild throw and allow them to steal. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy took her lead, and Agatha took a few steps. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Careful, Angel.” Greta warned her. Unusual for the opposing team, but Greta and Agatha had a friendly relationship. They had played together for a year and became relatively close during that time, well closer than most teammates got to Agatha. She purposefully kept most players at arm's length, preferring to focus on the game. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha figured Greta was just trying to throw her off, make her doubt herself. She took another little jump. Rio’s back was towards her, and she knew her long wind-up would make it hard for her to turn and catch her. Rio glanced toward Peggy. She didn’t look towards Agatha, so she took another shuffle towards second. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The pitcher started to get ready and stood tall. Then, she spun and fired to the second baseman who moved her glove to Peggy, who slid head first back to the bag. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Safe!” the umpire called. That was close.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded to Peggy, but this time Peggy shook her head. She didn’t want to try that again. Agatha went anyway. She stepped off of first base and took two large steps. She had a wide stance like she was straddling a horse, ready to slide back if needed or take off if possible. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio threw a strike that Fern missed. She got ready for the next pitch, and Agatha took her lead off again. She saw Rio peek over her shoulder, but she made no indication of a turn. Agatha took another step. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio spun and threw to Greta who caught it at her chest. The first baseman moved her glove forward and tapped Agatha easily. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Out!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy watched in shock as Agatha had to make the walk of shame off the field. Rio twinkled her fingers at her and smiled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What was that?” Coach Grant turned and barked at her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wasn’t even the lead runner. She had no reason to throw it at me!” Agatha tried to defend her silly mistake. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah sure, but that pitcher obviously has it out for you. You should have known better. Why give her the opportunity?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry, Coach. I wanted to prevent a double play. I thought I could get back in time.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You were careless. That rookie is making you forget all the fundamentals. Another mistake like that, and I’m going to have to consider your place on this team.” Coach did not want to take it that far, but Agatha was distracted. Rivalries could be good, but he had also seen how they could take down both players if they let it get personal. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed. She was letting Rio get to her. She sat and watched the rest of the inning. Peggy made it home and scored for the Comets, which ended up being the game’s only run. They won again, and Agatha felt relief. She wouldn’t have to face Rio again for a while. She needed to reset and find her groove again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nice work, Peggy.” She clapped her friend on the back as they walked to the locker room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks. Can’t believe you let her pick you off at first!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t </span>
<em>
<span>let </span>
</em>
<span>her do anything.” Agatha fought back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy gave her a knowing look, “Sure, whatever you have to tell yourself, babe.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why would I do that? I didn’t think she was going to go for me!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn’t need to take such a huge lead. It’s not like you could steal second anyway. You were just trying to impress the girl.” Peggy had a teasing lilt to her tone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Impress her? Yeah, right.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah…right.” Peggy saw the way that Agatha had changed. They had been friends for over a decade, played on this team for five years, and Rio had unleashed something new. Something had changed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha brushed it off and joined the rest of the team in the locker room. They packed up and were back in the hotel within the hour. Peggy conked out almost immediately and was snoring as Agatha pulled out her journal. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She wrote down her stats for the game, and then her thoughts. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I don’t know what it is about Rio. I feel insane when I’m playing against her. It’s like she is reading my thoughts and knows my every pet peeve and how to exploit them. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I hate striking out. She strikes me out. I hate getting picked off. She picks me off at first. I wrote in that apology letter that she should just stick to the strike zone, so what does she do? Throws mostly balls and walks me. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>At the very least, I got a hit off her and threw her out trying to steal. The score is not even yet, but I have some points on the board. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She is like a headache. I can’t stop thinking about it no matter what else I do. Our team thoroughly crushed theirs though. She probably won’t play tomorrow, and we won’t face the Sallies again for a while. I can’t wait for the break. I need to stop thinking about this rookie. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha finished her notes and dug in her suitcase for the team calendar. They were headed back home next to face the Blue Sox. She flipped to August. </span>
<em>
<span>Drat</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They would go up against Rio’s team again at the start of next month. She circled the date with her pen. August 5th. A double header. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She had four weeks until she had to see Rio again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Four weeks to prepare. </span>

<blockquote>
<p>“You’ve got to remember that this was a time when it was not a popular idea for a woman to be playing baseball. We didn’t realize what pioneers we were, but we were really out there as forerunners, as far as women’s sports are concerned. We constantly bucked public opinion. You know, they looked at you kind of funny and thought maybe you should be in the kitchen, or you should be at home sewing curtains, but you certainly shouldn’t be out there running the bases.”</p>
<p>Lavonne “Pepper” Paire</p>
</blockquote><p>They easily won the next game, sweeping the series 4-0 against the Sallies. The four hour bus ride back the next morning was full of raucous singing and joyful noise as the Comets celebrated their big wins. The team was now tied for third in the league. There were still two and a half months to go before the playoffs, but this was their best start in history. </p><p>Last year, the team had sunk to the cellar and placed last. It was disappointing and incredibly embarrassing given the talented players they had. The Comets reached the championship in the inaugural season in 1943 but struggled to repeat their success. </p><p>Whether it was due to manager changes, injuries, trades, team cohesion, or better competition, who’s to say? Baseball was a fickle mistress. </p><p>The only thing Agatha knew was that she wanted to get back on top. She was desperate to win the league for the team and finally snatch victory from the Peaches or the Belles. This year could be it. They had the skill, they just needed to perform. </p><p>The bus arrived just after noon outside their home stadium and the girls said their goodbyes. Most lived within walking distance of the ballpark with local families, and the few others who lived farther out either drove or got picked up. They had three days off before their next game. </p><p>“See you two! What time is practice tomorrow?” Wanda threw her bag over her shoulder as she shuffled the twins towards the parking lot. </p><p>“3pm. See you then!” Peggy waved and grabbed her equipment. Agatha fell into lockstep with her as they walked the four blocks to 18th Avenue. </p><p>They shared a room at the home of Gertrude and Pearl, two old maids who owned a ranch-style house and offered to host two ballplayers. Agatha and Peggy had roomed here for two years, having previously stayed with Mr. and Mrs. Remulout, before those two decided to move to Minnesota. </p><p>Gertrude Davis and Pearl Thatcher were childhood friends, who were born and raised in Kenosha. They never married, despite multiple proposals, and seemed perfectly content to live together. After Pearl’s boyfriend died during the influenza pandemic in the 20’s, Gertrude decided to move into her house to cover the mortgage. Gertie, as she preferred to be called, worked at the local library, and Pearl was a secretary at a law firm. They were in their early 60’s but as active and as hilarious as ever. </p><p>They didn’t know the first thing about baseball, but they loved the community and were always keen to help out. When the league asked for volunteer hosts for the new club, they put their hands up and offered up their spare bedroom. </p><p>The house was kitschy, wood-panelled yet covered in seemingly endless framed pictures, and adorned with every kind of knick-knack. The two women each had their own bedroom, so Agatha and Peggy had to share the third bedroom, which was fine. It was a decent size and easily fit the two twin beds, plus there was a large closet and space for a tall dresser. There was a basement where they could store their baseball gear, and they even got their own bathroom, which was a real luxury. </p><p>Pearl was a true chef in the kitchen, and she generously cooked for the whole house. They often invited Wanda and the boys over for dinner on off-nights, and other gals on the team would often beg for a dinner invite. </p><p>The pair rarely came to any of the Comets games, but they always listened to the broadcast on the radio. If they ever heard anything about an injury to Agatha or Peggy, there would be bandages or antiseptic on the table when they came home. Or just because, they would walk in to milk and cookies waiting for them.</p><p>Agatha never had a doting or loving mother before and living here seemed to heal a small part of her soul. </p><p>“We’re back!” She unlocked the door and burst through into the living room. </p><p>“Pearl, wake up. The girls are here.” Gertie gently jostled her napping friend on the couch beside her. </p><p>“Did you miss us?” Peggy asked playfully. </p><p>“Missed the quiet maybe!” Pearl grumbled with her eyes still closed. </p><p>“Congratulations on the wins. We listened to it all. How about that new pitcher? What was her name - Rhea? It was hard to hear the announcer properly.” Gertie sat up and put the newspaper on the coffee table. </p><p>“Rio…” Agatha tried to disguise her disdain. </p><p>“Right, Rio! She sounds like a real pain in the neck for you, Agatha. I thought Pearl was going to spill her hot chocolate when they said you had rushed over and pushed her down. What came over you, dear?”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip, the anger radiating off her in waves, and Peggy jumped in, “She had it coming. Throwing a ball at a batter’s head is way out of line. You could kill someone like that.”</p><p>“If you say so, but remember to be ladies out there. You shouldn’t be stirring up any trouble.” Gertie admonished them but then gestured to the kitchen. “There are some cheese sandwiches and fruit on the counter if you’re hungry.”</p><p>“Thanks! We’re starving.” They went to drop their bags in their room then devoured the leftover lunch. It was as delicious as always. Pearl could transform even the most simple meals into delectable treats. There was just something about a sandwich made by someone else that made it taste that much better. </p><p>Agatha decided to have a catnap after eating. She had a hard time sleeping on the bus rides, between the constant noise and having to sit upright. She preferred to read, play cards, or study up on her notes for the next game. When she woke up, the sun was starting to set. </p><p>“Hey, want to go catch a film? I saw Dottie and Lupe at the park, and they invited us.” Peggy was lounging on her bed. </p><p>“Yeah, I could use the distraction.”</p><p>“We’re leaving in 10. Dottie said she’d pick us up.”</p><p>Agatha threw on her favorite lavender shirtwaist dress with small white polka dots and donned a pair of modest pumps. She wrangled her hair into presentable waves and grabbed her purse. </p><p>The old Studebaker pulled up in front of their house, and they piled in and rode downtown to the old picture house. </p><p>“What’s showing? It’s been a while since I’ve seen anything.” Agatha asked. </p><p>They studied the posters outside the box office. </p><p>“Looks like we can see <em> Easter Parade </em> with Fred Astaire and Judy Garland, or <em> The Emperor Waltz </em>with Bing Crosby and Joan Fontaine.” Lupe explained. </p><p>“Oooh, I prefer Ms Judy if nobody objects.” Peggy threw out her opinion and the group agreed. </p><p>“I’ll get the popcorn and drinks.” Agatha took off to the concession stand with Peggy. </p><p>“Are you good?” Peggy asked as they waited in the long line. </p><p>“Copacetic. Why? Do I look like I’m not good?” </p><p>“I know you, Agatha. You look like you’re a thousand miles away.”</p><p>“Well, hopefully Fred and Judy can snap me out of it.” She joked. Truthfully, she was stuck on a rollercoaster named Rio that seemed to be running wild in her mind. Every choice she had made, every moment leading up to every moment they faced each other. What she could have done differently, what she wished she could have done. </p><p>It was constant, but if she really dug deep…she didn’t hate it. No other player had ever challenged her to this level. Five years of playing and she had gotten complacent. Rio was like grabbing an electric fence - a shock to the system. </p><p>“Agatha, you’re up.” </p><p>She was pulled from the confines of her brain. “Huh? Oh, sorry. Two popcorns and four Cokes.” </p><p>It was nice to sit in the dark and escape to a different world for a while. </p><p>When the movie finished, they walked slowly to the car and decided to cruise around the neighborhood. </p><p>“I can’t believe that people can really dance like that! Ann Miller really swept the floor; I wish she could teach me a thing or two.” Peggy was gushing over the musical numbers. </p><p>“How about Fred! He’s still got it.” Dottie swooned. </p><p>“Sure, but Judy and Ann do everything he does except backwards and in heels! There’s no comparison really.” Agatha pointed out and everyone laughed. </p><p>“Can you imagine if Judy’s character played ball? That would be a gas!” Lupe added. </p><p>“I don’t think she would even make it past try-outs. If the coach said go to left field, she could be running around searching for hours.” Peggy joked, as the character in the movie suffered from severe left-right confusion. </p><p>The group shared other funny scenarios where this confusion could result in hilarious results, and before they knew it, they were back out the front of Peggy and Agatha’s house. </p><p>“See you at practice tomorrow. Thanks for the ride!” Agatha called out as they walked up the pathway to the front door. </p><p>The next day they arrived at their home park, Simmons Field at 2:30pm. They had moved into this new field this year, having played the previous years as Lakefront Stadium. Agatha would miss the stunning waterfront views but wouldn’t miss the fog and chilling lake breeze that seemed to hit every night, even in summer. </p><p>“You good, Angel?” Wanda looked up as Agatha and Peggy walked into the dressing room. </p><p>Agatha threw her mitt down, “What’s going on? Is everyone talking about me behind my back or something?” </p><p>Wanda looked to Peggy for back-up and put her hands up, “Whoa whoa, nobody’s saying anything. I’m just checking that your head’s in the game. The Blue Sox have been on a winning streak too, so we need to be prepared.”</p><p>“Don’t get your knickers in a twist, doll.” Peggy reached out and placed a hand on Agatha’s shoulder. “Sometimes friends care about their friends, remember?”</p><p>Agatha resisted the urge to run and started putting her cleats on, “Sorry, Little Red. I’m fine. I think a nice hard practice will shake me from this funk.” </p><p>“Don’t let Coach over hear that. He’ll have us running the bases all night.” Wanda said. </p><p>They changed and walked out to the field with their mitts. The twins were carrying the bats and a bucket of balls each. They loved coming to every practice and every game. </p><p>Tommy already talked about his dream to become a pitcher in the major league one day. Billy was less interested in the baseball of it all, but he loved helping the team and talking with the gals. He had a special connection with Agatha, despite her many efforts to steer clear of the boys. </p><p>“Agatha! Do ya think you’ll hit a homer today?” He looked up at her and almost dropped the bucket he was carrying. </p><p>She ruffled his curly hair, “I sure hope so, kiddo. Will you fetch it if I do?”</p><p>“Yes, definitely! Tommy and I are going to be picking up all the balls during batting practice.”</p><p>“That’s super helpful. Are you going to catch any?”</p><p>“Oh no! I don’t want to get hit in the head! Tommy’s been practicing, maybe he’ll catch some.”</p><p>Agatha laughed. He was a precious kid, and she couldn’t help caring for him. “If your mom buys you a mitt, you won’t get hit in the noggin. The mitt will protect you.”</p><p>“I don’t know…I’d rather just sit in the dugout. I just got the new Donald Duck comic! I love Huey, Dewey, and Louie. The pictures are so funny.” Billy always had his head in a comic book. </p><p>At the mention of the characters, Agatha suddenly flashed back in time. </p><p>
<em> “Mama, can I have a Mickey Mouse doll for Christmas?” Nicky asked her one day as they walked home from the corner store.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “Is he your favorite character? I thought you liked Donald more?”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> Nicky didn’t respond right away. Agatha could almost see his brain working. He had the most adorable concentration face. “But Mickey has Pluto! I want to get a dog one day too.”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “A dog! That’s a big responsibility. Dogs need lots of attention, care, and love. Not all dogs are as well-behaved as Pluto.”  </em>
</p><p>
<em> “I will walk it and feed it. I promise! Can I get a dog when I turn six?”  </em>
</p><p>Agatha had to close her eyes to try to stifle the tears. </p><p>They would never get a dog. </p><p>He would never turn six. </p><p>She tried to focus on the actual little boy still waiting for a response, ‘You’ll have to show me later, okay?”</p><p>“Okay! I will!” He was nearly jumping with excitement and one of the bats fell from his hands and rolled away. </p><p>Coach Grant was already on the field stretching his arm. </p><p>“Bring it in, girls! We’ve got our first game against the Blue Sox on Saturday, and they are currently on a roll. They’ve been averaging at least three runs each game, as they have a strong line-up of batters. Our defence is going to need to be solid to hold them. Today we’re going to work on grounders and covering the outfield. Let’s get started with a warm up run, then grab your mitts.”</p><p>The first hour was spent on conditioning and fielding drills. Although Agatha almost exclusively played catcher, she liked to keep her glove and arm in shape, so she practiced with the outfielders as well. It was a warm afternoon, and she was already sweating. </p><p>When her muscles were aching and her lungs were working hard, she didn’t have time to worry about a certain pitcher or think about any past mistakes or haunting memories. It was the perfect distraction. They took a short break before jumping into batting practice. </p><p>Coach took the mound, “Their pitchers aren’t anything special. I expect that we’ll have a strong showing against them. Mary is their starter and has a decent curveball. I’ll throw you a mix of pitches. Don’t hold back.”</p><p>One by one they took their turn at the plate. Wanda slammed one to the outfield, and Tommy tried his best to catch it but underestimated the distance and it flew over his head. </p><p>Agatha was up and let two go by before she saw the pitch she wanted. A low fast ball, her bread and butter. She hit it straight out over Coach, and it soared over the fence. Home run. </p><p>She could hear Billy’s little claps as she walked back to the line and tipped her cap at him. Agatha had the current home run record this season. Jo Deluca of the Peaches set the league record in a single season at 28 in 1944. Agatha was already at 10 and hoping to challenge for the record. It helped that the ball was getting smaller every year and easier to hit, but that was neither here nor there. </p><p>“Great work today. Take tomorrow off, and I’ll see you here late Saturday afternoon for a quick practice before the game at 6pm.” Coach released them for the night. </p><p>Friday was spent in a blur of chores and errands. Agatha usually helped Pearl with the grocery shopping, and Peggy helped with the cleaning and laundry. They also usually used their free time to go to the bank and deposit their cheques.</p><p>As veteran players they were both earning $110 a week, which was the most money either had ever seen. Agatha only made $30 a week at her factory gig, so this was a massive windfall. The league also covered their meals on the road, and their rent was comically low. She was able to put away a majority of her earnings into her savings account. </p><p>At this point, she wasn’t sure what she was saving for. Her house back in Salem was paid off thanks in part to Ralph, who had sent his military wages home during the war and from her regular job during the off-season. She had a car back home. She didn’t want for anything…well nothing that money could buy anyway. </p><p>Saturday rolled around. Another day, another game. </p><p>“Good luck, girls! Win another for us.” Gertie said from the couch as Agatha and Peggy headed off to the ballpark. </p><p>“We believe in you…or whatever makes you feel good.” Peggy grumbled without looking up from her novel. </p><p>They walked along the sidewalk and neighbors greeted them and wished them luck all the way there. The town was incredibly proud of its ballplayers, and the fans were very passionate and kind. The stands were almost always full to capacity at home games. </p><p>“Do you think you’ll win today, Angel?” A young girl asked as she followed along behind them. </p><p>“What do you think, Jackie?” Agatha turned and smiled at the pre-teen. </p><p>“I think you will! I bet my brother a packet of M&amp;M’s that you’d win tonight.” </p><p>“Well get ready to enjoy some chocolate.” Peggy reassured the young fan, who squealed and ran ahead of them to the field. </p><p>“Are you that confident?” Agatha looked at Peggy slyly. </p><p>“Why not? I’m not about to crush that kid’s hopes, and we’ve been playing great. I think we could beat any team in this league right now.”</p><p>“I wish I could bottle your confidence.” Agatha said. It’s not that she didn’t believe in the team. She just knew how things could turn on a dime. High expectations often led to a long fall to reality. </p><p>She could write a book about the danger of hope. </p><p>In this case, her worries were unfounded. The Comets eked out a win 1-0 against the Blue Sox. Shirley had batted in Wanda from third base for a run, and they were now on a seven game winning streak. Agatha had also netted two more hits for her record and had thrown out a runner trying to steal second. It was a good game all around. </p><p>To top it off, when the game ended, she had heard her name being shouted from the stands. This wasn’t unusual but this particular voice sounded very persistent. Agatha turned to look and saw Jackie waving a distinct pack of candy in the air with a huge toothy grin on her face. Agatha nudged Peggy, and they both burst out laughing.</p><p>Sometimes the joy of the game came from a well-deserved win, and sometimes it came from something as small and insignificant as a successful wager over some chocolate.</p>

<p>“At first we took a lot of ribbing, ‘Go home where you belong!’ ‘Go take care of your kids!’ but eventually we won them over.”</p>
<p>Vivian Kellogg</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>“Agatha, do you want to come with us tomorrow?”</p><p>She looked over at Lupe, “Where are you going?” They had just finished up their second game against the Blue Sox. Another win in the bank. </p><p>“Horsey and Shirley wanted to go watch the Racine game at 11.” The team often went to watch the Belles play since Racine and Kenosha were only 20 minutes apart from each other. It was a great way to scope out the other teams and pass the time. </p><p>“Who are they playing?”</p><p>“The Sallies.” Lupe replied, and of course, Agatha was in. She didn’t know if Rio would be pitching, but she couldn’t pass up the opportunity. She roped in Peggy as well, and a few other gals jumped in to join. </p><p>The next day they split up into two cars and motored up to Racine to catch the game. The Belles were not at their best this year. They had won the trophy in 1946, but they lost their entire pitching roster this year when the league went overhand. Two of their infielders left after getting married, and the new additions weren’t gelling with the rest of the team. </p><p>They grabbed seats in the stands behind home plate where they could get a good view of the game. Agatha looked to the bullpen. She saw her immediately. Rio was warming up with Shaw. </p><p>“Your arch nemesis is pitching.” Peggy pointed across the field and Agatha hastily tried to grab her hand, not wanting to draw attention to themselves. </p><p>“She’s not my nemesis.” Agatha mumbled under her breath. </p><p>The Sallies were in the field first, and it looked like Rio was actually starting the game. <em> Interesting </em>. Agatha wondered what had changed. Maybe the coach was just trying something new. </p><p>“First up to bat is the center fielder, Virginia Booker!” The announcer’s voice rang from the speakers around the stands. </p><p>Agatha watched Rio take a deep breath. She wondered if this was her first start, if she was nervous, if she got scared. </p><p>She settled both hands in her glove, brought them both over her head, and kicked out her leg. Agatha watched the ball zip into the catcher’s glove. </p><p>“Strike.” They could hear the ump’s call clearly. </p><p>“That looked like a change-up.” Peggy said. </p><p>“How could you tell from here?” Shirley was sitting behind them and leaned forward to ask. </p><p>“It was much slower than her normal fastball. Booker swung way too early, so it must have looked like it was coming in hot. Either that or she’s just a poor hitter.” She laughed. </p><p>Rio’s next pitch just missed the strike zone and was called a ball. She then fired one right down the middle. Agatha could hear the connection when the ball hit the catcher’s mitt. </p><p>“Okay, yeah that first one definitely wasn’t that fast.” She added. Other pitchers were fast, but Rio seemed to turn the dial up. She also seemed to have more control compared to the others. </p><p>With every batter that came up, Agatha tried to imagine herself in their place. She would watch the pitches go by and try to time up exactly when she would swing. By the fourth inning, she felt like she might have a chance, but Rio didn’t seem to have the normal weaknesses of most pitchers. She didn’t favor any of her pitches, and she didn’t have any noticeable pattern. She would sometimes throw three fastballs in a row for one batter, then strike another out with just off-speed pitches. </p><p>She was surprisingly adaptable, but everyone has their faults. Whenever a batter managed to get a hit off her, Rio couldn’t hide her upset and didn’t immediately react to the hit. Agatha studied her like a scientist studying an animal in a cage. She was keen to learn everything there was to know about this rookie. </p><p>“Remember to blink, babe.” Peggy whispered out of the corner of her mouth. </p><p>Agatha hadn’t realized she was staring so hard. She shoved her friend and redirected her gaze to the field. Rio pitched for seven innings before being relieved. She only allowed four hits and no runs. A very impressive start. The Sallies were actually leading with one run. If they could just hold the Belles, they would earn a much-needed win. </p><p>By some miracle, they were able to pull it off and win 1-0. Agatha watched the Sallies celebrate and even Rio cracked a smile, despite her usual stoic expression. </p><p>Shirley checked her watch, “We should probably leave in a jiffy to make it back home for our own game.” </p><p>“Good call, ready everyone?” Peggy stood up, and they made their way to the exits. Their game started in two hours, but everyone needed to get home, grab their equipment, and get to the ballpark. </p><p>“Thanks for inviting us Lupe, that was good recon.” Agatha said. </p><p>“No problem. If we want to win the title this year, we need to know our competition inside and out.” Lupe explained as they got into the car. </p><p>“Amen.” Agatha agreed. She didn’t want her baseball career to end without lifting the trophy at least once. </p><hr/><p>They won game three against South Bend and were warming up for their final game against their opponents. This was the longest winning streak the Comets had ever been on. If they won tonight, it would tie for the longest streak in league history. No pressure.</p><p>“Team, regardless of tonight’s outcome, I am so proud of everyone. You have all played your hearts out, and I couldn’t ask for much more. Now let’s give these folks a show, and prove why we deserve to win it all this year!” Coach Grant riled them up before they took to the field. </p><p>“Let’s do this!” Wanda shouted to a harmony of cheers and whoops. </p><p>For some reason, everything had just been clicking with the team lately. Everybody was having success at bat, they had no errors in the field, and the pitching had propelled them to many victories. In all of Agatha’s years with the team, this was the most confident she had ever felt. </p><p>She walked out onto the field for the national anthem and stood along the third base line with her teammates as a local singer attempted to belt out the challenging tune. She often used this time to scan the crowd and see who was in attendance. </p><p>Sometimes she would see the mayor, a huge baseball fan, or the town’s chief of police. The jeweller once gave her a pearl necklace for hitting a home run during the playoffs. They were incredibly lucky to have a dedicated fan base of locals and those from nearby towns. She saw many familiar faces tonight, and then her eyes stopped. </p><p>Second row, behind the backstop, with Greta Gill and Carson Shaw. <em> Why can’t she leave me alone? </em> Rio was standing with her hand on her heart, reciting the anthem. She wasn’t looking at the flag. She was looking at one thing only, one person. </p><p>Agatha looked away. It was too intense and strangely intimate, despite the thousands of other onlookers. Rio’s gaze was carnivorous, like she was ripping the skin off Agatha and feasting on her. </p><p>“A couple of spies at 2 o’clock.” She whispered to Peggy beside her and nodded in the direction of the Sallies players in the stands. </p><p>“It’s not a crime to watch a ballgame, Agatha.” She whispered back. </p><p>
<em> She’s right. We just did the same thing. It’s not against the rules.  </em>
</p><p>The song finished, “Play ball!” </p><p>“We’re batting first. Dottie’s leading off. Stick to the plan, and go for the base hits. No need for any long-balls, we don’t want to give away any easy fly outs.” Coach advised them before taking his place next to third base. </p><p>Dottie and Horsey got on base, and Peggy hit into an unfortunate double-play. Shirley hit a slow grounder straight to first and was out. Agatha would be up first next inning. </p><p>She rushed to get her catcher’s gear on and trotted out to the plate. Babe Nichol was starting today. She was another old-timer who had been on the team since the start. Agatha and her had developed an easy chemistry over the years. </p><p>Babe was recently engaged and contemplating leaving the league. She wanted the typical suburban dream, white picket fence and all. Agatha would be sorry to see her go. She had a nasty sidearm and a knack for reading batters. </p><p>“Nice gams, Angel!” </p><p>She turned toward the catcall and saw Greta waving at her. She hated when men shouted out at her, but Greta was an old friend. They had first met at tryouts and maintained a friendly sort-of friendship throughout the years playing against each other. Agatha liked Greta’s unabashed confidence, and Greta respected Agatha’s wit and skill at the game. </p><p>“Take a picture, it’ll last longer.” She shouted back to the enjoyment of the other fans. Even Rio laughed at the old joke. </p><p>As she squatted down behind the plate, she gave the signal to the pitcher and waited. A hush generally fell over the crowd while the batter was up to bat. But, Agatha could just hear the distinct voices of Greta and Carson. </p><p>“....used to be married, I think. I’m not sure.”</p><p>“Yeah, I heard she’s divorced…”</p><p>She caught the ball that was aimed at her glove. <em> Are they talking to Rio about…me? </em> She felt self-conscious suddenly. <em> Maybe I misheard. </em> </p><p>“...from New York like you Greta…”</p><p>
<em> Okay, definitely not about me.  </em>
</p><p>“No way, she’s from outside Boston…”</p><p>
<em> Nevermind. </em>
</p><p>The next pitch was a ball. She was losing track of the count as all her energy was going towards her listening skills. It was so hard to focus on a singular conversation among the noise and pay attention to the game. </p><p>She called for a fastball. Babe shook her off. She called for it again. Another shake of the head. </p><p>“Time.” She called for a break from the umpire and stood to go see what the problem was. </p><p>“Why are you asking for a fastball? You know this hitter eats those for breakfast.” Babe held her mitt up to shield their conversation from the batter and opposing team. </p><p>“Huh? Oh…sorry. I was…distracted.” Agatha looked back at the batter and kicked herself for her slip up. </p><p>“Get your head in the game. I need you, okay?” </p><p>“I’ve got you, Babe” Agatha jogged back and re-focussed. She tuned out any back chatter and called the right pitch. </p><p>The batter popped it straight up in the air. Agatha ripped off her mask and looked skyward, tracking the ball as it fell back to Earth. </p><p>“I’ve got it!” She yelled. She opened her glove and caught it easily. </p><p>“What a catch, folks! Another brilliant play by the catcher.” The announcer said. </p><p>She waved her glove in the air to applause and saw the Sallies players standing and clapping. Rio gave her a subtle nod of the head in acknowledgement and lifted her applauding hands. <em> I’ll take that.  </em></p><p>The next inning, Agatha was the first batter. She made the journey from the dugout to the box. </p><p>“Don’t choke, Harkness!” Greta’s taunts were clear, but after so many years in this game, Agatha was a pro at filtering out teasing from the crowd. Those first few seasons were brutal with abuse from small-minded men who couldn’t comprehend the concept of women playing ball. </p><p>Agatha gave a stately wave to Greta, who wiggled her fingers back in jest. Rio seemed to be enjoying herself next to her. She was smiling widely. </p><p><em> She’s got a pretty smile. </em> The wandering sentence floated through Agatha’s mind to her shock and surprise. She looked away before another unwelcome thought came knocking. </p><p>Agatha felt the back of her neck warm. <em> Must be the heat. </em> She justified to herself and set her feet in the box. Her stomach felt as light as air. Her hands were damp as her palms felt sweaty. She readjusted her grip on the bat. <em> It must be hotter than I thought.  </em></p><p>The first pitch was a meatball, big and juicy, right down the middle. <em> Perfect. </em>Agatha leaned back and poured her power into her swing. She waited to feel the vibration of connection, the pop when the ball hit the wood, but instead she felt nothing. </p><p>She watched in horror as her bat slipped from her wet hands and flew through the air like a swinging trapeze artist. </p><p>“Look out!” Someone shouted as the flying projectile went right for Fossey in the on deck circle. She ducked just in time to the relief of the gasping fans. The bat ricocheted off the fence and luckily didn’t make it into the stands. </p><p>Agatha dropped her head and cringed. She had never flung a bat in her entire life. It happened to the best of them but not to her. She wished she could disappear. </p><p>Billy ran over and collected the stray bat. He moved his little feet as fast as he could and gave it back to Agatha. “Here you go.” He said cheerfully, which helped lessen the pain. </p><p>“Nice one, Butterfingers!” Greta’s jibe brought out a wave of laughter from everyone within earshot. Agatha’s anger rose. </p><p>She focussed all her frustration into her body. It was one of the skills that made her so good. She was able to take all her negative emotions and transform them into explosions of power. Where some people’s grief and despair crippled them, Agatha’s made her harder and stronger. </p><p>The next pitch wasn’t as sweet as the first, but it would have to do. She imagined the ball as all the painful jeers and taunts that people hurled at her, and she crushed it with her bat. </p><p>“Look at that ball go! Big dog’s gotta eat! That’s another home run for Agatha Harkness!” The announcer’s excited yell boomed throughout the ballpark. </p><p>She watched the ball hang in the air like it was fighting gravity and turned to see the three Sallies players staring at its trajectory. She saluted Greta as she jogged around the bases in a celebratory galavant. When she made it back around to home, Billy was there grabbing her bat and jumping up and down. She sprinted the last few yards and picked him up, swinging him around in a circle before carrying him under her arm back to the dugout. </p><p>“That was a heck of a dinger!” Coach tipped his cap to her as she went to sit amongst a thrall of pats on the back and congrats. No matter how many homers she hit, it was always just as exciting. </p><p>“You crushed that ball!” Tommy looked up at her in awe. </p><p>“Yeah, crushed it!” Billy echoed his twin, and they sat down on either side of her on the bench. </p><p>“Nice save from that <em> appalling </em>slip of the bat.” Peggy stood in front of her and joked. </p><p>“Don’t remind me.” Agatha leaned her head back and pulled her hat down to cover her eyes. </p><p>“I’ve never seen you make that mistake. Anything to do with those ‘spies’ in the crowd?”</p><p>Agatha lifted her cap a miniscule amount to look at Peggy, “My hands were sweaty.”</p><p>“Whatever you say.”</p><p>The Comets were able to win 2-0 and tie the record at nine wins in a row. Just one more win and they would set a new record for the league. </p><p>“Impressive work out there. Let’s keep it up! We only have one day off before our next run of games against the Redwings. We’re staying in town, so I’ll see you on Thursday before the game.” Coach released them and the team got changed.</p><p>Agatha and Peggy were the last out of the locker room. They had been chatting while Agatha wrote in her journal. Shirley and Dottie had also hung around and left with the two friends. </p><p>“Hey Butterfingers! Nice hitting tonight.” They turned and saw Greta, Carson, and Rio approaching them from the parking lot, each holding a beer bottle in their hands. </p><p>“Thanks, doll. Taking notes?” Agatha asked. </p><p>“I’d rather not endanger my fans.” Greta responded. </p><p>“You sharing those around?” Peggy pointed to the unopened case that Carson was carrying. Shaw looked at Greta who nodded. They passed around the bottles. Everyone took one but Shirley. </p><p>“What do you all want anyway?” Agatha eyed them curiously. They all knew the rule about spending time with their competitors.</p><p>“It’s not everyday we get the chance to be in the presence of greatness.” Greta started to bow to Agatha, who scoffed and took a hearty swig of her drink. </p><p>“We just had a friendly wager we wanted to propose.” Shaw spoke. </p><p>“Gambling is illegal, which I’m sure you are all aware of. I don’t think the league would approve of this.” Shirley, ever the rule follower, added her two cents. </p><p>“Shush, Shirley. Let’s hear them out at least.” Agatha was interested in what they could possibly have to say. Rio was standing beside Greta, drinking in silence. </p><p>“Ten pitches. If you can hit a homer, we’ll give you $100.” Greta laid out the terms. “Offer goes for any of you brave enough to face this rookie.” She patted Rio on the head. </p><p>Agatha was itching to face Rio again but thought it sounded too good to be true, “And if none of us homers?” </p><p>“You pay us the hundred.” Greta said. </p><p>“I don’t think this is a good idea…” Shirley was debating whether to run or to watch. </p><p>Agatha didn’t have to think about it, “I’m in. Let’s finish these drinks and wait for the ballpark to clear out, then it’ll be empty and available.”</p><p>“We’re not meant to play on the field outside of practice and games!” Shirley looked at them all incredulously. </p><p>“You can go back home, darling. No one is forcing you to be here.” Greta said with a tone. </p><p>Shirley looked at Agatha and Peggy, who clearly had no intention of leaving. Dottie shrugged and took another swig of beer, “I want to see how this plays out.”</p><p>They all walked around the park and sat in the field just beyond the outfield fence. Shirey was begrudgingly still trailing along. </p><p>“Are you short on lettuce or something? Did you blow all your cash on fancy purses and dresses?” Agatha asked, still confused on why they were making this bet now. </p><p>Greta laid down in the grass and looked up at the stars as she spoke, “I didn’t realize the Comets were the fun police. Thought you gals wouldn’t mind some friendly competition.” </p><p>“Not all of us are so lucky to be on a record-setting winning streak, Angel. We have to find our enjoyment with this game elsewhere.” Shaw had her head resting on Greta’s belly. Agatha watched Greta playing with Carson’s hair aimlessly. There was something oddly tender about the interaction. She wanted to ask about it but felt it was improper to pry. </p><p>“What about you? How did they rope you into this?” Peggy pointed to Rio, who had yet to speak. </p><p>“The only way to get better is to play against the best.” She said without elaboration. </p><p>Agatha chugged the rest of her can and felt the heady buzz from the alcohol. The last lights were turned off. They were alone in the dark, lit only by the summer moon. “Looks like everyone’s gone. Ready when you are.” She stood up and dusted off her dress. </p><p>The rest of the gang stood, and they hopped the short chain link fence to get onto the field. </p><p>The Comets players put their bags down along the first base line. Peggy lent her glove to Rio, and Agatha gave hers to Carson then grabbed her bat. Dottie grabbed a few spare baseballs from a bucket in the dugout. </p><p>“Rules are…there are no rules!” Greta stood on the pitcher’s mound and spun in a circle, stumbling slightly as she lost her footing. “Just kidding. Some rules - Rio will throw out ten pitches per batter, no purposeful balls, and whoever can hit a homer gets the cash.”</p><p>“What if more than one of us hits it outta here?” Peggy asked and Rio almost keeled over in laughter. She steadied herself on a similarly cackling Greta. </p><p>“Yeah sure. Good luck.” Greta conceded. </p><p>Peggy, Agatha, and Dottie huddled in a circle near home plate. Shirley was sitting on the visitor’s bench, a silent observer. </p><p>“Who wants to go first?” Peggy asked. “They look pretty corked. I don’t know how many drinks they’ve had, but I don’t think Rio’s at the top of her game. We might have a shot.”</p><p>“I’ll go last. I want her a little worn out” Agatha said. </p><p>“I reckon I can take her.” Dottie decided to take the first crack. She wasn’t even sure how she ended up here, but the first baseman wasn’t one to turn down the prospect of fifty bucks. </p><p>Rio was dressed in a plain red a-line skirt and white collarless pintuck blouse. She was buzzed, using a borrowed glove, and wearing Mary Janes. If ever there was time, when they could get a hit off her, this was it. </p><p>The first pitch was a high heater. Swing and a miss. She smiled in satisfaction. </p><p>“Come on Dottie, you got this!” Agatha cheered on her teammate. </p><p>“I can barely see the ball!” Dottie called back over her shoulder. The moonlight was surprisingly bright and it was a clear night sky, but it was a sad substitute for the bright stadium lights. </p><p>The next three pitches soared past her. On the fifth, she connected and popped one up into left field. Greta ran to fetch it. She missed the next two, and grounded the final three. No dice. </p><p>“Nice try!” Peggy tried to console her and took the bat for her turn. Rio seemed to be glowing with pride. Agatha couldn’t wait for her turn. </p><p>“I’m getting bored out here!” Greta yelled from the outfield. </p><p>“Show them what you got, Peg.” Agatha tried to give her some pep. </p><p>The first two pitches were okay but on the very low edge of the strike zone. Peggy let them go by. The third pitch was well-placed and Peggy swung hard. The bat connected and Greta ran back, back, and caught it in deep center field. Close but no cigar. </p><p>Peggy kicked the dirt in frustration as Rio appeared to let out a sigh of relief. </p><p>“You almost had her. Just a touch more power and you’ve got it.” Agatha said. </p><p>She fouled off the next pitch, popped out the fifth and sixth. The seventh ball went soaring to left but hooked foul at the last moment despite Peggy trying to will it fair. The next two were misses, and on the final pitch, Peggy swung for the fences and struck out. </p><p>“Blast! How does she do it?” She grunted in anger as she turned to hand off the bat to Agatha. </p><p>“Give up yet?” Rio taunted from the mound. Agatha chewed her lip and let the annoyance fuel her. </p><p>“Shut up and pitch, Vidal!” Agatha sniped as she took her stance. </p><p>“Yes, ma’am.” </p><p>She let one go by. The second went foul, and the third was too far outside. She watched the fourth pitch leave Rio’s hand and could tell where it was going immediately. She took in a deep breath, rotated her body and released on the ball all her seething rage at this rookie pitcher. </p><p>
<em> Crack </em>
</p><p>They call it the most satisfying sound in sports. </p><p>And for good reason. The sound of a ball perfectly colliding with a wooden bat is like no other noise in the world. It resonates throughout the space and can give goosebumps to anyone lucky enough to hear it. It’s often easy to tell if a ball is destined to be a homer from the sound alone. </p><p>A sound like the one Agatha just unleashed to Rio’s horror. </p><p>They all watched as the tiny white speck disappeared into the deep black sky and soared over the fence. Gone. </p><p>Peggy whooped and screamed in delight. Even Shirley was on her feet clapping and cheering. Agatha made a show of rounding the bases, lifting her arms in the air in celebration. </p><p>When she made it back to home, Peggy and Dottie lifted her up in the air like she was queen of the universe. </p><p>“Double or nothing.” Rio called out from her position. </p><p>They set Agatha down, and she looked at the pitcher. “Sorry? Didn’t lose enough money tonight?”</p><p>“You heard me.”</p><p>“Yeah, and I’m tired. I want to get home. I won your bet, now pay up.” </p><p>Greta ran in from the outfield with the spare balls. “That was crazy, Angel. Sorry for doubting you.”</p><p>“Thanks, now tell this rookie to quit while she still can. We need to get home.” Agatha said. </p><p>“Come on, double or nothing. Don’t tell me you’re chicken?” Rio looked desperate. She clearly was not used to losing. </p><p>“Woah there, hon. Watch yourself.” Peggy added. </p><p>“I’m packing up now. I suggest you do the same.” Agatha was happy with her win. She didn’t want to push it further. She turned to put her bat away. </p><p>“I guess what they’re saying is true. You really are just a has-been.” Rio spat out and everyone’s eyes bulged. Peggy’s jaw dropped. </p><p>Agatha froze and turned slowly. Her hands gripped the bat with extra pressure. “Excuse me?”</p><p>“Five years in the league. Your days are numbered.” </p><p>“Rio, shut up!” Carson looked at her with panic.</p><p>Agatha took deliberate steps to the mound where the three opponents stood. </p><p>“Gonna push me again? Is that the best you can do?” Rio’s eyes were unfocussed. She was slurring her words slightly. The alcohol must be catching up to her, even though it didn’t seem to alter her pitching performance. </p><p>“Rio-” Greta put a hand on her shoulder to keep her steady. </p><p>“I suggest you stop talking and go home, babe. That mouth is going to get you in trouble.” Agatha was an arms length away. She feared what might happen if she got closer. Rio looked wild. </p><p>Carson spoke up first, “We’re going. We’ll get your cash tomorrow before we leave for the next town.” She handed Agatha’s catcher glove over. </p><p>“No wonder her husband left her. She’s such a-” Rio’s voice was cut off by a harsh, unexpected slap. Like the crack of the bat, this noise silenced the space.  </p><p>Peggy pointed her now extended hand out, “Don’t even think of finishing that horrible sentence.” </p><p>Rio held her cheek like it was precious. A beat passed as everyone stared at each other, unsure what to do. Then, like a rabid animal, Rio pounced and tackled Peggy to the dirt. </p><p>“Hey! Hey! What the…Get off of her!” Agatha dropped the bat and tried to grab the pitcher. Greta also tried to break it up, but Rio was hard to get a handle on. She had the swiftness of a fox and was spitting mad. She was swiping at Peggy’s face in retaliation. It was a cacophony of limbs. </p><p>Peggy was doing her best to roll out of it, but Rio was on top of her and pinning her down. Dottie sprinted over to try to help. </p><p>Greta finally got a hold of Rio’s shoulders and pulled her up just as she was winding up her right fist. Agatha was leaning down to pick up Peggy, and Rio’s fist collided with her face.</p><p>“OWWW, what the fuck?!?” </p><p>Agatha stumbled backwards, grasping her nose, which was now spouting blood. </p><p>Shirley ran over to witness the chaos and almost fainted at the sound of the curse word. Peggy had a few scratches on her cheek from Rio’s nails, but she wordlessly whipped off her cardigan and handed it to Agatha to staunch the bleeding. </p><p>“Rio, what have you done?” Carson was frozen like a statue, observing the chaos. </p><p>“I’m…I’m so sorry. I didn’t…I wasn’t trying to…” Rio was holding her hand tenderly. Her knuckles were bright red and whispering small drops of blood. She reached for the seated catcher who was still holding a sweater to her nose. </p><p>“Don’t touch me!” Agatha blurted out. She had taken her fair share of hits over the years. She had been knocked by stray throws, collisions at the plate, rough slides. But this was another level of pain. Every breath was painful, her entire face felt like it was throbbing. </p><p>“We should get outta here.” Greta pulled Rio and motioned to Carson. “Meet me here tomorrow at noon, and I’ll give you your winnings. Come on girls.” </p><p>Dottie took the gloves and balls from the Sallies players, and they watched them scurry away. Rio looked back at Agatha with a harsh sadness in her big eyes. Agatha scowled back in anger. </p><p>“Can you walk?” Peggy held a hand down to Agatha who nodded up at her. “Nobody say nothing, ya hear?” She looked pointedly at Shirley, who pretended to zipper her mouth shut. </p><p>The four women swore each other to secrecy. If the coaches or chaperones got wind of what happened here tonight, they would all be suspended or fined. </p><p>Nobody spoke as they hopped the fence and made their way through the night. The silent shame was as suffocating as the heat. </p><p>“Was it worth it?” Shirley asked, breaking the awkward silence. </p><p>Agatha removed the stained cardigan from her face and despite the pain radiating behind her eyes and the drops of blood still dripping from her nose, she spoke triumphantly, “Did you see her face when I clobbered that pitch? Yeah it was worth it!”</p>

<span>“Bloody hell.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha woke up to Peggy standing over her staring. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” She tried to open her eyes, but it hurt to even move her eyelids. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You look like you got hit by a truck.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled her pillow out and covered her face, “What time is it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ve got five minutes before we miss breakfast.” Peggy sat at the vanity and applied her lipstick. She liberally applied powder to her face to cover the superficial scratches across her cheeks. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha debated skipping the meal but her stomach forced her up. She stood behind Peggy and looked at herself in the mirror. “Oh god, I can’t go out there like this! Gertie will have a heart attack!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She gently outlined the emerging purple bruises beneath both eyes and across the bridge of her nose. Her right eyelid was swollen and pink, and there was a tiny cut on her cheek. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sit, it’s nothing a little…or a lot of Max Factor can’t cover up.” Peggy moved Agatha’s wavy locks behind her shoulders and motioned her to turn around. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you trying to knock me out again? Can’t you be a bit more gentle?” She complained as Peggy went to work correcting last night’s mistakes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m barely touching you! Toughen up, darling.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a rush job and Agatha’s squirming didn’t help, but it would have to do. Agatha grabbed whatever clothes looked the cleanest in the pile at the end of her bed. Pearl cooked breakfast each morning for the house at 8am sharp. If you missed it, you’d have to settle for a sad bowl of cereal. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re coming!” Peggy skipped down the hall as the living room grandfather clock chimed the top of the hour. Agatha slowly followed behind, feeling the ache behind her eyes with every step. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, well, well, cutting it close today.” Pearl eyed them both suspiciously as she plated the last of the pancakes and slathered them with butter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Take it easy on them Pearly, they won their game last night. Tied the record, right girls?” Gertie poured herself a glass of OJ.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes indeed.” Agatha sat at the dining table and waited for Pearl to bring over the towering stack of pancakes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Gertie looked at Agatha and then did a double take, “Something you want to share with the class?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hmmm?” Agatha avoided eye contact. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy saw Gertie and now Pearl closely observing her friend, “Oh, she caught a nasty foul tip off the bat during batting practice before the game. Hit her square in the nose.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Forget your catcher’s mask?” Pearl wasn’t buying it. She could have been an FBI agent in another life if she had been born in a different time and place. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha coughed as some food caught in her throat. She reached for the juice and chugged it. “Yeah, I was…just…I had left it in my bag.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure.” Pearl said before returning to her breakfast. “Guess it has nothing at all to do with this letter that someone slipped under the door this morning?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She held up a small letter with Agatha and Peggy’s first names scrawled on it. They looked at each other but neither recognized it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy reached across the table and plucked it from Pearl’s hand, “This could be anything. Could be about our upcoming series against the Redwings. Could be a last-minute practice.” She slid her finger between the paper to open the envelope. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched the deep brown eyes scanning the hand-written note in seconds. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Coach is asking us to meet him at the ballpark at 9.” Peggy flipped the note over but it was blank on the back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why?” Agatha asked. They had the day off. Coach never called them in on days off. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Doesn’t say. Here.” She passed over the letter. It was short and vague. Just telling them where to go and what time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Someone’s in trouble…” Gertie taunted them with a smirk. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What? No way! They don’t call me ‘Angel’ for nothing.” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know that nickname has nothing to do with your behavior.” Pearl’s mouth was half full of pancake, but she couldn’t miss the chance to rib her. Agatha scrunched her nose and shot her an angry look. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We should go get ready. We’ve got to leave soon to make it on time.” Peggy shoveled the food onto her fork and worked to clear her plate. Agatha helped clear the table and rinsed the dishes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll handle that, dear. Go.” Gertie waved her away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you get fired, we still expect rent at the end of the month!” Pearl called out as the two retreated to their room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t think…” Agatha started.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now don’t you start too. We don’t even know what this is about! We could be getting a raise for all we know. Lord knows we deserve it.” Peggy pinned her hair back while Agatha rifled in her closet for a nicer dress to wear. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She settled on a pink and white striped day dress that popped with her red lipstick. “Ready?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy nodded, and they headed for the front door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hope the coach isn’t too hard on you two.” Pearl called out from the dining table. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks for all your support!” Agatha snarked as they hit the street and started the walk to the park. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If Shirley ratted on us, I swear to God…they’re going to have to send me to the big house after I’m done with her. They’ll be searching the bottom of Lake Michigan.” Agatha’s mind was racing with fear, and she resorted to her lesser impulses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Keep your hair on, we’ll be fine. Let’s just see what he has to say before we blow our lids.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>They couldn’t see anyone outside when they arrived despite being right on time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where is he?” Agatha looked around but they couldn’t see anyone walking up either. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hear that?” They could hear the sound of someone hitting a baseball, so they entered through the side gate and saw the coach tossing balls up in front of him and trying to hit them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He saw them coming and paused his practice but didn’t move. He stayed next to home plate, which made for an awkward walk over. It was odd seeing him in casual clothing. He was wearing a pair of old jeans and a ruffled collared white shirt. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve never won a championship. Did you know that? In all my years playing, from childhood to the majors and now to coaching. I’ve made it to the playoffs and even the championship game, but I’ve just never been able to clinch it.” He crossed his arms and looked wistfully to the distance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Coach-” Peggy began to speak, but he continued and cut her off. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You girls are playing great baseball. The entire team. Everyone is doing their best. We’re on this incredible winning streak. If we keep going like this, we might really have a shot. Nothing would make me happier than to win it all with the Comets.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, same goes for-” She tried again, but he spoke over her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s what makes what I’m about to say so hard.” He finally looked at them both directly. His eyes lingered at the traces of last night’s mistake. “You are both suspended for the next series. Along with Shirley and Dottie. Rest assured, the Sallies players are also being dealt with by their manager.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Coach! You can’t be serious!” Agatha’s voice rose out of shock. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who told?” Peggy blurted out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think you all forget how small this town is. Did you really think </span>
<b>nobody </b>
<span>would hear a group of drunks loudly playing baseball in the middle of the night? The chief of police lives the next street over!” He pointed his arm out towards the road.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But Coach, we’re on a winning streak. One more game and-” Agatha tried to reason. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And the team is going to have to attempt to win without four of its best players.” He dropped his head and kicked the dirt with his sneaker. The frustration was evident in his body language. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please, we can’t miss four games.” Peggy begged. Agatha watched her hands, which were clenched so tightly they were stark white. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You can and will do whatever I tell you. Actions have consequences. Time to face yours.” He sighed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re sorry.” Agatha offered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, that’s not the first time I’ve heard that from you lately, Harkness. If you want to win this thing, you better get your head on straight because this isn’t like you. Same goes for you, Carter. I would expect this from rookies, but not from you two.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shirley and Dottie don’t deserve the suspension, they were just following us. Please Coach, have a little mercy.” Peggy said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’ve read the rulebook the same as you. Next time they’ll know better.” He clearly wasn’t open to negotiation. They were just going to have to accept this - there was no alternative.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are we free to go?” Agatha was done with this conversation. She wanted a cigarette, she wanted to go home, she wanted to run. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Coach nodded curtly but finished, “You may be suspended from playing, but I expect you at every practice and game. We are still a team.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>They walked out together in stunned silence. Neither spoke until they were out of sight of the stadium. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That knobhead! We’re going to lose our winning streak and for what? Just because we had the audacity to spend time with other players? It’s a load of horseshit, and he knows it! Someone must have told one of the big fellas in management, so now he has to make a show out of us.” Peggy was fuming. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s times like these that remind me why I want to live in a big city one day. The neighborhood gossip is so petty. I hope Shirley and Dottie are okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They should be meeting us at noon. We’re going to see Greta to collect your winnings, remember? We’ll get to hear about what happened with their manager.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh yeah, although at this point I would exchange the money for a spot on the team again. I can’t believe we’re going to miss an entire series.” Agatha hated long breaks. There was nothing worse than being stuck with her thoughts.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They walked through the front door and feared the interrogation that they were probably going to receive. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s the verdict?” Gertie turned around from her lounger in the living room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Four game suspension.” Agatha found long ago that the truth was usually the path of least resistance with their hosts. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Given the state of your faces, I would say that’s generous.” Pearl said, ignoring the dirty looks from the two ballplayers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry girls, that’s too bad. Hopefully, the team can still pull out at least one more win without you.” Gertie tried to find the silver lining. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>At 12, they said they were going out to get lunch at the local diner. Instead, they took a detour to the ballpark again and saw Greta and Carson already waiting. Instead of approaching directly, Peggy waved to get their attention and pointed to the street next to the park. They saw Shirley and Dottie approaching from the other direction and had them follow. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They all walked down the road, and Peggy turned down a small side street. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s with the gumshoe act? Why all the secrecy?” Greta laughed as they gathered next to the florist shop.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did y’all talk with Coach yet?” Dottie turned to Peggy and Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, did he talk with you two?” Peggy asked, and they nodded sadly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We tried to get him to go easy on you both, but he wasn’t having it. The stubborn prick.” Peggy shook her head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I knew this was going to happen! I should have never gone along. Now look at what's happened. I’m a delinquent. My perfect record is ruined!” Shirley threw her hands in the air. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you guys talking about?” Greta exclaimed, stopping all other discussion. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your coach hasn’t talked to you today?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No…what’s up?” Carson looked confused. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ve all been suspended for the next series against Peoria. Someone in town saw us last night and reported us. We don’t know who, but it must have been someone important because we’ve never even heard of a suspension this long before.” Peggy explained the situation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Greta was pacing, “Oh no, are you serious? We haven’t heard anything yet, but our coach is out of town visiting some relatives or something. We haven’t seen him. Are you saying we’re going to be banned too?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Carson’s frown deepened, “Our team is barely holding on. I heard the coach and one of the owners arguing a few weeks ago. If we don’t start selling more tickets and drawing bigger crowds, we might fold. The league may have overexpanded this year, and now they aren’t sure if they can support the new teams.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What!? Why didn’t you tell me?” Greta pulled out her pack of smokes and aggressively pulled one out and lit it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t want anyone to worry. I wasn’t supposed to hear the conversation…” Carson nervously said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s certainly happened before. Remember the Chicks and the Millerettes? They only lasted one year too.” Peggy added. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Greta puffed out a large cloud of smoke, “Not helping!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You never know, you might just get fined. Or the snitch might not have even recognized you all. You might get lucky.” Dottie tried to offer some relief, but they were both spiraling. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Anyway, here’s your dough.” Greta reached into the pocket of her dress and passed over five twenty dollar bills. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks. Do you have a pen? I can write down our phone number. Can you let us know what happens?” Agatha asked. Carson opened her purse and pulled out a small notebook and a pen. Agatha scrawled the number down and passed it back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure, we should get back. We’re heading to Chicago for our next games. We’ll be back in a few weeks, I think.” Greta threw an arm over Carson’s shoulder and led her out to the main road. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait!” Agatha called out and they paused their retreat, “Is Rio okay? I mean, is her hand alright?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Greta had a strange knowing smile on her face when she turned around, “Just bruised, doesn’t seem to be serious. I’ll let her know you were worried.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No…I was just…curious.” Agatha tried to backtrack. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, well, we’ll call you if we get a talking to. We gotta run!” Greta and Carson headed to their hotel. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Anyone else want to drown their sorrows in a large chocolate milkshake?” Peggy raised her hand and the others shrugged and also put their hands up. They headed to the diner to grab some lunch and tried to lessen their anxiety and worries with sweet, delicious greasy food. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>On Thursday, Peggy and Agatha made the usual walk to the stadium. The hours before a game were usually the most exciting as the possibilities still stretched endless in front of them. The tension was always palpable in the locker room. While some players were a ball of nerves before they hit the field, Agatha found it oddly relaxing. She loved the challenge, the adrenaline. </span>
</p><p>
<span>On this day though, this familiar walk felt empty. She wasn’t walking towards the big game. She was walking towards the bench.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They entered the side entrance and went to the locker room. As soon as they walked in, Lilia was tutting at them and shaking her head in disappointment. Nobody else seemed aware of the situation yet. The rest of the team took their spots and started changing. The suspended players also donned their uniforms even though they were not going to play. Lilia grabbed the coach when everyone was ready. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He came stomping through the door, “Helen, Edna, Betty, and Sugar.” He pointed at each of the subs. “You’re all in today.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The back-up players all glanced around, clearly checking if this was a dream or not. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Some of your teammates decided to flout the league rules, and now they will be riding the bench for this entire series.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda shot daggers across the room at Peggy and Agatha, who tried to avoid eye contact. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If we win this game, we will have set a new league record for the longest winning streak. We all practice together, I’ve seen all your talents. You wouldn’t be here if you weren’t the best. So, things may look a little different for a while, but my expectations are the same. Let’s go out there and win!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia posted a copy of the batting order and positions on the cork board on the wall. Everyone rushed to check who the troublemakers were. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Everyone except Wanda, who immediately beelined for Agatha and Peggy. She stood in front of them tapping her foot, not saying a word. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was her!” They both shouted at the same time and pointed at each other. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda remained silent and turned to face Agatha directly. She knew that the older woman was more susceptible to her wills.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What? What do you want us to say? That the Sallies showed up after we were walking out. That they challenged us to a home run contest. That we were drinking. That I slammed one off of Rio and won a hundred bucks. It was just harmless fun.” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah your face really says harmless fun.” Wanda waved her hands in front of Agatha’s face. The make-up could only cover so much. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was an unfortunate…accident.” She tried to defend herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda just shook her head, looking defeated, “How are we going to win now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood and put her hands on Wanda’s shoulders. She looked into her eyes and said,  “Have a little faith in the kids. They could use the playing time, and we’ll be here cheering you on.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a bizarre experience to head out to the dugout with no expectation of playing. Agatha had been a starter since she was first drafted. She helped Helen suit up as catcher. They were both in their 30’s, but Helen had only joined the league this year. She was a teacher by trade and often had to join the season late due to the school year, so she served as a backup infielder and catcher. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m nervous.” She confessed as Agatha handed over the mask. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lupe is pitching. She’ll look after you. You know all the signs, you’re ready.” Agatha tried to reassure her. She had some doubts but at this moment, those were not important. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Helen took a big breath in and out before hustling out to her position. Agatha wished she was heading out too, but Billy rushed over and nuzzled up next to her, happy for the new company in the dugout. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why are you in here, Aggie?” He leaned against her arm and looked up at her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I broke a rule, so now I can’t play.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Like a timeout?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, pretty much, kid. An adult timeout. At least I get to hang out with you and Tommy.” It was a small consolation but at least the twins would provide a distraction. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What did you do?” Tommy skipped over and stood in front of them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wouldn’t you like to know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They both started nodding like bobbleheads. She crooked a finger and motioned them closer. She looked around suspiciously. The other benchwarmers were on the other side of the dugout, but she still lowered her voice to a tiny whisper. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“One of the opposing ball boys wandered a little too close to home plate. He was bumping his gums, talking smack about our team. You know how I feel about trash talkers. I thought the kid needed to learn a lesson. So as he passed me by, I checked left. I checked right. Nobody was looking, so  I grabbed him and took a big bite out of his arm!” The twins gasped out loud and covered their mouths.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had to stifle her own laughter and maintain a serious face, “He ran as fast as his legs could carry him. I thought I had gotten away with it, but the umpire took one look at me and saw the blood running down my chin and suspended me! It’s strictly forbidden to attack other teams, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“MOM!!!” Billy jumped up and ran out into the field while the anthem singer was about to start. Wanda turned immediately and caught her son in her arms as he collided with her legs. Tommy was too busy asking for all the gory details to be scared of Agatha’s tall tale. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda held his hand and shuffled quickly back to the dugout. She glared at Agatha and pushed Billy to sit, “No more scary stories! I leave you with them for one minute…” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You blew my cover, mac. I was just joking!” Agatha jested, trying to win Billy back over, but he was getting comfortable next to Shirley and Peggy instead. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The announcer’s voice came over the loudspeakers, “First batter for the day, the substitute at first base is Betty Mahoney. It’s her first start for the Comets, let’s give her a hand!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You got this Betty!” Peggy cupped her hands beside her mouth and shouted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha saw Betty’s knees shaking slightly. She wasn’t religious, but at that moment, she prayed to any higher power to help Betty. A strikeout was entirely demoralizing, and she didn’t want the sub to feel that pain right now. Not on her first start. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They watched with bated breath as the count climbed to 2-2. On the fifth pitch, Betty swung and grounded one up the middle for a base hit. The entire team cheered from the dugout as she turned and smiled at them from first. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Comets went ahead in the second inning by one run, but the Redwings fought back and tied it up the very next inning. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stay back on the ball, Red. She’s throwing pretty slow, so a lot of the gals have been ahead of the pitches.” Peggy advised Wanda who was up first. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You can do it, Mom!” Tommy exclaimed as she walked out to the batter’s box. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s go, Wanda.” Agatha clapped loudly, trying to hide her desperation. They needed this win. She wanted the team to set the record, to be remembered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The pitcher missed with two balls, then hurled a high fastball. Wanda squared it up perfectly and belted it to the outfield. The right fielder ran, tracking it over her shoulder, but misjudged it and the ball bounced off the back fence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda sprinted to second and let her momentum carry her around towards third. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s going for it!” Dottie stood up from the bench and watched Wanda attempt a triple. It was going to be close. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Gee wizz, she’s brave!” Peggy gasped. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Brave is a nicer word for it.” Agatha joked but hoped that she was wrong. Hoped that Wanda wasn’t making a foolish choice. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The right fielder picked it up and fired it to the cut-off, who turned and threw it as hard as she could to third base. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Get down!” Coach yelled motioning down for her to slide. Wanda couldn’t see the ball, which was flying through the air behind her. She followed the sign and hit the dirt hard and fast. Her spikes hit the base just as the ball flew into the mitt. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Safe!” The field umpire declared to an explosion of applause from the home crowd. Billy and Tommy were jumping and dancing in the dugout, completely overcome with excitement. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That doll is crazy. She’s the real McCoy.” Peggy looked in awe. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda scored on the next hit, and the Comets were able to hold the lead for the next four innings. At the top of the ninth, two outs, the final Redwings batter popped one up into the infield and Horsey caught it for the final out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’ve done it! Just like that, your Kenosha Comets have set a new league record for the longest winning streak!” The announcer wrote the moment into history as the entire stadium gave the team a standing ovation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and the benchwarmers joined the team out on the field, tipping their caps to the crowd and celebrating in a large bear hug. She held in her disappointment at missing the action and tried to just enjoy the moment with her teammates. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Back in the locker room, Coach Grant congratulated them all, “I hope you are all proud of this incredible accomplishment. I know I am. If we keep this up, we could go all the way!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>As everyone dressed and packed their things away, the room slowly cleared out. Wanda got up to go, and Agatha called out, pointing to her leg that was scraped raw from the top of her thigh down to her knee, “Woof, that’s a killer strawberry you got there.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda stopped and turned to Lupe, “Can you give Agatha and I a moment?” The pitcher nodded and hurriedly left.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s cookin’, good lookin’? Agatha teased. She enjoyed a touch of harmless flirting with Wanda. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not now.” She pinched the bridge of her nose like she was fighting off a headache. “I’m not proud of this,” She gestured to the road rash on her thigh from the slide. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You should be! Your crazy baserunning won us this game. You are the reason we have the record.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I shouldn’t have had to be the reason! If you, Peggy, Dottie, and Shirley were in the game we would have won by a landslide. I shouldn’t have to pick up your slack, Agatha!” Wanda’s voice was rising. Agatha very rarely saw the redhead get upset like this. She was normally so composed, so put-together. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not like we planned to get suspended. I would have killed to be out on the field with you tonight.” Her voice was low, trying to hide her shame. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda was not going to let her off easy, “But you weren’t. You left the rest of us to cover for you. You couldn’t ignore your ego for one second to think about the rest of us. You just had to play your little games with that Sallies’ pitcher.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha dropped to sit on the bench. Wanda was standing in exasperated anger, her hands on her hips.. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It wasn’t like that. It was…” Agatha thought about it. She knew the rules, she knew she shouldn’t have been hanging out with another team, she knew it was a bad idea. She wanted to stick it to Rio, nothing more nothing less. She hadn’t thought about the team or anybody besides herself. Wanda was right. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not all of us have your talent. Some of us are just happy to be here, while we can. I’ve wanted to tell you for a while but didn’t know how to say it…but…this is my last season.” Wanda moved to sit beside Agatha. Her anger settling down into exhaustion. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What? Why? You’re a great ballplayer, Red.” Agatha had expected a lecture, but she hadn’t expected this. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not that. It’s the boys. They just turned five. I want them to start school in September. I want them to have a stable home. I don’t want them stuck on a bus for hours every other week, living out of a suitcase, going to practices and games, and travelling constantly. I want to give them a normal life, or as normal as I can make for them.” Wanda swiped at the tears that fell down her cheeks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ever since she had lost her husband, she had put on such a strong front for her sons and for everyone. She seemed invincible, but now Agatha could see just how vulnerable and scared Wanda really was beneath it all. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rubbed her friend’s back and fished a handkerchief out of her bag and passed it over. “Where are you going to go?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve heard New Jersey is pretty nice.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who told you that?” Agatha quipped. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, don’t you start. I’ve already made up my mind. I’ll finish out the season, but that’s it. I’m done. I want to go out swinging. I want to win.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You got it. I didn’t know…I’ll be better. Let’s win this together.” Agatha brought her in for a hug, and they shared a tearful embrace in the quiet of the locker room. </span>

<p>
<span>“Some people use to say, ‘How did you do it? Those long bus rides and all?’ You know, when you’re sixteen years old and you’re doing something you like to do, that was the least of my concerns, the bus ride. It was fun, it was a lot of camaraderie with the girls, we had good times, we had a lot of laughs. . . . I never minded the bus rides.”</span>

<span>The winning streak ended the very next game thanks to a close contest that broke the way of the Redwings, but the record still stood. The Comets were even featured in one of the national newspapers for their accomplishment. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“My daddy is going to be beaming when he sees this!” Dottie held up the clipping at batting practice that afternoon. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going to show everyone back home. This is incredible!” Helen reread the article again. “They even mention me by name!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha went to the newspaper stand to get her own copy to put in her journal. It was a great memento for the season so far. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The team won the third game and lost the fourth. The suspension was finally over for the rule-breakers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re back!” Peggy cheered at the conclusion of the fourth game. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not back until the coach says you’re back.” Lilia quieted the joy, and Agatha stuck her tongue out at the chaperone behind her back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ve been rotting on the bench. Let us have a little fun.” Agatha whined. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia had no time for arguing, “Ladies, we’re off to Fort Wayne tomorrow morning. Bus will be here at the ballpark at 8am. You know the drill: if you miss it, you miss the game. The sun enters Leo tonight, so I foresee a strong showing against the Daisies.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you say so, Lilia.” Peggy said. She was a skeptic and didn’t buy into any of Lilia’s predictions, despite their eerie knack for being right.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That night, Pearl cooked her signature pot roast for dinner. They invited Wanda and the twins over since there were always leftovers. Pearl had grown up with seven siblings and could only cook her meals in large portions. Agatha saw this as the perfect opportunity to mend fences with her teammate. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How do you get this meat so tender? It’s delectable.” Wanda almost moaned when taking a bite of the roast beef. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s all in the cook time. Low and slow for a few hours gets it just right.” Pearl explained. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned over to the boys who were sitting at the corner of the table and spoke in hushed tones, “She actually harvests road kill to make sure the meat is </span>
<em>
<span>extra</span>
</em>
<span> tenderized.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy immediately spit his food out on the plate. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Billy! We don’t spit food out at the table!” Wanda gasped in surprise. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Auntie Aggie said this is road kill!” He cried and pushed his food away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Between the death stares coming from Pearl and Wanda, Agatha put her hands up in surrender, “Just making a joke! Sorry boys, I was just kidding. Don’t listen to me!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Tommy giggled and made a show of chomping down on his meat, but Billy was less convinced. He decided to stick to the potatoes and carrots that he doused in gravy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you gals hear the news on the wire this afternoon?” Gertie asked at the table. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Was it about that new Babe Ruth flick coming out soon?” Peggy wondered. They had all been looking forward to it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Gertie continued, “No, about the league. They’re disbanding the Sallies and the Colleens.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha dropped her fork and knife, which clattered on her plate. “WHAT?!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, apparently their teams have gone belly up. They ran out of cash, and the cities couldn’t support them anymore. The league is considering sending them on the road as travelling teams across the country, but it’s still up in the air.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But what about the players?” Agatha asked. She couldn’t believe this. </span>
<em>
<span>I’ve been waiting for my chance to have a rematch with Rio.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, if they become travelling orphans, they’ll probably keep all the players. Depends what the managers decide, I guess.” Peggy had no clue, but it was a decent estimation. They would likely have to wait to hear just like everyone else. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t believe it.” Agatha was flabbergasted. </span>
<em>
<span>I wanted one more opportunity. Just one more chance. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“At least you won’t have to face that pesky pitcher again!” Pearl added. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, yeah sure.” She replied blankly. She wouldn’t get to face Rio again. She wondered if she would even get to see her again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well at least that knocks out two teams from contention for the playoffs. Ups our chances even further!” Peggy said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s true. Bully for us, I suppose.” Wanda chimed in. Agatha still just pushed her carrots around in a daze. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you fancy your chances to win the pennant?” Gertie asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s a pen…ant?” Billy looked curiously at Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s pennant. One word. And it means the championship flag. If we beat every team, and win the most games. We will win the pennant, which means we are the champions!” She explained. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think our chances are excellent. You heard the last series, even our subs are world-class. At this rate, I wouldn’t bet against us.” Peggy puffed out her chest and raised a fist in the air. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy copied the motion to Tommy’s amusement. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mickey, the bartender, is starting a betting pool for the play-offs. I’ll put some dough on you girls. I know you won’t let me down.” Gertie was one of the more loyal supporters. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Will you finally come to a game if we make it to the championship?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Pearl looked over at her friend, very interested in the answer. Gertie hesitated for a moment, “I’ll definitely consider it greatly.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The table laughed at her non-committal answer, but it was the most positive response she had ever given. Pearl just smiled softly to herself and headed to the kitchen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who’s ready for dessert?” She asked while walking in with her famous strawberry chiffon pie. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Me, me, me!” Tommy was bouncing in his seat. The other adults echoed his calls as well. Everybody was a fan of the sweet Jell-O treat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After indulging in the homemade dessert, Wanda and the boys said their goodbyes and headed back to their place. Peggy and Agatha helped clean up then went off to bed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How about that news from Gertie about the Sallies and Colleens. Such a shame.” Peggy turned over in bed to face Agatha in her’s. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I feel bad for the girls. They probably wanted to win just as much as us. Guess that’s why we never heard from Greta about their punishment. Why bother suspending them when they aren’t even in the league anymore?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh yeah, forgot about that. I doubt it's the last we’ll see of them though. There’s no way another team isn’t going to snap up all that talent.” Peggy said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, with Wanda leaving, we’re going to need someone really good next year. I’m gonna miss that girl.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Me too. I can’t believe she’s going to give this up.” Peggy rolled onto her back and looked at the popcorn ceiling in the room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She wants the boys to have some stability. I get it. I would have given up everything for…well, you know.” Agatha took in a steadying breath as the memory almost came knocking at her door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy didn’t push. She had known Agatha long enough. “Do you think anyone else is going to leave?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hope we can keep everyone together. Coach doesn’t seem sour on anyone. We all get along well. We could maybe use another sub or two in case of sickness or injury, but otherwise, I think we have a solid line-up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She and Agatha had been very lucky to have played on the same team for their entire careers. Most players were traded to other teams that might need their position, or they could be loaned out due to injury or absence, or coaches might just not like certain players and want them gone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The life of a ballplayer was generally out of their hands.</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>On the four hour bus ride to Fort Wayne, Agatha swapped between reading the Disney comics with Billy, playing poker, and chatting with Wanda. They were all masters of distraction after the number of bus journeys they had under their belt. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What kind of job are you going to get in Jersey?” She was still disappointed that Wanda was leaving at the end of the season. She had grown to love her company and the presence of the twins. She was going to miss them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know. I love the radio, maybe I could get a job at the station. I’m sure there must be a lot of those around the city.” Wanda loved to tune into the various weekly programs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That would be real sweet. If you ever want to interview a real ballplayer, I know one you could talk to.” Agatha joked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re right. I bet Peggy would love to be on the radio.” Wanda said slyly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ugh, back to poker I go then.” Agatha popped up and scooted down the aisle to the never-ending poker game in the middle. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She played and lost several hands before getting bored again. She took a short nap for the rest of the trip and by the time she woke up, the bus was pulling up to the hotel. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Freshen up in your rooms, and grab some lunch, We are heading over to the ballpark for the game at 3pm. Lupe, you better not step off this bus in those!” She looked up and down at Lupe, who was still in a pair of jeans. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry, Lilia. One second, has anyone seen my skirt?” The pitcher looked under her seat. It was against the rules for any of the players to be seen in public in pants. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Here!” Dottie held up the old cotton skirt in her hands and passed it over. Lupe just rolled up her pant legs and pulled the skirt over it. Several of the other girls did the same every trip. It made them look like they had gained fifty pounds overnight because of the way the skirt sat over the bulky jeans. A small sacrifice that some were willing to make. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Coach was waiting for them in the lobby with their room keys. Agatha grabbed hers, and she asked, “Did you hear about the two teams that shuttered?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, probably before you did. What about it?” He didn’t seem to be in the mood for idle chit-chat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s going to happen to the players?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s above my pay-grade, Harkness. I haven’t heard anything yet. Not that it’s any of your business anyway.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s just…there are so many skilled players on both teams. We could really bolster our roster with a trade or something.” With Wanda leaving, Agatha knew they were going to need a new infielder, and the Sallies had both Jess and Greta. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have heard that Shaw is quite the catcher.” He cracked a smile. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey now, that position is not up for grabs.” She took the hint and walked away to the elevators. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The game that afternoon felt as easy and natural as ever. They were back to the full line-up with Agatha, Peggy, Dottie, and Shirley back in rotation. There were luckily no hard feelings from the substitutes, who were just grateful for the chance to play the previous games. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha dropped down behind home plate and felt right at home again. There was no place like it. She had the full view of all the action. It was the best seat in the house. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Sugar was pitching and kept the game moving at a fast pace. She didn’t allow for much wasted time between pitches and between batters. At one point the umpire had to call time as he wasn’t in position yet, and she had started her wind-up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They crushed the Daisies 7-0. It was a thorough stomping, and the team was in high spirits. It felt like nothing could stop them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>That is until the next day before the Monday game when one of their starting pitchers took the floor. Babe Nichol stood up and announced that she was three months pregnant and that this series would be her last. She had played on the team for three years but got married to her sweetheart during the off-season. They had all wondered how long she would last. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dean got a job offer back home in Knoxville, so we’re going to leave at the start of August. I just wanted to thank you all for the best time these past few seasons. I’ve enjoyed every second, and if any of you are ever down in Tennessee, please stop by.” She gave a short bow and returned to her locker. Everyone came over to congratulate and speak with her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Betty looked particularly pleased. As the back-up pitcher, she had eagerly awaited her shot on the mound. This would be her moment to finally shine. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re going to miss you, Babe. You were a heck of a pitcher. I’m sure you’ll be just as talented at motherhood. That kid is going to be so lucky to have you as a mum.” Peggy said softly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The first few months are the toughest. Make sure you are sleeping when you can. You can always call me if you need advice.” Wanda offered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks, I’ll hold you to that. I’ve learned so much just watching you with the twins.” She said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If this kid ever tries to mouth off, just nail ‘em with a pillow in the kisser. I bet you could hit a kid from across the room with your control.” Agatha slapped her leg and laughed at the image in her head. Wanda shoved her, and she almost fell off the bench. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We don’t throw things at children, remember Agatha? Don’t listen to her!” Wanda urged Babe who was giggling. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll miss the game, but I’m going to miss this more. All of you girls. I don’t know where I’ll find this again.” She looked at all of the players around her. Agatha caught the small twinkle in her eye. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy comforted her, “I’m sure we’ll see each other in the future. You know where to find us! We’ll always save you a seat.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Babe pitched her last game that night on July 24th, 1948. She allowed one run, but the team put up another dominant win at 5-1. At the end of the game, they hoisted her (gently) onto their shoulders and paraded the winning pitcher around the field. Even the Fort Wayne fans, who filled the stadium, cheered and applauded the opposing team. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The next game was a loss after the Daisies went on a lucky rally in the ninth inning, but the Comets won game four and moved up to the top spot in their division. If they held it for the next month, they were guaranteed the best spot in the play-offs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Winners of the season went straight to the semifinals and could skip the initial games. </span>
</p><p>
<span>On Friday, they were back in Kenosha and practicing for their next run of games against Racine at home. The schedule had been shifted following the loss of two teams. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy and Agatha walked up as usual and greeted their teammates warmly. They all started tossing the ball around while waiting for Coach to arrive. He was never normally late, but they knew the normal routine. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was playing catch with Wanda when she noticed him walking up, but he wasn’t alone. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Is that…?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Oooof.” The ball hit her in the shoulder as she completely missed it with her glove. She couldn’t even register the pain. She was transfixed on the person approaching them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha! Are you alright?” Wanda jogged over. Agatha never missed, she was a catcher after all. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She rubbed her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I</span>
</em>
<em>
<span>t can’t be. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>No. Please, no.</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>Coach Grant walked up and stopped, “Everyone, welcome our new pitcher, replacing Babe. Say hello to Rio Vidal.”</span>

<p>
<span>“I never played on a girls team, ever. I never played softball. I played only with the boys and men—grown men—so I never played with the girls. I figured, how hard could that be? Until I saw that first day of tryouts, and then I realized how hard it could be. These girls could play ball.”</span>

</p>
</blockquote><p>
<span>“This is a joke, right?” Agatha barrelled into the coach’s office after practice finished. Rio had simply observed and helped shag fly balls from batting practice. She was still waiting for her new uniform and was resting her arm. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shut the door.” Coach Grant didn’t even look up from his notebook. He knew this was coming. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s too green. Sure, she can throw the heat, but she’s dangerous. You saw her try to hit me! We don’t need a player like that on the Comets.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s really thanks to your suggestion that she’s here at all.” He smiled, “You made a good point about poaching those orphan players while we had the chance.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I meant to replace Wanda!” Agatha threw her body down into the folding chair.</span>
<em>
<span> I really did make some mistakes in a past life. I caused this?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Little Red is not leaving until the season ends. Babe is leaving this week. We need another pitcher to get us through the play-offs. And who better?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Coach, how am I going to play with her? You know that we don’t get along!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re going to have to learn to get along real quick.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha released a cry of frustration and rage before leaving, afraid she was about to say something she might regret. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As she poured out into the hall, she was face to face with the object of her fury. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood her ground and stared straight into Agatha’s piercing blue eyes, “Here I am. I thought I heard someone talking about me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, eat my ass.” Agatha spat back without thinking. She almost slapped her own hand across her mouth. She had no idea where that came from. She rarely swore, thanks mostly to her staunchly religious mother who loved every opportunity to wash her daughter’s mouth out with soap. Just seeing Ivory Soap on the shelf still made Agatha gag to this day. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio could only laugh at the crass comment, though her steely demeanor faltered for a second, “Am I really that bad?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just stay out of my way, and we won’t have any problems. My team has worked too hard for too long to let you ruin it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t ask to be here, and I’m not going to try to mess anything up. I play to win, Agatha.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hearing her name out of Rio’s mouth was strange. It sounded like a lyric, like a melodic sting. It reverberated under her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was too full of anger to listen to reason, “I’m serious. We have a real shot. If you sabotage our chances at the championship, I’ll…I’ll kill you.” She was only being slightly dramatic. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whoa, whoa. You can’t kill me. Though I wouldn’t mind seeing you try.” Rio smirked. She seemed to enjoy Agatha’s theatrics and penchant for exaggeration. It was apparent that she could stand toe-to-toe with Agatha both on the field and in conversation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grizzled and kept walking to leave, “See you on the field, superstar.” She didn’t look back or wait for a reply. She hustled to the locker room to grab her bag. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy was waiting as she expected. She could instantly see the irritation on Agatha as she stomped into the room, “So it’s true then?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know how I’m going to do it, Peg.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s not some demon from the underworld. She’s just another player. We should try to treat her like anyone else. I’m sure she’s really not that bad.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She drives me wild! I can’t explain it. It’s like she was put here specifically to annoy me.” Agatha shoved her mitt into her bag and zipped it up. They hit the light switch and walked out together. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy said, “I don’t think you’re that important, babe. You said it yourself though, she’s the best pitcher we’ve ever seen. If she’s on our team, we won’t have to go against her. We can sic her on our opponents, it’s perfect.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I guess you have a point.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You guess? I definitely have a point. You’re just too stubborn to hear it.” Peggy laughed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shut up.” Agatha smiled. She would consider giving Rio a chance, but another part of her just couldn’t trust it. She was waiting for the other shoe to drop. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>It was the last Saturday in July, and they had a double header against the Belles. It was a nice mild day, clear skies, with a slight breeze that cooled things down. Lois was starting the first game, and Lupe the second. Rio would come in as a reliever if necessary. </span>
</p><p>
<span>In the locker room, Agatha watched the rookie suiting up in the pastel green uniform for the first time. It was like watching a cat walk on two legs, it seemed so wrong. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Enjoying the view?” Peggy whispered, catching Agatha staring. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I was just…it’s just weird, isn’t it?” She fumbled over her words. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s a Comet now. Don’t make her feel like a freak or something.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The coach came in after they were all standing and ready to take the field, “Let’s have another good game. The Belles are in second place right now and knocking at our door. This is also Rio’s first series with the team, please make her feel welcome. Normal double-header protocol. If you feel too spent after the first game, let me know and I’ll sub you out.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shyly waved from the back of the group. Agatha was surprised by how quiet she was. It could be the shock of the new environment and anxiety around a new team, but here, she was much less intimidating than she was on the field. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ready to go, Flo?” Agatha nudged the starting pitcher as they strolled out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ready as ever. How about that rookie pitcher? How lucky are we! She’s a real get for the team.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t have to worry. No one could replace you!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know. I think she could, but I don’t mind. I could use a rest now and then!” Flo was only a year and a half into her pro career, but pitching was incredibly tough on the body. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The game kicked off, and it was clear that the Belles were going to be fierce competition. Their first three batters all got on base. Even with an impressive double play between the infielders, the opposition went up by one in the first inning. </span>
</p><p>
<span>By the fourth inning, the Belles were leading 3-0. They had Flo’s number. Coach Grant had seen enough, and he called a time out. Agatha pushed her mask up and watched the conversation. Flo did not look pleased.  </span>
<em>
<span>Is he pulling her already?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Coach walked with her to the dugout, and Rio came out in her place. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Well, here we go. </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha thought. The two had practiced a little but nowhere near enough. They didn’t even have the signs down. </span>
<em>
<span>This will be interesting.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had the game ball, so she decided to walk up to the mound and hand it to Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What signs do you use?” She asked the pitcher. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The usual. One for fastball, two for curve, three for change-up, four for a knuckleball.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have a knuckleball?” Agatha asked in surprise. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The curves of Rio’s mouth lifted, “I try to save it for special occasions.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was intrigued but knew they didn’t have long, “Alright, let’s keep it simple today. I won’t bother with anything complicated. Just try to trust my calls okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded. She looked a little nervous, which was surprising given her normal overwhelming cockiness. Agatha handed the ball over, “I’ve seen your stuff, you’ll be fine.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She jogged back to her position. Rio walked a small circle around the rubber and then stood tall. They had a minute or so to warm-up before the game restarted. Agatha called for a fastball. Rio stared straight into the catcher’s eyes. Her gaze was so intense, Agatha felt it like it was reaching out and touching her. She watched the pitcher throw her hands back over her head and extend her leg, then fire the ball. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Ouch! Wow. </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha felt the sting in her palm from the power of the pitch. Even with her thick mitt, Rio was throwing at such fast speeds that it did little to blunt the force of impact. She was going to need to really focus on how she was catching these pitches, otherwise she wasn’t going to be able to feel her hand at the end of the game. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She took a few more before the next Belle batter stepped up. She knew Winnie from past seasons. The center fielder had a strong throwing arm but was weak at the plate. Agatha threw down a two, outside. Rio nodded and wound up. She placed it perfectly - a sweeping curveball right on the edge of the strike zone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Strike!” The umpire called and Agatha saw the pitcher light up. </span>
<em>
<span>She really loves this. </span>
</em>
<span>It was so obvious in the way Rio relished each strike. Every batter was a new battle, and she loved the fight, loved to win. Not unlike Agatha in many ways. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She dropped a one, and Rio fired a fastball down the pipeline. The batter swung late and fouled it off. Two strikes. Agatha called it again, and Rio nodded without complaint. </span>
<em>
<span>She’s listening to me. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The final ball was perfect. Agatha marveled at the speed and placement. It was at the knees and had such velocity that the batter didn’t even have time to think about swinging. Out. Agatha grinned and threw the ball back to Rio. They made eye contact, and Agatha caught the genuine smile that reached Rio’s big brown eyes. It was so different from the arrogant grin that she normally put on. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I could get used to this. </span>
</em>
<span>Striking out a batter was incredibly difficult but oh so satisfying when the pitcher pulled it off. Rio gave her a short nod as if to convey her thanks, and Agatha nodded back. A silent exchange that felt as weighty as any conversation. They had a long way to go to overcome their past encounters, but this was a decent start. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shut out the rest of the batters in the inning and didn’t allow a single hit. Agatha was more than impressed.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Great work out there, Vidal.” She offered as they entered the dugout. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced over, “Thanks, not so bad yourself. You really know the opposition.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Being an old-timer has its perks.” She explained and then went down to the end of the bench and removed her gear. Wanda joined her as usual. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was some display out there. You two look real sweet together.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy jumped in, “Yeah, Angel. We need to get Rio a matching nickname. Is the Devil too on the nose?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They all cracked up at the joke, and Agatha said, “I was preparing for the worst, if I’m honest. But…I think she wants to win as badly as we do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Coach is no fool. He wouldn’t sign her unless she was serious.” Wanda said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s see if she’s got the stamina. Any good pitcher can last one inning, the greats still got it after a hundred pitches.” Agatha sat down and watched Fossey at bat. They were still down by three and needed a strong attack to be able to come back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was sitting with the other pitchers. They tended to flock together. Birds of a feather and all that. Agatha glanced down and saw her chatting with Lupe. She heard that they were rooming together with Horsey at the Smith house. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She seemed to have such a natural charisma about her. Agatha watched the other players gravitate toward her and try to join the conversation. She was brand-new, which was always a big draw, but it was more than that. There was a feeling that she might say anything, an unguarded danger to her that was intriguing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha considered going over but still felt a wall up between them. There was something unspoken that she couldn’t nail down. That strange pull that made Rio try to knock her head off upon their first meeting or made Agatha forget every rule. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, she watched Fossey hit a hard single and get on base. Followed by Buckets hitting an unfortunate pop-up to the shortstop, and then Betty stepping in as a pinch hitter and getting a single. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s go, Dottie! You got this!” Agatha stood up and leaned against the dugout fence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dottie turned and beamed a toothy smile before setting herself at the plate. Two pitches went by and the count was 1-1. The coach tipped his cap and subtly grabbed his elbow - their sign for a bunt. Dottie waited until the timing was right and bunted the ball perfectly down the first base line. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Fern was off immediately and slid into third safely. Betty made it to second and Dottie was thrown out on a successful sacrifice play. Wanda was up next and primed to bring in the runners. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Bring ‘em home, Red!” Peggy shouted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Go, Mom!!” Billy screeched out to the amusement of the entire dugout. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda looked as cool as ice. She handled pressure well and never seemed to crack. On the very first pitch, Agatha could tell that Wanda was going to swing. The bat connected right on the barrel and the ball shot out to the outfield. The left fielder sprinted for it, but it landed in the corner of the field. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The two lead runners scored as the fans hollered and cheered in the bleachers. Wanda waved at the twins from second, who excitedly pointed and waved back with pride. The Comets were only down by one run. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Tommy turned to Agatha and tapped on her arm repeatedly, “Are we gonna win?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you think so?” She asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, yes, yes!” He joyfully yelled and the gals all joined his chant until everyone was shouting “Yes!” Agatha looked over and saw Rio chanting along too. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Horsey hit a single, which brought Wanda home and tied up the game. Peggy flied out, but the entire team was buzzed with energy from the great inning. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s hold them.” Rio said as they walked out to the diamond together, and Agatha could only nod. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was struck by Rio’s singular focus and determination to win. She watched the pitcher. It was like seeing a bird arriving at its nest. She was at home on the mound; it looked so natural. She commanded it like a captain at sea. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It didn’t erase everything, but if they were stuck together now, she might as well try to move on. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat down the first two batters in just six pitches. The third hit a liner to Wanda who easily plucked it from its trajectory and got the final out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The Comets scored once more in the eighth inning, and Rio continued her stellar debut all the way until the final out. Her first win in the books. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“A round of applause for our new pitcher, Rio Vidal! Don’t forget to stick around as our Comets will be facing off against the Belles again in just one hour!” The announcer said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The crowd stood on their feet as the team departed the field. Rio waved her cap to the fans, who were shouting her name. Agatha wasn’t the only one impressed today. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Back in the dugout, Coach Grant addressed them, “That’s what I’m talking about Comets! It’s one thing to destroy another team, it’s another to come from behind and take the win from them. No small thanks to Vidal for that unbelievable performance. Rest up while you can. Lilia brought sandwiches from the deli if you’re hungry. Lupe, make sure you’re warmed up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The team walked into the locker room and saw a platter of subs and fruit waiting. Lilia always knew exactly what they wanted. The folks at the deli were big fans and loved catering for their ball club. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grabbed half a turkey and cheese and sat in one of the foldable chairs in the room, stretching her legs out onto the bench in front of her. Peggy and Wanda joined her. The twins were too busy playing tag with each other in the hallway to sit still. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How’s your hand, Angel? It looked like Rio wasn’t letting up all game.” Wanda asked between bites. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked down at her left palm. The angry red splotches were fading, “Sometimes it feels like I’m trying to catch a bullet. When it hits the wrong part of my glove, I swear I can feel it in my spine.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>They laughed. Peggy scanned the room, “Hey Rookie, come sit with us!” She waved Rio over, who was grabbing a sandwich from the table. At first, she looked behind her to see if Peggy was talking to some other rookie but then realized it was her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She walked over and grabbed a seat. It was very strange for Agatha to see her two best friends sitting with her recent adversary turned teammate.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So…I’ve been dying to ask. Where ever did you learn to pitch like this?” Peggy leaned forward and asked before popping a grape in her mouth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at them all, enjoying the attention, “My parents said I could chuck my binkie clear across the living room before my first birthday.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>It sounded plausible until Rio's face broke and she burst out laughing, causing a chain reaction amongst the group. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought you were serious for a second there!” Wanda gasped, trying not to choke on her sandwich. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry, you guys are too easy. In all seriousness, I grew up with seven cousins, all boys. Every single moment of daylight, we spent playing baseball in the street. My uncle showed me how to throw, and my eldest cousin taught me the basics of pitching. When they wouldn’t let me play with them, I would throw pitch after pitch at the brick wall behind our house. I swear that wall looks almost like a slice of swiss cheese, there are so many dents in it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn’t play in school or any organized teams?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The first uniform I ever put on was for the Sallies. There weren’t any girl’s sports at my school, and I didn’t know of any in my town. The baseball teams wouldn’t let me join.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow, no kidding? Where did you learn the rules and everything? It seems like you’ve been playing for years.” Agatha couldn’t believe that Rio just appeared out of nowhere with this level of skill. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve been surrounded by baseball my whole life. There was always a game on the radio, and we would go see the local team play for free on weekends.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who do you follow in the majors?” Wanda asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Cubs.” Rio replied. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groaned and failed to hide her disgust, “Why?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“My uncle loved Hack Wilson, and then they drafted the first Puerto Rican player in the MLB, Hiram Bithorn. What a pitcher. I tried modeling my wind-up after how the papers described his. I think the whole island supports the Cubbies.” Rio said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought you were from Florida?” Wanda asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was born in Puerto Rico, but grew up and lived in Florida for most of my life. What are your favorite teams?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Reds” Wanda said proudly, flipping her scarlet hair over her shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Red Sox.” Peggy and Agatha spoke simultaneously. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m so sorry.” Rio held her heart and offered her condolences. “I can see why you are both so desperate to win. This is probably the only championship you’ll be able to celebrate for a while.” The Red Sox had been on a notorious drought since selling Babe Ruth to the Yankees in 1918. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You wound me. Now remind me, when’s the last time the Cubs won the World Series?” Agatha put her hand up to cup her ear, waiting for a response. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio scowled and took a big bite of her sandwich to silence her frustration. (The Cubs hadn’t won a title since 1908). </span>
</p><p>
<span>“These three aren’t bothering you are they?” Lupe came over and looked to Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, it’s not like we’re casting a spell on her or anything!” Agatha said to Lupe’s amusement. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, the pitchers are going to start warming up in 10 minutes, okay? You coming too, Agatha?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, “Yes, boss. Let me just finish my meal.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The pitchers and catchers wrapped up early to go practice before the next game started. The crowd had mostly dispersed though a few stragglers lingered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey Rio! Hey!” Someone yelled out from the stands. “Your curves are almost as good as the ones you throw!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>All the girls were used to indecent jeers. The first few years were the worst for it. Men who had no concept of women ballplayers and no cognitive skills to process that new information. Instead they would run their mouths and hurl insults and jabs. Most were just trying to get attention, some trying to get a date, and some just angry old fools. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It had been a while since they’d had to deal with any, especially at a home game where the shame of a neighbor’s stare was usually enough to stop it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked out into the stands and caught the eye of the guy. She knew most of the regulars and clocked him immediately, “Does your mom know you’re here, Glen? I’m not sure she would like you speaking to a lady like that!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>His buddies cracked up at Agatha’s comment, and she saw his ears tint red. He stood up, “Shut up, Angel. I wouldn’t touch you with a ten foot pole!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is that a promise?” She snarked back and kept walking, turning her back to the petty argument and pulling her catcher’s mask down. She saw Rio smirking but silent as the pitcher kept walking to the warm-up mound. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Helen kneeled beside her, catching for Rio, while Agatha practiced with Lupe, who was starting. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“One day that mouth is going to get you in trouble.” The other catcher said between pitches. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you don’t confront these chuckleheads, they’ll think they can speak to us like that. It’s not right. We have to stand up for ourselves - it’s not like anyone else is going to. You’re too far inside, Lupe!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t feel my hand.” Helen removed her glove for a second and tried to stretch her fingers out. Rio’s pitches could feel like catching a brick. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have to try to catch it in the webbing. It’ll feel strange at first but it will lessen the sting.” Agatha advised. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The second game started with the same intensity of the last. The two teams were equally matched and fighting hard to win. Lupe held her own and went the whole nine innings. Shirley scored in the sixth thanks to a double from Agatha, and the Comets recorded back-to-back wins. Coach released them for the night and gave them the next morning off before their next game tomorrow night. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As Agatha pulled her bag onto her shoulder in the locker room, Rio put a hand up to catch her eye, “Agatha, can I talk to you for a minute?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll see you at home, Peggy.” She urged her roommate on and set her bag back down. Peggy gave her a questioning look, but Agatha tried to reassure her with several quick nods. She could handle herself without it devolving to blows. She hoped anyway.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was leaning against the row of lockers, arms crossed, biting her lip. An unnatural silence stretched between them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha threw her hands up, “Well? I thought you had something to say.” She was tired and dirty. She didn’t particularly want to spend any more time at the ballpark. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio caught the catcher’s gaze and Agatha felt that intensity again. Whether it was the size of her eyes or the heat behind her stare, it was hard to say, but Agatha fought the urge to look away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just wanted to apologize…truly. I’m sorry for how I treated you. It wasn’t fair.” Rio stared directly into Agatha’s steely blues. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s your deal? What did I do to piss you off?” Agatha dropped back to lean against the column in the center of the room, a few paces away from where Rio stood. She was very anxious to hear the answer. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio started and stopped herself a few times before finally letting out, “It wasn’t you…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t give me that ‘it’s not you, it’s me’ crap.” Agatha groaned. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah okay, it was you.” She admitted, putting her hands up in front of her, “That was my first game. My first time ever pitching professionally. I wanted to be noticed. I didn’t want to be some forgettable newbie that people wrote off as just another rookie without a clue.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was staring down at the ground now, kicking her feet against the concrete. She continued, “Your reputation preceded you. I remember seeing your photo and reading about you in </span>
<em>
<span>LIFE magazine</span>
</em>
<span> back when the league first started. </span>
</p><p>
<span>I was working the night shift at the shipyard in Miami, helping fix and maintain the Navy cargo ships. I dreaded every single second at work and would daydream that I was anywhere else. One of my coworkers was reading the latest </span>
<em>
<span>LIFE</span>
</em>
<span>, and I saw all you gals on the cover in your uniforms. I read the article at least a dozen times on my break - I couldn’t believe that there were other women out there who could play ball and that you were getting paid for it!</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a picture of you at bat, and I ripped it out and kept it in my locker. It was my wish, my guiding light that maybe, just maybe, there was a better life out there for me. That one day I could see that sight, you, in real life, from the pitcher’s mound. That one day I wouldn’t be sweating in my coveralls, squinting through my welder’s mask, and counting down the seconds until my shift ended. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When I finally got here, everyone talked about you. The Angel on the Comets - home run leader, MVP two years in a row, All Star catcher, and one of the highest batting averages in the league. You’re everything I want to be. You represented all my lost time, and I let my jealousy take over. It was stupid - I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took it all in. She had never considered how other players perceived her, not really anyway. She had been so singularly focussed on winning and avoiding her past that she hadn’t paid much attention to much else. It wasn’t until Rio flew into the picture that she had thought something about a competitor besides their stats. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow, so…you kept a photo of me in your locker?” Agatha pursed her lips and thought she noticed a very faint blush coloring Rio’s cheeks. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s your takeaway? I pour my heart out for the first time in my life, and all you can focus on is that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry! It’s just…cute. The thought of you…staring at my big mug, dreaming of striking me out. You’re a real softie under that aloof exterior you put on.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio dipped her head and ran a hand through her dark brown hair casually, avoiding eye contact now, “Well…do you have anything to say to me?” She looked up at Agatha like an expectant puppy, waiting for a treat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What? I thought this was your apology. I already wrote you one, remember?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was a very sad excuse. I ripped it up when my coach gave it to me. I knew you didn’t mean a word.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha barked out a laugh at that, “Yeah, I was forced to write it, but I did overreact. I shouldn’t have laid a hand on you. I took it too far. Though, I can’t say you didn’t deserve it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How about a truce? What if the ballpark is Switzerland? When we’re playing, let’s put all that aside. I want to win. I want to win with you.” Rio stepped forward and extended her hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked down at it - the long fingers, red dirt beneath her nails, calluses dotting her palm - definitely a pitcher’s hand. She felt her heart start to pound and hoped her own hand wasn’t sweating. </span>
<em>
<span>Why am I nervous?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She grabbed Rio’s hand and shook it confidently. They were both squeezing a tad harder than normal, attempting to project some image of strength, but smiling through it, knowing exactly the game they were playing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Deal. You know what they say? Keep your friends close….” Agatha was the first to let go and went to grab her bag.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Am I your enemy?” Rio cut her off and picked up her own bag. She started walking out as Agatha trailed behind. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not anymore.”</span>

<p>
<span>“When I walked in, I was stunned . . . to see all these other girls my age throwing the ball like I did, swinging, running, sliding—and I thought, ‘Where did all these gals come from?!’”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>Dolly Niemiec</span>
</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>
<span>“You can’t play with us!” The group of 8-year-old boys snatched the sad excuse for a baseball from Rio’s hand. At this point, the ball was more electrical tape than anything else. It was holding onto its last legs, but it was all they had. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was 7. She looked to her cousin, Christian, for help, but he wouldn’t even look at her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s not even a baseball mitt.” The leader of the pack, Roberto, said with a sneer, looking with disdain at the makeshift glove that Rio’s aunt had repurposed from one of her uncle’s bricklaying gloves. It was cut, patched and sewn to fit her small hand. They couldn’t afford anything else. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on, let’s go.” Her cousin said in an effort to lead them away. “Don’t follow us.” He murmured at her quietly as they retreated. He took a big drink of cola and turned to follow the group of ten. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She watched them walk away together and couldn’t understand why she wasn’t allowed to join. She played outfield when all the cousins played together. She could hit, and she could definitely throw. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt she was about to burst. It was like when her aunt made her wear long dresses or when her teachers smacked her hands with a ruler for daydreaming in class. Without thinking she grabbed a rock from beside the brick wall and aimed it for her target. She used her full energy, leaned back, and chucked it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“AHH!” her cousin jumped as the glass bottle he was holding at his side exploded in a shattering crash.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio spun and bolted in the opposite direction, cackling with glee. </span>
</p><hr/><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Three months ago - May 1948</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Come on, Rio! You’re going to miss it!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The two women ran along the sidewalk to reach the Dade County train station. Rio checked her watch, two minutes until 9am. They had to make it. She needed to get there - her arms pumped faster despite the weight of her suitcase in one hand and her gear on her back </span>
</p><p>
<span>They tore past the ticketing booth as Rio’s uncle had already secured her ticket weeks ago and burst out onto the platform. The train was roaring to life and people were already leaning out the windows, waving goodbye to their loved ones, twirling their white hankies in the air. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The 9 o’clock to Chicago via Atlanta is departing platform 1.” A detached voice announced. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned, huffing and out of breath, and threw her arms around her best friend, “I’m going to miss you, Jen. I’ll write to you. I’ll tell you everything. Come visit if you can. I don’t know how I’m going to do this without you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen squeezed Rio tightly, then stepped back and levelled a glare, ‘You’re the best pitcher I’ve ever seen, Vidal. Show ‘em what you got. Don’t let anyone make you feel like you don’t belong. If any of those gals give you grief, give it right back, okay? I’m just a call away. I’ll look after the cousins for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you…just thank you for everything. I-” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Go, you fool! It’s leaving!” Jen pushed Rio onto the steps of the train as it started to pull away. Rio ran her arm across her eyes to catch the falling tears and waved to her oldest friend. She had never been away from home before. She had never been north of Orlando in her life. This was her first train ride at the age of 26. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was surreal. She couldn’t believe she was actually on her way to her new life, her new career as a professional baseball player. It was only a month ago that Jen had seen an advertisement in the local paper about the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. They were desperately searching for pitchers who could throw overhand. This was her shot.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She had wanted to go for it five years ago, but she was needed at home. Her three older cousins were all drafted, and she had to help her Aunt take care of the house. There were four younger cousins, and her wages at the shipyard helped pay for the ever-increasing cost of groceries and essentials. She couldn’t just leave. But the war was over now, things were slowly getting back to normal. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she saw the ad, Jen got her boss to call the scout and pretended to be Rio’s coach. He said Rio was the best pitcher in town and dominated their local league. It was not entirely untrue but certainly not the truth either. Rio had never played on any legitimate team before. Miami didn’t have any women’s softball leagues and none of the baseball teams would ever draft a girl. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The lie worked, and Rio was granted a trial with a new team in the league, the Springfield Sallies. She would have to travel up to Illinois, and a contract was not guaranteed but if they liked her she would be in. They were offering $55 a week for rookie players and a daily meal allowance. It was certainly more money than she was earning here at a job she hated. </span>
</p><p>
<span>What did she have to lose?</span>
</p><p>
<span>A chance was all she needed. She explained it all to her Uncle Hector, who was as thrilled as she was. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mija, this is amazing! I’ll buy your train ticket. One-way. I just know that you won’t be needing a return pass.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No way, I have my savings from work. I can pay for it.” She knew it was going to be a losing argument but had to try. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Never turn down a gift, Rio. I want to do this for you. In return, I expect a good seat when I come up to see you. We’ll find a way if you make it to the championship. Deal?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course. Thank you, thank you, thank you.” She felt so full of joy and gratitude that she didn’t know what else to say. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Now she was on her way. Off to a new city, a new state, a new beginning. She found an empty seat in the middle of the carriage and stored her luggage in the rack above. She stared out the window, imagining what awaited her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Norma Walsh greeted Rio at the Chicago Central Station, “Ms. Vidal? I’m Norma, the chaperone for the Sallies. I’ll drive you to town and escort you to the Corner Inn where you’ll stay for the next few days. If you make the team, I’ll arrange you a room with a local family.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was exhausted from the train journey. It had taken a whole day, and she longed to lay down in a bed. “Thank you, ma’am. What does a chaperone do for the team?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“None of that ma’am stuff. Just Norma is fine. And we handle most of the logistics like lodging and transportation. I look after all the girls on the team. Part medic, part counsellor, part coach, part mother. It certainly keeps me on my toes.” She led them to her old Ford and popped the trunk. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The next morning, Rio reported to the field early to join the team for practice. There were five other women vying for a spot on the team. She overheard their small talk but kept to herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve been playing for my company team for three years. I throw mostly side arm.” One boasted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I played softball all four years of high school, but I can also throw overhand. It’s just not as controlled as my windmill pitches.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have y’all seen the ball they’re using? It’s almost down to a baseball in size. I’ve never played with a ball so small before.” Another lamented, the tone of worry evident in her voice. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio just stood and stretched her glove open and closed. The well-worn leather answered her every command. It was like a second skin at this point. She had inherited it from her eldest cousin, Esteban, when she had turned 15. It was marginally too big, but at this point, she knew its every quirk and trait like a mother knows her child. It was a far cry from the bricklaying glove she grew up using. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The main players from the Sallies joined them on the field followed by the coach and the chaperone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Today we’ll be practicing as usual, but also trying to find at least two new pitchers for our bullpen. These five will be throwing batting practice for the rest of you. I’ll be evaluating each and taking in all of your feedback at the end. We’ll also run fielding drills to see if they might be better suited to other positions.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched the first three newbies give it their best shot. They each pitched to four batters and attempted for strike-outs. The Sallies were good, surprisingly so. She watched the first baseman, Greta Gill belt one all the way to deep outfield and then the shortstop, Jess McCready, shot a rocket right over second base. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her nerves started to rise. She knew she could strike out the guys from the neighborhood in their back-alley games, but this was for real. This wasn’t just schoolyard pick-up, these women were professionals. Could she actually do this? </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Next! Rio Vidal! Did I say that right?” Coach yelled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, sir.” She said under her breath and walked out to the mound. She pushed down every doubt and tried to summon all the poise she could muster. She thought about the broad from the magazine. Agatha? That gal would never be scared, would never show fear. Rio pretended she was that woman in the picture as she caught the ball and delivered her first pitch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With the first throw, she felt everyone turn and look. With the second, she silenced all chatter. With the third and final strike, she knew she belonged. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She hadn’t even left the mound when the Coach shook her hand and offered the position, starting immediately. She had struck out three in a row and only allowed a single from the catcher, Carson Shaw. Only one other pitcher made the squad as a back-up outfielder and emergency reliever.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where did you come from? I don’t think there is anyone in this league that can throw as hard as you just did.” Carson came up to Rio after practice finished. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks, I’m from Florida. I played ball in the streets of Miami ever since I was old enough to walk. I can’t believe I’m going to get paid to do this.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It never goes away. That feeling. I’ve been playing for five years and sometimes I still pinch myself. These years have been the best of my entire life. It’s changed me, for the better” Carson said. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>Rio ended up rooming with the other rookie, Grace Strickland. Norma set them up with a young married couple, who had two spare rooms and were saving for a baby. The house was nice enough. Rio knew she wasn’t going to see much of it. She intended to sleep here and spend every other waking second practicing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn’t here for a vacation. She was here to win. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jen? Can you hear me?” Rio was on the payphone outside the ballpark after her first official practice wearing the uniform. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio! I’m guessing you made it since you haven’t come back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, they signed me for the season. Can you believe it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I knew it! Do you have to wear those ridiculous uniforms?” Jen asked. They had laughed at the photos of the players when they first saw them years ago. How was a ballplayer meant to play in a skirt?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Unfortunately, yes. We can’t even wear pants in public! But they pay the salaires, they make the rules. I’m not about to argue!” Rio preferred trousers, especially on the field, but when the choice was playing pro ball in a skirt or going back to her laborious job in pants, she knew what she would pick. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Gosh, did I send you to play ball or to the drill academy? I didn’t know they were so strict…anyway, where ya livin’?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They got us staying with a couple in town. I can walk to the ballpark, which is handy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re not…weird, are they? What’s a couple doing letting two young gals into their abode?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, Jen. They seem fine. They get rent money from us, so it’s a nice deal for them. I’m barely there anyway. I only go there to sleep.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right, well if that fella tries anything funny, remember to throw punches first, ask questions later. Got it?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio couldn’t help but laugh at her friend’s bluntness, “I can take care of myself. You taught me everything I know. I gotta run, but I’ll talk to you after my first game in a few weeks.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll be waiting by the phone. Have fun, kid.” Jen said and hung up. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>Rio rode the bench at first. The coach wanted her to get a feel for the game and watch before throwing her into the deep end. She didn’t mind either. It was nice to ease into things and observe the game up close. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She took note of the pacing, the subtle cues and rituals, the spoken and unspoken rules, and the players. It was like watching a complicated dramatic theatrical production. Everyone had their roles, and the game moved in a delightfully unpredictable, choreographed dance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was very clear from the start that the Sallies were facing an uphill battle. The other teams were much more in sync and clearly had years of experience under their belts. Every team was struggling with the pitching change, but a strong defense could make up for a lot of problems on the mound. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Sallies did not have a strong defense. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They had good players, great even, but a team was forged in repetition and practice. They simply didn’t have as much time to grow together as the others did. They were a ragtag group of transfers and recruits. Greta was top-tier at first base, but the other infielders often threw it just out of her reach. Jess was incredibly athletic and a perfect fit for short-stop, but she didn’t cover second base in key situations. Cookie in left field could catch anything hit her way, but her arm let her down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was the little things that added up and resulted in losses. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Coach Doyle was trying to give the veteran pitchers time to adjust and settle into the team, but by July, the scoresheet was painful to look at. On the Friday before their next series, he approached Rio after batting practice. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you ready?” He looked at her directly, which took her aback at first. He rarely addressed her one-on-one. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She raised an eyebrow, “For…what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“To play tomorrow.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio held in a gasp. This was it - what she had been waiting for. Her debut. “Yes, I’ll be ready, Coach.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He nodded curtly and left her standing there, in disbelief. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Greta rushed over and snaked an arm around her shoulder, “Couldn’t help but overhear. Congrats, Rookie!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Carson was suddenly at her other side, “Maybe we can finally win a game this season if you’re out there with us.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt shy under their praise. She wasn’t used to this type of camaraderie. “I’ll try anyway. Who are we playing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Comets.” Carson replied. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ooooooh, watch out for Angel. She’s their catcher. Big time power at the plate. Most pitchers choke when she steps up, so don’t let her get in your head. Even though it’s hard to forget her good-looks.” Greta winked at Carson, and Rio saw something pass between them that she couldn’t quite pin down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’ve also got Peggy and Wanda. Those two do anything to get on base. They’ll chase pitches and somehow hit them way outside the zone. The Comets are very aggressive on offense. We’ll need to be at our best.” Carson was a veritable gold mine of facts on other teams and players. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt the nerves start to dial up in her stomach. She knew she had the skill, but there was a difference between knowing it and showing it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ve got your back, chickadee. Just throw like you do in practice, and you’ll blow them away.” Greta tried to calm down the panic that she could see behind Rio’s eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>On game day, Rio watched Ruth pitch the first few innings. The Comets were chewing her up and spitting her out. Every inning they scored at least one run, and by the third inning, Rio started warming up her arm. She knew she would be called in at any moment. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Vidal. You’re in.” Coach waved her on after pulling Ruth in the fourth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She closed her eyes for one second and allowed herself to savor this moment. Her first game, her first time taking the field as a professional baseball player. She tried to soak it all in and remember every little thing - the way her fingers felt in the well-worn grooves inside her mitt, the smell of grass, dirt, and sweat, the sun on her skin, the chatter of the crowd. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She opened her eyes and took the field. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Staring down the pipe, she watched Carson for the signs. She ignored the batter entirely, and just looked at the catcher’s mitt, her target. One, two, three. Just like that, her first strikeout. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The crowd roared, and she did the first thing she could think of - she dipped down for a royal bow. Fans hollered their approval at the gesture, and she relished in the applause. She felt strong, she felt worthy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The next batter made her way out. She heard the announcer call her name. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Angel. Agatha Harkness. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman from the picture. </span>
</p><p>
<span>This was the singular moment she had dreamed about. The fantasy that had carried her through years of hard labor, endless back-breaking shifts, and pitts of lonely despair. Pitching against the batter from the magazine. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was happening. This was real. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She inhaled long and slow through her nose, holding the air in her lungs, trying to settle her suddenly shaking hand. Carson called for a curveball. Rio nodded and started her wind-up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She felt it leave her hand a split second early and let out a soft groan of frustration as it landed inside for a ball. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re the best pitcher I’ve ever seen…” Jen’s words circled in her mind like a mantra. She let the affirmation fuel her. The catcher threw down a one - fastball. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The speed was there, but the placement was high. Another ball. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was crowding the plate, making it difficult to land the pitches where she wanted them. The umpire had a tight strike zone and wasn’t giving much leeway. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched the batter step out and heard her scoff. The sound cut through her bones. She was writing her off, dismissing her with a single noise. Rio paced in a circle to try and stamp down the growing flame inside. Her hands started to twitch, and she wiped a bead of sweat that raced down her temple. </span>
</p><p>
<span>This is not how she saw this going. She had played this moment in her head ten thousand times. She used to close her eyes before bed and think of the pitches she would throw, how the crowd would cheer, how her teammates would celebrate when she threw the final strike. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It wasn’t supposed to happen like this. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took her stance again. Rio visualized the next pitch in her mind. She saw Carson’s call and focussed on the catcher’s large, waiting glove. Her eyes flicked to the batter. Big mistake. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She winked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio’s mind went blank. Her old pal, anger, was back. Before she could stop herself, the ball had left her hand aimed directly at the source of her anger. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh no. Oh fuck no. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hit the deck to avoid the incoming projectile. Rio’s dream turned into a nightmare as the woman from the magazine launched off the page right into her face. She couldn’t even register the words blasting from her mouth. It was too surreal. She was starstruck. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When it was clear that she had been asked a question, she could only shrug as she didn’t know what had been said. Next thing she knew she was flat out on the dirt. Rio couldn’t register any pain. She didn’t know why she was on the ground. All she could do was smile like an idiot at the raging batter in front of her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She had finally found worthy competition. Someone who would actually challenge her skill. Someone who gave as much of a damn. Someone who could make her a better pitcher. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha Harkness. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She watched the batter be thrown out of the game. A shame, but she knew they would meet again. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>“Who’s coming with us to the motherfucking bar?” Greta shouted out in the locker room as the gals were drearily getting dressed after the loss.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know I’m in.” Carson smiled. “You coming, rookie?” She looked to Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure, why not?” Rio answered cooly, pulling her dress on. She wasn’t a big drinker, but she remembered that Jen said team bonding was just as important as the playing part. She expected a night of dancing and casual conversation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>What she didn’t expect was to face Agatha again so soon. She looked different. She looked good. The fabric hugged her hips and the neckline was suggestively low. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tried not to look, not to stare. She was here to play baseball. She wasn’t here for…well anything else, especially not this, not again, never again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But as Agatha moved across the dancefloor with a hopeless chump attempting to lead, Rio was helpless. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She watched the way the fabric spun out around her knees. She admired the grace with which she twirled to the music. She stared at…</span>
<em>
<span>no</span>
</em>
<span>. She stared down at the beer bottle in her hands instead, casually playing with the drops of condensation, trying anything to distract herself from the thoughts that she couldn’t want. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When the object of her fascination stormed over and yelled at her again, she should have shrunk away. She should have felt embarrassed. But she didn’t. She felt heat rising along the tight collar of her dress, and it wasn’t anger this time. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>“Jen…” Rio stood at the payphone near the practice field. She didn’t like using the phone at her host home due to the long distance charges. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio? What’s wrong? Did something happen?” Jen was worried. Rio was usually self-assured and confident in her words. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, nothing like that. I am in trouble though.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why? Did you hit someone? Rio, I told you to be careful with stuff like that. You could get suspended or worse...thrown out of the league. And then what? Do I need to come get you? Oh god, I’ll have to get on a train. If they even let me on. How am I going to get time off work? I can’t-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jen! Calm down, it’s not that. Jeez. It’s…well…we might have another…Rosie situation.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The line went silent and then Jen finally uttered out, “Who is it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you remember that picture from my locker? The beautiful batter?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, Rio, no! Is she on your team?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s on the Comets.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, so you won’t have to see her much. It won’t be a problem, right?” Jen had a tone of warning. “You know what will happen if you go down that road. I can protect you from a lot, but not everything, not that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio unlocked the box in her mind for just a second. The one that she kept on the highest shelf, hidden from view. The one she had to purposefully choose to ignore. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rosie Morales. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her best friend through high school. Until she wasn’t. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?” Jen asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry, I know. I know. I’ll try to keep my distance. I’ll be fine, I promise. She’s probably married anyway. She’s got a temper like your father.” Rio leaned against her forearm that draped across the phone booth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know you like them with some fire.” Jen snarked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m here for baseball.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You better be. If you find yourself slipping, call me immediately. I’ll talk you off the ledge.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks, Jen. I have to go but thank you. Talk soon.” Rio hung up after hearing the positive affirmation from her oldest friend. Jen always knew how to knock some sense into her. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>“She’s so good, Jen.” Rio was back at the payphone after her second game pitching. The stadium had cleared out, but she had to make this call. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You better mean good on the field.” Jen said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Obviously. You should see her arm. She threw me out trying to steal. I couldn’t believe it. The throw was literally inch perfect.” Rio tried and failed to hide her amazement. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And? These are professionals, not just the back-alley chumps you’re used to playing with.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s different. A different level than the rest. It’s like she’s constantly trying to get at me and throw me off, so I’m forced to give it right back.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tell me about anyone else on your team or any other team.” Jen tried to redirect her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, ummm. There’s Greta on my team. She’s got a mouth on her, curses like a sailor! But she can really hit, and she’s probably one of the best first sackers in the league. There’s Carson too. Those two are like peas in a pod. Carson’s our catcher…not as skilled as Agatha, mind you, but she’s a real leader for the team. Everyone follows her lead.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, follow them. You need to focus on something else, anything. I know how you get.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swallowed her protests. Jen was right. “We’re heading out on the road soon anyway. I probably won’t see her for weeks.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good. Get closer to your teammates. They are your family for the season. Keep your head in the game above all. Your uncle told me to tell you that everyone misses you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I miss them all. Tell them I’m okay and having the best time. I might not be able to call for a while. See ya!” Rio picked up her bag off the ground at her feet and strolled home alone. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>In the hotel in Racine, Rio was rooming with Carson. She liked her company and was incredibly impressed by her detailed note cards on their opponents. The catcher liked to write out tips for the pitchers on every single batter. She knew their strengths, their weaknesses, and which pitches worked best for all different scenarios. It was invaluable information.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The night after the first game against the Belles, Rio went out to dinner with Jess and the outfield girls. They were all craving burgers, so she tagged along. They invited her for drinks at a local bar, but she was feeling way too full and way too tired to join. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going to head back. Thanks anyway!” Rio waved them off. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She decided to take the stairs up to the third floor where her room was. She turned the key and opened the door in a quick, fluid motion. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio froze in the doorway. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Greta Gill was straddling Carson in one of the beds, both of them in their underclothes and engaging in what could only be described as intense necking. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hastily turned and shouted, “Sorry!” as she backed out of the room and shut the door. She stood in shock in the hallway for a minute as she heard her teammates fumbling around in the room and whispering at each other. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The door reopened and Greta popped out in a lopsided dress, the buttons not quite done up correctly. Her usually perfect hair was sticking out in the back like a tumbleweed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio…” She put a hand on Rio’s forearm. “You won’t…you won’t tell anyone will you?” Greta worried at her lip and looked up and down the hall. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I won’t, really. I won’t say anything.” Rio did her best to reassure her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Greta narrowed her eyes and assessed the pitcher. She seemed to trust her words, “I’ll see you at practice in the morning.” She practically ran off to her own room on the floor below. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated before opening the hotel room again, but finally walked in and saw Carson leaning back on the bed, staring up at the slow-moving, creaking fan.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The catcher sat up and scooted over to the edge, “Hey, sorry…I thought you were going to be out late.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I should have knocked.” Rio offered and shrugged her shoulders. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you gonna…you know?” Carson lifted her brows and winced.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Report us.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why would I do that?” Rio sat down on her bed opposite Carson. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Carson’s mouth turned down in a frown, “What do you want?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Huh? I don’t want anything.” Rio shook her head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, you saw us kissing. Two women. Most people would be aghast, offended, shocked. Are you going to hold this over us or something? Blackmail us to the coach?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pushed up against her own thighs and stood carefully. She walked back and forth in front of the beds. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why are you pacing?” Carson asked, watching the pitcher walk the same line over and over again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio battled internally with herself. She was here for baseball. She was here for baseball. But…she had never met anyone else. Anyone like her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She stopped. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I get it.” The words climbed out of her mouth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You get what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Being…” Rio nodded suggestively, hoping she wouldn’t be forced to say it but Carson was just looking at her with pure confusion. Rio groaned, “...queer.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The whites of Carson’s eyes appeared like headlights and a salacious smile cut across her face, “You?” She pointed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah.” Rio admitted for the first time in her life to Carson’s over-dramatic gasp. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>“The Comets are playing their last game against the Blue Sox. You two want to check it out?” Greta proposed after they finished their game. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They took Greta’s car for the short ride. Now that Rio was in on their secret, Carson and Greta were able to hold hands for the entire trip. It was tooth-achingly sweet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“When did you know, Rio?” Greta asked. “That you were…like us?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There wasn’t a singular moment. It didn’t flip on like a lightbulb. I think I’ve just always been like this. I lost my parents when I was really young, so my aunt and uncle raised me. They have seven boys, so I was always around them. Everyone would mistake me for a boy because I just wore their hand-me-downs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>I didn’t have many girl friends until high school besides my best friend, Jen. Boys used to try to kiss me or ask me on dates, but I wasn’t interested. Until this new girl walked into my English class. I damn near fainted when she walked in the door. I had never seen a more beautiful person in my entire life. All I wanted to do was spend time with her, impress her, and be around her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Awwww, baby’s first crush.” Greta teased. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Basically.” Rio smiled at the memory. “I didn’t know that at the time. Nothing would have ever happened if it had been left to me, but one day, after school, we were walking home together and she asked me if I ever kissed anyone. I said no, and she asked if I wanted to practice.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Clever girl.” Carson said. “What a classic move.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was putty in her hand, and she knew it. We started having kissing practice every moment that we could find alone. I had never felt anything like that before. God, my heart still races thinking about it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What happened? I’m guessing you guys didn’t live happily ever after?” Greta asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We were caught at school in the janitor’s closet by a teacher. We tried to deny it, but she had seen us. They called my aunt and her parents. And I never saw her again.” Rio looked out the window forlornly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you get in trouble with your family?” Carson turned around and looked at her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I lied. It was cowardly but…I was scared. I blamed her and said she forced me to. My aunt believed me, but I could tell she doubted it a little. She kept a real close eye on me after that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Carson nodded in understanding, “Where did the girl go?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No idea. She was pulled out of school immediately, and I was too scared to go near her house. I waited a few weeks and walked by it, but they had moved.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry, Rio. That’s tough. Have you been with anyone since?” Greta asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Women? No. I didn’t know if I could go through that again. That shame, that all-consuming shame. It’s soul crushing. I dated a few fellas from work, but well…you know how that is.” She laughed. It felt so freeing to be able to talk about this with other people that weren’t Jen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know it's not just us two, right? The league is swimming with other queers. Most keep it way underwraps, but if you’re in the know, you can find someone easier than you think.” Greta explained. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s mind swooped immediately to a certain catcher and Carson caught the pause, “Someone making you dizzy?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ummm…” Rio didn’t really want to reveal all her embarrassing secrets but at this point, what the hell? “The Comets. The catcher.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Angel?! You’re carrying a torch for Agatha Harkness??” Greta nearly swerved off the road, and they all grabbed for something to hold onto. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tried to readjust herself back in the seat, having flown across to the other side, “I’m not going to act on anything. I think she hates me anyway.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow, no. Sorry, I’m just shocked. Angel is notoriously spiky. She’s not very personable and can be hard to understand. A complicated past, I heard. Why her?” Greta asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why anybody? I don’t know. There’s something about her. She’s a puzzle I would love to solve.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re dreaming if you think you have a chance. I swear she’s as straight as the day is long.” Carson added. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So were you, darling.” Greta quipped and gently put an arm over her lover’s shoulders. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>“Want some, uh, some extra time with Angel?” Greta stumbled over the question. They were a few drinks in after the game finished. A few fans in the stands had kept the drinks flowing when they found out the three of them were also ballplayers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Careful, Greta. Maybe we should go back.” Carson suggested, wary of the look in Greta’s eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s propose a wager. You know they won’t be able to resist. We could get some cash for a little getaway, toots.” She winked and saw Carson relent. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Greta saw Agatha and other Comets players leaving the ballpark, “Hey Butterfingers! Nice hitting tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s mind was dragging along one or three or five too many beers. Suddenly, she was sitting in the outfield and finishing off another drink. Someone asked why she was there and she somehow managed to piece together a coherent response of “The only way to get better is to play against the best.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>The next moments came in broken flashes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jumping the fence onto the dark, empty field. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Taking the mound, barely able to even see the catcher’s mitt. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Pitching to two batters like it was nothing. The repetition in her bones.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Seeing Agatha come up to the plate, looking as fiercely determined as ever. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hearing the loud crack of the bat as she hit a no-doubt homer. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Feeling Anger tap at her back and take control of the wheel. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Saying something awful to Agatha and watching her face break at Rio’s terrible insults. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The pain of a slap across her face. Tackling, pushing, shoving, limbs flying. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then the agony in her hand as she connected with the beautiful face that haunted her dreams. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Shame, embarrassment, disappointment, running, car ride, ice on her hand, falling asleep. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>“I think you may have fucked that up.” Greta said over breakfast the next morning. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ya think?” Rio deadpanned back. She was struggling to even grip her fork to pick up the scrambled eggs on her plate. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What possessed you? Why’d you serve up that knuckle sandwich?” Greta asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tried to call back the memories, but it was like her mind was blanketed in fog. It was such a blur. “I didn’t mean to hit her. I was trying to get that other gal who slapped me. It was an accident.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re going to drive over and give them their winnings in a few hours. Do you want to come? You could apologize in person.” Carson said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t think I can look her in the eyes. I’m mortified.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Suit yourself. Well, we’re playing them again in a few weeks, so you’re going to have to face her again whether you like it or not.” Carson wiped her mouth with the thick hotel napkin and pushed back to stand. Greta finished off her toast and left Rio alone at the table. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They wouldn’t be playing the Comets in a few weeks. They wouldn’t play the Comets again. The next day back in Springfield, the coach gathered the team at the field in the morning and made the announcement. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The league is closing us down. The Sallies and the Colleens are done. They are exploring options to send us on the road together as a barnstorming duo, but nothing is determined yet. I’m so sorry, girls. Don’t make any arrangements yet. The top brass said they would let me know the next steps in a few days.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But Coach…what are we meant to do?” Greta stepped forward and asked what was on all their minds. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We wait. Season’s almost over anyway so not much we can do. I’m sorry.” He frowned and tossed his hands up in defeat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We can’t fight this? What if we fundraised or-” Greta tried again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Decision is final. The teams are hemorrhaging money and not earning it back. I’ll send word when I have news.” He grimaced and walked off the field without fanfare. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck!” Greta shouted and kicked the dirt in frustration. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is bullshit.” Jess shook her head and chewed on a toothpick furiously. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was just getting started…” Rio lamented. </span>
</p><p>
<span>To her surprise, it wasn’t the coach who called a few days later. Their chaperone, Norma, gave her a ring in the morning. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just spoke with management, Rio. A team has made an offer to buy out your contract. They want you for the remainder of the season.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow, that’s incredible. What team?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Comets.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart sank. Agatha’s team. Why’d it have to be her team? “Is that the only offer?” She asked carefully. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is that not good enough?” Norma snapped back, “No other girl on the team has gotten an offer.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry, I was just curious. I’ll take it. Of course, I’ll take it. Thank you, Norma.” Rio would be crazy to pass up the chance to join a strong team like the Comets. Personal issues aside, they were in serious playoff contention, and many were tipping them to win the whole shebang. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought so. Give me a week or so to sort out the paperwork and finalize the transfer. You’ll be on the next bus to Kenosha in no time.” </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>When she walked onto the Comets field for the first time, Agatha looked at her like she had seen a ghost.. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She expected a frosty reception but imaging it and experiencing it were very different. Throughout the practice, she caught Agatha’s glares and stares. It was like she was trying to wish her away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She watched the catcher follow the coach off the field and could only assume what she was going to say. Rio was meant to meet with Coach Grant to discuss the upcoming games, so she trailed after them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Bits and pieces of the argument filtered through the door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“...too green…she’s dangerous…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, clear as day, “How am I going to play with her?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was leaning against the wall when Agatha was suddenly standing in front of her. Irritation was clear on her face. Her eyes were the most beautiful blue color. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When the catcher said “eat my ass”, Rio almost collapsed in a belly laugh. It was so unexpected, so raw. The visuals that shot into her brain would give a nun a heart attack. She grappled with her rising pulse. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Talk of killing each other shouldn’t have made her palms sweat, but that was a peculiarity to examine another day. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha called her “superstar”, and she felt like she won something. </span>

<p>
<span>“You know, the league years were a tough time, but they were a great time. You’d have lonely hours on the road in hotels or at home in your room all alone, and then you’d have fantastic times with the games and the other girls and the fans and the outings.” Marge Cryan</span>
</p>
</blockquote><p>
<span>July set and August rose, announcing itself with early mornings and warm, humid nights. Baseball was a constant throughout, and the Comets were racing to the finish line in spectacular form. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They swept the series against Racine and had an uncharacteristic three day break before the next run of games against the Rockford Peaches on the road. The team was currently standing at 56 wins, 28 losses. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They were first in the league. The Blue Sox were nipping at their heels though, so they needed to stay strong for the rest of the month. The playoffs started at the beginning of September.</span>
</p><p>
<span>With an extra long weekend on the horizon, Horsey had a proposition to the team after their last win against the Belles, “My parents said I could invite everyone to their lake house. It’s a great spot on Fox Lake, about 45 minutes away. We’ve got canoes, a fire pit, and the swimming is swell.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No kidding! Count me in!” Peggy jumped at the chance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can the twins come too?” Wanda asked, and Horsey nodded enthusiastically. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure, there are four bedrooms, plus an entire finished basement and plenty of space for everyone.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I could use a vacation.” Agatha said, joining the chorus of affirmations from the entire team. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve never been to a lake house before.” Rio said excitedly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Just four players couldn’t make it. Shirley was afraid of water and warned them all about flesh-eating bacteria, Fossey wasn’t feeling very well and didn’t want to put a damper on the fun, Sugar’s boyfriend was in town, and Betty still lived at home and didn’t think her parents would approve. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, there’s plenty of parking. Tell me if you’re driving, and I’ll write down the address. Bring a sleeping bag, swim clothes, and a good attitude. There’s a grocer in town, so we can get any food there. I’m so excited!” Horsey clapped her hands. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey Dottie, can Peggy and I ride with you tomorrow?” Agatha asked before anyone else had the chance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure, Angel. Helen’s coming as well. I can probably fit one more.” Dottie said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Buckets put her hand up immediately to take the last spot. The other gals sorted out the car arrangements, and they were all set. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The next morning, Agatha and Peggy quickly scarfed down the generous plates of waffles. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks for letting us borrow your sleeping bags. We’ll bring them back safely.” Agatha said to their hosts. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You better. Those were expensive!” Pearl admonished. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Be careful in the water, girls. You don’t want to get hurt right before the playoffs begin.” Gertie warned them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ll be good, mums.” Peggy smirked and downed the last of her orange juice as they heard the loud beep from Dottie’s car out the front. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha jumped up and thanked them for the meal before throwing her duffel bag over her shoulder, “See you on Monday!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>They scooted into the backseat together with Buckets. It was a tight squeeze but not uncomfortable. It was not a long drive. They distracted each other with chat about the upcoming games. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s the verdict? How many do we have to win to top the league?” Helen asked the car. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We have to win at least half of the remaining 20 games, and the Blue Sox have to </span>
<em>
<span>not </span>
</em>
<span>win every single one. If they go on a crazy streak, they will snatch the top spot.” Agatha had written down all sorts of variations in her journal. The most likely scenario was the Comets won, but there were several edge cases where that didn’t happen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They could somehow lose all the upcoming games and drop to third or fourth. The Peaches and Blue Sox could both go on streaks and push the Comets down the table. Baseball was as unpredictable as a bucking bronco sometimes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have a feeling we’re gonna win.” Dottie declared. She had been on the team for three years and had yet to advance past the first round of the playoffs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“With Rio on the team, I think we could do anything.” Helen added.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Amen! As long as our bats are hot, we’re going to be unstoppable.” Dottie said and the rest agreed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared out at the passing landscape and daydreamed of all that was to come. They were good now, but the pressure of the playoffs was a whole different story. She had seen amazing teams crumble as if they were made of sand. She had watched scrappy, low ranking teams turn to diamonds and upset everyone. She had been around long enough to temper her expectations. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s just get through August. One game at a time.” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy booed her to the laughter of the rest of the gals. “Don’t bring us down, Angel. Have a little faith!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dottie pulled down the long driveway to Horsey’s family lake house. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Golly, what a place!” Helen exclaimed as they took in the large cabin overlooking the water. It wasn’t flashy or sprawling, but it was impressive nonetheless. Based on the number of cars there, everyone else had already arrived. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha walked in first and immediately saw Billy and Tommy chasing each other in circles around the living room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Welcome! Glad you made it okay, you better grab a bed while you can!” Horsey called out and pointed down the hallway. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t need to be told twice. She immediately rushed and looked into every room. The first door she opened was obviously the twins’ as the middle of the floor was littered with a pile of toy planes and cars. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Nope, definitely not.</span>
</em>
<span> She closed the door immediately. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The next room was two sets of bunk beds. </span>
<em>
<span>No way. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Directly across from that was a small pink room. There was only one single twin bed that Buckets was sitting on. “There’s room on the floor for a sleeping bag.” She offered but Agatha had already shut the door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Running out of options, she approached the last door at the end of the hall. It was the biggest room by far but only had a large king bed. Lupe was opening her bag near the dresser. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve already called this one with Horsey. Sorry!” She shrugged. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha walked back out and saw the other girls picking from the choices she turned down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey Horsey, where else can I sleep?” She asked the hostess. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think Rio has set up shop in the basement. You can join her down there. The couches are comfier than they look.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grimaced and faked a smile. </span>
<em>
<span>Of course it had to be Rio.</span>
</em>
<span> There were eleven other teammates here and somehow, some twisted universal force was determined to make her suffer. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She walked down the wooden stairs off the kitchen into the basement. It was less a basement and more just a lower floor of the house. The room was wide open, wood-panelled like the rest of the place, and carpeted. There was a row of bookshelves covering the wall next to an old fireplace, and three floral sofas arranged in a u-shape in the center. Various other armchairs were arranged around the space, along with stacks of board games and piles of sporting equipment. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The hero of the room were huge picture windows across an entire wall facing the lake. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sucked in a breath, “Whoa.” She whispered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s something, right?” A voice said, emerging from behind a sliding pocket door that looked to be a spare bathroom. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had wondered where Rio was, “Yeah, what a view. Don't know why everyone else chose those rooms upstairs.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Probably not used to slumming it on a couch or the floor.” Rio said, moving to sit on one of the sofas. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha placed her bag under the window and stared out at the water. The lake was right in their backyard. She could see a long pier and other people already out in boats or swimming along the shore. “And you’re used to ‘slumming’ it?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I grew up in a house with three bedrooms and ten people. So, you could say that, yeah.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How did you all fit? Agatha turned and sat on the other sofa to Rio’s left. She sunk deep into the cushions and tried to adjust herself. They both held in their laughter as she awkwardly maneuvered herself into a normal sitting position, fighting the flowery design that seemed intent on sucking her in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You good?” Rio asked and Agatha shot her a thumbs up. “I shared with my three youngest cousins, and then as the oldest moved out, we’d shuffle. I usually just spent the summers sleeping on the screened-in back porch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You slept outside?” Agatha was born and raised in the north east. She could only imagine freezing to death in the backyard. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have you been to Florida? The humidity is punishing. At least outside, you can pretend you feel a breeze or pray for the afternoon storms to cool you down.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We had spring training in Cuba last year. It wasn’t brutally hot, but I don’t know how you could live in that humidity. It was suffocating!” Agatha held her throat, pretending to choke. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Cuba? No kidding. I’ve always wanted to go - how’d the league get permission for that?” Rio asked curiously. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“They have their own women’s league, so we played them in a few friendly matches. The Brooklyn Dodgers were touring the island at the same time, so the league tagged along. I think our games drew a bigger crowd. Those Cubans love baseball!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>They heard shoes clomping down the steps then Dottie appeared, “We’re setting up the volleyball net, do y’all want to join?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>They looked at each other and pushed up off the couches. There was a sliding door that led right into the backyard. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy was stringing up the net, while Lupe and Flo were hitting the volleyball back and forth. Wanda was slathering sunscreen on a whining Billy, and Helen was cracking open a Coke. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ve got two more takers!” Dottie ran over to help Peggy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Horsey walked over, “Schoolyard pick, line up. I’ll be one captain, Wanda you’re the other.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They got into a line facing the two appointed captains. Wanda flipped a nickel and earned first choice. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha.” She chose to nobody’s surprise. The catcher swaggered over and waved at the poor unchosen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine, Rio.” Horsey didn’t want those two on the same team. Rio joined her side. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dottie.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Peggy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lupe.” Wanda pointed to the pitcher. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on over, Flo.” Horsey called to the last girl standing. They had their teams, four on four. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Losers cook dinner.” Wanda suggested. The other teammates were currently out getting groceries for the weekend. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re on. Let’s play first to 11 wins.” Horsey agreed and laid the ground rules. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy took the first serve and shot it over the net. Agatha got the first bump, Lupe bumped it again back over. Flo passed it up in the air, Horsey set it, and Rio ran up and delivered a cracking spike. First point. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you a secret pro volleyball player too?” Agatha jeered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I like all sports. Not my fault, I tend to be good at most of them.” Rio responded as her teammates all came over to give her high-fives. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Horsey’s team went ahead quickly 5-1, as Rio continued to wallop her impressive spikes on the unprepared defense. Agatha was able to block a few, but it was no use. Wanda was able to put a few more points on their tally, but they were outmatched. </span>
</p><p>
<span>On the matchpoint, Agatha served. She watched as the ball bounced between Peggy then Flo. She saw Rio sizing up the ball, tracking it through the air, her eyes locked on their target. The pitcher took a few steps forward and launched into the air, her arm rising above her head and connecting with the ball perfectly. It fired down and hit the ground despite Agatha’s attempt at it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Game over. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What a game, Rio! If you ever leave baseball, you should see if any volleyball teams will take you.” Dottie patted her on the back and grabbed a soda from the cooler. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>Wanda took the lead on cooking. She was easily the most competent cook in the house, although they were just having a weenie roast. She made her mom’s Sokovian potato salad, a delicious, Eastern European-inspired side dish. Lupe manned the post at the grill and casually turned the ears of corn and hot dogs over the coals. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha avoided all responsibility and sat down on one of the lawn chairs around the fire pit. The sun was very slowly setting, and Horsey was attempting to start the fire. Rio and Buckets were kicking around a soccer ball with the twins.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is quite a place, Horsey. You’re lucky to have a spot like this in your family.” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks, Angel. It’s pretty great, huh? Your family doesn’t have a vacation spot?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a sharp laugh, “I never left my state until I went to Chicago for try-outs. My mom wasn’t into traveling, vacationing, or the concept of fun.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda came down from the kitchen, arms full of food. She dumped it onto the serving table with the rest of the dishes and drinks. “Food’s ready, come and get it!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grabbed a paper plate and loaded it up with everything in sight - a scoop of potato salad, a scoop of coleslaw, a bread roll, corn on the cob, a slice of watermelon, and two hot dogs. She poured a glass of lemonade and carefully sat back near the fire. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The twins carried their plates and sat in the grass behind the firepit. Wanda brought over a blanket and joined them on the ground. Peggy sat beside them, and Rio took up the spot next to Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks for this amazing meal, Wanda.” She turned around and gave her compliments to the chef. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re welcome, Rio. It was no trouble. I love cooking.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why?” Agatha groaned. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Some of us can’t go out to eat for every meal or have host families that cook for us daily.” Wanda said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What can I say? I’m blessed in many ways.” Agatha lifted her corn cob and munched away at the kernels. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Auntie Aggie, watch me.” Billy waited for her to turn and watch as he copied her and devoured his corn cob like a beaver going after a log. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nice work, kiddo. Don’t choke.” She said back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, Rio…we don’t know much about you. Do you got a fella back home?” Dottie looked over the pitcher. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio finished swallowing a bite of hot dog and took a drink of her Coke, “Nope. No boyfriend for me. I’ve actually never dated any fella.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gasped along with several of the others, “Never?!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked over at her, “Is that so surprising?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s just…you’re so…I mean, surely you had guys asking you out at school?” She struggled to articulate her point. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure, plenty asked, but you know that you can say no, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So you’ve never even kissed anyone?” Peggy asked like it was the most outrageous thought. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I never said that.” Rio grinned like a Cheshire cat to the “oohs” and “ahhs” of the group. She locked eyes with Agatha, and the catcher felt a sudden heat spark between them. Agatha averted her eyes, feeling suddenly embarrassed like she was caught doing something she shouldn’t. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, let’s go around and say the worst kiss you’ve ever had.” Peggy clapped her hands and rubbed them together slyly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll go!” Helen pulled her chair over from the picnic table. “A few years ago, I went on a first date with the gym teacher. He took me to the cinema, which was fine, and then drove me home. He was so nervous, it was almost endearing, but then he went in for a kiss, and I could see the sweat dripping across his upper lip. I couldn’t do it. I ran from that car and had to avoid him for the rest of the school year.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Everyone cracked up around the circle. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I got one.” Dottie volunteered. “I was in my last year of high school. This boy, Richie, asked me to the dance. He was a tall drink of iced tea if I ever saw one, so of course, I said yes. Richie was a real jive bomber on the dance floor and could move his hips. We were the center of attention that night. A slow number came on, and he started pulling me close. My arms were around his neck, his hands were on my waist. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He was looking at my lips. He leaned in, and I swear he opened his mouth as big as a bullfrog. He was fixin’ to swallow me, and his lips completely covered mine in a wet, sloppy mess. It was awful. I pushed him away after a few seconds of painful endurance and said I had to powder my nose. I made sure to get off the dance floor any time another slow song was played!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“God, I hate when they open their mouths like that! It’s disgusting. I don’t want to see what you had for breakfast!” Peggy added. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who told them that we like that? Did we miss some telegram or something?” Helen asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about when they use their tongue like a weapon?” Lupe began fake gagging at the thought. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy jumped in next, “My worst kiss is easy. Well, my worst almost-kiss. It was the off season, and I’d just finished my first year with the league. I went back to Salem with Agatha, and we went out on the town in Boston and a group of G.I.s were at this bar. One soldier with platinum blonde hair buys me a drink. He starts talking about how he’s shipping out soon, how he wishes he could spend one more night with a lady before he goes, blah blah blah. I’d heard it all before, and he’d had more than a few drinks; he was getting proper pissed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>I let him buy me a few more and chat me up. He was handsome, but he pulled me out to the alleyway and pinned me up against the wall. It was not entirely unpleasant, but then as he went in for the kiss, I closed my eyes, and then felt something warm dripping down my back as I heard him retch over my shoulder. He vomited all over the wall behind me. I couldn’t even speak. I just left him there and went to get Agatha and go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, the smell in the taxi home. I can still remember it viscerally.” Agatha groaned. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Y’all really know how to turn a girl’s stomach. I’m going to head to bed!” Dottie stood up, along with a few others who grabbed their plates and went up to the house. Now that the sun was gone, it was a whole different kind of dark. Given the isolation of the place, it was tough to see right in front of you. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha helped Wanda carry the rest of the dishes up to the kitchen, and Rio helped Horsey put out the fire and clean the grill. Wanda went to put the boys to bed as they were already up way past their usual bedtime, and when Agatha finished washing up, she took the stairs down to the lower floor. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio still wasn’t back yet, so she decided to take a shower in the bathroom and get changed into her pajamas, a sleeveless polka-dot top with matching wide-leg bottoms. She unrolled her sleeping bag onto the firmest of the three couches and grabbed two of the pillows. Then, she pulled the heavy curtains across the row of windows, leaving just a small opening to let in the sun in the morning. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She scanned the books on the many shelves and tried to find anything decent to read, but it seemed like everything was an old mystery or a penny drama. As she was about to give up hope, Rio slid open the glass door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey.” She said as she made her way over to her bag. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hi.” Agatha said back. “The shower pressure’s not great, but it gets pretty warm if you like a hot shower.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah, I prefer a morning shower, thanks.” Rio started taking her button-up top off casually, and Agatha had to turn away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She had seen the entire team change before and after games hundreds of times, but this felt different. This felt strangely intimate, now that they were alone in this foreign space. She tried not to look as Rio slipped off her skirt and was left standing in just her bra and briefs. She stared at the book titles like they were the most interesting things she had ever seen in the world. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She grabbed a random Julie Campbell crime novel that looked readable. When she turned, Rio was removing her bra, and Agatha felt her heart pounding. She dropped the book on the floor like a clutz causing Rio to turn, and </span>
<em>
<span>oh my dear god…</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“You alright there…butterfingers?” Rio teased. Agatha’s face felt like she had received a nasty sunburn. It was such an intense, sudden warmth as she bent to pick up the fallen book and came up to see the full sight of Rio’s bare chest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m yeah, I’m great, I’m fine. Sorry, I…didn’t mean to ummm…drop it.” The words came through as if slowed by tar. Agatha was many things, but she would never consider herself nervous or tongue-tied. But in this second, she couldn’t think. She couldn’t remember what she had been doing. All she could see was a wondrous display of skin. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had on her mischievous grin again like she was in on something that Agatha wasn’t. She nodded and grabbed her pajama top. Agatha tried to get her breathing under control; it felt like a manual process all of a sudden. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Am I making you nervous?” Rio asked as she slowly buttoned up the collared striped top. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What? No! No way. Nothing I haven’t seen before.” Agatha tried to play it off, trying to seem way cooler than she felt. She played with her hair absentmindedly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stepped into the other half of her sleepwear set, a mid-thigh length pair of shorts. “I don’t want to make you uncomfortable.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shuffled over to her sleeping spot of the night and jumped into the sack. She zipped up the side half-way as it was fairly warm even at this late hour. “Don’t flatter yourself, hun.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She pretended to open the book and read the first sentence over and over again. Not a single word could absorb as her brain was currently replaying the last few minutes on repeat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn’t answer the question at the firepit.” Rio rolled out her sleeping bag on the couch opposite her. “Do you have a worst kiss story?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clapped the book shut, obviously no reading was about to get done. She stared up at the ceiling. “Nothing funny or interesting. My ex wasn’t much of a kisser.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“When did you divorce?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took in a big breath and released it. She didn’t love discussing her past, if she could help it, but she looked over and saw Rio laying sideways, staring at her with genuine interest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We were never going to last. It was going downhill from the start. I shouldn’t have ever married him, but I didn’t know there were any other options. Where I’m from, you finish school and you get married. In that order. I graduated and the first thing my mother asked was ‘when are you marrying Ralph?’ I hadn’t had a chance to think about what to do next, so I took the path of least resistance.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you like him at all?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure, he was kind and simple. We started dating my senior year and then got married the next summer. I was 19 and clueless. The Depression had started. Ralph couldn’t get a job to save his life. We had to borrow money from my mother just to afford groceries and firewood. It was awful. I was able to get a part-time gig at the canning factory, but it was hard. He got a job on a fishing boat, so I spent a lot of time alone. That’s how I got started with softball. I joined the church’s softball team just to pass the time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha thought back to those years of solitude. Ralph would be gone before sunrise and wouldn’t get back until she was asleep. She was only able to stay sane thanks to Peggy’s companionship and the softball team. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not much of a relationship then.” Rio commented. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, we thought a kid would save it. A baby would give me something to do, something to occupy my time. We tried and tried. I thought something was wrong with me because nothing worked. Every month was a disappointment. My mother said I was cursed…that I wasn’t meant to carry a child.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why would she say that to you?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s a cold-hearted bitch.” Agatha said plainly and shrugged with a smile. Rio tried and failed to hold in a laugh. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you…uh, did you have a child?” Rio asked cautiously. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicholas.” Agatha’s face lit up at his name, like someone had shined a light on her. “I was 25 and had given up hope, but he was my miracle. It was like I had made him from scratch. He didn’t look at all like Ralph or act like him. He was the sweetest baby, hardly cried, a great sleeper when I held him. Watching him grow each day was the greatest gift.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She went silent as she got lost in the memory of motherhood. A time in her life she often kept hidden away. Rio let her wander her thoughts in silence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha spoke again, “I know what you’re probably thinking. Where is my son now? He’s obviously not here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I wasn’t…you don’t have to say more, if you don’t want to.” Rio said. She could see the hurt fighting its way out through Agatha’s body language. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He died. He had just turned five. Doctor said it was pneumonia. There was that influenza epidemic that swept the nation that year, and so many people were sick in town. I tried to keep him home, but he got sick so quickly. One day we went to sleep, and the next day he didn’t wake up. Ralph was away. Peggy was there. I held his hand for the last time, and when I let it go, I became a ghost.” Agatha brushed the tears away with her arm and sniffed up her running nose. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio jumped up and grabbed a box of tissues that were on one of the bookshelves. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks, sorry. You probably don’t want to hear about a dead kid. It’s not something people generally want to talk about.” Agatha apologized and sat up to blow her nose. Rio sat back down on her couch. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He was your son. He was a part of your life. I’m interested in every part of you.” Rio said softly and looked over at her teammate with a tenderness that Agatha wasn’t used to. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ralph was called to serve not long after, and it was the perfect excuse to leave. We agreed to end it there. There was no coming back from that. He left for the army, and then I got the invite to try out for the league. It snapped me back to life, pulled my soul back into my body. It saved me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is that way you play so hard? Like you’ve got nothing to lose?” Rio asked, leaning forward.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, “I am also deeply competitive. Enough about me, please. What about you?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about me?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have you really never dated anyone?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I said I never dated a </span>
<em>
<span>fella</span>
</em>
<span>.” Rio said with an extra emphasis on the final word. Agatha looked at her curiously, her mind ticking. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She watched the pitcher’s tongue trace a trail along her inner cheek. A pause stretched before Agatha finally relented, “So…you dated…who?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let the silence grow before giving in, “Come on, you’re smart. Who else is there?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes narrowed. </span>
<em>
<span>What was she getting at? She hasn’t dated men, okay…so that leaves… “</span>
</em>
<span>Women?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes widened and her eyebrows raised. She cocked her head to the side as if to say </span>
<em>
<span>very good</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Really?” Agatha was whispering now. She looked up towards the stairs to see if anyone was coming. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is that a problem?” Rio leaned back on the cushions. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had been in the league long enough to know that there were some gals who preferred the company of each other over men. Everything was behind closed doors. She couldn’t say for sure, but people talked. Girls were there one day and gone the next. No public explanation, but the team usually could guess. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She thought about Jo DeLuca on the Peaches who was transferred out of nowhere that first season. Word was she was caught in a raid and beaten by the cops, but nobody could confirm it. Then there was Big Bessie from the Belles, a home run leader, but apparently got spotted in a cinema kissing a broad and before she could argue, she was sent on the next train home. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t have any problems with…people like you.” Agatha said. She had never met any that she knew of, but she didn’t see it as a sin or anything. Her mother had very strong feelings on the subject, and that was reason enough to be on the opposite side. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“People like me? We’re not a different species, you know.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry, I didn’t mean that. I just meant…” Agatha shook her head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Queer? It won’t infect you to say it.” Rio said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha levelled a harsh gaze across the space between them, “I know that. I’m sorry. I think I’m just tired. I might try to sleep, if that’s alright.” She laid back down in her sleeping bag. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood and flicked the lightswitch off before jumping onto her own couch and settling down. “Yeah, I’m pretty beat too.” There was a moment of silence as both women attempted to fall asleep despite their own racing thoughts. “Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?” She cracked an eye open and saw the pitcher staring over at her, lit only by the pale moonlight coming through the gap in the curtains. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can this stay between us? I don’t really want everyone to know my business.” Her voice was uncharacteristically hushed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not a motormouth. Whatever you say to me stays with me.” Agatha only really chatted with Wanda and Peggy. She avoided the petty gossip that flowed amongst the others. She also knew what this type of information could do to a gal. If the wrong person found out, Rio would be kicked out of the league…or worse. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks. That means more than you know.” Rio said and turned over, her back to Agatha as they both drifted off to sleep. </span>

      Chapter 12: Warming up
  </h2>

<blockquote>
<p>
<span>Every season, from spring training in April until September, the women of the All-American Girls Baseball League played eight games per week—six nights and Sunday doubleheaders. Only the weather would grant the occasional day off. “Believe me, we prayed for rain,” remembered pitcher Dorothy “Dottie” Wiltse.</span>
</p>
</blockquote><p>The next morning, Agatha and Rio were startled awake by the twins stomping down the stairs screaming “Breakfast is ready!!” at the top of their lungs. </p><p>“Remind me never to have children.” Rio groaned and put a throw pillow over her head. </p><p>Agatha waved them over and whispered to the two boys, who giggled at whatever she was saying. She pointed over to her irritated teammate on the other couch. </p><p>Suddenly, they were both tackling the pitcher, who was caught off guard and faked a good scream. She gently pushed them off, and they ran as fast as they could as she chased them up the stairs. </p><p>“I’ll get you back for that.” Rio said to Agatha, who was enjoying the show. </p><p>They both trudged upstairs in their pajamas and sat at the fully set dining table. Wanda had outdone herself again and whipped up stacks and stacks of pancakes for the house. </p><p>“Do you want to adopt a 24 year old? I’ve always wanted a mom that could cook like this.” Dottie slathered a knob of butter on her fourth pancake. </p><p>“I think two is more than enough.” Wanda laughed. The twins had already finished their breakfast and were racing each other up and down the hallway. </p><p>“What’s on the agenda today, Horsey?” Peggy asked. </p><p>“Well, we have two canoes if anyone wants to go out on the lake. Otherwise, we can swim around the dock. Looks like the perfect day for a dip!” She looked towards the window overlooking the water. </p><p>“Agatha and I will take one of the canoes!” Rio raised her hand and volunteered them both. </p><p>“What?!” Agatha looked across the table, shocked at the audacity. </p><p>“Come on, it’ll be fun.” Rio smiled back, but there was something sinister behind her eyes. </p><p>“Can Lupe and I take the other?” Flo asked. “I’ve always wanted to go out on a lake.”</p><p>“Yeah, of course. Just make sure you all wear life jackets before you go out. I don’t care how good a swimmer you say you are. It’s the rules.” Horsey cautioned them. </p><p>Agatha finished eating first and went downstairs quickly to get changed into her swimwear. She wasn’t shy about her body, but the idea of changing in front of Rio made her nervous. The thought of Rio’s bare chest flashed into her mind, and she felt her throat go dry. She pushed it away as she stepped into her one-piece suit, a bright blue swing dress style with thin straps and a flared skirt.</p><p>As she was pulling the last strap into place, Rio appeared behind her. </p><p>“Nice suit. That color makes your eyes really pop.” She remarked casually, not entirely unaware of how flustered that compliment made Agatha. </p><p>“Oh, really? Thanks.” Agatha grabbed a pair of white sunglasses from her bag to finish off the look and slipped into a pair of sandals. </p><p>Rio pulled out her swimsuit and immediately started stripping down, “Have you ever tried a two-piece? It’s very freeing.”</p><p>Agatha pushed the sunglasses up into her hair and watched Rio slip on the swim top, which resembled a bra. It was white with a bold red and green flower pattern. “No, I’ve never worn one before. I don’t know if I could pull it off.” </p><p>Rio scoffed at even the insinuation, “I’m sure you don’t believe that. Could you tie me up?” She gracefully pulled her hair aside, and Agatha tied the loose straps behind her neck in a bow. </p><p>“Thanks.” Rio said before turning around and dropping her shorts and underwear in a one quick motion. Agatha spun the other way but had already seen the smooth, toned skin on display - the muscles in her calves, the firmness of her thighs, the sensual curves of her behind. </p><p>
<em> Oh no. Am I going to become…no, I like men. Right? I was married to one. But did I even like that? Did I just marry him because that’s what I thought everyone did? Maybe it’s just been so long since I’ve been with anyone. Yeah, that’s it. That has to be it. I’m fantasizing about her because I’m lonely. I really need to get out there more. Maybe I should let Peggy take me out again. I just need to get laid. Badly.  </em>
</p><p>“Agatha? Did you hear me?” </p><p>“Sorry?” She hadn’t even heard Rio speak. She was so lost in her racing thoughts. Rio was now dressed in the matching bottom, it had the same pattern on the front and back and dark contrasting black panels on the sides. </p><p>“Can you pass me my towel? It’s there.” She pointed to the beach towel draped across the top of the bookshelf in front of Agatha. </p><p>“Oh, here you go. You ready?” Agatha threw the towel over and walked over to the sliding glass that led outside. </p><p>Horsey helped them push the two-seater canoe into the water, and Agatha sat up front. The water was sparkling and clear as they shoved off and started paddling towards the middle. They could see other groups around the shore playing games or getting their own boats out. </p><p>Agatha moved her shoulders to readjust her lifevest that was starting to cut into her neck and kept paddling at a steady pace. She had never been out on a lake like this and loved the feeling of serenity on the water. </p><p>“Are you a good swimmer?” Rio’s voice interrupted her meditative state. </p><p>She turned around and saw Rio had stopped paddling. Her paddle was resting across her thighs and she was smiling at Agatha in a way that made her nervous. </p><p>“I can keep myself afloat…why?” She replied. </p><p>Rio’s smile spread wide as she started rocking slowly side to side, causing the canoe to dangerously move on the water. </p><p>“Rio, what are you doing?” Agatha put her paddle down and grabbed the edges of the boat to try to steady it. “Don’t do this.”</p><p>“I told you I owed you one for this morning.” Rio added more weight behind her movements as she tilted to and fro in her seat. Agatha was debating whether to turn and grab her but worried that any sudden moves would cause the whole thing to flip. </p><p>Instead, she turned in her seat to face Rio, “We’ll both get soaked. Come on, let’s just keep paddling.”</p><p>“I don’t mind getting a little wet.” Rio said and with an overexaggerated wink, she threw her body sideways and flipped the canoe. </p><p>“AGHHH!!!” Agatha yelped as the cold water hit her skin, and she was completely submerged with the canoe upside down next to her. “What the hell?!” </p><p>Rio was laughing as her head popped up from the water. She laid on her back in the water and floated as if she didn’t have a care in the world. Agatha splashed her face as payback and relished in look of annoyance that Rio shot her way. </p><p>“Help me flip this thing.” She directed and Rio came over to help her push the canoe over. It was much harder than it looked, but they eventually got it rightside up again. Rio swam to fetch the two paddles that had floated astray. </p><p>“Are you happy now?” Agatha asked her when she climbed back in the boat. Both of them were slightly out of breath, completely drenched and dripping, their hairdos ruined. She tried (and failed) to not look at the way Rio’s bathing suit stuck to her skin or the way the water dripped down her muscular arms. </p><p>Rio ran her hands through her hair and slicked it back. She took in the appearance of her teammate and bit her lip to keep from laughing out loud. “Oh yeah, we’re even now.” </p><p>Agatha had to admire her gumption. The more she got to know Rio, the more intriguing she found her. On the field, she was all confidence and swagger. In person, she was surprisingly tender but also wielded a cutting, dry sense of humor. She was infuriating and fascinating. She was annoying, yet Agatha was undeniably charmed. </p><p>When they arrived back at the shore, Peggy met them to catch the boat. “Whoa, what happened to you two?”</p><p>“Ask her.” Agatha jumped out and pointed to Rio who put her hands up in surrender. </p><p>“These boats are more unstable than you expect.” Rio said and avoided the daggers that Agatha was shooting her way. </p><p>After cleaning up and changing, Agatha joined Peggy on the deck for a smoke. They sat on the low chairs that overlooked the yard below and the lake.  </p><p>“What’s getting your goat?” Peggy looked up at her old friend, who was clearly seething about something. She passed over her silver cigarette case and signature lighter. </p><p>Agatha took a long drag. She didn’t smoke often but enjoyed one every now and then on a night out or day off. “I’m not mad. I’m just…do you ever feel completely disoriented? Like everything you once thought is now wrong?”</p><p>Peggy tapped out some ash, “What’s the context here?”</p><p>“It’s been over five years since Ralph. And I haven’t…you know, been with anyone since.”</p><p>“Yeah, I’m well aware. I’ve tried to set you up with so many men over the past few years. I gave up because you kept turning them down, remember?”</p><p>“Do you think something is wrong with me?” Agatha dropped her guard for once and asked the question honestly. She turned her head to look at Peggy. </p><p>“What? Don’t be a daft cow. You’re a catch, literally…you are a catcher.” Peggy cracked up at her own play on words. Agatha stared blankly, unimpressed. “Sorry, but seriously, why do you ask?”</p><p>Agatha watched the gals swimming and jumping off the dock. She saw Lupe sitting atop Dottie’s shoulders battling Helen and Wanda in a game of chicken in the shallow water. Billy and Tommy were kicking a beach ball along the shore. Rio was laying on her towel next to Flo, sunbathing. </p><p>“It seems like everyone else can just fall in love. Just give themselves away to someone else. I tried, really I tried it, but maybe it’s just not meant for me.” Agatha put out the cigarette, half-smoked, no longer enjoying the sensation. </p><p>“Ralph was a chump. It’s no surprise you weren’t in love with him. He’s hard to love.” Peggy thought back to all the times she held her tongue when he used to speak down to Agatha or say something uncouth. It was a relief when they finally decided to divorce. </p><p>“But what if that was the best I could do? What if my mother was right? That I’m destined to be alone forever.” Agatha grimaced at the confession. </p><p>“Stop that. Your mother instilled in you an awful gift - one that nobody asks for. She gave you an endless capacity for doubt and self-hatred. But you’re not like her. You were an amazing mum to Nicky, and you’re a killer ballplayer. You have me, you have Wanda and the boys, all of our teammates would be there for you at the drop of a hat. You’re not alone.” Peggy reached across and put a hand on Agatha’s arm. </p><p>“I don’t know where to go from here. I love playing in the league. I love travelling. I love all of you girls. But I know this can’t go on forever. I’m 36. I’m one of the oldest players, and they keep recruiting teenagers these days. With those two teams folding, I think our time is ticking. What’s next for me?” </p><p>“You could do anything! Seriously. You’re whip smart, you’ve got money, and you’re not tied down. The world is your oyster, babe.” Peggy said it as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. </p><p>Agatha smiled at her friend’s optimism, “Thanks Peg. I just want to win one championship. I want it so bad.”</p><p>“You might need to expand your dreams. If we keep playing like we are, that one will be crossed off in no time.” </p><p>Agatha knew it was a possibility, but she couldn’t think much farther beyond that. She couldn’t think about Rio and the confusing feelings that surrounded the pitcher. She couldn’t let herself get distracted now, on the precipice of her goal. </p><p>“Auntie Aggie! Come play with us!” Billy yelled down from the shore below. </p><p>“Well, duty calls.” She said as she stood up to go play with the kids. </p><p>After another delicious dinner, this time prepared by Horsey, and a rambunctious game of charades with the entire group, Agatha and Rio retired downstairs for their final night in the lakehouse. </p><p>Agatha showered and sat down on her couch. Rio must have changed while she was in there because she was also in her PJs and lounging on top of her sleeping bag, staring up at nothing. </p><p>“Did I really piss you off with that canoe prank?” Rio asked out of the blue. </p><p>“Hmm? No, why?” </p><p>“You’ve been avoiding me all day.” </p><p>“I’ve been doing other things. I didn’t know you required my constant attention.” Agatha was caught off guard. She hadn’t been actively avoiding Rio. They just hadn’t spent much time doing the same activities today. </p><p>“If you say so. I didn’t want you to be mad at me.” </p><p>“I thought you liked it when I yelled at you.” Agatha joked. </p><p>It was Rio’s turn to be caught off guard, “Huh? I never said that!” She kicked her feet out and rocked up to sitting. </p><p>“You used to smirk at me when I yelled at you. I would see how your face would change during our little confrontations. I’m not blind, you know?” Agatha thought back to their first meeting and their subsequent encounters. At the time, she had thought Rio was doing it to be irritating or to get the upper hand. But now, she wasn’t so sure. </p><p>Rio ran her hands up and down her thighs as if she was wiping water off on them. She seemed uncomfortable or nervous. “No, that's not because I like being yelled at.”</p><p>“Then what? You like being yelled at…by me?” Agatha liked seeing Rio off-kilter for once. </p><p>Rio tried to scoff but it came off weak, more like a half-hearted laugh, “I just liked…well, I liked being around you.” </p><p>Now Agatha was on the back foot. She wasn’t used to anyone liking her company. A lifetime of pushing people away will generally have that effect. She resorted to her old favorite, deflection, “What about the other players? Don’t you like spending time with them too?”</p><p>“Sure, they’re fine. Lupe’s been a great mentor. Peggy’s a crack up. Everyone has been really welcoming. I never expected to feel so included.”</p><p>“What did you expect?” Agatha kept the conversation moving away from her. </p><p>“I don’t know. I had no frame of reference. I just wanted to make it into the league and get paid to play baseball. I had no other hopes besides that.” She paused and glanced across to Agatha. “Well I had one more.” </p><p>“Don’t say meeting me.” Agatha groaned out. </p><p>“Okay, I won’t say it…” Rio smiled and Agatha found herself staring at the slight gap between her two front teeth and the delicate lines around the edges of her mouth. </p><p>“Anyway,” Agatha continued. It was late but she didn’t feel tired yet. “Are you excited about the next few games?” </p><p>“Yeah, the Peaches are great competition. I’m mostly looking forward to the playoffs. What’s it like?”</p><p>“It feels like a reset. Like everyone is on a clean slate, ready to etch their happy ending into stone, but only if they can pry the chisel from the other person’s hands.” Agatha had only been to the playoffs twice in her career. The first time they had made it all the way to the finals and lost. The second time they were knocked out in a four game sweep in the first round. </p><p>“Would you bet on us?” Rio asked. </p><p>“To win it all?” Agatha ran her hand along her strong jawline in thought, “If I was a betting gal, I might. With you on the mound, with the current roster of hitters that we got, with my undeniable talent. Sure, why can’t it be us?”</p><p>Rio laughed, “Your humility is admirable.” </p><p>“What? Do you want me to lie?”</p><p>They cackled together at the brash statement. When the laughter finally subsided, Agatha got up to turn off the lamp, and they both settled down to rest. </p><p>“Goodnight Rio.” Agatha said softly as she tried to get comfortable on the borrowed pillow. </p><p>“Night. And thanks for being so…nice to me. I was worried when I got transferred to the Comets that you might ice me out or hate me.” Rio shared her fears now that the darkness obscured them both. There was a quiet safety when neither could see the other. </p><p>“You’re not so bad. I like talking to you.” Agatha confessed. </p><p>“I like talking to you too.” That was the last thing Rio said before letting sleep overtake her. </p><hr/><p>The bubble of the vacation popped the next day as they all packed up and said goodbye to the peaceful sanctuary away from baseball. It had been the perfect distraction from the upcoming stress and a great bonding experience for everyone. They felt refreshed and reinvigorated on their pursuit of greatness. </p><p>At practice that afternoon, Coach Grant was impressed at their focus and persistence. Everyone was working especially hard during batting practice to shore up their offense. Rio wasn’t going easy on them either. Agatha felt the heat behind every one of her pitches and saw how the team was slowly getting more and more hits as they adjusted to the speed. </p><p>During pitching practice, Agatha and Rio worked on the catcher signs. </p><p>“Do you prefer four-seam or two-seam for your fastball?” Agatha asked. </p><p>“Four-seam. I feel like I get more grip when I hold it across the seams and more control.” Rio replied. </p><p>“Alright, well I’ll throw down my index finger for the fastball. If I want it outside for a regular batter, I’ll use just my pinkie instead to indicate the positioning, and vice versa for a lefty batter, okay?” </p><p>Rio nodded. </p><p>“Two is always a curve. I’ll move my fingers either towards my left thigh or right thigh to show where I think you should put it. Since you don’t throw a slider, three will be for your changeup. I’ll only ever use my middle, ring, and pinkie fingers so you don’t get confused with the curve sign. And are you still intent on using a knuckleball?”</p><p>“I don’t throw it often, but yeah I like to have the option.” Rio said. </p><p>“Okay, we’ll need to go over when you like to use it, and then I’ll drop four fingers. If I put down my fist, that means I want a pitch out, so throw a high ball into the opposite batter box. I’ll call that if I see a runner that’s likely to steal a base. If I put my thumb out and gesture to a base, that means pick off, so if a runner has a huge lead off the base, throw to the base to get them out.” Agatha had given this rundown many times to many different pitchers over the years. </p><p>“Got it. And I usually use the knuckleball if I see someone struggle with the changeup or as a surprise after many fastballs in a row. It really throws off a batter’s sense of speed and timing.” Rio said. She had learned the pitch from her uncle and only used it a few times so far when playing for the Sallies. </p><p>“Alright, we’ll give it a try against the Peaches. Let’s practice the signs and then call it a night.” </p><p>After practice ended, Lilia spoke to the team in the locker room, “Girls, we are leaving on a bus tomorrow morning for Rockford at 9am. Here is a list of the rooming assignments for the hotel. Any complaints can be directed back into your head as there will be no changes.” </p><p>Agatha popped up to check the list taped to the door. Yes, she was with Peggy as usual. She scanned the names and saw Rio was with Lupe, and Wanda and the twins had their own room. </p><p>“It’s you and me, sweets.” She called to her old friend. Peggy extended her hand for a high-five. </p><p>“Aww shucks, why did they put me with Shirley?” Dottie sighed under her breath. The left fielder was nobody’s first choice because of her excessively loud humidifiers that she insisted on running all night long. </p><p>“Better luck next time, Dottie. Maybe if you bought a few crystals from Lilia, your fate would change.” Agatha joked. </p><p>Rio approached from the other side of the room, “How do you and Peggy always end up together?” </p><p>“A magician never shares her secrets.” She pretended to zip her mouth closed and Rio just stared at her. The pitcher threw her hands up and walked away when it was clear that Agatha had no intention to elaborate. </p><p>It was just under two hours on the bus to get to Rockford. Agatha sat beside Wanda, who detailed the latest episode of <em> Cabin B-13 </em>, a popular radio program following the fictional Dr. John Fabian through a weekly mystery. Agatha was less interested in radio but indulged her friend. It helped pass the time if nothing else. </p><p>The hotel in Rockford was on Kishwaukee Street, the Sunset Inn. It was built in the 1930s and already looked outdated, but the rooms each had ensuites, and it was only a 15 minute walk to Beyer Stadium.</p><p>“Game is at 6pm this evening. If you’re late, you’re off the roster.” Lilia passed out the keys with her usual stern warning. Nobody ever dared to be late. </p><p>Agatha spent the time in her room going over the Peaches lineup. She wanted to be prepared for every batter today and make sure she called the right pitches for Rio, who was starting. She went through her journal and synthesized all the notes on the team into a single page. Nickels favors outside pitches, Barbara can’t lay off a high fastball if her life depends on it, Hattie is allergic to off speed pitches. </p><p>When the sun started to drop in the sky, the team made their way down the street to the ballpark. In the locker room as they were getting changed, conversation shifted to talk of nicknames. </p><p>“Rio! Now that you’re a regular starter with the Comets, we really need to get you a nickname.” Peggy said. </p><p>“Yeah, Rio. Every great pitcher has a good nickname in this league. There’s Lefty on the Belles, Lupe is the Spanish Striker, and Knuckles on the Red Wings.” Helen explained. </p><p>Rio shrugged, “I don’t know. Nobody really calls me by a nickname at home.” </p><p>“You think people call me Buckets at home?” Loretta laughed. She had been given the moniker after her last name “Buckley.” </p><p>“We should give her a name to strike fear into the hearts of the batters. Something menacing or scary.” Dottie suggested. </p><p>“Rocket? Because of her speed?” Wanda threw it out there. </p><p>“Hmmm, Vixen Vidal?” Betty asked. </p><p>“No, we need something intimidating.” Peggy shook her head. </p><p>“What about the Raven? They’re often the symbol of ill fortune.” Horsey offered. </p><p>“Rio the Raven. That has a certain something to it.” Peggy said, looking towards the pitcher in question who bobbed her head side to side indecisively. </p><p>“The Reaper.” Agatha declared boldly, and the room was abuzz instantly with sounds of affirmation. </p><p>“Ooooh, Rio “The Reaper” Vidal. Now that’s a nickname. She’s here to take the soul of every batter who dares challenge her. She’s all-knowing, she’s ruthless, she’s inevitable.” Peggy loved the name immediately. </p><p>Rio was smiling widely, “I like it.” It felt like she was in, like she was part of the club now. </p><p>The game started with a bang as the Comets went up by one run in the very first inning. Rio gave up two hits as the Peaches fought back, but the defence was able to hold them and prevent anyone from scoring. </p><p>Agatha was up in the second inning and scorched a line drive right above the pitcher for a base hit. Fern advanced her to second base, but the next two batters went down on easy plays to first. Dottie struck out swinging on a close fastball, and the side was retired. </p><p>“Rio, this next group of batters is the best on their team. Let’s up the tempo and keep them guessing, alright?” Agatha counselled the pitcher as they took the field for the bottom of the second inning. </p><p>“I trust you.” Rio acknowledged and took to the mound. The crowd was loud as over 5,000 fans packed the stands. The Rockford fans were notoriously loyal and fervent supporters of their ball club. </p><p>Rio let the noise wash over her and quieted her mind. She closed her eyes and rolled her throwing arm to shake it loose. When she opened her eyes again, they immediately snapped to the shining blues behind the catcher’s mask.</p><p>Agatha watched Mary Richards come up to bat. Richie, as she was often called, was a jumpy hitter. She swung outside the zone at a higher than average percentage, but she was also more likely to get on base because of her risky swings. Agatha threw down a two for a curveball. </p><p>Rio accepted the sign and started her wind-up. Agatha watched the ball leave the pitcher’s hand and saw the deceptive arc as it started high and dropped down low. Mary swung as if she expected it to hit dead center and was shocked when she missed it completely for a strike. </p><p>The next fastball hit Agatha’s glove hard, and the batter watched it zoom past for strike two. Rio closed it out with a third heater in the bottom inside corner. </p><p>“Wow.” Mary breathed out as she made the walk of shame back to the home team dugout. </p><p>That word would be muttered several more times as Rio continued to dominate the next four innings, striking out another five batters. </p><p>“Let’s go Reaper, let’s go Reaper.” The Comets players shouted and clapped from their bench to cheer on their star pitcher. Even some fans started to join the chants. </p><p>When Bobbie Key came up to the plate, Agatha knew this would be the perfect test for Rio’s knuckleball. Bobbie had a great batting average and knew her stuff. She wasn’t often fooled but sometimes struggled with slower pitches. When she took her stance, Agatha called for the knuckleball right out of the gate. She knew Bobbie would be expecting a fastball. Rio almost always started with it, and it was her most dominant pitch. </p><p>The pitcher gave Agatha a subtle smile as she adjusted her grip on the ball. Her wind-up mirrored her normal delivery but when she released, the baseball had almost no spin on it at all. It looked like it was floating right towards the plate. Bobbie swung early anticipating the speed and watched with pain as the ball dropped into the glove after she’d already gotten the bat over the plate. Strike. </p><p><em>Wow</em>. This time it was Agatha who was impressed. </p><p>The Peaches tied it up in the seventh at 1-1, but the Comets got their bats going in the final inning and went ahead 4-1 for the win. Rio was relieved from the game in the eighth by Betty, but she still got the win on her record for her performance that game. </p><p>“Another solid win, Comets.” Coach Grant spoke to them in the dugout as they were packing up. “Let’s keep this up and sail through August. The playoffs are waiting for us!”</p>

<p>
<span>“Love the game of baseball and baseball will love you.” Babe Ruth</span>
</p>
</blockquote><p>
<span>“Nice job against those Peaches, girls. Just one loss isn’t too bad, right?” Gertie asked Peggy and Agatha over dinner on their first night back home.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not bad? It’s pretty damn good, I’d say.” Peggy replied in good spirits. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How many games do you have left?” Pearl asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“16 games until the playoffs start in September. We are guaranteed to make it at this point. It’s just a matter of positioning. First place gets the best match-up against the fourth place team, while second and third have to go against each other. Then, the winner of those games battles it out in the finals for the championship.” Agatha explained. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What other teams do you think will make it?” Gertie questioned as she cut her chicken with a knife and fork. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Blue Sox and us for sure. And then it’s a race between the Chicks, the Belles, and the Peaches. The Lassies have a pathway, but it’s so unlikely that I don’t see it happening.” Agatha tracked the team positioning very closely after every game. She liked to know her competition inside and out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whatever happened to those orphan teams? The ones that had to shut down.” Pearl wondered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Last I heard they were going on the road. I think the managers set up exhibition games all across the east coast and the south. They are trying to spark interest across the country. It’s to make money, but I think they are desperate for more talent. The pool of female ball players is shrinking fast.” Peggy said. They had heard from Coach Grant about the plans for the Sallies and the Colleens not long after Rio had joined them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well they need to get more organizations to start baseball leagues for the kiddos. If every young lady is stuck playing softball, there aren’t going to be many baseball stars to pick from in a few years.” Gertie said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded in agreement, “That’s the sad truth. I just hope they let us finish this year out at least. Whatever happens next is up to those that make so much more money than me. The crowds have been bigger than ever, but we’re losing all the top girls to marriage, babies, or more stable careers.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who are you playing next?” Pearl asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ve got the Lassies at home. They’re on a winning streak, but I don’t think they will be a problem. We’ve crushed them at every series over the past few years.” Peggy said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>That prediction was spot on. The Comets sent the Lassies packing with four straight wins in a row. Agatha bagged her 19th homer of the season. Rio racked up another win as a starting pitcher. Peggy was on a nine-game hitting streak, and even Wanda was setting personal records with her 30th RBI when she sent Dottie home on a double. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After their impressive series sweep, Coach Grant brought up a proposition at their afternoon practice the next day, “As many of you know, I played in the majors a few years ago.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The team members side-eyed each other and all let out a friendly collective groan. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, yeah. You might not be groaning once you hear this.” He gestured his hands like he was pushing down to try to quiet the chatter. “My old teammate, “Big Bear” Garcia pitches for the Cleveland Indians, and he said he could get me four tickets for their upcoming game against the White Sox in Chicago. The game is already sold out so that’s as many as he could get.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Everyone started whispering in excitement at the prospect of getting to see a major league game in person. “Well? Who gets to go?” Agatha was the first to pipe up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Coach smiled, “You all deserve it, so I figure the only fair way to do this is…a batting contest. Ten hits. 100 points for a homer, 50 points for outfield, 25 for infield, and 0 for foul balls or strikes. Top three batters get the tickets.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought you said there were four tickets?” Peggy looked at him with her eyes narrowed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, one’s for me, of course.” He admitted without shame. He was also a huge baseball fan and always enjoyed catching a game. The team showered him with “boos” that he welcomed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If I pitch for this, can I still be a batter?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Everyone can put their hat in. Can you pitch back-up, Lupe?” Coach looked at the other starting pitching who nodded. “Alright, you guys ready? Let’s do it!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>They sat in the dugout in batting order as Rio warmed up with Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nice and easy. Keep it to fastballs but take some heat off them.” The catcher called out as they got ready for the contest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Got it, boss.” Rio replied with a smile. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Coach Grant stood in the third base coach’s box, “Dottie, you’re first!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The southern belle stretched her neck as she walked out to the box, “Don’t kill my dreams, Reaper!” She yelled out to the pitcher. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tossed the pitches right over the plate. Dottie got four into the outfield (one hit off the fence just a few inches off a home run), three infield hits, and three foul balls. 275 points. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda put up an impressive 350, and Horsey got angry after only racking up 200. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Watch and learn, ladies!” Peggy strolled to the box using her bat as a cane. She got a chip off two good pitches which fell into the infield for 50 points, but then knocked a long ball out past the fences for the full hundred. After ten, her score sat at the top of the table with 425. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Shirley got unlucky with three foul balls, which dropped her down to 225. Then it was Agatha’s turn. Helen swapped out as catcher as she went to grab her favorite bat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Put ‘em here, Rio!” Agatha extended her bat across the plate, showing the pitcher where she wanted to swing. Rio gave her a conciliatory nod.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>The first ball came right on target and Agatha transferred all her power through her hips to send the ball soaring to the farthest part of center field for a home-run. She beamed as Rio turned and watched the ball fall over the fence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Five more dotted the outfield and two more went yard. One should have been a homer but it took an arcing curve and landed just foul for a disappointing zero points. As Agatha’s strength waned, the final pitch popped straight up into the infield, but she knocked Peggy down to take the number one spot with 575. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s what I’m talking about! Great work, Angel.” Coach Grant applauded her performance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Fern, Edna, and Buckets put up solid scores but didn’t crack the top three. Flo managed to take third as she pushed Wanda down with a score of 375. Sugar tied Dottie’s score, and then Helen broke 300 but it still wasn’t enough. Lupe managed to get a homer but couldn’t repeat her success and finished with 325. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The young substitute, Betty, approached with a fierce determination in her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s go batter! Hit it out of here, Betty!” The team cheered on the rookie. </span>
</p><p>
<span>To everyone’s surprise, she connected on the first pitch and launched the ball clear of the fences by several feet. Even Betty’s jaw dropped at the sight, she had never hit a homer before. The onlookers jumped and cheered at the impressive sight. She continued launching them into the outfield and connected with a few grounders to take the third spot from Flo with a total of 400 even. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was only one batter left. Lupe took the mound as Rio jogged over to get her bat. She just needed to beat Betty’s score to get a ticket. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pushed her mask up as Rio came closer, “Hey, don’t worry, I’ll give you a play-by-play of the game if you don’t earn a ticket.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio scoffed and kicked her feet into place in the dirt, “Don’t get your hopes up, babe.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lupe fired in the first pitch and Rio swung hard and missed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ooh, do you want the pitcher to slow it down for you?” Agatha heckled her from her crouching position, enjoying the opportunity to get under her skin for once. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio did not respond. Instead, she took her blasé stance again as Lupe wound up. The crack off the bat echoed in Agatha’s ears as the ball flew high and deep towards left field. Rio turned her head and smirked while the catcher could only watch the home-run hit the grass. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nothing more to say?” Rio asked without looking back as she awaited the next pitch. Agatha grizzled but couldn’t respond. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The talented pitcher knocked four into the outfield, two more over the fence, and one grounder on a high fastball. Her final pitch was headed for right field but dropped just before the grass so only counted for a quarter. She was just barely off Agatha’s total and managed to steal second with 550. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Almost had me.” Agatha pushed Rio gently with her catcher’s mitt as they walked together towards the team. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I should have let that high one go by.” Rio shook her head regretting that one pitch. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Better luck next time.” Agatha replied. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Coach Grant stood in front of the lined up team and pulled the tickets out of his pocket, “Maybe I should incentivize you more - that was the best hitting I’ve seen in practice since I started coaching you gals! Come up and get your prize, Agatha, Rio, and Peggy!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The three winners each took a ticket and waved it in their hand with glee. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Meet me here on the 17th, and I’ll drive us to the game. Congratulations again.” He said to them, “Everyone else, I’ll see you tomorrow for our first game against the Daisies.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They had a doubleheader against Fort Wayne to start off the series and each team took one win. The Daisies had no path to the playoffs but the team still played with all the heart and toughness of a group that hated to lose. They didn’t make it easy, but the Comets pulled off two more wins at home and watched their dreams come clearer and clearer into focus. </span>
</p><p>
<span>On August 17th, Peggy and Agatha walked together to the ballpark to meet the Coach for their big day out. Peggy looked sharp in a navy blue dress with a high neckline and contrasting red bands highlighting her waist. Agatha, meanwhile, opted for a two-piece peplum top dress in burgundy - the belt, side draping, and stiff shoulders gave her an alluring hourglass shape. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Their hair was elegantly styled in brushed out waves as they made their way along the sidewalk, their low heels clicking with each step. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you think it’ll be a close game?” Peggy asked. Agatha followed the Red Sox closely, so she had a general knowledge on the standings in the American League. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have you seen the White Sox record this season? They are hopeless! Cleveland is currently in second behind Boston, who are leading the division, but they are looking really strong.” Agatha explained. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, there’s Rio!” Peggy pointed across the street as their teammate approached from the other direction. Agatha stared at the pitcher who looked cool and casual in a white collared, short sleeve blouse paired with a tartan pleated skirt in brown and green. She had on a pair of slingbacks and a fancy beret. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio whistled low when she caught sight of the pair of them, “I fear I’ve underdressed now that I’ve seen you two beauties.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh hush, you look amazing, hun.” Agatha greeted her with a swift hug as Peggy did the same. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Coach Grant pulled up in his Chevrolet Fleetmaster, the one splurge he let himself have these past few years. It was strange seeing him outside his baseball uniform. He was wearing a well-loved light tan suit with white shirt and red tie. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m one lucky fella to be able to take you three beautiful women out on my own!” He exclaimed as he stepped out and opened the passenger doors for them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks Coach.” Peggy said as she stepped into the front seat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Call me Doc while we’re off the field, please.” His real name was Victor, but he’d earned the nickname Doc in the minor leagues due to his skill at saving a team on the brink of a loss with his home base plays as catcher. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio and Agatha were once again together, this time in the backseat for the hour-long journey to Chicago. They were off to Comiskey Park, near the south side of the city. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have you ever been to a major league game, Rio?” Peggy turned and asked as the car pulled onto the road. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head, “Nope, only in my dreams. I grew up listening to games on the radio, but there are no teams south of Kentucky and definitely not all the way down in Florida, so I’ve never had a chance.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve only been twice. Peggy and I saw the Cubs play our first year in the league when Mr. Wrigley offered tickets to all the girls who made the rosters. And then, we went to see the Red Sox play in Boston last October after our season ended. It’s amazing, you’re gonna love it.” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finally arrived and walked up to the gates, the entire area was swarmed with fans. There were tens of thousands of people vying to either get tickets or get inside. Rio grabbed Agatha’s hand to avoid getting lost in the crowd, and she enjoyed the feeling of security as they slowly made their way to the ticket takers. She tried not to read into the innocent gesture but loved the feeling of connection. Agatha didn’t release her hand until they were all the way to their seats.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>The seats were good as they navigated to the third base side and took their spots about twenty rows back from the field. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow, how many people does this place hold?” Rio asked as she looked around at the packed stands that surrounded the entire diamond. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“They say 50,000.” Doc leaned over and said. It was an unfathomable amount of people. Their games typically topped out at around 5,000 (if they were lucky). </span>
</p><p>
<span>As game time approached, they heard the announcer come over the booming speakers, “Ladies and gentleman, as you may have heard this morning on the wire, our sport and our world has lost a giant. Babe Ruth passed away last night in his sleep at the age of 53. He changed baseball forever and will never be forgotten. We ask you all to stand now as we observe a moment of silence for this titan of the game.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and her teammates looked at each other in complete and utter shock. They hadn’t read the paper this morning or listened to the radio, so they hadn’t heard this devastating news. Tears fell from Doc’s eyes as the reality hit him that Babe Ruth was really gone. Even Agatha’s eyes began to well up. It seemed unbelievable. How could baseball go on without him?</span>
</p><p>
<span>He was one of the few star pitchers who was also a power slugger. Known as the Sultan of Swat or the Great Bambino, Ruth was the greatest baseball player to ever live. As they all stood and felt the collective silence of fifty thousand stunned fans grappling with the loss, Rio took Agatha’s hand again and stroked it gently with her thumb as a show of comfort and a sign of support. She felt the catcher gently squeeze her hand as the moment passed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now, we’ll hear the national anthem performed by the Chicago Chamber Choir.” The announcer stated as a large group of singers walked out onto the field. The crowd remained standing for the anthem, which was immediately followed by “Play ball!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t believe Babe Ruth is gone. I never thought it would happen.” Peggy said as they sat back down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tell me about it. He wasn’t an old man either. He retired before I was called up, but he’s not much older than me.” Doc said, looking shell-shocked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The White Sox took to the field, and Bill Wight was the starting pitcher. The fans favored the home team, but there was a very sizable mix of Cleveland fans throughout the stands given the close proximity of the teams. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The first two batters grounded out and the third hit a long fly ball to right field that was snagged for an easy inning. Then, the Indians were on the field. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, check this out!” Doc nudged her as the new pitcher slowly walked out from the dugout to a blend of cheers and boos. “He just signed with the Indians this year. One of the greatest pitchers in the Negro Leagues, Satchel Paige.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They watched the incredibly tall Black man take the mound and Rio leaned forward in interest, “No way! I’ve heard of him. He played for the Guayama Witch Doctors in the Puerto Rican League! My Uncle used to talk about him all the time. I think he still holds the strikeout record on the island.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No kidding, I saw him when he played with the Kansas City Monarchs. Just watch his technique. He’s 42! I worried if he would still have the juice, but he’s on another level. His catalog of pitches is crazy. Watch for his eephus pitch, it’s a high curve, or his tailing fastball.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Major League Baseball had only integrated the year prior, 1947, when the Brooklyn Dodgers signed Jackie Robinson as a first baseman. Satchel Paige was the 7th Black player so far in the league. He was also the oldest debutant in league history. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched enraptured as Paige started his windup. He leaned back then leaned forward and separated his arms and threw them back behind him before bringing them together up on top of his cap, lifting his knee up and striding forward while releasing the ball. It was a hypnotic rhythmic ritual that seemed like second nature to him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched Rio watching the talented pitcher. Her eyes were locked on his every movement. Agatha saw her mouth open slightly in awe as a blazing strike was called by the ump, and she watched the frustration break across Rio’s brow when a close pitch was deemed a ball. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The game’s over there.” Peggy elbowed her softly and pointed towards the field with a smile. Agatha clicked her tongue to stop herself biting back at her nosy friend. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a close contest as both pitchers and their defenses held the score at 0-0. It wasn’t until the bottom of the fourth inning that the Indians got two men on base and center fielder Larry Doby batted in the lead runner to put them ahead 1-0. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The sound of the crowd was almost deafening as the White Sox fans tried to rally their team. Unfortunately for them, this Cleveland group was incredibly strong. Satchel Paige never faced more than four batters each inning as he struck out several of his opponents and the defense handled any ball hit their way. Both pitchers lasted the full nine innings, and when the game finished Paige was credited with a shutout as the Chicago side failed to score a run against him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was amazing!” Rio raved as they made their way out of the ballpark. “I’ve never seen pitching like that in all my life.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hope it’s inspired you. Pitching continues to evolve thanks to all this talent in the majors, so there is always more to learn.” Coach said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Definitely. I can’t wait to try out some of those moves from Satchel Paige. I wish I could study his grip and movement up close.” Rio was practically bursting with energy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha loved the way Rio showed her excitement so forthrightly. She didn’t try to hide her joy or temper her feelings. It was such a refreshing contrast to the way Agatha had been raised and the standards of the time for women. </span>
</p><p>
<span>On the ride back to Kenosha, Rio sat up front with Doc and they gushed over Satchel Paige’s long list of unique pitches. Peggy and Agatha chatted quietly in the backseat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thomas from the fire department asked me out on a date tonight. He said one of his co-workers is single, handsome, and would love to tag along if you join. What do you say?” Peggy proposed. After their conversation at the lake house, she had been trying to find potential suitors for Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How old is he? I don’t want to waste my time with some twenty-something.” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s thirty. Was engaged at some point but didn’t go through with it. Loves baseball. I’ll be there with you, what could it hurt?” Peggy saw Agatha looking for any excuse to say no. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you going out later, Agatha?” Rio stopped her conversation and turned around to look over her shoulder. “I’ve got a spare ticket to the cinema. Lupe was meant to go with me but isn’t feeling well. I was going to ask if you were interested.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t have to think too hard, “Sure, Rio. That sounds way more fun than a blind date with some firemen. See if Helen or Wanda will go with you instead, Peggy.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t see Rio’s wide smile as she turned back around and kept talking with the coach the rest of the ride home. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Coach dropped them off at their host house. Rio leaned out the window and said, “I’ll come by at 6, and we can walk together to the movies.” Agatha nodded and waved as the car pulled away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t believe you’re ditching me.” Peggy huffed as they walked up to the front door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry, I’m just not in the mood to suffer through small talk with some townie.” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Welcome back, how was the game?” Gertie looked up from her knitting. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was a blast! We’ll also both be out tonight, so no need to save us a seat at the table.” Peggy knew that Pearl would be upset if they skipped out on dinner without letting them know. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was only two hours until they were both set to leave. Agatha threw herself into her bed to relax, while Peggy began the long process of primping and preening for a date. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, what’s going on between you and Rio?” Peggy asked as she applied her eyeliner delicately. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha flipped over and sat up against the headboard, ‘What? We’re just going to the movies.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy looked at her roommate via the mirror and leveled a knowing gaze. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared back and finally broke the silence, “What are you suggesting?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve been around the block enough times to spot chemistry, and you two have enough chemistry to form an atomic bomb.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed aloud, “We’re just friends! Can’t two friends go out to the movies together?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy put down her pencil and shifted in the stool to face Agatha, “You can’t tell me that you don’t see it! The way she watches you, the way you stare at her, how she hangs on your every word, how you always end up together. Come on, she’s smitten with you! And if I didn’t know any better, I’d say you were dizzy with her.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“But she’s a…she!” Agatha threw her head back against the hardwood behind her and raised her arm to cover her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And? I knew you were self-involved, but have you really not noticed that like a quarter of this league is queer?” Peggy asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha dropped her arm and looked over at her friend, “What? How do you know?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How do you not know?” Peggy threw her arms up in exasperation and went back to putting eyeshadow on. “Remember when we were on the Peaches? If you took your head out of your journal every now and then, you would have noticed half of those gals were dating each other or other ladies in Rockford.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“But…isn’t it illegal? It’s not natural. I’m not…I mean I’ve never…” Agatha’s mind was blown by this revelation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just because it’s not accepted doesn’t mean it’s wrong. This country is so puritanical about sex.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t think it’s bad?” Agatha asked. She was so conflicted. In her mind, the idea of being with a woman seemed wrong. Maybe it was all the fire and brimstone sermons that she had attended as a child, or the constant barrage of negative news stories about ‘deviants.’ </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think if two women love each other, then who am I to say they shouldn’t? It's hard enough to find love in this world. If they would risk their wellbeing, their jobs, their reputations, just to be with each other, then they deserve to be happy.” Peggy said. She could see Agatha struggling internally and wanted to provide the kind words that could maybe help her on her way. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you think Rio’s willing to risk that for…me?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know. I can’t speak for her, but I think you owe it to her and to yourself to see if it’s something. You said you wanted to find love one day, what if you’ve just been excluding half the population?” Peggy applied a bright pink rouge to her cheeks, as if she were completely unbothered at the enormous suggestion she has just given. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, so if I take your advice…not saying I will…but if I did, what next? I can’t just tell her all this.” Agatha knew Rio like women. She just really hadn’t considered that she might be part of that category. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know you know how to flirt. The way you speak to Wanda sometimes borders on indecent. And I’ll pick out your outfit. There’s no way I’m letting you step out in a raggedy old frock.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio rang the doorbell at 5:55pm, Agatha ran to get the door before anyone else could butt in and pepper Rio with endless questions. She threw open the door and slipped out with a hasty “Goodbye!” before striding down the driveway towards downtown. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whoa, Agatha. Wait up!” Rio spun on the stoop and trailed after her companion who had left her in the dust. “I like your outfit. That color looks great on you.” Peggy had picked out a green crepe de chine dress with strong shoulders and a mildly titillating v-neck.   </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha slowed down to let Rio catch up, “Thanks. That’s a nice dress.” She admired the bold red color that matched Rio’s lipstick. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a decent trek to the picture house, but it was a warm night and the sun had yet ot set, “What movie are we seeing anyway?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Amazing Mr. X. It’s a horror thriller, I hear it’s a hair-raiser!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh gosh, I’m not a big horror fan.” Agatha said nervously. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t worry, I’ll hold your hand through the scary parts.” Rio admitted with a smile. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grinned back. </span>
<em>
<span>Okay, maybe she is actually interested in me. How did I not notice this before?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Is this how you swoon all the girls?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just the special ones.” Rio winked and Agatha felt her stomach swoop. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh. </span>
</em>

<blockquote>
<p>
<span>“World War II was the really big one for my generation. . . . Times changed, women had to leave the home and the kitchen. Now that the men are coming back, you women get back in the kitchen! I’m sorry, you’ve opened the door of opportunity and we’re not in the kitchen, we’re out in the world being productive and doing other things and having other opportunities.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>Delores “Dolly” Brumfield</span>
</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>
<span>In the tight recording booth, Agatha and Rio were sitting next to each other across from a well-groomed, smooth talking radio host. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“While women across the country are getting back to their household duties and graciously giving up their positions to returning veterans, there is one place where ladies are still on top. The All-American Girls Professional Baseball League is still going strong here in the Midwest, and today I’m interviewing two of its top stars, Agatha Harkness and Rio Vidal from the Kenosha Comets.” David O’Connell, host of WXRP-Chicago, had invited a few players to the studio at the local station to help boost interest in the upcoming playoffs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks for having us, Davey.” Agatha leaned into the microphone. She had been on the radio a few times and enjoyed the attention. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The pleasure is all mine. As a sports journalist, it's not often that I get the opportunity to sit with such lovely ladies like you and Ms. Vidal. Now, my first question, how long have you been playing pro ball?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio scooted her chair forward and pulled the mic towards her, “This is my rookie season. I was helping to support my family back in Florida, so I wasn’t able to try out prior to this year.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow, and now you’re heading to the playoffs with the Comets! What about you, Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve been fortunate enough to play in this league since its inception five years ago. I’ve never won a championship before, so I hope this year is my year.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your team has a really impressive record, and there are only 8 more games in the regular season. From the looks of things, it seems like you are the favorites.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know baseball, Davey. It’s never as easy as it seems. We’re lucky to have an incredible pitcher like Rio here, but all the top teams this year have good bullpens and even better hitting lineups. We’re going to have to give it our all every single game to make it to the finals.” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well said. What do you say to the people who say women shouldn’t be playing baseball? I know there are many who argue this sport should be left to the men.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tried to keep a calm face despite the rage building inside her. She felt Rio’s hand on her thigh under the table, which didn’t help lower her heart rate. “I would say that those people should come to one of our games before they pass judgement. We can pitch, hit, run, field, and play just as good as the men. And our games only cost a fraction of a major league ticket. It’s the perfect entertainment for the whole family.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Baseball is the national pastime, why should we be excluded from it just because of our gender?” Rio added. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Davey nodded, “That’s a fair question and a more than fair proposition. If you want to see what these gals are talking about, take a drive over to Kenosha this Thursday through Sunday at 6pm nightly as the Comets face off against the Blue Sox. My listeners can enjoy 25 cents off the regular admission if you mention Davey sent you!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The producer gave the thumbs up and the recording light turned off. Davey turned to them, “Great work and good luck on your games. We’ll have to have you back on if you win it all.” Agatha agreed and shook his hand. Rio moved to shake his hand as well and Agatha immediately missed the warmth on her thigh. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They hadn’t discussed what was happening between them yet. After their movie date, where Agatha had spent most of the night covering her eyes and gripping Rio’s hand as if it were her only tether to the world, they hadn’t had a moment alone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But something had shifted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It didn’t even need to be said. They both felt the change. It was like they were now teetering on the edge of a cliff. They hadn’t tumbled off together yet, but it was now a precarious balance. It felt like it could go either way. </span>
</p><p>
<span>At practice that evening, Rio was generous with her touches - from subtle squeezes of the shoulder in the locker room to lingering hand holds after rousing high-fives. Agatha didn’t pull away despite every voice in her head wondering if this was right or wrong. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Flo, you’re going to start tomorrow’s game. Let’s show these Blue Sox who they are dealing with. Have a good rest, and see you back here tomorrow.” The coach said before dismissing them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After most of the team had cleared out, Rio grabbed her bag and made for the exit. She stopped at the payphone along the street to make a quick call. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jen?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio! I thought you lost my number, where the hell have you been?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry, it’s been nonstop. We’re going to the playoffs! We just have a few more games to determine our standing.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I knew you could do it! See what you can accomplish when you aren’t distracted by pretty girls.” Jen said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“About that…” Rio began. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No! Please don’t tell me you’re still hung up on that catcher.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think she likes me back, Jen. No, don't scoff at me. I’m serious. We went out last night to the movies, and she held my hand. She goes out of her way to spend time with me.” Rio felt light and floaty at the thought of Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What if she’s just being nice?” Jen questioned. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha Harkness is not just nice. She couldn’t fake being nice if her life depended on it.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, why is she wasting time with you?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ha-ha. Not funny. I’m going to tell her how I feel.” Rio had been holding it back for so long now. She didn’t know how much longer she could wait. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t very well stop you, but are you sure? You don’t have to do this. What if you throw this all away? What if you get kicked out of the league?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio paused and considered it. Getting paid to play baseball professionally was all she ever dreamed about, all she had ever wanted for her life. “Ugh, why do you have to be such a fire extinguisher?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m your voice of reason. You can thank me later. It’s late here, I’ve got to wake up early for work in the morning. Not all of us live such comfortable lives! Remember when you prayed for this job, don’t throw it away now!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Talk to you later.” Rio hung up, more conflicted than she had been at the start of the call. She knew that Agatha was interested, that she was opening up to her, that she was letting her in. There was such a dramatic change in the way they interacted now compared to when they had first met. Rio knew it wasn’t simply platonic. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>But was Agatha ready for more? Did she truly understand the risks? Did she want just a fling or did she want something more? </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t want to be just another experiment, especially not when the consequences could be devastating. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>If the Comets won two of the games against the Blue Sox, they would clinch the top spot definitively. The stands were packed, thanks in part to the increased promotion and excitement about the upcoming playoffs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Flo led them to an easy 3-0 victory in the first game on Thursday night. Agatha went three for four at the plate, and Dottie hit a killer triple in the seventh inning. Rio had been their biggest cheerleader on the bench as she rested her arm, preparing for her next start. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Friday night games were always incredibly popular. As folks finished their work week and kids finished school, they loved to come down to the ballpark for a cheap hotdog and a rousing game of baseball. This Friday was no different. As the Comets entered the dugout, they could hear the overwhelming noise of the fans. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did they give out free tickets or something?” Wanda popped her head out to look around at the filled stands. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re here for me, I think.” Agatha primped her hair and pulled out her lipstick tube to reapply before heading out to the field. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio whispered to Peggy, “Does she really believe that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She doesn’t </span>
<em>
<span>not </span>
</em>
<span>believe it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Gather round, gather round.” Coach Grant waved them into a tighter circle, “One more win. That’s it. One win between us and winning the regular season. We can coast to the end if we finish it here. This is the most talented team that I’ve ever been a part of, and I know that we can put this to bed. Who’s with me?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The team yelled out together in a satisfying release of collective energy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Coach raised his voice to match their intensity, “That’s right! Hands in. Comets on three. One, two, three.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“COMETS!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>They were in the field first, and Agatha walked out with Rio in lockstep with each other, already setting that easy rhythm together that would carry throughout the game. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve got this. Don’t focus on the crowd, just look at me, okay? Focus on me.” Agatha could tell that Rio was taking in the loud racket around them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced over slowly, and their eyes met. It was a moment of calm in the middle of a hurricane. Despite their bodies carrying them forward in separate directions, all they could see was each other in that singular pause before it all began.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha brought her caged mask down over her face but kept her eyes trained on the pitcher standing fifty feet away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Corky Arnold was the first batter for South Bend, a tall clumsy farmgirl who somehow dominated at first base.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>The first pitch was a high heater at the chest. A perfect kick off to get things going, and Corky didn’t even swing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ball.” The umpire said without emotion. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>What? </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha turned to look at him because that pitch was close but should have been a strike. She had well and truly caught enough to know the difference. She didn’t recognize the man standing behind her. </span>
<em>
<span>Must be a new guy, maybe he’s still finding his zone. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She called for a change-up next. Rio had excellent placement with this pitch and could paint the corners of the strike zone. The windup, the pitch. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ball.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed aloud. Even the batter looked back in confusion. That pitch had been just slightly inside but level with the batter’s belly button. Agatha looked to her coach who was also looking puzzled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey blue!” A man in the stands behind home plate shouted, “I’ve seen potatoes with better eyes than you!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled behind her mask. Hecklers could be a pain in the butt when they had their sights set on you, but when they went after the umps it was pretty entertaining. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Let’s really test him. </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha dropped a single finger for another fastball, down the middle. As the ball came in Corky swung with all her might and missed. The ump called a strike due to the swing, so Agatha called the same pitch again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>This time the ball left Rio’s hand and smacked into the catcher’s mitt with ferocity, bang on target. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ball.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha jumped up and turned around, “That was a strike.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The umpire removed his mask, “I called it a ball. It was high.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know what you were looking at, but that was dead center.” Agatha argued back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I suggest you turn around and get back to the game.” He had his hands on his hips and had a good five inches on her as he stared Agatha down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She knew a losing game when she saw one and bit down on her bottom lip, crouching back down behind the plate.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was tossing the ball up and down to herself, waiting for the game to restart. Agatha could see the frustration growing in the pitcher. She called for a curveball. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Corky connected this time and sent a weak ground to the shortstop who tossed it easily to Wanda at first for an out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Janet James was up next. The first pitch was a fastball, Agatha barely had to move her glove to catch it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ball.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kicked the dirt next to the mound in anger at the call. That should have been a strike. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A fan screamed out, “Hey ump! I’ve heard better calls between two tin cans and a piece of string!” To which, many in the crowd and the dugout laughed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Time!” Agatha called and put her hand up to stop the game. She turned and took her mask off again. “You’re joking, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The umpire looked to be in his 50s, hard-faced and hulkling. “Look missy, where’s your coach? I’ll speak to him about any issues with my judgement.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stomped along the third base line to fetch the coach, “He will only talk to another man.” She spat out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Coach Grant accompanied the catcher back and said, “Is there a problem?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The umpire crossed his arms, “Your catcher is questioning my calls.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“If she didn’t, I was about to.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Excuse me?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can tell you’re new around here, but this is a professional league. The All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. We expect professional umpires too.” Coach Grant knew this man’s type. The way he was looking at the players with disdain gave him away instantly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The umpire opened and closed his mouth. Whatever he had expected the coach to say, it wasn’t this. He pointed out to the pitcher, “But sir, she’s not even American.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had stepped away to give them space but at that comment she whirled right around and bounded over, “What the </span>
<em>
<span>fuck</span>
</em>
<span> did you just say?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Some fans gasped in the crowd and both Rio and the batter ran over. The umpire growled, “You can’t speak to me like that!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you’re going to call this game like a racist pig then I can damn well speak to you however I want.” Agatha snarked as she stood toe to toe with the ump. She could see his rapidly reddening face and questioned for just a second whether she had taken it too far. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re out! Get off this field!” He screamed and pointed to the dugout with rage. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared and then hawked loudly and spat at his feet into the dirt before striding away to leave. The man seethed at the crude action but had no further power to sanction her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey! You can’t throw her out! That’s not fair!” Rio cried out in objection at the scene. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you want to join her?” The umpire turned towards her, chest puffing now. The crowd was just as fed up with the official and shouted their boos loudly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated but then threw her glove down, “I’m not playing if you’re the one officiating.” She followed Agatha’s tracks off the diamond. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Coach Grant turned his head to shout after her, “Don’t leave. Don’t let Agatha go either. Give me a sec.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was panicking internally as she avoided eye contact with the players on the bench and quickly cut through the dugout to the locker room. She saw Agatha opening the door and followed her in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The catcher turned, “Rio, what are you doing in here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I got thrown out too.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What??” Agatha’s eyes widened in surprise, “They need you out there. We need this win.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nobody’s ever stood up for me like that. I wasn’t about to keep playing if that bastard was going to keep calling the game.” Rio said. She still couldn’t believe that Agatha would risk the win for her like this. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was bullshit. He might get away with that in some places, but not here. You don’t deserve that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks, you shouldn’t have done that. Thank you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’d have stood up for any of these girls.” Agatha shrugged a shoulder, trying to play it cool. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“But would you have gotten thrown out for any of them?” Rio prodded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who can say? It’s never come up before.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You could just say you like me. It won’t kill you to say you like me the most. This is now the second time you’ve been tossed because of me” Rio poked Agatha in the stomach playfully to goad her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha jumped away to try to avoid the ticklish taunts, “Don’t make me regret it, Vidal.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio started chasing her, and they circled the locker room in a childish game of tag - all their previous problems fading away to a silly little diversion. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hello?” Peggy was standing in the doorway watching the game with a self-satisfied smile on her face. The two women stopped dead in their tracks when they realized they weren’t alone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry to break up…whatever this is, but Coach wants you both back out there. I think he talked down that umpire and either threatened his job or his life if he doesn’t start calling strikes.” Peggy explained. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha quickly went to pick up her ball cap that had fallen on the ground during their game and the three of them walked back out together. In the dugout, Coach Grant was waiting, tapping his foot impatiently, “Go on, back to it. If he makes one more egregious mistake, we’re all leaving and taking the forfeit.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, sir.” Rio said and grabbed her glove off the bench, someone must have picked it up for her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha put a hand on her shoulder, “I’ll be out there with you the whole time, okay?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt her heart jump and nodded shyly as they went up the steps onto the dirt again. The fans roared their approval as their star pitcher and catcher emerged again, signalling the start of the game again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha crouched down in her usual spot and ignored the man hovering behind her. Janet was still up to bat, the count still stood at one ball, no strikes. The catcher called for a changeup. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The ball left Rio’s hand as it crossed her body and travelled a deceptive line right to Agatha’s mitt. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Strike.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The smile on Rio’s face was contagious as Agatha grinned right back. Whatever the coach had said to the numbskull umpire seemed to work because Rio struck out the next two batters in a row to end the inning. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s go, team. Get on base, come on.” Coach cheered them on as they grabbed their bats. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dottie hit a single and advanced to second thanks to a knock by Wanda. Horsey hit a long flyball to center that was caught, and then Peggy grounded into an unlucky double-play. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The fans started getting antsy in the eighth inning when the score was still tied at zero. Both teams were fighting so hard on defense that nobody was able to put a run up yet. Rio was throwing as well as ever, but the Blue Sox pitcher was also having a strong night. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re doing great, Rio. Keep it up. We’ll get ‘em.” Agatha tried to reassure the pitcher as they walked out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Unfortunately, Nancy Smith took a chop at a curveball and sent it to the far corner for a triple. Rio’s face fell as she watched the ball roll to the fence and the batter round the bases. Agatha took an extra moment resetting to give Rio a second to catch her breath. She couldn’t lose her nerve now, not with a runner on third. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Pinky Moore came up next and took two balls before laying down a bunt. The ball popped perfectly and rolled toward the pitcher. Agatha ran to grab it and saw Nancy touch home behind her. </span>
<em>
<span>Fuck. </span>
</em>
<span>She fired it to first and was able to get the force out, but the sacrifice bunt had worked, and the Blue Sox were now up by one. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They got out of the inning without any further damage but now needed to score two to end this. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Shirley was able to hit a ball towards third and make it to first safely. Then it was Agatha’s turn. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She gripped the bat loosely, feeling the grain of the wood under her hands, and stared down at the opposing pitcher, Dot Krick. She had been pitching for two seasons now and had a curveball that could cross your eyes, but Agatha had studied her well. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The first pitch was a low fastball. Agatha could see its trajectory as it came in. She channeled her power, her anger at the close-minded umpire, her confusing pull towards Rio, her desire to win, and loaded her swing with all of these intense feelings. As the ball arrived in the sweet spot, she let it all go. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Angel crushes the ball to left field. Watch it soar, folks. Back, back, back. That ball is GONE! Home run!” The announcer in the stadium yelled in excitement as the fans jumped and screamed while Agatha jogged around the bases. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she got back to the dugout everyone came to pat her on the back and congratulate her. Billy and Tommy gave her approximately thirty high-fives, they were so excited. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How do you hit it so far?” Rio shook her head in disbelief and gratitude. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Some of us are just gifted.” Agatha stood tall with her chest out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I’m serious.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha put her bat down and sat beside the pitcher, “I try to imagine all the emotions in my head as fuel for my body and then if the right pitch comes in, that’s like the spark that ignites it all. So much of this game is mental. You have to see it and make it happen.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>They held the Sox in the top of the ninth inning and were up to bat again. They just needed one run to walk it off and end the game. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Fossey struck out swinging. Then Buckets hit a solid single. Rio was up next. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Go on, Reaper! You got this!” Wanda cheered her on. Agatha watched nervously. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood in the batter’s box and got set. She thought of Agatha’s advice and tried to conjure powerful feelings. She thought about placing first in the league, about winning it for her team, about Agatha’s smile, about Agatha’s hair, about Agatha’s hands, Agatha, Agatha, Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Crack</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The sound ripped her from her obsessive spiral, and she couldn’t believe it as the baseball took off in the air. At some point, she must have swung the bat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Run! Run, Rio!” Someone called from the dugout, which forced her to start running to first. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The announcer’s voice shouted, “And that ball is outta here! It’s another home run for the Comets! The first one for the pitcher, Rio “the Reaper” Vidal. They’ve won it, it’s all over. The Comets win! The Comets win!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>As Rio rounded third, the entire team poured out onto the field to meet her at home. When she touched the plate, Agatha was there, lifting her up in a tight embrace as the rest of the team joined into a group hug. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She felt the catcher’s breath against her ear despite the commotion surrounding them, “Attagirl.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio gasped and felt her heart pound just as hard as it had when her bat had connected with the ball. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she pulled back, Agatha gave her a swift kiss on the cheek before the team swept her up on their shoulders and carried her around the field in joyous celebration. As fans cried out her name and people stretched to wave at her, Rio was too lost in the tender feeling of Agatha’s lips on her skin to care much about anything else. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>They went on to win the remaining two games against the Blue Sox. The Comets were going into the playoffs as the number one seed in the league. There was just one series left on the road before the postseason began, but they could take it easy now. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your room assignments for the Grand Rapids trip are on the board. Season’s almost over, no complaining.” Lilia droned out after posting the handwritten paper up in the locker room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t bother to rush over, she knew she would be with Peggy as usual. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What the…” Peggy ran her finger down the list, “Why am I rooming with Dottie?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s head snapped up, “What?” She ran over to the list and scanned for her name. Agatha Harkness was written in Lilia’s neat cursive right beside…Rio Vidal. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey Roomie.” Rio sidled up beside her, looking at the list. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What…how did you do this?” Agatha narrowed her eyes at the smug pitcher. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought you said a magician never reveals their secrets.” Rio snarked back. In reality, she was now the owner of three sets of Tupperware that she would never use thanks to one of Lilia’s many side hustles. But if a bit of plastic was all that stood between her and a room with Agatha, it was worth it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha contemplated chasing the old broad and demanding her normal road roommate but knew it was a waste of time. “You better not snore.” Was all she could manage. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know I don’t, dear.” Rio said, thinking back to their time at the lakehouse. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The four hour bus ride felt extremely long as they traversed the long road around Lake Michigan. Peggy and Agatha were sitting next to each other while Rio sat with the pitchers in the back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you want to play neck, screw, or wed.” Rio leaned over the seats and asked them both. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha spun around, “Sure, why not?” Peggy sat up on her knees as well. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, neck, screw, or wed: Coach, Lilia, and…Mr. Wrigley.” Lupe proposed the first three victims. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ooooooh this one’s easy. Neck Coach, screw Mr. Wrigley, wed Lilia.” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What? You’d kiss the coach??” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not about to screw him or marry him, doll.” She replied to the laughter of the others. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I would go: neck the gum man, screw Lilia, wed Coach. I mean surely I’m not the only one who has imagined our chaperone is a real expert in the sack.” Peggy looked at them expectedly but everyone else stared at her in shock. “Well, guess that was just me then…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve got one: Bing Crosby, Clark Gable, and Cary Grant.” Wanda had overheard the game and wanted to join. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Neck Cary, screw Bing, wed Clark.” Rio said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why would you marry Clark? That man gets divorced more often than you get hits at bat.” Agatha cracked up at her joke. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The right answer is neck Clark, screw Cary, marry Bing.” Wanda said, “Haven’t you heard what they say about Cary Grant? Apparently he is very, very well-endowed.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How do you know that??” Peggy looked at her aghast. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Here’s a tough one, Angel. Wanda, Peggy, and Rio.” Lupe said with a sly smile. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha immediately blushed, “No way, that’s not fair.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Betty jumped in at this point, “Awww, come on! I’ll do it: neck Wanda, screw Rio, wed Peggy.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks, dear. I’d marry you too if given the choice.” Peggy reached out to grasp Betty’s hand. “Your turn, Agatha.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s just a game!” Wanda yelled.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine! Neck Peggy, screw Wanda, wed Rio.” She mumbled the words out so fast that everyone strained to hear her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wed who? Me?” Rio pointed to herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy and Wanda started humming the classic “here comes the bride” tune as Agatha sunk down in her seat to try to hide her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t want a diamond ring. I’d prefer jade, that’s my favorite gemstone, if you’re taking notes.” Rio peered over the seat and offered her preferences to her pretend fiancée. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Anything for you, sweetheart.” Agatha played along now as the other players started laughing at the acting. She sat back up and turned so she and Rio were facing each other over the seat. She reached forward to tuck a bit of Rio’s hair behind her ear.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And we’ll need to practice the wedding kiss beforehand. I don’t want you to embarrass yourself in front of our guests.” Rio was leaning into the fantasy and staring deeply into Agatha’s blue eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh hush, you know that won’t be a problem. I’ve never had stage fright before. I don’t choke under pressure.” Agatha gave her that signature wink that made Rio’s heart melt. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You two are so funny! You really sound like a real couple.” Betty was cracking up in her seat at the performance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, you could have fooled me!” Peggy said with a hint of sass. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After many more silly games, heated discussions, and gas station bathroom breaks, they pulled up to the Grand Rapids Plaza Hotel at 4pm. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Games in two hours so get ready in your rooms, then everyone better be back down here and ready to go at 5.” Coach Grant said as they filed off the bus and grabbed their keys from Lilia. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The rooms were run of the mill standard. Two twin beds, side tables, a dresser, and an ensuite. Agatha threw her suitcase down near the end of the bed she claimed closest to the door. Rio had stayed in the lobby to have a short meeting with the pitchers about tonight’s game. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laid down and stared at the unmoving ceiling fan. </span>
<em>
<span>God, it’s hot in here. </span>
</em>
<span>She stood to pull the cord on the fan but couldn’t find one. She stood on the bed but couldn’t see it anywhere. She searched the walls for a switch and none of them worked on the fan. She went to the window and pried it open, but there was no breeze. She could feel the sweat on her back already from just walking around the room. </span>
<em>
<span>This is going to be miserable. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She must have fallen asleep in the heat because the next thing she knew Rio was standing over telling her it was time to go. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The first game against the Chicks was uneventful. Coach decided to start the benchwarmers so Agatha and Rio both got a break. Even with their subs in the game, the Comets still won easily 4-0. They didn’t need the wins, but the team loved the competition. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After the game, back at the hotel, once the adrenaline of a game wore off, the players normally crashed. Unfortunately for both Agatha and Rio, riding the bench wasn’t the most strenuous or exciting activity. As they lay side by side in the sweltering room, neither could fall asleep. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t think I’ve ever been this hot before.” Agatha groaned, tossing to her side to try to find any comfortable position that might trick her body into letting her sleep. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why didn’t we ask someone to fix the fan?” Rio stood up on the bed and examined it like Agatha had done earlier. She also could not figure out how to turn it on. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you think it's dangerous to sleep in the bath? Will I drown in just a bit of water?” Agatha was so tempted by the prospect despite the obvious hazard. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hopped down off the bed and started ripping the top sheets of the bed, “Come on, I’ve got an idea. Grab your mattress and your pillow.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you doing?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ll see. Come on!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio folded the thin, flimsy mattress in half and grabbed her pillow and a sheet. She put it all under her arms and waited for Agatha to do the same. The clock on the wall read it was half past midnight. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The two players stepped out into the empty hall, and Rio led them to the stairwell. She held open the door with her back as Agatha followed and then they walked the four floors up to the rooftop. When Rio opened the door, which was luckily unlocked, the relief of the open air was immediate. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ahhhhh, god that’s better.” Agatha expressed softly as they carried their bedding to the middle of the roof. She watched Rio lay down her mattress in a clear patch of roof. “Wait, we’re not actually going to sleep up here, are we?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laid down and patted the ground next to her, “It beats dying of heatstroke in that hotel room, don’t you think?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked around. She could see the street lamps below lining the surrounding roads and a few building lights, but the night sky looked immense in comparison as it sat overtop of them. “You make a compelling argument.” She relented as she dropped her cargo and got down next to Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The two of them laid in silence for a long while. Agatha simply stared up at the stars above that looked extra bright and listened to the soft noises of a summer’s night in Michigan. She thought Rio must have fallen asleep after the amount of time that passed, so she jumped when the pitcher whispered her name, “Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She turned on her side to face her and saw Rio was staring right back, “I thought you drifted off.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t get enough of the view.” Rio said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re looking at me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I know.” Rio smirked and saw the way the compliment washed over Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, you sap.” The catcher gave Rio a weak shove to try to force her to look away but nothing could have forced her to change her gaze. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a heavy air sitting between their prone bodies. An unspoken tension. A delicate feeling of comfortable unease. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha?” Rio said her name again like a question. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t have to call for me. We’re the only two out here.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know, I know. I just…wanted to ask you something.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at Rio who seemed to be vibrating with anxiety in that moment, “Well? You can ask me anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can I kiss you?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The question launched into the night air like a firework. The whistling ascent lingering between them as the anticipation loomed. Agatha forced a swallow down her dry throat and looked at the intense brown eyes across from her. Rio was staring at her with a mix of adoration and a guarded sense of anticipatory disappointment, as if something bad might happen at any second. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t think about the question. She didn’t consider the implications, the morality of it all, the long-term consequence, or anything. She simply let her heart lead for the first time, and her heart wanted one thing alone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When their lips met, it was like the fuse on the firework had finally reached the end. The explosion was instant and fierce. Agatha wrapped one arm around Rio’s back and pulled them together. Rio opened her mouth gently and invited Agatha in. It was as hot as smoking gunpower as their mouths moved against each other in a frantic exchange.</span>
</p><p>
<span>All of the curious questions, the angry contests, the witty conversations. All the longing touches, the yearning stares, the joyful celebrations. The dazzling colors of their past rained down on them in sparkling glory in the quiet of the night. Every moment they shared coalesced into this single, perfect connection as the two women kissed with complete abandon. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt like she must have been shot off into heaven because Agatha’s soft lips were on hers. It was everything she had dreamed about for years. From the static magazine picture that she stared at to the hot-tempered real life version that pushed her to the dirt, it was everything and more. She felt the hands clawing at her back, and she moved her own to tangle in the brown locks that she so admired. Rio felt confidence rushing through her blood as she rolled them so that Agatha was now flat on her back and Rio was on top. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Those stunning blue eyes seemed otherworldly as they shined in the moonlight up at Rio. She paused for just a moment to look down at the beautiful woman below her. The sounds of their labored breathing was all they could hear before she dove back down and kissed Agatha again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was not at all like she imagined. Whereas the few other women she had kissed before were slow and gentle, soft and calm. Agatha was bold and passionate. She let her tongue wander freely and kissed like this was going to be their last. It was as competitive as the woman was on the field. She kissed like she wanted to win, like she wanted to prove she was the best kisser that Rio was ever going to kiss (and she knew it). </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was the first to pull back, shockingly, as she felt like her lungs were about to give out. She rolled off and lay beside Agatha for a moment, just trying to catch her breath, a permanent smile now plastered across her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Was that what you had in mind?” Agatha leaned on an elbow and looked down at her victim. She felt electric. Kissing Rio was a revelation. It was dangerous and sexy and sparked something in her that she had never felt before. She didn’t know whether it was the balmy summer heat or the aftermath of the kiss, but Agatha felt like she was on fire. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was speechless. It was like her soul had been sucked from her body. The way Agatha had so thoroughly consumed her should be studied in a lab. She dumbly nodded and prayed to a god she didn’t believe in that she would get the chance to do that again.</span>

<span>“Just like that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I put my fingers here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, slide them in gently.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you sure?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on, Rio, it’s not that hard. Tons of people do it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I’ve never done it before.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You just take three fingers, put them there, yup, see. Just like that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Where do I put my other hand?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Along the side.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, that feels good. Now what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now hold it steady and go try to knock down those pins!” Agatha pointed down the lane after showing Rio how to properly hold a bowling ball. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio walked down the slick wood-paneled floor and threw the ball with all her strength…right into the gutter. Agatha cracked up laughing in her seat as she watched the look of dejection when Rio turned around. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I’m glad we finally found one sport that you’re not a secret prodigy at!” She exclaimed as Rio sat down beside her and crossed her arms angrily. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They had the morning off before the next game, and Agatha had found a bowling alley not far from their hotel in Grand Rapids. They had woken up wrapped in each other’s arms as the sun started to rise over the rooftop where they spent the night. It was the closest to bliss that Agatha could ever remember feeling. The cool air, the endless pink and orange sky of daybreak, and the impossible softness of Rio’s body next to hers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Last night after their first and second (and third, fourth, fifth, and sixth) kisses, they had eventually succumbed to sleep. Agatha fought against the worry about what this meant when she woke up. </span>
<em>
<span>Are we dating now? What happens next? What have I done?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She instead leaned down and woke Rio with a tender peck on the lips. Agatha felt the lips below her spread wide into a smile and then earnestly kiss her back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought it was a dream.” Rio whispered against her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How’s the real thing in comparison?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Even better.” Rio dotted Agatha’s entire face with kisses.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now they were at the bowling alley after seeing today’s roster and realizing they were both riding the bench again. Agatha thought she couldn’t be more endeared to Rio, but seeing the pitcher pout with her bottom lip out after throwing a gutter ball may be the most adorable things she’d ever seen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Check me out.” She flipped her curls over a shoulder and grabbed the bright purple bowling ball. Agatha strutted up to their lane, focussed on the pins, and then stepped forward and rolled the ball. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched as the pins exploded and flew dramatically away until none were left standing. Her jaw dropped. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Guess you’re not the only one who can throw strikes.” Agatha stuck her tongue out teasingly as she celebrated her big score. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood up and stretched her neck side to side. She had never been bowling before. It was way too expensive to take eight kids to the alley when they were growing up, so she had a huge blind spot for this sport. It didn’t look hard; it was just rolling a heavy ball. She grabbed the black ball and held it like Agatha had shown her, took her stance, and rolled it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The ball barrelled down the lane before taking an unfortunate turn at the last second and only knocking down the very end pin. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hung her head and shuffled her feet back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Better luck next time, darling. I’m sure you’ll hit more on the next throw.” Agatha reached out and patted her shoulder. She desperately wanted to kiss that pouting lip but knew she couldn’t here in public. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They ended the ten frames with Rio on a disappointing score of 57 and Agatha hitting 175. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was terrible.” Rio grizzled as they returned their bowling shoes to the counter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now you know how normal people feel when playing against you. It’s not so fun to lose, now is it?” Agatha jested. She held open the door as they started walking back to the hotel. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio longed to hold Agatha’s hand as they walked together along the sidewalk. However, it wasn’t worth the stares and the questions. People tended to recognize them from the ball games. They couldn’t risk anything unsavory in the eyes of the managers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So…should we tell the front desk about the fan?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Already done. As much as I loved our little campout, I think I’d rather spend a night with you indoors.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh really?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded and wiggled her eyebrows at her teammate. She enjoyed seeing how much Rio was affected by every playful gesture or subtle move that she threw her way. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>At the game that night, Betty was the starting pitcher. She loved every opportunity to get out on the field and was getting better on the mound every day. Agatha and Rio took their spots on the bench next to each other. Billy came to sit next to Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How come you and Rio are in here with us again?” He asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Coach is giving other players some game time so they can get better.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you and Rio don’t need more time, because you’re already the best?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You said that, not me.” Agatha said as Rio held in a laugh. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you gonna come visit me in New Jersey?” He asked after they finished cheering for a great catch made by Dottie. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked down at his sad eyes, “Of course! New Jersey is not too far from Massachusetts. I can take a road trip and come visit you and Tommy and your mom. I can even bring Peggy too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about Rio?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The pitcher looked up at her name. She liked the company of the twins and was friendly with them but was still surprised to be included. She saw Agatha struggling so cut in, “I live way down at the bottom of the country in Florida. That would be a longgggg drive for me. Maybe I could take a plane ride some day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah! That would be so fun. I want to fly in the sky too, like Superman!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Very fun, now why don’t you go play with Toby.” Agatha tried to push him off the bench and distract him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“His name is Tommy! You’re so silly, Aunty Aggie.” Billy laughed at the old joke and ran off towards the other side of the dugout where Tommy was reading a comic. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you going back to Florida when the season ends?” Agatha asked now that they were alone. They hadn’t discussed their future plans yet. She hated the thought of being so far away from Rio when they had just started…whatever this was. They only had a few weeks left before the season ended and everyone went their separate ways. She had to go back to her factory job in Salem and check in on her house and her mother. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I need to see my family and friends. Aren’t you going home too?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Unfortunately I must.” Agatha said, “I hate the off season.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We still have a championship to win. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.” Rio warned. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you think…we could see each other over the break?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Definitely. I’ve been able to save a lot of money. I bet I could actually afford a plane ticket. If you’ll have me.” Rio was already giddy at the idea of flying for the first time and more specifically, flying to see Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The catcher smiled shyly, “I’ve got a lot to show you. My house, my local ball club. I want to take you to my favorite breakfast spot. There’s all the Salem Witch sites, if you like that history.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’d be amazing. I love learning new things. I’m looking forward to it already.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Suddenly the prospect of the off season didn’t seem so bad anymore. They watched the rest of the game and cheered on the team to another victory. In the locker room, Peggy hung back with Agatha as the rest of the team took off to get a late dinner or hit the dance hall. The two of them walked together back to the hotel. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How was your first night without me?” Peggy questioned. They had roomed together consistently for the past five years. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ran through the past 24 hours in her mind. It was unimaginable what had happened in that short period of time. Her entire world had shifted overnight. How could she possibly describe that to someone?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was good.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s it??” Peggy was aghast. “That’s all I get?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t hold it in any longer, “We kissed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“EEEEEEE!!” Peggy squealed and jumped up in the air. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shhhhhhh! Shut up!” Agatha tried to cover her friend’s mouth to not draw attention. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You had your first kiss in </span>
<em>
<span>years </span>
</em>
<span>and you’re only telling me now? What the hell? Details, now!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not one to kiss and tell.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, come on! I give you all the ratings and details of my trysts.” Peggy was dying to know more. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was secretly desperate to tell somebody about it and threw caution to the wind, “Fine - It was 10/10. I didn’t know kissing could be so damn good. I guess I should be thanking you because I wouldn’t have ever given this a chance if you hadn’t pushed me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ha! You’re welcome. I knew you two had something. So what was it like…kissing a woman?” Peggy had lowered her volume to ensure nobody overheard. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“God, it really was different. Better. So much better. There was none of the unwelcome dominance or sloppy uncoordinated movements. She was so sure of herself, so skilled. It was like a perfect match up, a give and a take. Not just give, give, give. I can’t believe I’ve never done it before.” Agatha felt herself getting heated just retelling it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow, you’re making me jealous. Maybe I should give Rio a try.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t.” Agatha snapped back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ooooh, sorry babe. Didn’t know you had claimed her all for yourself.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know what I want now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Took you long enough.” Peggy said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Back in the hotel room, which was thankfully much cooler thanks to the circulating fan, Agatha got ready for bed. Rio was still out. She had gone out for a late dinner with the other pitchers. Agatha hated to say that she missed her already. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Thankfully she didn’t have to wait long. She was reading the sports section of the paper in bed when she heard the door open and saw Rio’s face break into a smile. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey.” The pitcher said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hi there.” Agatha closed the paper and tossed it to the floor. She threw back the comforter and crooked a finger to beckon Rio over. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes widened at the suggestive request, and she quickly dropped the gear bag slung over her shoulder, slipped off her shoes, and started stripping off her clothing as if her garments were on fire.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eager?” Agatha suggested as Rio fumbled with the zip on her skirt. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve been waiting all day for this.” Rio said after finally freeing herself of her bottoms and was left standing in just a white satin bra and lace tap pants. Agatha licked her lips, and watched Rio slowly climb into the twin bed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Ever since their kiss last night, it was like the floodgates had opened. Rio was desperate for more. They hadn’t discussed anything. She didn’t want to complicate it with cruel reality just yet. All she wanted was Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Their bodies were pressed tightly as Rio readjusted so they were facing each other, side by side. Agatha ran her hand along Rio’s cheek and jaw, admiring her big brown eyes and trying to memorize every pore of the face in front of her. The distinct shape of the tip of her nose, the soft lines beside her mouth, the alluring curve of her lips. She couldn’t resist leaning in and capturing those lips again in another passionate kiss. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio moaned into her and opened her mouth to let Agatha in further. Letting her explore every inch of her. Their tongues danced together as they searched each other’s mouths for further evidence of their longing. It was intoxicating, and Agatha felt drunk off the feeling. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She let her hands wander and roam along Rio’s back. She ran into her bra strap and without thinking, unhooked it gently. As the fabric fell between them, she felt her breath hitch at the sudden new discovery. She remembered seeing Rio’s chest before but having the chance to touch it was an entirely different thing. Agatha brought a hand up and ghosted it over one breast, tracing the soft curve and delighting in the feeling. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched Agatha’s face and loved seeing her experience something new. She dipped her head and kissed Agatha’s neck, gently sucking and nipping her pulse point, which spurred Agatha on to fully palm at the breast in her hand and then squeeze the nipple that was between her two fingers. Rio whined out pathetically as the feeling of sharp, pleasurable pain shot right to her core. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha…you’re driving me crazy.” She keened out against the skin beneath her lover’s ear. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took that as a challenge and grinned as she moved down and started kissing from Rio’s neck down to her collarbone, and agonizingly slowly down her chest. Rio laid back fully on the bed and moved her hands to the back of Agatha’s head as the catcher sucked sensually at her breasts. Agatha threw a leg over Rio’s waist so she was laying fully on top of her and alternated between each of Rio’s nipples, trying to give adequate attention to both. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She chased the beautiful noises that came from Rio’s mouth and tried to learn exactly what she liked. She seemed to enjoy it rough and let out the most sensational moans when Agatha used her teeth. Rio’s hips started moving subtly at first, and Agatha could feel her squirming beneath her. Then, it became more obvious as Rio was desperately seeking any sort of friction. Agatha decided to snake a hand down between them and…</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Knock, Knock </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck. Shit. Fuck.” Rio shot up out of the bed and scanned the floor for a shirt to throw on. Agatha tumbled to her feet and quickly threw Rio’s discarded bra towards her suitcase. She smiled to herself at hearing those curse words fall from Rio’s panicked mouth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She pulled down the sheets on the other bed to make it seem like they had been sleeping separately and called out, “Just a minute!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was haphazardly buttoning up her sleep shirt, still cursing under her breath at the interruption. Agatha tossed her the sleep shorts and checked over the room once more to make sure it all looked presentable. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hurry up!” Agatha whispered harshly as she ran her fingers through her hair and moved towards the door. She looked back and saw Rio give her the thumbs up before unlocking the door and opening it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Their chaperone, Lilia, was standing there, “It’s not polite to make a guest wait at the door for so long.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry, I was just getting out of the shower. Is everything alright?” Agatha asked. They very rarely saw Lilia after hours. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia eyed her, clearly not believing the lie but not caring enough to question it, “Apologies for the last minute visit, but Lupe was meant to start tomorrow and is currently vomiting in her room. I wanted to see if Rio is willing to step in for the next game?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio overheard the question and walked over to the door, “Yes, of course. That would be no problem at all.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia nodded, “Great, I’ll let Coach know. Have a good night. Oh…and your buttons are mismatched.” She pointed to Rio’s shirt which was hanging crookedly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha quickly shut the door and glared at Rio, “What the hell?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio cringed and looked down at her shirt, which looked like she had tried to dress in the dark, “I was trying to move fast! Not my fault, my mind was still caught up in other things.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was close. Too close. I don't think Lilia would say anything but if that had been one of the other gals or the coach…” Agatha felt the panic rising in her throat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She sat down on her bed and fussed with her hands. Everything felt overwhelming as she thought about what they were doing. It shouldn’t feel this good if it was so wrong. Agatha grabbed her hair and ran her fingers along her scalp to try to calm down. Rio came and sat beside her and started to gently rub her back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s alright. We’ll take it slow. I don’t want to make you feel uncomfortable.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I don’t! It’s just…what if someone catches us? What if someone finds out? What then? I don’t think I could handle that.” Agatha confessed. She couldn’t imagine how people would look at her if they knew. They would likely burn her at the stake, for all she knew. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ll be more careful. I’m sorry. I was just excited, so excited. You’re so…beautiful. I want to be around you all the time.” Rio put an arm around Agatha’s shoulder and placed a soft kiss on her temple. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“God, when you keep speaking like that you make it hard to resist.” Agatha brought her hand up and pulled Rio in for a searing kiss. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She pulled back after a few seconds, “Wait, you made me forget! We’re meant to be slowing things down.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry! I can’t help it. Fine, let’s just lay down. As long as I can fall asleep with you in my arms, I’ll behave.” Rio relaxed back and welcomed Agatha beside her. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>The team finished off the series against the Chicks with two more wins. It was a perfect ending to the regular season and a great way to go into the playoffs.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After getting back to Kenosha, Rio said her goodbyes to the team and stopped by the ballpark payphone before heading home. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jen?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s up, rookie?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s happening.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s happening?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh no, Rio. What were you thinking?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why can’t you just be happy for me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because I know how these things end.” Jen sighed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s still early. We haven’t even…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t want to know! You know the risks. Be careful. Don’t become careless. I know how you get.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, yeah. Are you gonna come to the finals when we make it? I can send you money for a ticket.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You better make it there first. Don’t get too distracted with your new sweetheart or whatever. I want to go on a train, so don’t blow this.” Jen snarked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You doubt me? Anyway, I need to head home to rest. We’ve got an early practice in the morning then our first game is in three days. Wish me luck.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good luck.” Jen hung up the phone and whispered to herself as she walked away, “she’s gonna need it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The first game of the playoffs was on Thursday, September 2nd. The Comets were facing off against the Racine Belles in a best of five battle. The other match-up was between the second place Blue Sox and the third place Peaches. Winner of both series would meet in the finals. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s head was all over the place. She was basking in the glory of the nights she had spent with Rio alone but also felt like she wanted to push the panic button and abort it all. The close call with Lilia had scared the hell out of her and forced her to remember why this was so risky. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When they were together, it felt like they were in another world. A better place where their love wasn’t taboo. But that was a fantasy. The world they lived in was not accepting of two women together. This world held an unending cruelty for people that were different from the norm. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laid in her bed before the first game and felt her contradicting thoughts battling each other. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I need to put an end to this</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>No, it just started! </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Well it needs to end. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Please, I need more time with her. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I can’t do this. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I’ll keep it a secret. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>No I won’t. I don’t want to. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio is the first person I’ve ever felt this way about…maybe ever. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Ugh, but I know that we can’t actually be together. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Why not? Why can’t I be with her?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>It’s not allowed. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>We could figure something out. I want to be with her. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I’ll be giving up marriage, kids, and a normal life. I’ll have to hide this forever. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha put her pillow over her head and tried to sleep. Having racing thoughts was draining the life out of her. They had a game to play. She needed to push this aside for now. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Welcome to the postseason, ladies. The playoffs start now. Let’s start on the right foot and come out the gate swinging. We’ve got home field advantage for the series, and you know our fans in town would love to see us win tonight. So keep your heads in the game. Forget whatever is going on in your personal lives. Nothing else matters except this game, right here, right now.” Coach Grant was brimming with excitement. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stepped forward next as the team’s de facto captain, “I just want to say that I’m so proud of everyone on this team. I feel so lucky to be a Comet and to be playing with all of you. I know I’m not the easiest to get along with, but this team is like a family to me. That’s a hard word for me - family. I didn’t grow up with a good one and the one I tried to build fell apart, so you gals are all I have. And I couldn’t be more grateful.” She took a deep breath and pushed on. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know most people might say win or lose, we’ll still be friends. But I’m not most people. If we don’t win this, so help me god. You better pray I don’t see you on the streets.” The team broke out in laughter that broke the budding tension in the room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wasn’t kidding!” Agatha called out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks Angel. Very inspiring. Alright, let’s get out there and show them what we’re made of!” Coach clapped his hands together as the team ran out to the dugout. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The stands were packed as the teams took the field for the national anthem. Agatha scanned the crowd and took in all faces - the neighbors she’d lived next to for years, the people she saw regularly at the diner, and the curious out-of-towners checking out their first women’s baseball game. She smiled at the children who were excitedly waving at the players, trying to get any semblance of acknowledgement. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The announcer’s voice came through the speakers, “Welcome to the first game of five against the Racine Belles. It all comes down to this, folks. One last battle before the final. Let’s give it up for the hometown girls - your Kenosha Comets!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The team jogged out onto the field to a wave of applause. They all lined up along the base path for the national anthem. Agatha and Rio stood side by side as they waited for the song to begin. It was incredibly subtle, but Agatha could swear she could feel something brushing her left hand. She looked out of her peripherals, but Rio was staring out into the stands like everyone else. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then she felt it again. The smallest touch against her pinky from Rio’s. Agatha fought against the grin as this wasn’t the time to smile like a love-struck teenager. Given the recent war, the national anthem was a moment of patriotic reflection. It was not a moment for butterflies and goosebumps and embarrassing feelings. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Luckily she was saved when the first notes started and Rio’s right hand went to her chest. Agatha had to try to conjure memories of her awful mother in order to drown out the inappropriate thoughts that started to pop up at the thought of Rio’s chest. When the announcer finally called out “Play Ball!”, she shot the pitcher a dirty look for daring to make her feel such things. Rio simply smiled her innocent toothy grin that made Agatha swoon further. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Comets were in the field first, and Rio was starting on the mound. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ready?” Agatha gripped her mask in one hand and her glove in the other as they made the familiar walk out together to start the game. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t worry about me, sweets. Are you ready?” Rio asked as she adjusted her cap. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ha, I was born for this. Let’s show the Belles who they’re dealing with.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched with wonder as Rio struck out the first two batters with ease. Three pitches each. Bam, bam, bam. She was a phenom. She was a baseball god. Agatha was in so much trouble. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The third batter was thrown out at first to retire the side. The Comets were up to bat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You keep pitching like that, Rio, and we’re going to be home early tonight!” Wanda commented as they all sat on the bench in the dugout. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll do my best, Red.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dottie was leading off against the Belle’s pitcher, Maeve O’Connell, who everyone called “Irish” due to her heritage. She had a blazing cutter that required a wish and prayer to hit, but her fastball and curveball were nothing to write home about. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The inning finished with two runners left on base as the Belles made several great catches in a row. The next few innings were much of the same. Agatha hit a great double but couldn’t score as Fossey struck out right after her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>In the fifth inning, Rio called time after the first out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pushed up her mask and jogged over to the pitching mound, “Are you alright? What’s going on?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio held her glove up to cover her mouth and leaned in close, “Do you want to go out tonight?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you kidding?” Agatha stared at the audacious pitcher, trying to keep her voice low and in control, “Did you just pause this game to ask me out?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You love it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, this is ridiculous. You can’t do this.” Agatha looked around at all the players waiting for them, at all the fans staring down at their supposedly game-stopping, important conversation. She wanted to say she hated it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just tell me you’ll go out with me, and we can finish this game.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyebrows shot up, “No?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You can’t hold this game hostage just to force my hand.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m the pitcher, babe. I control this game.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head. She could feel the impatience of the collective growing around them, but Rio wasn’t budging. “You literally could have just asked me in the dugout. We only need two more outs.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s not nearly as fun.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine. We’ll leave together after.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can’t wait.” Rio turned and started getting set again as if that hadn’t just happened, as if she didn’t just waste a few minutes of the semi-finals in front of thousands of paying fans. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha seethed inside but quickly walked back to home plate to finish the inning. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What was that meeting about?” Coach Grant stopped them both as they walked off the field. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha said nothing and looked to Rio to answer. She shrugged nonchalantly, “Just clarifying the gameplan for the next few batters. My arm’s been a little sore, so I wanted to lay off the fastball.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Coach looked at them suspiciously but couldn’t confirm or deny the claim, “Right…well, don’t make it a habit. The ump will be on me if you waste time again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Won’t happen again.” Rio said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As they sat down beside each other, Agatha said out of the side of her mouth, “Should I worry about how good of a liar you are?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’d never lie to you, baby.” Rio whispered back with a chuckle. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy singled in the eighth inning and Agatha was able to send her home to put the Comets ahead. This started an offensive hitting streak as the team put up another three runs to jet off to a solid lead. The Belles got one run at the top of the ninth, but it wasn’t enough and the game finished with that final out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“One game down. Just two more wins and we’re going to the finals! Rest up, and I’ll see you back here tomorrow.” Coach Grant was ecstatic with the win. He was just as invested as the rest of them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ready to go?” Peggy nodded to the exit as Agatha finished dressing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, sorry, Peg. I’m going out with Rio tonight.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Since when?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Since…” Agatha paused. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No…is that what that time out was about?” Peggy’s jaw dropped as she saw the bashful look on her friend’s face. “Wow, I knew she liked you. But she really likes you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Keep the window cracked in case I get back late.” Agatha said. Pearl was known to lock and bolt the doors after curfew at 11pm on game nights, per the league instructions. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do.” Peggy warned with a smile before leaving with some of the other girls. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha left her bag in her locker and wandered over to Rio, who was slipping on her Mary Janes, “Where are we going anyway? Nothing's open this late on a weekday.” It was just past 8:30pm. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ll see.” Rio stashed her bag as well and led the way out onto the street. Agatha hop stepped to catch up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was quiet outside as they walked side by side along the sidewalk on 7th Avenue. They didn’t speak much as both were still processing the game and otherwise lost in their own thoughts. It was about five minutes before Rio took a turn into a gate. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, where are you going?” Agatha looked around the empty streets before following. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on!” Rio gestured her over. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We can’t be in here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why not?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moved her hands wildly around to their surroundings, “This is a graveyard!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And? Why can’t the living enjoy it too?” Rio kept walking along the tree-lined path. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed but followed, “Why here? It’s creepy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s secluded. Nobody will bother us here. The groundskeeper and gravedigger don’t come around until midnight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How do you know that? On second thought, I don’t want to know how.” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s just a big park. Sometimes I come here after a game to just sit and think. It’s loud sometimes at the house. And the quiet is nice. I never got much quiet back home either.” Rio sat down on one of the many benches. Agatha sat down too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They sat and listened to the sounds of the cemetery - the subtle whoosh of the wind, the chirping of a few crickets, the engines of passing cars. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay enough silence. I don’t like just sitting with my thoughts. Why did you ask me here?” Agatha was not one to enjoy silent reflection. She didn’t enjoy the places her mind took her when left to their own devices. It reminded her too much of those awful months after Nicky passed and Ralph left, when she sat alone in her home bathing in misery. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I like you. I like spending time with you.” Rio reached out and took Agatha’s hand. It brought her back to this moment. “I like being somewhere where I can hold your hand without worrying about who might see.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How do you do that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You always know just what to say to make me feel special.” Agatha admitted.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are special. Sorry that nobody has made you feel like that before.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked around but could only see headstones and flowers in every direction. It should have made her break. It had taken months for her to visit Nicky's grave - the pain was so all-consuming. It should have been hard, but instead this was the easiest thing she'd ever done. Reassured by the lack of living presence, she leaned in and kissed Rio gently. It was a quiet kiss. No burning passion or agonizing want. It was a kiss that tied the knot on their connection and declared something about their relationship. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Despite the grim setting and surrounding image of death and despair, their world was colored and alive. </span>
</p><p>
<span>This was the kiss that made it real. </span>

<span>“The first time I put that uniform on, I cried . . . because it was never a dream to become a professional ball player. The dream was to survive, the dream was to do the best you can in whatever you do. It was like winning. This was my own kind of winning. I kind of stood there for a little bit after I was dressed and I said, ‘Ah, this is it, this is it!’ and I never forgot that.”</span>
</p>

<span>The Belles won game two to tie things up, but the Comets fought back to win game three. Game four was at Racine’s home ground. The Comets just needed one more win to earn their spot in the championship game. One more win to make it all worth it. Nobody wanted to go home empty handed now. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The betting pool at the bar is almost up to $400!” Gertie exclaimed to the table. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Pearl scooped up a large portion of mashed potatoes and splattered it onto her plate, “Now who in their right mind is putting that much money on a baseball game?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Half the town has a few bucks on the Comets to win. I swear I saw Father McDonald throw a dollar into the box.” Gertie said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t be ridiculous.” Pearl admonished her friend. “What is the world coming to?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t think we can win it, Pearl?” Peggy asked as she cut into her pork chop. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Now I never said that, dear.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We only need to win one more to get there. Then it’s one last five-game series. The Peaches are currently leading their series against the Blue Sox.” Agatha explained. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wouldn’t mind going against the Peaches in the finals. The Blue Sox, on the hand, I don’t know. When they’re in the zone, some of those gals can really hit.” Peggy said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve got two bucks on the Peaches winning their match-up.” Gertie added, while ignoring the disapproving glare from Pearl. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How much do you have on us?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ten dollars for winning the semis. And then I put another twenty on the finals.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thirty dollars!” Pearl was shocked. “You better not be short on your portion of the rent this month.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh hush. I never spend money, and I believe in the Comets. Any team with Peggy and Agatha is a shoe-in to win it all.” </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>It was the night of game four. They were gathered in the dugout an hour before game time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?” Coach looked at the pitcher at the end of the bench. “I know you’re meant to be off one more day, but we could end this tonight. Can I start you?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was itching to get into the game, “Yes, I’m ready.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s what I like to hear. I’ve switched Little Red and Fossey in the line up. We need to be able to capitalize when Agatha gets on base. Remember to stay focussed. Have fun. And let’s win this thing!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio and Agatha went to the practice mound to get ready. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did this mess up your plans?” Rio asked, knowing how meticulously Agatha liked to prepare before each game based on the starting pitcher. She had probably written out each of Lupe’s pitches and planned the calls for every batter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The catcher chuckled, “I know you well enough at this point. I don’t need to prepare for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What if I surprise you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’d love to see you try.” Agatha grinned and crouched down, pounding her glove to loosen the leather. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sauntered over to the pitching rubber and started her stretches. The fans were slowly starting to make their way into the ballpark. Agatha loved this time. The growing swell of excitement. The increasing pressure. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The anticipation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio threw her entire arsenal of pitches. Agatha knew them all by heart. They practiced different placements and varied the order. It was so easy between them. Agatha felt like she could read Rio’s mind at times. They were so in sync that it felt like nothing could stop them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>For the first three innings, that was exactly the case. Rio was a woman on a mission. Agatha had never seen her so intensely driven before. Every pitch was exact, every fastball hammered her mitt, every curveball broke with impossible drop. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was glowing with joy. Each strikeout seemed to only fuel her further. Agatha was hypnotized. She was so beautiful. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I want to look at that face forever.  </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The Comets hadn’t scored yet. Wanda came close with a long ball hit to the warning track. They all thought it was going over, but it banged right on the top of the fence and fell back in the park. She was able to get a double at least. The Belles were doing a great job of holding off the runs, so the scoreboard remained all zeroes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>In the fifth inning, Agatha squared up on a low fastball and smacked a ball clear of the fences for a solo home-run. “Wave goodbye folks because that ball is long gone!” screamed the announcer as the Racine crowd groaned out in dismay. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha jogged around the bases and revelled in the frustration from the opposing team and their fans. She tapped home plate and pointed up to the sky, her typical celebration - a sendup to Nicky, a small acknowledgement of her own angel. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nice one, Harkness.” Buckets nodded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Another one for the books, Angel.” Coach tipped his cap - the admiration clear in his eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Save some for the rest of us.” Rio joked as Agatha took the spot next to her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s plenty to go around. That pitcher’s serving them up on a platter.” Agatha shrugged. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stayed relentless when the Comets were in the field. Agatha tried to keep the pace even to give her enough time to reset after each pitch and each batter. She didn’t want to tire Rio out now. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was on track for a perfect game. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It’s every pitcher’s elusive goal. An almost unattainable and completely implausible target. A white whale. A needle in a haystack.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A perfect game is when a pitcher pitches a complete game (nine innings) without allowing a single batter to reach a base. No hits, no walks, no errors. Everything has to go perfectly, hence the name. It takes a whole lot of skill but an even bigger amount of luck.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In 1948, in Major League Baseball, there had only been five perfect games ever recorded. Perhaps most famously by Cy Young in 1904, who is often regarded as one of the greatest pitchers of all time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As the game ticked into the eighth inning, Shirley looked at the scoresheet, “Hey Rio, you’ve gotten no hits so far!  Do you think- HEY!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had chucked her heavy mitt at Shirley, “Shhhh! Don’t say it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy and Tommy burst out laughing. Shirley was rubbing her calf where the mitt had hit her, “What??”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy laughed, “They say it’s bad luck to bring up…you know what. If a pitcher’s getting close, it could blow their concentration.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How was I meant to know?” Shirley cried out, pretending to limp out to the field. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was oblivious to the commotion. She knew. How could she not? Rio knew everything that went on on her field when she was in charge. She knew how many pitches she had thrown. She knew that there were no hits. She knew who was up next. She knew it all. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ready?” Rio asked Agatha who was fetching her thrown glove. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s do this.” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The shortstop was up, Patty Reed. What she lacked in height, she made up for in tenacity and speed. Agatha knew her batting average, .210, and her preferences, inside fastballs. She called for a curveball. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Strike.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes flared with excitement, and Agatha bit back her smile. She called for a fastball. Rio leaned forward, rocked back, hands over her head, leg kicked out, and as her arm came around the ball left her fingers at exactly the right spot. Agatha watched it speed towards them. Patty’s bat swung around. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It connected. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha jumped up and watched the ball soar towards center field. </span>
<em>
<span>Come on, come on. </span>
</em>
<span>Buckets was sprinting for it. She ran hard and dove forward into the grass with her glove extended. As the center fielder rose, she waved her glove in the air and the ball was securely in it. The batter was out! </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What a catch from Loretta “Buckets” Buckley! She keeps the hopes of a perfect game alive!” The announcer called. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha released the breath she had been holding. Relief flooding through her, though short-lived, as they had to get ready for the next batter immediately. Rio shook off a call for a changeup, wanting another fastball, wanting to make up for that last pitch. Agatha knew it was risky but could see from Rio’s expression that she needed to do it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Strike.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Two more strikes came in right after for the second out. Rio nodded to herself as the batter walked away, a silent affirmation. Agatha felt the pressure growing. The crowd was watching each pitch now with bated breath. The Belles’ catcher was up next. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rubbed her hand against her skirt. Even in the evening, it was still in the 70s and warm for a night game. The pitcher adjusted her cap nervously. Agatha could see the uncertainty for the first time in those big brown eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Time out.” She turned to the umpire, who nodded and paused the game. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took her time and walked over to the pitcher’s mound. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hi.” Rio said back quietly. Agatha was not used to this timidness in her pitcher. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re doing great.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I almost messed it all up.” Rio dropped her head and kicked the dirt. She was still stuck on that near hit from Patty. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey.” Agatha waited until Rio’s eyes met hers again, “I don’t care about a perfect game.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought you weren’t meant to say it aloud.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just want to win. I don’t care how we win. I don’t care if you bean every single batter on this team. As long as we score more runs at the end of it, I don’t care what happens in the meantime.” Agatha said. There was a momentary pause as those words settled between them. Rio’s eyebrows knitted down as if she landed on a decision. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want it.” Rio stared down at the baseball in her throwing hand. She marvelled at its simplicity and turned it around in her palm. “I want to throw a perfect game.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled. She knew Rio wanted it and truthfully she wanted it too. If it took her pretending she didn’t for Rio to admit that she did, then so be it. “Then let’s do it. Together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Together.” Rio agreed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The batter hit a foul ball straight up in the air behind home on the first pitch, having mistimed the off speed curve. Agatha was blinded by the bright lights but finally saw the ball as it was coming down and caught it against the backstop to end the inning. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda and Dottie both got on a base at the top of the ninth. Horsey sent Wanda home to put the Comets up 2-0, then Peggy bunted Dottie in for another run and put them up by three. The Belles were then up to close it out. Rio just needed three more outs to secure her spot in history. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s just you and me, okay? Forget everything else. It’s just us.” Agatha counselled the pitcher as they walked out for the last time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio steadied herself. She tried to quiet the sounds of the stands as the crowd jeered the Comets and attempted to cheer on the home team. If the Belles lost, they would be eliminated from the tournament. She looked at the catcher, and everything else disappeared. Those blue eyes offered comfort, motivation, and heat. Rio felt her pulse pounding in her neck. She saw the sign - fastball. They were just playing catch. Agatha and Rio. Nobody else. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She threw it as hard as she could. The motion was a part of her body. It was second nature. She didn’t even hear the umpire’s call. She knew it was a strike as she watched the batter swing and miss. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand throbbed at the impact. That had to be the fastest pitch she’d ever caught. Her mitt felt branded by Rio’s pitch. </span>
<em>
<span>Oh, we’re winning this. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She called for another fastball and watched it zip past the batter again like it was a blur. Rio was throwing like her life depended on it. The third fastball hit her glove with a satisfying thump. “Strike three, you’re out!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Two more outs was all that stood between Rio and eternal glory. The nerves were gone now. Agatha would never admit that she loved the cocky swagger that took over the pitcher’s body now. She looked invincible. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Joyce Winter, the third baseman, was up. Rio didn’t even seem to register the change in batter. She was in her own world. The first pitch was extremely close, right on the upper corner of the zone, but the ump called it a ball. Agatha watched Rio’s nose scrunch up in annoyance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The next pitch was a slow knuckleball. Joyce had anticipated a fastball and swung entirely too early, leaving her spinning and embarrassed for a strike. Agatha heard the grunt of anger from the batter as she dug into the box and reset her stance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The fastball came in low, but Joyce swung anyway and somehow got a piece of it. The grounder slid across the infield right into Peggy’s glove. She whipped it over to Dottie for an easy out number two. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“26 in a row have been retired, and it all comes down to this. One final out is all she needs. Rio Vidal is one out away from writing her name in the history books.” The announcer painted the picture. </span>
</p><p>
<span>All the hopes and dreams of the Belles rested on the rookie Irene Lee’s shoulders. The kid couldn’t have been more than 18 years old, and Agatha almost felt bad for the teen. She saw the batter’s knees shaking beneath the hem of the skirt and figured it was best to just put her out of her misery. Agatha called for Rio’s signature fastball. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Strike.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Strike.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Strike.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>On the final call, time seemed to stand still for one brief moment as Agatha and Rio stared at each other in disbelief. Rio did it. They did it together. Agatha watched the smile overwhelm the pitcher’s stunned face and then the pandemonium began. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Reaper has done it! A perfect game! Rio Vidal has thrown a perfect game! The Comets are going to the championship!” The announcer was going crazy on the mic. Even though the Belles fans were sad about the loss, they were cheering for this pitching achievement. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio fell to her knees and looked to the sky, “Mami and Papi…that was for you.” She whispered quietly to herself as her eyes filled with tears. She opened her arms wide as Agatha rushed towards her. They fell together to the ground in a beautiful embrace as the rest of the team dogpiled the pair.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Way to go, Rio!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You did it, I can’t believe you did it!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re going to the finals!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was unbelievable!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Everyone was shouting and yelling around them, but all Rio could feel was Agatha’s body latched onto hers. She couldn’t process the enormity of what had just happened. It was all too much. Everything she had worked for, everything she had dreamed about, she had done it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Congratulations, my love.” She murmured into Agatha’s ear. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t hear a response as the noise was deafening, but she felt the catcher’s arms wrap even tighter around her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>In the locker room after they finally cleared the field, Coach Grant addressed the group, “We’ve actually done it. We’ve made it. One last series that’s all that stands between us and the trophy. And we got there thanks to the best damn pitching I’ve seen in my life.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a bow as the team all whooped and patted her on the back again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There are four days until the next game. It will be on Thursday night in Kenosha, got it? Enjoy tomorrow off then we’re practicing every afternoon. Stay focussed, stay fit, and let’s bring this home!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Everyone was buzzing with excitement. After the coach and Lilia left the room, Peggy pulled out a bottle of vodka and passed it around. Each took a swig besides Shirley, who never drank. Agatha felt the pleasant burn in her throat after her drink. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The Racine dancehall is open until midnight. Let’s go!” Peggy yelled. She was always the reveller, always the leader of festivity and fun. The group got changed and piled into the various cars to get there. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was still sitting on the bench in her uniform. Agatha hung back as the remaining team members filed out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio? Are you alright?” Agatha asked. The pitcher was staring at her glove. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked up and smiled, “Yeah. I’m just still taking it all in. I can’t believe this is my life.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pretty good, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Better than good.” Rio stood and reached out for Agatha. Her hands found the catcher’s face and she pulled her in for a kiss. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“OH! I’m sorry! I…” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned quickly to see a flash of scarlet hair as the door banged shut. Rio’s mouth dropped open in shock as they looked at each other unsure what to do. Agatha took off and ran out the door. She saw Wanda shuffling down the hall quickly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wanda, wait!” She called out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s fine, Angel. It’s fine. I’ll see you later.” Wanda shouted out, without turning around and all but ran out of the ballpark. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stopped and stood in the hallway alone. </span>
<em>
<span>This is bad. What if she tells someone? No, Wanda wouldn’t do that…would she?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio appeared beside her, “I wasn’t thinking. I’m sorry.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s just go. It’ll be alright.” </span>
<em>
<span>I hope. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>In the parking lot, Peggy was waiting. “Where’ve you two been?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry, Rio was still basking in her perfect game. We’re ready.” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re riding with Horsey. Come on!” Peggy opened the car door and ushered them in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As they pulled out, Agatha asked, “Is Wanda coming?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nah, she said she had to drive the twins home. She looked sick. I hope she’s okay.” Peggy said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and Rio shared a look of fear. Maybe the redhead wasn’t feeling well. Maybe it was unrelated. Maybe she wasn’t about to rat them out to the league. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why do you guys look like someone died? We just won our series! We’re going to actually play in the big game! Let’s celebrate!” Peggy tried to lift the mood. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha reached across the backseat and grabbed the bottle of liquor from Peggy’s lap and chugged the remaining amount. “You’re right, Peg. We deserve this!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The dancehall was bustling and the team received a huge round of applause when they walked in. It seemed like most of the patrons had been at the game that night. Rio, in particular, was the immediate object of attention as men flocked to her to buy her drink or grab a dance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was not used to the fame but seemed to be enjoying it. People were asking for her autograph and bombarding her with questions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ordered another drink at the bar and swayed to the music with Dottie and Helen. Peggy was already dancing with a handsome, young man that had pulled her onto the floor as soon as they stepped inside. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was soon out spinning with her own fella, and Agatha forced herself not to watch. All she wanted was to be that guy. To be able to dance with Rio in public. To be able to hold her close without any judgement. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I need to powder my nose.” She said to the girls and huffed away to the ladies’ room. There were already several women at the sinks, primping and priming their faces and hair. Agatha took a spot when it opened up and reapplied her red lipstick. She stared in the mirror and tried to shake off the worry. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>She’s just dancing with that guy to be polite. Rio likes me. She doesn’t like him. She can’t dance with me here. She likes me. She likes me. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Some of us are waiting.” A shrill voice called out behind her. Agatha glared at the impatient girl tapping a foot behind her and walked out before biting back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had rejoined the teammates, who were all excitedly recounting the game. The pitcher immediately lit up when Agatha walked up to the circle, “I couldn’t have done it without my catcher. She made all the right calls.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt herself blush deeply, “Don’t be modest. It was mostly you, superstar.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ugh, we get it. You’re both incredible. Don’t forget all of us from way up on your pedestal together.” Dottie snarked and the group laughed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It wouldn’t have been a perfect game without everyone’s help. I mean it. Some of those plays were amazing, and without that, none of this would have happened. So, cheers to the team. Cheers to the championship!” Rio raised her glass and everyone followed as they clinked their glasses and downed their drinks. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When the night finally wound down and the jukebox played the last tune, Peggy walked over to Agatha with a mischievous look on her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve got a surprise for you.” She said with her hands behind her back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha braced herself, “Do I wanna know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy pulled out a motel room key and dangled it in front of her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You…want to stay in Racine tonight?” Agatha looked at it suspiciously. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not me. I’m going home with that one.” Peggy pointed to a towering, dark-haired man leaning against the bar. “I had booked a room at the Sleeper Motel but won’t be needing it anymore. So…feel free to take it, along with whoever else you might want to share it with.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t miss the way Peggy’s eyes pointed to a certain brunette pitcher, “Really? But what if…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s very private. Very discreet. I’ve been several times. Trust me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her heart pounding and suddenly struggled to swallow. It was like her throat was closing up from excitement. “Thanks, Peggy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have fun. Come on, we’ll drop you off.” She snapped her fingers, which caught the attention of her beau, who immediately bounded over like a loyal dog. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ready to go?” He asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mind giving my friends here a lift? They’re staying over at the motel for the night.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No problem!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha quickly ran over to Rio. She leaned in close, “Want to stay with me tonight?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio could only nod rapidly, “Where?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come with me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t have to be told twice. It was just a short five minute drive from the dancehall. Peggy pointed out the room and waved goodbye as she drove off into the night with her man. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned the key on door number ten and opened it. The alcohol was dulling her nerves and removing any doubts in her mind. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio followed her into the room. It was nothing special yet the energy seemed to buzz around them. A large queen bed sat dead center in the room. The walls were an unfortunate, dated yellow, and the floral curtains hung limply next to the only window. Besides a small side table with a lamp, there was only a dark wood dresser with a large mirror on top of it opposite the bed and a mismatched armchair in one corner. A door at the other end must be the bathroom. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are we doing, Agatha?” Rio pulled the curtains closed and looked at her companion. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t speak. She simply slipped out of her heels, unzipped her dress, stepped out of it, and gracefully laid down on the bed in nothing but her bra and underwear. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched every movement like a cat tracking a mouse. Her mouth went dry at the sight of Agatha’s boldness. She also felt hazy from the drinking that night, but suddenly, all her senses felt incredibly sharp. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, are you just going to stand there?” Agatha finally asked as Rio seemed to be broken. That was enough to spur on the pitcher to undress and launch herself onto the bed. The mattress squeaked unceremoniously. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They laid side by side, facing each other, taking in the other in reverent silence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You were extraordinary tonight - on the field. The way you handled all that pressure. I’ve never seen a more spectacular sight in my life.” Agatha said as she tenderly stroked a hand along Rio’s arm. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought you’d be worried…about, you know, Wanda seeing us…” Rio confessed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, “I don’t want to think about that. I don’t want to think about anything except for you. We deserve to celebrate. At least this once.” And she closed the small space between them and kissed Rio with abandon. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Their bodies connected like two magnets finally finding their pair. It was an instant bond. Rio released her worry and tumbled into Agatha, forgetting everything that threatened to harm this. Because at this moment, there could be nothing else. Nothing but the heat of Agatha’s mouth and the smoothness of her skin that seems to completely wrap itself around Rio. She swore she could feel Agatha everywhere, it was like she had dived into a pool of her. It was wet, beautiful, bliss. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Their undergarments soon found new homes on the floor, and now Rio was entirely overwhelmed. Agatha was on top of her, and her brain could no longer comprehend anything besides the sudden need to feel every inch of her skin. Rio’s hands ran up and down Agatha’s back, they gripped her hips and traced maddening lines down her sides. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was flying blind and loving it. She was never one to lead in the bedroom, but with Rio, she felt powerful for the first time in her life. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She felt dominant. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She broke their kiss and looked at the flustered Rio below her. Her lips were a mess of Agatha’s lipstick, her hair was spread around her haphazardly, and her eyes looked almost crazed with want. Agatha flipped them so she was laying on her back now, and she watched Rio lick her lips above her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio dove in for another kiss, but Agatha brought a hand up and smirked as she laid it on Rio’s head and pushed her down. Rio’s eyes widened as she began to kiss her way down Agatha’s body, trailing down along her jaw, slowly across her chest, down her stomach and towards her goal. Agatha’s breath felt ragged as her pulse pounded hard in her neck. She could swear she could feel her blood pumping through every vein. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio paused between the thighs of her lover, and she looked up with those stunning, brown eyes for permission, for reassurance, or simply just to watch the moment that her mouth connected with Agatha. It was like a beautiful exorcism. Agatha’s body jolted and her soul seemed to float away as she succumbed to the undeniable pleasure of Rio’s skilled tongue. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jesus Christ.” She sighed as dangerous feelings began to build. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was like drought-stricken soil. She was lapping at Agatha like she was finding her sole source for living. She thought nothing would compare with the joy of throwing a perfect game, but she hadn’t known that this was a possibility. Because the thrill of Agatha’s heels digging into her back, of her hands digging into her scalp, and the distinctive, addictive taste of her was a whole new level of heaven. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She could feel the tension rising as she labored at the altar of her desire and could tell Agatha was close to breaking. The hands on her head started holding her tight against her, and Rio kept going, desperate to take Agatha to the peak and watch her crash over it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right there, don’t stop.” The words were frantic as she could see Agatha’s eyes snapped shut and her body writhed like it was possessed. Then, with a snap, Rio felt her lover reach her crescendo, and she heard the indescribable moan of release as Agatha rode the waves of her orgasm to conclusion. Rio just watched and relished the privilege to be the source of Agatha’s satisfaction. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she felt her body relax, Rio slowly crawled her way up Agatha’s body and licked a teasing path up to her mouth. Their kiss was languid and slow as Agatha fought her way down from the highs of their shared sinful ways. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“God damn, Rio.” She said carefully against her mouth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I love it when you swear.” Rio noted with a self-satisfied smile. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I will swear in front of a priest if we can do that again.” Agatha laughed as she imagined what the local churchgoers would say if they saw where she was now. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’d do this for free everyday of the week. No need to commit blasphemy or anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Careful what you promise me. I might just hold you to that.” Agatha felt more alive than she had in years. She didn’t know that sex could be so freeing until now. Every previous sexual encounter suddenly felt like a waste of time, a sad performance that she regretted. She wanted, no, she needed more. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They spent the night in a marathon session of experimental worship of each other’s bodies. Agatha knew that the baseball season was about to end. Soon they would be miles and miles apart. She didn’t know how many more nights they would get to spend together. She was determined to make every second count. Rio was more than happy to indulge her every whim, her every desire, and show Agatha what she had been missing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>By morning, Agatha felt parched and spent. She put her head under the bathroom sink and sucked down water for at least a minute straight. In the mirror, she admired the bites and love marks that Rio had left along her breasts and other hidden parts. Rio had planted a seed within her when they first kissed, and now that seed was in full bloom inside. Agatha felt like a garden had grown within her, and she couldn’t believe it had been so empty before. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why couldn’t I have met you when I was younger?” Agatha picked her bra off the floor and began getting dressed as the morning dawn shone through the crack in the curtain. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re only 36.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“About to be 37.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked surprised, “When’s your birthday?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“September 21st. You’ll probably be back in Florida by then.” Agatha stepped back into her dress and turned to get Rio’s help to zip it up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kissed the bare skin on Agatha’s open back before closing the zipper, “Well, I’ll just have to get you something special before I go. How about a championship?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed her approval and turned back around to lace her arms around Rio’s neck, “That would be a pretty memorable present.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll do my best, m’lady.” Rio kissed her again and Agatha wondered if she would ever get tired of this. “But…if we don’t win, you’ll come back next season, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha paused and could see Rio’s eyes searching hers, “Umm, I haven’t decided yet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stepped back, “What do you mean?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I’ve been doing this for five years now. I just…I don’t know if I have another year in me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s face fell. She thought they would have more time, “Oh. I guess I just thought that…we’d get to play together again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart broke a little, “Hey, I don’t know yet. I haven’t told the coach anything yet. I just wanted to let you know where I’m at.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I get it. What do you think you’ll do - I mean, if you don’t come back?” Rio leaned down to put her shoes on. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ran a hand through her hair, trying to make it appear like she hadn’t just had sex all night long, “Go back to the factory I guess. There’s not many options for a gal with only a high school diploma.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You could go to college.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And study what? I would stick out like a sore thumb amongst all those young people.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You could be a teacher.” Rio said it like it was the most obvious solution. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What? Why do you say that?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re good with kids. I see you with Billy and Tommy. Those kids worship the ground you walk on, they hang on every word you say. And I see you with the younger players and even with me. You are a heck of a mentor. I’ve learned so much just from being around you and the things you’ve shared with me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t realize Rio paid that much attention to her, “I never thought of it like that. I just hate incompetence and know I can do things better.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You put on a thorny front, but under all those spikes, you care. That’s what makes you good at teaching. You’ll never admit it, but it’s true. I bet you were a great mom too.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha almost choked on a sob but tried her best to swallow it down along with all the tears that appeared in her eyes. </span>
<em>
<span>Keep it together. Keep it together. Change the subject. </span>
</em>
<span>“I heard you at the end of the game. When you thanked your parents...”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked away and sat down on the bed, leaving Agatha standing, “I didn’t think anyone heard me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What happened to them?” Agatha moved slowly to sit beside her but maintained a respectful distance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio methodically massaged the palm of her right hand nervously, “I never really knew them. They died when I was just three years old. We were living in Puerto Rico, and consumption was spreading rapidly through the island. They both got sick along with most of the small town we lived in. My mom sent for her sister to come get me as soon as the disease started spreading and that saved my life. She was able to smuggle me on a boat to Florida by pretending I was her child. But I never saw my parents again.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m so sorry. That’s awful.” Agatha knew the pain of losing a child so young, but she couldn’t imagine losing both parents as a toddler.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know it’s hard to miss what you never had. My aunt and uncle raised me like one of their own. I wish I had known my parents. The main thing I know is that they loved baseball. My aunt told me that my mom used to follow the local team, the Tiburones, on the road and watch all their games. And my dad worked as a ticket taker at the stadium in San Juan. When I play, I feel connected to them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t know that.” Agatha rubbed her hand in circles on Rio’s back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t like to talk about them. It shouldn’t still hurt this much.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt that deeply, “I still miss Nicky every single day. Time doesn’t make it better, it just dulls the immediacy of the pain.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wish I could stop it. I wish I could make it so less people felt like this.” Rio finally raised her head and looked at Agatha with sad eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Everyone dies one day. No matter how we try to fight it.” Agatha’s heart ached at this unfortunate truth. Rio turned and opened her arms. They hugged on the bed and tried to comfort the long ignored wounds in each other. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>“Welcome back lovergirl.” Peggy was reading on her bed in their shared room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had silently crawled through the window this morning. She and Rio had caught the early bus from Racine that dropped them near the stadium. “What did you tell Pearl and Gertie?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They didn’t ask. I think Ol’ Gerts was too excited from winning a couple bucks in the betting pool.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha breathed a sigh of relief and rummaged through her dresser for a change of clothes. She was still in her dress from last night. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy shut her book, “So…are you really going to make me ask?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was a ten out of ten.” Agatha bundled up her clothes and made for the bathroom before Peggy could ask any more follow ups. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she got back, freshly cleaned and feeling much more put together, Peggy stared her down, “I’m not going to push…yet.” She held up a note in her hand. “Wanda left this in the mailbox for you at some point.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The dreamy haze around Agatha suddenly dissolved. She grabbed the paper. “It says, ‘meet me at the diner at 10.’ Not much of a wordsmith is she?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What did you do?” Peggy asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nervously tried to play it off, “How should I know? Maybe she just wants a heart to heart before the season ends?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well you better run, it’s already half past nine.” Peggy checked her watch. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha walked to the diner and saw the distinctive redhead sitting at one of the window booths. She sat down opposite her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wanda.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks for coming.” Wanda’s voice gave away nothing. She sat still with her hands folded on top of the paper menu. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure, what did you want to talk about?” Agatha felt her leg bouncing rapidly but couldn’t stop it. She never fidgeted like this.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda grimaced subtly and took a long pause. Agatha felt like the seconds were crawling by. “I think you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes darted around. Everyone else in the diner was going about their business. They had no clue that her world was crumbling down, “What do you want me to say?” She finally blurted out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s the nature of your relationship with Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re…” Agatha’s hands were sweating. She rubbed them against her thighs. They hadn’t put a name on what they were. Was there a name for this? Girlfriends? Dating? Going steady? Nothing seemed to accurately describe how it felt. “We’re still figuring it out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda clicked her nails on the table. Agatha didn’t know when she found the time to get them professionally manicured given the relentless game schedule on top of twin boys. The redhead tilted her head, “But it’s…romantic?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed and threw her hands up, “Yes. Is that what you want to hear? What’s with the interrogation, Wanda? You saw us. Are you planning to turn us in, or what?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aren’t you worried? You’re clearly not being careful.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t plan on this happening. It just did. I can’t explain it.” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“These things don’t just happen, Agatha. It’s not right. Two women shouldn’t be together…like that.” Wanda spit the words out. Agatha was shocked at this response. Wanda was the closest thing to family she had on this team besides Peggy. She wasn’t naive, but the reality of the judgement was crushing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I haven’t changed. You know me. Come on, nothing’s changed.” Agatha said. Her voice shook as she tried to salvage this. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t want you around my children anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gasped. Her heart stopped, “What? You don’t mean that. You can’t…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t want you to influence them in any way. Just stay away from us, and I won’t say anything to anyone else.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Billy asked when I was going to visit him in New Jersey.” Agatha felt empty. It was all her worst fears coming to life. This was how it was going to be. If she kept pursuing things with Rio, this was how the rest of her life was going to go. </span>
</p><p>
<span>One painful rejection after another. She didn’t know if she could deal with more loss. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re no longer welcome. I’m sorry, Agatha. It’s for the children. I can’t have them around a…a…queer.” She whispered the slur like it stung her lips on the way out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat back like she had been slapped. There was nothing more to say. This was how the world felt about her now. She was something to be feared, something to exclude and remove. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda opened her mouth to say something but thought better of it and scooted out of the booth, grabbed her bag, and walked away. She knew her message had landed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat alone in the diner. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Spiraling.</span>

<span>Half the team took the two hour trip the next day after practice to Rockford. They were eager to catch game five of the other semi-final match, the Blue Sox vs the Peaches. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and Rio sat next to each other in the car the entire way, but Agatha simply stared out the window silently. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t know what had happened. After their victory the other night and the unforgettable stay in the motel, it felt like everything was going well. Now, Agatha felt distant and cold - like everything that had happened was forgotten. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve got a dollar on the Blue Sox winning.” Lupe said as they bought their tickets at the main entrance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dottie laughed, “That’s a long shot! The Peaches are clearly the favorites.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know, Dottie. South Bend has Corky Arnold. Agatha is still leading the league in home runs, but she is number two. I wouldn’t count them out.” Rio said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha just passed her coins over and took her ticket. She didn’t gloat about her record, didn’t offer any snarky remarks, it was so unlike her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled her to the side before they went through the turnstiles, “Okay, what the hell, Agatha? What did I do?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The catcher crossed her arms, “Nothing, Rio. I’m fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You sure don’t look fine. You’re treating me like a stranger. I thought…after everything…I thought we were good.” Rio leaned against the brick wall of the stadium as other excited fans passed by to get into the park. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed heavily like the weight of the world was pressing down on her lungs, “I just don’t think I can handle this.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Handle what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This! Us!” Agatha uncrossed her arms and threw them into the air but kept her voice from rising too high and drawing attention. “Wanda confronted me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio understood then. Agatha wasn’t angry - she was scared, “What did she say?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She doesn’t want me around the twins anymore.” Agatha said. The pain in her tone was evident. She had already lost one child in her life. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio clenched her fists and felt her jaw tick with tension, “She’s wrong.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No she’s not. What we’re doing…it’s wrong.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t mean that.” Rio’s heart was slowly crumbling. This couldn’t happen. Not again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The way Wanda feels, that’s how everyone else feels. You’re kidding yourself if you think otherwise.” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head, “I don’t think that’s true. I know how I feel about you, Agatha. I don’t want to live in a world where I don’t get to feel like this.” She hated how desperate she sounded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, well, well. If this isn’t a sight for sore eyes.” A new voice cut into the fray. They both looked up and saw two familiar faces striding towards them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rushed towards Greta and Carson with her arms wide. She hugged them both fiercely. They had no idea how much she needed this distraction right then. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you two doing here?” Rio asked when she finally stepped back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Our season on the road with the Sallies ended two weeks ago. We wanted to cheer on the Peaches again. Are you checking out the competition?” Carson guessed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah. You remember Agatha, and a few other Comets are already in the stands.” Rio said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey there, Angel.” Greta said with a flirtatious wave.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had zero desire to socialize right now but didn’t seem like she had much choice, “Greta, Carson, how’s it going?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh you know, we’re already in the off-season. Back to the boring reality of civilian life.  Can’t believe the Comets are going to finals. We’d kill to be in your position now. I could really use that cash bonus to prolong my return to rent and bills.” Greta said. She lived in California and worked as a production assistant on movie sets. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You doubted us?” Agatha asked with a smile, finally feeling a little more alive. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I never doubted Rio here. You’re damn lucky you got this gal on your team.” Greta put an arm around Rio’s shoulder. Agatha felt a surge of jealousy hit her in the gut like a sucker punch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about the rest of us? Just chopped liver?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio’s special. I think she could carry any team in this league to the finals on her back.” Greta’s hand slowly retracted and paused at Rio’s neck to play with her curls, which did little to tame the green monster in Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>One second ago she had been ready to end things, but now she bristled at the thought of another woman’s hands on what belonged to her. </span>
<em>
<span>Stupid, mushy heart.</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think we better take our seats. Right, Rio?” She reached out to grab the pitcher’s hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh, yeah. Will we see you guys after?” Rio asked her former teammates. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Meet us here after the game. We know a place in town that you might like - that you both might like.” Carson said with a wink. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let herself be led by the hand by Agatha, who was all but stomping to the entrance. They got through and easily found their seats along the first base side, towards the back, the rest of the team was already seated. The two took the final spots on the bench near the steps. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The announcer started his usual pre-game spiel. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned over, “What was that about? I thought you were saying we shouldn’t do this anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned her head, “We’re not doing anything.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes narrowed, “You looked like you were about to take a swing at Greta.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s head felt like a jumble of puzzle pieces. Nothing was matching up. She knew how she felt about Rio. She knew it was wrong. Or that everyone thought it was wrong. But the way it felt was like nothing she had ever experienced. She knew Wanda hated her now. She didn’t want to lose a close friend. She didn’t want to jeopardize her career. But seeing Greta touch Rio…it had made her forget all that. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was hers. She wanted Rio to be hers alone.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My head says we should stop.” Agatha whispered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And your heart?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I need more time.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio understood. She knew the realities of the world. It could be cruel and unyielding for women like them. Agatha was new to this. She was trying to protect herself, and Rio couldn’t fault her for that. She carefully laid her hand on Agatha’s, “I’ll wait for you - as long as you need.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The game was pretty boring for the first couple innings. It wasn’t until the bottom of the fourth that the Peaches scored two runs off a ground rule double. The packed stadium went crazy, which only encouraged the team further, and they ended up scoring another pair of runs to lead the Blue Sox, 4-0.</span>
</p><p>
<span>It seemed hopeless, but Corky lived up to her reputation and hit a homer in the seventh inning to claw one run back. Their team fought hard and scored another in the eighth, but it wasn’t enough. The shortstop threw out the last Blue Sox batter at first in the top of the ninth to close out the game. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Peaches were going to the championship. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and Rio told the rest of the team that they were going to hang around town for the night with some old teammates. Lupe decided to join them. She used to play with Greta and Carson a few years ago too. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey ladies.” Greta waved them over to the parking lot. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lupe! Good to see you.” Carson hugged her, “You coming with us?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Lupe nodded, “Wouldn’t miss it. You’re taking them to The Office, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, ma’am. Jump in.” Greta opened the back door of her red Cadillac for them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How do you know where we’re going?” Rio asked her fellow pitcher. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I showed Carson this place first, by accident.” Lupe said with a smirk. Agatha had no idea what they were talking about or where they could possibly be going. What office would be open this late?</span>
</p><p>
<span>The drive over as quick as it started. They were near the Rockford cinema, and Greta parked along the main street. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are we seeing a flick?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re not that square. Come on.” Greta looped her arm with Carson’s, and they led the group along the sidewalk. Carson looked both ways before dipping down a side alley. Agatha hesitated but didn’t want to be left alone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It must have been around 9pm. There weren’t many people out and about. The alley was dark, and there wasn’t much besides a dumpster and some trash cans. Greta and Carson went up a non-descript wooden staircase that led to an unmarked door beneath a bright blue lightbulb.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha fought against all the voices in her head that said “turn around!” She followed closely behind Rio as they entered the mysterious door. Inside, to her surprise, it looked like they were in someone’s office. There were filing cabinets lining the walls, a dim desk lamp, and a large desk facing them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tax problems? Because we do tax solutions.” A man in tie and suspenders asked. He was sitting at the chair behind the desk, writing in a logbook, then he looked up. “Oh, Greta. Go right through.”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks, Johnny.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She opened up what appeared to be a cabinet door on the wall. The group walked into an empty room. This one was curtained and bare of furniture, the plumbing pipes jutted from the brick walls. The soft sounds of a jazz number floated into the room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, what is this place?” Agatha said, exasperated. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Greta laughed, “It’s a place for us. A place where we can be free.” She approached the far wall and peeled back the curtain. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s jaw dropped as she crossed the barrier, her eyes couldn’t take in the scene fast enough. They entered into what appeared to be a secret club. There was a dance floor, tables and chairs scattered around the space, darts, moody lighting, and a small stage with a piano. Across the opposite wall was a beautiful wooden bar. A haze of cigarette smoke added to the allure. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She felt Rio pulling at her arm, “What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Look around.” Rio sounded awestruck as she properly took in her surroundings. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha finally looked past the surprise of the environment and noticed who was occupying the space. It felt like her eyes were about to pop out of her head when she realized. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Men slow dancing with other men, women cuddled close at a table, women in pants and suits, hands holding hands, brazen kisses on the dancefloor. Was that…Jo DeLuca kissing the Blue Sox relief pitcher? Agatha couldn’t believe it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pretty sweet, huh?” Carson elbowed her gently. She remembered feeling similarly the first time she found this place years ago. It was like the scene in Wizard of Oz when the world goes from sepia to full technicolor. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“But…how is this possible? Isn’t this…” Agatha stumbled over her words. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Illegal? Technically, yes. But they can’t legislate us out of existence. Did you think you were the only one?” Greta asked, wrapping her arm around Carson’s waist and pulling her close. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Honestly, a part of Agatha did. Well, besides Rio. Because it was all so hidden, sometimes she felt completely alone. “I had no idea.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Vi opened this joint with her wife, Edie. They’re over there, behind the bar.” Greta pointed to two women pouring drinks. One was dressed in a man’s three piece, pinstripe suit and had a tidy short haircut. She looked to be in her 60s. The other looked around the same age but was in a pretty floral dress, with typical curled, long hair. “They’re huge Peaches fans.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can I have this dance, m’lady?” Rio interrupted her thoughts and extended a hand as a young singer took the stage and began to croon Doris Day’s hit song “It’s Magic.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded and took her hand. They walked together to the middle of the floor besides two older gentlemen who gave them a knowing smile. Greta and Carson joined beside them. The lyrics echoed the moment.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Without a golden wand</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Or mystic charms,</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Fantastic things begin</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>When I am in your arms</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s arms laced around her waist lightly, and Agatha looped her arms around the pitcher’s neck. They moved slowly to the song, staring into each other’s eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>When we walk hand in hand</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The world becomes a wonderland</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>It’s magic</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you think there are more places like this out there?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If there’s a place like this in little, old Rockford, Illinois, then there must be hundreds or thousands across the country.” Rio reasoned. She couldn’t believe her luck. One moment Agatha had been contemplating cutting her out, and now they were dancing together in front of other people. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>How else can I explain</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Those rainbows when there is no rain</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>It’s magic</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry.” Agatha stepped closer and leaned her forehead against Rio’s. She knew it wasn’t enough. Those two words didn’t feel like enough to encompass her regret. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t blame you. This isn’t going to be easy. But maybe we could do it. If these other people can make it work, maybe we could too.” Rio wanted that desperately. She wanted to be with Agatha - more than just stolen moments in hotel rooms or empty locker rooms. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Why do I tell myself</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>These things that happen are really true</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>When in my heart I know</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The magic is my love for you</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>When the last note ended, the group joined Lupe at a table along with the Peaches’ left fielder. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Martha Everett.” She put a hand up in greeting, though most of them knew her already. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So…when did this happen?” Greta motioned between Agatha and Rio. “Last time we saw you, Rio, you were punching Angel in the face.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The group burst out laughing. Then Lupe added, “This is also news to me. I suspected something, but I never would have guessed you were one of us, Angel.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She couldn’t resist my charms.” Rio grinned widely. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed, “You were obsessed with me. If anything this is an act of charity.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oooh, well we know who wears the pants in this relationship.” Carson joked as Rio feigned hurt at Agatha’s quip. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know, I’ve always wondered, why do they call you Angel?” Martha asked Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned her head, “Yeah, I’ve always wondered that too.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled at the memory, “I thought you would have heard this by now. It’s not that exciting. People used to call me Hark when I first started in the league. It wasn’t until Wanda came along. Every single time Billy heard someone say ‘Hark’, he would bust out singing ‘Hark the herald angels sing!’. That was the only lyric the little 3 year old knew, so he would just repeat it over and over. The girls started calling me Angel just to shut him up!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio cracked up laughing along with Martha who added, “And here I thought it was because of your good behavior.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m no saint, honey.” Agatha showed her teeth and her mind immediately went to the debaucherous nights spent in bed with Rio. She didn’t think people would be calling her Angel if they knew about that. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How long have you two been together?” Rio saw Agatha drifting off and tried to change the subject to Greta and Carson. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Five years. I had my eye on this one since I first saw her at try-outs in ‘43.” Greta said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow. And are you together in the off-season or…?” Agatha was dying to know how they made this work for so long. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m married.” Carson admitted, holding up her left hand to show off the simple gold band. “Charlie’s a good husband. We have an…arrangement. During the season, I’m free to do as I please. When I’m home, I’m his wife.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you’re fine with this?” Agatha looked to Greta, who was staring sadly at the table. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It keeps us safe. We all have to make sacrifices as part of this particular life.” Greta said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha thought about her own situation. There was only one week left with Rio. What would she be willing to sacrifice? What would Rio be willing to sacrifice for her? What would they do to be together?</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>Rio stood on the train platform in Chicago the next day. She had borrowed Horsey’s car for the day, with the promise of a 12 pack of beer in return. She heard the train approaching before being able to see anything. She teetered on her feet in anticipation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The carriages rolled past slowly before coming to a stop. She scanned the disembarking passengers, craning to get a view over the crowd. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jen!” Rio caught sight of her best friend and rushed to greet her. They collided and almost fell over to the ground. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You look different.” Jen noted as she stepped back to take in Rio’s appearance. It had been almost half a year since they had laid eyes on each other. The longest time they’d ever been apart. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I feel different. Where’s Uncle Hector?” She scanned the people, searching for her uncle. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He was right behind me.” Jen was taller and spun around to locate her travelling companion. “There!” She pointed to a confused gentleman wandering near the bathrooms. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rushed over, “Tio! You made it!” She jumped into his arms and felt like she was a child again. Hector was 59, only a few inches taller than his niece and the proud owner of an impressively thick moustache. He was still very muscular from years laying bricks and swung Rio around like she weighed nothing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mija, I missed you so much. I knew you could do this! I’m so proud of you.” He set her down gently and picked his suitcase back up in one hand and put his other arm around her shoulders. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t believe I got you two out of Florida. Never thought I’d see the day.” Rio joked and led them to the parking lot. “How was the train ride?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Awful! It’s only thanks to your uncle that I wasn’t relegated to the colored carriage. I thought he was going to sock the train inspector who confronted me. Uncle Hector played blind and said I was his carer and needed to sit with him - sneaky devil.” Jen chuckled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wasn’t about to travel across the country by myself! I get lost walking down my own street. I never would have made it without Jen. I swear I forgot where my seat was about ten times on the trip.” Hector said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re terrible! Well, I’m glad you made it regardless.” Rio popped the trunk and got into the driver’s seat. She got all the gossip on the drive to Kenosha. Aunt Marisol was having a feud with the priest over an argument about after-church snacks, her cousin, Chris, was promoted to foreman at his construction job, her littlest cousin, Pascal, was the starting pitcher on his little league team, and Jen had quit the docks and was thinking of becoming an Avon lady. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And?” Jen prompted him.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked to her uncle and saw him hesitating, “What? What happened?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, nothing bad.” He reassured her. “It’s just…the bosses cut my hours. And your aunt’s been losing her ironing jobs as other folks have been getting laid off all over the neighborhood.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh no. What can I do?” Rio asked. She knew how tight their budget was already. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t worry, mi princesa. Christian is helping us out, and Julio just got a part time job at the car wash. We’ll figure it out. We always do.” His demeanor betrayed the confidence of his words. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Listen, we get a pay increase for making the finals. I’ll get an even bigger payday if we win it all. I want to help.” Rio knew that the team got extra wages for playing all these extra games. Greta told her about a bonus that accompanied the trophy too, usually around $500 each. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, if you win, then you earned it. Don’t you dare give that away to us.” Hector had on his stern voice. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pretended to relent but resolved in her mind that any winnings would go straight to her family. She wouldn’t let them suffer due to pride. She wanted to win before, but now she was determined to make it happen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Enough about us. When’s the first game?” Hector asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tomorrow night at 6pm. I’m starting games one, three, and five. And then I’ll pitch relief, if needed.” Rio said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They pulled into the local motel. Rio had paid for two rooms out of her savings, despite the protests from her guests. She liked being able to treat them, plus she was planning to stay with Jen for the five days that she was in town. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m meeting some friends for lunch. Do you want to come with us, Uncle Hector?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No thanks, mija. I think I’m just going to have a mid-day nap. I’ll see you later.” He grabbed his case and waved goodbye as Rio and Jen walked back to the car. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who are we meeting for lunch?” Jen asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Peggy and Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha? </span>
<em>
<span>Thee </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha?” Jen was giddy at the prospect. She had heard so much about the mysterious catcher from Rio over the past few months. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio groaned, “Yes, that one. Please don’t embarrass me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Me? I’d never! Do you think she would like to hear about who your first kiss was?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“NO! Don’t you dare.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What? I was a great kisser. I taught you everything you know.” Jen smacked her lips playfully. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio drove them to the diner and parked near the entrance. She didn’t see Agatha so got a table for four. Rio pointed out her favorite dishes on the menu. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m starving! I swear all these extra practices are making me ravenous.” Rio could hear Peggy’s distinctive accent the second they walked through the door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m getting my own basket of fries. Don’t steal mine this time.” Agatha said as they approached the booth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The two slid into the seats, “You must be Jen.” Agatha extended a hand. Rio had warned her they were coming yesterday. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You must be Agatha.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know me?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio hasn’t shut up about…OW!” Jen started before Rio kicked her beneath the table. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned forward over the table, “Oh? What’s this? Rio couldn’t shut up about me?” She was giddy at the thought. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, no, nothing!” Rio tried to ignore it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had on a sinister smile, “So Jen, how long have you and Rio been friends?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just about as long as I can remember. We lived on the same block and my brother was friends with her cousins. We felt like the only two girls in our whole neighborhood. Granted, she’d rather be playing baseball or football with the guys, but she’d also play house or dolls with me sometimes.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How sweet. And going back to what you said earlier…what has Rio told you about me?” Agatha asked. She could see Rio not so subtly shaking her head at Jen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen looked at Peggy quickly, wondering if she was able to speak freely. Agatha saw the look, “Peggy knows, don’t worry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, in that case, where to begin! She was so torn up about you from that first game. I thought I was going to gag, it was so sickly sweet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Jen</span>
</em>
<span>.” Rio grumbled her name in warning, but it was an empty threat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So many calls I had to listen to about how she didn’t think you’d ever like her. It was such a drag. It was a relief when you finally got together. I didn’t think I could stand her moping anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ran her hand along Rio’s thigh beside her, touched at the thought of Rio’s prior obsession, “Awww, she’s pretty cute, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I almost missed the sad yearning once she started going on and on about your beauty and your lips and-” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay! That’s enough of that.” Rio cut in again to save herself the embarrassment. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was just getting good!” Agatha whined. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen laughed, “But on a serious note, what are your plans together? Are you gonna come see us in Florida?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha paused. They hadn’t decided anything. Rio spoke instead, “We’re still figuring it out, Jen. This is all still very new.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine, fine, but I hope you know, if you hurt Rio, I’m coming for you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy snorted, “Ha! I like you.” Agatha forced a smile despite the real fear that Jen was not kidding. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After Agatha and Peggy left, Rio and Jen stayed for a while in the diner, enjoying the unlimited drip coffee. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I get it.” Jen nodded with wide eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha. Her whole deal. She’s hot, like actually smoking hot.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Rio fidgeted with her mug, “I’m well aware.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How did she ever fall for a scamp like you?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe I’m just lucky.” And Rio did feel like that was true. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>Game one of the championship was at home in Kenosha. Rio gave Uncle Hector and Jen directions on how to walk to the ballpark and told them to be there a bit early, otherwise they might get locked out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good luck. Show them what you’re made of.” Hector gave Rio a bear hug and held back his tears. He had always worried about his only girl, but seeing her here, seeing what she accomplished, he was so impressed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Give ‘em hell, Rio.” Jen put a hand on her friend’s shoulder, which felt grounding and helped calm Rio’s growing nerves. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll see you guys after.” Rio donned her Comets cap and made her way to the ballpark. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Along the way, cars honked at her and people shouted their excitement. The whole town was abuzz. Rio felt sudden dread - she didn’t want to let all these people down. She didn’t want to let her family down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As the team warmed up in the field, Rio and Agatha practiced in the bullpen. The sun was starting to drop in the sky, and the annoying gnats hovered above them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, what’s the verdict? Did Jen like me or not?” Agatha asked as they took a short water break together under the shaded awning. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She likes you. Maybe a bit too much for my liking.” Rio mumbled the last bit, and Agatha’s smile couldn’t be wider. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you going to introduce me to your uncle?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tossed the ball up and caught it in her glove, “He doesn’t know - about…well, you know. I’ll have to introduce you as just another teammate.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know. I’d still like to meet him.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright. After the game, follow me out.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>After a while, Peggy called them over to the dugout where Coach Grant was gathering the entire team. Lilia waved them over, and they stood near the back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is it. All the grinding, all the sweat, all the hard work has led us to this moment - the finals. There’s not much more to say that I haven’t already said. Don’t let the pressure bring you down. We’re just playing ball. Remember why you love this game. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Baseball is unlike anything else. It’s the only sport where we aren’t playing against time. There’s no clock, no countdown. Just you and your teammates fighting for three outs or fighting to stop the other team from getting three outs. Three outs. That’s it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The game can change on a dime. A team could score a hundred runs between outs two and three. So never let up. I don’t care if we’re leading by one run or ten. Let’s run up that score. No mercy!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No mercy!!” The team screamed with fire in their eyes. The battle cry they clung to for salvation. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Quite the pep talk there, Coach.” Agatha said while adjusting the straps on her chest protector. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Too much?” He cringed slightly. He had never been much of a fire and brimstone type leader. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I think it was just what they needed to hear. I agree, mercy is overrated.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Comets ran to their positions in the field and got ready for the first batter. Rio felt all the eyes on her. The stands were completely full. Even the field past the fences was packed with fans hoping to catch a home run ball. She couldn’t make out any individuals, it looked like a rolling mass of bodies in every direction. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She took comfort in the knowledge that Jen and her uncle were somewhere amongst the crowd. Agatha looked as calm as ever, but Rio knew that the catcher had only slept two hours last night. She had burned the midnight oil stressing over this game. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When the right fielder, Judith, walked over and settled into the batter’s box, Rio was ready. She was sick of the waiting and the nerves. Time to rip off the bandage. Agatha called for a fastball right out of the gates. She wanted to make an immediate statement. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio accepted the sign. She took in a deep breath and started her windup. As she kicked out her legs, she released the breath and hurled the ball with all her might. It zipped across the plate as Judith swung right over the top of it. “Strike.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The crowd applauded loudly as the game got underway. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The first two outs were easy. The third batter was the catcher, Carol Green. She was a long ball threat. The blonde had a low stance and waggled her bat as she waited for each pitch. Agatha knew her well. She called for a changeup, which Carol was too fast on and fouled off to the left. A curveball came next, which was a ball, a touch too low. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The fastball was right on target, but so was Carol’s bat. The crack reverberated in Agatha’s ears as the ball launched skyward toward left field. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Shirley tracked it backwards, running while trying to keep an eye on it over her shoulder. Unfortunately, she misjudged it and the ball dropped just at her feet. She scrambled to recover it and toss it to Peggy for the cut off. Carol had the wheels to make it to second though for a double. Agatha saw Rio’s body language drop and knew she was upset at this early setback, but she wasn’t worried yet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The next batter popped up a foul ball behind the plate, which Agatha caught for the final out, preventing the Peaches from scoring. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The catcher spoke low to Rio on their way into the dugout, “Don’t show your frustration so plainly. They’ll pounce on any sign of weakness.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry, sorry. It feels like my fault sometimes.” Rio confessed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“These are the best batters in the league. They’re bound to get a few hits, alright?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The pair walked down the steps. Agatha was immediately confronted by the twins, “Great catch, Auntie Aggie!” Billy yelled. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha immediately searched for Wanda, who was already rushing over. “Boys, come over here.” She said sharply. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“But mom!” Billy whined and reached out for Agatha’s hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t touch him!” Wanda snapped and quickly pulled the boy towards her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, calm down.” Rio moved to stand between them, trying to protect Agatha from Wanda, who resembled a fierce mama bear all of a sudden. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought I told you to stay away from them.” Wanda pointed a finger accusatorily towards the catcher. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Whoa, what’s going on?” Peggy stepped into the space as the rest of the team turned to stare. They may not all be best friends, but everyone treated each other with respect. This was very unusual. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom?” Billy looked sadly at his mother and then at Agatha, who couldn’t stand to see the hurt look on the young boy’s face. It was too painful. It brought back too many memories. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on, son.” Wanda ushered him to the far side of the space, turning her back on everyone else. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you alright?” Rio put a hand on Agatha’s back, which she flinched away from. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Forget about it. I’m fine.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Coach Grant leaned over from his spot on the steps. “Is there a problem?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was silent as she threw herself down on the bench and stoically watched Dottie head out to lead off the batting order. Peggy simply sat beside her and shook her head at the coach, trying to convey the message - </span>
<em>
<span>don’t ask</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The team got two singles, but the Peaches pitcher, Grace Nickelson, struck out two in a row and Dottie got thrown out at third. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The next inning was quick on defense. Rio set a relentless pace, and Agatha didn’t let the encounter with Wanda throw her off her game either. They sat down the batters in succession. On offense, Agatha was first to bat. She popped one up to the outfield right in the gap between right and center. It fell for a single as they got it in quickly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Coach Grant gave her the signal for a steal. Fossey was up next. Agatha waited for the right moment. The second the Peaches pitcher started her wind up, she took off towards second base. She tracked the ball out of her peripherals and saw the catcher had it. She slid hard, face first, and hit the base before the second baseman tapped her with the glove. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Safe!” The field ump shouted as he crossed and uncrossed his arms. The rush of adrenaline was pulsing through her as Agatha jumped up and pumped her fist. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She could barely feel the raw skin of her hands and arms that had scraped against the dirt to carry her to her destination. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Fossey performed a sacrifice bunt to advance Agatha to third. Then, Buckets nailed a worm burner right past the shortstop, which sent Agatha home for the first run of the game. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was waiting in the on deck circle and gave her a high-five, “Way to run those bases, Angel.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Keep the rally going, slugger.” Agatha grasped the pitcher’s hand and gave it a squeeze. Rio pulled back and saw blood on her palm. Her eyebrows raised in surprise. Agatha didn’t realize her hands were bleeding from the slide. Before she could apologize, Rio simply brought her own palm to her mouth and licked the blood off in one seamless swipe like a freak. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shouldn’t have been so turned on. But seeing Rio’s tongue like that…</span>
</p><p>
<span>She felt the warmth painting her cheeks red and fled the field for fear that someone might notice. Lilia helped clean and bandage up her hands and the scrapes on her arms. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio got a single but was left on base as the Peaches pulled off an impressive double play on the next hit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>By the eighth inning, the Comets were up by three runs. The Peaches had scored one in the third but hadn’t been able to create anything since.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Remember what I said. Don’t let up! Let’s finish them!” Coach Grant kept their energy high as they ran back out there. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha crouched down in her spot. The exhaustion was starting to hit her. Her mind was starting to wander. </span>
<em>
<span>Why is Wanda so repulsed by me? Am I really that bad? Am I disgusting? Is she right? I don’t think I can handle this. Billy’s face. He’s just a kid. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t fully register the batter now standing in front of her and called for a fastball. Rio took a second and shook it off. Agatha called it again. Rio knew the catcher wouldn’t call it twice unless she meant it. Bobbie loved fastballs, but maybe Agatha knew something she didn’t. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The ball came in high and fast. Rio saw the deep dimple on Bobbie’s cheek appear as the batter smiled. It was just what she was hoping for. Bobbie swung hard. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Back, back. That ball is crushed! It’s a home run for the third baseman, Bobbie Key!” The announcer shouted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ripped off her mask and watched in horror as the ball dropped over the fence and the fans scrambled to grab it. </span>
<em>
<span>What have I done?</span>
</em>
<span> Rio was looking at her with confusion. </span>
<em>
<span>I wasn’t paying attention - fuck. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The score was Comets 3, Peaches 2. It was close. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was keeping her cool surprisingly well. Agatha ran a hand down her face and then replaced her mask. She took in the batter fully this time. </span>
<em>
<span>Oh for god sake. </span>
</em>
<span>It was Martha Everett. The outfielder that she met at the clandestine gay bar. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Thankfully, the batter made no acknowledgement of their meeting. She swung at the first pitch, hit a bouncing grounder right to first, and was out. They finished the inning without further damage.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What happened with you?” Rio confronted Agatha as they sat down on the bench. There was a hint of venom in the question. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I got distracted. I’m really sorry. That was completely my fault.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That seemed to placate Rio for now, “I really want to win this, Agatha. Please.” It wasn’t a request. It was a wish, a tightly held hope. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know. This is all I’ve wanted since I joined the league. I need to win this too.” Agatha admitted. </span>

<p>

<span>Morris Markey</span>
</p>
</blockquote><p> </p><p>
<span>They won the first game. </span>
</p><p>
<span>How could they not. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pitched the entire nine innings. She closed it out without allowing any further hits and felt the euphoria of the final out of the game. Like a diamond under the earth’s surface, Rio thrived under pressure. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When the game finished, the fans rushed the field in celebration. It was a beautiful moment of chaos. There were still four games on the schedule, but winning the first felt special. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, you did it! You really did it!” Her uncle raced over to her immediately, followed by Jen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve never seen you play like that!” Jen yelled to be heard over the noise. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was swarmed by her numerous fans, who were eagerly holding out baseballs and cards to try to get her autograph. Peggy looked stunned in the middle of it all as a tall, All-American looking man leaned down to speak to her. Wanda had taken shelter in the dugout with the twins. Dottie was lapping it all up. Eventually the umpires got a handle on things and the announcer helped clear the field of all non-players. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Coach Grant corralled them back into the locker room as the excitement died down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“One down. That was a close one too, but just like always, you gals showed up when you needed to. Let’s keep the train chugging tomorrow!” He kept it short tonight. The entire team was on too much of a high to sit through a long speech. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Y’all, we could actually win this.” Dottie stood up on the bench, her cap was on backwards, “I’m so dang proud to be a Comet right now.” The group hollered their approval. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As the team happily packed up and went out to greet their loved ones, Peggy, Agatha, and Rio were the only ones left. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha saw Peggy picking at the knots in her mitt. “Rio, I’ll come out soon, okay? Don’t leave until I do.” The pitcher nodded and went. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Peg, I saw him.” Agatha sat beside her on the worn wooden bench. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The beautiful Brit looked up with tears in her eyes, “I thought it was a dream. I’ve imagined it enough times.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It was real. How did he find you? Where has he been?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy had met Steve Rogers in 1942 in Boston. He was on leave from the war. Agatha remembered the night in the bar when they had first connected. Those two spent a few glorious weeks together before he had to ship off back to the front lines. All she was left with was his silver lighter and the memory. He never got in touch again, and Peggy never got over him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He got injured and was recovering in a hospital in Berlin for several years. He got back to the states this summer and settled down in New York. It was just pure chance he saw an article about us in the Post. My name was mentioned, so he drove all the way here. It’s like something out of a movie!” She laughed at the absurdity. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How did he know it was the right Peggy Carter?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He just hoped it was! He’s waiting for me outside. He asked to take me out - said I owed him one more dance.” Peggy’s voice trembled. She was normally so sure of herself, so confident with men. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why’re you hiding in here then?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s been so long. I moved on. I tried so hard to move on. What if he doesn’t want me anymore? I’ve not exactly been a saint while he was away.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ll never find out in this dingy locker room. That man drove across four states on the off chance that he could see you again. Give him a chance at least.” Agatha stood up and offered her hand to help Peggy stand too. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re right.” Peggy dusted off her dress. “Keep the window cracked for me tonight?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Always.” Agatha walked with her out of the hallway towards the exit. Steve was standing against the telephone booth, as handsome as ever. Peggy gave Agatha one last look before rushing off into his waiting arms. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was absorbed in conversation with her guests when Agatha walked over. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, here’s someone I wanted you to meet. Uncle Hector, this is Agatha Harkness, the catcher on the Comets. She’s taught me so much since I joined the team.” Rio explained. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Hector gave Agatha a firm handshake, “Thank you for helping my girl. You two were so in sync out there. Truly professional.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio certainly makes my job easy. She’s easily the most talented pitcher I’ve ever caught for.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Natural born talent. That’s what I always said. She was throwing as hard as her cousins when she was barely this tall.” He held a hand up to his waist to indicate height. “I’m glad other people have the chance to see what I’ve always known.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio fought against the tears at the incredibly heartfelt compliment. Jen noticed immediately and tried to redirect the conversation, “Are you resting tomorrow, Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I’ll be on the bench unless I get called in. Agatha will be playing though.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is the other pitcher as good as our Rio?” Jen asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pretended to hum and haw over it to rile Rio up before giving a diplomatic response, “They’re all good in different ways. Lupe has more experience - she’s very talented.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen responded, “If you say so. Hey, we were going to go get some late night grub. Did you want to join?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha saw a very subtle shake of the head from Rio, “I’ve got other plans, but thank you for the invite. It was a pleasure to meet you, Hector, and you again Jen. I’ll see you tomorrow hopefully.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, she went straight back home to Gertie and Pearl’s. They had already retired to their rooms, so Agatha took a quick shower and went to bed as well. She laid on top of the blankets due to the heat and stared at the popcorn ceiling. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She replayed the moment with Wanda in the dugout. The redhead had approached her with such vitriol and fear. Agatha knew she was trying to protect her children, but protect them from what? They were friends. They had been friends anyway. It was all gone. Their entire history erased just like that. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Just because she had fallen for Rio? How could that change the entire foundation of their friendship? It seemed so petty and small. Why couldn’t Wanda let it go? But then, Agatha felt like she couldn’t let it go either. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her relationship with Rio was like a giant tattoo inked to her chest. It was so deep in her skin, yet at any moment, it felt like someone could pull back her shirt and reveal it to the world. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It felt rebellious, and this was not an age of rebellion. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>The second game was also at home in Kenosha, and just as many fans packed in to watch their team take on the Peaches. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy came home around midnight. Agatha heard her stumble and trip over a loose house slipper after climbing in the window. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Peggy?” She mumbled in her sleepy state. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Go back to sleep. I’m fine.” She reassured her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Now on their walk to the stadium, Agatha got all the details, “Was it like you pictured?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy physically swooned, “Better. He’s the whole package. A real sort.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s your rating?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We didn’t sleep together!” Peggy exclaimed, which stopped Agatha dead in her tracks. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes! We just sat at the bar all night and talked. He told me about his plans for the future, asked me about what I want to do with my life, and what I’ve been up to. We just…talked.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s so sweet I feel like I’ve got a cavity.” Agatha knew that Peggy wanted to settle down one day </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks, doll. And what about your happy ending?” She wondered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, Gregory Peck.” Peggy sarcastically replied, “Yes, obviously Rio.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t think we’re going to have a happy ending like you.” Agatha kicked a loose pebble on the sidewalk and watched it bounce into the gutter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why not?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed heavily, “The world isn’t built for us! Have you noticed how Wanda’s been lately around me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, what’s her deal?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She found out. She saw Rio and I kissing after practice and basically disowned me - said she didn’t want me around the twins.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy gasped and put her hand over her mouth, “I thought Little Red was just having a bad day. I didn’t realize…god, I should have known. I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You have nothing to apologize for. She just said what everyone else would in this situation.” Agatha’s head fell. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not me. It’s close minded. I’ve never seen you happier than when you’re with Rio. Don’t let one fool ruin that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t even focus on that right now. It’s too big. All I want now is to win these next games. This is what we used to dream about before all this lovey dovey nonsense!” Agatha, ever the deflector, turned the conversation around to baseball - safe, not scary baseball. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy had a glint in her eye but didn’t push too hard, “Life seems so easy on the field - just a game of winners and losers.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s make sure we’re the winners.” Agatha picked up her pace as they approached the ballpark. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lupe led the team on defence from the pitcher’s mound this time as Rio rested her arm. The Spanish Striker was a veteran hurler at this point, and no stranger to the finals but had never won one. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha liked the predictability that Lupe brought. It was easier on the mitt and the mind - a welcome break from Rio. The first two innings flew by as the Peaches failed to connect with the ball in any meaningful way. </span>
</p><p>
<span>In the third, Peggy scored off a long fly ball off Agatha’s bat. Then, as payback Babs Miller, the centerfielder, hit a monster homer to tie up the game 1-1. Lupe took it on the chin, but Agatha could see the frustration building. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s alright. It’s still early in the game. Let’s keep those bats going. Come on!” Coach Grant counselled them as they entered the fourth inning. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Things remained all tied up inning after inning. In the seventh, Rockford were up to bat again, and Martha was on first base. Their catcher, Carol, ripped one right past Peggy at shortstop and Martha took off, rounding second, going for third. Shirley scooped up the ball and launched it to Horsey at third, who tagged the runner for a smooth out. The crowd applauded the impressive play by the fielders. </span>
</p><p>
<span>In the last inning of the game, things were getting desperate. Neither team had scored. The Comets were up first. Dottie entered the box, raring to hit. She swung way too hard at the first pitch and went right over it for a strike. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lay off the low ones!” Peggy called out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The next pitch missed the zone, but the following one was a curveball, just outside. Dottie swung and got a piece of it. The ball slid across the dirt towards second base, but the pitcher fielded it quickly and tossed it to first for an out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Bad luck, kid.” Rio offered as Dottie re-entered the dugout slowly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda was up next. The redhead had barely spoken to anyone the past two games. She seemed distant and removed. They all figured she was trying to disconnect early since this was her last season. Agatha knew the truth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The first pitch was way outside. A clear mistake by the pitcher, Alice Hall. Agatha didn’t know much about her. She used to be an outfielder, but they must have re-trained her as a pitcher when the league went overhand. She lacked finesse and control. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda gripped the bat tight and swung away at the third pitch.. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The announcer’s voice howled, “She is red hot tonight! Wanda Maximoff sends one outta here! Homeeeeee runnnnnn!!!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The team jumped and screamed in the dugout as Wanda touched every base. The Comets were now leading 2-1. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As the redhead returned, everyone patted her on the back and congratulated her. Agatha went in for a celebratory hug out of excitement, which was instantly extinguished when Wanda cringed away and avoided even touching her. </span>
<em>
<span>Oh right, I’m the enemy now. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy noticed and shot daggers at Wanda in protest. Rio was too far away to have seen anything. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s lucky she’s leaving because otherwise I’d been having serious words with her.” Peggy was fuming as she watched Wanda celebrate with the rest of the teammates. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just leave it. She’s not worth it.” Agatha said. She didn’t want to stir up more drama than necessary this close to the season’s end. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The game finished with another Comets win. One more and that was it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>One more win and they would be champions. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>Rio was the starter for game three, which would be their last in Kenosha. As the winners of the league, they had secured home field advantage, but if the series went to game four and five, they would have to travel to Rockford. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hope you guys finish them off tonight.” Jen said over breakfast at the diner with Rio and Hector. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah me too. I don’t think my arm can make it much longer.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you hurting, mija?” Hector asked with concern. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine. It just gets a bit sore after going a full nine innings. And I’m giving it my all, so it’s extra tender. But I’ll be alright.” Rio knew how much her body could take. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She loved having her family here, but she also missed Agatha deeply. The two hadn’t been able to spend any time alone together. Things had been so hectic that they barely had time to see each other at all outside the games. And time was ticking down fast. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio finally caught Agatha a few minutes before their pre-game practice. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, can we talk?” Rio asked, nodding towards the equipment closet. They stepped into the room filled with buckets of baseballs, old mitts and cleats, and racks full of all sorts of broken and old bats. It could maybe fit four people snugly and was lit by a single, small rectangular window on the back wall. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s up?” Agatha leaned against the shelving and crossed her arms. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I miss you.” Rio leaned back against the wall opposite the catcher. There was only an arm’s length between them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why don’t you want me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can’t what?” Rio was tired of this hot and cold behavior. “I know Wanda got in your head, but I don’t want to waste what little time we have left. What if this is it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We could see each other next season. Like Greta and Carson.” Agatha offered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought you were done. I thought you were retiring.” Rio remembered Agatha mentioning that before. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I haven’t decided yet. This won’t be goodbye forever either way. We’ll find a way to see each other.” Agatha wanted to believe that was true. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you mean? I’ll give you my phone number. You can call me anytime. You can come visit if you want. I’m not going to disappear, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The pitcher finally released a smile. She took a chance and pushed off the wall and stepped forward into Agatha’s space. She felt the shift in the air as her hands found Agatha’s waist. The walls felt like they were closing in around them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio paused, her face just an inch or so from Agatha’s. She breathed in the air coming from Agatha’s lungs and enjoyed the radiating heat from the other’s close body. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha realized Rio was giving her a choice by not going all the way. She could run. Dip out of the closet and get back to the game, forget this dance with the devil. Instead, she chose the second option. She slammed their lips together in a forceful kiss. She bit hard on Rio’s bottom lip and then soothed it with her tongue. She pushed the pitcher backwards until she hit the wall and moaned at the contact. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was hello, it was goodbye, it was I don’t know what this is and I can’t even think right now to figure it out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she came up for air, she felt energized, “Go on, get to the locker room before they notice we’re late.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why do I have to go first?” Rio wondered, still dazed from the kiss. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because I like to watch you.” Agatha grinned. She felt invincible. Maybe, for once, things were going to work out in her favor. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After the warm up, right before the anthem, Agatha addressed the team, “This could be our last game. We’ve played over a hundred games together this season, and it all comes down to this. We could finish it right here, right now. Some of you know that I joined the league to run from something, to run from my problems back home. I used to do that a lot. Run away from anything that scared me. I still struggle with that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She gave Rio a sympathetic nod. A tiny apology that only she would understand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha continued, “But I’m trying. This league has taught me how to be brave, how to be strong, how to fight for what I want. And all I want right now is to win! I’ve accomplished so many of my goals so far. Help me cross off this one, and I’ll owe you all my life. Put your hands in.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The team piled their hands on top of each other in a circle. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha led them, “Fight on three. One, two, three.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“FIGHT!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha thought back to her previous life, her life before baseball. She had been a wife and a mother. She had been drifting - a passenger in her life. When it all disappeared, she was like a ship with no anchor. Baseball had pulled her back to shore. It had been her lighthouse in a storm. As she took her place behind the plate, she knew this might be the last time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It had been five years of highs and lows. The entire game revolved around the 17 inch plate in front of her. The white rubber saw it all - the elation of a walk-off home run, the devastation of a third out strikeout, the relief of a safe slide for a run. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had been there for it all. There was only one more thing she wanted to achieve in her career before retiring. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As the game got underway, every player had the same goal in mind, though different motivations. </span>
</p><p>
<b>Right Field - Fern “Fossey” Foss</b>
</p><p>
<span>The first inning yielded no action for the right fielder. The Canadian had only played in the league for two years. She prided herself on her strong arm and was training with Rio to learn how to pitch. Rio was the best teacher she’d had. Fossey loved learning something new. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d been recruited after a scout spotted her playing on her town team in the city championship. That had been the last time she’d played in a big game like this. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her team lost that day. She wasn’t going to repeat that mistake again. </span>
</p><p>
<b>Center Field - Loretta “Buckets” Buckley</b>
</p><p>
<span>Loretta caught a pop-up in the second inning for an out and threw it in to hold the runner at first. Buckets, as the team affectionately called her, was 28 and hailed from Knoxville, Tennessee. She’d lied to her mama at first and said she was volunteering to collect war bonds because she would never have been allowed to leave home otherwise. Baseball had been her private hobby. She never imagined that she’d be able to earn a salary from it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When the cheques started arriving back home, her mama was so happy for the extra cash that she didn’t bother asking where the money was coming from. Buckets could swing a bat with enough power to clear the fences and had impressive speed on the bases.</span>
</p><p>
<span>In the bottom of the second, she hit a line drive through the gap between third and short and got on base. She stole second but ended up stranded. Buckets hated being left on base. It was like getting a tiny taste of a delicious meal and not being able to finish. She knew how much the rest of the team wanted to win, and she wanted to contribute. </span>
</p><p>
<b>Left Field - Shirley Cohen</b>
</p><p>
<span>The native New Yorker had baseball running through her blood. Her father and her grandfather had played the sport as boys in the streets of Brooklyn. She had grown up going to Robins (later renamed to the Dodgers) games whenever they were able to scrounge up money for tickets. Shirley loved baseball like some people loved a sibling. She had grown up with it. It was a constant throughout every year. It had brought her joy. It had brought her heartache.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She was a hypochondriac in her regular life, but on the field, she was rough and tumble. She would dive and slide and put her body on the line to make a play. All her anxiety faded away when a mitt was on her hand. Her father told her not to bother coming home until she won a trophy, so she lived in Chicago during the off-season. </span>
</p><p>
<span>In the third inning, she saw a juicy curveball approaching the plate while she was up. She remembered hearing Johnny Frederick, the Robins outfielder, once on the radio saying that hitting is all about timing. She laid back and let the ball approach. She used her hips to swing the bat around and smacked it hard. The ball followed the first base foul line and landed just fair. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Go Shirley!” She heard the crowd scream as she rounded the bags. Coach Grant motioned towards him frantically, calling her to third. She booked it and watched him as he pointed down. She slid. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Safe!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Shirley jumped up and felt like the winning show pony. She’d just hit a triple. </span>
</p><p>
<b>Third Base - Rose “Horsey” Horstman</b>
</p><p>
<span>The hometown girl, Horsey, hooted and hollered as Shirley sped around the bases. Rose was born and raised in Kenosha. Her parents had settled down in this suburb after fleeing the chill of Minneapolis. She liked the small town feeling and the community spirit. When Mr. Wrigley decided to base one of the new women’s ballclubs here, it felt like destiny. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Horsey had three older sisters and always felt like the black sheep. While they were all preoccupied with dolls, make-up, and the neighborhood boys, Horsey would trail after their father to his recreational baseball games. She learned how to catch by playing outfield during their batting practices and how to accurately spit chewing tobacco at way too young an age. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her father always lamented never making the majors. He had reached the minors as a young man, but when his future wife got pregnant, he gave up the game and took a carpentry apprenticeship instead. He may have left the game, but it never left him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When Horsey came home with a contract to play pro ball, he cried for the first time in decades. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After Shirley hit the triple, Buckets batted her in with a dangerous grounder that took a nasty hop and bounced right past the Peaches second baseman. They were first on the scoreboard. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s it! Way to go, Comets!!” Horsey could hear her father’s voice above the crowd. His midwest accent and distinctive low tone was recognizable to her anywhere. He came to every home game and sat right behind their dugout. He would probably die of happiness if they won tonight. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She felt like she owed this to him.</span>
</p><p>
<b>Shortstop - Peggy Carter</b>
</p><p>
<span>In the top of the fourth inning, a ball off Martha Everett came right off the bat towards Peggy. She saw its trajectory and nabbed it in her mitt, tossed the ball to Wanda at second for the force out, then on to Dottie at first for a double play. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She looked to the stands and saw Steve on his feet, clapping loudly, and her heart soared. She couldn’t believe that he was really here. She had given up hope so long ago and filled her heart with beautiful distractions.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Baseball had long since failed to excite her. She mostly stayed for Agatha and the steady pay. It was a great escape from daily life. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But lately, all she daydreamed about was daily life. She found her mind drifting to a house in the suburbs, a handful of children, and slow dancing in the living room with a man she loved. She never wanted to admit that the man she imagined bore a striking resemblance to the military officer who stole her heart six years ago. However, now that he was real and just steps away in the stands, she could see it as a possibility. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As the inning turned over, she was up to bat. Dottie was on first. One out. The ball came in low and slow for a ball. The next two were outside the zone as well. Three balls, no strikes. The pitcher looked worried. The last pitch was high. She took the walk - a free pass to first base. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Shirley popped one up high next. The umpire called an infield fly, thus the batter was out. Agatha stepped up. Two outs. Two runners on base. Peggy saw the fire in her friend’s eyes. She was so focussed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy hoped that if they won this game, they could finally retire. She could finally start a brand new life. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clobbered the ball. Peggy watched it, holding her run until the ball dropped. It looked like it had a chance but instead hit the dirt inside the fence. Peggy saw Dottie booking it home, touching home for another run. The fans were going wild. She kept an eye on the ball as it hit the cut-off. She could make it home. She forced her legs to move as she felt the burn in her thighs. She touched home plate as the ball flew wide and missed the catcher. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Comets 3, Peaches 0. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy looked up to the bleachers. Steve was waving to get her attention. His eyes seemed to reflect the bright lights - they were glowing at her. He raised his hand and blew her a kiss. It was so innocent and stupidly romantic. Peggy caught it in her dusty hand and felt the goosebumps break out across her arms. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Trophy or not, she felt like she’d already won. </span>
</p><p>
<b>Second base - Wanda “Little Red” Maximoff</b>
</p><p>
<span>Going into the fifth inning, they had a healthy lead. Wanda carried the worry on her shoulders but felt it ease a little bit. This was her last season. There were no re-dos, no second chances. She had decided at the start of the year that this was it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was so ready to leave this league behind. She was grateful for the experience and the salary, but the past few weeks had tainted her memory of it all. Wanda did not want her sons around people like this. They were about to start school. She wanted them to have stability, normalcy, and a regular life. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She’d saved a good chunk of her pay from the league, but the bonus from winning the championship would be a welcome goodbye gift. She would use it to buy new furniture for the boys’ room. They deserved the very best, and she’d do whatever it took to give it to them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Babs Miller lined one right at her. Wanda jumped high and was able to catch it in the air for an out. The Peaches were struggling to put the ball in play. They had a few hits but no runs. Rio was so good at giving them nothing good to hit. Wanda didn’t understand how Rio and Agatha could…no, she didn’t want to think about that further. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She just wanted to win this game and get out of here. </span>
</p><p>
<b>First base - Dorothy “Dottie” Simpson</b>
</p><p>
<span>The next Peaches batter was Mary Richards. Dottie knew her well. They used to play together in the same county softball league back home in South Carolina. Mary stole the most bases of any player in league history. She had been recruited from the track team and proved her worth immediately.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Dottie was the opposite. Tall, lanky, and slow. She excelled as a first baseman, mostly due to being a lefty. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her parents thought she was joking when she said she was moving to Wisconsin to play baseball. The youngest of five, she was the clown of the bunch, but when she showed them the contract, they realized their jokester was serious. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Dottie promised her mother she’d still go to church every Sunday (she didn’t) and that she’d never touch alcohol (she did), and they let her go. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The charming 24-year-old had never been away from home in her life, and she loved every second of it. There were none of the old Southern conventions and expectations on her. She could earn her own money, live away from her parents, and skip church. She never wanted this career to end. She hoped to play ball for the rest of her life. They would have to drag her from the field kicking and screaming before she would give up this freedom. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Mary hit a grounder to third. Horsey threw it hard across the infield to Dottie, but Mary was too fast - safe. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Evening, Dottie.” Mary drawled out as she kept one foot on first base. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How ya doin’?” Dottie smiled at her old acquaintance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The next batter got set. Mary took a lead off the base. Dottie remained close to tag her out if needed. Agatha was closely watching the runner. Mary took another small step towards second. Agatha gave a signal and Rio threw it to first. Dottie tagged Mary but was too late - she’d already stepped back on the base. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So close, but yet…” Mary murmured. Dottie bit her tongue. Her mother always said if you have nothing nice to say, don’t say nothing at all. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio struck out the batter for the second out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Looks like y’all just can’t get it together tonight.” Dottie took the turn to gloat this time as she circled the base. Mary sucked her teeth and stayed quiet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Peaches catcher, Carol, was up. On the very first pitch, Mary took off. Dottie yelled out “Steal!” and saw Agatha pop up, catch the ball, and fire to second. It was a millisecond too late. Mary was safe. The runner saluted Dottie, which only made her angrier. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Luckily, Rio squashed any hope of scoring by striking out Carol and ending the inning. Dottie jogged past Mary as they crossed paths, “Better luck next time.” She grinned. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The Peaches seemed off their game. Dottie felt like nothing could stop the Comets now.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Winning the championship would put her in a much stronger position for contract negotiations next year. She could ask for a raise finally (even though she would do this job for free).</span>
</p><p>
<b>Coach - Victor “Doc” Grant</b>
</p><p>
<span>Four innings to go. This was the closest he had ever been to a win. He had made it to the Minor League World Series with the Chattanooga Lookouts when he was 22, but they lost it in game six. When he played for the Reds, they never even made it to the post-season. Then, his knee went and that was that. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Doc was single. He’d been engaged once upon a time to Sally Knight, one of his old teammate’s sisters. When they were planning the wedding, he got the call that he’d been selected as one of the coaches for the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. He could either stay in Ohio and pick out his wedding tux, or pack up his life and move to Wisconsin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>He had his bags packed that night. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Now it was all about to pay off. If he could secure this win and lead the Comets to victory, he might get an offer from a minor league team or even an assistant position in the majors. He had seen it happen for others, why not him?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Keep pushing, Rio! You got this!” He encouraged the pitcher. She was a phenomenon. He wondered whether any male baseball teams would give her a chance. He felt confident that she could handle it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kept the Peaches score at zero as they entered the bottom of the fifth. </span>
</p><p>
<b>Chaperone - Lilia Calderu</b>
</p><p>
<span>There wasn’t much for a chaperone to do during the games. She would occasionally patch up cuts and injuries, especially from slides. Most of the time, Lilia spent the time observing the night sky. On this September evening, there was a half moon shining over them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She knew that tonight was the conjunction of the Moon and Jupiter, which often signified financial gains. During this time, people often felt healthy and ambitious. It was the perfect omen for this game. The team appeared to be in high spirits, which could be due to Saturn’s opposition with the sun. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia enjoyed the atmosphere of excitement around her even as she felt separate from it all. She considered going back to nursing sometimes, but other times, she doubted she could handle the stress again. This unexpected career was a nice way to stay connected with the community in her old age. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Retirement sounded like a drip. She didn’t know how long this would last, but she was going to enjoy it while she could. </span>
</p><p>
<b>Catcher - Agatha “Angel” Harkness</b>
</p><p>
<span>The game was going better than expected. Agatha watched Fossey step up to bat. She hit a fly ball towards left, but the third baseman was able to track back and catch it. Buckets was up next. She fouled two and then swung at a tricky cutter - two outs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Save us, Rio, you’re our only hope.” Agatha cupped her hands and shouted towards the pitcher who was taking a turn in the lineup. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood tall and waited on it. She watched two strikes pass her by. Agatha could tell that she recognized them, but Rio was patient, she was waiting for something. A ball flew wide, then the pitcher gave Rio just what she wanted - fastball, outside corner. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“There she goes! The Reaper sends it back, back, oh no! It’s foul! Foul ball!” The announcer yelled in disappointment as the ball hooked left and landed in the stands foul. Agatha watched Rio’s face fall as she was forced back into the batter’s box to try again. The next pitch was a changeup, but Rio anticipated speed and swung too early. Strike out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As the pitcher trudged back into the dugout, Agatha remarked, “Never thought I’d see the day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t test me.” Rio snapped, still angry from her plate appearance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just kidding! We’re way ahead, you’ve got nothing to worry about.” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Back in the field in the sixth inning, Rio was back to her normal self. Her arm was like a cannon. She kept reloading and firing at full capacity as if she had endless powder in the tank. Hattie Walker was up and jittery as there were already two outs. Agatha called for a knuckleball, which worked like a charm for strike one. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The next pitch, she gave the sign for a fastball. Hattie swung and the ball shot straight up in the air. Agatha ripped her mask off and looked up. The ball was arcing right fast. She sprinted towards the fence, never taking her eye off the ball as it fell towards the stands. Agatha didn’t hesitate, she jumped and reached for the ball as her body careened over the barrier and into the fans in the front row. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She never let her arm drop. Her glove was high in the air, grasping the baseball firmly. She’d caught it! Her head was in someone’s lap, her legs were askew, but she had caught it. Another inning retired. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What a play by Angel Harkness! You’ll never see a better catch than that! That was incredible!” She could hear the announcer’s voice over the cheers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>One of the fans helped push her up, she stood on her feet, and she felt it. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>No. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>No. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>No. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Her knee buckled. She tried to step over the low fence to get back on the field, and her right leg wouldn’t bend. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck. Fuck. No, no!</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She tried to put pressure on it and almost screamed in agony. She couldn’t bend it, she couldn’t put weight on it. She tottered on one leg and panicked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha? What’s wrong?” Rio had immediately run over to help her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“My knee.” Agatha’s voice broke. Rio sat on the wall and helped Agatha do the same. She helped her swing her legs around to the field side and then lifted her over to the dirt. Agatha tried to stand again and would have collapsed if Rio’s arm hadn’t been around her waist. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Agatha…</span>
</em>
<span>” Rio began. </span>
</p><p><span>“</span><b>No!</b><span>”</span> <span>Agatha cried out. She could barely recognize her own voice. All she knew was that this couldn’t be it. She couldn’t end her career like this. She tried again to put weight on her leg as Rio practically carried her to the dugout. The pain was blinding, but she forced it down and was able to take a step. Then another, then another. </span></p><p>
<span>“How did you catch that ball, Angel? I’ve never seen anything like that before!” Horsey asked as they hobbled to the bench. Rio eased her down on the bench, and she lifted her leg to rest on it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, Harkness?” Coach Grant stood before her. He wasn’t blind. He knew that look all too well. The fear on every athlete’s face when their body fails them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just peachy.” Agatha declared with her signature smile, trying to hide the pain. “Ha, get it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The coach's eyes narrowed, “Stand up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m tired, sir. Can’t a girl have a rest?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha. If you don’t stand, I’m pulling you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The catcher chewed the insult she wanted to dish out. She set her jaw and bit the inside of her cheek as she lowered her leg and pushed off the bench. It was torture, but she knew how to handle pain. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They weren’t going to take this away from her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She stood unsteadily and stared at the coach with a look that said </span>
<em>
<span>see?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She did what he had asked. She wasn’t going to let him bench her. She deserved to play. She deserved to win. </span>
</p><p>
<span>For once in her life, she deserved to come out on top. </span>
</p><p>
<b>Pitcher - Rio “The Reaper” Vidal</b>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was not okay in any sense of the word. Rio’s heart was shattering watching her act like nothing was wrong. She was so desperate to win that she was willing to give up her body to get it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can see you’re going to be stubborn about this, Harkness. So it’s not up to you anymore. Rio, you tell me what I should do. You need a catcher who can actually catch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s world stopped. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t want to do this. She couldn’t be the one to decide…this. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at her with a pleading sorrow in her eyes, “Please.” Then Rio swore she mouthed the words “My love” but she couldn’t be sure. Her vision felt blurred and hazy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio replayed every moment together. The fights, the laughs, the unbelievable love. How was it all coming down to this?</span>
</p><p>
<span>She knew Agatha wanted to win. She couldn’t imagine winning without her. But, she couldn’t see how Agatha could play the rest of the game. She might do serious damage to her knee and end up permanently injured - and for what? Was a trophy worth a lifetime of pain? </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio closed her eyes as Agatha’s pleas got louder, “Please, Rio. Please! I need more time. Please!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The dugout was silent as the team watched on helplessly. Tears fell quietly. Nobody wanted to see a fellow player get benched for an injury. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio opened her eyes and met Agatha’s. They were pulsing with agony as if she was trying to hypnotize Rio into letting her stay. Her hair was matted with sweat, her hands were shaking. Rio wished she could tear off her own leg and offer it up as sacrifice. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you do this, I will hate you forever.” Agatha’s words sliced through her. The pain felt like a relief from the incoming guilt. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at Coach Grant. If she could prevent Agatha from an awful injury, she could live with the grief of this betrayal. The whole team was counting on this win. She needed this to be over. She needed this to be done. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She hardened her heart and delivered the final blow, “She can’t play.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha descended into sobs. Her face distorted with pain as her injury and the words crushed her. Peggy grabbed her before she fell to the ground and escorted her out of the dugout as the team could only watch in shock. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wouldn’t see Agatha again…</span>
</p><p>
<span>for over fifteen years. </span>

<em>
<span>March 1963</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Cambridge, Massachusetts </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The lecture hall emptied with a stampede after the professor released the class for the morning. Each student rushing on to their next class or their next break.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“William.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The young man paused on the steps as Professor Emerson called out his name. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sir?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You live near Cambridge Common, right?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you able to deliver this to Dr. Goodwin in the medical department at Radcliffe College? I would normally ask my assistant but he’s off sick today.” The professor handed over a heavy textbook and a folder of papers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not a problem, sir. I’ll head straight there.” William shouldered his bag and held the delivery close as he rushed up the stairs and out of the building. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was spring on campus - the snow had finally dissipated and the flowers were peeking out from their hibernation. Harvard was picture perfect. William was 20 years old and finishing up his sophomore year. He finally felt settled in, as his first year had felt like being dropped into an ice cold lake. Walking around campus now, it felt familiar and comfortable. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey there.” Eddie appeared from nowhere, suddenly walking in lockstep with him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey!” William gave him a genuine smile. Eddie lived across the hall and was…well, they hadn’t decided what they were yet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought you had a break now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I’ve just got to deliver something to a professor at the women’s college.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, I’ll meet you back at my dorm.” Eddie showed off his adorable dimple and leaned close, “I’ll keep the bed warm.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>William felt his face flush, and he nodded quietly, while speed walking to get this errand over with. He had never visited the Radcliffe buildings before. It was Harvard’s sister school for women as the Ivy League institution was still male-only.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They shared the same faculty as Harvard, so the students were taught by some of the greatest minds in their respective fields. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He found the medical building easily. The four story brick building was in classical colonial style like much of the campus. He walked in the large wooden doors and scanned the directions on the wall. Room 235 - Medical Research. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The stairs were to his left. It was just after 10AM, and students were coming and going down the hallways. As he approached room 235, groups of women were exiting. He waited outside the door to get in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There were all sorts of women coming out of the room. Most looked older than him - it must be a graduate level course. His eyes connected with one woman, who was by herself. He did a double then triple take as she passed. Why did she look so familiar? </span>
</p><p>
<span>William trawled his mind. He knew that face. He couldn’t place where. She was halfway down the hall. It couldn’t be…could it? </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?” He ran, calling out the name he couldn’t believe he pulled from his memory. </span>
</p><p>
<span>His dress shoes pounded the tiles. She turned. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her hair was much shorter than he remembered and cut in a stylish swooping bob. She was dressed in a dark skirt with a matching vest over a white shirt. But he would remember that face anywhere. </span>
</p><p>
<span>His mom kept a team photograph hidden in the office drawers. Growing up, he and his twin used to sneak looks at it when she was busy. It was a reminder of the years they spent on the road with the women’s professional baseball league. A reminder that it had really happened - no matter how his mom tried to pretend it didn’t. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry, do I know you?” She asked as she eyed him up and down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m William Maximoff.” He readjusted the book to one arm and extended his right hand. He saw a flicker of recognition. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maximoff?” She shook his hand gently. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I used to go by Billy. You played ball with my mother, Wanda.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blinked rapidly, and her skin seemed to pale as she squinted at him hard, “You were the twin?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes!! My brother Tommy! I knew it was you!” William had a distinct memory of watching Rio warm up before every game. She had such a unique pitching style. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow, I haven’t thought about the league in…years.” Rio stared off into the distance.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, my mom doesn’t like to talk about it either. I don’t know why. Those are some of my best childhood memories!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t believe you remember me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re pretty memorable. Can you wait just a sec? I need to drop off this delivery to the teacher in there. I’ll be right back.” He zipped into the lecture hall and handed over the book and papers to the professor who was packing up, then hustled back out, afraid that Rio might have left. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was waiting outside the class, fiddling with the strap of her cross body bag. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you busy? Do you want to get a coffee with me?” He asked. He was so eager to see someone from his past. It was like this forbidden secret in his house. He wanted to connect with those forgotten years in some way. Eddie would forgive him. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugged her shoulders, “I’ve got another class at one o’clock, but I can spare some time.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Great, want to go to The Unicorn?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lead the way.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They got a table in the back of the campus cafe. Rio ordered coffee and Billy got an espresso. She settled against the brick, “So how’d you end up at Harvard, kid?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was top of the class in my high school and got accepted. It's been nice to be on my own - away from Tommy. I’m studying Comparative Literature.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Literature? What are your plans after you graduate?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My dad named me after William Shakespeare, and I fell in love with his plays. I try to read everything I can get my hands on. I want to write my own book one day.” William had the starry-eyed optimism that only exists in the youth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, “Impressive. You’re so grown up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks, well what about you? Are you a student or…?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“PhD student.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My job offered to pay for my doctorate, so I jumped at the chance. Radcliffe has one the premier programs in biochemistry. I never thought I’d get in, but here I am. I have one more year to go.” Rio took a long drink. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you do exactly?” William sipped from his tiny cup and pretended he liked it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Medical research. I’ve worked at the CDC in Atlanta for the past five years on the development of vaccines. There’s always more to learn though.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Far out. That’s a long way from baseball. Do you talk to anyone from the ball club?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head, “No. Haven’t heard from anyone since. I played one more season after your mom retired. But then, I moved back to Florida and enrolled in school.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So you haven’t heard from Agatha?” William thought of Agatha a lot. She was the only one not in the team photograph, but she stuck out the most in his mind. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio spilled her coffee all over her shirt, “Damn!” She frantically tried to dab at it with a napkin. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Here, take mine.” He passed over his cloth napkin as she swiped up the drops from the table. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry, I just…haven’t heard that name in a while.” Her lips turned down in a sad frown. William could hear the melancholy tone in her voice. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I used to call her Aunt Aggie. I don’t know what happened. I was just a kid. It felt like losing a relative, and we didn’t have many to begin with. I’m sorry for bringing it up.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, you didn’t do anything wrong. I’m fine. I haven’t seen her since, umm…it’s been…” Rio looked down at the table in deep thought, “fifteen years.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Didn’t she used to live in Massachusetts?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Salem, yeah.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why don’t we try to find her?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What? Why would we do that?” Rio gave him a look like he was insane. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aren’t you curious?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve moved on. That was a lifetime ago. Look, it was nice to reminisce, but I need to go. I forgot my uh, my notebook in my apartment.” Rio stood abruptly. Her shirt was completely stained, her vest was disheveled. She looked overwhelmed as she made for the door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait! Can I get your number?” William didn’t want to lose her now. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed but held out her hand and motioned for a pen. He scrambled into his bag and pulled out a pencil. She scribbled her phone number onto a scrap of paper he had in his pocket. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“See ya, kid.” She said and was gone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>—---------</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was not okay. It was like someone had turned her world upside down.. She didn’t know how, but she made it back to her apartment in one piece. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She fell onto her bed and shoved her head into the pillow. </span>
</p><p>
<span>How could one name set her off? She was 41 years old for god's sake. She was at one of the top colleges in the nation. She had a beautiful, supportive family. She was successful in her career. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was happy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was meant to be happy. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>One mention of her and I’m a mess all over again. It’s pathetic. She hates me, remember? She’s never reached out. She’s never contacted me. She doesn’t care. I don’t care. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled off the bed and shuffled to the closet. She moved aside her winter clothes and searched the floor. Under two knitted blankets, she finally found her old travelling suitcase. The outside was well-worn, having been tossed around on many a bus trip, but the casing was strong and didn’t have a single dent. She yanked it out by the handle. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She pulled it on the floor and sat down with her back against her hope chest at the end of the bed. She clicked the latches and opened it for the first time in years. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her old cap was right on top. The green hat was like an old friend. Her uniform was folded beneath it. She could see all the stitches and repairs from the two years of wear. Her leather mitt looked lonely at the bottom. She put it on and opened and closed her hand, relishing the familiar feeling. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I miss baseball. I forgot how much I missed it.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The adrenaline rush was unlike anything else since. The pressure was everything. Rio punched into her glove and remembered the thrill of pitching in front of a crowd of thousands. She didn’t think anything else would ever compare. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The bottom of the case was littered with newspaper clippings about the Sallies and the Comets - their championship win in her rookie year, her perfect game, the play-off run in her second season. She dug through the unorganized mess in search of the thing she was trying to find. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Under a pennant flag, she found it. She pulled it out like a treasure hunter carefully extracting a chunk of gold. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was just as beautiful as she remembered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The photo of Agatha from LIFE magazine that she used to keep in her locker. The photo that had inspired it all. It was marked with folds and sun damaged, but her face was as stunning as ever. Rio ran her thumb along the cheek of the young Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had dated a few others over the years. It’s not like she had held a candle for her short-lived fling. There was an unfortunate obsession with an older, brunette professor in undergrad at the University of Florida that amounted to nothing but a crush. There was a drunken fling with her roommate senior year, which ended in the cold shoulder for the rest of the semester. Ouch. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a year-long something with Gloria, the hot statistician in the public health data department at work. It had been good until Gloria agreed to marry the boring engineer that promised her a backyard and a life that Rio could never provide. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought you had class all day?” Alice popped her head in. The law student was the best roommate - she mostly kept to herself and had a rad record collection. “Whoa, are you alright?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was sprawled on the floor, staring at the old photo of her long-lost lover. She was far from alright. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice stepped into the room, “What is all this stuff?” She picked up a photo of Rio pitching on the Sallies. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I used to play professional baseball in the ‘40s.” Rio rocked up to her knees and stood up. She started packing everything back up. Hidden where it belonged. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What the hell? You never told me that! I didn’t know women played pro ball.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The league only lasted nine years. It was during the war when the baseball owners lost all their best players to the draft. It took a global tragedy for them to finally take a chance on women’s sports.” Rio pocketed the photo of Agatha and piled the rest of the things in the suitcase. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Were you any good?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, “Yeah, I was.” She snapped the case closed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her life kept on rolling as it had been. The encounter with William had been a small detour, but she was back on track. She continued her research, attending her classes, and absolutely not admiring the photo of a certain someone every chance she got. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was about two weeks later that her phone rang on a Friday night. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We found her!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who is this?” She asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s William, of course. And Eddie, my boyf…my friend.” He stuttered over that last word. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you talking about?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha! I’ve been searching ever since we talked and Eddie’s been helping me. It’s been really fun.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shouldn’t you be studying or…wait, it’s Friday night, should you be out or something and not playing private investigator?” Looking at a picture was one thing. Rio didn’t feel ready to see the real Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t you want to hear what we found?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chewed the nail of her thumb. Before she could regret it she said, “Fine, out with it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, well the only thing I knew was her name and that she lived in Salem at some point. So last weekend we drove up there. It’s only 40 minutes away. First, we checked the phone book, but there was nobody listed under Harkness. Eddie suggested that maybe she got married.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt her stomach drop at the thought. Of course she would get married. She was the most beautiful woman Rio had ever known. There’s no chance that she was still single. </span>
</p><p>
<span>William continued, “So we went to the Salem Library and trawled the newspaper records for wedding announcements. Nothing! We must have stared at those papers for hours.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio released a heavy breath. Why did she care at all? Why did her body tense up at the thought of Agatha marrying someone?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eventually, we were going to throw in the towel. But, I decided to ask the librarian if she knew anyone with the last name Harkness. Salem is a pretty small town. She seemed to shiver at the mention, and then said ‘Good riddance’ and wouldn’t elaborate. Eddie checked the obituaries then and found a small mention in 1949 - the sudden death of an Evanora Harkness, survived by one daughter, Agatha.” William said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>So her mother died. That might explain why she didn’t come back to play the next season, but where was she now? </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio waited but couldn’t hear anything on the other end of the line, “Well, what happened to her?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I asked the librarian if she knew Agatha, but she said Agatha had left town after the funeral. Guess where she thought she moved?” He paused for dramatic effect. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not in a guessing mood, kid.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Boston!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you serious?” Rio felt sick. She’d lived in Cambridge for a year, and Agatha was twenty minutes away the entire time?? She would be lying if she said Radcliffe’s location in Massachusetts hadn’t played a small (or massive) role in her choice of university. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I checked the phonebook, and there is only one A.Harkness listed. 18 Fairfield Street in the Back Bay neighborhood. Do you want to come with us tomorrow?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her heart felt like it was ripping the skin of her chest to scream out “YES” but her head was infuriatingly more logical and realistic. Agatha had made her feelings crystal clear all those years ago. She wanted nothing to do with Rio then - why would she want to now?</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Billy, sorry William, I don’t think this is a good idea. You were too young to remember, but things didn’t end well for Agatha in the league. She probably doesn’t want to be reminded of that time. I think you should let this go.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Listen, you can talk to me about any questions you have, but let Agatha live her life. Trust me.” Rio tried to convey her seriousness. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He paused in frustration, “Fine, if you insist. Can we have coffee again soon?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure. Go enjoy your Friday night.” She hung up and knew immediately she wasn’t going to sleep well. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tossed and turned in bed. The sounds of Peter, Paul, and Mary blared from the record player in the living room as Alice entertained a selection of other stressed law students. She would normally mingle, but now her thoughts were an avalanche of Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She travelled deep into the cages she kept in the back of her mind. The memories that carried the warning “Be careful - will bite.” She unlocked the one filled with yearning and pure, intense heartache. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And then, she was crying. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Time hadn’t softened this wound as she’d simply pushed the hurt so far down into her subconscious that she hadn’t processed a moment. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes burned as she remembered their whirlwind meeting, their rivalry, their first and last kiss, the unexpected end to it all. Her nose started to run embarrassingly as the tears stained her pillow. She was too old to be crying over an ex. She wasn’t even an ex! They weren’t girlfriends, they weren’t married. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was like a camera flash - she burned as bright as the sun and disappeared with the blink of an eye.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>The clock on the wall ticked past midnight. Rio was meant to work on her dissertation this weekend. After another fifteen minutes, she gave up and clicked on the bedside lamp. She knew who she needed to call. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hello?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jen, I can’t sleep.” Rio muttered through the phone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio? It’s midnight, you’re so lucky that I’m working the night shift this week.” Jen was a midwife at a large hospital in Brooklyn. She’d moved out of Florida after finishing her medical training and was thriving in the big city. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I knew you’d be awake. I need your sage advice.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What woman is terrorizing you now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wh-what are you talking about?” Rio sputtered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on, you only call me this late when you have girl problems.” Jen laughed at the obvious observation. She’d counselled Rio through a conveyor belt of beautiful but ill-suited suitors. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I guess you’re right. Well, at least this isn’t a new one…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who? Please don’t say Beverley. She was such an evil bit-”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio cut her off and blurted out, “Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nooooo. Rio, not again. That girl broke your damn heart into pieces. No, she didn’t just break it. She ripped it out, stomped on it with her spikes, tossed it in the air, smacked it with her bat, and sent it over the outfield fences.” Jen certainly knew how to paint a pretty picture. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s in Boston.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How do you know that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uhhh, long story.” Rio didn’t have the energy to recount the Billy story. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have you seen her?” Jen asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then don’t. She left. She was cruel. She never came looking for you, did she?” Jen remembered all too well when Agatha had broken Rio’s heart. The Comets won the championship, but it didn’t even register for Rio. Jen was the one who wiped her tears, the one who helped pack up her bags, who rode with her back home, who nursed her back to life after weeks of catatonia at her aunt and uncle's home. </span>
</p><p>
<span>If nothing else, it showed Jen how much she enjoyed taking care of others and inspired her career change. But it had been awful to watch Rio struggle to regain her confidence and feel worthy of love again. She wasn’t actually sure if her friend had ever fully recovered. She seemed to push every potential lover away as soon as things got too serious. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There are some heartbreaks that never leave you. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What if I just go see her once?” Rio bargained. She couldn’t get the idea out of her head. Agatha was so close. It seemed crazy not to go see her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, we’re in our 40’s. You don’t need my permission, you know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So it’s not a terrible idea?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t say that. I personally think it would be catastrophically awful, but I know you. If you’ve gotten it in your obsessive little head that you need to do this, then you need to do it. Can you promise me something though?” Jen asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Depends.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Promise me you won’t get your hopes up. She might not even want to see you. She might flat out refuse. She might throw a drink in your face. She might yell or scream or tell you to fuck off.” Jen knew she’d be the one to deal with the fall out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know. I don’t think she’ll want to pick things up again with me. She’s probably dating some guy named Greg and is the head of her neighborhood watch or some other domestic bullshit.” Rio had no clue what Agatha could possibly be doing now. She could only imagine the hardcore, take-no-prisoners catcher from her memories. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I expect a phone call update as soon as possible.” Jen said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course. Goodnight, Jen. Thanks as always.” Rio hung up. Her research could wait. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was going to Boston tomorrow. </span>

<span>Morning crept up on her, and Rio rolled out of bed with a groan. She glanced at herself in the mirror and cringed. She looked even more tired than she felt - not exactly the way she wanted to present herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alice!!” She raised her voice and heard her roommate walk over from the dining room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can you help me with my makeup?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice leapt into the air in the doorway, “I thought you’d never ask! Come to the bathroom, I’ll get my stuff.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Half an hour and an extensive amount of eyeliner later, Rio admired the final product. Alice had a real artist’s eye, and Rio looked way cooler than she felt. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s the occasion?” Alice asked. Rio rarely cared much about stuff like this. She’d never seen her roommate go out on a date or bring anyone home. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio fussed with her bangs, “Seeing an old friend.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“An old flame?” Alice teased. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Things didn’t end on a good note.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ohhhh, so you want to show him what he missed out on? Let me pick your outfit.” Alice walked to her closet and searched the rack. She loved to collect coats and jackets. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, it’s not like that. I just want to look…confident.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about this?” Alice held up a dark red sleeveless sheath dress. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The corners of Rio’s mouth curved up on sight. She nodded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know what would look killer with this.” Alice flipped through her clothes until she landed on what she was looking for. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She pulled out the black leather greaser jacket. Rio had always eyed the piece with envy. She put it on and loved the feeling immediately. She felt strong. “Thanks, Alice.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“This guy would be crazy not to come crawling back once he sees you.” Alice ogled her friend. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wasn’t about to explain that it wasn’t a man she was going to see, “Can I borrow your car?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice tossed her the keys with a smile, “Go get’em, tiger.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio checked the map a few times and plotted the course to Back Bay. There wasn’t much traffic this early in the morning. The city sang with early risers and the promise of a new day. Rio bathed in the sunrise and drove with the windows down. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>If nothing else, I just want to see her again. Even if she doesn’t want to talk to me, I just want to see her face one more time. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She hadn’t planned what she was going to say or what she even wanted out of this. All she wanted was some indication that Agatha existed. That she hadn’t imagined it all. She had disappeared from her life in a snap. Rio wanted some closure. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The tree-lined streets felt like something from a different time. The buildings were all historic, built in the 19th century, and incredibly well-preserved.</span>
</p><p>
<span>The car pulled up in front of the address that William had given - 18 Fairfield Road. Rio checked the number twice. This couldn’t be right, could it? The brick townhouse looked like a house a Kennedy would live in, not a single woman from Salem. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>This was a mistake. She’s married. Definitely married. What was I thinking?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Rio parked along the curb and sat in the car staring out the window at the house. She couldn’t do this. She imagined ringing the door and some guy opening it. What would she say? How would she explain who she was and how she knew Agatha? </span>
</p><p>
<span>She sighed and shook her head. </span>
<em>
<span>I should just go back to school. I don’t need this stress. </span>
</em>
<span>She turned the keys in the ignition and felt the engine stutter to life again. As she began to shift into drive, a man and woman walked right past the car and up the steps to the house that supposedly belonged to Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio paused. She recognized that face, even with the grey streaks in her hair. She unclipped her seatbelt and jumped out of the car. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Peggy?” She called out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman on the steps turned right before knocking on the door. She looked down to the street and shaded her eyes to get a better view. It took a moment. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?” Peggy skipped down and rushed over to her old teammate. “Is that you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s me. What are you doing here?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are </span>
<em>
<span>you </span>
</em>
<span>doing here?” Peggy’s eyes flicked up to the house. The man she was with was casually leaning against the iron railing, watching with interest. He was holding a bouquet of beautiful wildflowers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ummm, I don’t know. I thought this was Agatha’s house.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think you should go.” Peggy said firmly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is this her house?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t think she would want to see you. I’m sorry. I don’t know why you’re here. I don’t know what you want, but she’s finally in a good place. She’s finally doing well. I don’t want anything to mess that up.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I…I…” Rio stuttered. She was so close. She had waited years for this. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They heard conversation behind them. A man’s voice and a woman’s greeting. They exchanged a few words and then a voice hollered towards them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Peg! What are you-” </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Crash</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>The sound of glass shattering made everyone on the street turn. Agatha was standing in her doorway. The vase she was holding was now a broken collection of glass at her feet, the flowers lying in wake down the steps. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio peered behind Peggy and saw Agatha staring straight at her. Their eyes locked. She felt like a wild bull being lassoed by a cowboy. Agatha’s eyes were reining her in and constricting around her, cutting off her breathing, cutting off all other thoughts.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, butterfingers.” Rio smirked and waved. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>Agatha was frozen. Her foot was bleeding. Glass was covering her entire landing stoop. And she didn’t care. She couldn’t care about anything. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was here. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“ARRHGHHH!!” Agatha flew down to the street ready to pounce. Her arm was raised to strike before Peggy held her back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“NO! Agatha calm down!” Peggy shouted, wrapping her arms around Agatha to steady her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why are you here?!” She spat, almost screaming in the street, forgetting all semblance of propriety. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe we should go inside…” Peggy suggested as the neighbors started to whisper and stare. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t want her in my house.” Agatha shook her head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They were at an impasse. Everyone stared at each other. Rio was the first to break the silence, “I’ll go. I’m sorry.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha enjoyed the hollow victory. She didn’t say goodbye. She turned and asked Steve to help her back into the house. She went to grab the broom from the hallway closet. As she came back out, she saw Peggy still talking to the unwelcome visitor. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Eventually, the car started, and Rio was gone. Agatha finally released the breath that sat in her lungs. </span>
<em>
<span>How could she still harbor this anger after all this time? How could she still affect her like this?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy walked up and grabbed the dustpan. She held it as Agatha swept the pieces up. Steve gathered the flowers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you want to-” Peggy began to speak but Agatha made a noise of protest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s just go to breakfast like we planned.” She sighed and went to find another vase inside. </span>
</p><p>
<span>At the Parisian Coffee House, they sat at their regular table near the pastry case. Agatha was uncharacteristically quiet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A waitress poured some coffee in each of their mugs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay come on, tell me you’re not at least a little curious?” Peggy threw her hands up. She couldn’t believe Agatha was acting like this. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t want to talk about her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s been fifteen years!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And?” Agatha couldn’t process what was happening. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s studying at Radcliffe. I always knew she was athletic, but she’s got brains too? Clearly God has favorites.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Radcliffe. She lives minutes away. Minutes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wasn’t she the pitcher on the Comets?” Steve asked innocently - feeling lost in the subtext. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can we talk about literally anything else?” Agatha dove into the menu despite knowing she was just going to order her usual - pancake stack with a side of hash browns. The coveted carbs on carbs way to start the day. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No way! I’ve let you ignore this part of our past for long enough. Time to grow up.” Peggy said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let her head drop to the table dramatically. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ready to order?” The waitress followed the unwritten service rule - always show up at the most inconvenient time possible. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They placed their breakfast orders and sat in an awkward silence as Peggy stared at Agatha, waiting for her friend to give in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Steve busied himself stacking the sugar packets on the table. He had been around these two long enough to know not to get involved. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“FINE!” Agatha finally broke. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy grinned devilishly, “She gave me her number. I think she just genuinely wants to talk to you. She seemed just as shocked to see you, like she didn’t expect it.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What could we possibly have to talk about? She broke whatever we had, and I have no desire to reminisce or relive the good ol’ days with her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“She looked good though, right?” Peggy knew that would get a reaction. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt heat start to rise to her face. She wasn’t blind. Rio was somehow more gorgeous today than she was over a decade ago. It really wasn’t fair. She blurted out, “Stop.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know that the coach would have pulled you from the game anyway. You can’t keep holding Rio responsible for that one decision. Any other pitcher would have made that same call.” Peggy explained.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t untie her feelings for Rio, the pain of the injury, the hurt of the betrayal, and the end of her baseball career. It was a jumbled spaghetti mess of steaming hot emotions. There was no rationality or logic. It was chaotic, temperamental dynamite. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know that. I can know that’s true and still have trouble accepting it.” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe it’d help to meet up with her. You don’t owe her anything, but I think you owe yourself something.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If I say yes, will you shut up about this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes.” Peggy handed over the ten digit number smugly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No promises. I probably scared her away today anyway. Now, tell me how the kids are doing.”</span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>Agatha let Rio’s number decay on the kitchen counter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She eyed it when she cooked dinner that night. She monitored it when she got a glass of water before bed. It haunted her in the morning when she heated up some oatmeal for breakfast. She finally had to move it under the fruit bowl during lunch as she sat at the dining room table doing some essay grading. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The house was suffocating. For the past few months, the walls felt like they were too tall, too foreign. She hated the emptiness, the unending emptiness. She’d run away from this before, and the urge to up and run still pulsed through her veins. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pushed the fruit bowl aside and yanked the number out. She stomped to the phone in the living room and dialled her one-time enemy / part-time lover. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, speaking.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>That voice slashed through her defenses. She felt like a lovesick ballplayer again, “Hey.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha.” She spoke her name like a devotion. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t think you’d call.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Neither did I.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They didn’t speak for a few seconds, content to just listen to the other’s breathing alone. Rio’s curiosity got the better of her, “How have you been?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed at the absurdity of the question. How could she capture fifteen years of her life in a single response? She went with the stock standard, “Good, how about you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled too. They were playing pretend. “Good. I missed you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hated you.” Agatha didn’t want to keep up the facade anymore. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Past tense?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Huh?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t hate me anymore?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know you anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know me.” Rio asserted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t know me.” Agatha confessed. A lot had changed. She wasn’t the same person that had fallen head over heels for a cocky pitcher in the heat of the summer. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want to.” Rio said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Want to what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want to know you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart thawed slightly - the dripping shards ached in her chest. Rio always had the words that made her melt. She hesitated and murmured,  “What if you don’t like what you find?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let me take you to dinner.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please, one dinner.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“One dinner. Then you let me go.” Agatha relented. She was already preparing for the inevitable ending. She didn’t have any hopes left to get up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Friday night? Can I pick you up at 6?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Friday at 6. See you then.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Bye, Agatha.” The line went dead. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>Work dragged that week. Agatha felt every minute of her classes. The impending date (was it a date?) weighed heavy on her shoulders. She could feel her energy waning by Wednesday. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ms. Harkness? You forgot to pass out the worksheet.” Ann, the class brown noser, raised her hand yet spoke aloud anyway. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, sorry. Take one, pass it along.” She handed the stack to the student in the front row and returned to her desk.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>I should call Rio and cancel. This was a mistake. Yeah, I’ll call her tonight and cancel. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She finished the day and went home to change before heading to Peggy’s for dinner. She typically visited her friend’s house at least once a week when she couldn’t be bothered cooking. The Rogers house was only one block over on Exeter Street. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She walked straight in the door to their 19th century brownstone that was similar to her own. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom! Aunt Agatha is here!” Sandra yelled from her spot on the couch. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy popped out from the kitchen, “Hey doll, we’re having pot roast.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Perfect, do you need help?” Agatha asked as she stepped out of her pumps. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I could just use some company.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I’m good for that. Where’s JJ?” Agatha looked around for Peggy’s eldest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s out with some of the other boys from the baseball team.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ohh, little bird is flying the nest!” Agatha tried to keep an eye on the boy at school. He was in his first year of high school, and she saw him around the halls. He was small for his age, but it looked like he had inherited his mom’s athletic ability. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t remind me. I don’t know how I’m going to deal with him leaving for college. I’m dreading the day already.” Peggy checked the oven, and the smell made Agatha’s mouth water. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So…you know how we saw Rio the other day…” Agatha started. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy snapped to standing and whipped around, “Oh my god, did you call her?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes. We’re going to dinner on Friday.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I would kill to be a fly on the wall for that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What? Don’t be weird.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’d be even better than the Dick Van Dyke or Andy Griffith Show! Two former rivals, who became…” Peggy mouthed the word ‘lovers’ to avoid her daughter overhearing, “Then, were separated for years and years and are now reuniting. It practically writes itself! I’d watch the hell out of that show.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was going to cancel.” Agatha said, nervously running a hand through her hair. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No!! I need this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>You</span>
</em>
<span> need this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m so bored, Agatha. If I have to attend one more parent’s bingo fundraiser, I think I will throw myself into the river. I need some exciting gossip in my life again.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You should get a job.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who’s gonna hire a housewife? It’s not like we need the money. Steve makes more than enough.” She was proud of her husband, who was a successful artist. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Things are changing, Peg. Women are getting all sorts of jobs these days. One of my student’s mothers works for the police department! Remember when you wanted to be a detective one day?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Really?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why not? You could do anything you want. You’re brilliant.” Agatha knew that Peggy was struggling with a sense of purpose lately. She wanted her to pursue whatever goal she had. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The timer went off, and Peggy pulled the huge roasting tray out of the oven. It looked divine. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright. Sandra!” She yelled out, “Set the table, please!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, Peggy placed the roast down and turned to Agatha, “Go help the kid, and then we’ll eat. And you will not under any circumstance cancel your dinner with Rio. Got it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha saluted her. Peggy would have made a hell of a drill sergeant in another life. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>Rio let Alice do her makeup again. She went to Filene’s in the city and bought a brand-new outfit. She decided to go with tight grey plaid tapered pants and a complimentary black sleeveless turtleneck sweater.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Careful the smoke alarm doesn’t go off because you look flaming hot, Rio!” Alice whistled low as she took in the entire outfit and look. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s that saying…” Rio began as she twirled in the mirror and admired the view. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dress to impress?” Alice guessed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled widely. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was about to show Agatha what she had missed out on, “No, revenge is a dish best served cold.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She pulled up outside Agatha’s house five minutes early in Alice’s sleek black ‘56 Dodge Lancer. The clear sky was painted in reds and pinks as the sun began to set. A light breeze rustled her hair as Rio walked up the steps and knocked on the door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The white wooden door swung open. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There she was. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was in front of her. She was a vision in a shirt-waist green striped dress. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t know how she was more enticing now in her 50s than she had been in her 30s. The fullness of her face had subsided, and her hair was styled in the popular bouffant that most women preferred these days. There were more wrinkles around her eyes, her mouth, her neck. Based on what the magazines said, that should add up to a woman leaving her prime. But despite the sexist beauty standards, Agatha was as radiant as ever. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow, Agatha. You look…you look so beautiful.” Rio felt starstruck. She forgot every sarcastic joke and cutting barb. All she could remember was why she had fallen for this gal in the first place. Damn it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes wandered up and down Rio’s body, “How do you still look like this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ah, there was still something there. “Good genetics, I suppose.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Still as humble as ever I see.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Some things never change.” Rio offered a hand to help Agatha down the stairs. The older woman ignored it and led the way on her own. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Suppose they don’t.” Rio said to herself and hustled to catch up as Agatha was already opening the passenger seat and getting in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is this your car?” She asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“My roommate’s.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Knew it was too nifty for you. Where are you taking me anyway?” Agatha sat her purse in her lap and rolled down the window. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio started the car, “Cantina Italiana. Have you ever been?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can’t say I have.” Agatha looked over and saw Rio staring at her, blatantly admiring her profile. “Enjoying the view?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry, yup. Let’s go.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So, um, how long have you been at Radcliffe?” Agatha asked, trying to keep the conversation light as they exited her neighborhood. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is my second year. How long have you lived in Boston?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I lived in Salem for a year after my last season. My mom died the following year, and I was stuck dealing with her estate for another year. I got so sick of that town. I sold my house and moved in 1950. So I’ve been here for about 13 years.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry about your mom.” Rio said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not. She left this complicated will for me. One final fuck you from beyond the grave. I couldn’t even find peace with her death. It’s like she was still hovering behind me, laughing.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry…” Rio didn’t know what else there was to say. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t need your sympathy.” Agatha snapped then shook her head, “I mean, thanks. Sorry, it’s just…strange. Being here with you. After everything that happened.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I get it.” Rio knew that Agatha probably didn’t even want to be here. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They arrived at Hanover St, and Rio parallelled parked. The host sat them at a quiet table near the back of the restaurant. It was busy and all the surrounding tables were full of other couples or groups. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio picked up the menu and started scanning the offerings, but Agatha just stared at her, “Rio, what are we doing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Having dinner?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Obviously. I mean, what are you doing here? How did you find me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio folded the menu back up and set it down. Okay, they were jumping straight into the deep end. “Do you remember Billy?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re gonna have to be a lot more specific.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wanda’s son.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyebrows raised in surprise, “Billy and Tommy.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah. Well Billy…he goes by William now…goes to Harvard. He recognized me out of nowhere a few weeks ago.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No kidding. He’s in college now?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s 20, if you can believe it. Anyway, he saw me and was so desperate to talk to someone about the league. Apparently, Wanda is very hush hush about it all. He asked about you.” Rio explained. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Does he know what happened?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No. His memory seems very limited. It’s thanks to him that I'm here at all. He’s the one who went to Salem, found out you had moved to Boston, and then found your address. The kid’s got a one-track mind. I had to beg him not to come surprise you. I decided to do that instead.” Rio smiled and Agatha returned it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t believe you’re here. For years, I thought about what I would do if I saw you again. Punch you, push you down some stairs, run you over with a car…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah old classics.” Rio joked, “Are there no new options?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s like I built you up in my mind as this evil villain. But sitting here, I can only see the girl that can throw the best fastball I’ve ever seen.” Agatha’s face softened as she stared at Rio’s big brown eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m so sorry for that last game. That guilt has been a thorn in my side this whole time. I really didn’t want to do that.” Rio tried to explain their final moments together. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You did the right thing. The team wouldn’t have won if I attempted to keep playing. It would have been a fool’s errand. I know that now. I just couldn’t understand that then.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Is your knee okay?” Rio asked curiously. She hadn’t noticed a limp or anything. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I had surgery on it. It’s a little weak, especially in the winter, but mostly fine.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The waiter appeared beside the table, “Are you two ready?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked up flustered, “Sorry, we haven’t looked at the menu yet. Can you give us a minute?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Take your time.” He said and walked away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s good here?” Agatha reached into her bag and pulled out some oversized cat's eye glasses to examine the menu. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The pappardelle is top tier. Or, the chicken parmigiana is a classic.” Rio recommended. She looked up and had to control her reaction because the image of Agatha in glasses was doing something for her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ordered the ragu pasta and Rio took a chance on the fish of the day. The waiter brought out a basket of bread and some fresh water. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio buttered a piece of bread and decided to ask the main question on her mind, “Agatha, I know it’s none of my business, but I was just wondering…are you single?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shifted in her seat, “Yes. Are you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes. I haven’t had much luck in the dating pool.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was married.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hands stilled - the butter knife pausing mid swipe on the bread. She looked up, across the table, Agatha was fussing over the indent on her ring finger that was noticeably empty. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She continued, “His name was Jimmy. We met at teacher’s college. He was a few years older and re-training after serving in the military. He was nice. He was safe. He came from a very wealthy Boston family but wanted to make his own way in the world. We got married in ‘51 and moved into the house not long after. We both worked at Excel High. He taught science, and I taught history. I mean, I still teach history.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What happened to him?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Heart attack in ‘59. Killed him before he could even call for help. I found him on the floor of the bedroom when I woke up. He must have gotten up to go to the bathroom and…and he was laying there…all night.” Agatha’s voice shook with the grit of sadness. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh no, that’s terrible. I’m sorry for your loss.” Rio was shocked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lifted her cloth napkin to dab at her eyes, “I’m grateful for the time we had together. I learned a lot about how to be a good partner, how to care for another, how to care for myself. I think he toned down my sharp edges.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I liked your sharp edges.” Rio admitted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lifted a brow, “I think you were the only one.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tried to turn the conversation to a less depressing place, “so, what I’m also hearing is that you listened to my advice.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What advice?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You became a teacher. Just like I suggested.” Rio said with a smug smile. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, “Maybe I was planning to do it anyway.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You could just admit I was right. I knew you’d be a good teacher.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who said I was any good? I could be the world’s worst teacher for all you know.” Agatha ripped off a piece of bread and threw it into her mouth. She had that cheeky twinkle in her eye that Rio had missed so much.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I doubt that.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about you? What are you studying at that fancy pant’s college anyway? Aren’t you a bit old to still be in school?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a sip of water and almost choked with laughter, “I’m doing my doctorate, excuse you. I’m researching streptococcus pneumoniae transmission and colonization in young children, specifically the bacteria virulence and current treatment options.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dumb that down for a lowly high school teacher?” Agatha stared at her slack-jawed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“My hope is that my work will aid the development of a vaccine in the future that can protect against several strains of pneumococcal, which can cause pneumonia and meningitis.”  Rio explained. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s voice caught in her throat. Her eyes welled up immediately again, “Pneumonia…like what - what killed Nicky?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, maintaining eye contact as Agatha visibly started falling apart at the realization. She had been trying to cheer her up and now she was breaking apart, “And one of my cousins. Pascal. He got sick when he was 11, and it took him. I was so sick of losing people to illness. I applied for the University of Florida that summer and was accepted.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was trying to maintain her composure, wiping her eyes and nose and trying to listen to what Rio was saying. “I can’t believe that you…” She couldn’t finish. Her voice wouldn’t come. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve had enough heartache for a lifetime, I think.” Rio said. She hadn’t gone into this career because of Agatha, per se, but it had helped her decide. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood abruptly, forcing the wooden seat to screech behind her, “I have to go. I’m sorry!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait, our food…” Rio stood, but Agatha was already putting on her coat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll call you.” She said as the tears continued to fall from her sparkling blue eyes. “I promise. I just…I need to get out of here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can drive you.” Rio sputtered, not wanting this night to end. </span>
<em>
<span>Fuck, I shouldn’t have brought up Nicky. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I’ll get a taxi.” She threw down a ten dollar bill in a rush. “I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>And not for the first time, Rio watched the woman she loved run away.</span>

<p>
<span>“It was the dream of a lifetime. Today when I sign a baseball card for kids, I write on it, ‘Follow your dreams.’ And I tell ’em, ‘Do not let anyone tell you that you can’t fulfill that dream.’ I love baseball so much. And that was my dream. . . . My knees are shot and my hips are shot today, but when you get the dream of a lifetime fulfilled, you’re never sorry. . . . I’d do it again in a heartbeat if I could.”</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>Sarah Jane Sands</span>
</p>
</blockquote><p>
<span>Rio waited. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And waited. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And waited. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The call never came. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She debated calling and apologizing. She agonized over it but decided that Agatha needed to be the one to chase her this time. She couldn’t keep pursuing someone who didn’t want to be pursued. </span>
</p><p>
<span>During spring break, she decided to stay on campus. There was still so much work to do, and she wanted to save money. Flights to Florida weren’t cheap. </span>
</p><p>
<span>William found her one afternoon as she was laying on the grass, reading, in the park near her apartment. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio! Hey!” He skipped over. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She sat up on her blanket, “Hi William.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I keep thinking about Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>You’re not the only one.</span>
</em>
<span> Rio thought. Instead she said, “I went to see her.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What? When?” He looked at her like she had just insulted his favorite shoes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tried to hide behind her book, “The address was correct. But, I still don’t think you should see her. She doesn’t want to talk about the past.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t believe you went without me!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha and I have a…complicated history, kid.” Rio frowned. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you talk about me?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I mentioned you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What else did you want me to say? I barely know you.” Rio said. They weren’t exactly close friends.</span>
</p><p>
<span>William’s face fell, “I don’t know…if you talk to her again, can you just tell her I want to see her too?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio moved to stand up and smoothed out her skirt, “I don’t think there is going to be a next time unfortunately.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh...” William helped Rio fold her blanket. He could see the pain in her features even as she tried to put on a mask that she was okay. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, thanks for your help finding her though. I never would have looked if it wasn’t for you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No problem. I’ll see you around, Rio.” He waved goodbye, looking like he was already planning something. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>The invitation arrived a few days before the second weekend in April. Rio held the thick card stock and read the looping script. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>You’re invited to the Back Bay Yacht Club Annual Easter Jamboree</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Sunday April 14th at 12pm. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Door prizes, open bar, and light refreshments provided. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>What the hell? Rio had no idea who sent this. She only knew one person who lived in that neighborhood, but surely this wasn’t from Agatha. Her mind went to the only other meddling nuisance who might have arranged this. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He picked up on the first ring, “Hello?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“William, why have I been invited to a yacht club jamboree? What even is a jamboree?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good, you got it. I was wondering when you’d call.” He sounded jolly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You didn’t answer the question.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You said you thought that you wouldn’t see Agatha again, so I rewrote that reality.” He said like that was a normal thing that people did. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What does that mean?” Rio yelled into the phone. She remembered now why she tried to limit interactions with undergrads at all costs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This guy in my poetry class lives in Back Bay and was talking about how his mom organizes the annual easter party at the yacht club. Everyone who’s anyone goes to this thing. I asked if he knew Agatha, and apparently she always goes every year with the Rogers family. I offered to do his next two assignments if he could swindle me an invitation.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You what?!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey it worked, didn’t it? That invite includes a plus one, so you’re taking me.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This has ‘bad idea’ written all over it.” Rio rubbed her temples with her free hand, she could feel the headache starting already. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>The yacht club looked as posh and ostentatious as she expected. Rio adjusted the skirt of her borrowed flower-sprayed, bright blue dress with rippling taffeta and an audacious dahlia along the belt line. One of the sorority girls who lived next door lent it to her. She looked like some trophy wife out of </span>
<em>
<span>Leave it to Beaver </span>
</em>
<span>and felt ridiculous. </span>
</p><p>
<span>William looked dapper in a plaid sport coat and flannel slacks. He slicked his curls down into a neater crop and wore a pastel tie for the festive occasion. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why did I let you talk me into this?” Rio muttered out of the side of her mouth as they lined up with all the other Boston elite outside the entrance. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She can’t ignore us without causing a scene. It’s the perfect trap.” William explained again. He knew that Agatha could run from phone calls and knocks on her door, but if they got her in public, she’d have to face them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He’d recently talked to his mom on the phone and asked about Agatha again. She’d conveniently changed the subject and disregarded any further attempts to bring it up. He was so curious about what could have happened between them.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>The line inched forward slowly. The women sitting at the desk outside the door were meticulously checking each invite. They must have frequent gate crashers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When they got to the front, the beautiful blonde extended her white-gloved hand, “Invitation?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio handed it over with a fake smile. The blonde eyed both Rio and William with the steely glare of a judgemental bully. They were very obviously different from the rest of the folks here, but their invite was legitimate. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you two new in town?” She asked with a sinister tone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>William saw Rio open her mouth and jumped in, “My mother is a generous donor. I’m studying at Harvard, and she suggested I attend with my cousin in her place.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio noticed the way the women immediately seemed to relax at the mention of the prestigious school. The blonde spoke and waved them in, “Oh how sweet. Please, enjoy your visit.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Smooth.” Rio said as they walked through the open double doors. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They walked down a red carpeted hallway towards the sound of a live band. “Remember the plan. Find Agatha. Don’t let her get away.” He said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not going to tackle her to the ground if she tries to run.” Rio replied. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hopefully it doesn’t come to that.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The main function space had wall to wall windows overlooking the harbor. The building sat right over the water on prime real estate. The who’s who of Boston mingled around high cocktail tables as a swinging jazz quartet entertained on the stage. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio scanned the room but couldn’t see any familiar figures. “She’s not here yet. I’m getting a drink.” She walked to the bar. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Gin and tonic.” She ordered quickly, leaning against the bartop. William ordered a beer. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?” The bartender asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Darcy? Far out, what are you doing here?” She never expected to see one of her classmates in a place like this. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I work here on weekends to help pay the rent. I barely recognized you. Why are you hanging out with these squares?” Darcy asked quietly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio paused. She didn’t have a good explanation, so she went with William’s story, “My cousin asked me to come. It’s such a drag.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tell me about it. You’d think with all this dough, these people would be better tippers.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They giggled together. Rio turned and saw Peggy walking in with her husband and two teens, which must mean…</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha strolled into the space in a marvellous violet dress with emerald green accents across the print. The pleated skirt flowed around her legs while the short sleeve top hugged her curves just right. She had on a pearl necklace and matching earrings. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt weak at the knees. She downed her entire drink in one go. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait for me!” William bleated out as Rio made a beeline straight for her target. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was greeting people left and right when her eyes caught someone stomping right at her. Rio saw her eyes widen, and she turned at once. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey!” Rio called as Agatha cut back down the entry hall. She looked over her shoulder and picked up her pace. Rio refrained from sprinting but walked as fast as possible to get to her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She watched Agatha slip into the ladies room. “Wait out here.” Rio told William, then went in. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was no sign of her at the sinks. All the stalls were empty but one. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha! I know you’re in here.” Rio announced to the room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No I’m not.” She called back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This wasn’t my idea.” Rio hoped that would reassure her. “It’s the kid. He wants to see you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The stall door opened and she walked out. “Billy?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s outside. He came up with this whole plan and got us into this party. He’s too smart for his own good, I swear.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I never called.” Agatha confessed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know.” Rio was used to waiting for things that never came. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I wanted to.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Look, can you just go out there and talk to this kid so he can get whatever this is out of his system?” Rio pointed to the door.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, “Can you come with me? I don’t know if I can do it alone.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“After you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>They emerged from the bathroom and William was leaning against the wall. “Oh my gosh. Hi, Agatha, or uhh Miss Harkness. I know it’s been a long time, but I’ve been dying to talk to you. I’m so excited. Wow. I can’t believe you’re really here!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Take a chill pill there, Mr. Motormouth.” Agatha felt overwhelmed at the sight of him.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry! Sorry! I’ve thought about this for a long time.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why don’t we sit? Looks like there’s an empty room over there.” Rio saw a small office that appeared unoccupied near the staircase. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They sat in plush chairs, and Rio took the office chair behind the desk in the room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Right, why do you want to talk to me so badly? What questions do you have for your mother’s ex…” Agatha paused, causing Rio to look at her incredulously, “best friend?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>He looked slightly dejected at the harsh tone but was undeterred, “Why didn’t you come visit us? I mean after the league. If you were best friends with my mom, why did we never see you again?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed and leaned back in the chair, “It’s hard to explain. I had a lot going on in my life at that time. I wish I could have seen you boys. Really I do.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Then why didn’t you? I thought of you like…like family.” William said. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry, Billy. It wasn’t my choice. Your mom…she didn’t want me around.” Agatha tried to explain. Rio saw the painful memory sitting on her tense shoulders. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“But why?” He pushed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“William.” Rio said his name in warning. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, he should know.” Agatha said to Rio, then turned to the boy. “She didn’t want me around you because she found out that Rio and I were seeing each other.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Seeing each other?” He asked, eyes narrowed in confusion, flicking between both of them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dating! We were dating!” She threw her hands up in the air, exasperated. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ohhhhhh. Oh wow, wow, wow, wow”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You sound like a scratched record. Are you alright?” Agatha braced for the inevitable hurt that she expected. </span>
</p><p>
<span>William laughed. He shook his head and laughed hard as the two women in the room just stared at him like he was a zoo animal. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s so funny?” Agatha finally asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m dating my friend…Eddie.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>They all looked at each other and suddenly, everyone in the room was overcome with contagious laughter. The experience of a shared hidden secret was unexplainably funny as their laughs shook their bodies. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When they calmed down enough to speak, Rio sat up and asked, “Does your mom know?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Definitely not, and this conversation hasn’t done much to allay any fears I had about that.” William crossed his arms and ran a hand over his hair. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was years and years ago. I’m sure your mom has changed. You’re her son, she’ll love you regardless.” Agatha offered. She knew that wasn’t true of her own mother, but maybe this kid was luckier. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s coming in a few weeks to visit. It’s parent’s weekend on campus. I was going to tell her then.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good luck.” Agatha said, “Well, this has been a grand little reunion, but there are fresh oysters out there calling my name so…” She slapped her hands against her thighs and moved to stand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How come you and Rio broke up?” He asked and watched as Agatha slowly lowered herself back down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart picked up. She watched Agatha chewing her lip and thinking carefully about how to answer. Rio decided to end her misery, “It’s not easy to live this life. It was even harder back then. Sometimes other things get in the way of love.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s blue eyes sparkled as it looked like she was struggling to control her breathing. William continued to let his curiosity lead. He’d never met any queer adults in his life, “You were in love?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes.” Rio answered. She was too old to deny her emotions and her past any longer. “I’ve never loved anyone like I loved Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She watched the other women swipe at her cheeks as her mascara started to run. William passed her a handkerchief from his jacket pocket. “That’s beautiful.” He admired with a sad smile. The air sat thick in the confined space. Tension crackled between them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh, I’m pretty thirsty. I’ll be right back.” William could take the hint that it was time for him to leave. He walked out and left the two women alone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio moved from behind the desk and took the boy’s seat next to Agatha. She was sniffing softly and looking out the lone window in the room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t pretend it’s not true.” Rio said, which caught her attention and forced her to turn and face her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Even after how I left you? Even after what I said?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was mad for a long time. Pissed off at how you could just walk away like that. I thought we had something…special. It was special for me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you think it wasn’t for me?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know what it was for you! Was I just some experiment? A huge regret in the scheme of your life? You’ve never told me how you feel about any of it!” Rio’s voice raised uncontrollably. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You ruined me!” Agatha yelled in response. Her hands gripping the arms of the chair like they might keep her grounded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Rio’s voice shrunk as the words smacked her hard. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha threw herself up and paced the room, “I thought marrying a man would put all these feelings to rest. He was a good husband - a great one by most standards. And it didn’t matter. None of it mattered! There wasn’t a day that passed where I wasn’t comparing him to you!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio could feel each breath circulating through her lungs. Time slowed for her. Finally, there was confirmation she’d wished for. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was all tumbling out of Agatha now - the dam had broken, “I felt your lips when he kissed me. I thought about you every time he laid next to me in bed. I imagined it was you at the altar when I said ‘I Do.’ You ruined me for anyone else.” Agatha pointed at Rio like she was accusing her of a crime. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio struggled to swallow. She could hear her pulse and feel the heaviness in the air. She stood up with purpose and walked straight at Agatha like a bee seeking a flower. Agatha’s back hit the door as she was trapped by Rio’s presence. Rio put both hands on either side of Agatha’s head, splayed against the wooden door. She could feel Agatha’s chest pumping in and out as the front of her dress made contact with her own. They were centimeters apart. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“If you tell me to stop…” Rio whispered before moving one hand down and flicking the lock on the door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t speak. She couldn’t. Every hesitation disintegrated in the face of Rio’s devout longing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She did the only thing that made sense. She dived forward, threw her arms around her long lost lover, and kissed her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>In a flash, it was summer again, and they were young and reckless. They were kissing in run-down hotel rooms in the middle of nowhere Illinois. They were kissing in locker rooms in repurposed community college baseball fields. They were kissing like it was their first time on a rooftop under the night sky.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was lost in Agatha’s lips as they kissed against the door. She could feel Agatha’s hands pulling at her uncomfortable dress and running along the fabric. Their tongues greeted each other in tentative swipes before mirroring the bodies around them and falling head first into each other. It was frenzied and desperate as they re-introduced themselves. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tried to force Rio back, but Rio was stronger than she looked and held the older woman hard against the door. Agatha let out an ungodly moan at the feeling of being held in place. She dipped her head and attacked Rio’s neck with aggression. There was fury there mixed with indisputable lust. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was floating as she held Agatha against her. It was too much to hope this was real. This fantasy had sustained her through so many lonely nights, and now it was really happening. She felt out of body, like she was watching it happen from above.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please, Rio.” Agatha moaned at her lips. She opened her eyes, and Rio was again struck by the foggy blues that cut through to her heart. There was need, desire, and ache pulling at her from those familiar eyes. Rio knew where she was wanted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She pulled Agatha off the door and guided her to one of the chairs. She kissed Agatha’s ring-studded hand and then dropped to her knees on the rug. Rio parted the legs in front of her and ran her hands up the nylon-covered calves, up to the elastic topped thighs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t tease me.” Agatha hiked her dress up, desperate to be touched. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t need to be told twice. She flipped the imposing fabric up and yanked Agatha’s underwear hard down and off, the other woman was wriggling on the chair, moving her hips uncontrollably as she waited for sweet release. Rio was tired of waiting. Her mouth found her target and immediately went to work. She knew they didn’t have much time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck - oh my…fuck.” Agatha’s hands twisted in Rio’s brunette locks as she pulled her closer and squeezed her thighs as the hot pressure started to build inside her. Rio pressed her hands down on the bucking hips and followed the sounds of Agatha’s pleasure to get her where she wanted to go. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Outside the party guests continued to arrive and walk down the long hallway. One woman paused for a second as she was walking, “Honey, what was that?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What, darling?” Her husband stopped alongside her and strained to listen. “I don’t hear anything. Though you know, they do say this building is haunted by the ghosts of those lost as sea. They can sometimes be heard moaning in the walls.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No!” The wife swatted at him. He knew she hated ghosts. They moved along right as a cry of intense passion rang out from the locked door of the staff office. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s body felt like a jellyfish, like all her bones had melted, as she slumped in the chair and basked in the post-orgasm bliss for a moment. Rio wiped her mouth on the back of her hand and eased up, cursing her aching knees. “Fuck, I don’t know how you squatted behind home plate for all those years.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>A laugh escaped Agatha’s lips at the unexpected reference, “Some of us are built differently.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She sat up and offered a hand to help Rio, but instead pulled her down into her lap. Rio was now straddling Agatha in the chair. Her arousal felt all-consuming. It had been so long. Agatha looked up at her with pure adoration. Rio ran a finger along the beautiful display of her jawline and caressed the familiar dimple in her chin. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nothing has ever compared to you.” Rio mused. She was too enamoured in this state to shy away from earnestness. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Kiss me.” Agatha urged and stretched up to meet Rio’s lips. She brought her hands to the waist on top of her and felt Rio rolling her hips. The kisses became more frantic as Rio growled against her, seeking her own resolution. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a knock, “Agatha? Rio? Are you still in there?” William’s voice called. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Give us five minutes!!” Agatha screamed in frustration. She didn’t want this to end so suddenly. She needed to see Rio break apart in her arms.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You think you can get me there that quickly?” Rio smirked above her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Time me.” Agatha challenged and urged Rio to spin around so that Rio’s back was now against her front in the chair. Her legs now spread wide on top of Agatha’s. Rio pulled up her taffeta skirt, brought the long hem to her mouth, and bit down to stifle any sound. She knew she wasn’t going to be quiet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha slipped a hand down the waistband of Rio’s underwear and was immediately met with drenched folds. “God, you’re so wet for me.” She whispered huskily into Rio’s ear which was leaning right against her. Her fingers moved in practiced circles as Rio’s body seemed to pulse and rock above her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She slipped inside easily and pumped her fingers in and out, relishing in Rio’s muffled whimpers. Her other hand came around to continue the attention on Rio’s aching clit, and Agatha felt a power rush through her. Rio was putty in her hands. The younger woman was bouncing on her fingers, palming at her own breasts in desperation, crying out for more. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio, pathetically, felt like she was about to break. It couldn’t have been more than a few minutes, and she was riding the edge of ecstasy already. Agatha’s hands were magic, and she was a goner. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she heard the words, “Come for me”, her entire body convulsed and snapped as her orgasm crashed over her like a tsunami. Her dress absorbed the scream that pulled itself from her throat as everything sharpened then burst apart behind her closed eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Three minutes, five seconds.” Agatha said with annoying smugness. She was eyeing the clock on the desk. Rio regained control and moved off Agatha’s body. She watched the woman take her right hand and delicately suck each finger, cleaning each one in her mouth. Rio didn’t think she would ever see a hotter sight. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Most people find arrogance off-putting.” Rio noted. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not most people.” Agatha countered as she leaned down and grabbed her own discarded underwear. She quickly slipped them back on, even knowing she was going to be uncomfortably wet for the remainder of this party. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You look ridiculous in that outfit, by the way.” Agatha remarked as Rio readjusted the borrowed dress, standing awkwardly in front of the mirror in the room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I had to blend in with the gang of merry homemakers.” Rio joked, trying to finagle her hair into a presentable style and not one that immediately said, ‘I just had the hottest sex of the past decade.’</span>
</p><p>
<span>They had less than two minutes before the boy was due back. “Please tell me that wasn’t a one time thing.” Rio didn’t want to imagine her life without Agatha again. In the post-sex haze, she didn’t want Agatha to regret this. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you busy on Thursday evening?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t stay out too late. I have an 8am lecture on Fridays.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You poor thing. No, it won’t be late. I coach the high school softball team. We have a game on Thursday. I’d like you to come…if you want.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was an olive branch. </span>
</p><p>
<span>An invitation into Agatha’s everyday life. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll be there.” Rio smiled just as a knock came on the door again. </span>
</p><hr/><p>
<span>“Where the hell have you been?” Peggy asked as Agatha tried to nonchalantly rejoin the gathering. Steve and the kids were outside looking at the water. Peggy was drinking alone by the window. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wanda’s kid is here.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?!” Peggy looked around wildly to try to spot him. Agatha pointed to the only young man in the joint, currently sitting on a bar stool next to Rio, as they chatted with the bartender. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s also gay.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“WHAT???” Peggy was stunned. “Oh, his mother must be pleased as punch.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He hasn’t told her yet.” Agatha said. Her eyes were trained on Rio. She didn’t like how close that busty bartender was leaning towards the woman who just made her see the eyes of god with her mouth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Godspeed to the boy. Wait, is that Rio next to him? What is this - some kind of impromptu reunion?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He was curious about why I left his life so suddenly. So I told him. Can’t fault the kid for wondering about his past.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why does Rio look like she just…” Peggy turned and examined Agatha. Mussed hair, wrinkled stockings, smudged lipstick. “Oh my fucking god.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not what you think!” Agatha started. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh no? So you’re saying you and Rio </span>
<em>
<span>didn’t</span>
</em>
<span> just shag like rabbits somewhere in this building?” Peggy asked with her hands on her hips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrank and covered her eyes, feeling her cheeks start to warm. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Peggy was loving this, “At least tell me - was it as good as you remember?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood up straighter, feeling bold as the last few moments flashed through her mind, “Better.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I knew it! Are you going to see her again?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hope so.” Agatha grinned. She didn’t know where this was going or what Rio wanted. All she knew was that for the first time in a long time, she felt hopeful. She had ignored her feelings for far too long. </span>
</p><p>
<span>For once, she deserved to be happy. </span>

<blockquote><p><span>“I don’t think anybody in the league had any thought of women in the future while we were playing . . . but . . . a good portion of the women have been in sports all of these years in one capacity or another, as teachers, instructors, or coaches. They all have added to supporting girls and women in sports throughout their lifetimes.”</span></p><p><span>Jeneane DesCombes</span></p></blockquote><p><span>It was the fifth game of the year for the Excel High Knights. Agatha had taken over the coaching gig in her third year teaching when the old gym teacher retired and nobody else wanted the job. She didn’t expect much, but coaching these girls was now her favorite part of the year. </span></p><p><span>She loved taking nervous freshmen and molding and shaping them until they became killer ballplayers. The girls both loved and feared her in equal measure. Coach Harkness was notorious in the state for her intensity and her results. Excel won the Massachusetts state championship for the past four years in a row, and they’d won two other times with Agatha at the helm. They lost once in ‘58 due to a food poisoning outbreak that struck half the team on the last game of the playoffs. Don’t bring it up to Agatha if you want to live. </span></p><p><span>“Hustle Susie! Come on, get your mitt!” Agatha yelled at the second baseman who was running from the parking lot. She was perpetually late and arrived as the team was already warming up in the field prior to the game. </span></p><p><span>“Alright, toss the ball around to get your arms warm. We’re up against Brighton today. They’re about as dangerous as a field mouse, so I expect big things in terms of score. If I don’t see at least five runs on that board, you better hope and pray that Friday practice gets cancelled.” Agatha addressed her team. She wasn’t above using threats. </span></p><p><span>The coach checked her clipboard with the roster and batting order. She was so busy re-ordering the starting lineup that she didn’t notice someone gliding right in beside her. </span></p><p><span>“Do you think you could use that ‘coach’ voice in the bedroom?” </span></p><p><span>Agatha gasped and saw Rio smiling next to her, looking confident in a pair of long shorts, blouse, and cardigan. </span></p><p><span>“You came.” She opened her arms and hugged her tightly. </span></p><p><span>“Of course. I’ll always come when you ask.” Rio stepped back and looked out at the practicing players. “They’re good. I can tell you’ve taught them well.”</span></p><p><span>“I don’t think they could stand a chance against the Comets back in the day, but they’re not bad for a group of wily teens.” </span></p><p><span>“At least they don’t have to play in skirts.” Rio joked. </span></p><p><span>“I fought hard to make that true. You should have seen the stink I kicked up at the school board meeting when they tried to implement dress uniforms.” Agatha wasn’t going to make young girls have to slide on skin like she had to. </span></p><p><span>“I can only imagine.”</span></p><p><span>“Do you want to meet them? Can you still pitch?” Agatha eyed her arm. </span></p><p><span>“It’s been a while…a long while. I don’t think I have that fast heater anymore, but I could probably still hurl a good curve. Do you have a mitt I could borrow?” </span></p><p><span>“Jane, come here! Give me your glove.” Agatha caught it as the girl tossed it over. Then whistled the rest of the team over. “Alright, get your bats. We’ve got a very special guest today. This is Rio Vidal. We used to play professional ball together back in the day. She had the finest arm in the league and threw a perfect game once. She’s agreed to throw batting practice for you, and you’ll thank her for it. She only throws overhand, but it’ll be good practice for you to work on your bat speed, timing, and identifying different pitches. Get ready!” </span></p><p><span>Rio put on the mitt. Design had come a long way from the big, beefy gloves they used to wield a decade ago. The new mitts were much lighter and streamlined. She flexed it open and closed. Agatha passed her a softball. It was way bigger than the ball she was accustomed to, but she could still get a decent grip on it. </span></p><p><span>“Will you catch for me? Like old times?” Rio asked, giving her best puppy dog eyes to the coach. </span></p><p><span>Agatha pursed her lips and considered it, “My knees are not what they used to be.”</span></p><p><span>Rio leaned in, whispered and patted her shoulder, “It’ll be good practice.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha pulled at her collar as she felt sudden heat crawling up her neck at the flashback to what happened in that yacht club office a few days ago, “I’m going to send you my doctor’s bill!”</span></p><p><span>“Go get your mask and gear on.” Rio ordered and walked to the pitcher’s mound. She hadn’t been on a field since she retired from the league. The red dirt welcomed her like an old friend. The teenage players gathered in their dugout and lined the fence to watch. Agatha eventually jogged out in the catcher’s gear, which didn’t quite fit right but would protect her well enough. </span></p><p><span>Before dropping behind the plate, she called out to her starting pitcher, “Donna, watch closely. Rio’s got a unique wind up.”</span></p><p><span>Rio took a big breath in and put her hands together in the mitt, lifted them above her head, kicked her leg out (ignoring the tight stretch in her hamstring), leaned back, and threw a down the middle fastball. She took a ton of speed off it to allow her arm time to readjust to pitching, but the placement was still as perfect as ever. </span></p><p><span>The chattering girls were stunned and silenced as the ball smacked Agatha’s mitt. Rio felt that exhilarating energy that only comes from pitching in front of a crowd, even the opposing team stopped their practice to turn and watch. She threw a few more pitches, before Agatha called over the first batter. </span></p><p><span>“Remember Joyce. Eye on the ball. Rio’s not going to hold back, so if you’re going to swing, commit early.” Agatha advised the batter. She looked small and nervous from Rio’s point of view. She’d normally eat batters like this for breakfast but knew that wasn’t the point of this exercise. </span></p><p><span>Agatha dropped a two - sign for a curve ball. Rio adjusted her grip and threw a sweeping curve that came in high and then dropped. Joyce swung and missed. She was close though. Agatha called for the same pitch. Rio took some power off it and threw the curve. The bat connected and sent the ball bouncing towards third base. The team cheered for their friend, who was grinning with all her teeth. </span></p><p><span>Agatha pushed her mask up and walked out to Rio, “Don’t steal her struggle.”</span></p><p><span>“What?” Rio grabbed another ball from the bucket beside her. </span></p><p><span>“I know you let her have that one. Don’t go easy on them. They’ll never get better if you hold back.”</span></p><p><span>“Look at her. She’s so happy.” Rio pointed to the girl who was still smiling as she sat on the bench. </span></p><p><span>“Imagine how much happier she’d be if she’d really hit one off you.” </span></p><p><span>“I thought this was batting practice. You’re a real hard ass, you know?” </span></p><p><span>“I’m aware. Now pitch like I know you can.” Agatha said before heading back to home plate. Rio felt like they were back in time. It was all so surreal being back on a diamond with Agatha. </span></p><p><span>The next girl put on her helmet and came out. She was taller and had the aggression that makes for a talented athlete. Rio’s eyes connected with Agatha’s blues. That unspoken understanding was still fresh between them. Agatha dropped a single finger for a fastball. </span></p><p><span>Rio felt like her arm was warm. She wound up and fired. </span></p><p><span>The batter didn’t even swing. Rio saw her eyes widen and by the time her brain told her body to move, the ball was already safe in Agatha’s mitt. </span></p><p><span>“How am I meant to hit that?” Vicky asked, still in shock. </span></p><p><span>Agatha threw the ball back to Rio, “Swing earlier.” </span></p><p><span>Rio threw two more fastballs and Vicky still couldn’t get a piece. Agatha called for a changeup instead so as not to wear out the pitcher too quickly. Vicky waited on it and sent it flying to the outfield. </span></p><p><span>The rest of the game lineup took their turns. Only two hitters were able to get a piece of Rio’s fastball. Agatha was right though. Rio saw the immense sense of satisfaction in the batters and the way their team celebrated their well-earned success. </span></p><p><span>“Great batting practice, team. Say thank you to Rio.” Agatha said. </span></p><p><span>“Thank you, Rio!” They all chanted at her. Rio smiled shyly. She wasn’t used to working with young people and being on the receiving end of their gratitude. </span></p><p><span>“Game starts in ten minutes, so run to the bathroom or the water fountain if you need to. We’re not wasting a timeout again!” Rio watched as Agatha shot daggers at a brunette standing near the back, who was suddenly looking very interested in the clouds. “Go stretch!” The girls dispersed leaving Agatha and Rio standing outside the dugout. </span></p><p><span>“They should have frozen your arm in time. It belongs in a hall of fame, not on some research scientist sitting in a lab.” Agatha said. </span></p><p><span>“Hall of Fame? As if, they’ll ever let a couple of dames in one of those! I’m glad you value throwing a fastball over life-saving vaccines.” Rio snarked back. </span></p><p><span>“Both are important. Baseball saved my life more than once.” </span></p><p><span>“It saved mine too.” Rio agreed. She couldn’t imagine where she would be if she hadn’t earned the money for college during those two years playing ball. She would probably be stuck at the docks or married to some chump from her hometown. </span></p><p><span>“Are you going to stick around? I could use a first base coach. Normally, one of the girls stands in.” Agatha asked, trying not to get her hopes up. </span></p><p><span>“Sure, it could be fun.”</span></p><p><span>Rio helped the base runners with her directions and encouragement. She gave tips to the batters when she was in the dugout. She advised the pitchers on technique and strategy. It felt good to be back in the sport, like she had never left. </span></p><p><span>Most of all, it felt good to be around Agatha again. The coach was a machine on the field. She inspired something in the players like nothing Rio had ever seen. She was tough when she needed to be, yet she had this unshakeable softness with all of them. It was obvious she cared so deeply for each and every player. </span></p><p><span>Her competitive drive was like a tornado - it pulled in all those around her. Rio couldn’t stop watching her throughout the entire game. She was more attracted to Agatha in her track pants, t-shirt, and ballcap than she was in her finest dress. She couldn’t stop her heart pounding when she watched Agatha lay into the cowering ump who made a questionable call, or scream for joy at a no-doubt homer. </span></p><p><span>She was perfect. </span></p><p><span>The game was a blowout. Agatha’s team was miles better than their competitor, and the game ended in the fifth inning due to the mercy rule. The Knights were winning by 12 runs, so the umpires called it there. No need to embarrass the other team further. </span></p><p><span>“Do you want to get a drink?” Agatha slung her equipment bag over her shoulder. “The game finished so much earlier than I thought.” It was only 7. </span></p><p><span>Rio nodded, “I’ll follow you.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha drove to </span><em><span>The Hidden Gate</span></em><span>, a local upscale bar near the college campus. They grabbed a booth and Rio ordered two beers. She carried the glasses over to the table and set them down carefully. </span></p><p><span>“Thanks again. The girls were so impressed with you. The pitchers wouldn’t shut up about it. You really made an impression.” Agatha held up her beer and Rio clinked her glass before taking a drink. </span></p><p><span>“Thanks for inviting me. I liked seeing this side of you. You’re the same.”</span></p><p><span>“I’d like to think I’m a little different, a little better.”</span></p><p><span>Rio smiled to herself, “You are different, but you still have that diseased need to win at all costs.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha shrugged, “These girls don’t have a lot of opportunities to compete in their lives. There is only one softball team and one volleyball team at my school. There aren’t enough girls for any other sports. So I try to make sure they succeed.”</span></p><p><span>“More proof that Agatha Harkness has feelings.” </span></p><p><span>“Hey, don’t go spreading that around. I’ve got a reputation around here.” Agatha playfully glanced around her shoulders. </span></p><p><span>They each took a drink of their beers and simply stared at each other. Both were unsure where they wanted this conversation to go. Their relationship was in such a peaceful state, yet to Rio it felt more like balancing on the edge of a cliff. </span></p><p><span>She decided to take a leap of faith. She didn’t want to keep laying awake for another night wondering, “Do you want to be with me?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha’s eyebrows shot up at the boldness of the question. There was no misinterpreting this. “Rio…”</span></p><p><span>“Don’t tell me you can’t feel…whatever this is between us. That you didn’t enjoy yourself the other day. I need to know.” Rio pleaded. </span></p><p><span>“Nothing’s changed. In the world, I mean. It’s just as taboo to be a lesbian today as it ever was. Most people still view it as a mental disorder! They still arrest people in some states.”</span></p><p><span>“We will always be persecuted and demonized, but I’d rather hide in the shadows with you than be in the sunlight alone.” Rio didn’t want to watch Agatha slip through her fingers again. Being with her on the field again had just solidified all her wants. She knew she couldn’t live another way.  </span></p><p><span>“I could lose my job. I could be run out of the neighborhood. I could be sent away for all I know. And then what? Would you still want to be with me in the loony bin?”</span></p><p><span>“I want to be with you in any way and any reality that you’d take me. I am going to want you until the day I die. I swear, Agatha. I only want you.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha opened and closed her mouth. She was so blown away by the declaration. </span></p><p><span>“Just let me fucking love you.” Rio added with a smirk. </span></p><p><span>That got a laugh out of Agatha, “You drive me mad. You make me want to rip my hair out and rip my clothes off. It’s deranged! When I look at you, I want to fight you and then fuck you. What have you done to me? What spell have you trapped me in?”</span></p><p><span>“I think they call it love, sweetheart.”</span></p><p><span>“It’s been too long. You still have time.”</span></p><p><span>“Time for what?” Rio asked. </span></p><p><span>“Time to find someone better!”</span></p><p><span>“I’ve already found you.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha started to speak, but Rio put a hand up. “Just…don’t respond. I know I’ve sprung this on you. I know it’s not fair. I don’t want you to say something just because you think I want to hear it. Take some time. Think about this, then come find me. Okay?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha agreed, and they finished their drinks and parted ways for the night. </span></p><p><span>As she drove home to Back Bay, her every thought echoed with shades of Rio. She couldn’t escape her grasp, and the more she thought about it, the more she realized…she didn’t want to. </span></p><hr/><p><span>Rio spent the weekend in her room, at her desk, endlessly reading the latest medical journals. It was the only thing that kept her mind busy enough to keep out other thoughts. </span></p><p><span>A knock at her door, “Rio? Are you alive in there?” Alice peeked her head in. She hadn’t seen her roommate come out in two days. </span></p><p><span>Rio looked up. Her eyes were bloodshot, her hand was cramped from taking notes, her hair a complete mess. “I’m something.”</span></p><p><span>“God, let some light in here at least.” She crossed the space and yanked open the blinds. She threw the comforter over the bed and sat down. “What’s going on? You’re a hermit, but not normally like this.”</span></p><p><span>Rio stood up and stretched. Her back felt tight from sitting for so long. She hadn’t heard from Agatha. She was kicking herself for getting her hopes up yet again. What’s that saying about the definition of insanity - she couldn’t be bothered to remember.  </span></p><p><span>“I’m fine. I need to finish this reading before Monday.” </span></p><p><span>“So the fact that you’re avoiding all human interaction after recently meeting your old flame is just a coincidence?” Alice guessed. </span></p><p><span>Rio slumped back into her chair and sighed her heavy feelings out, “I thought this was meant to get easier as we get older.”</span></p><p><span>“Why would you think that? The older we get, the harder it is to deal with other people’s bullshit. When you find someone you want to spend your time with, it’s hard to let that go.”</span></p><p><span>“I just thought I’d handle this better. Yet here I am - the same pitiful gal, waiting by the phone for someone who won’t call.” Rio said. </span></p><p><span>“I’m sure she will.”</span></p><p><span>Rio’s breath hitched at the pointed pronoun. “Wait, you knew?”</span></p><p><span>Alice laughed, “Come on, mack. You have a framed photo of Judy Garland on your wall. Your entire record collection is full of beautiful women. You’ve never so much as made a pass at any guy or talked about liking any of my objectively good-looking single male friends. It doesn’t take a genius like you to deduce it. Seeing that you were a pro ballplayer was just the cherry on top.”</span></p><p><span>“Hey, not all ballplayers are queer.”</span></p><p><span>“Sure, sure. And not all women who dye their hair with bright colors are lesbians…but some are.” Alice twirled her hair that she’d recently added bright red streaks. </span></p><p><span>“You?” Rio pointed at her roommate. She’d known the girl for two years now and never guessed. </span></p><p><span>“I dabble. Men, women. It’s so limiting to deny all of life’s pleasures.” </span></p><p><span>“Aren’t you full of surprises? Do you have any sage wisdom on dealing with a repressed, older woman that is afraid to date you?” </span></p><p><span>Alice hummed and looked at the ceiling as she considered the complicated question, “You have to let her come to you. Otherwise, you’ll be chasing her for your entire life.”</span></p><p><span>As she was contemplating how to chase Agatha through eternity, Rio’s phone rang. They both locked eyes in surprise. It couldn’t be…</span></p><p><span>“Hello?” Rio picked up the receiver. Alice was staring in rapt attention. </span></p><p><span>“It’s me.” </span></p><p><span>Rio gave a huge thumbs up to Alice, who was now jumping on the bed in excitement. “What are you up to?” Rio asked. </span></p><p><span>“I’ve been thinking about you.” Agatha admitted. </span></p><p><span>“Yeah, me too.” Rio waved Alice to get out of her room, much to her chagrin. </span></p><p><span>“Sorry for the wait. I wanted to see if you were busy next weekend. I’m hosting a little get together for Peggy’s birthday. Nothing fancy, no need to bring a gift, just an appetizer to share. I’m making roast chicken.”</span></p><p><span>“On Saturday or Sunday?”</span></p><p><span>“Saturday for dinner.” Agatha responded. </span></p><p><span>“Sure, will it be all your hoity-toity neighbors or will there be some normal people there too?”</span></p><p><span>“Excuse you, there will be a lot of teachers, artists, all sorts. You won’t be the only poor.”</span></p><p><span>“Wow, thanks. You’re a real charmer.” Rio laughed at Agatha’s blunt humor. </span></p><p><span>“It’s what drew you to me isn’t it?”</span></p><p><span>“I thought it was the way your legs looked in that catcher’s position but…”</span></p><p><span>“Rio! You dirty dog.” Agatha cackled at the boldness that sometimes caught her off guard. “So I take it you’re in? You’ll be there?”</span></p><p><span>“Yes, ma’am. What should I wear?”</span></p><p><span>“Whatever you feel good in. We’ll be eating, dancing, and drinking.”</span></p><p><span>“Okay, sounds good. I’ll see you then.” Rio smiled. </span></p><p><span>“Great, see you.” Agatha hung up. </span></p><p><span>Alice immediately burst through the door. She had clearly been listening, “Did she ask you over to her house?”</span></p><p><span>Rio nodded, “Next weekend!”</span></p><p><span>“Score! Maybe your luck is changing.”</span></p><p><span>“Maybe.” </span></p>

<blockquote><p><span>“I was just getting into my prime. . . . I thought it would last forever. . . . I prayed every day that it would last forever.”</span></p><p><span>Catherine Horstman</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Rio prepared guava pastelitos on Saturday afternoon. Her aunt used to make them every Sunday before church. They were light, flaky, fruity, and so delicious. Alice was her willing taste-tester and gave her two thumbs up. </span></p><p><span>“These are incredible. Why don’t you cook more?” She asked. Rio was more of a grazer in the kitchen and rarely cooked full meals. She never baked anything. </span></p><p><span>“I should. My aunt was an amazing chef. I really miss her cooking - every time I try to recreate her dishes, it pales in comparison.” </span></p><p><span>“How are you aunt and uncle doing?” Alice had only met them once, last Christmas when they came up to visit. </span></p><p><span>“Good, they don’t know what to do with themselves now that all my cousins are out of the house. I swear my aunt is ready to lose her mind. They’ve adopted two more chihuahuas on top of the one they already had. My uncle said they follow him everywhere. He’s already planning his next trip up here to escape.” </span></p><p><span>“Tell him to bring some more of that Puerto Rican rum if he comes before summer break. I’ve been craving it ever since they brought it last time.”</span></p><p><span>“Will do. Can I borrow your leather jacket again? I was going to wear it tonight.” Rio was planning to wear a pair of form-fitting plaid ankle pants with a sleeveless white shirt and thought the 50’s statement piece would go perfectly with it. </span></p><p><span>“It’s all yours. Have a good time!”</span></p><p><span>Rio took a cab this time to Agatha’s house since she planned to drink and didn’t want to risk driving. She arrived a little early to help her setup. </span></p><p><span>She rang the doorbell. </span></p><p><span>“Did I leave the oven on or is that just you, hot stuff?” Agatha quipped upon opening the door and taking in Rio’s look. </span></p><p><span>“Shut up. Here, I baked these.” Rio held up her platter of pastelitos that she’d carried here. </span></p><p><span>“I didn’t know you could bake.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m a woman of many talents.”</span></p><p><span>“I know that’s true.” Agatha led the way to the kitchen, which was at the back of the house. The room was covered in a mix of freestanding and mounted cabinets and shelving. There were pots and pans hanging on the walls and a glorious hutch over the oven. It was clear this room had seen many renovations over its long history and was marked by each decade in different ways. </span></p><p><span>“Smells amazing in here.” Rio remarked and took in the bubbling pots on the stove. There was also a mound of prep dishes already piled in the sink. Rio shrugged out of her jacket and went to hang it on the coat rack by the door. She then got to work washing the dishes. </span></p><p><span>“You don’t need to do that. I’ll take care of it after.” Agatha said. </span></p><p><span>“Don’t be too proud. It’s better to get it out of the way now.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha smiled and went back to work seasoning the chopped vegetables in the roasting dish. “I didn’t expect you this early.” </span></p><p><span>“Is it alright?” Rio asked. She hadn’t checked in to see if it was okay. </span></p><p><span>“I like it.”</span></p><p><span>“Good.” Rio kept washing the assorted bowls and tools. </span></p><p><span>After Agatha pulled off the boiling potatoes and put the remaining veggies in the oven, she untied her apron. “Do you want to see the rest of the house?”</span></p><p><span>Rio finished drying the peeler in her hand, “Yes please.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha led them through the other door in the kitchen, which flowed into the formal dining room. The table was extended to fit twelve chairs and had been beautifully styled with placemats, matching napkins, and fine china. </span></p><p><span>“I thought you said this wasn’t fancy.” Rio remarked as she scanned the perfectly set table. </span></p><p><span>“This is my casual dinnerware. The fancy stuff is reserved for Thanksgiving or Christmas. If you’re lucky, I’ll think about inviting you.” Agatha kept walking through the arched doorway to the living room. There were a few elegant couches around a television. A record player sat near the window, and a persian rug took up most of the flooring. </span></p><p><span>“Did you buy most of this furniture?” Rio asked. </span></p><p><span>“Some of it. Some pieces belonged to my husband or his family. Why? Not a fan?” Agatha explained. </span></p><p><span>“It just seems so stuffy.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha laughed, “That’s the style for this neighborhood. Maybe you’ll like the second floor more.” She led them up the stairs. The stairwell was decorated in frames with art and photos. Rio took her time looking at each one. </span></p><p><span>Agatha as a teenager in a school photo. Agatha holding Nicky when he couldn’t be more than two years old. Agatha and Peggy in their first year with the Comets. Agatha on her wedding day. She looked like a vision in the long white dress. Agatha and her husband in Times Square. Agatha and Peggy’s two kids when they were young. Agatha with each of her winning school softball teams. It was her life in snapshots. Rio wished she was somewhere on this wall. </span></p><p><span>“Keep up!” Agatha shouted from the top of the stairs. </span></p><p><span>Rio hustled up the last few and was in another long hallway. The first room on the left looked like an office or a reading room. Large bookshelves covered almost every wall. There was a very comfy, large recliner in one corner next to a floor lamp. Right across from that room was the main bathroom, which had a stunning clawfoot tub. </span></p><p><span>“Apparently that tub has been in this house since it was built in 1889. Can you believe that?” Agatha asked. </span></p><p><span>“Think of all the bare butts that have sat on that porcelain.”</span></p><p><span>“Rio! I love that tub - don’t ruin it for me!” </span></p><p><span>Rio shrugged, “Just an observation.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha kept walking and opened the next door further down the hall. It was a guest bedroom, but there looked to be a large cage in the corner. </span></p><p><span>“What’s that?” Rio asked, trying to see what could be in there. </span></p><p><span>Agatha kneeled down and unlocked the cage door, reached in, and pulled out to Rio’s complete surprise a fluffy white and tan rabbit. “This is Señor Scratchy.”</span></p><p><span>“What…” Rio watched as Agatha affectionately snuggled the floppy bunny. </span></p><p><span>“One of the class pets at school was pregnant and gave birth to a bunch of baby rabbits. They couldn’t find a home for this little guy, so on a whim, I adopted him. I don’t know why. It was not too long after Jimmy died. I think I just couldn’t bear another night by myself in this house.” Agatha brought the rabbit over and Rio gave him a small pet. He was extremely soft. </span></p><p><span>“I’m glad someone could be here for you…even if it was just this guy.”</span></p><p><span>“Back to rest, Mister. I’ll bring you your dinner soon.” Agatha muttered as she put him back in his large enclosure. </span></p><p><span>They saw one more guest room, and then there was just one last room. Agatha opened the door to her bedroom and let Rio in first. While the downstairs was relatively bland and elegant, this room was entirely Agatha. </span></p><p><span>The four poster bed was all drama. The dark violet curtains immediately drew the eye and dominated the space beneath a completely over-the-top chandelier. There was a large walk-in closet full of every color of dress and gown. Another door must lead to an en-suite.</span></p><p><span>An ornate dressing table sat in the corner with a collection of perfumes and make-up. Jewelry was displayed tastefully in open, velvet-lined boxes. A handful of brooches lined the top of the table beneath the mirror for easy access. Rio could so easily imagine all the mornings Agatha spent getting ready right here. </span></p><p><span>There was dark wood wainscotting along the walls, which matched the hallway, with cream paint on top. There were mementos and interesting art pieces everywhere - from Red Sox flags to antique paintings to postcards from Midwest towns. </span></p><p><span>“Wow, it’s so…subtle.” Rio deadpanned as she twirled around to take it all in. </span></p><p><span>“It’s been nice to have a space that’s completely my own.” Agatha had never been allowed to decorate her room under her mother’s strict eye, she’d felt obliged to both her husbands, and she’d lived in rentals while playing ball. </span></p><p><span>“I’m just joking. It’s great. I really love it.” Rio approached Agatha from behind. The older woman was readjusting a slightly off-center frame. Rio slowly ran her hands through Agatha’s hair and received an unexpected moan in return. It sent a wave of goosebump up Rio’s arms. </span></p><p><span>The loud doorbell rang throughout the house, cutting right through them. Agatha shook out her body to snap out of…whatever that was, and hurriedly made her way back downstairs. Rio tried hard to tamp down the arousal rising in her body. She couldn’t be feeling like this around Agatha’s friends. </span></p><p><span>“Margaret, Kay, how are you both?” Agatha’s candy-sweet voice sounded so foreign. </span></p><p><span>Rio walked downstairs and saw two women around Agatha’s age taking off their expensive wool coats. They must be neighbors. </span></p><p><span>“Oh and this is an old friend, Rio.” Agatha introduced her as she stepped off the stairs. She could feel their prying eyes taking in her pants and youthful hairstyle, but they were polite as they greeted her. </span></p><p><span>“Nice to meet you both.” Rio put up a hand to wave. </span></p><p><span>The rest of the ladies arrived in succession. It really was a mixed bag. There was a teacher in her 60s named Irma that smoked out of an old-timey cigarette holder. Rio took a few hits out of curiosity and didn’t hate it. There were a few of Peggy’s friends, whose husbands were artists like Steve. One of them, Constance, was from Alabama and told Rio about the upcoming March on Washington that civil rights leaders were currently organizing. A young journalist recounted how she worked on the harrowing Boston Strangler story that had terrorized the city over the past year. </span></p><p><span>As Agatha served up the staggering spread of food, the entire table was buzzing with interesting conversation. Rio wanted to be everywhere. It seemed like every person here had something to say. </span></p><p><span>The hostess clinked her glass to get their attention, “Thank you all for coming to celebrate my oldest and dearest friend. Peggy, I can’t imagine my life without you in it. You have been there for me through it all. I’m so incredibly happy that we are still friends and that we are still in each other’s lives. I love you. I’m grateful for you. Happy Birthday!” </span></p><p><span>The entire table raised their glasses and echoed the sentiment to the tearful birthday girl, who stood up from her seat, “Oh I thought I told you not to make me cry!” She pointed to Agatha, who just grinned in return. “I don’t know what to say. I never imagined that when I was in my 50s, I’d be living in America, a wife, and a mother to two children. It’s been a rollercoaster, but I wouldn’t have it any other way. Thank you all for being here, for being my friends, and thank you Agatha for all of this!</span></p><p><span>Rio watched the two friends admire each other. Decades of friendship swinging between them like a metronome. It was a beautiful outpouring of support and made her appreciate her invitation to witness it all the more. </span></p><p><span>As the group retired to the living room for more drinks, Agatha brought out a beautifully decorated chocolate cake topped with lit candles.</span></p><p><span>“Who’d you pay to make that because I know it wasn’t you.” Peggy sniped at Agatha, who she knew couldn’t bake to save her life. </span></p><p><span>“Mrs. Hart sends her regards.” Agatha chuckled before leading the group in the birthday song. </span></p><p><span>After indulging in the rich dessert, everyone sprawled out onto the couches or floor. </span></p><p><span>“So, has anyone got any good scar stories? I know this group must have some interesting ones.” Peggy’s friend, Anita asked. </span></p><p><span>“Oooooooh, I love a gruesome injury story.” Irma rubbed her hands together. Rio almost spit out her water. </span></p><p><span>The birthday girl stood up first and lifted her dress. She rolled down her stocking, revealing the discolored patch on her upper thigh, “Not particularly gruesome, but sliding on dirt for a few years has permanently messed up my leg. I don’t think this skin is ever going to look normal again.”</span></p><p><span>“Yikes! I can’t believe they let you girls do that back in the day. It seems unnecessarily cruel.” Marcia, a teacher, shook her head. </span></p><p><span>“This country is nothing if not unnecessarily cruel to women.” Constance remarked. </span></p><p><span>“Amen. Check this out.” Pat, one of the neighbors, lifted her hair up to reveal her neck. There was a noticeable, raised line cutting across her hair line. “I was 14. A group of older boys were in their car driving along the road by my school. I was walking home and they were throwing rocks at all the girls. I got hit right in the back of the neck. I needed ten stitches. The boys were identified and never punished.”</span></p><p><span>“What?!” Several women shouted. </span></p><p><span>“Fucking typical.” Agatha added. It was not surprising but still disappointing. </span></p><p><span>“I’ve only got a boring scar from when I got my appendix out.” Margaret offered, trying to lighten the mood.</span></p><p><span>“Look at this.” Maria, another teacher, took off her long white gloves and showed off an intense scar running almost the length of her elbow to her wrist. </span></p><p><span>“Wow, I’ve never noticed that!” Peggy came in closer to inspect it. </span></p><p><span>“I try to keep my gloves on for a reason. I was in a car accident when I was in college. My fella was driving us to my parent’s house and a drunk driver t-boned us in an intersection. Luckily, the back of the car took most of the impact, but I still broke my arm in two places and needed surgery.”</span></p><p><span>“That’s so scary. Was your boyfriend okay?”</span></p><p><span>“Yeah, just a few bruises, but his car was totaled. He never got over it, and we broke up a few months later. I couldn’t deal with all the complaining!” She laughed. </span></p><p><span>Agatha stood up next. Rio held her breath. She knew that Agatha had a scar on her knee from her surgery. Instead, she rolled up the sleeve of her dress. “Number 2 pencil to the elbow.”</span></p><p><span>“Ooof. That’s a classic.” One of the teachers cringed. </span></p><p><span>Agatha continued, “My second year teaching. It was a rowdy bunch, and I was still finding my footing. There was a fight on the quad during a passing period. I ran over to break it up, unaware that one of the feral kids was wielding a pencil like a shank. He stabbed me right in the elbow on accident. I didn’t even realize until someone screamed that I was bleeding. Luckily the nurse was able to pull it out and patch me up. I certainly learned a lesson that day - never try to do a good thing.” The teachers in the group cracked up. </span></p><p><span>“I thought you’d know better than to try and get involved in a fight. Remember the time Rio socked you in the nose?” Peggy laughed and laughed as Rio blushed deeply at the embarrassing memory. </span></p><p><span>“That was not on purpose!” She tried to argue. </span></p><p><span>“What about you, Rio? Surely you’ve got a few.” Peggy asked and the whole room turned their attention to her. Rio felt a frog in her throat as Agatha looked at her expectantly. </span></p><p><span>She had a few physical scars. Some from the dangerous welding job she had during the war, a few from playing ball, some old ones from a childhood spent outside. But there was one that was more painful than all the others combined. “A long time ago, I loved someone…”</span></p><p><span>“Awwww.” Someone cooed in the group. </span></p><p><span>Rio continued, “And I had to do something that I did not want to do, even though it was my job.”</span></p><p><span>Coach’s voice resonated in her memory, “</span><em><span>Rio, you tell me what I should do. You need a catcher who can actually catch.”</span></em><span> </span></p><p><span>“And it hurt them.” Rio felt Agatha’s stare like the harsh rays of the sun - it was burning her. The room was enthralled with the drama. “She is my scar.”</span></p><p><span>Eyes bulged at the implication, glances were thrown between friends and strangers, Peggy reached out as Agatha shot up, “I need to stretch my legs.” She rushed out the back door. Rio immediately followed her and ignored the whispers that broke out as soon as she left the room. </span></p><p><span>The back garden was more spacious than she expected. It extended far back and was like a little garden oasis. There were blooming azaleas, roses, and fruit trees. Rio jogged to the back gate and found Agatha standing, facing the rundown shed, staring at nothing. </span></p><p><span>“I’m sorry.” Rio began. Agatha startled, unaware that she wasn’t alone.</span></p><p><span>She turned with sadness in her eyes, “No, you didn’t do anything wrong.”</span></p><p><span>“I said I was in love with a woman in front of all your friends…”</span></p><p><span>“I don’t care.” Agatha said. </span></p><p><span>“Then why did you run?”</span></p><p><span>“Your love is so intense. It paralyzes me sometimes.”</span></p><p><span>“Is that…bad?” Rio didn’t know how else to respond. She knew she was being reckless with Agatha, but she also couldn’t find the energy to care. </span></p><p><span>“I’m not used to it.” Agatha extended her hand and brushed off a fallen leaf from Rio’s shoulder, “But I want to be.”</span></p><p><span>“Don’t make a promise that you don’t intend to keep.” </span></p><p><span>“Rio…” Agatha whispered her name like it lived in her mouth. Like she had growled it in frustration after losing a game with her softball team. Like she had moaned it while her husband was lost in his own bliss. Like she had whispered it while lost in a beautiful dream. Because she had. </span></p><p><span>They stood in silence as the request stretched out in the space. The late spring bugs buzzed around them. </span></p><p><span>“I-” Agatha began. </span></p><p><span>“Hey, you two! Come back, people are leaving!” Peggy hollered from the back doorstep. </span></p><p><span>Rio resented the interruption but turned to go. She felt a soft hand take her own and looked down to see Agatha’s fingers interlocking with her own. It was just for the few second walk back inside, but it was the beginning of a promise. </span></p><p><span>The other women exchanged goodbyes and well wishes to the birthday girl and the host. Rio just waited and observed the friendly customs, throwing in an occasional ‘nice to meet you’ or ‘I hope to see you again.’ </span></p><p><span>Peggy was the last to go, “Thanks, babe.” She kissed Agatha on the cheek. “You’ve outdone yourself again.” </span></p><p><span>She looked to Rio with a sly smile, “Don’t keep her up too late tonight - she’s got school tomorrow.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha physically pushed her out with a groan and the house was quiet finally. </span></p><p><span>“I should go. I’ve got class in the morning too.” Rio went to move towards the door. </span></p><p><span>“Wait. Stay. Please.” Agatha requested.</span></p><p><span>Rio put her jacket on. She wanted to stay. Obviously. But, she needed Agatha to tell her what she wanted. She wasn’t going to allow herself to be used and discarded again. “We shouldn’t.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha followed Rio to the front door. She watched her walk down the steps and head down the street, searching for a cab. Rio turned the corner towards the main street and wished it wasn’t like this. Why couldn’t Agatha just let her in? Why did this have to be so hard? Maybe she just needed to take the hint and move on. She’d put all her cards on the table. There was nothing more to be said. Agatha knew how she felt. </span></p><p><span>She looked into the rich mansions that she walked past and admired the domestic snapshots of family life that she’d never get. Families sitting down to a late dinner around an antique table. Young children gathered around the tube with their parents. Older couples reading together on the couch. A dancing couple waltzing around their living room. </span></p><p><span>As she agonized over what ifs, Rio heard the slap of shoes on the sidewalk and puffing breath. She turned. The streetlights illuminated the runner as they passed underneath each lamppost, arms pumping, hair a wild kite behind them, a clear athlete. </span></p><p><span>“Wait!” Her voice called out as Rio realized who it was. </span></p><p><span>Agatha finally stopped in front of her. She put her hands on her knees and tried to catch her breath. She hadn’t sprinted like that in years. It was tough running in house slippers. </span></p><p><span>“What are you doing?” Rio asked as Agatha finally stood tall and regained her composure. </span></p><p><span>“Stay over.” </span></p><p><span>“Agatha…”</span></p><p><span>“Tonight. Tomorrow. The next day. I want you now and every day in the future. I want to go to sleep with you. I want to wake up with you. I want it all with you.”</span></p><p><span>Rio was crying. She had no way to stop the tears that raced down her cheeks at the long awaited declaration. Her voice faltered despite her best efforts to maintain her cool exterior, “Are you serious?” </span></p><p><span>Agatha grabbed her and did her best to mold their bodies into one. She knew they couldn’t kiss out here in the middle of the street. But the hug communicated every pent up emotion and feeling that Agatha had been keeping hidden for so long. Rio could feel Agatha’s pounding heart from the run. She felt her arms squeezing her. She could smell the unique scent against Agatha’s throat that evoked early morning practices and hot and heavy nights. She melted into the embrace. </span></p><p><span>When they separated, Agatha grabbed her hand and pulled her along, “Come on, we’re going home.”</span></p><hr/><p><span>Rio was on cloud nine, drifting in a dream-like state. She drifted down the street holding Agatha’s hand. She drifted up the stairs and into the bathroom, where Agatha filled the tub and slowly stripped her of every last scrap of clothing. She drifted in the water as her lover joined her and kissed away any scraps of doubt that clung to her subconscious. She drifted to bed where they laid on wrapped around each other, completely nude, just tracing the shape of their limbs, remembering the feeling of closeness and adoration.</span></p><p><span>Rio had built a ten foot wall around her heart. Agatha was a wrecking ball. </span></p><p><span>“What changed your mind?” Rio asked. She was laying her head on Agatha’s shoulder, running a finger along the other’s collarbone. </span></p><p><span>“My mind has been made up since you waltzed back into my life. I just needed to let myself accept it. Hearing you talk about your ‘scar’ just hit me in a new way. I don’t know. I can’t explain it.”</span></p><p><span>“Hey I’m not complaining.” Rio twirled Agatha’s hair and pretended to use it as a paintbrush against her own cheek. “Before we go further and I forget my own name, I wanted to ask you something.” Rio sat up against the headboard but kept Agatha’s hand in hers, refusing to let it go. </span></p><p><span>“Go for it, pet.” Agatha replied. Rio felt a shiver up her spine at the nickname. </span></p><p><span>“How come you never looked for me? You knew I was still in the league, you knew where I lived in Florida. I just thought that you’d find me one day.” Rio didn’t want to go into the sad details. </span></p><p><span>“I came to a game…once. Your second year.” Agatha pushed up to a sitting position. </span></p><p><span>“What? When?”</span></p><p><span>“It was early in that season. Against the Belles. I was in a dark place. My mom was gone, Peggy was on her honeymoon, I was all alone. I packed an overnight bag, drove to the train station, and got on the first train to Chicago. I missed the game. I missed you.”</span></p><p><span>“Why didn’t you talk to me? If I had known you were there...damn it! I used to look for you at every game. I would scan the stands and try to will you into existence. I would think ‘this is the game. This is the game when she’ll come back.’ And it never was. I gave up looking.” Rio said, feeling so dejected. </span></p><p><span>“I sat near the announcer’s booth. Just another face in the crowd. I couldn’t bear it - being there and not being on the field. You weren’t pitching, but I saw you in the dugout, chatting with Dottie and Fossey. It made me so mad. And that’s not fair, but I was just pissed that you got to keep playing and I didn’t. It looked like you moved on. I stayed for four innings, then just up and left. Back to my sad new reality. I tried to put it all away.”</span></p><p><span>Rio threw her arm over Agatha’s shoulders and pulled her closer, “I wish I would have known. I would have dropped everything. I only lasted that second season before I had to turn it in. I couldn’t keep playing without you - it wasn’t the same.”</span></p><p><span>“You probably wouldn’t be out here curing deadly diseases. Society should be thanking me for breaking your heart actually!” Agatha smugly declared, which earned her a swift bite on her neck. </span></p><p><span>Agatha put a hand under Rio’s chin and pulled her up for a kiss. Rio felt swept away again by the gesture, like she was sucked into a riptide. It could kill her, and she didn’t mind. She let herself be taken by Agatha’s current and surrendered her body completely. </span></p><p><span>They had sex like they were fighting. It wasn’t sweet and tender. It was an argument with no words. A quiet battle of unspoken rage and the apologies they were too proud to say aloud. </span></p><p><span>Rio was shouting when she bit down hard on Agatha’s nipple - </span><em><span>Fuck you for making me wait this long. Fuck you for marrying someone who wasn’t me. </span></em></p><p><span>Agatha was screaming as her fingers pumped inside Rio - </span><em><span>Fuck you for ruining me for anyone else in this world. Fuck you for making me fall in love with you. </span></em></p><p><span>A yank of the hair - </span><em><span>Fuck you for leaving me with nothing but your memory. </span></em></p><p><span>A scratch down the back - </span><em><span>Fuck you for all this wasted time. </span></em></p><p><span>They ripped and tore at each other until there were no fucks left, until there was only the raw truth of their obsession. </span></p><p><span>A swipe of the tongue on an angry welt - </span><em><span>I love the way you still care. </span></em></p><p><span>A gentle caress of the face - </span><em><span>I love how you challenge me. </span></em></p><p><span>A long stare into hooded eyes -</span><em><span> I love the way I feel when I’m around you. </span></em></p><p><span>A prolonged and desperate open-mouthed kiss - </span><em><span>I love that you’re back in my life. </span></em></p><p><span>When they came down from their highs and looked at each other in Agatha’s absurdly opulent bed, the words came as easy as an off-speed pitch, right down the middle. </span></p><p><span>“I love you.” </span></p><p><span>“I love you too.” </span></p>

<blockquote><p><span>“I just know that I loved the game, I always loved it all my life. And I wouldn’t take anything if I had a choice of switching from playing ball to something else. . . . I just loved the game. And the All-American League was beautiful.”</span></p><p><span>Jean Faut</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Rio loaded the last box of her books into her new Chevy Impala. Agatha had bought it for her last weekend as an ‘early Christmas present’ despite it both only being June and her protests that it was way too much. Apparently, she got a good deal on it from the vice principal at her school who was upgrading, and Rio needed a car to commute to campus from Agatha’s house. </span></p><p><span>“I’m going to miss you.” Alice admitted. While they weren’t the best of friends, the two had a very pleasant and fun relationship. Plus, she didn’t want to get stuck with some dweeb for a roommate. </span></p><p><span>“I’ll still be around. I’ve got a year left of my degree, remember? We can catch up whenever.” Rio said. </span></p><p><span>“You’ll be too busy with your beau.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m just a phone call away.” Rio shut the trunk and gave Alice a big hug. “Have a good summer. Don’t go too wild!”</span></p><p><span>“Good luck, Rio. I hope it all works out.” </span></p><p><span>Rio looked up at her old apartment one last time as she walked over to the driver’s seat. Just a few months ago, she’d been happy to spend the rest of her time in Cambridge right there. Now she was moving in with Agatha and starting a new life together. She wanted to pinch herself. </span></p><p><span>Agatha told her neighbors that she was renting out one of the numerous spare bedrooms to a promising student as a way to give back to the community. It was the perfect cover and eliminated any prying eyes or questions about Rio’s presence. Nobody needed to know that they shared the same bed each night and were hopelessly in love. </span></p><p><span>There was a long history of women living together without a man. It was called a “Boston Marriage” because of its prevalence in this area in fact, so there was precedence. Plus, Agatha’s status as a widow afforded her many privileges that unmarried women might not receive. </span></p><p><span>Despite their best efforts to keep people away, they received a knock on the door one day a few days after Rio settled in. </span></p><p><span>“William, what are you doing here?” Rio asked. They were in the middle of eating breakfast on a beautiful, warm Saturday morning. </span></p><p><span>“My mom is coming this afternoon.” </span></p><p><span>“Come in.” Rio stepped aside to let him into the house. He followed her to the dining room and took a seat beside Agatha, who was cutting into a stack of pancakes. </span></p><p><span>“Don’t you have any other older women to bother on the weekend?” Agatha asked sarcastically. </span></p><p><span>“But you two are my favorite.” He joked as Rio passed him a plate and a fork, then dished him some breakfast.</span></p><p><span>“Need help talking to mommy?” Agatha guessed. </span></p><p><span>He took a bite of the crispy bacon that Rio had fried up, “I don’t think I can do it alone. What if she disowns me? What if she makes a scene?”</span></p><p><span>“Why are you telling her anyway? It can’t bring any good.” Agatha advised. </span></p><p><span>“I can’t keep lying! She keeps asking me about girls, about if I’m dating anyone, about marriage! It’s killing me to keep making up stories. Tommy gets to bring his girlfriend over on holidays, and I’m left alone.” </span></p><p><span>“Where are you going to tell her?” Rio asked. </span></p><p><span>“I booked us a table at Parker’s for dinner. I’m going to show her around campus for a while, and then we’re heading straight there. I can call and add two more to the booking though…” He looked at them both expectantly. </span></p><p><span>“No way, kid. Sorry, that’s a conversation you need to have alone.” Agatha shook her head. Rio, the more empathetic of the two, gave her a look. “Ugh, I guess, we could possibly run into you both on campus when you’re giving her a tour.”</span></p><p><span>“Really?” William perked up like a child who just got told there was a snow day. “That would be so helpful. Maybe if she sees you two, she’ll realize that I’m not the only one.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, “She might not even want to speak to us.”</span></p><p><span>“It’s been a long time, Agatha.” Rio said. </span></p><p><span>“Yeah, grudges don’t typically ease with age. If anything, they grow over time.” </span></p><p><span>“She never brings up anything from the league. Maybe she’s forgotten the whole thing.” William speculated as he finished off his plate, soaking up the final drop of the syrup with the last bite of pancake. </span></p><p><span>“We could only be so lucky.” Agatha groaned. She was not looking forward to seeing Wanda again. </span></p><hr/><p><span>Around 5pm, Rio and Agatha drove over to Harvard Yard and parked in the visitor lot. It was actually nice for Rio to show off some of the places where she frequented in her time around the area. </span></p><p><span>She showed Agatha her favorite park where she liked to read, and the coffee shop where she used to flirt with the hot barista named Minne to get a cookie for free sometimes. This made Agatha seethe and refuse to go inside despite her previous requests for a sweet treat. They eventually made their way to the commons, the wide open gathering place, where William said he would meet them. </span></p><p><span>“Should I have brought some sort of protection?” Agatha asked, as they scanned the area for any sign of that distinctive scarlet hair. </span></p><p><span>“Protection? Like what a gun?” Rio looked at her like she was insane. </span></p><p><span>“You never know! What if Wanda takes a swing at me?”</span></p><p><span>“I’ll protect you, my love. I’ve got a nice right hook.” Rio held up her fists in jest. </span></p><p><span>“Oh god, there they are.” Agatha shaded her eyes as she spotted the mother and son approaching. </span></p><p><span>“Be cool.” </span></p><p><span>“I’m cooler than you.” Agatha snapped. She adjusted her modest plaid dress on the bench they were seated on together. </span></p><p><span>“You wish.” </span></p><p><span>William pointed to the two of them, and Rio watched Wanda’s eyes widen as she placed them in her mind. “Behave.” Rio muttered as she stood up and waved. </span></p><p><span>They could hear William’s play acting voice, “What a surprise! Look who it is, Mom!” </span></p><p><span>“Hey there, Little Red.” Agatha stood up and extended a hand. Wanda, maybe due to the shock, shook it without complaint. </span></p><p><span>“Agatha…Rio…what are-how do you…sorry, why are you both here?” She looked between them and her son, mystified at what was going on. </span></p><p><span>“I’m studying at Radcliffe and ran into William a while ago. He recognized me out of nowhere - it was a real blast from the past.” Rio explained. “I reunited with Agatha not long after and was just showing her around.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh, what a coincidence. You two look…great. Well, ummm…we should really get going, right Billy? We have dinner reservations.” Wanda was uncomfortably looking for any way out of this interaction. </span></p><p><span>“Wait, mom. Don’t you want to catch up with your old teammates? How long has it been since you saw them?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha could tell the boy was trying to get her to stay, “Yeah, what have you been up to, Red? How’s New Jersey?”</span></p><p><span>Wanda checked her watch, “I’m fine. Jersey’s fine. We really should get going. I don’t want to bother you both anymore. Billy…” She insisted and started to pull him away. </span></p><p><span>Rio spoke up, “Do you need a ride to the restaurant? We’re heading that way soon. I can give you a ride - save you some taxi fare.”</span></p><p><span>“No, thank you. I have my car. Nice seeing you.” Wanda turned to go, frustrated that her son didn’t seem to be taking her cues. </span></p><p><span>“Mom!” William stomped his foot dramatically. Rio and Agatha side-eyed each other. Where was this going? Wanda froze and faced them again. A simmering, well-concealed rage was pulsing off her in a way that made them all pause. </span></p><p><span>She re-approached slowly, the knuckles holding her small handbag were ghost white. </span></p><p><span>“I’m trying to tell you something!” He was almost shaking with a mix of frustration and nerves. </span></p><p><span>All three women looked at him in stunned silence. </span></p><p><span>“I’m queer.” He said with force but not enough volume to attract attention from passersby.</span></p><p><span>“Billy!” Wanda gasped.</span></p><p><span>“I’ve wanted to tell you for a long time. I was going to tell you at dinner but god, I just need this weight off my chest.” He attempted to stand tall in the face of his terrifying mother. Despite her short statue and immaculate housewife prestige, Wanda had a powerful aura that radiated off her like rays off the sun. </span></p><p><span>The redhead turned to Agatha immediately, “Did you put him up to this?”</span></p><p><span>“WHAT?” Agatha replied, her attempt at pleasantries dissolving. </span></p><p><span>“Mom, they’ve been helping me! They told me about their relationship. Rio has been so nice to me. They understand!” William stepped up to defend them. </span></p><p><span>“I don’t want to talk about this anymore.” Wanda shook her head, setting her jaw. </span></p><p><span>“Hey, your kid is trying to tell you about his life. Be grateful he wants you to know him at all.” Agatha said. She would give anything to be in Wanda’s position. </span></p><p><span>“This is none of your business!” She snapped. “William, we’re going.” </span></p><p><span>“I’m sorry.” He whispered to Agatha as he trailed after his mom who was already stomping away in her heels. </span></p><p><span>They watched the two retreat in silence. </span></p><p><span>“That went about as well as I expected…” Agatha said. </span></p><p><span>Rio felt so bad for the kid. He was so desperate for his mother’s approval. “She might come around. For his sake, I hope so.”</span></p><hr/><p><span>The end of the school year approached without much fanfare. Rio was too enthralled with Agatha to stress about her courses. It was like the first time all over again. The honeymoon stage was a beautiful respite from her student life. Having (mostly) uninterrupted privacy in Agatha’s gorgeous abode made things infinitely easier than their baseball days. </span></p><p><span>They spent long evenings in the clawfoot tub, racing the candle wicks in the bathroom. Agatha taught Rio how to cook her favorite dishes, and Rio taught Agatha her own childhood recipes from her aunt. They cuddled on the couch and enjoyed tuning into </span><em><span>The Beverly Hillbillies </span></em><span>each week. </span></p><p><span>Rio loved Agatha’s bed the most. They sometimes closed the violet curtains and pretended to be in another world. One where nobody could see or judge them. Where they screamed each other’s names in ecstasy and unabashed pleasure. Where they felt like inventors, coming up with new and novel ways to make the other beg. </span></p><p><span>“Do you think we’ll ever get tired of this?” Rio asked one morning while laying naked and spread eagle in the middle of the large bed. The summer sun peeked through the ornate curtains that were slightly open. </span></p><p><span>Agatha was tucked into her side, recovering from her own orgasm, “I didn’t know I still had this in me.”</span></p><p><span>Rio kissed the top of her head sweetly, “You act like you’re on death’s door. You still have lots of life left, baby.”</span></p><p><span>“Not if you keep working my body like this. I don’t know if my heart can take all this exertion.” She joked. </span></p><p><span>The doorbell rang. </span></p><p><span>They looked at each other for a moment in confusion. Who could be here at this hour?</span></p><p><span>“If that boy is back and interrupting our morning sex routine, so help me…” Agatha groaned, covering her head with a pillow. </span></p><p><span>Rio sprung up and grabbed one of Agatha’s many house robes that hung on the back of the door. She rushed downstairs. Catching a glimpse of herself in the mirror by the door, she quickly tried to make herself look presentable. </span></p><p><span>She opened the door and locked eyes with Wanda. </span></p><p><span>“Uhhh…hello.” Rio was stunned. She hadn’t expected to ever see the redhead again. </span></p><p><span>“Rio? I thought this was Agatha’s home?” </span></p><p><span>“I moved in a few weeks ago.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh.” She took in the robe and the very obvious hickeys on Rio’s neck. “Ohhhhhh.”</span></p><p><span>“Do you want to come in?” Rio asked as Wanda looked increasingly flustered. </span></p><p><span>“I should go. I’m so sorry for interrupting…umm… your morning. I’ll come back at a better time.” She resembled an anxious pomeranian, so out of sorts and ready to bolt. </span></p><p><span>As Wanda began to leave, Rio heard heavy footsteps descending behind her, “Get in here, Red.” Agatha’s voice was strong and didn’t invite any objection. </span></p><p><span>Wanda crossed the threshold into their house. Rio smirked as Agatha flitted into the living room, her green and purple floral robe flowing behind her. She was pissed. </span></p><p><span>“You Maximoffs have some awful timing.” Agatha noted as she gestured for them all to sit. Rio and her took the main couch, and Wanda sat across in the vintage wingback chair. </span></p><p><span>“I’m sorry. I haven’t been sleeping well. Billy gave me your address, but I didn’t know that Rio would be here. Are you two…still…together?”</span></p><p><span>“Come on, Wanda. Did you come here just to shame us again? Why are you actually here?” Agatha cut to the chase. She didn’t have patience for a lecture from a homophobe this early in the morning. </span></p><p><span>“I wanted to apologize.” Wanda began. </span></p><p><span>Agatha looked to Rio. Of all the things she expected to hear, an apology was not top of the list. </span></p><p><span>Wanda continued, “I’ve been thinking. Billy explained everything - how long he had felt this way, how he reconnected with you, Rio, how you two are together now, how he is dating a boy at school named Eddie. I didn’t realize. I just never considered…”</span></p><p><span>“That it could happen to your own kid?” Agatha wasn’t pulling any punches. Rio put a comforting hand on her thigh. </span></p><p><span>Wanda grit her teeth, “No. I never considered the complexity of the situation. It’s not like Billy would ever choose to live this way.”</span></p><p><span>“Some research suggests that it’s not a ‘choice’ at all, that we are simply born like this.” Rio added. She didn’t want to go into full detail, but she had spent a great deal of time using the extensive Radcliffe and Harvard libraries to research the topic of sexuality in general. </span></p><p><span>“I guess I just wanted to say, it wasn’t fair how I treated you back in the league. I wasn’t thinking about your feelings at all.”</span></p><p><span>“Oh wow, so now you realize that I’m a person with thoughts and feelings. Congrats. Was that it? We would like to get back to our life if it’s all the same.” Agatha said. </span></p><p><span>Wanda shifted uncomfortably in the chair, eyes shifting between Rio and Agatha, “Can I just ask…are you happy? Do you think Billy has a chance to…you know…have a happy life?” There was the smallest shimmer of tears on her eyeline. </span></p><p><span>Rio felt Agatha’s hand drop down and squeeze her own. She tried to separate the resentment towards Wanda and the obviously hurting mother in front of her. “I’m happier than I’ve ever been. Agatha makes me so happy that I could cry. She’s the best thing in my life by far. I don’t know what’s going to happen with Billy’s life, but he’s a smart kid. His future might look different than you once imagined, but that doesn’t mean it will be sad or loveless. He’ll face more challenges, sure, but he has just as much a chance of falling in love as anyone else.” </span></p><p><span>“Look, Red.” Agatha decided to show a little compassion, “I don’t forgive you for how you treated me. It was needlessly cruel and made me feel like shit for years and years. I married a man to try to forget the part of myself that loved Rio, but it never went away. It didn’t matter how hard I tried to act like everyone else. Once you experience a love that captures your soul, there is no going back.” </span></p><p><span>Rio’s heart felt as light as air. She leaned over and kissed Agatha on the cheek. It was so nice to hear those feelings voiced aloud. She was never letting this woman go. </span></p><p><span>Wanda opened up her purse and pulled out a small card, “I don’t know how I was so blind before. The love you have for each other is written all over your faces. Billy would be lucky to find someone who loves him like that.” She handed over the paper to Agatha. “Here’s my address in New Jersey and my number. Billy insisted that I invite you for Thanksgiving even though it is months away.”</span></p><p><span>“We’ll think about it.” Agatha played with the paper in her hand and stood up. </span></p><p><span>Wanda stood as well and shook both their hands, “Thanks for seeing me. I did wonder whether or not you’d slam the door in my face.”</span></p><p><span>“If I had been the one to answer instead of Rio, I might have.” Agatha said with a smile. </span></p><hr/><p><span>The last week of Agatha’s school year also meant the final game for her softball team this year. They were facing Brookline College for the state championship and to try to defend their title. This team was one of her strongest, even though they lacked any superstars, the group really supported one another. </span></p><p><span>Rio helped at every practice she could make it to when she wasn’t busy catching up with her friends or reading the latest in vaccine research from her former colleagues at the CDC. Though she couldn’t pitch underhand, she still had valuable advice on managing the game as a pitcher, how to read a batter, and how to work the infield. The girls hung on her every word of advice. </span></p><p><span>At the championship game, she sat in the bleachers on the home team side. As she wasn’t school staff, she wasn’t technically allowed in the dugout or on the field, and as it was the final game, several administrators and other teachers were in attendance. Agatha was dressed in a copy of the team shirt and cap, though she had on a pair of long capri shorts instead of baseball pants. Rio enjoyed the view as she watched her favorite coach shake the hand of the opposition before the game kicked off. </span></p><p><span>“Let’s go Knights!” The crowd cheered for the girls as they were first out in the field. Rio clapped and gave a secret smile to Agatha, who turned to find her in the crowd. </span></p><p><span>The starting pitcher, Donna, was a firecracker. Rio was impressed by her control as a teenager. She didn’t think she had that kind of accuracy at that age. It was a shame that her career would peak and end in high school. There were no college softball leagues or professional leagues anymore in the country. </span></p><p><span>The first batter popped out to the left fielder, and then Donna struck out the second batter. The third out came from a solid grounder to short that was thrown hard to first to beat the runner. Rio applauded the great defensive inning. Agatha had trained them so well. </span></p><p><span>Brookline were tough competitors, and they weren’t going to make this easy. Their pitcher had some heat on her pitches and was able to paint the corners of the strike zone. </span></p><p><span>“Swing away, Jane! You got this.” Agatha gave words of encouragement to the lead-off batter. </span></p><p><span>Rio bit her lip. She didn’t know how Agatha did this. It was nerve-wracking watching these young players. She wanted them to succeed so badly. Her breath hitched on the first swing and miss, but luckily the batter connected on the next strike and sent the ball flying for a base hit. </span></p><p><span>They couldn’t send the runner home by inning’s end, but the Knights were looking strong at the plate. In the next four innings, they put four runs on the board and the opposing team was only able to score one. </span></p><p><span>‘Let’s hold them. Stay ready out there!” Agatha called out as the team jogged out to the field again. </span></p><p><span>And they did. The team did not allow any more runs and were able to keep their lead. </span></p><p><span>On the last play of the ninth inning, when the umpire called the final out, the entire team took off their mitts and threw them in the air like graduation caps. Agatha was rushed by the entire team and dogpiled onto the ground as they all tackled the coach with love and gratitude. Rio watched Agatha get up slowly, knowing her knees were probably cracking, and took in the genuine smile on her face. She looked so happy as the team jumped and celebrated around her - running circles around the field like wild rabbits. </span></p><p><span>Agatha waved her over, and Rio stepped over the other parents to get down to the gate. She walked in and congratulated all the girls that passed her. The pitchers ran over and hugged her and thanked her so much for all her guidance. Rio did her best to accept the compliments despite her internal struggles. Agatha came over and wrapped her up in a quick hug. </span></p><p><span>“Congratulations, my love.” Rio whispered in her ear for the second time in her life. </span></p><p><span>Agatha was called over to collect the trophy for the team. Rio watched her lift it high over her head with the help of the team captain. The local newspaper snapped several photos. It was a beautiful celebration to end the season. Rio could not tear her eyes off Agatha, who was a crying, smiling mess. She gave her all for these kids - how could Rio not be smitten?</span></p><p><span>Once everyone had cleared out. All the parents had collected their children and all the friends had driven off into the night. Agatha and Rio were left alone, in the dugout as she packed up the team bats and catcher gear. Rio helped gather up the spare softballs into a bucket. </span></p><p><span>“Another win to add to your collection. Has it lost its shine yet?” Rio asked. </span></p><p><span>Agatha zipped up her bag, “I don’t think it ever will. Seeing their faces when they win - nothing compares.”</span></p><p><span>“Seeing your face when you win was pretty damn special.” Rio said. </span></p><p><span>“Aww shut up. Can you grab those paper cups as well? The parks cleaner will have my neck if we leave any trash in here.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha bent down to grab a forgotten pack of chewing gum. When she turned to throw it away, she almost fell over. </span></p><p><span>Rio was standing right behind her. </span></p><p><span>A black velvet box was sitting on display in her closed, outstretched hand. </span></p><p><span>“Rio…what are you…” Agatha dropped the gum and covered her mouth. This wasn’t happening - surely not. </span></p><p><span>“I know this might seem sudden. I know this is insane and not even recognized by any state in this country but…I don’t care. I don’t care that it’s only been a few months. I don’t care what anyone thinks. I don’t want to spend another minute on this Earth not married to you.” Rio opened the box to reveal a jaw-dropping diamond ring. The gasp that was pulled from Agatha’s throat was worth every penny. </span></p><p><span>She continued, “I’ve been carrying this in my bag and trying to think of the perfect way to propose. I knew it couldn’t be in a restaurant or in a public place. I didn’t want this to be marred by the judgement of strangers. Then, I saw the elation you experienced here tonight and knew it couldn’t be anywhere else. </span></p><p><span>The baseball field is where we met. It’s where we experienced the best and worst of our relationship. It’s where I fell in love with you the first time and where I’ve fallen in love with you again.”</span></p><p><span>Rio bent down on one knee. Agatha choked out a sob. She hadn’t cried at either of her two previous proposals despite wanting them at the time. This one felt different. It was the one she never saw coming, the one that her heart had been waiting for.  </span></p><p><span>“Agatha Harkness. Will you do me the honor of being mine for the rest of my life?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha laughed her signature cackle, “You impatient little…” She wiped her eyes and went over to rummage in her game bag. She was muttering to herself as Rio was left confused, still waiting on one knee. She could hear “ruined”, “god damn”, “should have known” being said under Agatha’s breath. </span></p><p><span>“Sweetheart, you okay?” Rio asked worried about what was going on. </span></p><p><span>Agatha came back and kneeled down in front of her. She revealed her own little box from behind her back. “You just had to get the jump on me.” She opened the box to present her own engagement ring to Rio. It was a thin silver band with a circular jade stone set in the center. </span></p><p><span>Rio dropped her head forward with a laugh. This was ridiculous. This was perfect.</span></p><p><span>“I think you’ve waited long enough for me. So let </span><b>me</b><span> be the one to ask - Rio, will you marry me?”</span></p><p><span>Rio threw her arms around Agatha’s neck and kissed her. “YES! A thousand times, yes.” She leaned back and watched Agatha slip the ring onto her finger. It was as satisfying as the feeling of placing the final puzzle piece. </span></p><p><span>Agatha (with some effort) pulled them both up to standing. She thought winning the championship had felt good, but that joy was only a fraction of what she felt right now. “Alright, show me my ring again.” She held out her hand. </span></p><p><span>Rio pulled out the ring and placed it gingerly on her love’s finger, sealing it with a kiss like a charming prince out of a film. </span></p><p><span>“Where did you get this?” Agatha held it up to her eyes to examine the beautiful gem. </span></p><p><span>Rio shyly shrugged, “It’s a diamond from the ‘54 NY Giants World Series ring.” </span></p><p><span>Rio knew that Agatha’s team was the Red Sox. But the Giants, specifically the 1954 Giants, were a very very close second, and only because they were the team to break the Yankees five-year World Series winning streak. </span></p><p><span>Agatha’s mouth fell open, “What the actual hell?? How?!”</span></p><p><span>“One of the assistants in my biochem class. Her mom used to go steady with the back-up catcher on that winning team. She got to talking to me when I told her I used to play ball and said the ring just sits gathering dust on her mom’s office shelf. Apparently, he gifted it to her when they were dating and never came back to collect it! I asked if I could have it, even offered to pay, but she brought it to class the next day and gave it to me for free. I got it re-set at the jeweller and well, here it is.”</span></p><p><span>“I cannot believe you.” Agatha admired the ring. She liked the look of it initially, but now knowing what Rio did to get it and its history, she loved it. </span></p><p><span>“And you remembered what I asked for…all those years ago. A jade ring.” Rio was beyond touched. </span></p><p><span>“I wrote it down in my journal. I kept extensive notes on all those leagues years and have been re-reading them lately now that you got me feeling all nostalgic.” Agatha admitted. </span></p><p><span>They hugged again and couldn’t believe they had both had the same idea to propose. It fit for them. Always in competition, always trying to one up the other. </span></p><p><span>“Are we being crazy? Is it wise to marry someone you’ve only been dating for such a short time?” Agatha asked as they walked together to her car. She was still longingly staring at the ring, holding her hand in front of her to show it off. </span></p><p><span>“It’s not like we’re strangers anyway. I’ve been wishing for this for well over a decade. I’m not some naive kid - you’re all that I want.” Rio opened the passenger door for her fiancée. Who said chivalry was dead?</span></p><p><span>Agatha threw her bag and the trophy in the backseat, then sat inside, “Peggy is going to lose her mind. Oh god, she’s going to go wild with wedding planning.” </span></p><p><span>Rio closed the door and rushed around to the driver’s side, “She better not try to get me in a white dress.”</span></p><p><span>“If you try to get married in a Cubs jersey, so help me…” Agatha warned. </span></p><p><span>Rio laughed heartily, “I hadn’t considered that but now that you’ve suggested it, it’s not a bad idea.”</span></p><p><span>“Rio.”</span></p><p><span>“Agatha, I’m only getting married once. Don’t stifle me!” </span></p><p><span>The two held hands the entire drive back to their home. Rio relished the feeling of the ring sitting snugly on Agatha’s finger. They were together. They were happy. </span></p><p><span>They were getting married.</span></p>

<blockquote><p><span>“I don’t think anybody in the league had any thought of women in the future while we were playing...but a good portion of the women have been in sports all of these years in one capacity or another, as teachers, instructors, or coaches. They all have added to supporting girls and women in sports throughout their lifetimes.”</span></p><p><span>Jeneane DesCombes</span></p></blockquote><p> </p><p><span>When Agatha broke the news of her engagement to her best friend that weekend, Peggy screamed so loud that the neighbor pounded on the door and asked if he should call the police. </span></p><p><span>“Show me the ring! Show me the ring!” She hollered after finally convincing Mr. Preston that they were fine. </span></p><p><span>Agatha explained the story, which caused Peggy to immediately break down in tears, “That is just about the sweetest thing I’ve ever heard. I knew I should have married a woman.” </span></p><p><span>Jen also cried when Rio broke the news over the phone, even though she’ll never admit it. “I just have allergies!” She tried to say, but Rio knew her friend was overjoyed. She’d been listening to non-stop Agatha pining for months now and was glad that they were finally sealing the deal.  </span></p><p><span>Rio wished she could tell her aunt and uncle and her cousins but knew realistically, they’d never understand. It wasn’t worth jeopardizing their relationship, which hurt like hell but there wasn’t any alternative. Agatha would be described as her dear friend, and that would have to be enough. </span></p><p><span>Peggy planned it all - from the date down to the font choice on the invites. It was billed as a ‘celebration’ but everyone knew that this was a wedding. They waited until the end of October when the weather cooled off to give Peggy enough time to arrange it all. </span></p><p><span>For the venue, they chose the Commander’s Mansion along the river in Watertown - a Civil War-era building that hosted large events. It was beautiful, historic, and best of all, secluded. To Rio it looked like a few of the old hotels they used to stay at on the road when they played ball, when they used to sleep wrapped up in each other in squeaky old twin beds. </span></p><p><span>Agatha didn’t want fancy catering, so she convinced Steve to grill up hot dogs and burgers for everyone instead. In lieu of gifts, the guests brought along a plate of their favorite ballpark snacks to share, so the reception was full of Cracker Jacks, peanuts, and bowls of candy. Peggy scoured old address books and went searching high and low to get out the invites to people from both of their pasts. The brides honestly did not know who she had invited until the day of.</span></p><p><span>Jen drove in from New York to help Rio pick her outfit and prepare. Alice was also on hand to assist with fashion advice. Rio had absolutely zero desire to wear a white dress like some Betty Sue. She went with a suit, which was quickly becoming a popular fashion trend. It had a dog tooth double-breasted coat that she wore over a pressed white shirt with black tie, a pair of slim black cigarette pants, and shiny loafers.  </span></p><p><span>Agatha had circled the dress she wanted in the Sears catalog weeks prior - a forest green, party dress with chiffon skirt and a lace top with three-quarter sleeves. It had a stylish belt with a rhinestone buckle that gave that hint of sparkle that she loved. She had done the boring bridal outfit twice before, now she was going to wear what she wanted. </span></p><p><span>For the ‘something old’, she pinned her mother’s broach to her collar - the lock of Nicky’s hair was snug and safe inside. For ‘something new’, Rio had bought her a pair of pearl earrings to match the necklace she loved. For ‘something borrowed’, Peggy clasped on the silver bracelet that she had worn at her own wedding. And for ‘something blue’, Agatha rolled on the blue lace garter that she’d purchased as a surprise for Rio on their wedding night. </span></p><p><span>William was the flower boy and tossed beautiful petals to the enjoyment of the crowd. </span></p><p><span>They walked each other down the aisle. </span></p><p><span>The weather decided to cooperate or maybe it just bent to Agatha’s will because somehow in the middle of fall there was not a cloud in the sky and no hint of rain. The leaves were beautiful reds and oranges as they stood outside on the lawn beneath the wedding arch.</span></p><p><span>As they made their way down the rows of chairs they spotted so many familiar faces. Dottie and Lupe from the Comets. Greta and Carson - still clearly holding hands and beaming. Steve sitting with his son JJ. His and Peggy’s daughter, Sandra, was taking the photos of the event. </span></p><p><span>Wanda with a young man who must be William’s twin, Tommy. Jen and Alice. A handful of Agatha’s more progressive teacher friends from over the years. Some of Rio’s classmates who Alice knew were queer as well. To Rio’s surprise, her middle cousin, Chris, was there too - waving at her from the front row. It was a real hodge podge of people all coming together to support them. </span></p><p><span>Peggy officiated. </span></p><p><span>“We gather here today for the union of these two people, Agatha and Rio. The road here has been wild and weary, but they finally made it. There were plenty of detours, hazards, and long delays in this journey, yet somehow, the road always led them back together. </span></p><p><span>I had the pleasure, or perhaps a better word is frustration, of watching these two first meet fifteen years ago when we were all playing baseball.” </span></p><p><span>Dottie in the crowd gave a huge holler and shout at that. </span></p><p><span>Peggy laughed and continued, “Yes, Go Comets! And although there was clearly an immediate attraction, it was not love at first sight. I used to room with Agatha and had to hear her bitch and moan about the pitcher who almost took her head off for weeks. It wasn’t until I gave Agatha a real push that she realized Rio wasn’t out to get her, Rio was actually completely in love with her. From then on, they were inseparable. I’m just glad I never walked in on them in any compromising positions.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha noticeably blushed and playfully swatted at Peggy, who kept on undeterred, “When they broke up, it was a right shame. Agatha was a mess for months, for years really. I watched her struggle and try to hide it, but I could tell she missed Rio, even though she was too proud to say so. I almost couldn’t believe it when Rio showed up out of nowhere earlier this year - looking as smitten as ever despite the years gone by. It’s been amazing to see my best friend happy again, truly, truly happy. I wish you both nothing but the best in the future. I believe you’ve written your own vows?”</span></p><p><span>Agatha nodded and composed herself. She didn’t think Peggy’s speech would affect her so much. She held Rio’s hands tightly and stared into her favorite dark brown eyes. </span></p><p><span>“I always thought there were three loves of my life. Three irrefutable parts of my heart. Baseball, the Red Sox, and Nicky. I was grateful. I thought I had won, you know? Some people hope and pray for one love. And I got three. </span></p><p><span>I stopped hoping for any more. Baseball has been the constant. It changed the entire course of my life and continues to surprise and delight me. The Red Sox will always let me down, but I’ll be there cheering and screaming until the day I die. My son went to sleep early but lives on in my memory. I thought that those three things were enough. </span></p><p><span>Until you showed up out of the blue. I had learned to live without you. I had forgotten the way that you make me feel. But suddenly, you were back, and I was 35 and stupidly in love with the rookie pitcher from Florida all over again. </span></p><p><span>You see me. You accept all my flaws, and I know there are many. You listen, you care, you are everything I’ve ever wanted in a partner. I thought I was lucky to have three loves, but now I know I don’t have three, I’ve won the lottery and have four. </span></p><p><span>I love baseball. I love the Red Sox. I love my son. And I love you.”</span></p><p><span>Rio was crying freely now. It was unstoppable after hearing that. She didn’t know how she was going to get her words out but needed to say them now. She took a deep breath and unfolded the paper where she had scrawled her vows. </span></p><p><span>“I knew I was different from the other girls very early. All I wanted for Christmas was a baseball mitt, and every other girl in my class was asking for a new baby doll or new dresses. I felt separate my entire life until I put on my first baseball uniform. I was part of a team. I felt like I belonged. </span></p><p><span>Then you had to go and make me fall in love with you. I know it was more like hate at first sight from your point of view, but I was obsessed from the first time I saw you in a magazine. When we finally kissed after months of dancing around each other, I knew it was over for me. I was going to be addicted forever. I had finally found where I actually belonged. </span></p><p><span>I hate the way things ended between us. There were many sleepless nights spent wishing I could have changed something, anything, to prevent hurting you. For fifteen years, I focussed on my studies and my work. I thought if I could pour myself into something productive the hurt would go away. I was kidding myself. </span></p><p><span>You are my beginning. You are my end. I want to watch you coach softball games, host dinner parties, and throw snacks at the TV when your team loses. I want to be by your side for it all. I can’t promise I’ll ever cheer on the Red Sox, but I know we’ll have tickets to Fenway if they ever make the postseason. </span></p><p><span>I loved you when you hated me. I loved you when you were gone. I love you now and forever.”</span></p><p><span>Agatha was a mess. She was so in love with this woman that she felt like she was going to burst. Her tears were the outpouring of all the pent-up emotions. Rio passed over her pocket square (which Agatha now realized was emblazoned with the Chicago Cubs logo), and she did her best to keep her makeup from smudging. </span></p><p><span>As she passed it back, she leaned forward and moved for a kiss before Peggy stuck her hand in between them. </span></p><p><span>“Ah ah ah, wait for the magic words.” She glared at Agatha. “First, exchange rings.” </span></p><p><span>Jen stood up and handed the boxes to Peggy. They had picked out two simple gold wedding bands from the local jeweller. Agatha had a fun time lying to the shop owner that she was getting married to her favorite baseball player, left fielder of the Sox, Carl Yastrzemski. Rio let her have her fun. She loved watching Agatha ham it up and lie to the gullible.</span></p><p><span>As they slipped the bands onto each other’s fingers. Rio knew that she was never going to forget this moment. It was symbolic of everything they had gone through. Time was a circle, and no matter what, there was no end to her love for her catcher, her Agatha. </span></p><p><span>“Okay, </span><em><span>now</span></em><span>, by the power vested in me by…uhh you two lovebirds, I now pronounce you wives. You may now kiss!” Peggy declared. </span></p><p><span>They both stared at each other and grinned. Agatha yanked Rio’s hands that she was holding and pulled her wife towards her. Their lips moved together in shared abandon as they sealed their fate in one glorious kiss. The onlookers cheered until they separated and lifted their locked hands in joyful celebration. Sandra snapped a beautiful photo of the look of pure bliss as they exited the aisle together after the ceremony. </span></p><p><span>The reception in the manor was joyous and filled with well-wishes for the happy couple. </span></p><p><span>“What the hell took you two so long?” Greta shoved herself between them both and put her arms around their shoulders. </span></p><p><span>“What the hell are you and Carson even doing here?” Agatha asked back. She hadn’t seen them since leaving the Comets.</span></p><p><span>“We got an invite in the mail and knew we couldn’t miss it.” </span></p><p><span>“And you two have been together all this time?” Rio asked.</span></p><p><span>Carson nodded, “Hardly a day apart ever since I left my husband in ‘54 when the league shut down. I realized I didn’t want Greta only a few months of the year anymore. I wanted her 365 days a year.”</span></p><p><span>“Awwww, isn’t she adorable?” Greta swooned and moved to go hug her partner. “Now that open bar is calling our name - we’ll catch up later, yeah?”</span></p><p><span>“We’ll be around.” Rio agreed as they watched them skip away to the bar. </span></p><p><span>“Angel!” A voice called out - now there was a nickname, they hadn’t heard in a while. </span></p><p><span>“Dottie, how are you?” Agatha greeted their old teammate. </span></p><p><span>“Right as rain, darling. How did I not know that you and Rio were going steady? Was I living under a rock?” </span></p><p><span>“We tried to be discreet. What have you been up to? Are you married?” Agatha could only see the charming young twenty something from the old days. It was hard to reconcile the put-together, beautiful 40 year old in front of her. </span></p><p><span>Dottie held up her hand to show off a big ol’ rock on her finger, “Got hitched when I was 26 to a boy from my hometown. Popped out three little anklebiters who are both the light of my life and bane of my existence at times. I work part-time at the local sporting goods store, which gives me a nice break from their constant needs.”</span></p><p><span>“And you don’t mind that Rio and I are…queer?” </span></p><p><span>Dottie laughed, “Not all southerners are close-minded, ya know? Only God can judge and if he made you this way, then who am I to complain?” </span></p><p><span>“Amen!” Agatha voiced her agreement - unused to religious acceptance in any form. </span></p><p><span>Lupe approached and practically jumped on Rio, “Hey Reaper, congrats!!” </span></p><p><span>“Thanks, Lupe. Never thought I’d see you again.” Rio hugged her fellow pitcher. </span></p><p><span>“I don’t even know how Peggy tracked me down. All I know is I got a letter in the mail, and I sure needed a break from work.”</span></p><p><span>“What do you do?”</span></p><p><span>“Got a factory job at General Motors in Detroit. Long hours but the pay is tops.”</span></p><p><span>“You always were a hard worker. Got a special gal in your life?” Rio asked. </span></p><p><span>“I never was a one woman girl.” Lupe winked and tipped her cap as she walked off. </span></p><p><span>Peggy interrupted and pulled the brides over to the cake table. She had baked a two tier chocolate cake with white frosting. Someone had gotten crafty and painted the brides on top so their dresses resembled the Comets green uniforms - complete with Rio and Agatha’s numbers on the back. </span></p><p><span>“Did Steve add his artistic touch?” Agatha pointed to the figures and asked Peggy. </span></p><p><span>“I made him contribute something besides being grillmaster.” Peggy admitted. “Now grab the knife, let’s cut this cake.”</span></p><p><span>Rio and Agatha stood side by side and held the comically large blade to slice into the cake. They each took a small piece. Agatha had warned that if Rio tried to smash any of it into her face, she would pay for it later. </span></p><p><span>Unluckily for her, Rio was a glutton for punishment and shoved the decadent frosting dessert straight into Agatha’s mouth, muffling her scream. </span></p><p><span>Everyone watched with bated breath as Agatha stood stock still for a moment, Rio also frozen in instant regret, before her wife grabbed a fistful of cake and returned the favor. Peggy quickly stepped in to stop it dissolving into a full-on food fight and took over plating pieces for the guests. </span></p><p><span>“I warned you.” Agatha whispered quietly as she passed over some napkins. </span></p><p><span>Rio swiped her finger across Agatha’s chin to clean up some frosting and sucked it clean, “I can’t wait.”</span></p><p><span>“You are sick.” Agatha tried to lick up the cake stuck around her mouth. </span></p><p><span>“Don’t pretend you don’t love bossing me around.” Rio grinned and showed off her chocolatey teeth. </span></p><p><span>Her cousin, Chris, came over and grabbed a slice, “Never thought I’d ever see you get married.” He joked. </span></p><p><span>“How did you get roped into coming?” Rio asked. She didn’t think any of family would be here. She’d told Peggy in advance that Chris was the only one who might be okay with it. They’d always been the closest. </span></p><p><span>“Got a letter with your name on in inviting me up to Boston. Seeing as you don’t invite us up here for anything else, figured I should take the chance to finally see where you live.” Chris said.. </span></p><p><span>“Are you going to tell the rest of la familia?” Rio couldn’t bear the thought of her family disowning her or refusing to speak to her. </span></p><p><span>“Don’t worry little cuz - you’re secret’s safe with me. I think a few of the boys might be jealous if they saw how smoking hot your wife is.”</span></p><p><span>“Hey, don’t be checking out my girl.” Rio attempted to cover his eyes. </span></p><p><span>He ducked out of her reach, keeping a steady hand on his cake. “Let’s just say I’m impressed. I didn’t know you could pull like that.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m flattered.”</span></p><p><span>“Attention, attention. Can the newlyweds please make their way to the main parlor for their first dance?” Peggy’s loud voice called out. </span></p><p><span>Rio found Agatha, who was animatedly talking to some other teachers, and they walked together to the large front room that had a record player and speakers. It had been cleared of most other furniture to create a makeshift dancefloor. The guests lined the walls as Peggy dropped the needle on the record. </span></p><p><em><span>You sigh, the song begins</span></em></p><p><em><span>You speak and I hear violins</span></em></p><p><em><span>It's magic</span></em></p><p><span>Rio thought she had already cried enough but hearing this classic Doris Day tune again transported her right back to a secret hidden bar in Rockford where they first danced together in public. Agatha held her close with her arms around Rio’s neck, their bodies moving slowly together around the floor. </span></p><p><em><span>The stars desert the skies</span></em></p><p><em><span>And rush to nestle in your eyes</span></em></p><p><em><span>It's magic</span></em></p><p><span>“I used to turn the radio off whenever this song came on.” Agatha confessed. </span></p><p><span>“I don’t think I’ve heard it since. I did purposely avoid Doris Day records at the store whenever I was browsing though.” Rio held tightly to Agatha’s hips. </span></p><p><span>They danced together like nobody was watching, like it was just them alone with this song. </span></p><p><em><span>Without a golden wand</span></em></p><p><em><span>Or mystic charms,</span></em></p><p><em><span>Fantastic things begin</span></em></p><p><em><span>When I am in your arms</span></em></p><p><span>From then on, they would spend each anniversary dancing to “It’s Magic” and be able to relive both their first dances together. </span></p><p><span>Each year of their relationship was somehow better and better. </span></p><hr/><p><b>1964</b></p><p><span>Rio graduated with her doctorate and was immediately snapped up by Merck as part of their vaccine research team. To Agatha’s dismay, the head office was located in Rahway, New Jersey, so they decided to sell the Boston house and move. </span></p><p><span>Wanda had come around to the idea of them together after being at their wedding and was thrilled at the close proximity. She was a frequent dinner guest and a surprisingly good gossip. She kept them abreast of all of Tommy and William’s frequently changing relationships.</span></p><p><span>She currently hated the boy named Richard that William was seeing. Apparently, he had crashed William’s car and was refusing to pay for the damage. Wanda was ready to raise hell. Rio advised that William was old enough to handle it on his own. </span></p><p><span>Agatha hated to leave her school in Boston, but teachers are needed everywhere. She was able to easily get a new job at the nearest high school and immediately started a softball team. </span></p><p><span>They won the state championship her first year coaching. </span></p><hr/><p><b>1967</b></p><p><span>New Jersey sucked. </span></p><p><span>They lasted three years before Agatha finally broke and said she missed Massachusetts desperately. According to her, Señor Scratchy also hated Jersey, so they had two votes in favor of moving. Rio wasn’t enjoying the work as her entire team was a group of white men over 50 who dismissed her every suggestion. When her old professor at Radcliffe reached out with a job opportunity for an adjunct teaching position in the biochemistry department, it was an easy decision.</span></p><p><span>They moved back to Boston. This time to Jamaica Plain where they found a charming two bedder with all the historic charm that Agatha loved and the modern amenities that Rio needed. Agatha was back at her old school. Peggy was ecstatic and gifted them season tickets to the Red Sox if they promised to stay. Agatha would take that deal any day. </span></p><p><span>The stands were half empty most of the time, so tickets were dirt cheap regardless. Fenway was as barren as a church on Monday. There’s only so much that fans can deal with before they give up on a team, and Boston had all but given up on the Red Sox. Agatha was not a fair weather fan though, and she gleefully dragged Rio to every home game they could make it to. </span></p><p><span>They had seats five rows back from home plate just to the left. Agatha always preferred the catcher’s view of the game over anywhere else. Rio preferred to be right by Agatha’s side, so it worked out for both of them. </span></p><p><span>In 1967, expectations were as low as ever. The team was coming off eight straight losing seasons, so why should this one be any different?</span></p><p><span>It was different. </span></p><p><span>“Rio, they’re only three games behind the White Sox in the pennant race. We might have a real shot.” Agatha explained as the team continued their impressive performance into August. </span></p><p><span>“Sure, dear - whatever you say.” </span></p><p><span>A few days later as they watched the game on TV, Rio almost dropped a pot of boiling water in the kitchen when Agatha screamed, “FUCK!” so loud that she thought someone was dying. </span></p><p><span>She quickly set the pot back on the stove and ran to the living room, “What, what happened??”</span></p><p><span>“Conigliaro was beaned!”</span></p><p><span>“What?!”</span></p><p><span>“The Angels pitcher hit him right in the face. He’s on the ground, not getting up!” Agatha paced in front of the screen as they watched the star youngster unmoving in the dirt. </span></p><p><span>“Oh no…” Rio saw the kid get lifted onto a stretcher and carried off the field. </span></p><p><span>“There goes our chances.” Agatha fell to the couch in a huff. </span></p><p><span>Despite the setback, the Red Sox kept pushing. They were first in the pennant race for the first time in over two decades and showed no signs of slowing down. All Star Carl “Yaz” Yastrzemski was carrying this team on his back with his league leading home run and hitting records. The stands became packed each game as Red Sox fever swept the town. </span></p><p><span>It was an impossible dream. </span></p><p><span>In October, when the Sox beat the Twins at home to clinch the American League, they secured their first trip to the World Series since the ‘40s. Agatha was over the moon. </span></p><p><span>At game one against the St. Louis Cardinals, Agatha and Rio marvelled at the sold out stadium. They could see people hanging off the billboards across the street to try to get a glimpse of the game. Every seat was filled. The noise was deafening. </span></p><p><span>“Can you believe it? We’re here! We’re really here!” Agatha was buzzing with excitement as the first pitch was thrown. She never thought she’d get to see this happen. </span></p><p><span>Rio enjoyed the game but mostly watched her favorite sight - Agatha watching the Red Sox. She went through every emotion as they watched starting pitcher Jose Santiago (a young Puerto Rican) give his best stuff to the batters. Rio was still undeniably a Cubs fan, but Santiago was no doubt impressive. Unfortunately, the Cards went up early by one, but Santiago got back at them with his own homer. At the end of the game it wasn’t enough, and they lost 2-1. </span></p><p><span>Agatha’s spirit wouldn’t be broken. They got tickets to game two and screamed with the crowd as Yaz crushed two homers and the Sox won 5-0 to tie up the series. </span></p><p><span>“Is this happening? Pinch me, Rio!” Agatha exclaimed as they walked out of the stadium on a high. </span></p><p><span>The Cardinals won the next two games in their home stadium in St. Louis. Boston needed to win game 5 to stay in it. Agatha pulled the couch as close as possible to the TV as they watched it live. She’d taken the day off work and insisted Rio do the same. </span></p><p><span>The team pulled out a win 3-1 to stay alive. Agatha dove on Rio when the final out was called, and they fiercely made out on the floor to Rio’s sheer delight. </span></p><p><span>Game six was another win by Boston and the series was tied three a piece. It all came down to game seven at Fenway. </span></p><p><span>“We’re going.” Agatha declared. Fuck work and any obligations. This was the final game of the World Series. She wasn’t going to miss this for anything. Rio nodded along and called her dean to say she wouldn’t be in. </span></p><p><span>They sat in their usual seats and greeted the familiar faces around them. </span></p><p><span>From the start, Rio could tell the starting pitcher, Jim Lonborg, was struggling. She noted his placement and pitch speed was not his usual, and the Cardinals were pouncing on it. The Red Sox were down 0-2 in the third inning. </span></p><p><span>“Rio, hold my hand.” Agatha grabbed her wife’s hand and would not let go as they watched the impossible dream slip away before their eyes. </span></p><p><span>Boston scored one in the fifth but it was 1-4 at that point. </span></p><p><span>They needed a miracle. </span></p><p><span>Instead, they got a nightmare. Rio watched in horror as Lonborg’s arm became weaker and weaker until in the sixth inning, he pitched into a three-run homer and was pulled from the game. </span></p><p><span>Agatha cried with the other fans as they watched their championship hopes disappear. Rio rubbed the back of her neck and offered the usual condolences, but she didn’t know if the Red Sox would ever get this close again. </span></p><hr/><p><b>1970</b></p><p><span>“Why can’t we go to Miami again?” Rio whined as Agatha packed their suitcases. </span></p><p><span>“My love, we go to Florida every winter to see your family. I want a different sort of vacation!” Agatha folded Rio’s shorts and stacked them in the bag. She’d spent every Christmas in the sunny snowbird escape. She put her foot down this year. </span></p><p><span>“But why are we going to New York? You hate that city!” </span></p><p><span>“No, I hate the damn Yankees. I’ve only been to the city a few times in my life - I want to see a Broadway show.”</span></p><p><span>They arrived in the city at the end of June. It was sweltering amongst the steel and the concrete, but the hustle of the city was intoxicating. Rio was a happy camper as soon as Agatha bought her a street dog and a pretzel. </span></p><p><span>As they walked up 8th Avenue, Rio spotted a familiar face, “Jen?”</span></p><p><span>“About time you visit my city!” Her best friend bounded over to hug her. </span></p><p><span>“What are you doing here?” Rio asked, confused. </span></p><p><span>“Your wife called. Said she got us all tickets to see </span><em><span>Company</span></em><span>. Glad she finally convinced you to give the Big Apple a try.” Jen explained. </span></p><p><span>Rio narrowed her eyes at Agatha, who feigned innocence, “Oh, sorry I surprised you with your oldest friend! My mistake!” </span></p><p><span>“I love you.” Rio shook her head and followed her two favorite people in the world into the theatre. </span></p><p><span>After the show, at a moody bar down the street, Jen invited them to a big march the next day, “There is going to be a huge event to commemorate the Stonewall Riots that happened last year. You should both come. We’re marching from the West Village to Central Park. Some of my coworkers told me about it.”</span></p><p><span>“Is it safe?” Agatha questioned cautiously. She knew the reputation of the NYPD and the gay community. </span></p><p><span>“I heard they are expecting thousands of people. Safety in numbers - they can’t arrest us all.”</span></p><p><span>“I’m in.” Rio agreed. </span></p><p><span>“Alright, what’s that chant going around? We’re here, we’re queer…now somebody buy me a beer.” Agatha joked. </span></p><p><span>“That’s not…you know what, fine, next round is on me.” Jen was just glad to have her friends join her. </span></p><p><span>The Christopher Street Liberation Day march took place on June 28, 1970. It would be recorded in history as one of the first pride marches. The event took half the scheduled time to cover the 51 block route due to excitement and wariness. </span></p><p><span>Rio held Agatha’s hand as they marched alongside the throngs of people. There were people of all ages and races. Folks in custom lambda t-shirts, wearing different pins and badges, holding bold signs and posters. </span></p><p><span>“Wow, you forget sometimes that there are so many others like us.” Agatha marvelled as they followed the crowd. </span></p><p><span>“Times are changing.” Rio smiled and raised their clasped hands to kiss the back of Agatha’s. </span></p><hr/><p><b>1973 </b></p><p><span>“Coach, can you write a letter of recommendation for me?” Kimberley came into Agatha’s classroom after the last bell rang. </span></p><p><span>“What do you need a letter for?”</span></p><p><span>“Texas A&amp;M. They’ve just added softball to their divisional sports program. I might actually have a chance at an athletic scholarship.” </span></p><p><span>The country had passed Title IX legislation the previous year to ban sex-based discrimination in higher education and require schools to offer proportionally equal gender sports programs. For the first time, girls across the country were going to have as much of a chance as the boys to get scholarships and play for top-tier schools. </span></p><p><span>“Of course I’ll write you a letter. You’re one of the best outfielders I’ve coached in years - it’d be a shame to see that cannon of an arm go to waste.” Agatha wrote down in her to-do list to type up a letter as soon as possible. She was overjoyed that her girls were going to have more opportunities to compete in softball past high school. </span></p><p><span>There were still no professional leagues but getting a free or discounted college education was a huge step forward. Hundreds of thousands of girls across the states would benefit from these programs. </span></p><p><span>In the 1940s, only 5% of women in the country had a college degree. The women ballplayers of the All-American league were outliers - with over 35% going on to get higher education degrees after leaving the league. These women, like Agatha, would go out into the world and continue to inspire future generations as many became educators and coaches. </span></p><p><span>By the ‘70s the percentage of women graduates had doubled to 11%, and that number would only grow as the years went on. The ballplayers were some of the first to set the template and show it was possible. </span></p><hr/><p><b>1975 </b></p><p><span>“Her water just broke!” Peggy screamed into the phone. “I’m too young to be a grandmother!” </span></p><p><span>“You’re 62. Sorry babe, that’s grandma age.” Agatha joked. </span></p><p><span>“Shut up, and stay by the phone - I’ll call you when the baby’s born.”</span></p><p><span>Stevie Rose Walsh was born on September 13, 1975 to her overjoyed parents Sandra and her husband Lyle. She was named for her grandfather (and a certain witchy rock singer whose band was blowing up the charts). Peggy and Steve were as proud as any grandparents could be. </span></p><p><span>Rio and Agatha were the first visitors to the hospital. </span></p><p><span>“Look at her little nose!!” Agatha squealed as quietly as she could and admired the baby, who was peacefully sleeping in her mother’s arms. </span></p><p><span>“Congratulations, Sandy. She is beautiful.” Rio added, staring lovingly at the fresh baby. </span></p><p><span>“Thanks, you two. I thought you’d be watching the Sox game, Auntie Agatha.” Sandra looked at the clock on the wall. She somehow knew the game schedule by heart. </span></p><p><span>“I’ll check the score in the paper tomorrow. How often do I get to meet your baby? And anyway I need to indoctrinate this kid early.” Agatha pulled out a Red Sox onesie from her bag and held it up to the baby. “Look, a little ballplayer in the making!”</span></p><p><span>“Don’t worry, I’ll make sure Sandy signs her up for softball as soon as she can walk.” Peggy reassured her friend.</span></p><p><span>The new mother tried to hush them, “Oh stop! She hasn’t even opened her eyes yet. She might not even like The Red Sox!” </span></p><p><span>“She doesn’t have a choice.” Agatha wouldn’t hear any complaints. </span></p><p><span>“I don’t want her falling in love with a losing team. It’s so hard to watch! You cursed me with this fandom - I don’t want my daughter to suffer like I have.” Sandy joked with her aunt and mother. </span></p><p><span>“They’re good this year!” Agatha replied. </span></p><p><span>“You say that every year. If they make it to the World Series again, I’ll raise Stevie as a Red Sox fan. If they don’t, I won’t.”</span></p><p><span>“Deal.” Agatha held out her hand. Sandy unfolded the blanket around Stevie and held out the baby’s delicate little hand. Agatha shook it gently. </span></p><p><span>For only the 3rd time in the last 60 years, the Red Sox made it to the World Series in 1975. </span></p><p><span>A new fan was born. </span></p><hr/><p><b>1979 </b></p><p><span>Agatha retired in 1976 at 64 years old. She was tired of grading papers and dealing with rowdy teens. She got to be home in ‘77 to celebrate with Rio when they got the news that her research into the pneumococcal virus had contributed to the new vaccine that now protected against 14 strains. Her work was going to make a real difference in the world. Agatha couldn’t be prouder. </span></p><p><span>She was restless at home though, so she started volunteering with a local gay and lesbian organization in her free time. The movement was gaining in both acceptance and political power. </span></p><p><span>Throughout her career, she had been grateful to work for principals and with coworkers who were surprisingly not nosy, so nobody questioned her marital status or living situation. Many other teachers and people in every profession were not so lucky. </span></p><p><span>There were no laws to protect against discrimination based on sexuality or in some states to protect against arrest and criminal charges. Employers were free to fire any employee suspected of homosexual behavior. Sodomy laws were still rampant across more conservative states, and police regularly raided businesses that catered to homosexual clientele. </span></p><p><span>William was kicked out of his rental when another tenant reported him to the landlord for suspected “gay activity” (with his boyfriend of five years). Agatha knew several teachers who had been fired and barred from teaching when their sexuality was revealed. </span></p><p><span>By 1979, the gays had had enough. </span></p><p><span>“Rio, they’re marching on Washington.” Agatha informed her wife, who had just gotten home from work. She hadn’t even removed her coat. </span></p><p><span>“Who?”</span></p><p><span>“It’s a national march for lesbian and gay rights. We have to go.”</span></p><p><span>“Book the tickets.” Rio saw the fire in Agatha’s eyes and knew they needed to be there. She knew it was a big deal when Agatha didn’t put up any fight when William invited himself along. </span></p><p><span>Around 100,000 people marched on the National Mall, on the 10th anniversary of Stonewall, to demand equal civil rights and urge the passage of legislation. It would be decades before there would be any progress, but this was one of the first steps on a very long journey ahead. </span></p><hr/><p><b>1986 </b></p><p><span>“Did you see that letter on the table?” Rio asked. </span></p><p><span>“What?” Agatha yelled back. </span></p><p><span>“The letter! On the table!” Rio raised her voice. </span></p><p><span>“The kettle?”</span></p><p><span>“No! The letter!” Rio walked over and picked up the letter and brought it over to her wife, who was again refusing to wear her hearing aids.</span></p><p><span>“Oh, the letter. Why didn’t you just say so?” Agatha adjusted her glasses to read it. “The reunion is in Chicago again?”</span></p><p><span>“Yeah, I don’t know if we can make it. It’s Peggy and Steve’s 40th wedding anniversary that weekend.” </span></p><p><span>“I hate to miss the reunion though. We go every year.”</span></p><p><span>Rose “Horsey” Horstman had started the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League newsletter in 1980 as a way to reconnect all the players after decades of time apart. The league had all but faded into obscurity. Nobody talked about it at all because nobody believed it had happened. When the gals tried to say they got paid to play baseball in the ‘40s, they were laughed at. </span></p><p><span>However, several players kept the memory alive and thanks to meticulous record-keeping at the time, were able to track down and find the over 600 women who once played ball in the league. In 1980, they organized the first reunion in Rockford and decided to make it an annual event. Rio and Agatha tried their best to attend each and every one. </span></p><p><span>“We’ll go next time.” Rio reassured her. Agatha was 74 and still running around like a jackrabbit, although more like a deaf jackrabbit these days. She was showing no signs of slowing down. </span></p><p><span>Plus, Agatha said she wasn’t going to die until she saw the Red Sox win the World Series, and Rio knew how stubborn she was. </span></p><p><span>Part of her wanted Agatha to finally see her team win, but the other part was happy that they kept losing because it gave Agatha an excuse to keep going - not that she needed one. She played in their community slow-pitch softball league each fall, she kept up volunteering with the Gay and Lesbian Task Force, and she helped coach youth teams whenever she could. </span></p><p><span>In 1986, the Red Sox made it to the pinnacle event in baseball again. Rio was conflicted as always, and Agatha was cautiously optimistic. Maybe, just maybe. </span></p><p><span>They were up against the NY Mets. Boston had a killer pitching bullpen with both Roger Clemens and Oil Can Boyd, and an amazing hitting lineup full of veteran talent and young blood. </span></p><p><span>The Red Sox won the first two games away in New York. They were heading to Fenway for game three.</span></p><p><span>Agatha was flying, “Two more. Just two more wins and we’re there!” </span></p><p><span>They were at the game when the Mets won 4-0. Rio had to help Agatha down the many steps to their seats, but she would never give up her tickets. The Sox just didn’t have it in them that day. Agatha was still hopeful. She had all the blind optimism of a life-long fan. </span></p><p><span>Game four was the same. The Mets won decidedly 6-2 thanks to a pair of two-run homers. </span></p><p><span>“Don’t give up hope yet! We can come back. I believe - you just gotta believe, Rio!” Agatha explained on the drive home. </span></p><p><span>The belief paid off when Boston pulled out a win the next game. They just needed one more win. One last win to seal their name in the history books. </span></p><p><span>“Rio, remember what you’re wearing today.” </span></p><p><span>“What, why?”</span></p><p><span>“We need to re-wear these exact outfits on Saturday when we watch game six on TV.”</span></p><p><span>“What? No way!”</span></p><p><span>“Do it for me? Come on, what if this is the lucky charm they need to win?” Agatha was extremely superstitious and did believe in the power of a rally cap and a lucky outfit. </span></p><p><span>That night, they put on their exact same outfits. Rio drew the line at putting on her old underwear - Agatha didn’t, and they sat in the living room with all their fingers and toes crossed for one more win. </span></p><p><span>It looked promising. Boston went up early 2-0. The Mets tied it in the fifth inning, but then Boston drew ahead by one run in the seventh. They just had to hold it. </span></p><p><span>“Come on! Two innings. They can do it!” Agatha held onto Rio’s hand with all her strength. </span></p><p><span>Rio lost all feeling in her fingers but didn’t say a word as Agatha gripped her tightly and the game went into extra innings. It was still all tied up. </span></p><p><span>In the tenth inning, Henderson of the Sox hit a homer that caused both Agatha and Rio to zoom around the room like chickens with their heads cut off. The team put one more run up on the board. Boston was leading 5-3. </span></p><p><span>“Am I dreaming? Am I dead?” Agatha was huffing and puffing from all the running. </span></p><p><span>“I’ll get you some water, mi amor.” Rio ran to the kitchen. </span></p><p><span>In the bottom of the tenth, the Red Sox got two quick and easy outs. They were one out away from winning it all. It seemed inevitable. The graphic even flashed onto the screen “Congratulations Boston Red Sox, 1986 World Champions" on accident. </span></p><p><span>Agatha watched the sure thing dissolve as the Mets rallied and tied up the game thanks to several hits, then a wild pitch by the substitute closing pitcher. The Mets now only needed one run to win and end it. </span></p><p><span>They were gifted the win when an easy ground ball went to first baseman, Bill Buckner, and rolled right through his legs. It would have been comical if it wasn’t so devastating. </span></p><p><span>“NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!” Agatha fell to her knees in front of the couch. “NOOOOOOOO!!!” </span></p><p><span>She grabbed the pillow behind her and screamed “FUCK” so loud until her voice gave out. </span></p><p><span>The Mets scored. They won. The series was going to a game seven. Boston had fumbled it. </span></p><p><span>The final game of the series was played in New York as well. Boston went up early as usual. Hopes were high. Peggy and her family were over at the house to watch the game with Agatha and Rio. </span></p><p><span>Eleven year old Stevie sat right next to Agatha the whole time, glued to the screen just like her role model. Both of them dug into the bowl of chips and salsa. </span></p><p><span>“Agatha, are they going to win this time?” She asked. </span></p><p><span>“They’re up by three runs. We gotta really wish hard, okay? They need all the good magic we can send them.” </span></p><p><span>Agatha watched the young girl close her eyes and scrunch her face in concentration. </span></p><p><span>Things looked good up until the sixth inning, when the Mets rallied and tied it up. They put five more runs on the board, and the Red Sox were World Series losers once more. All the wishing and praying was no help. </span></p><p><span>The team really did seem cursed. </span></p><p><span>“Fuck baseball.” Agatha held her head in her hands. </span></p><p><span>Rio rubbed circles on her back, “You don’t mean that.”</span></p><p><span>“I sure as hell mean it right now.”</span></p><p><span>“You’ll forget next year.”</span></p><p><span>“Maybe.” Agatha gave her signature smirk. Baseball drove her crazy, but she would never give up hope on her team. She relished the calming hands running along her spine in relaxing, well-worn patterns. </span></p><p><span>She was blessed and cursed to love her four things. The Red Sox, baseball, Nicky, and finally the one that got away and then came back, her wife, her friend, her constant supporter, Rio Vidal. </span></p>

<blockquote><p>If we never do anymore, we have gotten our display there for all America to see. Every man, woman, boy and especially the girls that travel through their hallowed halls will now see the All American Girls Professional Baseball League. They will see action shots, individuals, lots of league memorabilia and above all they will see the names, hometowns, and years played by our players. For this we should all be very, very proud.</p><p>June Peppas</p></blockquote><p> </p><p><em>November 5, 1988. Cooperstown, New York</em></p><p>Hundreds of women, along with their friends and families, descended on the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown on a brisk, early winter’s day. After years of lobbying and pushing, the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League was finally being recognized in its rightful place alongside the rest of baseball history. </p><p>“If my photo isn’t front and center, I’m setting fire to this place.” Agatha remarked to Rio as they pulled into the parking lot. </p><p>“Don’t even joke about that.” Rio put the car in park and ran around to help her wife out. Agatha had knee surgery a few years back and was still a bit wobbly at times. All those years of catching had taken their toll. Rio opened the back seat to grab Agatha’s cane. </p><p>“Well, aren’t you two a sight for sore eyes.”</p><p>“Greta!” Rio accepted a hug from the tall woman, whose curled grey locks were styled like an old Hollywood starlet. </p><p>“Trouble walking there, butterfingers?” Greta pointed at the cane Agatha now yielded. </p><p>“I can swing this sucker like a bat - watch yourself.” Agatha lifted the wooden walking stick up and pointed it at their old friend. </p><p>“Where’s Carson?” Rio asked. </p><p>“There!” Greta pointed behind her at her partner pushing a stroller up the sidewalk. “Our youngest had his first baby earlier in the year.”</p><p>Carson greeted them and introduced baby Jessica to everyone. Their son, Calvin, came up carrying the diaper bag. </p><p>“Where’s your British friend? Aren’t you two always attached at the hip?” Greta asked. </p><p>“Speak of the devil…” Agatha saw Peggy and Steve in their big SUV pull up with their growing family. </p><p>Steve held the door open for Peggy as she stretched from the long drive. She immediately saw her group of friends and walked over, “Are they serving snacks at this thing or what? I’m famished.”</p><p>“Everyone’s lining up over there.” Rio pointed towards the entrance where all the women were gathering. </p><p>They walked together towards the entrance and admired the large banners along the wall announcing the new exhibit. There was a team photo of the Rockford Peaches on one of them. </p><p>“Look, darling. It’s us!” Greta grabbed Carson and beamed as they found themselves in the photo and showed their son, who snapped a picture on his disposable camera.</p><p>“Is that an Angel I see?”</p><p>Agatha spun around and saw a vaguely familiar face. It took a second before she realized, “Buckets?”</p><p>The woman nodded quickly and hugged her, “Nobody calls me that since I got married. My new last name is Spencer - boring! Anyway, all the Comets are gathering over here, come on.”</p><p>She led them over towards the front doors where Agatha and Rio reunited with so many of their old teammates. They had maintained fairly regular contact with the ones who attended their wedding, and they saw most of the others at the annual reunions. But there were some they hadn’t seen in decades like Buckets, Helen, Shirley, and Babe. </p><p>A man came up to Agatha cautiously. He looked to be in his early 40s, glasses, a neat short haircut. There was something in the eyes that reminded her of someone. “Agatha? Agatha Harkness?” He asked. </p><p>“Who’s asking?”</p><p>“I’m Sam Grant.” He held out his hand, which she shook. </p><p>“Grant…No. Are you…Coach Grant’s son? I didn’t know he had a kid.”</p><p>“Yeah, the old man had me after he left coaching. But he talked about it constantly. Always said it was the best job he ever had.”</p><p>“Where is Doc?” </p><p>Sam’s face fell, “Lost him a few years ago. Smoking a pack a day finally caught up with him.”</p><p>“I’m sorry. He was a great coach.”</p><p>“Yeah, he coached me all the way through high school. Always used to compare me to the best catcher he knew. I’m glad I can finally meet that catcher in person.”</p><p>Agatha smiled and shook her head, feeling shy, “You were a catcher?” </p><p>“Yup - I’ll probably be needing one of those in a few years.” He gestured to her cane. “Wait, is that Rio?”</p><p>“You know her too?”</p><p>“He talked about all of you. I’ve only seen a few pictures, but they are all pretty faded. He would go on and on about Rio though - saying that he would have drafted her to the big leagues if he had the chance.”</p><p>Agatha called her wife over, “Here she is.”</p><p>“I always wondered if I’d ever get a chance to meet any of you. It’s like meeting a superhero from a comic.”</p><p>“Rio Vidal - nice to meet you.” </p><p>“Wow, pleasure’s all mine. Do you still pitch at all?”</p><p>“Just for our slow pitch league. I don’t think my elbow could handle a fastball anymore.” Rio exaggeratedly stretched her throwing arm. </p><p>There was a flurry of activity as the crowd seemed to converge on the entrance. Sam was several heads taller than the group and could see the main doors, “Looks like they are letting us in.”</p><p>Agatha reached out and grabbed Rio’s hand. Like everything else, they were going to do this together.</p><p>The Baseball Hall of Fame was established in 1939. Its motto is “Preserving History, Honoring Excellence, Connecting Generations,” and it serves as the central collection of baseball history in the United States. </p><p>The energy was palpable as the women in the room gathered next to the exhibit on the ground floor. There was a red ribbon roping it off. For years, women’s professional baseball was a forgotten moment in time. Nobody talked about it or even acknowledged it had happened. But for hundreds of young women from across the continent, it changed and shaped their entire lives. They were finally getting their long overdue recognition. </p><p>The daughter of Mr. Wrigley, one of the founders and main proponents of the league, stood in front of the group. She dedicated the exhibit to all the players, staff, and fans who kept the league going through those tough years. </p><p>As the ribbon fell, the old ballplayers flooded the space and re-lived their shared history in this space that previously only welcomed men’s accomplishments. </p><p>Dead center, right next to the introduction sign, was Agatha. Well, a 30 year old version of the woman anyway. It was a larger than life size version of the picture that was featured in LIFE magazine - the one that Rio used to put up in her locker. </p><p>“Ha! Check me out!” Agatha used her cane to recreate the batting pose. Rio felt her heart tighten and suddenly was overcome with emotion at the sight of her past and her present converging in front of her eyes. </p><p>Peggy had joined them and had Sandy take a photo, “A little to the left Agatha. Raise your elbows. There.”</p><p>Rio quietly wiped her eyes. She remembered every inch of that photo of her love. It had been her light in the dark. It had encouraged her to change her life and circumstances. She had loved the batter before she even met her. That photo had been the key to unlock the chains around her heart that she’d fastened after losing Agatha the first time. Her copy was currently framed in their bedroom and sat on her bedside table. </p><p>Now, thousands of strangers would get to witness her most prized possession and revel in its glory. </p><p>“Are you tearing up on me already?” Agatha raised her hand to cup Rio’s face and wiped away a stray tear with her thumb. </p><p>“No! No, I’m fine. Just seeing you like that again…”</p><p>“I was hot, right?” </p><p>“You still are.” Rio was forever smitten.</p><p>Peggy waved them over to another glass case that had a picture of Rio pitching next to some displayed gloves, “It’s a shot from your perfect game.” </p><p>Rio smiled widely at the picture of her on the mound. She was completely focussed, mid wind up, her leg stretched high. </p><p>“God, you used to be flexible.” Agatha muttered lowly. Rio could hear the suggestive husk in her tone.</p><p>“I can still touch my toes!” Rio countered. She had kept up her exercises and tried to stretch every morning after waking up. </p><p>They walked through the exhibits and checked out all the old memorabilia, uniforms, photos, and long forgotten tokens of the past. It was an impressive collection of the league - all thoughtfully presented and explained for visitors. </p><p>“Whoa!” Agatha stumbled for a second as a toddler zoomed past her and almost knocked her off balance. She took in the shock of bright orange hair on the little tike. </p><p>“Viv! Get back here!” A curly headed man chased after the kid.</p><p>“William?” Agatha asked. She hadn’t seen him in a decade or so since he’d moved across the country to California. </p><p>“Oh! Hey Agatha!” He strained his neck and could see Viv running into her dad, Tommy’s arms - safe for now. </p><p>“Are you on babysitting duty?”</p><p>William looked sheepish, “I was. She’s got my brother’s speed, that's for sure. Kid’s going to be a track star or something.”</p><p>“It’s one of life’s many mysteries - how can toddlers run so fast when their legs are so dang short?” Agatha remembered chasing Nicky all over the park near their house. “Where’s the other ginger?” She looked around for Wanda. </p><p>“She’s down with the flu. Awful timing - I swear she was going to start a fight when the doctor told her she couldn’t travel. I think I saw her eyes glow red! She insisted that Tommy and I come anyway.”</p><p>“Look at that - she really has always been a fighter.” Agatha noticed a large photo of Wanda laying back on a bed as Lilia tended to a nasty slide wound on her thigh. Her leg looked like it had been grated - all the skin had peeled off in the dirt. </p><p>“God damn, why did they make you play in skirts again?” William winced looking at the painful injury. </p><p>Agatha explained it simply, “Misogyny, my sweet summer child.” </p><p>After taking in all they could, the group retreated outside and expectedly ended up on the practice fields behind the museum. There was a ton of equipment ready and waiting. There were so many players they split up onto the various fields to play some pick up games. </p><p>“Schoolyard pick!” Greta cupped her hands and yelled. She was as boisterous and commanding as ever. Despite the fact that they were all well into their later years. “Losers buy the first round at the bar!”</p><p>The ladies lined up along the foul line as the families took to the bleachers. Greta was one captain while Agatha was chosen as the other. They were both well-known in the league and loved to command attention. They used a bat to pick who would go first, stacking their hands until the last person won. Agatha got dibs. </p><p>“Wonder who you’re going to pick…” Greta said as they stood next to each other. </p><p>“Rio.” Agatha pointed to her wife. She would always be her number one choice. </p><p>“Carson.” Greta fired back. Another obvious decision. </p><p>“Peggy.” </p><p>“Jo.”</p><p>“Jess.”</p><p>“Horsey.”</p><p>Back and forth it went with each captain choosing their favorite players for each position. They added a few extra outfielders per team to cover all the ground. Agatha’s team was batting first. </p><p>Dottie was the lead off hitter. </p><p>“We want a pitcher, not a belly itcher!” Agatha chanted from the dugout. Forever a menace. Nickels was pitching and shook her head at the heckling. </p><p>Dottie grounded the first pitch to Mary at second, who easily scooped it up and tossed it to Greta at first for an out. </p><p>Agatha was up next. She strutted out to the box. </p><p>“Don’t choke, Angel!” Carson bantered from behind the plate. </p><p>“You wish.”</p><p>She waited until she saw a low ball outside. She pivoted and let loose on it, sending it flying to a gap in left field. Her knees didn’t have it in her to sprint like she used to, but she made it easily to first for a single. </p><p>“Lucky swing.” Greta pestered her at first as she watched Rio come up to bat next. </p><p>“That wasn’t luck, doll. I was born with this talent.” Agatha boasted. </p><p>Rio was ready and waiting at the plate. Agatha could see the intensity in her eyes. When she connected with the ball, she ran hard for second. She could hear her team urging her on to third base, but her knees were already screaming. Rio was coming up behind her. </p><p>“Run, mi amor. Run faster!” Rio yelled on her heels. </p><p>Agatha turned her neck to look back, “This is my top speed!”</p><p>The ball was still rolling in the outfield as it had bounced off the wall. Agatha managed to get to third by some miracle, and Rio was safe at second after a close throw. </p><p>“Do you need a defibrillator?” Jo DeLuca joked at third base as Agatha huffed with her hands on her knees. </p><p>“Shut up, Joey. Watch the game.” </p><p>Agatha scored on a sacrifice fly ball, but Greta’s team were able to hold them at one run. </p><p>Rio grabbed a glove and walked with Agatha out onto the field. She was in just a chest protector and mask. She couldn’t crouch low anymore but could catch slow pitch easily.</p><p>“Just like the old days - it’s like no time has passed.” Rio remarked as they made the familiar walk across the dirt. </p><p>“I feel a million years old, Rio. You’re going to need to wheel me home after this.” Agatha waved to young Stevie, who was freshly 13 and angsty but lit up when in a ballpark. She was enraptured watching the former pros play again. </p><p>Greta was up first, “Come on, Reaper. Give me something I can hit!”</p><p>“Be careful what you wish for.” Agatha opened her mitt and watched Rio abandon her plan to take it easy. She saw Rio wind-up and fire a fastball. It didn’t have the burning heat from her youth, but it was still speedy. It hit Agatha’s glove with a smack for a strike. </p><p>“Oof.” Greta knocked the bat against her shoes and reset. </p><p>Rio slowed it down and threw an easy one down the middle, which Greta sent soaring right into Bucket's glove. </p><p>“Nice try, Greta. Guess we can’t all keep our skills into old age.” Agatha snarked as she watched her old friend stomp back to the dugout. </p><p>The game was casual and fun as they traded sides and insults throughout. Rio loved watching Agatha come alive again when trashtalking and pushing herself to the limit. Somehow they had discovered the ability to time travel. All they needed was four bases, a bat, and a ball. Who needs quantum theory or a Delorean? </p><p>Rio watched Agatha screaming with joy as Peggy scored and felt like she was 26 years old and falling in love all over again. It didn’t matter how many games they played or how often, each time she played ball with Agatha she was transported again. </p><p>Agatha’s team won by six runs to two. Rio’s pitching was somehow still as dangerous as it was forty years ago. </p><p>“Good game.” Agatha shook Greta’s hand. </p><p>“We’ll get you next time.” </p><p>“Yeah sure, and the Red Sox will win the World Series one day.” Agatha joked. It was a common phrase these days after the devastating loss in ‘86. It was as unlikely as pigs flying. </p><p>Rio was tired and her arm was aching, but she felt so content. Agatha was glowing in the way she always did after a competition. Her face was flushed, her long white hair was wild and crazy, her beautiful laugh lines were on full display. </p><p>In Rio’s eyes, there was no better sight in the world. </p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p><b>October 2004</b> </p><p><em>Busch Memorial Stadium - St Louis, Missouri</em></p><p>The 100th World Series was like déjà vu for Rio. The Boston Red Sox were up against the St. Louis Cardinals again - just like they were in 1968. It was also the anniversary of the Red Sox loss against the Mets in ‘86. All the memories were blending together. </p><p>“Abuela Rio, who’s that?” The little girl sitting next to her in the stands pointed to the man walking out to the mound. </p><p>“Ah, that’s the pitcher. The most important player in the game.” Rio explained. “He controls the game. Everything starts and stops with the pitcher.”</p><p>“Margaret, did you know Abuela Rio was once a pitcher too?” Stevie asked her four year old daughter.</p><p>“Really?” The little girl looked at Rio, who was now riding in a wheelchair, and couldn’t seem to believe it. How could this old woman have once stood tall on the pitcher’s mound?</p><p>“Yes, mija. I once played with your Great-Grandma Peggy. Do you remember her?”</p><p>“Yup! Oooooh, who’s that in the red armor? Like a knight!” She pointed at the player who was walking out behind home plate. Her young mind glommed onto all the stimulation like a bee to a flower. </p><p>“That’s the catcher. I used to know the best catcher in the world.” Rio’s eyes shined as she rubbed the worn baseball card she held tight in her jacket pocket. </p><p>“My mommy?” Margaret looked to her mom. Stevie laughed and kissed her daughter on the head. It was true that Stevie did play catcher when she was younger - as if she would play any other position when she worshipped Agatha so. </p><p>“Not your mommy. My wife was the number one catcher back in the day.” She pulled out the baseball card and showed Margaret the picture of Agatha posing in her catcher’s gear. The league had reprinted all the player cards not long after the blockbuster film, “A League of their Own” was released in 1992. </p><p>Rio had bought up several copies of the Agatha “Angel” Harkness cards. </p><p>“She’s so pretty. How come she’s not here?” The girl asked. </p><p>Rio’s heart sank, and she couldn’t find her voice. Thankfully, she heard Stevie cut in, “Agatha lived a long, long life. She was very tired, and her body wanted to rest.”</p><p>“Like Ruffles?” Margaret’s cat had recently died suddenly. </p><p>“Yes, sweetheart. Oh, do you hear that?” Stevie heard the announcer asking the crowd to please rise for the national anthem. Saved by the bell. Rio, for once, was grateful for the old tradition. </p><p>It was game four. The Red Sox had won the first three games. But the fans had endured enough suffering to know that nothing was guaranteed. Baseball could take just as much as it could give. Rio had been there to see every disappointment, had heard every scream of defeat from her wife’s mouth, had watched Boston lose and lose and lose.</p><p>“Play ball!” Game four was underway. One more win. They could do it tonight. They could end the Curse of the Bambino once and for all. Legend had it that the Red Sox were cursed ever since the owners sold the greatest player of all time, Babe Ruth, to the Yankees in 1920. From that moment on the team was cursed, seemingly destined to lose, to pay for that original sin over and over again. </p><p>An old curse, passed down for generations, is incredibly hard to break. But tonight, just maybe, they could do it. </p><p>“Abuela, what’s happening now?” This was Margaret’s first major league game. She was a little young, but Stevie was a rabid fan thanks to Agatha’s indoctrination. There was no chance she was going to let her daughter miss potential history. They had paid an obscene amount of money for the tickets, the airfare, and the hotel, but they weren’t ever going to miss this. </p><p>Rio explained the goings on of the game to the young girl, whose eyes were as big as saucers, trying to take it all in. There was so much to see, and the crowd was unlike any other that Rio had ever experienced. The anticipation was like a pot over fire - building and building with energy as the rolling boil threatened to overtake the water. </p><p>“I can’t believe she’s not here.” Stevie commented as the first inning began. The Red Sox were batting first. </p><p>“I know.” Rio felt the loss in the marrow of her bones. A piece of her disappeared when Agatha did.</p><p>But, she also felt Agatha’s presence everywhere around her. In a ballpark, it was like her wife’s atoms flowed through everything. The anticipation in the crowd was like the tension that always sparked between them. The fervor of the fans was a reflection of Agatha’s own relentless devotion to this team. The look in children’s eyes when they fell in love with the game for the first time recalled Agatha’s dedication to her students and players.</p><p>It was all there. </p><p>Everywhere Rio looked she deeply felt connected to Agatha’s very soul. She looked to the sky. </p><p>“Look at the moon, Margaret.” Rio pointed up. </p><p>“Wooooooowwww!” </p><p>The moon looked a dusky red - a blood moon, when the veil between the living and the dead is at its thinnest. This was the first lunar eclipse to ever take place during a World Series game. </p><p>Agatha really did feel as close as ever. </p><p>Baseball and their relationship was one. There was no disentangling the complicated weaving of the two. Her love for Agatha was wrapped up in strikes and fouls and slides into home base. As long as baseball continued on, so would her love for her wife. </p><p>“I love you Johnny Damon!” A woman screamed behind them. Margaret almost spit out her juice as another Boston fan cheered on the batter. His signature long locks were the envy of many, and he sent the ball soaring into the stands in his first at-bat in the first inning to give the Red Sox the lead.</p><p>Stevie gripped Rio’s hand, just like Agatha used to. </p><p>The Sox scored two more in the third inning. It was 3-0. </p><p>“Rio, is it happening? Is this really happening?” Stevie looked over at her surrogate grandmother. Rio and Agatha used to babysit Stevie whenever her mother Sandy was at work and Peggy was too busy. Although Stevie was obsessed with Agatha, she loved Rio just as much. Since Peggy’s passing three years ago, Rio was the last one standing. </p><p>“It looks good, kid.” Rio couldn’t let herself get too optimistic yet, but the hum of the crowd was building.</p><p>The Red Sox starting pitcher, Derek Lowe, pitched seven scoreless innings. It was brilliant. The Cardinals had no answer for his pitches and couldn’t put together any sort of offense. </p><p>“Abuela, why is everyone standing?” Margaret looked around at the top of the ninth inning as the entire stadium seemed to stand. </p><p>“They are sending all their good feelings to their team. They are showing support. Just three more outs, and we win.” Rio explained. </p><p>“Can you stand with me?” The girl asked. </p><p>“Oh, Margaret, Rio might not....” Stevie tried to say, but Rio shook her head and braced herself against her chair arms. She was 82 years old and still in mostly good health, but the long walk to the stadium from the parking lot was a touch too far these days. Her knees would protest tomorrow, but when a kid asks you to stand and watch with them, you stand and watch with them. </p><p>Rio held onto the seat back in front of her for extra support, and Stevie helped Margaret stand on the chair to see. The little girl held tightly to Rio’s arm and watched the final inning of the World Series. </p><p>“The pitcher is changing!” Margaret announced as she saw the man on the mound swap out with a new person. </p><p>Red Sox closer Keith Foulke came in to pitch the last inning. The first batter hit a single, which quieted the crowd. Then, the next batter popped out. The third struck out. </p><p>Two outs. </p><p>“They’re going to do it.” Stevie was almost shaking with excitement. Margaret was jumping in her chair. Rio was in disbelief. The noise was thunderous. </p><p>The fourth Cardinals batter came up to the plate. He knocked a ground ball straight back to the mound. The pitcher fielded it easily and tossed it underhand to first base.</p><p>It was like an explosion. </p><p>The crowd went insane as the final out was called. There were only a couple thousand Boston fans in this St. Louis stadium but you’d never know it from the noise. </p><p>“Red Sox fans have longed to hear it. For the first time in 86 years, the Boston Red Sox are World Series champions!”</p><p>Rio took out the card in her pocket and stared into Agatha’s brilliant blue eyes that seemed to sparkle even in print. Everyone was going crazy, the players were dogpiling each other on the field. Stevie was crying and holding Margaret in a tight hug, it was impossible to hear anything.  </p><p>Rio felt a chill up her spine, goosebumps rippled across her arms and legs. She smiled wide despite the tears balancing on the edge of her eyes. </p><p>She could feel Agatha’s spirit so close - like they were one. </p><p>Rio looked down at the card and spoke softly, “Congratulations, my love. </p><p>I know you’ve been waiting for this day. You can rest easy now. </p><p>Game over.”</p>
