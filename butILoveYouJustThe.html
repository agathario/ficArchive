<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Instinctively, Agatha grabs the nearest item to her, a pencil, and throws it violently at Rio’s head.<br/>The others in the room all burst into exclamations, but Rio doesn’t flinch, just lets the pencil fly right past her.

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>“That’s it Agatha! I can’t take it anymore, you’re impossible!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ralph please–,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No! I’ve put up for this for far too long, I cannot be in the same room as that…dream killer!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Ralph Bohner stands aggressively from his drum set, almost knocking over everything around him. He doesn’t seem to pay much mind to them. Ralph raises his index finger, shaking it in Agatha’s direction. She heaves out a sigh, </span>
<em>
<span>god he could be dramatic</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Dream killer? Really Ralph? You can barely keep time without bursting a blood vessel,” Agatha responds, raising an eyebrow and letting her microphone fall to her side. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Billy warns, ever the peacekeeper. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This is </span>
<em>
<span>exactly</span>
</em>
<span> what I mean! You don’t respect me or my art, she doesn’t respect </span>
<em>
<span>any of us!</span>
</em>
<span>” Ralph continues, spinning around, arms wide to look at the other band members. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Alice tilts her head down, avoiding his eyes, Jen just shrugs, while Billy just looks stressed out to the max. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It doesn’t take much for Ralph to realise he is the only one who really cares right now, and he scoffs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m out! I’m out here trying to bring passion to this godforsaken band and all I get is snarky comments and no respect,” Ralph throws his drumsticks onto the ground theatrically, and Agatha has to try her best not to laugh, though her eyes shine with enjoyment. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck you Agatha,” Ralph stage-whispers, spitting the words like venom in her direction. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gives him a pout and a patronising wave, “good luck Ralph, I’m sure there’ll be someone out there interested in having a drummer who can’t keep a simple beat,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>This time Ralph does physically spit on the ground, his face flush with anger. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know what! Fuck all of you! You’re all a bunch of losers who have let this asshole </span>
<em>
<span>rot</span>
</em>
<span> your minds,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay Ralph we get it,” Jen cuts in, “She’s an evil conniving bitch… but she makes good music,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Ralph stutters and splutters, before groaning and stomping his way out of the rehearsal space. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You forgot your sticks!” Agatha calls out, her tone filled with mock. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck you Agatha!” Ralph repeats, and then a door slams closed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The four remaining band members stand in silence, the other three sharing looks between one another. Agatha claps her hands, smiling brightly, “well, shall we continue?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Jen just stares at Agatha, “you’re kidding me,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turns to her, “oh come </span>
<em>
<span>on</span>
</em>
<span>, we don’t need him to keep playing. We are the </span>
<em>
<span>Coven of Chaos</span>
</em>
<span> for crying out loud! Chaos is in the name! Besides, it’s not my fault he can’t take some constructive criticism,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen laughs, “constructive?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes </span>
<em>
<span>constructive</span>
</em>
<span>, Jennifer,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen just rolls her eyes, before looking over at Alice. Alice takes the hint, standing up from her piano stool. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, look, we just need to think about this properly. Why don’t we just take a breath,” she starts, and Billy nods in agreement, fidgeting with his guitar strap. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ve got our biggest show yet in three weeks, and now we don’t have a drummer, so instead of arguing or pretending that we’re going to be fine without one,” she pauses, giving a pointed look at Agatha, “how about we work out what we’re actually going to do about it,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s a silence, as they all look around, waiting for someone else to speak. However, the silence gets broken from the opening of a nearby door getting shoved open, banging against the wall behind it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha knew it would be coming eventually, so it’s not unexpected when the band’s manager, Lilia comes barging in through the door of their rehearsal space. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha!” She calls out. Agatha groans, rolling her eyes before turning to face her with a plastered on smile. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lilia, what a surprise,” she responds, tilting her head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ralph just called me,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Urgh he’s impossible,” Agatha mutters to herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia puts a hand on her hip. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can someone, besides Agatha, tell me what happened?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha goes to speak, but she is immediately met with Lilia’s finger in the air, silencing her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia’s gaze sweeps over the remaining band members, who just stare back at her awkwardly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy finally clears his throat, “Ralph had a bit of a meltdown and he uh quit,” he explains, almost expecting Agatha to cut in. He glances over at her, and she just shrugs nonchalantly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And this meltdown was caused by…?” Lilia questions, rubbing at her temple. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Take a guess,” Jen replies, crossing her arms. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raises an eyebrow, feigning innocence, but the satisfaction in her face is obvious. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who, me?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Look, as much as we all agree that Agatha certainly didn’t help with the matter… we all know Ralph wasn’t very…” Alice starts, but Agatha cuts her off.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Talented? Skilled? Handsome? Interesting?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Lilia warns. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh come on, Lilia. You know it, we all know it. If we’re going to make it big we’re going to need someone who can keep up,” Agatha argues, flicking her hair over her shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha expects Lilia to glare at her, but instead the woman just stares off into the distance for a moment. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And we’ve lost her again,” Agatha says, throwing her hands up in the air. It was pretty common for their manager to completely zone out for a few seconds at a time, the band had stopped bothering to question it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After a few seconds, Lilia shakes herself out of it, “you’ll find a new drummer, tomorrow,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha resists the urge to roll her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy puts up his hand, only dropping it when Alice calls out his name, as if he can’t speak without it, “maybe we could put up flyers, or something. Hold auditions here tomorrow,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can’t,” Agatha cuts in, not allowing anyone else the chance to speak first, “I’m busy,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia raises her eyebrow, “with what, exactly?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have a life, Lilia. People who I spend time with, the usual,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>At this, Jen scoffs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s so funny, Jennifer?” Agatha questions. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Enough!” Lilia exclaims, “everyone just, go home. Get those flyers ready, and come back here tomorrow at 4 for auditions. And you </span>
<em>
<span>will </span>
</em>
<span>be there Agatha,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opens her mouth to argue, but decides against it as all eyes turn to her. She holds her arms up in defeat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When the next day comes around, Agatha approaches the rehearsal room with a coffee in hand. She can’t be bothered to deal with all these wannabe professionals who think they are talented enough to perform with her band. She has spent years putting her all into her performances. She plays like a </span>
<em>
<span>witch</span>
</em>
<span>, and no matter how frustrating others find her, it’s undeniable that she is a fantastic singer and an even better </span>
<em>
<span>performer. </span>
</em>
<span>Sure, Coven of Chaos isn’t huge, but they are certainly on their way. Agatha had started the band with Billy, who was desperate to create something musically huge with her. It didn’t take them long til they found Lilia, who told them that to do well, they’d need more band mates than just the two of them, and she gave them the names of Alice and Jen. And unfortunately, Lilia always knew what would make the perfect band. Ralph was Billy’s pick, he was a friend of a friend and Billy had felt bad for him and convinced the others to let him join. And that’s how they became a real band. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Despite her attitude, Agatha didn’t mind working with the others. They were good at what they did, and kept up with her on the majority of occasions. Ralph, however, was just dead weight. Last night’s outburst was definitely expected, and Agatha was glad for it, even if it meant she had to come and listen to horrid drummers all day today. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha takes another sip of her coffee before throwing the cup into a nearby bin. She’s already late, because of course she is, and so as she approaches the rehearsal room, she can hear the steady try-hard beat of a drummer. She rolls her eyes to herself, before entering, completely ignoring the person auditioning and making her way to a nearby table. She isn’t quiet or careful about it, so immediately all attention in the room turns to her, and the drummer gets quickly distracted, ruining their rhythm. </span>
</p><p>
<span>For the first time, Agatha looks up at him. He’s a young guy, trying his best, but his mistake makes him flush red and mutter curses under his breath as his hands fall to his sides. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looks around the room, “sorry, did I interrupt?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Everyone in the room is staring at her, but it’s as if Alice can’t bear the second hand embarrassment as she turns to look at the ground. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re late,” Jen states, and Agatha just shrugs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy looks at his watch, before groaning and pulling out $5 and handing it over to Lilia. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s all that about?” Agatha questions, as Lilia sticks the money into her bag. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Lilia guessed the closest on how late you’d be,” Billy explains, “why do I keep trying to bet against her?” he mutters to himself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The guy on the drum clears his throat, and finally everyone turns back to him, realising he’s still there. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry kid, didn’t mean to ruin your </span>
<em>
<span>flow,</span>
</em>
<span>” Agatha says, but Alice is quick to cut in before she can say anything ridiculous. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How about you go from the top, now that Agatha is here?” Her voice is calm, and empathetic, but it doesn’t do much to calm the poor guy down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He stammers, flush deepening as he begins to drum out a basic beat, but the pressure of the room has clearly gotten to him. He’s shaky anyways, but he seems to be so focused on Agatha in his periphery that everytime she makes even the slightest of movements, he </span>
</p><p>
<span>flinches a bit, resulting in an uneven rhythm. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen and Alice share a look, while Lilia practically winces when he makes an unforgiving mistake. Agatha’s face remains neutral the entire time, but after a minute, she just holds up her hand and the man immediately stops. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think we’ve got enough from this audition,” she explains, putting on an overly large smile that is clearly just mock, “you’ll hear from us…or you won’t,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The guy practically bolts, scooping up his backpack as he scrambles out of the room, not even bothering to say another word. The door slams shut behind him, and the room is left in silence as all eyes turn to Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looks back at them, confused, “what? He was a mess!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, because </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> came in late and distracted him,” Alice argues. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can you at least try to not be a </span>
<em>
<span>diva</span>
</em>
<span>?” Billy asks, pleading almost, “we need a drummer, Agatha. We are a band, it’s Coven of Chaos, not Agatha and the Coven of Chaos,”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tilts her head, making a humming noise, “hm that does have a nice ring to it though,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha!” Billy exclaims. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, okay, I’ll be pleasant,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The others don’t seem convinced, but before Agatha knows it, the next drummer gets called in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Next up, is a girl with spiky dyed green hair that drums so hard that his drumstick splinters, and Agatha swears she’s going to break the entire drum kit before her two and a half minute song is over. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After her, is a middle aged guy, who drums well enough at first, but his song continues for an overly long period of time, with Lilia checking her watch about 5 times before she finally thanks him for his time mid-song. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>More people come and go, none of them of any genuine skill or talent. Agatha gets more and more bored as people come in and out, meaning she tries to have more personal fun, but that usually results in more fear from the performers and failing miserably, but hey, at least Agatha has fun. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>By the time their list of names runs out, the entire room is exhausted and frustrated. Agatha stretches, yawning dramatically, completely unconcerned for the others' visible frustration. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So that’s all of them? What are we, magnets for complete losers?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe it’s ‘cause we only hung the flyers last night, they didn’t get around to a lot of people,” Billy suggests, and Alice nods along. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah maybe if we get the word out we can-,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do this all again?” Jen cuts in, and immediately Alice and Billy deflate. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The room falls into silence, except for Agatha’s foot tapping steadily on the ground. She initially does it on instinct and boredom, but she continues when she notices the way Jen clearly is starting to get overly frustrated by the noise. However, before Jen gets the chance to lash out, Lilia breaks the vocal silence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ll find her,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Everyone looks at one another in confusion. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Her?” Alice questions, but before Lilia gets the chance to answer, the door to the rehearsal space creaks open. Everyone, besides Agatha, turns to look at the door. Agatha remains nonchalant, she hates the idea that others think she is immediately interested in them. Instead, she looks at her nails, trying to decide on if she should get purple polish next time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I heard you guys were having a party?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The familiarity of the voice makes Agatha physically freeze. Instinctively, she swivels toward the door, mouth agape in absolute shock. There, in the doorway is Rio Vidal. Rio and Agatha had gone to high school together. They only became…known to each other, in their senior year, but they had that much of an influence on one another that they both decided to go to the same college. They then both promptly dropped out only a semester in to follow their passion for music as a duo. But that was before it all fell into flames. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes immediately lock with Agatha’s, as a sly smile begins to make its way across Rio’s face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Seeing the immediate mischief in the woman’s eyes is the thing that pulls Agatha out of her shocked trance. Instinctively, she grabs the nearest item to her, a pencil, and throws it violently at Rio’s head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The others in the room all burst into exclamations, but Rio doesn’t flinch, just lets the pencil fly right past her. Agatha pretty much forgets about everyone else in the room, her eyes only on Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t miss a beat, her smile and eyes widening. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nice to see you too, Agatha,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Just hearing her voice again makes Agatha feel like screaming. Instead, she grabs another two pencils and flings them at Rio’s figure. This time Rio has to move her head out of the way to dodge the flying objects. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raises an eyebrow, as Billy quickly rushes over and collects all of the throwable items in Agatha’s vicinity, pocketing them.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Um, can someone please tell me what is going on?” Jen asks, and without missing a beat, Rio responds, never taking her eyes away from Agatha’s. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m here to audition as a drummer. You guys need a drummer, right? I’m Rio,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes-,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No-,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and Alice speak at the same time. Finally, Agatha tears her eyes from Rio to give Alice a stern glare. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The position has been filled, we don’t need anyone anymore,” Agatha states, hastily getting the words out before anyone can cut her off. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio just looks at her, before letting out a huff of laughter and glancing at the ground. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s lying,” Billy replies, “you can set yourself up over there,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t move for a moment, poking the inside of her tongue with her cheek, before finally moving over to the drum kit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffs, averting her eyes from the familiar sight of Rio preparing herself to perform. The others all exchange glances, and Agatha notices the way a piece of paper slides between Alice and Jen, probably asking questions and discussing the newfound tension in the room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Show us what you’ve got,” Billy says, ignoring the piercing gaze Agatha sends in his direction. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirks to herself, full of confidence as she launches into a beat. Agatha crosses her arms, forcing herself to look anywhere in the room besides at Rio. Anywhere besides seeing the woman she had known for so long in her second favourite environment. Agatha doesn’t let her mind wander to her actual favourite. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio is, of course, perfect. Her hands move with practised ease, and it's undeniable that she has immense talent. The entire band watches on, their faces lit up with the idea of </span>
<em>
<span>finally</span>
</em>
<span>. As Rio finishes, she looks around the room at each member, her gaze lasting a second longer on Agatha, before returning to look at the others. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Woah, that was…” Alice starts. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Incredible,” Lilia concludes.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’d be stupid not to take her,” Jen whispers, and all of the others nod along. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha finally returns her gaze to Rio’s face, looking far too smug as always. Agatha crosses her arms tighter, shaking her head and trying her best to act unimpressed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No. It’s not happening,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen turns to her, clear annoyance already in her features, “oh come on, Agatha. Stop being ridiculous,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grits her teeth, purposefully ignoring Rio’s taunting innocent face in the corner of her eye. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I said no. Her sound won’t work with ours,” she lies. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio begins tapping her drumsticks together thoughtlessly, her eyes getting the familiar excited glimmer in them whenever there is ever any conflict around her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Trouble in paradise?” she questions, and Agatha </span>
<em>
<span>seethes</span>
</em>
<span>.     </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We should vote,” Alice suggests, “then we’ll get a majority vote,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wants to do something drastic; throw something, scream, burn the entire building down if that’s what it meant for them not to vote, but she already knows it’s no use. Frustrated, she blows air out of her mouth, before standing up abruptly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I need some fresh air, do whatever it is you want,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stands outside on the curb, lighting a cigarette. However her peaceful silence is broken by the sound of the door she had just exited from, opening and slamming closed. She groans, not bothering to turn around. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Billy, now is not the time for a pep talk or your questions,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hears a whistle, far too familiar, and she can’t help but roll her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re out here getting pep talks from a 12 year old?” Rio asks, and Agatha just puts the cigarette back in her mouth, using it as a way to remain silent for a few seconds longer. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s nineteen, and he is a good guitarist,” she states, matter of factly.</span>
</p><p>
<span> She would never say that around Billy, but she does feel a sense of pride when he performs well. Her mother had never appreciated Agatha’s love for music, and Agatha wanted to make sure that Billy knew someone believed he was doing a good job.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“So defensive,” Rio teases, finally making her way into Agatha’s line of sight. She gestures at the cigarette, “you know that thing is killing you, right?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good, maybe then I won’t have to see your face showing up uninvited ever again,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh come on baby, you know that I’ll be with you even in death,” Rio responds, before reaching over and plucking the cigarette from Agatha’s lips. Agatha goes to grab it back, but Rio is too quick, already pressing it against her own lips. Agatha turns, watching her and impatiently waiting for her cigarette back. Rio stares back. She raises an eyebrow before taking the cigarette out of her mouth. Agatha expects her to hand it back pretty quickly, and she does, but not before she blows smoke straight into Agatha’s face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha holds back a cough, and withholds her urge to fan the smoke away, instead just continuously staring back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What are you really doing here, Rio?” she finally asks, expecting Rio’s smirk to reappear. It doesn’t.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m here to join a band, Agatha, what else does it look like?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You could join any band you wanted to, why are you trying to audition for </span>
<em>
<span>mine</span>
</em>
<span>?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smirk finally reappears, “I could join </span>
<em>
<span>any</span>
</em>
<span>, could I? Do you think I’m that talented?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffs, “no, I just think you're that manipulative,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Ironic, coming from you,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha flicks her cigarette onto the ground, crushing it with the toes of her shoe. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just tell me straight,” she starts, but Rio cuts her off immediately. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pretty hard for either of us to do,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re genuinely insufferable. Why do I even try?” Agatha mutters to herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, hey, okay fine, what do you want to know?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighs, pinching the bridge of her nose. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you here for real reasons,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pauses, genuinely thinking. When she speaks next, her voice is the more genuine side of her that people saw only on occasion. Agatha doesn’t let herself think about how she’s heard it probably more than anyone else. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, Agatha. I’m here as myself, not as your ex,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nods to herself, breathing deeply through her nose. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, without saying another word, she turns around, coat flapping dramatically as she heads back into the rehearsal space. She hears Rio mutter an </span>
<em>
<span>okay then</span>
</em>
<span>, before following after her. As the two of them enter, all eyes in the room shift to them, as if awaiting a judicial decision. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stares back at them, before shrugging. They all know Agatha isn’t going to say it out loud, so they take that as the answer they need. Billy immediately breaks out into a smile, turning to look at Rio behind Agatha’s figure. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Congrats, Rio! Welcome to the band!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The others all smile, as if all of a sudden all the energy they lost throughout the afternoon has been inserted back into them. Rio walks over and makes awkward conversation with the others, while Agatha stands back, trying to act as if she is rearranging the pencils she threw at the drummer before. She keeps noticing how Rio’s gaze can’t last more than 30 seconds before falling back on Agatha, but Agatha pointedly ignores it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well this is excellent news. Your first rehearsal will be here tomorrow, I believe some great things will happen with you lot,” Lilia says and everyone seems to nod in agreement. As they all begin to pack their things away and start heading out, Agatha is the last one in the room. She looks up and sees Billy waiting by the door for her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you alright with this, Agatha?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha forces a laugh, “of course I’m alright, Billy. No need to be dramatic. We’re all professionals, aren’t we?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy seems to consider this for a few moments, before nodding slowly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, you know that if it ever came down to it, we’ll always choose you. None of this could have happened without you,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gives him a half hearted smile. She can’t really offer more than that, despite how much the words do genuinely mean to her. They both know what the smile means deep down. Billy nods, before readjusting the guitar strap on his shoulder and walking out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha takes her time, walking down the street to her car. The entire afternoon has been a crazy ride of bad performances to suddenly being in a band with her ex. She feels exhausted, and undeniably but secretly anxious for what their first rehearsal will hold. She just wants everything to go okay, she can’t have Rio mess this up for her, not again. When she reaches her car, she flings her bag into the trunk, before noticing a piece of paper stuck under her front wipers. She groans, ready for it to be a fine of some kind, but when she pulls it out, it’s a note. Written in black pen in a style that is somehow so ugly and so beautiful at once, reads:</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>See you tomorrow sweetheart ;)</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>And signed at the bottom with a simple heart. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha thinks this could be worse than a fine. </span>
</p><p>
<span>God, Rio better not screw everything up. </span>

<b>11 years earlier</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed to herself, tapping her finger against the glass countertop as she watched the two customers in the store make their way around, looking at all of the different vinyls and instruments. It was a small record store that she got a job from pretty easily after starting college. It wasn’t much, but she didn't need to manipulate her way into the job for once, her boss didn’t really care that much about who they hired, she was just in the right place at the right time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The bell above the door chimed, and Agatha looked towards it, a grin tugging at her lips as Rio walked in, as casual as ever. Her eyes met Agatha’s, almost instinctively, as if she just knew exactly where she’d be standing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Well, well, well, if it isn’t my favourite employee,” Rio said, as she made her way over to where Agatha stood. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, leaning down so that her elbow rested on the counter, and her head could rest in her palm, “is that all I am? Your favourite employee of a record store with two employees?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hummed in thought, and Agatha resisted the urge to close the distance between them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh I’m sorry, my shining light, your presence on this earth makes the world a bit more survivable, my favourite, utterly perf-,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t get to finish the sentence, because Agatha’s hand was suddenly on her mouth, laughing as the other two customers looked over at them in confusion. Agatha tried to calm her laughing, but Rio’s eyes were pure mischief…and she just felt so happy. After a few seconds however, Rio nipped her teeth at Agatha’s fingers, and she instinctively pulled away. She gave a half hearted scowl, but Rio just smiled proudly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t you have class, or something productive to do?” Agatha questioned. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilted her head, her fingers idly drumming against the counter to the song playing quietly over the speakers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Admit it, you love that I’m here, you’d miss me if I was doing something </span>
<em>
<span>productive,</span>
</em>
<span>” Rio answered, giving the last word air quotes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha snorted, glancing over at the two customers who were now just plainly eavesdropping. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you ever think maybe </span>
<em>
<span>I’d </span>
</em>
<span>get something productive done without you here?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio feigned hurt, stumbling backwards as she clutched at her chest, “I skipped class and came all this way to brighten your day and you-,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please,” Agatha interrupted, “you were talking about dropping out two days ago, don’t pretend like this is a big sacrifice,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes, “that may be so,” she paused, leaning closer. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could smell her scent this close, familiar, and earthy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“But </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> is a real worthy cause,” Rio continued, her voice lowering in the way that sent shivers down Agatha’s spine. She lingered a moment too long, before casually pulling away to wander over to the nearest shelf of records. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So…anything you recommend in the world of music?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tried her best to keep a straight face. She didn’t want to let Rio know she was totally endeared by her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Only my most loyal customers get recommendations, those who actually </span>
<em>
<span>buy</span>
</em>
<span> something, rather than flirting with the employees,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio feigned innocence, glancing around the room as if to say </span>
<em>
<span>who, me?</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s not very professional of you Mrs Vidal,” Rio stated.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed, rolling her eyes and desperately trying to ignore the way her heart fluttered in her chest. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shut up, Rio,” is all she could respond with. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio just smiled at her, eyes twinkling with energy and affection. Agatha knew Rio was just trying to get under her skin, and make her feel flustered, but boy was it working. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t ever buy anything because A, I’m broke, and B, I know a girl who can write and sing better than any other artist in here,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled softly, and God, she really wanted to kiss her girlfriend. Rio seemed to have the same idea, as she made her way back over to Agatha, and reached out to gently grab her face to pull her closer. However, Agatha stopped, just before their lips met, and Rio frowned. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s customers here, I’m working,” Agatha whispered, and Rio sighed dramatically, flinging her head back. Agatha smiled, but then a moment later, watched as Rio seemed to come up with an idea; never a good sign. Rio winked at her, before making her way over to the couple still browsing items. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Heya there folks, you buying this today?” Rio asked, gesturing to the vinyl in the man’s hand. Without waiting for an answer, she snatched it out of his hands and began walking backwards towards Agatha, “a great album, great choice, we’ll ring that right up for you just follow me,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman tried to interrupt, but Rio didn’t give her space to, just exclaiming things about the record as she reached over the counter and grabbed the barcode scanner, scanning the item despite Agatha’s attempts to snatch it back. Rio only paused to look over at the price on the screen, before walking back over to the couple and telling them the number and holding out her palm. The two looked between one another, and then at Agatha, but Agatha was having too much fun watching this and didn’t give them much to work with. The man finally sighed, handing what Agatha hoped was the correct amount to Rio (Rio didn’t even glance to see if it was right). </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Perfect, come back around soon, have a great day, ta ta,” Rio rushed out, as she ushered the two of them to the door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched in amused disbelief as the bell chimed again, signalling the couple’s exit. Rio turned back around, expression triumphant as she made her way back over to the counter. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re terrible,” Agatha commented, watching as Rio made her way around the counter and into the staff area where Agatha had been standing. She placed the money onto the counter, but Agatha didn’t pay that much mind. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s voice deepened again, her expression changing to pure </span>
<em>
<span>want</span>
</em>
<span>, “mhm yeah I am,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Insufferable,” Agatha continued, but it was more of a half hearted whisper, her eyes only focused on Rio’s lips, as the woman slowly approached, reaching out her arms on either side of Agatha, trapping her against the counter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And you love me for it,” Rio murmured, her breath hot against Agatha’s face. Agatha couldn’t answer, she just nodded. Rio finally closed the distance, and Agatha couldn’t help but smile against Rio’s lips. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha spent all night and all morning dreading showing up to rehearsal. Their first day as a unified band; Agatha, Billy, Jen, Alice…and Rio. If it were any other time, Agatha would find a way to postpone the rehearsal at least for another day, but with their big performance in three weeks, she unfortunately did not have the time to do so, and Lilia would probably kill her if she found out. Agatha knew she somehow always did find out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>That performance is going to be their biggest one yet. It’s been what the band had been working toward, and now it was just on the horizon. Agatha had internally been slightly concerned over the possibility of lacking a drummer, but now, she doesn’t know what’s worse, having no drummer, or dealing with Rio. The worst part is that Agatha knows Rio can handle it. She knows that somehow Rio will be able to immediately catch up to the others and put on a show as if she had been playing those songs for 50 years. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hates that she knows this already. She hates that she knows Rio will come in and play so effortlessly and have that absent minded look on her face as if she were people watching rather than performing difficult songs in front of an audience. And she hates that she knows it won’t last, because with Rio, it never does. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When Agatha arrives for their first rehearsal, she plasters on a fake, theatrical smile, using it to mask the metaphorical hole in her chest that she thought one day </span>
<em>
<span>just maybe</span>
</em>
<span> could be healed over. But now, she knows that instead, it’ll probably just keep growing bigger. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She takes a deep breath, before twisting the door handle and marching in as if she had never experienced any woes in her entire life. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Her gaze sweeps around the room as she enters, bypassing Billy strumming absentmindedly on his guitar, Jen adjusting her tuning of her bass, and Alice reorganising her sheet music as her eyes almost instinctively land on Rio, sitting in the corner and making adjustments to a drum set she’s not totally used to. She seems to be dissociating while doing so, the fuzzy look in her eyes that Agatha was often used to, still present. Agatha feels the knot in her stomach twist, and she can’t tell for what reason, all she knows is that it’s Rio’s presence that’s doing so. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Good morning, everyone! Ready to make some…</span>
<em>
<span>magic?</span>
</em>
<span>” Agatha calls out, her voice immediately so bright that she almost flinches herself. Everyone in the band immediately looks amongst each other, in pure confusion and with a tinge of fear. Agatha is purposefully avoiding making another glance toward Rio’s area of the room, but still, she can hear her half scoff, half laugh that Agatha can immediately picture in her head; Rio tilting to look at the ground, before slowly shaking her head and poking her cheek with her tongue, she doesn’t even need to glance around at her. For a moment, the sound makes Agatha pause and the hair on her arms stands up, but before anyone has a chance to question it, she heads over to the microphone stand. Everyone goes back to what they were doing, and it gives Agatha a chance to take another breath as she messes around with the height of the microphone, as if she weren’t the last person to use it. No one seems to question it thankfully, but now Agatha can continuously feel the heat of Rio’s eyes against her back. Agatha has only been in the room for about 30 seconds and it already feels suffocating. Rio’s gaze, Rio’s smile, Rio’s sounds, just her being here makes Agatha feel nauseous. The memories that she’s spent so long trying to ignore, all coming back in one big swing. The soft, loving, sweet times, and the painful, ugly, hurtful memories of the end and the after. It all feels too much right now. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>But she can’t think like that. Not now, not when it could impact the band. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wouldn’t let Rio ruin her chances of musical success. </span>
<em>
<span>Not again. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Alright, time to get started,” Agatha says, adjusting her tone to something more natural for her, more confident and commanding. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, Agatha, have you finished up that song you were writing for the performance?” Billy asks. His voice is his usual light and youthful, but the words still make Agatha bristle for a second. Her eyes flick to Rio for less than a second, before pulling them toward Billy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes! Almost there, don’t you worry about that, kid,” Billy goes to speak, but Agatha already knows what he’s going to say, “</span>
<em>
<span>sorry</span>
</em>
<span>, teenager, I know,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy nods, and offers a polite smile as he brings his fingers to his strings. </span>
</p><p>
<span>All Agatha can feel is Rio’s eyes burning a hole into the side of her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Truthfully, Agatha is nowhere near finishing the song. She writes all of the band's music, and normally it came naturally to her. Making the songs is what made her love what she does, and what made her initially interested in music. The singing has always just been a bonus for a person of her theatrics. However, she promised to write a new song three weeks ago for their big concert, yet every time she has sitten down to get something written on paper, her mind goes blank. And now Rio’s back in her life. She tries not to think about how that will impact her songwriting ability.</span>
</p><p>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio’s gaze feels continuously lingering, despite neither of them sharing a singular word to one another since entering. Agatha just knows that Rio can see straight through her, through her masks and her lies. It’s infuriating, but Agatha tries her best to ignore it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“We good to go?” Agatha questions, not really caring about anyone’s response. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah. Rio, are you okay with this?” Alice asks, and everyone’s head turns to Rio. Agatha however very obviously looks on the opposing side of the room.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m all set, Alice. Never been better,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The words sound so normal, yet they still grate on Agatha’s nerves as she instinctively searches for the real meaning and hidden remarks against Agatha amongst the words. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jen?” Agatha simply says, and Jen nods in understanding as she begins to play the opening chords, leading the song in. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As one by one, the others join in, Agatha finally turns her head completely to face Rio, making purposeful direct eye contact. Rio stares back, before raising an eyebrow as she spins a drumstick in her hand. Agatha feels the need to look away, the tension between them palpable. Instead, she just watches as Rio naturally begins to bring a drum beat to the song, never breaking eye contact with Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A few moments later, and it’s Agatha’s cue to come in. She wrote this song. She’s sung it a hundred times. She doesn’t need to look back at the sheet music…so she doesn’t. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>After around three minutes, the song comes to an end, and Agatha finally tears her eyes away from Rio’s, ignoring the ever present smirk on the woman’s face. Agatha looks around the room at her other band members, before realising they’re all giving her the same almost-shocked look. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha demands immediately. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The other three share a knowing look before Jen speaks, “uh…what was that?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What was </span>
<em>
<span>what</span>
</em>
<span>?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen gives Agatha a purposeful look, before glancing over at Rio. Agatha’s eyes follow her, and watch as Rio just casually tilts her head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It doesn’t really matter,” Billy cuts in, “but I think that went really well, did it not?</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallows, fidgeting with the microphone chord, “it went fine, let’s go from the top again?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The others nod, and this time, Agatha’s eyes remain firmly planted on the blank wall on the opposing side of the room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The days pass and rehearsals seem to grow longer by the second. Agatha knows she’s delaying the inevitable, but she refuses to allow any sort of circumstance where she and Rio are left alone in the same room. Simply her presence, her looks, and the clear thoughts circulating around that brain of her’s makes Agatha feel on edge. Agatha can tell the rest of the band sense the difference in Agatha, they can tell see the slight pause in each decision she makes, but they don’t bother her over it fortunately for her. Rio remains pleasant the majority of the time, playing along in silence, but of course she’s unable to help herself from mentions of teasing and the smirks that Agatha feels like she can constantly see in her periphery.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha hasn’t been sleeping well. Her thoughts are too foggy; replaying every pointed look Rio gives her throughout the day, or forcing herself to shake off the whispers her other bandmates are sharing about them. And then there’s the song. Every day she spends an hour at night, sitting in front of her notepad, trying to get </span>
<em>
<span>something</span>
</em>
<span> on that page, but the closest she gets to anything of worth is drawing a stick figure of Rio and then aggressively scribbling it out until there is no sight of her left, or her pencil breaks (it only happened once, okay?).  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>One night, Agatha decides to stay behind late after rehearsal to try and get something out on the page. It doesn’t take long however, for her to regret that decision. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha is lying on the floor, throwing a crumpled piece of paper in the air and catching it when the rehearsal room door opens. She quickly turns to face it, as the ball of paper falls straight into the centre of her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha groans, bringing her hand to her face as she watches Rio catch sight of the woman on the floor. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She smirks, leaning against the door frame. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hello, Agatha,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you want?” Agatha immediately responds, moving to sit upright. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugs, “nothing, I just forgot my water bottle,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha narrows her eyes, “you don’t have a drink bottle, what are you really doing here?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffs out a laugh, pushing herself away from the door frame and walking over to the drumset. She then reaches down behind it, appearing with a green bottle in hand. She tilts her head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn’t even bother responding. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t know you’d be here so late,” Rio says, sauntering over, “you writing?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t see how that’s relevant to you or not,” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Rio makes a ‘tut’ noise with her tongue, “so cynical, Agatha,” she teases.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha averts her eyes and looks down at the notebook beside her, half the pages already ripped out of it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“You know…if you need a song, you could always use-,” Rio starts, but Agatha cuts her off. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighs, shaking her head with a smile, “you didn’t even know what I was about to suggest,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turns to face her, staring her dead in the eyes, unsmiling. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes I do. Even after all this time, somehow I always know,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smile doesn’t waver, but she lifts an eyebrow, before letting out a breathy laugh. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s a good song, Agatha,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And I wrote it when I was 18. We don’t need to rehash ancient history just because you’re back here,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugs, leaning against a nearby wall, “</span>
<em>
<span>we?</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha, all I’m trying to do is play some music, it’s not my fault simply being around me brings up stuff for you,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Isn’t it?” Agatha snaps, her voice sharp. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, Rio’s smile falters. For a second, it’s as if Agatha sees a flicker of something softer passing over Rio’s face, but it’s gone as quick as it came. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I didn’t come back for you, Agatha,” she says, voice low, but Agatha can still hear the slight rawness in her voice, again knowing her too well. “I’m here because a band needed a drummer, and I am a fucking good one,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha so desperately wants to look away and avoid the piercing gaze she knows so well. But she forces herself to hold her ground.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Funny, that. There are a whole bunch of better bands than this. Yet you somehow manage to worm your way into the thing I have built from the ground up. If you’re so good, you could easily manipulate your way into a bigger, better band than this. You’ve done it before, haven’t you?”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio lets out a humourless laugh, “you always think the worst of me,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha shakes her head, “</span>
<em>
<span>You made me </span>
</em>
<span>think the worst of you, Rio. You chose everyone over me…over us. I’m not going to apologise for thinking that any day now, you’ll do the same again,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jesus,” Rio mutters, pushing herself off the wall, “Okay Agatha, you keep writing those picture perfect songs that don’t mean anything to you. But don’t come crying to me when you realise they don’t mean anything to anyone else either.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha finally pushes herself to stand. Rio’s words cut deeper than she wants to admit, but she focuses all that hurt on anger instead. As Rio makes her way to the door Agatha calls out, “don’t just walk away like that,” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She hears Rio sigh, as she stops in her tracks, hand hovering over the door knob. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve said it all Agatha, there’s no point arguing about it anymore.” She turns around. “We both know you’re not going to get over your emotions any time soon,” she takes a deep breath, sounding deflated, “I just– I don’t know what the fuck you want from me, Agatha. You want me to leave, and now you don’t want me to leave, because now you’re too terrified of facing yourself. What am I supposed to do with that?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha takes a step forward, fist clenched at her side. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m tired of you making it sound like I’m the problem, I’m not the one who left.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>A flicker of </span>
<em>
<span>something</span>
</em>
<span> crosses Rio’s face as she crosses her arms, something Agatha recognises, something she doesn’t want to acknowledge.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You knew how important that night was for me, Rio. And then I fucking find out, while I’m standing side stage, that you’re off, performing with some other band that I didn’t know shit about!?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pokes her cheek with her tongue, slowly shaking her head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t act like you weren’t already pushing me away when you became so obsessed with that fucking label.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I was trying to make us into something important,” Agatha argues. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah well, it felt like I didn’t exist to you anymore. You became so desperate for their validation that you never bothered to even check how I felt about the music </span>
<em>
<span>we </span>
</em>
<span>were making.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And so instead of fighting for me you just decided to get up and run away from all of your problems?” </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, it’s like something in Rio chips away, and suddenly she’s moving closer to Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you think I don’t regret it? Maybe if I hadn’t </span>
<em>
<span>fucked up</span>
</em>
<span> we both wouldn’t be in this disgusting building playing songs that you could’ve written in your sleep back then?” her steps are slow, and deliberate, “but it’s far too late to be thinking on those </span>
<em>
<span>what if’s</span>
</em>
<span>, Agatha. It’s time to grow the fuck up,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>She’s in Agatha’s space now. Their chests move in synchrony through the adrenalin and heavy breathing. Agatha stares into Rio’s eyes, seeing their history of hurt and pain and love reflected back into her own. It’s too much, and it’s not enough. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Fuck you,” Agatha whispers, her voice low. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Rio can respond, Agatha is grabbing the front of her shirt, pulling her forward until their lips crash together. Rio seems to hesitate for a second, but when her brain catches up, the kiss becomes rough and desperate and filled with so many emotions. It’s almost as if Agatha can taste the anger and the adoration on Rio’s tongue. It’s not soft, but instead as if every heated gaze, every teasing comment, every insult is pouring out in an uncontrollable rush. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When they finally pull apart, they’re both breathless. Agatha’s chest rises and falls rapidly, as Rio looks at her with such confusion and somehow softness despite all that was said. Agatha swallows roughly, taking in every detail of Rio’s face. Her slightly swollen lips, her breathlessness, the way her eyes flick across Agatha’s face. Then, despite a part of her screaming to stay where she is, Agatha takes a step backwards, falling out of Rio’s embrace. She rubs at her neck, looking to the floor. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was a mistake,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio breathes out, as if she had just been hit in the stomach with a bat. Agatha closes her eyes tightly before continuing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t let this get any more complicated. I can’t…” she pauses, “I can’t go through all of this again.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighs, biting her lip anxiously as she looks down at the floor. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, Agatha,” her voice is full of resignation. She takes a step backward, and the distance between them feels as far as those years without even an ounce of contact. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha takes a few steps backward, before spinning around and leaving the room. She doesn’t even bother grabbing her notepad or anything. She just can’t bear to see that look on Rio’s face again. The door clicks shut behind her. She doesn’t look back. Because if she does, she knows she’ll probably go running back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, she leaves Rio behind in a room too full of memories. </span>

<p>
<span>Agatha rushed down the hallway towards her apartment, smiling brightly and somehow not tripping over her own feet as she sped around the corner in her long dress. Her heart was pounding and her mind racing with a million ideas as she twisted her door handle, calling out before the door even closed behind her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio! You’ll never guess what happened,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who died?” Rio questioned, her voice coming from the kitchen. Agatha rolled her eyes as she followed the voice, slipping off her coat on the way. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t sound so excited,” she responded, turning the corner and seeing Rio wiping her hands on her pants. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled softly, as she tilted her head, “okay fine, what is it?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know that label I was telling you about? Darkhold Records?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded, moving toward Agatha to brush some strands of hair out of her face that she’d ignored due to the excitement.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re looking for more talent, </span>
<em>
<span>and </span>
</em>
<span>they’re going to be at that showcase we’re performing at next month!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s face split into a grin, as she wrapped her arms around Agatha’s waist, pulling her close. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Doesn’t shock me, not when we’re playing your songs,” she said, her tone bordered on teasing but the words were true. Agatha smiled back at her, before kissing the corner of Rio’s mouth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This could be it, Rio. This is our </span>
<em>
<span>chance</span>
</em>
<span> to prove that we’re more than just some ordinary musicians,” Agatha explained, walking out of Rio’s hold and beginning to pace around in thought. Rio just watched her, eyebrow raised. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve been working your ass off writing this songs, Agatha. We just got to bring the energy, and play some of your best songs, and we’ll get them,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha paused, her mind beginning to race of ideas, the opportunities, the risks. This was everything she ever dreamed of, and that meant everything was now on the line. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We have to be better than that, better than anything we’ve ever done before,” she started, eyes widening in excitement, “new songs, new energy, new everything,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyebrows immediately furrowed, as she watched Agatha’s figure move back and forth. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Woah, I mean…Agatha, new everything is…a bit extreme, don’t you think?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, the idea of something </span>
<em>
<span>more</span>
</em>
<span>, bubbling through her veins. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“This isn’t some other gig. This is Darkhold. They hold more power than any other label around here. They don’t want </span>
<em>
<span>good</span>
</em>
<span> or our </span>
<em>
<span>usual</span>
</em>
<span>. They want something groundbreaking and spectacular. And that’s what we’ll be,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hesitated, before walking over to Agatha once more. Carefully, her arm raised to press her cold hand against Agatha’s cheek, forcing her to look into her eyes. They stood like that for a moment, before Rio nodded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, Agatha,” she almost whispered. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, satisfied by Rio’s answer. She leaned in, giving her a haste kiss on the lips before she marched over to the dining table and collected her writing pad. Agatha’s mind was immediately flooded with endless possibilities, her heart beating steadily in her chest as she began to put all of her minds effort into the pencil and paper in front of her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha remained there the rest of the day, fully focused on her music. Rio hovered around, checking on her every now and again. Agatha got like this sometimes, but Rio knew that it would be over before she knew it. Agatha didn’t even realise that Rio was coming and going from where she sat until she looked up and realised it was pitch black outside, her hand aching from the pain of writing. By the time she realised, Rio was already asleep on the couch. Agatha was about to stand, and go to bed, her eyes aching slightly from the lack of sleep. However, as she looked over at Rio’s splayed out sleeping body, another idea came to her, and she just </span>
<em>
<span>had </span>
</em>
<span>to write it down. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha sits on the worn out couch in the rehearsal space, her knee bouncing as she takes another sip of her black coffee. She looks down at her notebook in front of her, all the pages blank or covered in scribbles. Her head pounds from her lack of sleep. It has been three days since she kissed Rio, and three days since she had gotten more than 3 hours of sleep. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Every time she closes her eyes it’s as if she can feel the familiar pressure of Rio’s lips against her own, and she can’t be dealing with that. Not right now, not ever again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, did you hear me?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tears her eyes away from her notepad, immediately turning her eyes to Billy who was clearly trying to say soemthign to her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shakes herself out of her thoughts.</span>
</p><p>
<span> “What?” she demands, her voice sharper than intended. Billy takes a cautious step back. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh, we’re gonna go again in five, is that…okay?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha waves her hand in the air, and Billy takes that as the acceptance he needs as he rushes back over to where Alice is eating her lunch. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes go back toward her notebook, but on the way, they catch at the sight of Rio, already staring at her from across the room, twirling a drumstick. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyebrow is raised, but it’s not accompanied by her usual smirk. Instead, there’s a slight tinge of concern on her features that Agatha doesn’t feel like reading in to. She goes back to looking at the blank pages. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The tension between Agatha and Rio has been thick over the past few days. Rio hasn’t made any teasing remarks. She doesn’t try to catch Agatha on her way out, or leave notes on her windscreen. The only time Agatha speaks to her is when she’s giving her…</span>
<em>
<span>constructive</span>
</em>
<span> criticism. Which means Rio has been getting a lot of it. No correlation there, of course. Still, Rio takes it all in stride, not once arguing back like she normally does. It makes Agatha feel nauseous. The idea that something’s wrong. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>For the next week, rehearsals continue. And they feel suffocating. As soon as Agatha enters, it’s as if the room falls silent, everyone holding their breath. It’s as if nothing anyone does is right anymore. Even at the slightest inconsistency, Agatha stops singing, staring daggers at whoever falls behind even for a second. No one is safe. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When Billy accidentally misses a singular note after a long day, Agatha turns on him in an instant. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What the hell is wrong with you? This is a simple song that you’ve played a hundred times! Are you good? Is anyone in there?” She demands, miming knocking on his head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy stares at her, mouth agape as he attempts to stutter out any kind of word, but before he gets the chance, Agatha is already yelling out, “from the top! Don’t fuck this one up!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When Alice misses a cue by a second, Agatha stops rehearsals entirely, calling for a 10 minute break for what the others believe to be no reason and disrupting their practice. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When Agatha tells Jen her backup vocals are flat, Alice has to practically hold Jennifer back from treating her bass as a baseball bat.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And Rio? Rio gets the worst of it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio is somehow </span>
<em>
<span>perfect </span>
</em>
<span>every goddamn time, and it drives Agatha insane. She can’t help but make things up. Even when Rio plays their most complicated songs to perfection, Agatha finds </span>
<em>
<span>something </span>
</em>
<span>wrong, whether it be her breathing too loudly, or even her posture being </span>
<em>
<span>too stiff</span>
</em>
<span>, or </span>
<em>
<span>too relaxed</span>
</em>
<span>. It’s never enough, and it’s never right. It’s like Agatha can’t hold back the monstrous flood of anger inside of her. Every single thing Rio does or doesn’t do, grates on her nerves. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And Rio never flinches. Not once. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>In truth, all Agatha wants is a reaction. She needs to feel the power she has over them all. The way Jen’s eyes flicker with rage, or Alice gives a roll of her eyes, or Billy takes a nervous step away. All of it shows Agatha what she can do. When she can’t control her thoughts, or her ability to write, she knows she can influence them. It makes some part of her feel a tiny bit better, even for a split second before disappitating into the nothingness. But Rio never gives her </span>
<em>
<span>anything.</span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>One day, it just gets too much for her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re going from the fucking top!” Agatha exclaims, feeling a rush at the sounds of sighs and groans surrounding her as she takes a step from the microphone. Her eyes, as always, find themselves staring at Rio, who’s just staring back at her, her expression completely unreadable. It makes Agatha snap. As the others all prepare for the song again, Agatha holds out a hand in pause. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Let me hear just Rio,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The room around her freezes, as all eyes go from Agatha to Rio in almost planned synchrony. Still, Rio’s face doesn’t change. She simply starts from the top. Of course, it’s perfection. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha feels her heartrate increase, as her hands clench by her side. It’s almost as if she is wishing, or praying that Rio makes a mistake. Why can’t she just falter for a second like every other goddamn human being. But Rio’s calm, practiced perfection only makes Agatha’s skin crawl. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Stop,” Agatha calls out. There’s no reason for it, but Rio freezes immediately anyway in such a casual way. She looks over at Agatha, as if waiting for her verdict. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do it again. Better this time,” is all Agatha says. Rio doesn’t even nod, just goes back from the top. </span>
</p><p>
<span>This time, Agatha cuts in earlier. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Too fast, do it again,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio does it again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you trying to look like your dead inside, we need energy. Again,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>And again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Your grip is distracting. Again.” </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>And again. </span>
</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The cycle continues, everyone’s eyes flitting between Agatha and Rio constantly. Every criticism, Agatha’s voice gets sharper, as her nails dig into her own thighs. It gets too much. It’s all too much. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Stop!” Agatha finally yells, breath coming sharp and heavy. Rio stops, slowly lifting her eyes to meet Agatha’s. Her gaze isn’t mad, or annoyed, or anything. The only possible noticeable thing is a flicker of sadness. It’s not good enough for Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What the fuck do you think you’re doing?” Agatha questions, and it’s as if the other band members are suddenly holding their breaths. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Playing the song,” Rio replies, voice as calm as ever. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffs, “</span>
<em>
<span>playing the song</span>
</em>
<span>. I mean what you’re </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> doing, Rio?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s expression is calm, carefully considered. Agatha barely notices the way Jen, Alice and Billy all seem suddenly very interested in the ceiling. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighs, “I don’t know what you want me to say, Agatha,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>And there it is again, the familiar way in which the name falls from Rio’s tongue, breathy, and as if each syllable matters. It just makes Agatha angrier. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you even want to be here?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, Rio’s calm expression cracks as she can’t help but roll her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jesus, Agatha. Do you really think someone who doesn’t want to be here would be willing to play the same song as many times as I have in the last half hour? What more do you want from me? </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shoots to her feet, arms flying out dramatically at her sides. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe I just want you to admit it, Rio. Admit that this is all some </span>
<em>
<span>casual</span>
</em>
<span> game to you like always and that you’re just going to leave any day now,” </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The room falls completely silent, the only noise filling it being Agatha’s breathing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looks at her, her facade falling slightly as a glint of hurt flickers across her features. Agatha doesn’t care. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, Rio speaks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Looks like we’re playing the same parts we used to then, Agatha. The runaway bandmate and the musician who’s going to kill herself trying to hide herself under hundreds of layers of walls she has built to keep everyone else out, unable even to show her real self through the lyrics she writes,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The words feel like a punch to the gut, and Agatha takes an instinctive step backwards as if physically been hurt. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The others remain silent, all shocked in what’s unfolding in front of them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tries to think of something to shoot back, but she knows none of them will get any sort of reaction. Her lips are pressed into a thin line, her hand curling and uncurling by her side. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“I think we’re done for the day.” Agatha finally states. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Immediately the other three bandmates stand, rushing to collect their things and escape the room filled to the brim with tension. Agatha just continues to stare at Rio. Rio stares back. Neither of them have a readable expression, just a million emotions pouring out and directed at the other. Agatha breaks first, swallowing harshly as she suddenly turns away and walks out of the room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>*** </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<b>8 years earlier</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stood side stage, arms crossed and foot tapping anxiously on the ground. She could hear the sounds of the crowd out in the audience, probably a few hundred people, all getting energy ramped up each set that came out. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Scratch</span>
</em>
<span> was next. Agatha and Rio were next.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had been preparing for weeks. She wrote new songs, threw out old ones, lost sleep, and spent all of her days trying to ooze out creativity in a way she had never done before. And now the night was finally here. Darkhold Records were out there, waiting for them – waiting for </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span> – to come out on stage. This was their chance. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“How much longer?” She asked, turning to the stage manager. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The man looked at his watch, “15 minutes. Is your girl going to be here in time?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s shoulders tensed, “she’ll be here.” She tried to sound confident, but inside the knot in her stomach tightened. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Five minutes passed. Agatha tried not to notice the way all of the backstage crew shared awkward glances, checking their watches. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>Another two minutes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Look, Agatha. We’re going to have to bump you, we’re cutting it too-,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, don’t. She’s…she’s going to show up,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Five minutes. Agatha felt physically sick. She walked away from being so close to the stage, taking a deep breath as she glanced around for any sign of Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>None. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha made eye contact with the stage manager, his face full of pity. Without saying a word to Agatha, he pressed a button on his headset, still staring right at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tell The Thunderbolts that they’re on next, we’re bumping Scratch.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart plummeted. Agatha rarely cried, and she didn’t know either. She was </span>
<em>
<span>furious</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The stage manager gave her an apologetic shrug, before going back to his job. She couldn’t be here, she couldn’t watch as someone else got what she wanted so desperately. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She felt like she couldn’t breathe, the fury and the disappointment and the disguised hurt filling her entire body. Without saying a word to anyone, Agatha shoved her way out of backstage and toward the exit. And she didn’t stop. The night was cold, the wind hitting her face in a cold breeze. She just kept walking. She didn’t know where she was walking to, but she simply had to be out of there. After a few minutes, she saw a payphone and marched toward it. She put a few coins in, and dialled the number to their apartment, the only place she could imagine Rio being. Maybe there was some excuse, she fell sick, she was kidnapped, something horrible that Agatha could forgive. Because right now, she didn’t know what was going to happen to them. </span>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The phone went to voicemail. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a deep sigh. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We missed it. We lost the chance. It’s all gone, Rio. It’s all gone.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>She wanted to sound angry, to yell into the phone. But all that came out was pained words. It was all too much. She hung up the phone, half expecting it to ring back, to have Rio magically appear with an excuse good enough. But she didn’t. Tears began to appear in the corner of her eyes, but she blinked them away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And then, like some cruel joke the universe was playing on her, Agatha heard music. It was faint but recognisable. The sound of a band playing nearby. And because she hates herself, she supposes, she found herself walking towards the noise. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was a slightly bigger venue than the one she was supposed to perform at, but the crowd was definitely more packed and the energy was purely electric. Agatha made her way through the crowd, almost as if she were possessed.  The song they were playing was…undeniably good, and everyone around her seemed to know the lyrics, singing and dancing along. Despite herself, she found herself enjoying the sound, just for a second remembering her love for music over her interest in success and power. But that’s when the drum solo hit. Agatha’s breath caught in her throat. She recognised it too well, the power, the perfect timing, everything about it screamed Rio Vidal. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Filled with adrenalin, Agatha continued to shove her way through the crowd to get a better look, more aggressive this time. When she was just a few people from the front, she finally got a good look. Behind the drum kit, lost in the music, was Rio, her face devoid of any real emotions, just enjoying the rhythm. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her chest tighten, and her stomach lurched. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The crowd shoved Agatha slightly, and she shoved back, before moving her way right to the front of the stage, ignoring the annoyed glances and whispers people were suddenly sharing about her. She didn’t bother yelling out. The music was too loud, and the people were too excited. She just watched. Rio looked beautiful. She was in her element, and for the first time, Agatha hated her for it. She didn’t understand how Rio could look so content and be so effortless as if Agatha’s dreams hadn’t just been destroyed and disintegrated to dust in front of her.</span>
</p><p>
<span><br/>
</span>
<span>The song hit a crescendo, as the crowd all screamed and cheered. Agatha remained expressionless, standing her ground as she watched the band all stand from their positions, waving at the crowd, Rio joining in as if she were a part of them. </span>
<em>
<span>Because she was?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you everyone for showing up tonight! We have been the Salem Seven, goodnight!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>The Salem Seven</span>
</em>
<span>. Agatha recognised the name, people were talking about them a lot in recent times, and Agatha could see why. Agatha clenched her fists tightly, making half moon  shaped scars on the palm of her hand. She watched on as the band all began to head side stage, watching Rio and Rio alone. As if sensing it, Rio turned back for a second, looking once more over the crowd with a half smirk. Then, her eyes caught Agatha’s. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She almost tripped on stage, eyebrows furrowed in confusion. She paused, before she continued off stage. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Oh the nerve. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Without thinking about it, Agatha stormed toward the side stage, ignoring the security’s weak attempts at stopping her. It didn’t take long to spot Rio, nodding along to another one of </span>
<em>
<span>her bandmates</span>
</em>
<span> talking with a bright smile. However, it didn’t take much for Rio to realise Agatha was approaching, turning to face her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, you’re here,” Rio said, half smiling. She sounded half shocked, half happy. But her smile quickly faded once she saw the flurry of emotions flying across Agatha’s face.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you think I wouldn’t find out?” Agatha spat, and immediately Rio’s face paled slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, it’s not that big of a deal,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Not that big of a deal</span>
</em>
<span>? You’ve been playing with another band and didn’t bother to tell me? Your music partner? The one you made your other band with? Your </span>
<em>
<span>girlfriend</span>
</em>
<span>?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced over her shoulder at the other band members of The Salem Seven, who didn’t seem to be very interested in Agatha’s appearance. Still, Rio wordlessly grabbed Agatha by the wrist and began pulling her to the exit.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What the hell are you doing?” Agatha exclaimed, and Rio sighed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I just want to talk,” she responded, still pulling Agatha along. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh so, </span>
<em>
<span>now </span>
</em>
<span>you want to talk?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes Agatha, </span>
<em>
<span>now </span>
</em>
<span>I want to talk,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio finally pulled Agatha out the door, leading in the two of them standing in an alleyway outside the building. Two people sat on the ground, smoking something. Rio just stared at them for a second too long and they both scuttled away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay Agatha,” Rio breathed, sounding tired, “what’s the matter now,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mouth opened slightly, shocked at Rio’s frustrated tone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s the matter now?” Agatha repeated, voice shaking from anger, “I don’t know Rio, maybe it’s the fact I find out that you’ve been having a secret life with one of the most talked about bands around, or </span>
<em>
<span>maybe</span>
</em>
<span> that you chose </span>
<em>
<span>them</span>
</em>
<span> over performing with </span>
<em>
<span>me </span>
</em>
<span>for Darkhold Records tonight,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio froze. It was so rare to see Rio surprised by something, nevermind frozen from it. Rio blinked rapidly, trying to come to terms with the words out of Agatha’s mouth. Her mouth opened, and then closed again, before she muttered, “that’s not- no, it can’t-,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah well it is, or should I say </span>
<em>
<span>was,</span>
</em>
<span>” Agatha responded. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took in a deep breath, before closing her eyes tightly and bringing her hand to the bridge of her nose.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t act like you didn’t know. It’s all I’ve been talking to you about for weeks,” Agatha continued, each word sharp and bitter, “and you chose them over me. Over us.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a long beat before Rio spoke. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, I was just trying to do my job,” she tried to say, but it was clear that she was still coming to terms with what had happened, “I didn’t mean for this-,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a step forward, her words trailing off as she reached for Agatha’s arm. As soon as her fingertips made contact, Agatha pulled away. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Don’t</span>
</em>
<span>,” she hissed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>There was a heavy tense pause, both of them not quite sure what to do. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And then,” Agatha finally continued, voice quiet, “I found out by accident that you’re here? And you never told me. Why wouldn’t you tell me?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t tell you about this because I didn’t think you’d care.” Rio rushed out, as if unable to hold it in any longer, “Scratch is called that because </span>
<em>
<span>we </span>
</em>
<span>made it from scratch. But all of a sudden it’s become yours, and it’s not even </span>
<em>
<span>yours,</span>
</em>
<span> it’s like some fake version of you that doesn’t care about being authentic anymore. You have been so…wrapped up in trying to remanufacture yourself lately that every time I say something, it just seems to go out the other ear. This Darkhold stuff has made you become a ghost, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t you dare try and turn this on me. I have been killing myself trying to make this work for </span>
<em>
<span>us. </span>
</em>
<span>And you didn’t even bother to show up.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, please,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart twisted, but she tried her best to ignore it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Turns out you’ve been secretly building a second career and second life, while I’ve been at least </span>
<em>
<span>trying </span>
</em>
<span>to build something for us together. You’ve been slipping away, bit by bit, and I didn’t even see it. I didn’t even </span>
<em>
<span>feel</span>
</em>
<span> it until tonight.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a step back, eyes widening. At that moment, both of them knew what this was. Rio began to slowly shake her head. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ll work something out. Just because we didn’t get Darkhold Records tonight doesn’t mean Scratch is over, Agatha. It doesn’t mean </span>
<em>
<span>we</span>
</em>
<span> are.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swallowed harshly, trying to hold back the sudden urge to cry. Rio’s words felt suffocating, and useless. Agatha was too hurt. Rio had taken a part of her that night that Agatha was holding onto so tightly. She didn’t see any point in continuing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t think we see this the same anymore,” Agatha explained, her voice almost breaking mid-sentence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We were just teenagers when we started this. We’ve outgrown it,” she continued with a shrug, “I think we’re on different paths. Maybe we always were.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t say anything, just turned to look at the ground, moving her tongue anxiously around her mouth. Finally after a few moments, she looked up, face terrifyingly neutral. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, Agatha,” </span>
</p><p>"Goodbye, Rio,"<br/>Rio licked her lips, as if struggling to respond.<br/>"Te veo,"</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded slowly, and without saying another word, she turned sharply and began walking away. Her chest ached, with the pain of loss and disappointment and grief beating through her body with every step she took. As she walked, the tears she had been trying so hard to hold in finally broke free. At first she tried to wipe them away, but it was no use. She just kept walking, leaving Rio alone in the darkness. </span>

<p> </p><p>
<span>The following three days after Agatha finally snapping at Rio go by in a blur. Agatha doesn’t leave the house. She doesn’t show up to rehearsals. She lets all calls go to voicemail and doesn’t ever get around to listening to them. She should be at rehearsals, everyone else would be, but she simply couldn’t be around them all, around Rio. Not until she got this song done. So, she spends the three days sitting on her couch, at her dining table, pacing, in her bedroom, trying to think of anything to get down on a piece of paper. But everytime she tries to write, the pen hovers over the paper, refusing to move. Her thoughts are consumed by Rio, and she hates it more than ever. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She was doing fine, until Rio showed up. She had a band, she was able to write songs, and in her free time she got to enjoy bickering with her bandmates. She doesn’t even see the fun in being mean to Jen anymore. Rio has truly ruined her, for the second time around. Her dumb smirk and her pretty, brown, knowing eyes. It’s all Agatha can see. When she looks down at the paper, all she can see is Rio staring back at her. When she closes her eyes, it’s Rio. Rio now, her face beautiful, and lived in; changed ever so slightly. Rio then, her features softer and younger, with her heart always on her sleeve. Rio who chose another band over their own. Rio who didn’t even put up a fight when Agatha told her it was over. Rio who Agatha loves so deeply. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>Loved. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She meant to think </span>
<em>
<span>loved.</span>
</em>
<span> Past tense. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Everything always seems to be in the past tense. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha feels like she is slowly losing her mind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And that’s when Billy shows up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>He knocks at the door rhythmically, and that’s how she immediately knows it’s him before even looking through the peephole. It’s too joyous to be anyone else. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Still, she goes over to the door, looking through the peephole and sees Billy’s face, looking determined outside of the door. Agatha sighs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha? I know you’re in there?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha debates not answering, but she knows that the teenager is stupid enough to stand outside all day if he needed to. She leans her forehead against the cold wood of the door. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Go away, Billy,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>His eyes widen, not expecting to hear Agatha so close on the other side of the door, before he straightens up again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not leaving until I can speak to you. You may as well open the door,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not in the mood for company,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hears Billy sigh, as she looks into the hole again and sees him cross his arms. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine,” he responds. As much as Agatha knows his stubbornness, Billy knows hers. “I’ll just say what I came to say out here,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolls her eyes, holding in a groan. Billy clears his throat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You can be the most frustrating, obnoxious, manipulative person I have ever met,” he starts. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha can’t help but breathe out a laugh, completely shocked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Damn kid, came all this way to tell me how much you </span>
<em>
<span>adore </span>
</em>
<span>me?” She questions, her voice dripping with sarcasm. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m serious, Agatha,” Billy continues, and without even looking, Agatha can picture his brows furrowing with a mix of naive loyalty and frustration, “you push people away, and you put your entire soul into your songs, and you act like you care about nothing else. About </span>
<em>
<span>nobody</span>
</em>
<span> else. But that’s all it is…an act,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stares at the ground, heaving out a sigh. Then she closes her eyes, and twists the doorknob, opening the door. Billy clearly doesn’t expect it, as he falters for a second, before taking in the sight of Agatha with her long hair somehow even messier and tangled than usual, in a blue flannel compared to her usual beautiful coats and shirts. Billy doesn’t say anything about her dishevelled appearance, a smart choice on his end. He recovers quickly though, standing up taller with an attempt to appear more professional. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Go on then,” Agatha simply says, leaning against the doorframe, trying to look unimpressed, “got anything else to say besides that I’m an acting bitch?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy sighs, “stop doing this Agatha. You act like Rio’s the one running away, but to me it seems a lot more like </span>
<em>
<span>you </span>
</em>
<span>are. You don’t need to write this dumb song. We just want you. Agatha Harkness, our bandmate, not whoever else you’re trying to be,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn’t respond, just stares at him. She tells herself it’s because she wants to see what he says next, but in truth, she’s scared that if she opens her mouth she’ll fall apart. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know Rio being here freaks you out. I’ve listened to some of your old stuff, </span>
<em>
<span>Scratch</span>
</em>
<span>. You guys were good, and then I guess you just…disappeared. I don’t want that to happen to us. We need you, Agatha. Like it or not, you’re kinda the soul of this thing. Though, don’t tell Jen I said that, she might hit me,” he pauses, his voice softening, “you make the music mean something, Agatha. It would all just be random tunes and empty performances. You turn songs into legends.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>His fingers fall to their sides, drumming against his thigh, as if itching to play his guitar, or simply run away from this encounter. Agatha looks him up and down, calculating. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“And for what it’s worth, Rio was the one who told me to come over here. I think she would’ve done it herself, but she didn’t think you wanted to see her. It’s not my place, but she cares about you Agatha. We all do. And it’d be really great if you could come back to rehearsals. We won’t be even close to ready for our performance if you aren’t there. I think you owe us…her, and yourself, a second chance,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A silence falls over them. Again, Agatha doesn’t speak. Billy finally nods, understanding that he isn’t getting a response. He reaches into his pocket, pulling out a small piece of paper. He wordlessly puts his hand out in a fist, waiting until Agatha relents and puts her palm out. The paper is placed carefully onto it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s all I gotta say. Do what you want with it. I hope to maybe see you tomorrow morning, song or no song,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy turns away, and Agatha watches him as he leaves. She swallows hard, her jaw clenched as she shuts the door and steps back inside. She puts her head back against the door, breathing deeply. She remains there for a while, Billy’s words echoing in her head. She looks down at the paper in her hand, before unfolding it. She stares at the words written in Billy’s handwriting, breathing in deeply. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span> Then, before she even realises what she’s doing, Agatha is putting on the nearest coat and grabbing her keys. She doesn’t let her brain keep up with her body, as she pushes herself out of her apartment, with one destination in mind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stands in front of the building. The address, the same as the one written on the note Billy gave her. She shivers. She isn’t sure whether it’s from the cold or not. She hesitates, staring at a building she’s never been to before. Somewhere where Rio has made a life for herself sometime in the last eight years. A life without Agatha. Agatha breathes deeply. She wants to turn around and run away, but before she has the chance to, the front door opens, and Rio’s head peaks around the corner. Her eyebrows are furrowed, as she takes in the sight of Agatha, a long coat over her flannel, standing in the middle of the street and staring up at the house. </span>
</p><p>
<span>After a second of coming to terms with the sight, Rio stands up straighter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hello, Agatha,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had thought of many things on her way over, solutions to most problems. However, she never considered that Rio might catch her creepily loitering outside of her house like someone from a movie. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clears her throat. She instinctively wants to fling her hair over her shoulder, or roll her eyes and make an entrance. But she just can’t find it in herself to do so. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” she simply says, voice softer than it has been in what feels like years, “hi.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilts her head, eyes raking up and down Agatha’s dishevelled figure. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Feeling uncomfortable in being assessed like that, Agatha speaks again, “I was uh, in the neighbourhood,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raises an eyebrow, the corner of her mouth twitching in that maddeningly familiar way. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You were in the neighbourhood?” she questions, voice just bordering teasing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighs, the tension in her body relaxing with the familiarity of being annoyed by this woman. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can I just… come inside?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Without hesitation, Rio steps to the side, holding the door open for Agatha and allowing her entry. Agatha nods, before making her way into the house. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As she enters, she glances around. It’s immediately strange, being here. Rio’s style hasn’t changed in the past decade. Some of the furniture Agatha recognises as pieces Rio had kept in the apartment they shared all those years ago. Her home is lived in, and comfortable, covered in plants and the forest greens that Rio has always loved. Agatha continues walking, ending up in the lounge room. She doesn’t bother to ask or wait, she just sits down on the couch. Rio follows after her. Agatha can tell she’s trying to act casual, but there’s still a visible tension in Rio’s stance that Agatha can recognise. She watches her as Rio pauses, before sitting down on the arm of the couch, rather than the cushion. Agatha can’t help but notice that in doing so she left quite a distance between the two of them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They both fall into silence. It’s neither comfortable or uncomfortable, it just is. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio breaks the silence first. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you doing here, Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha exhales slowly, her fingers running along the seam of the couch cushion. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Honestly?” She pauses, “I don’t know,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilts her head, her eyes boring into Agatha, as if trying to analyse a specimen. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who could have imagined, Agatha Harkness, without a plan,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha offers a half smile, not sure what to say in response to that. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>It’s true, she doesn’t have a plan. She did on the way over, but now that she’s inside, with Rio sitting there, watching her, it’s like she is left defenceless on her own. That feeling seemed to be a constant for her in the past few weeks. She had no plans, or if she did, they fell apart so quickly. It terrifies her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not here to apologise, though,” Agatha states. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio raises an eyebrow, the corners of her mouth twitch upward. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course not, I </span>
<em>
<span>do </span>
</em>
<span>know you, Agatha. You could kill a man and still wouldn’t admit you were in the wrong,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“He probably deserved it,” Agatha responds, without missing a beat. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, he probably did,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilts her head, and her expression is so soft and so genuine that it forces Agatha to tear her eyes away. She swallows, eyes glancing around the room once more. Her eyes land on a familiar sight, in the edge of the room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I used to hate that lamp,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She doesn’t turn to face Rio, but she can still hear the quiet sound of her breathing out a laugh, “yeah, I know,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You always tried to put it in ridiculous places, just to annoy me,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What can I say? I love the dramatics of it all,” Rio pauses, and Agatha turns back to face her, “I kind of have always hated it too,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why keep it then?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugs, pauses, and then looks right into Agatha’s eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know,” she says softly, repeating what Agatha said earlier. She smiles, not a smirk like usual, but a gentle smile, of a mixture of sadness and affection. It’s the type of expression that makes Agatha want to do something that she’ll regret, </span>
<em>
<span>again</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The expression disappears just as quickly as it came, as Rio’s smile gets replaced with her smirk once more. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You only hated that lamp because I refused to throw it away. Couldn’t handle not having everything be perfect,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolls her eyes, tilting her head back. She ignores the possible deeper meaning of the sentiment. Instead, just attempting to make herself not feel like shit, despite kind of looking like it right now. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I hated that lamp because it’s genuinely hideous,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>At this, Rio laughs audibly, shaking her head. Without even realising it, Agatha smiles at the sound. Rio’s smile slowly fades, as she turns to look at the lamp. Agatha’s eyes remain on her side profile, watching as Rio contemplates. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Guess I’m just bad at moving on,” she explains, almost in a whisper.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s chest tightens, her fingers pausing their subconscious movements. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She exhales slowly, finding the air harder to breathe than just moments before. She looks away, biting at her lip.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s not always a bad thing,” she responds, trying to sound self-assured, but it still comes out weak. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighs, then speaks suddenly, “I haven’t been honest with you about why I auditioned,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turns her head back around, suddenly curious. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I keep telling you that it’s because I like drumming, and it’s a good band. And those are both true-” she pauses, before reconsidering her sentence. “I haven’t played the drums in around seven years,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyebrows furrow, and after a second, she lets out a harsh laugh. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The prodigy drummer who can’t go five minutes without drumming a beat onto the nearest object, not drumming for 7 years? Don’t fuck with me Rio,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio just looks at her, expression unchanging. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha completely freezes, blood running cold. Her laughter stops abruptly, her heart suddenly pounding so hard in her chest that she swears Rio can hear it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“So what? You just gave up?” Agatha replies, tilting her head slightly in an attempt to not appear completely invested in the answer. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m good at it. No, I’m great at it. But I… I couldn’t do it without you. I tried with the Salem Seven, after Scratch. But they were always at each other's throats, and it slowly just came to an end. But even during that time, it felt like…like I was playing someone who I’m not.” She crosses and uncrosses her legs, avoiding Agatha’s eyes,  “I didn’t…I’ve never loved music, Agatha. But…I did love you, and,” she shrugs, “they sort of became one and the same,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mind raced with memories of her and Rio in their old, dingy rehearsal studios, of all the times Rio came to hang out with her in the record store, of them blasting music as they moved all their furniture into their first apartment, and of watching Rio perform. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“So what?” Agatha starts, clearing her throat when the words come out with minor cracks, “you give up, establish a real life and drop it all just to come perform with us?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought maybe things would be different this time,” Rio trails off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“But they aren’t,” Agatha concludes, voice quiet. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nods slowly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not going to apologise either, Agatha. Not for the past, not for showing up again. We both made mistakes,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugs. She wants to argue, to refuse that she made any error, and defend her honour, but the words don’t come. She doesn’t like thinking about being in the wrong, and she doesn’t like thinking about the past. Even with how present it’s been in her memory since Rio’s return, it still hurts her. </span>
<em>
<span>But she pushed Rio away too. </span>
</em>
<span>Just like Billy said she’s doing now. History has a funny way of replicating itself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“If you don’t want to see my face ever again…I’ll leave,” Rio finally says. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes widen. If she had asked last week, Agatha would have taken the opportunity immediately. There was too much complexity, too much history. But now? Now it feels like there’s a sudden pit in her stomach. Her breath catches, and her fingers tense against the leather beneath her. She opens her mouth, and then closes it again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t you live here?” Agatha finally says, taking the easy way out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio squints at her slightly, before tilting her head. Her gaze is piercing, a mixture of sadness and frustration. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sees the expression, and sighs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“The band needs a drummer,” she settles on, but then she can’t help but continue, “the band needs you.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s frustration fades, and she smiles softly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“They need you too, Agatha. The </span>
<em>
<span>real</span>
</em>
<span> you,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The words hang there for a moment, and Agatha suddenly feels the need to stand up and stretch her legs. But she doesn’t. She just sits there. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know who that is anymore,” she whispers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s gaze softens. She adjusts her position, so that she falls somehow gracefully onto the couch cushion beside Agatha, rather than the chair arm. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, let me see. I think I used to know Agatha Harkness quite well. Agatha Harkness is stubborn, she is incredibly frustrating, she’s dramatic,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you and Billy teaming up on me because he started insulting me to compliment me earlier too,” Agatha cuts in, and Rio just rolls her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“But, Agatha Harkness is brilliant, and dangerous, and powerful in every possible situation, and she never runs away from a challenge. So, I challenge you to just…relax, just for this performance. Show them all the real Agatha, because I think she’s pretty cool…although she is still definitely infuriating,” Rio concludes. She then slowly reaches her hand out, brushing a strand of hair away from Agatha’s face. Agatha doesn’t even notice the way she almost leans in to the almost-touch. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why are you still always helping me, Rio? I’ve been a bitch,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah well, I can deal with a bitch. I don’t think I could deal with losing you again,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The casual vulnerability of the words hit Agatha like a truck, sucking the breath out of her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t need saving. I would’ve worked this out on my own,” Agatha explains, and Rio lifts an eyebrow. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure Agatha, that’s why you showed up outside my door and started being willing to actually talk about your feelings for once instead of acting like everything is fine and perfect,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I hate you,” Agatha responds. As soon as the words come out of her mouth, though lighthearted, she still feels a slight amount of guilt. A rare feeling for Agatha Harkness. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio seems to sense it, because she just knocks her shoulder against Agatha’s. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure you do, Agatha,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The next day, Agatha shows up to rehearsal. And she doesn’t just show up, but she is in fact there…</span>
<em>
<span> early</span>
</em>
<span>. Earlier than everyone else. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When Billy shows up, he immediately locks eyes with Agatha, earning a bright smile on his face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t look so happy teenager, I came here on my own accord, not because of what you said,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy’s face turns faux-professional, as he gives a salute and goes to setting up his guitar. They both know she’s lying, and they both are more than okay at leaving it at that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When Jen and Alice show up together, they pause and stare in shock at the sight of Agatha already set up, twisting the microphone cable in her fingers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, you’re-,” Alice starts</span>
</p><p>
<span>“not dead?” Jen finishes, earning a jab in her torso from Alice. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not dead, sorry to say Jen. Let’s hope your performance doesn’t bore me to death today,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Jen sends a glare in Agatha’s direction, and Billy has to quickly jump into the rescue. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s joking! She’s going to be </span>
<em>
<span>normal </span>
</em>
<span>today, right Agatha?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha just rolls her eyes, waving her hand in bored agreement. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Then, Rio shows up. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The room falls silent as the door opens. Agatha immediately notices the shift in the other three, and feels the need to roll her eyes again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t tell me you’re all waiting for some big moment. It’s just Rio, nothing special,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nothing special?” Rio questions, as she strolls in, her typical smirk already on her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re late, no need to draw more attention to your entrance,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, I don't think I’ve ever seen you on time,” Alice points out. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That is irrelevant,” Agatha argues, “come on, time to get started,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The others all move toward their instruments, finishing up their tuning and preparation for rehearsal, when Jen speaks.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey Agatha, did you finish writing that song?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha freezes, and she immediately feels both Billy and Rio’s eyes turn toward her. She doesn’t know what to say. She’s spent so long on it and ended up with nothing, that there’s this sudden, unfamiliar flare of embarrassment and disappointment. But she swallows it down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We don’t need a new song,” Billy cuts in, sending Jen a pointed look as if to say </span>
<em>
<span>we’ll talk later</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I mean if we do need one, I’ve always said Agatha wrote her best song back-,” Rio starts, but Agatha’s eyes immediately widen and she turns her entire body around to face Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No. I’ve told you. That song is...it’s irrelevant now. That was too long ago,”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio doesn’t nod or shake her head, she just looks back, expressionless. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha heaves a sigh of relief, and then turns back around to face Jen. She takes a deep breath.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I haven’t got a song for you. I’ve tried too many times to count, and haven’t got anything. If you have a problem with that, then you can try yourself,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>There’s a moment of silence, before Jen nods. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ll survive,” she responds. And despite their constant bickering, the way Jen says those two words are spoken with such meaning that it almost makes Agatha feel grateful for her. </span>
<em>
<span>Almost. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“Two more rehearsals until the big performance. Let’s get started guys!” Alice exclaims, excitedly stretching her fingers over the piano. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looks around the room, feeling a sense of pride she hasn’t felt in a long while. As her gaze meets Rio’s, they share an understanding look. Things will go better this time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The next few days go by in a blur. It doesn’t start out perfect, but after time and effort, they get it pretty close. Lilia comes by, and nods in approval, probably one of the most positive ways she expresses her feelings towards their performance. Agatha acts nonchalant about it, but inside, she beams. By their final rehearsal, it feels as if everyone is on the same wavelength for the first time. Agatha can just tilt her head slightly when something sounds off, and Billy will already be fixing his tuning. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha doesn’t let the specifics of the music bog her down. It’s hard to get out of the mindset, but whenever she feels something a bit too specific and a bit too cruel coming along, her eyes instinctively find Rio’s, as if Rio already knew what Agatha was going to say before the words left her mouth. Agatha takes a breath, and thinks of how to fix it in kinder words (as kind as Agatha can say), or decides if it's bad enough to even need fixing. And it seems to work well. No one has yelled at her yet. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>And it’s working. Everything seems to be falling into place. And by the end of their final rehearsal before the show, Agatha finds herself </span>
<em>
<span>smiling</span>
</em>
<span>. Truly </span>
<em>
<span>smiling</span>
</em>
<span>. She tries to cover it up before anyone points it out, but she knows everyone saw it. And for once, she doesn’t seem to care as much. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>***</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Now, it’s the day. The day they’ve been preparing for for weeks, months if you include pre-Rio. Agatha isn’t nervous.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Okay, she is. </span>
</p><p>
<span>But really, Agatha is kind of…constantly nervous. She just doesn’t let anyone else see it. Except somehow, one person always does. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As they stand backstage, Billy moves his fingers on an air guitar, practicing exactly where his positioning should be. Alice paces back and forth, cracking her knuckles and her neck, Jen sits down in the corner, trying to </span>
<em>
<span>cleanse</span>
</em>
<span> herself or something. Agatha stands, casually leaning against a wall, picking at her fingernails. She feels Rio’s eyes on her constantly, but she doesn’t give her the satisfaction of looking up. Instead, Rio is forced to stand up from her chair and wander over to Agatha herself, bumping her shoulder as she sidles up next to her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nervous?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugs, eyes still on her fingertips, “not really,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiles, “liar,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turns to her, rolling her eyes, but she doesn’t try to debate it. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You actually showed up this time, at least,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shakes her head, but the smirk is still present. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re never going to let me move on from that, are you?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I mean, it did cause eight years of negative emotions and the inability to open myself up to anyone,” Agatha argues.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lets out a low whistle, “Agatha Harkness, talking about her feelings in an open space. I never thought I’d see the day,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha just sends a half hearted scowl in her direction.   </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span> “Aren’t you? Nervous, I mean?” Agatha questions. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Terrified,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The tone is too teasing to be real, and so Agatha gently shoves her in the side, knowing that Rio is just being sarcastic.  </span>
</p><p>
<span>“How are you always so calm at these things? I’m not </span>
<em>
<span>anxious</span>
</em>
<span>, but I’m human,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shrugs, “we’re sort of walking a road that doesn’t really exist. What happens, happens. There are some things you can’t do in life, and changing your fate is number one,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know I don’t believe in fate. Are children fated to die early? Was Scratch fated to fail from the start?”</span>
</p><p>
<span> Agatha feels the internal nerves easing slightly just from the familiar presence of Rio being by her side while they wait to perform. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t think Scratch was ever a failure, Agatha,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffs, “So you choosing another band, and me getting addicted to perfection wasn’t a failure?”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tilts her head, looking into Agatha’s blue eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t think something so intertwined with my love for you could ever be a failure,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha feels as if her heart pauses for a moment, as she almost chokes on her saliva. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Coven of Chaos, you’re on in ten, is everyone here?”   </span>
</p><p>
<span>Still too shocked by Rio’s choice of words, Agatha quickly turns her attention to the stage manager, answering him with a yes. </span>
</p><p>
<span>When she turns back around to Rio, her own words don’t seem to have phased Rio, as she taps away against her thighs. Agatha doesn’t know what to say, so she doesn’t say anything at all. </span>
</p><p>
<span>They sit like that, backstage, comfortable and waiting. At one point, Rio gets up to whisper something in Alice’s ear, who nods and pats Rio once on the arm. Agatha furrows her eyebrows, confused, but she doesn’t think about it too deeply. She’s glad that Rio is beginning to find a place in the band, not just with Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy gives everyone a pep talk, which for once, no one groans at, and Agatha thinks that shows exactly just how important this day is for them. Agatha practices some of her vocal runs, as Rio and Alice do some stretching and jumps on the spot, preparing themselves completely. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And before they know it, their name is being announced over the loudspeaker, and Agatha is being ushered on stage, the band following behind her.   </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The crowd all cheer as they enter, one of the biggest crowds any of them have ever played in front of. The energy is pure electric, buzzing with an energy that feels unreal. The other acts beforehand did a brilliant job at entertaining the crowd, and Agatha can just tell, that they’re all ready to watch a performance of a lifetime. Her heart pounds in her ears, but as soon as she grabs onto the microphone stand in the front of the stage, the nerves simply fade away. Agatha turns to check on her band, making direct eye contact with each of them. Billy’s face is full of nerves, his fingers itching on his guitar, but when Agatha nods at him, his posture straightens and his chin rises. Jen’s gaze is full of determination, there’s no running away now. Alice offers up a soft smile, before turning her gaze down to the keyboard in front of her. And Rio, Rio sits there, twirling her drumstick as she watches Agatha. It doesn’t just feel like she’s watching for Agatha’s lead, but as if she were watching </span>
<em>
<span>her, </span>
</em>
<span>intently, and interested. It sends a slight shiver down Agatha’s spine. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turns back to the crowd, a smile appearing brightly on her face. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you all ready for this?” She exclaims, and the crowd burst into cheers. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She clears her thoughts, as she focuses on what’s right in front of her. The performance of a lifetime. She turns back to Rio, one more time, before sending a nod in her direction. Rio smiles in response, before counting them in. This is it. Here goes nothing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The crowd love them, and the effort all of the band are putting into their performance is next level. Agatha sings as if her life depends on it, trying to feel each and every emotion she felt when writing all of these individual songs she’s been playing for years. In every lyrical break, she catches her breath, turning to face her bandmates, her </span>
<em>
<span>coven</span>
</em>
<span>, watching as each of them give it their all. It’s all Agatha could have ever imagined. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It doesn’t take long for Agatha to feel her hair sticking to her forehead, but she doesn’t care. The crowd, the band, everything is too exhilarating. Agatha has never felt anything like it before, at least not in a long time. Not since-</span>
</p><p>
<span>She looks at Rio in her peripheral vision, the woman hitting the drumset with such precision that no one could ever assume she hadn’t performed in years. Agatha remembers their first performance together. They were teenagers, and were doing a free gig at a nearby bar. There were about five people in the audience, but it still somehow felt like they were on top of the world. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had begun to doubt if she’d ever get that feeling again. But here, now? It felt as real as ever before. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>They perform all of their songs that Agatha had prepared, and as their final song begins to conclude, Agatha is truly breathless. Her face is red, but her smile is bright and shining. As the final chords trail off, the crowd cheers, jumping up and down and waving their arms. Agatha turns to face her band members, but most of them are already looking at one another. Agatha doesn’t question it, just turns back around to the audience and pulls the microphone close to her mouth. She’s just about to thank them all for their time, before she’s cut off by the sound of another voice on a nearby mic. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha immediately spins around, turning to see Rio, microphone in hand, standing from her drumset. Agatha’s jaw falls open, unable to tear her eyes away from whatever the fuck Rio is doing. This was not planned for. Agatha has no idea what’s going on. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We have one last song for you folks tonight, is that okay with you?” Rio asks into the microphone, and the crowd cheer in excitement. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>Agatha suddenly can feel her heart racing again, as Rio meets her eyes, shining with mischief as she shrugs her shoulders. Agatha turns to look at her other band mates, waiting to see her own confusion reflected back in their expression, but they all are already preparing. They all know what’s going on. Agatha has been completely blindsided.     </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha stutters, turning her gaze back to Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Trust me,” Rio mouths, but Agatha has never felt so confused, so vulnerable before. It reminds her of that night all those years ago, completely blindsided by Rio’s disappearance. She has no other song prepared. She would have had one written, but she gave up on that one. </span>
<em>
<span>Everyone </span>
</em>
<span>told her to give up on it. So what the fuck is going on?</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>And that’s when she hears the opening notes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She completely freezes, her hand tightening on the microphone. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>She knows the notes. She had prepared them for months, thinking of the perfect lyrics to pair with them, back when she was a teenager. But it was never good enough, not to her. Rio, however, had always loved the song. But Agatha had told her no. She wasn’t going to-</span>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t walk away now. She wouldn’t be the one to ruin this all for them, not this time. She curses Rio under her breath, before bringing the microphone to her face, trying not to let her hands shake. Could she even remember the lyrics? </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Of course she could, </span>
</em>
<span>she somehow remembered the lyrics every damn time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>And then, she sings. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have learned the lesson, of all that’s foul and fair,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>The crowd quiets slightly, no one recognising the lyrics. Agatha feels awful, seeing all their slight swaying and their moveless mouths. She was going to throttle Rio after this. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Our love was forged in fire, water, earth and air. The spell is cast, how long it lasts, I can not divine. The road is there, and so I dare, to risk this heart of mine,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closes her eyes, trying to focus on the moment, rather than her brain slowly being filled with insecurities and annoyance. She sucks in a breath, ready to go into the chorus. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Down, down, down the road, down the Witches Road,”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>What she doesn’t expect, however, is for there to suddenly be other voices on the microphones. She didn’t even realise they had </span>
<em>
<span>access</span>
</em>
<span> to more microphones. But before she has time to comprehend it, the entire band is joining in on the chorus. Agatha’s eyes snap open, turning to look at her band, all focused but smiling back at her. Agatha doesn’t know what to think. She turns back to the audience, expecting bored, unenthused faces, but she is instead met with the faces of growing interest, getting into the music. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turns to Rio, who lifts an eyebrow, focused on Agatha more so than the drums or the lyrics she’s joining in on.  Agatha takes a breath, and then she lets herself go. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As they continue further into the song, Agatha can’t help but let a huge smile break out on her face, watching the audience attempt to join in on the chorus, all bouncing and dancing to the little old song she wrote as a teenager. And the band singing all at once, is something Agatha never would have expected, but somehow it brings it all together. Yes, this was her song, yes this began as her band, but neither is true anymore. This is all thanks to her coven. Their band.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As they break into the bridge, the band are more energised than ever before. Alice stands from her piano stool, playing with all her might. Jen and Billy share looks of intense appreciation and joy, and Agatha’s eyes find Rio’s. They remain there for the rest of the song, brown eyes staring back at her, such a genuinity that Agatha had rarely seen in the past decade. It feels as if everything else falls away. Just her, and Rio, back in Rio’s teenage bedroom, dancing around at the low quality recording of their duo attempt at the original ‘Ballad of the Witches Road’. Since then, the lyrics went through a few changes, but it still feels the same. Agatha looks at her, her dark hair stuck to the corners of her face from the sweat of the lights and the performance, the way her eyes flicker with a mixture of mischief and adoration. All of the years of distrust and hurt and anger, seem to fade away in that moment. Agatha spent so long trying to hate the only person who ever meant something to her, and she isn’t going to do that again. If she can fix her band, she can fix this.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As the song reaches its crescendo, Agatha finally tears her eyes away from Rio, not even noticing until she looks away that tiny tears had pooled in the edges of her eyes. She looks into the audience, every single face more overjoyed than she’d ever seen an audience before. In those final lines, the entire band gives it their all. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll see you at the end!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Silence. </span>
</p><p>
<span>All Agatha can hear is her own heartbeat, racing in her chest, and her breath heavy and fast. If Agatha could catch her breath in time, she’d be holding it. But before she gets the chance, the crowd erupts, the cheers feel as if they’re vibrating the stage beneath her feet. She stares at them, in complete awe over their genuine excitement, her grin widening. She turns around to look at her band, all of them also looking out into the audience, the same expression as Agatha. Rio’s eyes are the first to return to Agatha. She offers her a lopsided grin, still twisting a drumstick in her hand. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha simply can’t take it anymore. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Without missing a beat, she marches over to where Rio’s sat at her drums. Her face returns to neutrality, causing Rio’s face to fall suddenly, surprise and a slight bit of fear appearing on her features. Rio goes to speak, but before she has the chance, Agatha is gripping the front of her shirt, pulling her up from the stool and immediately closing the distance between them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The kiss feels exactly like the performance did. Completely electric. </span>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment, it is as if the cheering and the lights all fade away, leaving the two of them remaining in Rio’s bedroom, in their apartment, in the rehearsal room, out in that dreaded alleyway, and here, now, on the stage in front of all these people, all at once. When Agatha pulls away, even more breathless than before, she touches Rio’s forehead to her own, fingers still clutching the dummer’s shirt. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I want to make this work, this time,” Agatha whispers, and Rio fucking smiles. Her usual smirk is replaced with this bright, beautiful smile, filled with affection, surprise, and just an ounce of cockiness. Agatha just has to kiss that dumb, big, beautiful smile off of her face one more time. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Jesus, you two, get a room!” Alice calls out, and Rio and Agatha finally pull apart, remembering where they are. Agatha feels a slight blush rise on her cheeks and neck, but as she turns to face Jen, Alice, and Billy, they’re all smiling back at the two of them. Rio grabs onto Agatha’s hand, pulling her forward to centre stage. The others follow suit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The crowd roars, if Agatha closed her eyes, she could imagine it being a vastly larger amount of people, given how loud they all are. There’s whistling and cheering and applauding, and Rio’s hand is clutched in Agatha’s own. It all feels surreal. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Looking between her bandmates, Agatha offers them a soft smile, before leading them into a bow. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>With a laugh and a nudge, the five of them all run off stage, exhilarated, sweating and red faced, but laughing and cheering all the same. The stage manager looks at them, giving Billy a high five as he passes by, and before they know it, Lilia is rushing side stage, face bright with joy. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“That was amazing! You all were-, you-,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nudges Agatha in the ribs, smirking at Lilia’s lack of words.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What </span>
<em>
<span>was </span>
</em>
<span>that song?” Lilia questions, and all eyes turn to Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She clears her throat, suddenly feeling more pressure now than she did up on that stage. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh,” Rio squeezes her hand, and it makes Agatha stand up a little taller, “The Ballad of the Witches Road,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia nods, pulling out a pen and writing it down. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You all are coming into the studio on Monday. We are </span>
<em>
<span>releasing </span>
</em>
<span>that song immediately. The crowd loved it!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes widen, as she glances around at her bandmates, all nodding enthusiastically at her with various levels of excitement and adrenaline rushing through their veins. Rio grips Agatha’s hand tighter, leaning in close to her ear. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I told you, that song was always meant to be heard,” she whispers, the mischief still clear in her tone. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolls her eyes, before exhaling deeply. Feelings of shock, fear, relief, and excitement are all flowing through her at once. She lifts her gaze to meet Lilia’s, before nodding once. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ll get right on it,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia beams, “brilliant! You all did an amazing job, celebrate tonight. I’ll see you on Monday,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as Lilia has walked a few feet away, before anyone can realise what’s happening, Billy is pulling them all into a sweaty, kind of gross, group hug. Normally Jen would be exclaiming and running away in an attempt to cleanse herself from the feeling, but even she lets it happen, so Agatha decides not to push it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>As the group hug breaks apart, and the others begin to talk excitedly about where they should be going to celebrate, Rio reaches out and brushes a strand of hair away from Agatha’s sweaty face. </span>
<span>
<br/>
</span>
<span>“You looked beautiful up there,” Rio almost whispers, finger running its way along Agatha’s cheek and jaw. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hums in approval, and Agatha withholds the urge to kiss her again. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going to say this once, and never again,” Agatha explains, and Rio raises an eyebrow. Agatha leans in close, her mouth just an inch away from Rio’s. Rio’s eyes flick between Agatha’s blue eyes and her lips. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you,” Agatha whispers, before immediately pulling away before Rio can make any contact. Rio’s mouth falls open, as she grabs onto Agatha’s arm and loops it around her own. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“A thank you from Miss Harkness herself. What next, do I get a ‘you were right’?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shoves Rio’s side, scoffing, “don’t push it,”  </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s smirk deepens, and before Agatha has a chance to think, Rio’s hand is back on her jaw, pulling her in close to press an ever so gentle kiss on her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You sure you want to do this?” Rio whispers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiles, “the band, us, the music…I want to do it all. Right this time,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No more running away,” Rio continues. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No more pushing,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“No more putting music between us,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Deal,” Agatha responds. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lingers, their foreheads touching once more. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Deal,” she echoes. A promise, from both of them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, Jen’s voice cuts through the other noises. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on love birds, time to get wasted!” she exclaims, but as soon as Billy’s face breaks into a smile, she immediately turns to him, “and juice for the teenager,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Billy scowls, but it disappears pretty quickly once the sound of laughter from the other’s sounds in the backstage area.   </span>
</p><p>
<span>The stage manager hears this, and turns to look over his shoulder, “hey, you guys were great and all but we still have two more acts…so if you could just…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, yeah, we’re leaving,” Agatha responds, and the others all grin at her as they head for the exit. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lets herself relax for a little bit. No longer feeling the tension of expectations and power. Maybe Billy was right, she really can just be herself. That’s who wrote The Ballad. That’s the woman who fell in love with Rio. That’s the one who fell in love with music in the first place. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As they walk along the streets towards their destination, Rio turns to Agatha, eyes squinting. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re thinking,” Rio points out, flicking the side of Agatha’s face. Agatha sends her a half-hearted cold stare in response. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“One of us has to,” </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, but what are you thinking about?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ponders on the question for a moment. </span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The future?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The past?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The band?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Them?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Herself?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>She can’t think of a definitive answer, so instead she shrugs. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nothing important enough right now,”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiles, before nodding slowly. She gives Agatha a quick kiss on the cheek. Agatha can’t help but let out a laugh at the feeling. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You know, if you keep smiling like that, people might think Agatha Harkness has a heart,” Rio teases. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes widen in faux-shock, “Who? Moi?” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Before Rio gets the chance to respond, however, Alice raises her arms in the air quite a bit ahead of them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey slowpokes! Last one there, has to buy the first round!” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio and Agatha look between one another, before they both immediately break into a run, every man for himself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>As they run to catch up, smiling and laughing in the cold, their other band members marching ahead, Agatha thinks  that if Rio is possibly right about fate, then maybe, just maybe, she can agree for once. Because this moment feels like exactly where she was always destined to end up.</span>
