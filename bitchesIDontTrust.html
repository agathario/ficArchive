    <blockquote>
     <p>
      "Do you want to make it up to me, Riley?"
     </p>
     <p>
      Another nod, more enthusiastic this time. Eve's smile only grew, and Riley could've cried with relief as she reached up and pulled her into a kiss. Her hands instinctually raised to cradle Eve's jaw, slotting herself between Eve's thighs as the kiss grew faster and messier.
     </p>
     <p>
      She trailed a line of kisses down Eve's neck, breathing her in, and reached for the neckline of her shirt before Eve grabbed her hands and stopped her.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Get on your knees."
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      OR, a sort-of AU agathario oneshot!

    bitches i don't trust them (but they give me what i want for the night)
   </h2>

    <p>
     Her shift was dragging out into its' 60th hour by 6 in the evening, and Riley had taken the opportunity the moment it arose to slip into the on-call room and pass out atop the covers of one of the bunk beds. Finally; a moment of peace and quiet where she wasn't bored out of her mind stitching up another person's drunken mishap, or stuck in the conference room filling out the paperwork for one of her many patients. She'd closed her eyes and it'd been the biggest relief she'd felt in years, even more than-
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Riley was shaken out of her peace; literally.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Riley, get up. Your pager ran out; you're needed in room 204." She barely registered who the voice belonged to and instinctually pulled herself up from the bed, nodding her head in acknowledgement and walking out into the hallway.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She made her way down to the treatment rooms for non-serious injuries before stopping in front of 204, grabbing the clipboard hung over the door to skim read it and opening said door.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Inside, she found a woman perched at the edge of the surgical bed, hands clasped almost awkwardly in her lap as she smiled at Riley.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Eve Fletcher?"
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "That's me." She nodded. Riley offered her a smile back and closed the door behind her, taking a seat in front of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "I’m Dr Johnson, but you can call me Riley. So, you're in for... a gash on your leg. Wanna tell me what happened there?"
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'm honestly embarrassed." Eve laughed, running a hand through her hair. "I was just trying to grab a box off the top shelf in my closet. I guess the bottom gave way, and one of my heels fell and cut into my thigh."
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Wow." Riley nodded along, an amused grin on her face. "That is kind of embarrassing, yeah."
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She paused to reach into the bottom cabinet drawer of medical equipment and pull out a stitching kit, leaving it on the tray as she pulled on an accompanying pair of gloves. "Can you show me where the injury is, please?"
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Eve seemed to hesitate for a second, biting down on her bottom lip. She let out a staggered laugh as she bunched her skirt up, revealing a fairly deep gash that just so happened to be in the upper portion of Eve's inner thigh. The skin around it was inflamed and Riley knew it'd need a thick line of stitches, as well as a painkiller prescription for when the injury inevitably started to flare up anytime Eve moved her leg.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Okay. Um, would you be comfortable if I asked you to spread your legs a little more? I'll be able to manoeuvre the needle and thread a little easier that way."
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sure, yeah."
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They shifted so Eve could spread her legs, letting Riley take a seat just within the space so she could clean the wound. "This is gonna sting a little."
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She brushed the anti-septic solution over the gash ever-so slightly, but the sting shot through Eve's thigh like a bullet. She winced loudly and her hand shot out, gripping the first thing in her reach; which just so happened to be Riley's upper arm.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sorry." Eve sighed, her grip loosening but not letting up entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's fine. Honestly, don't worry." Riley laughed, partly to make Eve feel better about the sudden contact. "I need to give you a shot of local anaesthetic too, so you can hold on for as long as you need."
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "You're very kind." She choked out through pained blinks.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Riley uncapped the needle and framed an area of Eve's thigh with her thumb and forefinger, administering the shot and trying her hardest not to indulge in the way Eve's hand tightened around her bicep once again. "Do you have someone to take you home after this? Your leg will be sorta numb for a couple hours after this, so you're not allowed to drive yourself home. It's our policy."
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Shit, no. I drove here myself, I guess I can call somebody."
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "You drove here? With that injury?" Riley's brows raised in surprise. "That must've hurt like hell.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “It was alright. Hurt a little, but nothing too bad.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Riley smiled up at her, pausing before grabbing the stitching kit and scissors to measure out an appropriate stretch of thread.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They fell into a comfortable silence. The anaesthetic worked quickly and Eve simply watched in fascination as Riley stitched up the gash, particularly the deft and precise movement of her fingers as she did so. She kept her free hand at the edge of the bed, steadying herself as she intently kept her focus on sewing up the wound as neatly as possible to avoid scarring.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She did, however, find her eyes trailing off a little - along the smooth expanse of Eve’s upper thigh. Wondering, briefly, what it might feel like under her hand, or even sitting atop her shoulder-
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      No
     </em>
     . Very inappropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Riley cleared her throat as she grabbed the scissors from the tray and snipped the end of the thread off, tying the rest off as she finally finished the stitches.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “How do you feel?” She asked, looking up at Eve and desperately trying not to think about her current position.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Numb.” Eve shrugged. “But better. Thank you, Riley.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The hand on Riley’s arm hadn’t moved the entire time she’d been stitching her up, and she gently squeezed it as she smiled at the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     A beat of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     It felt warm and thick with an unknowing sense in the room, atmosphere clouded with only one thought, and Eve slowly, hesitantly let her hand drift up Riley’s arm to her shoulder. She let it rest at the crook of her neck, her thumb gently pressed to the column of Riley’s throat.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Riley considered it in her head. What was happening right now? Was she… should she?
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Her thoughts raced and raced as she stared up at Eve, a stranger whom she’d met maybe ten minutes ago, and her breath quickened in her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They weren’t sure how long it’d been before Riley surged up from between Eve’s legs; Eve met her in the middle and they connected in a fast, steady kiss. Riley couldn’t help the smile on her face as their lips moved against one another, her hand sliding around Eve’s waist to pull her flush against her stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a complete headrush all at once - Eve felt her heart quicken the moment their lips touched, and her hands were shaky as they slipped around Riley’s neck, anchoring herself there. She let out a moan against Riley’s lips as her tongue brushed over her bottom lip, and her free hand grabbed onto the edge of the bed tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Unfortunately, Eve miscalculated her movements and accidentally knocked her arm straight into the trolley, sending a pair of surgical tongs crashing into the floor with a loud, metallic thud.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They both broke apart at the interruptive sound, Riley walking backwards to put some space between them as Eve covered her face with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh my God, I’m so sorry. I’m sorry, I didn’t-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t’ve- it’s, I shouldn’t’ve done that. I’m so sorry, Eve.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Riley groaned as she rubbed her temples, reaching for the door. “I’ll, um… I’m gonna grab you a nurse, she’ll take over from here, um… yeah, sorry-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She stumbled over her words as Eve stared up at her in equal shock, her face embarrassingly flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     With that, Riley slipped out of the room and somehow managed to coherently ask one of the nurses to finish up. She ran all the way back to the on-call room and flopped onto her back, covering her face with her hands as she barely grasped the reality of the situation she was just in.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     —
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The next time she sees her is toward the end of another gruelling 48 hour shift - she’s paged to non-trauma patient room, and Riley doesn’t even think twice about walking up to the door and pushing her way inside.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     And it’s there that she sees her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Eve.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Riley’s hand hesitated on the doorknob, and she let out a breath she'd apparently been holding in, staring at Eve as she smiled back at her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Doctor.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     There was silence for a moment, before Riley closed the door behind her and let out an awkward laugh, leaning against it. "What, uh... what're you doing here?"
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "My thigh is hurting again. I thought maybe you could take a look at it?"
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Surprised, Riley straightened up and nodded. This was her job, for God's sake. "Oh. Sure, alright, could you lift your skirt up for me a bit?"
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She did, and it revealed the spot where her gash had previously been. The skin was healed almost completely and the stitches had been removed, which brought a confused expression to Riley's face. "Who took the stitches out?"
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Some nurse." Eve tilted her head and leaned back on one hand.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Well, I don't see any signs of infection. What part of the injury is hurting?"
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Eve glanced down at the healed skin, and she smiled up at Riley as she reached over and took Riley's hand. The touch made her breath hitch in her throat, and she simply allowed it as Eve slowly dragged her hand down and placed it atop the spot on her thigh.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Eve, wh-"
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "I thought about you a lot, you know." She interrupted, her other hand grazing up over Riley's arm. "About how you ran off like that; left me in here, all alone."
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Riley gulped with nervousness; her hand didn't move from Eve's thigh. "I'm sorry, it was unprofessional and inappropriate of me-"
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "What was inappropriate was leaving me without finishing what you started." Eve tilted her head slightly, teeth sunk into her bottom lip. "Don't you agree?"
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She nodded, eyes darting down to Eve's lips before meeting her eye again.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Do you want to make it up to me, Riley?"
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Another nod, more enthusiastic this time. Eve's smile only grew, and Riley could've cried with relief as she reached up and pulled her into a kiss. Her hands instinctually raised to cradle Eve's jaw, slotting herself between Eve's thighs as the kiss grew faster and messier.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She trailed a line of kisses down Eve's neck, breathing her in, and reached for the neckline of her shirt before Eve grabbed her hands and stopped her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Get on your knees."
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Riley, not one to disobey, kept her eyes on Eve's as she dropped to her knees in front of her. She lifted her hands up to Eve's thighs, but a hand gripping her jaw forced her to look up at Eve, stopping her movements.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "How long until your shift's over?" She asked, her thumb trailing over Riley's bottom lip as she bunched up her skirt around her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Uh... um, ten minutes, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Alright. Take off my underwear."
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Riley nodded enthusiastically, hooking her fingers into the elastic of her waistband and practically ripping them down Eve's legs. She tossed them behind her and hoisted Eve's thighs up onto her shoulders, hands anchored around them and digging her nails into the flesh for stability. Riley felt lightheaded as she kissed and sucked along Eve's un-injured thigh, leaving a trail of marks that would surely darken within the next few hours, before diving in and dragging her tongue up along Eve's dripping centre.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Eve sighed and craned her neck up to the ceiling, her breath shortening as she buried her hands in Riley's hair. Her hips stuttered against the bed as Riley dipped her tongue inside of her, her nose brushing against Eve's clit in a delicious, teasing motion.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Fuck, just like that." Her voice was strained, barely managing to get her words out through hitched breaths as Riley cleverly alternated between licking and sucking.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She tightened her grip on Riley's hair, letting her hips rut upwards in time with her motions, almost as if she was riding her face.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     It was almost like an out of body experience on Riley's part - she could
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     believe she was on her knees in a treatment room, her head buried between a gorgeous patient's legs who she'd impulsively kissed a week earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She doubled down on her movements, overcome with desire and a need to feel Eve come, to see it, to taste it. Riley adjusted her grip on Eve's thighs, nails biting into her skin as she let herself be used, and she moved up to suck on Eve's clit, drawing tight circles with the tip of her tongue and relishing in the moan it dragged out of Eve's throat.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, f-shit... that's
     <em>
      really
     </em>
     good, Riley."
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     That spurred her on further, and she sighed with pleasure before slipping two fingers into Eve, eliciting an entirely too loud moan from her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Shhh." Riley looked up from between Eve's legs, a shit-eating grin on her face. "Someone could hear us."
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Shut up." She dragged Riley back into her dripping entrance, tugging her hair to a point that toed the line between being painful and pleasurable.
     <em>
      Good.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Eve felt her legs start to shake and her hips moved sloppily and out of pace against Riley, and she let out, "I'm-I'm gonna,
     <em>
      fuck,
     </em>
     gonna come-"
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Riley moved her fingers faster, curling deep inside of Eve as she laved over her clit in a sloppy manner - a tightness in Eve's stomach snapped, and she was forced to cover her own mouth as she came, a high-pitched, whine-like moan muffled under her palm. Her thighs tightened around Riley's head and her hands tugged her hair as her orgasm washed over her in lapping waves.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The room was hot and smelled of sex, and Riley coaxed Eve through her climax as she slowed her fingers down and pressed gentle kisses to the spot just above her clit. Eve, once her thighs stopped violently trembling atop Riley's shoulders, let out a sigh and glanced down at Riley, eyes hooded over.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "So have I made it up to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     That got a half-hearted laugh out of Eve, and she tugged Riley up, pulling her in for a kiss and sliding her hands around her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Definitely."
