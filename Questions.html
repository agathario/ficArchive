<div class="userstuff">
<p>It’s late when a knock on her office door draws Agatha out of her focus and back into the real world. At some point the harsh overhead lights of her office became a substitute for the sun; this, combined with the cramp in her hand from holding her pen, tells her that it’s been too long without a break. </p><p> </p><p>As usual, she’d lost track of time marking this year's end of semester essays, dragged into a timeless void of lacklustre thesis statements backed up by lacklustre evidence thrown together in 12 point Times New Roman. An unavoidable yearly occurrence that always manages to disappoint and drag. </p><p> </p><p>She flicks her eyes towards the clock on the wall opposite her before dragging them back to her paperwork, it tells her it’s way past 8 and office hours had concluded nearly 3 hours ago. Even if they weren’t over, it was an unlikely event one of her students would be coming to see her, it's not that they avoided her, they just kept a wide berth. But the final confirmation that it isn't one of her students, or colleagues or even someone who remotely knows her, comes when the door swings open before she can invite them in.</p><p> </p><p>“Can I help you?” Agatha doesn’t look towards the dark figure she can see standing in the doorway out of the corner of her eye, not when she is too busy circling yet another incorrect use of a semicolon. If students were actually able to use grammar, then maybe she would be able to focus on the lack of content in the essays.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you Dr Harkness?” The figure asks, a touch hesitant. </p><p> </p><p>“That’s what the door says.” Agatha responds dryly pointing to the door with her pen, eyes still focussed on correcting the <em> god awful </em>referencing and suppresses a smirk when the other, assuming, woman sighs. But really, who else did she expect to be sitting in Dr Agatha Harkness’s office marking papers in the evening?</p><p> </p><p>“You’re running some lectures on The Green Witch. I have questions,” The woman says matter of factly, If it wasn’t so direct and to the point Agatha would consider it rude, but she can’t help but respect the obvious lack of interest in buttering Agatha up.</p><p> </p><p>However, the last thing she wants to do right now is to start going through the last 3 years of research because a stranger appears at her door. It’s not that she’s being constantly flooded with questions from her own students and peers, but now she’s been pulled out of her focus, she realises how tired she is and how much she wants to go home. Or just away from the crap these students have plagued her desk with, how they even got into college she would never know.</p><p> </p><p>“There’s a Q&amp;A after my lecture, you can ask them then.” Agatha caps her pen, and puts it harshly down on the desk, hopefully putting an end to the conversation. She looks up, flicking her hair out of the way, and instantly regrets not doing so sooner. </p><p> </p><p>The woman in the door has an air of familiarity about her, that Agatha tries to place but comes up short. She is younger than Agatha, not so young to be an undergrad, and definitely not old enough to be one of her fellow lecturers. Most importantly though, she’s beautiful, beauty that would be depicted in literature and art through the ages. Soft and welcoming features are edged with this otherworldly quality, wide dark eyes looking like they hold the secrets of the universe in the flecks of gold that catch the fluorescent lights overheard. Eyes that could manipulate men to start wars while feign innocence. Hair only a shade lighter than black falls around her shoulders, framing her face, finishing off the darkness that cloaks her from head to toe.</p><p> </p><p>Their eyes lock onto each other, the air growing thicker, tension polluting the space as seconds pass of Agatha waiting for the stranger to say or do something, while the other woman seems content on just looking at her. That is, until she breaks into a grin a predator would give its prey as it slowly approaches before it pounces. It leaves an uneasy feeling in the pit of her stomach that she can’t push to one side, what’s more worrying is that she doesn’t mind it. </p><p> </p><p>“Or, seeing as I’m here, and you’re here, I could just ask them now?” She asks in a playful tone, far from the straight to the point nature of her questions mere seconds ago, as she steps into her office and pulls the door behind her, approaching Agatha’s desk, in a slow feline-like walk. </p><p> </p><p>“I was just about to leave.”</p><p> </p><p>“In that case, why don’t I ask you over drinks?” </p><p> </p><p>“That’s quite the bold move,” Agatha sniffs, feigning disinterest, but the idea of spending time in close proximity with the woman is far too tempting. The magnetism, the draw to her, is so strong, so… <em> confusing </em>, there’s something about her, like she knows her already. </p><p> </p><p>“Was it a successful bold move?”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Yes.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She would only be lying to herself, and the other woman if she said it hadn’t been a successful move, from the second she laid eyes on the stranger, she knew this was only going to end in one way. Agatha hesitates, unable to fight the nagging feeling she knows the woman, curiosity getting the better of her as she refuses to accept the invitation until she finds out who she is.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t date my students.” Agatha leans back in her chair, crossing her arms, a weak attempt of closing herself off. </p><p> </p><p>“I never said <em> date </em>,” she smirks and Agatha feels heat crossing her face at the slip of tongue, “But, I’m not one of your students.”</p><p> </p><p>“If you aren’t one of my students, who are you then?” </p><p> </p><p>“Rio.” </p><p> </p><p>“Alright <em> Rio </em>.” She punctuates it by snapping the lid of her laptop closed, “What do you do?” </p><p> </p><p>“I’m a PhD student, not one from your department…” Rio adds quickly, almost sensing her protest, “Though I think you should be able to recognise someone if they were.” she mumbles.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. “You just look familiar, that’s all.” </p><p> </p><p>“I’m sure I do…” Rio smirks, letting the words hang in the air for a moment, “How about that drink then?”</p><p> </p><p>She’s just the right amount of intrigued and in need of something that isn’t marking papers that she’s tempted to say yes. And, well, the way the woman’s tongue pokes her cheek, a raised brow, with the cocky confidence that makes Agatha want to tear her down and equally jump her bones. </p><p> </p><p>“You have one drink’s worth of questions. Any others can be asked at the end of the lecture.” She stands abruptly, her chair rolls back from her desk as she swipes her bag and coat from the hook behind her in one swift movement, taking command of the situation and startling Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, now?”</p><p> </p><p>“Why? Is now an inconvenience for you?” Agatha asks incredulously, as if Rio hadn’t been the one to come in here and ask her out for drinks, and if she was a less confident person, she would maybe think that the other woman hadn’t completely meant it. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha trusts Rio to pick a bar, or really, she doesn’t go to enough bars in this area to be able to suggest anywhere herself, luckily the place Rio picks is only a quick ten minute walk in the cold Boston evening. The bar is definitely not one Agatha has visited before, the owner seemingly having a preference for red neon lights and registration plates with other retro decorations, that look like they’ve come from a 1950’s garage, or more likely, an off broadway staging of Grease.</p><p> </p><p>The bar is occupied with much younger people, and Agatha makes sure to check that none of her students occupy any of the tables. Once satisfied she doesn’t have to keep any guards up for the <em> one </em> drink she is staying for, she looks for a spare table, somewhere more discreet… just in case. The leather - <em> fake </em> leather - creaks as she slides into a booth off to the side, all the while keeping an eye on the younger woman ordering them drinks. </p><p> </p><p>She doesn't know why she agreed so easily, the primitive side of her brain taking over for a moment as she ogled Rio in her office. The walk here had been quiet, neither really talking. Maybe it should have brought her back to reality and made her rethink, instead, she tried to sneakily catch glances of her companion. Every part of her should be screaming danger, it wasn’t. This should be the beginning of a horror story, a tale you tell children, agreeing to leave safety late in the evening and follow a stranger to an unknown location. Yet here she was, and seemingly not frightened or remotely alarmed. </p><p> </p><p>Instead, Agatha looks over her form from a distance now she knows she’s safe to do so, and she does so unapologetically. Her eyes run over the loose fitting jeans that only cling to her ass, the slouchy black jumper that drapes to expose the skin of one shoulder as she casually leans on the bar. The younger woman had seemed confident back in Agatha’s office, but it was clear she visited here often, she relaxed into the space, chatting with one of the bartenders that sends a weird pang of jealousy through Agatha. They had only met half an hour prior and said nothing but a few quick remarks, but Agatha wished she could make Rio’s head tilt back to expose the line of her throat like it was now as she laughed at something the woman behind the bar said. </p><p> </p><p>She distracts herself with folding her coat up and placing it on the seat next to her, hoping to avoid getting anything sticky or gross on it, she dares a glance back to the bar, to find Rio looking over her shoulder directly at Agatha, their eyes meet and the woman’s lips pull into a smirk. And Agatha just hopes that Rio is far enough away to not spot the slight blush that she feels creeping across her cheeks. </p><p> </p><p>The bartender, thankfully, regains Rio’s attention and Agatha takes the slight reprieve as a chance to get herself under check again, only for the sight of Rio walking back over to her with that same smile on her face to undo it. Rio slides into the opposite seat and passes Agatha a glass of white wine, not missing the suspicious look that crosses Agatha’s face. </p><p> </p><p>“I know you said red, but it's garbage here,” Rio answers the question on Agatha’s lips, relaxing back into the leather seat. “Also, I got you a bottle,” she holds her hand up at Agatha’s attempt to protest how she was only staying for one drink, her mouth opening and closing instantly, leaving her feeling like a fish for a moment, “But, I figured that at least I can assure you that it won’t have been open for a few days.” </p><p> </p><p>“That is all very considerate of you,” Agatha can't help the suspicious tone of her voice, “Do tell me though, where this bottle of wine is,” she throws Rio a wry smile, motioning to the lone glass in front of her with a slightly over dramatic flair.</p><p> </p><p>“Does this look like the sort of place to have a wine bucket?” She raises a brow, “I asked them to keep it in the fridge.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hums, half flattered by Rio’s actions, half amused at how she is trying to placate her. “You know.” She takes a small sip of wine, which turns out to be not as bad as she expected, “You could have just taken me to somewhere that does a decent wine instead of going to all those measures”</p><p> </p><p>“I like it here,” Rio shrugs casually before taking a swig of beer, “And I didn't know you would want wine until we arrived.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh I’m sorry for not expressing my beverage preferences earlier.” She teases and Rio huffs a breath of air in the form of laughter. “Would it have changed anything? If I said I wanted the best wine in the city.”</p><p> </p><p>“Nope.” Rio grins and Agatha can’t help the chuckle that escapes. “So apart from being a wine snob,” she laughs at Agatha’s mock offence, “What else do you get up to?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha raises a brow at the question. She isn't annoyed at it, mostly just amused at the change of tone from when Rio first entered her office, the straight to the point air that seemed to fly out the window once she showed her face. She wasn’t offended by it, it confirmed two things, other people were just as shallow as Agatha, and most importantly, she still had it. </p><p> </p><p>“Not a great deal,” she has no desire to impress the woman too much, “I read a lot, mostly for research purposes, but I like a good horror story, and I spend an extortionate amount of time marking terrible essays…”</p><p> </p><p>“If the students are truly that terrible, you should teach somewhere else.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ehhhhh. It’s fine really.” Rio gives her a questioning look and she rolls her eyes, “Everyone is terrified of me, I have a lot of free reign on what I teach and research, without half of the pressure some others have… also I get to be extra picky with my research associates.” </p><p> </p><p>“Well, I can't argue with that.” Rio laughs, warmly, tapping the neck of her bottle against the side of Agatha’s glass with a ‘ding’. “So how long have you been looking at The Green Witch?” </p><p> </p><p>“Um three-ish years, I came across her when I was researching my last book-”</p><p> </p><p>“The Ballad of the Witches Road: The Power of Song and Superstition within Witch Covens?” Rio cuts in reciting the essay’s book word perfectly. Agatha eyes her suspiciously, amused at how the younger woman had known it word perfectly despite the questioning lilt to her voice like she wasn’t sure. But she can’t stop the curiosity worming its way in at how Rio had known it, and how much else she knew about Agatha. She knew there wasn’t much out there on her, which she liked and tried hard to keep it that way, some other academics acted like B list celebrities, posting about their life and research, as if Billy the emo teen in their bedroom really cared about ‘The Impact of Mythology on the Politics of the Modern Western World’ or whatever bullshit half of her peers where writing about.</p><p> </p><p>“I… yes.” she stumbles out, her voice edged with caution.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hums seemingly satisfied with the answer and like she is weighing up something in her head, before speaking a moment later “So you like reading horror? Favourite book?”</p><p> </p><p>If she didn’t already feel on uneven ground after Rio’s perfect recitation, the harsh jump in topics is enough to throw Agatha off, leaving her scrambling for her brain to catch up and join Rio on the right page. Had there been some extra reading she forgot to do? Suddenly she understood the fear her students felt in seminars when she called on them to answer when they clearly didn't do the reading.  “I do…” She racks her brain for some book she likes, amused at the date-like questions taking place on this non-date, “The Haunting of Hill House.” </p><p> </p><p>Her favourite, a must read every year, a clas- </p><p> </p><p>“Classic,” Rio nods approvingly, “The scene with the hand? Chills everytime.” Agatha nods in agreement, as Rio leans forward, her eyes now impossibly dark in the low light of the bar are stricken with a serious look that stirs something in her stomach, “Important question,” the hardness in Rio’s tone puts her on edge, before a playful tilt of her head reveals her incoming joke “Lesbians?”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course!” She scoffs, “I mean they shared clothes.”</p><p> </p><p>“Wait,” her eyebrows shoot up, “That's your take away? They share clothes so they must be gay?” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh sorry, would you prefer me to discuss how the book on a whole is an allegory on the fear of coming out and Eleanor's sexual repression?” She teases, “Why don’t you provide a full analysis of your favourite book instead?” </p><p> </p><p>“Woah woah woah, I think that can wait until we’ve had another drink.”</p><p> </p><p>“Another drink?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, <em> Agatha </em>, you have a full bottle of wine to get through.” Rio smirks and Agatha can hardly suppress the eye roll, but instead of arguing back she elects to take a mouthful of wine, watching as Rio matches her actions with her beer. “Did you grow up here?” </p><p> </p><p>“Massachusetts, yes. But not Boston.” Agatha pauses, but Rio just looks expectantly, waiting for her to continue. “I grew up just outside Salem. You?” </p><p> </p><p>“Spooky.” Rio widens her eyes and raises her brows, her gap tooth smile only just visible over the rim of the bottle. “Bet you had some weirdo neighbours?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha groans comically over the top. </p><p> </p><p>“See, people always say that, but our neighbours were boring, just lived in the area because their families were there.” She takes a sip of wine, effectively shutting down the conversation, her usual defence mechanism when it came to questions about her childhood. Agatha can’t help but feel guilty as an awkward silence settles between them. Usually she would let the silence brew, but for a reason she can’t put her finger on, Agatha feels compelled to keep talking, “It was the tourists I needed to look out for. For about 6 months when I was 12 there was a man that camped naked in the woods that our house backed onto.” </p><p> </p><p>The joy in Rio’s expression when she starts telling the story makes impossible to stop as she starts another about a man convinced he descended from a werewolf tribe, it now becoming Agatha’s mission keep Rio entertained, as she tells her stories of the self proclaimed witches, and the real ones that would visit, to her boring neighbours that hated everything witch so much that she swore were part of the original witch hunters.</p><p> </p><p>At some point during their conversation Rio makes a small signal and the annoying bartender comes over instantaneously to top up Agatha’s wine and brings another bottle of beer for Rio. The action itself is almost grotesque, the wordless command, and Agatha can’t help but wonder how often Rio has pulled a stunt like this, the process being all too well oiled for her liking. It’s something she would berate a person for doing, but when Rio’s hand softly lands on top of hers and the other woman asks her whether it was as cool as Rio thought it was going to be or as cringeworthy as it felt, Agatha sighs with an unexpected affection for her and dismisses it as the younger woman attempting to impress her. </p><p> </p><p>It's after the second glass she first mentions her mum and the urge to move away for college that she realises she might be edging slightly into oversharing. </p><p> </p><p>“What about you then? Where did you grow up?”</p><p> </p><p>“It makes a lot of sense that you grew up in Salem though,” Rio muses, skipping over the question, “No wonder you’re into witches and stuff.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hums in agreement, the strong culture of the city she grew up in had been a heavy influence, the library where she would seek solace after school and on weekends was always stocked with literature on the occult and folklore, so it had been easy to gain an interest, almost logical. </p><p> </p><p>“So, is that how you discovered The Green Witch?” The question quickly sobers her up as she realises how little Rio was sharing, despite all the opportunities she had to input.</p><p> </p><p>“Hang on a second,” Agatha cuts in, throwing the other woman off, her face twisting into confusion, but she ignores her and carries on, “I have just rambled on for who knows how long. You have to at least tell me something about yourself. You know, after I so graciously cancelled<em> all </em> my plans to come here.” </p><p> </p><p>“What do you want to know?” Rio scowls, immediately becoming slightly too defensive, her nail picks at the label on the bottle in her hands for a second until she catches herself and straightens up, an impassive expression crossing her face that tells Agatha all she needs to know; Rio was avoiding sharing on purpose. </p><p> </p><p>“What are you studying?” She asks, taking pity on the other woman with an easy question. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m nearly finished with my PhD” Agatha raises her brow in question as Rio continues to not tell her any more information, <em> again </em>. Rio rolls her eyes, “In Environmental Science at MIT, happy?” </p><p> </p><p>Her mouth drops a little bit at the admittance, which Rio doesn't miss, “So, you go to one of the <em> top </em> schools in the country, with some of the <em> top </em> lecturers, yet here you are, asking little old me?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, this is more of a personal interest, rather than educational… And well you’re probably the second most knowledgeable person in the world about The Green Witch.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, who is the first?” She challenges, biting back a smile as she waits for Rio to admit she’s an expert on The Green Witch and ready to rebuke all her theories on the legend.</p><p> </p><p>“The Green Witch, <em> obviously </em>.” Rio flashes her a grin of white teeth, that unsettling feeling returning again, however, Agatha just finds herself laughing at the comment.</p><p> </p><p>“You should go ask her your questions then,” she says through her laughter. </p><p> </p><p>“But I don’t want to ask <em> her </em> questions, I’m interested in <em> you </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“Me?!” Agatha’s laughter falters, her chest clenches at the phrases, at the way Rio’s eyes flicker with some unknown energy, at the way Rio leans back on the seat, arm slung over the back of the bench, looking every bit intimidating and <em> hot </em>. When the younger woman told her she had questions she assumed they would be on The Green Witch. Yet the way Rio had been asking her about herself, watching her every movement as if she was trying to read her, made her rethink their initial interaction. </p><p> </p><p>Rio just smiles, almost like she can see Agatha’s thought process working at a hundred miles an hour, bringing the bottle of beer up to her lips, before pausing, deciding against taking a swig and dragging it along skin that makes Agatha’s mouth jealous. </p><p> </p><p>“You undig all this stuff on this forgotten legend, how? Why?” Rio raises a brow, her voice edged with intrigue? <em> Anger </em>? Agatha doesn’t know. She wasn’t expecting for her to want to know her motives, there didn't seem to be a reason why her uncovering stuff about The Green Witch would affect Rio. Unless she knew someone who was working on something similar, or… well that was it really, but despite her not being affiliated with MIT, she would have heard if someone was also working on a similar project. </p><p> </p><p>There’s a slight coldness to Rio’s eyes as Agatha hesitates before she answers. The other woman must catch herself doing it, face returning to neutral, masking it by taking a long drawn out sip of her beer, her fingers shooting up again as she nods to the bartender. She doesn't seem to have the same reservations as earlier, making Agatha wonder whether it was a front to gauge Agatha’s reactions. Maybe it's the second glass of wine on a mostly empty stomach, or just the confidence in Rio’s action but the easy control the woman seems to possess was now just kind of hot.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t really know…” Agatha pauses, trying to gauge what Rio’s motive was, “I came across her by fluke when I was researching ‘The Road’, and there wasn’t much about her to be honest, except that we were able to prove she was a <em> real </em> person, but it wasn’t anything crucial to what I was writing for ‘The Road’ so I didn't take much notice. Then, maybe a year later, I came across ‘Lady Death’ and the description was <em> identical </em>, it was eerie. But Lady Death was talked about as this deity, like Death itself, so I did a bit of digging and, well, every culture has gods and goddess of death, but that wasn’t what we were looking for, instead we were looking depictions for ‘Death’, so many were able to connect so many to the narrative of ‘The Green Witch’, how she would appear after death, the ability to control and manipulate plants, it was fascinating. Some accounts of her… I mean she had serious power, just always went by so many different names. Whether that was to stay under the radar or, just cultures, languages.</p><p> </p><p>“The Green Witch and Lady Death in North America, some Spanish cultures refer to her as La Pelona and the River of Life,” Agatha watches Rio’s face flinch momentarily, before smoothing back over. She considers drawing attention to it but decides to continue anyway, “I mean all across the world, through all ages, back to some of the earliest texts and civilisations. The Morrigan, Mictecacihuatl, Queen of the Great Earth, Morena. I could go on and on… But then she seemed to disappear, tales became whispers, whispers became breaths of a story and then it faded into nothing. It’s like a lot of myths and legends, as technology developed and ‘solid proof’ became a thing, rather than just believing, these things tend to die out. ‘Seeing is believing’ is everything these days, first and secondhand accounts don’t cut it anymore.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha feels heat rush to her face. Even when trying to turn the conversation towards Rio she still somehow ended up doing all the talking.</p><p> </p><p>“Or maybe, she got wise, doesn’t want to be filmed going about her business. No one wants to go viral if they haven’t done their makeup that day,” Rio counters in a serious tone, or jokes dryly, Agatha can’t quite be sure. Another statement that seems like a joke.</p><p> </p><p>But, Agatha can’t help but snort at the idea, “What, you think Lady Death wouldn’t appreciate boomerangs?”</p><p> </p><p>“Boomerangs?!” Rio nearly spits her beer out, “Catch up. Move into this decade.” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh shut up, I’m too busy-”</p><p> </p><p>“What, reading ancient texts and ghost stories?” Rio teases.</p><p> </p><p>“Says the woman who came to ask me questions on a legend for <em> personal interest reasons </em> ,” she scoffs defensively, but the dig doesn't seem to affect Rio. “So, why are you interested in The Green Witch?” Agatha tries to push Rio into answering some questions, <em> again. </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugs casually, taking a sip of her beer before continuing. “She seems like a badass.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can’t help but roll her eyes at that, “Jesus.”</p><p> </p><p>“What?! You said she can manipulate plants. I like plants.” </p><p> </p><p>“Is that why you’re studying Environmental Science?” She probes, hopeful for some detail.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, I suppose,” Rio takes a breath, almost as if considering whether to continue or not, “If you want to mix it all together into one sensible and soul bearing explanation, that means you will stop trying to get me to tell you stuff,” she gives Agatha a wry look, “She’s all about the cycle of life and death, the natural order of things… and well that's what I like, the symbiotic relationships between… everything.” Rio shrugs, going quiet and staring at her bottle.</p><p> </p><p>“Interesting, so is that what your thesis is on? The imbalance of humans is killing the world?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughs, “No. I mean it’s true, but no. It's on the role of mutualistic plant - rhizobacteria relationships and ecosystem stability.”</p><p> </p><p>“What?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio leans in, a smile spreading across her face, Agatha finds herself doing the same, a magnetic connection between their bodies as they both press close to each other, as if Rio was telling her the darkest of secrets, rather than just explaining her PhD. The press of the table in Agatha’s stomach is the only barrier stopping her from becoming even closer. But as much as Agatha wants to be a good student, she can’t stop focusing on how Rio’s eyes light up as she talks, her hands moving around animatedly, and consequently she gets lost at some point between nitrogen fixations and root pathogens. </p><p> </p><p>In turn, she asks Rio to explain in layman’s terms, telling herself she will pay more attention, but Agatha can’t concentrate, too focused on the way Rio flicks her hair over her shoulder and how the arm falls, fingers brushing against the side of Agatha’s hand resting on the table. Rio takes her hand flipping it over and uses the line of her veins to explain something to do with roots, distracting her even further, but she still finds the whole thing to be too confusing; leading her to ask stupid questions just to see how far she can push the other woman.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sighs, her energy draining as Agatha looks at her in a mock confusion, that actually conveys how she’s feeling, not that she wants Rio to know how lost she is on the whole subject. The other woman reaches across the table and grabs Agatha’s wrists, fingers wrapping around them in a soft but firm grip, her heart stuttering at the contact. </p><p> </p><p>“So this,” Rio wiggles Agatha’s right hand, and she can’t help but giggle as she feels like a naughty school kid being explained something in a basic manner. “Exists, because of this,” she wiggles her left hand, “and this,” she wiggles Agatha’s first hand, “helps this thrive, if the conditions are right.” She wiggles the second hand. </p><p> </p><p>“So they get each other off?” </p><p> </p><p>“What?” </p><p> </p><p>“The ritzy-bacteria?” She knows it's the wrong term, but the joy she gets from winding Rio up makes it worth it, and <em> maybe </em> she isn’t 100% on what the actual word is.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my gods. Yes. fine, they get each other off,” Rio groans, reluctant to try and explain any further and slumps back into her chair, her hands still cradling Agatha’s.</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever. My knowledge of plants is purely aesthetic, and I plan to keep it that way.” Agatha leans in grinning at how exhausted Rio has become due to her antics.</p><p> </p><p>“Favourite <em> aesthetical </em> flower then?”</p><p> </p><p>“Orchids.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks at her for a moment like she’s considering something, then cocks her head to the side, “You said you don’t date your students, why?” </p><p> </p><p>“A multitude of reasons.” Agatha answers almost immediately despite the whiplash at the change in conversation. In truth, most of Agatha’s students are just annoying, young and the sort of people she doesn’t really want to surround herself with. And while Rio is proving herself to be annoying and young, there's something more about her that Agatha doesn't mind, even through the bombardment of questions.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you date other people's students?” Rio presses on, and Agatha suppresses her amusement at where this conversation seems to be going.</p><p> </p><p>“Why are you interested? You said this wasn’t a date.”  She crosses her arms over her chest as she leans back into the creak of fake leather, feigning a defensive response, off the back of her earlier mistake .</p><p> </p><p>“I did, it’s just a drink.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Drinks, </em>” she corrects, eyeing the empty beer bottles on the table and Rio rolls her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>“Fine, <em> drinks, </em> and I can be interested… I’m a naturally curious person.”</p><p> </p><p>“Hmm, well you’re lucky it's not a date… it would be ranking pretty low if it were. Probably wouldn’t even put out at the end of it,” she pouts with a shrug.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyebrows shoot up in surprise. “Why?” </p><p> </p><p>“Got me the wrong drink, asked me <em>multiple</em> questions but didn’t even answer them yourself, <em>no</em> <em>food</em>, made me talk about work, oh and you talked about science for too long.” She counts out the offences on her fingers. </p><p> </p><p>“You asked about science?! I couldn’t not talk about it.” Rio’s voice rises, clearly agitated.</p><p> </p><p>“You ignored my other questions,” she snarks back, enjoying the rhythm of this far too much.</p><p> </p><p>Rio mumbles something under her breath, even in their close proximity Agatha doesn't hear it, then sighs adding reluctantly, “How can I turn it around?”</p><p> </p><p>“Is there anything to turn around? You said this wasn’t a date.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio groans in frustration. “Fine, it’s a date. Happy?” </p><p> </p><p>“Not really, I told you it was a bad one,” she lies, but she knows that Rio catches the slight twitch of her lip. Huffing out a frustrated breath, Rio plants her hands on the table and pushes herself up, sliding out of the booth. “Where are you going?” </p><p> </p><p>“Trying to make you happy,” she flings her arms up in exasperation, “I’m ordering food, then I’ll let you ask me questions about something that's not science. But I stand by my decision to not buy you red wine.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha tries to stop the laugh bubbling in her throat at the younger woman’s desperation, taking a moment to figure out how to tell her that ordering food from here would probably only make her crumble.</p><p> </p><p>“You wouldn’t eat anything from here would you?” Rio almost whines, her shoulders dropping, and Agatha realises she had obviously forgotten to don her poker face at the mention of bar food. Agatha gives a small shake of her head, her face scrunching up at the thought of the greasy bar food. At least she doesn't have to figure out how to tell her anymore. “Okay, well, what about an activity? Darts? I’ll let you throw one at me?”</p><p> </p><p>She looks at the dart board across from their table and rolls her eyes before she slides out of the booth, her head spins as the amount of wine she’s consumed on an empty stomach catches up to her. But she sidles up to Rio and leans in close, finding a confidence boost in the alcohol. “Fine, but you aren’t allowed to dodge.” </p><p> </p><p>Yes, Agatha has never played darts before, but how hard can it be? It’s just throwing spiky things at a target. </p><p> </p><p>It turns out darts is not one of her strengths, the first two bounce off the board and land with a shame inducing clatter on the floor, the third she somehow accidentally plants it into the wall to the side of the target. </p><p> </p><p>She tries to blame it on her lack of hand eye coordination and the wine making her miss her shots… she would never admit that the feeling of Rio’s eyes on her have something to do with her lack of concentration. That whenever she steals a sideways glance towards Rio, she finds dark eyes studying her, an amused smile that grows with each dart that misses. A smile that equally flusters and frustrates her.</p><p> </p><p>“You are <em> really </em> bad at this,” Rio laughs, collecting the darts, a soft grunt leaves her mouth as she dislodges the one from the wall. </p><p> </p><p>“I’d like to see you do better.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio, does in fact, do better, to the point where Agatha is almost impressed. If it wasn’t for the fact that Rio had just made her embarrass herself.</p><p> </p><p>But she finds it easy to forgive her when she watches Rio. Shoulders roll and she stretches her neck from side to side, Agatha nearly scoffs at how serious she is taking it, until her eyes drop to look at the sharp line of a jaw and the tendons of her neck are accentuated and instead she finds herself wanting to run her tongue along them.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha finds herself holding her breath as Rio aims and throws the three darts seamlessly through the air. Eyes fixated on her hand flexing with each toss, that she can’t drag them away to look at where the darts have landed, until Rio looks at her with a smug expression across her face. </p><p> </p><p>“170.”</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Her voice cracks, much to her dismay.</p><p> </p><p>“My score, I could have got 180 but I thought you would be impressed by a bullseye… it's more stylish.” </p><p> </p><p>“Show off.” </p><p> </p><p>“Now that we’ve established it’s a date I have to try and impress you a bit,” she leans in close, their bodies almost touching now that the barrier of the table is no longer there, the air vibrating as Rio continues to close the distance. Agatha’s hands clench into fists at her side as she tries to fight every instinct to reach out and touch her. The earthy tones and salt of her skin mingles with the smell of beer on her breath as she whispers in Agatha’s ear, “Did it work?”</p><p> </p><p>Then suddenly, Rio is gone, almost skipping towards the board and plucking the darts free. </p><p> </p><p>“No.” Agatha attempts to feign indifference, but the answer comes a second too late for it to be convincing. </p><p> </p><p>“Liar.” Rio presses the darts in her hand, “You’re up, m’lady.”</p><p> </p><p>If the first time she tried was bad, this was worse as she finds herself more distracted than the first round. Rio has kept her distance, leaning against their table and slowly swigging her beer, but she can feel Rio’s eyes on her, burning into the back of her head. She closes one eye, attempting to aim before throwing it, it flies through the air much less elegantly than it did with Rio before landing on the floor at the foot of the board. </p><p> </p><p>She lets out a frustrated groan, Rio snickers behind her and she finds herself biting her tongue, trying to keep her anger at bay. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay, you need to relax,” she hears Rio call over the noise of the bar, “Tilt the tip up.” Agatha follows her instructions, adjusting the position of the dart. “Yep, just like that, aim for the board, <em> good </em>, so take a breath, now flick your wrist to throw it, and… go.”</p><p> </p><p>She lets go of the dart, watching it fly towards the target, and… Her arms automatically fling up in frustration as it lands in the surrounding border, leaving her score at 0. Spinning around to face Rio, she starts to open her mouth to throw some sort of abuse and threaten to throw the dart at her, after the advice didn't help at all. Obviously, the other woman was just sabotaging her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio obviously senses what’s coming and places the beer to her side, pushing herself off the table and makes her way over in a few strides, an amused look on her face and Agatha finds her breath catching with every step Rio takes. Standing close to Agatha, her hands grab her hips and forcefully spin her around to face the board. The solid body of Rio pressed up against her is the only thing that anchors her to the spot as she stumbles with the unexpected movement. </p><p> </p><p>There’s a slight pause, then the hands on Agatha’s hips shift her, angling her body into a different stance, until Rio is apparently happy with the new position. Not that Agatha can focus on anything apart from the way Rio presses flush against her back. The heat radiating from the other woman sears through the barrier of their clothes, one of Rio’s hands stays on her hip, keeping her in place, while the other travels up to wrap around her own hand holding the dart in a commanding grip changing the height and angle of her arm.</p><p> </p><p>“So, tilt it again” The voice is warm and heavy in her ear, chin grazing against the dip between her neck and shoulder, and Agatha follows the direction without thought. “Then make sure you’re happy with the aim, remember to use your wrist… and then.” The dart seems to leave their hands, not that Agatha pays any attention to it, nor the solid ‘thump’ as it hits the board.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, her head drifts to look towards Rio, up close she can see the soft lines of her face and the curve of her nose, the way her dark eyes reflect the red neon light over the bar, leaving them a deep crimson, how her-</p><p> </p><p>“You aren’t paying attention, are you?” Rio grins, pulling her out of her daze momentarily before the other woman’s tongue darts out to wet her lips and Agatha’s eyes drop to follow the movement. All she can do is summon a slight head shake, the overwhelming need to close the distance seeming to override anything else. </p><p> </p><p>At that Rio smirks a little and raises a brow, like she can read her mind. </p><p> </p><p>So Agatha kisses her.</p><p> </p><p>It’s the first thing she hasn’t over analysed since the younger woman first stepped into her office earlier that evening. She doesn’t realise it’s happening until she’s twisting her body around in Rio’s grip, hands capturing the other woman’s face and bringing her into a kiss. The small shocked sound that spills from Rio’s mouth as their lips collide gives her a small amount of satisfaction that she has finally regained, or just gained, the upper hand. </p><p> </p><p>Rio kisses her back hard, hands moving to grab her waist, and Agatha finds herself stepping back with the sheer force of it until she knocks into the table, the clatter of glass drawing her attention back to their surroundings. As well as the rest of the bar. Eyes settle on them and Agatha feels herself flush at the sudden attention on them.</p><p> </p><p>Something Rio doesn't seem too bothered about though, who just steps closer, a hand coming to her chin and tilting her head up bringing her into a slow, searching kiss. It's anything but tentative, when Rio’s teeth nip at her lower lips, she can’t help the moan that escapes, something seems to spur Rio on, hands grabbing her hips and pressing her into the table. She is sure half of the bar is watching them make out like horny teenagers, but as Rio’s tongue licks into her mouth before disappearing again, she can't bring herself to care.</p><p> </p><p>“Will you come home with me?” Rio murmurs, their lips barely parted, the words travelling straight into Agatha’s mouth as she nods slightly before capturing Rio’s lips again roughly, the lingering taste of beer on her breath. It’s so intoxicating, that when she feels Rio pull away, the sting of disappointment shoots through her knowing they can’t stay where they are.</p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t know how long it takes to get to the other woman’s place. At one point, Rio drags her down a side street and she finds herself against the wall, while Rio kisses and bites down her neck and collarbones. Her hands grab at any part of Rio she can, moaning when she feels Rio’s thigh slot in between her’s to press against her core. It surprises her how into it she is, if anyone else tried to drag her into an alleyway and make out with her next to some bins she would read them to filth and leave their ass. Now? Well, she hardly contains the whine when Rio pulls away and takes her hand with a wink. </p><p> </p><p>The building Rio stops in front of is not what she had expected from a student, and if she was honest a small part of her had been worried about agreeing to go home with Rio. Not that she was a snob, but when the other option was a comfy, well furnished townhouse, she couldn't help but be worried about the unknown. She doesn’t have time to comment or wonder about how Rio can afford the place, before her hand is grabbed and Rio leads her through the door, up the stairs and through her front door.</p><p> </p><p>From the quick glimpse she gets of the flat it surprises her how well decorated it is, with a vast collection of artwork and <em> things </em>. But Rio’s mouth is back on hers and she finds herself pushing the younger woman against the front door, pinning her arms above her head to keep her in place, they kiss desperately, searching for each other’s mouths like oxygen. It's not enough, somehow, she still needs to close the little space that's left between them. She steps closer, Rio’s thigh slotting between Agatha’s again. She uses Rio’s slight height difference to her advantage, her hips move on instinct, grinding down, a gasp leaving her mouth, travelling straight into Rio’s waiting mouth. </p><p> </p><p>She happily uses the other woman for her own satisfaction, but when Rio’s hips roll up and the sensation is too much and too little at the same time. She can feel the wetness in her underwear growing, the thought of Rio’s tongue, hands, everything driving her insane. </p><p> </p><p>“God I want you to fuck me so bad,” she pants, her mouth pulling away from Rio, enough to make the other woman chase her in a needy dream like state, when the words finally catch up with Rio, her eyes open slightly.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah?” Her breathy voice hopeful, the sight of lidded eyes, swollen lips, flushed cheeks, only adding to Agatha’s desire. She wants, <em> needs </em>, the other woman.</p><p> </p><p>“You think you can do that?” Agatha pouts and those words are all it takes for Rio to bite at the challenge, a low growl spilling from her throat.</p><p> </p><p>The younger woman slips her wrists easily from Agatha’s grasp and crowds over her, until she can't do anything but walk down the hall.  </p><p> </p><p>Agatha lets herself be directed, Rio’s heated gaze still burning, a smirk across her lips as they make their way into what she can only assume is Rio’s bedroom. And maybe this is the point where she should ask whether she has any roommates, but she also can’t find it in herself to care. It's not that she has a chance anyway, before Rio pulls her into a demanding kiss. Hands tug at the bottom of her shirt, untucking it from her slacks, and slide underneath the fabric, nails scratching the skin lightly, bringing their bodies close together.</p><p> </p><p>Then it's not enough again, the two breaking away, heavy breaths filling the silence of the room as they strip each other of their clothes in an almost feral nature. Deft fingers work at undoing buttons, almost ripping them off, as Agatha’s hands gravitate to the hem of Rio’s jumper and pull it over her head. It's messy and uncoordinated, but once Rio steps out of her jeans, Agatha finally gets to appreciate the figure that had been buried under the bulky clothes all evening, her hands tracing down Rio’s chest and stomach, taut muscles contracting under her fingertips, coming to rest on her waist,. </p><p> </p><p>Rio tugs her forward by the waistband of her trousers, quickly undoing the button and zipper, and sliding her hand in the opening. Fingers trailing down the front of her underwear, coming to cup Agatha, a soft groan spilling from both their mouths. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re so wet,” Rio states the obvious, but before Agatha can snark or demand anything, Rio kisses her, <em> hard </em>, teeth clashing against each other’s as they almost attack each other’s mouth, desperate and needy. The hand toying with the growing wet patch on her underwear disappears for a second, before it pushes at the fabric on her hips.</p><p> </p><p>She steps backward, out of the fabric pooled at her feet, losing her balance when her legs hit the bed behind her. Rio takes advantage and pushes her to fall back onto the soft surface, before crowding over her, fingers returning to press against Agatha’s clothed cunt,  her hips bucking and rolling into Rio’s touch.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s kisses down her neck, mouthing at her breast, teeth biting her nipple through the fabric, pulling slightly, experimentally, she lets out a low noise, a wordless confirmation for her to keep going. Rio repeats it, biting harder, pulling further and she lets out a moan that’s near pornographic as pain sides with pleasure. When Rio looks up, a smug grin on her face, and Agatha wants to say something, gain some control, but is cut off by teeth sinking into the flesh on her other breast, the lace of her bra pushed to one side as Rio sucks and bites the skin, with a clear intent on leaving a mark.</p><p> </p><p>But none of it is enough, fingers tease, not touching where she wants, no matter how much she tries to manipulate Rio’s hand with her body, grind against it, just to release some of the pressure she can feel. </p><p> </p><p>“Rio, ple-,” she catches the word before it comes out, pressing her mouth closed quickly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn't let it slide though, eyes lighting up, “Say it.”</p><p> </p><p>She hesitates, not wanting to, but Rio’s hand retreats and desperation takes over.</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Fuck </em> , baby <em> , please. </em>” She lets the words leave her mouth, breathy, an attempt to be mocking, teasing, but it comes out more sincere than she intends, her entire body reeks of desperation in the way she practically squirms under the other woman. The hand returns, feather light touches trace up her thighs and over her clothed cunt. </p><p> </p><p>“Please, what?” Rio whispers, her lips brushing against Agatha’s ear. </p><p> </p><p>“Fuck me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Ask nicely.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wants to snap and wants to be angry, but the ache between her legs is so strong that she can’t summon the ability to, instead, for one of the first times in a while, Agatha gives in and accepts her fate.</p><p> </p><p>“Plea-ease Rio. Fuck me, please just fucking touch me. Rio please fuck.” She babbles, hating how needy and desperate the words sound. </p><p> </p><p>The contact against her core disappears immediately and she wonders if it was too much, coldness in lieu of the heat of Rio. Agatha’s eyes fly open and she watches the other woman in confusion as she walks to a chest of drawers that she hadn’t noticed at first and pulls out a black leather harness. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fuck. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mouth goes dry, her mind blank, she's sure her jaw drops.</p><p> </p><p>“Is this what you had in mind?” </p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t. </p><p> </p><p>It was way better than what her stupid tiny mind could come up with. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s legs part automatically, heat building in her stomach as Rio approaches, tossing the strap carelessly on the bed like it’s afterthought as she looks down hungrily at Agatha, standing between her legs. The room is only lit from the light spilling in from the hallway behind Rio, casting a slight shadow over her face, but it doesn't hide the desire in her eyes as she leans down, hovering just out of reach.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand confidently slides under her waistband and <em> finally </em> touches her, fingers no longer tease, running up her cunt before pushing into her. Her back arches into the touch, she can feel the pull of her underwear on her hips as the woman’s fingers slowly, torturously, pump into her. The heel of her hand occasionally nudges her clit, sending a shot of pleasure through her each time, eliciting an involuntary moan from the back of her throat. </p><p> </p><p>Her eyes flutter shut for a second, but the image of Rio hungrily smiling down to her is burnt into her eyelids. Then the feeling disappears, hand withdrawn quickly, as she is discovering Rio has the tendency to do so, leaving Agatha mourning the space between them. It's a short-lived feeling, however, Agatha’s eyes opening to watch Rio securing the harness on her hips. </p><p> </p><p>In one quick movement, she grabs Agatha's hand, pulling her up and turning her around, Agatha’s body moving bonelessly, completely to Rio’s command, fingers hooking into her underwear and pulled down. The silicon cock presses into the cleft of her ass as Rio steps up close behind her, a hand on her upper back firmly pushes her down, bending Agatha until her torso crashes into the soft of the bed under her, a knee knocking her legs further apart. </p><p> </p><p>Her breath hitches in anticipation as she lies there open and exposed, completely at Rio’s disposal as she slowly lines the silicone cock up, sliding it through her the slickness between her legs until Rio <em> finally </em> pushes in inch after inch. A low moan slips from her chest at the sensation, the relief, at feeling so full, but once Rio’s thighs and hips firmly pressed against her, the other woman pauses. Agatha’s patience starts to fray as she waits for Rio to start fucking her, the tension in the air, before she can turn around and demand for her to do something, Rio pulls out and snaps her hips in sharply.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha can’t stop the <em> ‘FUCK’ </em> that rips through her body and she ends up screaming into the room. </p><p> </p><p>Nails biting into the flesh her hips as Rio continues fucking into her roughly. She can hear Rio’s breath becoming ragged over the sound of her own moans and the lewd sound of skin hitting against skin. Her hips move of their own accord, moving back to meet Rio, pushing the silicon cock in further, her back arching into the contact.</p><p> </p><p>“Just like that, sweetheart.” She preens at Rio’s husky words, pressing her cheek into the comforter under her and glancing over her shoulder to see the other woman, dark eyes already boring into her, a light sheen across her face as she bites her lower lip. The sight alone is nearly enough to make her come but when one of Rio’s reaches around and ghosts circles over Agatha’s clit she finds herself babbling praises and pleas to the other woman, her orgasm building in her stomach, one well placed move away from erupting. </p><p> </p><p>Then Rio stops, freezing in her position.</p><p> </p><p>“Better than expected, eh?” Rio questions amusement in her voice and Agatha’s brain can't function enough to answer with anything other than a vague confused noise. <em> Did she just say that? </em> “What did you expect, Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p>I mean fucked out Agatha had a point, this was <em> way </em> better than she expected the evening to go. When Rio first stepped into her office that evening she had secretly hoped it would end in something similar to this, but at most was expecting to be asked a series of questions, share a drink and then part ways and hope she spotted her later that month at her lecture.</p><p> </p><p>“Questions.” Her voice is thick and hoarse, unrecognisable to her own ears. Immediately, she regrets answering, Rio’s hand withdrawing and resting on her hip, still tracing a small pattern, on her skin. Almost like she is considering something. </p><p> </p><p>“I can still ask you some, if you would like? I mean…  you’re in the perfect position to answer them.” Rio practically purrs, voice laced with mischief, wild eyes, starting to to fuck Agatha again, at a steady, brutal pace; Just enough to keep her from tipping over, leaving her on a razor thin edge.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you, <em> fuck, </em> kidding me?”</p><p> </p><p>“No. You can come when you answer them.” She growls. “Question One: Earliest record of The Green Witch?” </p><p> </p><p>“What? Is this a pop quiz?” She shoots back and Rio stops, pulling out almost completely, the grip on her hips keeps her in place as she attempts to draw her hips back. The whine of protest leaves her throat before she can stop it. </p><p> </p><p>“Answer the question.” Rio commands, the grip on her hips tightens even more, enough to leave bruises as Agatha attempts, again, to shift back, “I know you know this, <em> Dr Agatha Harkness </em>.”</p><p> </p><p>The complaint on her tongue at the patronising tone in Rio’s voice turns into a moan when the other woman slowly, <em> deliciously, </em> pushes back in and summons the information from some recess of her mind and slips off her tongue, “2900 BC, in some Sumerian text.”</p><p> </p><p>“Correct.” Rio starts fucking her again nowhere to the same intensity, Rio’s game clearly far from over, but it’s enough for Agatha to gasp when the purple silicon cock is buried inside of her. “Good girl.”</p><p> </p><p>The term sends her brain into factory reset mode. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can’t help the whimper that escapes at the word or the growl in Rio’s voice, making her want to do anything to be called a good girl again. Even if that means following the rules of this game.</p><p> </p><p>“Question two,” Rio continues, “What does she hold according to, hmm, <em> Mexican </em> cultures”</p><p> </p><p>“Scythe, that's common in a lot of cultures<em> , </em>or a globe.” She waits for Rio’s praise, or even just acknowledgement of answering correctly, but instead finds herself disappointed when Rio moves straight onto the next question.</p><p> </p><p>“Question Three and final,” Agatha almost teases at how short the game was. As much as she wants to come and then finally be able to get her hands on Rio, she was actually starting to have fun. And if she so happened to want to be called a ‘good girl’ again, that's nobody’s business but her own. “What did The Green Witch receive as tributes in Greece?” </p><p> </p><p>She screws her face up at the question. <em> Ah, that’s the catch. </em>Rio had saved the worst question until last. The Ancient Greeks had far too many gods and goddesses to be able to pin her down all that well, especially due to the fact that only a few brief accounts of some practices and death rituals from the mass public survived.</p><p> </p><p>There’s a glint in Rio’s eyes that tells her this was on purpose. </p><p> </p><p>“I, <em> fuck, </em> I don’t know, we aren’t too sure of her presence in Ancient Greece, too… many gods… I…” her words become nothing but a moan as Rio slows. </p><p> </p><p>“Come on <em> baby </em>, you know this one.” The combination of how Rio drawls the encouragement, the drag of the cock inside her and how she can hear Rio slowly losing her own composure sends Agatha tumbling towards the edge, chasing her release, the answer falling off her tongue as she feels the wave begging to crash over her body.</p><p> </p><p>“Figs.” </p><p> </p><p>“<em> Wrong </em>.” Rio whispers, the answer punches a wave of devastation through her body, shortly followed by anger as Rio stops completely leaving her on the edge, panting and borderline ready to beg. Burying her face into the comforter, a vague attempt of self preservation trying to suppress either the scream or begging pleas that threaten to leave her mouth. </p><p> </p><p>“It's… fucking <em> figs,” </em> she bites back, somehow summoning the strength to say something. She reaches back blindly, hoping to grab Rio’s hip, refusing to accept she had the wrong answer, refusing the punishment Rio is inflicting on her. But her hand is quickly captured and pinned to her back, Rio’s other hand slides up her spine, tangling in her hair and pulling her upright, the change of angle, the silicon cock burying itself deeper inside her.</p><p> </p><p>“No. It was persimmons.” Rio whispers hot and heavy in her ear. </p><p> </p><p>“No, no, no,” the words come out thick and slurred, her brain scrambling through the heavy fog to try and recall the documents sent through from the academics in Greece. “The texts from the library, <em> fuck, </em> in Athens said it was figs.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s translated wrong then. Persimmons were left at the site of the body and graves, people thought it would put The Green Witch into a <em> dreamy haze </em>and lead her to send the souls of their loved ones to the ‘good afterlife’…” Rio pauses, for a moment, deep in thought, apparently her mind far from the current situation; unlike Agatha, who can’t think of anything else. “True, figs are related to the Gods, and Persimmon translates to the Fruit of the Gods, so I suppose if the text was translated in Athens, rather than its original island… there’s dialects that could be mistranslated, I guess.” Rio ponders and Agatha fights the urge to scream again, her body suspended in limbo, in complete control of the other woman, who seems more concerned with the issue of dialect in Ancient Greece.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, please.” Maybe screaming at the other woman would be preferable to the begging whimper that left her mouth instead. It's enough, however, to draw Rio back to the situation at hand, thankfully. </p><p> </p><p>“Okay, I’ll give you another question and if you get it right then you can come on my cock, okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha whimpers, her head nodding desperately, she can feel her climax coming as Rio starts to fuck her again slowly, the knot in her stomach starts to tighten again and she knows Rio will keep on this ledge for as long as she wants. </p><p> </p><p>“What animal does she carry with her?”</p><p> </p><p>“Spider.” She looks across to the tank on the chest of drawers, spotting a tank housing an eight legged creature, she flaps her hand in the direction, “One of them. Tarantula.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well done sweetheart.” Rio almost growls, hand loosening in her hair and she finds herself being pushed back down into the bed, as Rio thrusts into her, punching a sob out of her, her wrist held behind her back released so she can grab the comforter, her knuckles turning white as she fists the fabric. </p><p> </p><p>One hand slides from her hip, wrapping around her front fingers easily finding her clit again and pressing on the bundle of abandoned nerves. Her orgasm rips through her so suddenly with an intensity that has her forget everything, even her own name. </p><p> </p><p>The only thing on her mind is <em> Rio. </em> </p><p> </p><p>It’s Rio’s name she screams loudly.</p><p> </p><p>It’s Rio’s name she chants over and over again until she runs out of breath.</p><p> </p><p>It’s Rio’s name that stays on the tip of her tongue as she tries to suck in air to her lungs. </p><p> </p><p>The other woman stills inside her, buried to the hilt, fingers still pressing, holding her in place as she chases the final waves, murmuring praise made up on unknown words into her ear.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha’s laboured breath finally eases and she regains awareness of her surroundings, she feels Rio’s grip loosen, letting her fall gently onto the bed. At some point Rio discards the strap on the floor and flop on the bed next to her, fingers combing through her hair, brushing the strands plastered on her forehead out of the way. </p><p> </p><p>“Jesus <em> fucking </em>Christ,” she laughs eventually, rolling onto her back and staring up at the ceiling, sparing a quick glance across to see Rio with a toothy grin staring back at her. </p><p> </p><p>“Close, but the name is Rio, actually.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, but finds herself laughing at Rio’s stupidity anyway, before craving to touch the other woman again. Rio must sense it, because she shuffles over on the bed, pressing against Agatha’s side and capturing her lips in a soft kiss. When they pull apart there's a warm look on Rio’s face that she hadn’t seen this evening, putting a weird unfamiliar feeling in her stomach that she tries to put down to post sex euphoria and not the way Rio bumps her nose against hers, before kissing her again gently, hand coming to cup the side of her face.</p><p> </p><p>She chases Rio’s lips as she pulls away. </p><p> </p><p>“Water?” Rio asks, with a slight head tilt, and it's actually the last thing Agatha wants, what she really wants is Rio. Rio in about 5 different ways.</p><p> </p><p>But, now that her attention has been brought to her mouth, and how much she could do with a drink… well it's all she can focus on. She nods, using up the last of her energy, but when the other woman stands to move away she finds herself moving as well, wandering out behind her, almost like a lost puppy, trailing through Rio’s apartment on shaky legs. </p><p> </p><p>The other woman notices, looking over her shoulder at Agatha hot on her heels, raising a questioning brow. She doesn’t have an answer, not a logical or rational one at least. Maybe she can put it down to being curious about the apartment she was so swiftly moved through.</p><p> </p><p>The first thing she notices is how <em> full </em> it is, every surface seems to have something on. Not in a messy way, just trinket after trinket, small little objects from day to day life of civilizations of the past that look like they belong in a museum cabinet. And if there's not a trinket there, there's a plant. Rio wasn’t kidding when she liked plants. On the window sill is a collection of sprouting plants in glass tubes all developing at different stages, one end of the room houses a bookshelf full of books ranging from ones that look like they were bought yesterday, to looking like the paper might crumble if you stared at it for too long. </p><p> </p><p>Before she can venture to look at the books Rio turns around with a glass of water in hand, “In full transparency, I was not expecting guests.” When Agatha shoots her an amused look, Rio shrugs, passing the glass over. “I’m a student, I <em> have </em> to live in a perpetual mess.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why don't you try and break the stereotype?” </p><p> </p><p>“Says the lecturer who just fucked a student.” Rio answers with a cocky smile.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh shut up.” She shoots back, before taking a long drink of the cold water,” And as I recall you did most of the fucking.” </p><p> </p><p>There's a moment of silence, perhaps the longest one they’ve shared all evening, as they both take in each other, or that’s what Agatha is doing at least, letting her mind wander back to Rio pulling her hair, whispering into her ear… </p><p> </p><p>And the most orgasm brain fog has cleared enough for something to dawn on her, “Were you lying about the Greek thing?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes widen as she freezes, looking slightly nervous. “Uhhh, no.” </p><p> </p><p>It dawns on Agatha that Rio hadn’t expected to get caught, or expected her to remember. </p><p> </p><p>“How do you know that then?”</p><p> </p><p>The other answers weren’t difficult to figure out. Some of the oldest written texts out there belonged to the Sumerian civilisations, a lot of depictions of death included scythes and well she could have just agreed to the whole globe answer. But Ancient Greece was something she had the best part of a year on, trawling through countless archives and persuading one very grumpy lecturer to translate some old death ritual one of her research associates found. So the fact Rio just completely shut it down as incorrect for the sake of their game, <em> or </em>, was right and it was incorrect, left her feeling slightly bitter.</p><p> </p><p>“I guess I should tell you my real name.” Rio takes a deep breath, and Agatha can figure out where this is going, or why the other woman is fidgeting on the spot. “Rio Vidal.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha looks at her blankly, the gears in her brain churning and trying to work out why that’s such a big deal, searching the address book in her mind of anyone she knows by the name Vidal, and why the younger woman chose this moment to disclose it to her. </p><p> </p><p>The Spanish name for ‘<em> full of life </em>’, the -</p><p> </p><p>“Which is Spanish for Riv-”</p><p> </p><p>“River of Life.” Agatha murmurs, her brain struggling to comprehend what is happening, something she would imagine she would struggle with even without an evening of drinking and a mind blowing orgasm that she just experienced 5 minutes prior. The next words leaving her mouth before she has a chance to bite her tongue, “The Green Witch?” </p><p> </p><p>“I’ve been <em> dying </em>to meet you Agatha.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha can’t help the snort that escapes as she breaks into laughter, her hand coming up quickly to cover her mouth, clamping her lips shut to stop another laugh escaping, which is just unsuccessful, another giggle escaping, despite Rio’s souring mood. </p><p> </p><p>“Bullshit. See, <em> this </em> is why I don’t date students.” Agatha points an accusing finger at Rio, disappointment settling in.</p><p> </p><p>She watches as Rio bristles, her jaw clenching, arms crossing over her chest. “I’m-“</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah. Suuureeeeeee.”  </p><p> </p><p>“I’m being <em> serious! </em>” Rio huffs, a slight pout forming on her lips. And Agatha isn’t completely sure what is happening, whether this is another kind of Rio’s games or if by some weird crazy chance, The Green Witch happens not only to be real, but a PhD student living in Boston. </p><p> </p><p>Yet, crazier things have happened, right? </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Have they?  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>So, she takes a chance.</p><p> </p><p>“Cmon, lady death, prove it to me then.” She purrs.</p><p> </p><p>If Rio really is who she says she is, it's gonna take a lot of persuasion.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Out of all of the things Rio expected to happen this evening, this was not it. </p><p> </p><p>The original plan of breaking into an empty office quickly went downhill when she saw a figure sitting at the professor’s desk, and the plan may as well have plummeted off the side of a cliff when her traitorous body decided to knock on the door and enter the office. </p><p> </p><p>Thick brunette locks cloaked around her were tossed dramatically over her shoulder and when she finally saw the face of the professor clearly, Rio knew she was in trouble. The sharp blue eyes practically devoured her from the moment they finally looked up at her, and Rio could hardly suppress her smile at the thought of where the night could end.</p><p> </p><p>Now here she was, on her knees in her kitchen with <em> Dr. Agatha Harkness </em> making the most delicious noises above her. </p><p> </p><p>The other woman’s hands grip her hair at the roots, every tug and scratch of nails sends a shiver down her spine that erupts at her core. If the hands controlling her head weren’t enough to keep her in place, the leg slung over her shoulder does a good enough job. The feeling of Agatha’s heel digging into her back, grounding her to the present as she feels herself slipping under the other woman’s spell as she rides Rio’s face; using Rio entirely for her pleasure.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had dropped to her knees with only three words and a pointed look from the other woman. </p><p> </p><p>Death never submits to anyone, but this wasn’t anyone. </p><p> </p><p>This was Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>This was the woman who laughed when Rio told her who she was. </p><p> </p><p>This was the woman who looked Lady Death in the eye and said <em> ‘Prove it to me then.’ </em></p><p> </p><p>And Rio was determined to prove it. Once she got over the initial disbelief of what she had just willingly admitted to the woman before her, she felt her magic crackle in her palm as she drew energy from the room, only for Agatha to raise an eyebrow and say those three simple words. </p><p> </p><p>“<em> On your knees.” </em> </p><p> </p><p>She dropped hard enough to crack the kitchen floor tiles. Who could blame her? Agatha stared down at her, completely bare, save her bra, a cruel smile on her face that set her stomach squirming. </p><p> </p><p>Throughout all of existence, she had never tasted anything as fine. Agatha was ambrosia and Rio was a woman, starved. She can feel by the way Agatha’s legs are starting to shake, her movements becoming more erratic with each stroke and flick of Rio’s tongue that Agatha is close. Her body twitches and Rio can feel how her one leg has started wobbling, as Agatha struggles to stay upright. </p><p> </p><p>It doesn't take much for Rio to lift her onto the counter, arms circling Agatha’s thighs as she pushes her body up. Agatha yelps in surprise at the sudden movement, fingers clasping Rio’s hair even tighter than before and she can’t help the moan that slips out at the sweet sting of pain. </p><p> </p><p>“<em> Fuck, </em>a bit of warning next time,” Agatha pants out, and Rio’s mouth is too busy to reply, so she simply rolls her eyes instead. Not that the other woman notices anyway, her head tilted back, exposing her neck and jawline Rio had been admiring all night. </p><p> </p><p>But now that Agatha is more controlled, Rio can finally focus on fucking her until she sees the heavens and stars. Two fingers stroke and tease at Agatha’s entrance as her mouth focuses on circling the bundle of nerves with the flat of her tongue. The response is music to her ears, the way Agatha’s breath hitches, her voice raising an octave as she praises Rio, murmurs and cries of <em>‘you’re so good at this’, ‘right there’, ‘don’t stop’ </em>and an extensive list of expletives and phrases that Rio is impressed by for someone who has been on the earth for such a short period. </p><p> </p><p>When she finally pushes her fingers in all the way, curling them abruptly, Agatha comes with a cry, her legs bracket Rio’s head holding her in place and as much as she loves the feeling of her lover's thighs wrapped around her head, she mourns not being able to hear all the noises coming out of Agatha’s mouth at full volume. </p><p> </p><p>She doesn't relent, Agatha trembles and grinds against her, riding her orgasm out, only quickly to fall over the edge again, much to Rio’s delight. Even as the pressure and intensity build up again, there’s nowhere else she would rather be than suffocating between Agatha’s legs. With one final jerk, the vice-like grip on Rio’s hair loosens, the legs trapping her in place disappear and Agatha slumps back, something rolls off the counter, landing on the floor with a smash. Rio couldn’t care less. Not when Agatha bends forward, hands cupping her face and pulling her into a tragically tender kiss, groaning as she licks into Rio’s mouth and tastes herself. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know how that proved anything,” Rio smirks against Agatha’s lips, pushing herself up to stand between Agatha’s legs, appreciating the pain shooting through her knees from being on the cold tiles for so long.</p><p> </p><p>“It proved you can do more with your tongue than just sprout lies.” </p><p> </p><p>“Are you-” Rio huffs and takes a deep breath to calm herself only for it to come up short as she sees the hard-set jaw of the other woman, the stubbornness in both of them starting to settle, “I’m not lying! I… I- how would I benefit from lying to you?” </p><p> </p><p>“Look, I find it a little difficult to believe.”</p><p> </p><p>“You think The Green Witch is not only real but is also <em> Death </em>, so why is it so hard to believe it’s me?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pauses, stumbling over the air. Rio can see the gears in her brain turning, the way her eyebrows furrow slightly and her eyes narrow, all as she tries to think of some other rebuttal. And Rio knows she’s just won as Agatha’s mouth does that cute thing she saw her do a couple of times that evening, of opening and closing before pressing into a straight line; accepting defeat. </p><p> </p><p>“<em> See. </em>” Rio teases, running her hands up the length of Agatha’s thighs to rest on her hips, pulling  Agatha forward to sit on the edge, her slick core pressing against her stomach. Agatha’s eyes flutter shut, her head dropping to rest against Rio’s as she takes a harsh shaky breath. </p><p> </p><p>“I just find it difficult to believe that I’m in her kitchen.” Her voice is low and hoarse, starting to show just how wrecked she is and Rio has to hide her chuckle, her hands on Agatha’s hips, guiding her to rock gently. “Rio.” Agatha manages to gain the slightest bit of authority.</p><p> </p><p>“Mhmm?” </p><p> </p><p>“This isn’t fair.” </p><p> </p><p>“Why?” Rio does a poor imitation of innocence, still guiding Agatha, who moves lazily against her.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, instead of ignoring my questions, you’re now just distracting me with…”</p><p> </p><p>“Sex?” </p><p> </p><p>“Exactly.” </p><p> </p><p>“But you're so hot, don’t deprive me of such things…” She pouts, but Agatha stays silent and Rio can tell she is trying her best to suppress her body’s response to Rio’s cruel attempt of distraction and keep some form of authority she so dearly likes to cling onto. But when Agatha raises her brow and shoots another one of those stony looks that makes Rio crumble, her movements quickly come to a halt and she yields to Agatha once again with only a look. “Okay, how can I make it up to you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hmmm,” Agatha mocks thinking for a moment, then leans in, whispering “Take me back to bed,” in her ear, and just the way the words drip off her tongue has Rio’s eyes rolling back into her skull. </p><p> </p><p>“Yes, <em>professor.</em>” Rio half teases, half tests the water, and her curiosity finally wins on whether Agatha has been lying about dating students. It has been a common occurrence ever since the beginning of academia that professors date their students. And well maybe, <em>just</em> <em>maybe,</em> she is curious about the whole dynamic. However, Rio never lucked out with getting any professors she wanted to fuck, and specifically finding a professor meant having to learn about people and that was more effort than Rio usually liked to put in. </p><p> </p><p>“Nope.” She swats Rio’s shoulder, and that gives her the final confirmation she needed that was the end of that experiment (for now anyway). “Not doing that.” </p><p> </p><p>“C’mon, <em> Dr Harkness </em>,” Rio pouts. And yes, she will drop it, but the way Agatha is so easily wound up makes this way more fun.</p><p> </p><p>“Chance over, you’ve lost your privileges now.” Rio can’t help the laughter that escapes at Agatha’s defiance, the way her head turns away, despite how the rest of her body remains in the same position. And Rio knows she’s lost nothing, but she’s willing to bite.</p><p> </p><p>“What privileges would they be? Huh?” </p><p> </p><p>“The privilege to touch me…” Agatha draws a line up Rio’s arm with her fingertip and she fights the need to tell her she is still touching her, quite a lot actually, “Or the privilege for me to fuck you, or… hmmmm that’s probably it really” </p><p> </p><p>Rio knows it's all an empty threat, she isn’t omniscient by any means, no god is, but she knows enough to see how the rest of the evening is going to go and Agatha leaving right at this moment in time because she called her ‘professor’ is not it. So instead she slides her hand under Agatha’s ass and picks her up from the counter, spinning them around and marching back down to the bedroom. Arms and legs wrap around her tightly as the other woman does something completely unexpected; Agatha squeals with a mix of delight and terror that evolves into the most cackle-like giggle Rio has ever heard as she buries her face into the side of her neck.</p><p> </p><p>“God, you’re strong.” Agatha giggles.</p><p> </p><p>“What else did you expect? I’m an all-powerful deity, of course I’m strong.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Or </em>you just hit the gym in your spare time.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio bites the inside of her cheek, battling the need to do something drastic, just to prove her point but Agatha leans back slightly, removing her face from the nook of Rio’s neck, the ghost of laughter on her face, piercing blue eyes bright with amusement and Rio’s mind stays focused on one thing: getting them to bed again.</p><p> </p><p>She drops her on the bed perhaps a bit rougher than expected, and watches the other woman land with a slightly unceremonious bounce, but before Agatha can complain or say anything Rio climbs onto the bed and straddles her hips. “Now what?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sits up, their chests touching and Rio can feel her breath coming thick and fast, even as she tries to remain calm.</p><p> </p><p>“Now we're going to play a little game.” That cruel smile reappears and Rio knows she's in for a world of pain, her earlier fun was coming back to bite her in the ass already. “Every question you answer is a touch you get. You get to choose where,” Agatha trails a finger down Rio’s chest, resting at her sternum, “So if I asked… Where did you grow up?”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you giving me an incentive to answer questions?” Rio smirks at the woman’s constant need for answers to questions that don’t apply to her. But she’ll admit Agatha is tenacious, and well after walking on earth since its creation, this exact moment confirmed that karma is indeed a bitch.</p><p> </p><p>“Bingo.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do you <em> really </em> think that’s going to work?” </p><p> </p><p>As soon as the words leave her mouth she regrets them. Agatha nips at Rio’s waist, her whole body jolting in response and the other woman takes the opportunity to shuffle away from under her, moving up the bed and out of Rio’s reach. A pout fixes itself on her face as Agatha turns to look far too proud at her success, and even though it's only a small distance between them, it's still far too much.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” Rio grumbles in protest, attempting to reach out but Agatha swats her hand and dodges her touch and falling back into the pillows at the head of the bed, she has to stop herself from diving on the other woman, depending on how long she keeps this up, Rio might have to resort to. </p><p> </p><p>“Answer the question then.” Agatha looks smugly down at Rio at the bottom of the bed. </p><p> </p><p>“Ughhhh, fine, I didn’t grow up anywhere.” She pauses, trying to think of the best way to describe how she was spat out into the universe with the knowledge that life must be created and destroyed. Agatha shoots her a look that has her metaphorical balls shrivelling up inside of her and she decides that saying something is better than making the other woman wait for a coherent explanation. “Alright, I hadn’t finished. I just… was? I came from chaos. Not always in this form, but that's not saying I ‘grew up’. But yeah, I’ve just always been here.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hums suspiciously, eyes narrowing as she seems to be weighing up Rio’s answer, it makes her wish she could read Agatha’s mind just based on the mental gymnastics that seem to be going on as she determines if Rio is lying or not. After what seems like an age, Agatha gives a curt nod and says “Well done, pick a place.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t hesitate, crawling back towards the other woman, whose legs open for her. She kneels between Agatha’s legs, like worshipping at an altar, her palms stroke up Agatha’s legs coming to rest on the crease between her thigh and hip, letting her thumb stroke gently over the soft, tender skin. An eyebrow is quirked in response, Agatha’s gaze flicking down to her thighs, as if maybe she was expecting more, but she doesn’t say anything, instead, she just clears her throat. </p><p> </p><p>“Has it always just been you?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio breathes a sigh of relief when Agatha asks that, finally deciding to not fight her on the answer because she was expecting her to say something like Delaware. “No, there is also Gaea, my sister… of sorts. She is the mother of all life, whereas I am the mother of all death.”</p><p> </p><p>“Next spot.” Agatha nods, accepting the answer with minimum thought. Rio’s hands slide up her body, over the valley of her waist, to cup her breast through the lace bra. Agatha releases a shuddering breath as she toys with her nipple through the fabric, her pupils blowing out and looking exactly how Rio feels. Desperate. Her eyes flutter shut but when they open again there's a playful glint in them as she looks down at Rio’s hand, a smirk crossing her lips and she tilts her head, “You can take it off you know.”</p><p> </p><p>“Shouldn’t I have to answer another question for that privilege?” She teases and hopes she doesn't regret it, but Agatha shrugs her shoulders in a carefree fashion. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s on the house.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio is sure she hears the rip of fabric as she tries to remove the bra as quickly as possible so she can return her hands to the warmth of her body. She drops her mouth, unable to battle the overwhelming need to kiss the pale skin, only for her movement to be blocked by a hand wrapping in her hair and pulling her head back, her gaze level with Agatha’s.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t say you could do that, did I?” Agatha asks, her grip tightens until Rio shakes her head, despite the sting of pain at the movement. She sighs disappointedly, “Next question then, do you still see Gaea?” </p><p> </p><p>“Yes, quite often, our paths cross every century, or so,” Rio answers quickly and waits like a dog for Agatha’s approval of a quick nod and to release the handful of her hair, before she drops her mouth to her breast, tongue licking over the sweet skin. Tracing her tongue around the hardening nipple, relishing in the noises she's summoning on the other woman, pulling away she watches a trail of saliva stretching out until it breaks and she blows gently on the damp skin, watching it pebble as the cool air hits it. She returns her mouth to the other breast, wondering how long she can get away with it until Agatha pulls out the rulebook.</p><p> </p><p>She bites down hard on a piece of unmarred skin, and sucks hard, Agatha squirming underneath her, her moans filling her ears, hands tangled through her hair to keep her head in place. The woman underneath shifts, her thigh brushing against Rio’s clothed cunt, and she can no longer ignore her building arousal between her legs. She groans, her hips twitching and craving more contact as she can no longer concentrate on anything else. </p><p> </p><p>Neither can Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>There’s an awkward, flustered moment while they scramble, rearranging limbs, hands grabbing as Agatha pulls at Rio’s hips and legs until each other’s thigh is against the other core. </p><p> </p><p>“Is that allowed? Surely I should answer a question or something first.”</p><p> </p><p>“Shut up, it’s my game.” Agatha snaps back, her thigh pressing in hard against Rio’s core, hands sliding up into her hair and pulling her face in close. “Anyway, you weren’t picking anywhere for me to touch. I had to take it into my own hands.”</p><p> </p><p>“But you’re breaking the rules.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re such a rule follower,” Agatha mutters with an eye roll but before Rio can say anything she adds a casual, “I guess I can stop.”</p><p> </p><p>She isn’t proud of the whine that leaves her mouth, and luckily Agatha takes pity, her leg remaining in place, lightly pressing against the increasingly soaked fabric of her panties. She even appeases her by throwing in a, “Go on, earn it, what magic can you do?” </p><p> </p><p>“All of it.” She answers far too quickly, remembering Agatha’s distaste for not vague answers once it’s too late. </p><p> </p><p>“Not an answer.”</p><p> </p><p>“I mean, it <em> is </em> an answer.” Rio states, gritting her teeth, fighting to give in to the pleasure too much, not until she deserves it at least, “But my favourite is plant magic” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh yeah? You can pick your reward now. ”</p><p> </p><p>“I thought this was my reward?”</p><p> </p><p>“So you don’t want another-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn't want to hear another smart-ass comment from Agatha’s mouth, pushing her thigh up to Agatha’s slick core, and cutting her off with a moan. The feeling of Agatha’s cunt against the skin of her thigh sets off something feral inside her, her hips speeding up, as they fall into a rhythm, she captures Agatha’s mouth, moaning into the warm wetness as the coil in her stomach tightens, their movements becoming frantic and messy as they both chase each other’s pleasure. Rio loses first, the coil snapping as she drives her hips down, crying words in ancient languages she had long forgotten. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha follows close behind, their mouths a collision of teeth and tongue clashing as Agatha’s mouth devours Rio while they both ride their orgasms. There’s no pause before Agatha pushes Rio back, a wicked gleam in her eyes and climbs on top of her. </p><p> </p><p>“What no more questions?” She pants out.</p><p> </p><p>“Shut the fuck up.” Agatha grins playfully before sliding down Rio’s body dropping open-mouthed kisses as she goes, until she reaches the top of Rio’s, now ruined, underwear and begins to pull them down.</p><p> </p><p>Rio loses track of how many times she comes, all she knows is by the time Agatha’s fingers are buried deep inside with her mouth wrapped around her clit she can’t take anymore. </p><p> </p><p>She uses the hands in Agatha’s hair to guide her up, greeting her with a languid kiss, just to keep the smug look off her face.</p><p> </p><p>“Where have you been all of my existence?” Rio whispers between kisses, tracing a hand over the curves of Agatha’s body.</p><p> </p><p>“I bet you say that to all the girls.”</p><p> </p><p>“Just you.” It comes out more earnest than Rio intends, Agatha arches a brow and Rio has to suppress a huff, instead opting to roll onto her back, putting some distance between herself and Agatha, “I don’t tend to tell people about the whole ‘being Death’ thing…”</p><p> </p><p>Truthfully, she had never willingly told anyone her identity, Rio could probably count the times people found out who she was on one hand.  And the number of people who met their fate just after was equal. </p><p> </p><p>“What makes me so special?” Agatha teases, and Rio just shrugs, refusing to look in her direction, her ceiling is much more interesting anyway. But she doesn’t know how to answer that question, her original plan for that evening didn’t even include the possibility of talking to Agatha. It was more of a ‘break in and get out as quick as possible’ type of plan, just to see if there was anything that told her what Agatha had found in her research and whether she needed to be worried. Instead, the woman she found set off something stupid and so <em> human </em> inside of her that by the time she was just about to tell Agatha, she was too drunk, and horny, to realise the gravity of the situation. But before she gives the noncommittal answer of ‘I don’t know’, Agatha sighs and continues, “Rio. I’m not gonna lie, I still think you’re just being a bit of an idiot.”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t think I’m some mythical deity then?” She looks across to see Agatha watching her, just as she had been watching her all evening, and suddenly feels under an amount of scrutiny that she hasn’t experienced in… well, <em> ever </em>. The woman refuses to believe her, and in hindsight, she doesn’t blame her. To the human brain, the concept is hard to grasp, it’s one of fairytales and myths that even the most intelligent humans would struggle with. Agatha was smart, smart enough to know that she was most likely lying, but smart enough to know that Rio knew too much on the subject to not be lying.</p><p> </p><p>“I could tell you stories and tales that your human mind couldn’t even begin to comprehend.” </p><p> </p><p>“Are you calling me stupid?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m calling you <em> human </em>.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hums, seeming to relent and there's a moment of silence before she clears her throat and grabs some of the strewn-out blankets to cover herself, “Go on then, blow my tiny human mind.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio starts to tell a story about how Gaea had plucked light from the chaos to form stars and how Rio had crushed them in her hands, giving each and everyone a lifeline, letting them destroy everything in their path as their own lives ended, only to notice the evened out breaths of Agatha coming from beside her a moment later, the light from the hallway illuminating her face, looking peaceful. She can’t recall the last time she slept, a seemingly pointless task for an immortal deity. A waste of unlimited time she has possession of. But the warmth of the body next to her draws her in, and she closes her eyes, draping an arm over the woman next to her.</p><p> </p><p>She will never know what sleep is like for mortals, never understand the feeling of waking up refreshed or still tired and chasing dreams. So when Rio wakes in the morning, her eyes take a moment to adjust to the light streaming through the window, noticing the pleasant ache from between her legs before she realises the cold from the other side of the bed. </p><p> </p><p>The sheets are still crumpled from where the other woman lay, but that’s the only trace that remains, the clothes that had littered the floor the night before have disappeared. A glimmer of hope remains as she pads naked through the apartment, only to find it empty. </p><p> </p><p>She grabs the half-empty glass of water they had shared the night before and returns to bed, hoping to suppress the disappointment stirring in her stomach.</p><p> </p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>It's been three weeks and Rio hasn’t heard from Agatha; not that she's keeping count. </p><p> </p><p>Death is too busy to focus on mundane details such as days, or weeks. No, Death is far too busy doing much more important things than thinking about a woman.</p><p> </p><p>That's what Rio tells herself anyway. </p><p> </p><p>Her mind, however, has different ideas, drifting back to thinking of Agatha time and time again. Whether she’s doing something as mundane as grocery shopping, or when her hand gravitates between her thighs late at night, or even as she sinks into a burning hot bath, perfumed with a rich floral smell that's reminiscent of the scent the other woman left on her bed sheets. </p><p> </p><p>And the fact that she has taken to growing Orchids? That’s purely coincidental.</p><p> </p><p>Rio never gets hung up on women, or people in general, it's futile to do so. People are only a snapshot in Rio’s existence. She watches years unfold as humans do minutes. </p><p> </p><p>Gaea learnt the hard way not to get attached, Rio had watched from afar as her heart was broken, all while the knowledge she could offer the human more time burnt deep in her soul. But she feared she could only offer so much time and death would come for Gaea’s lover in the end anyway, so Rio never did anything, there was no point delaying the inevitable. And instead vowed to never make the same mistake.</p><p> </p><p>It ticks over into week four when she decides something has to change. </p><p> </p><p>She spots a woman in a busy bar one evening, a redhead, not that it ever matters. The woman, Wanda (or was it Wendy?) is funny and charming and Rio finds that she doesn't particularly mind when Wanda decides to take the lead and draw her into a kiss. And it’s <em> okay… </em> But she doesn't kiss her like Agatha did, she doesn't make the same sounds as Agatha, doesn't feel like Agatha. When Rio goes home alone that night she curses Agatha’s name, even after just one night of sex, even if it was <em> stupidly hot sex </em>, the woman has left a scar on her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio could only assume the reason Agatha haunted her so much was down to the revealing of her true identity to the woman. A secret she hadn’t meant to spill, but her incessant need to be right overpowered her senses as she was lost in the moment of having Agatha coming undone by her hands (well strap) and there she was debating something as pointless as a simple translation, which of course Agatha was too smart to miss. Once she opened her mouth she seemingly couldn't stop herself from sharing, maybe it was just the relief of finally being able to share her secret, or just the look on Agatha’s face as she told her something seemingly impossible, but she had started to reveal truths no other human knew, just to make Agatha believe her. While she hadn’t given away much, the worst thing was, that she would have revealed the deepest darkest secrets of the universe if Agatha had only asked. </p><p> </p><p>And Agatha had left without so much of a goodbye while Rio slept.</p><p> </p><p>Death always has the final say. Why does Agatha think she is any different?</p><p> </p><p>When she finds herself outside the other woman’s office door late one afternoon, the tiny nags and questions that have been buzzing around her head suddenly stop at the sight of the fluorescent lights emitting from the crack in the door. Tonight she decides to skip knocking on the door and announcing her presence, stepping silently into the office just so can watch Agatha for a moment. </p><p> </p><p>The woman is leaning back in her desk chair, head tilted up to the ceiling with her eyes screwed shut and hands on her head, looking every bit the image of frustration. Her pristine white shirt is rolled up at the sleeves, exposing her forearms and Rio wants to lick them. Rio’s attention is quickly caught by the stark white document on the laptop sitting on the desk in front of her, radiating that mocking feeling Rio knows far too well.</p><p> </p><p>“What are you gonna do about the incorrect Fig fact then?” Rio’s voice fills the silent room and Agatha nearly falls out of her chair, a hand clutching at her metaphorical pearls as a handful of swear words spill from her mouth. Feigning casualness, despite bubbling emotions at finally being in the same space as the other woman, Rio leans against the door frame, “It's been keeping me up all night. Are you going to publish misinformation or reveal the fact that you have a more reliable source? Do you dare piss off the Greek academics?”</p><p> </p><p>“Hello, <em>Rio</em>.” Agatha sighs and Rio feels her jaw clench at the coldness being projected from the other woman. She wasn’t sure what she had expected from the other woman, but immediate coldness was not it, it wasn’t like she was the one to leave without a word. </p><p> </p><p>Well, two can play this game. </p><p> </p><p>“Dr Harkness,” She deadpans and doesn’t miss how Agatha’s eyes narrow at the term, she feels a smirk creep over her face at how easy it was to get some sort of reaction from her, despite how much the other woman tried to mask it. </p><p> </p><p>Pushing herself off the doorframe, she steps into the office, catching the corner of the door with her shoulder and knocking it wide open. Their eyes lock onto each other, a simmering silence burning hotter between them the closer she gets to Agatha. She can feel her pulse quicken, her breath growing fast and shallow, but Rio doesn’t miss how Agatha’s body mirrors her own. She watches the rise and fall of Agatha’s chest, her jaw clenching, nostrils flaring with an anger that makes Rio's insides bubble with excitement. </p><p> </p><p>By the time Rio’s in front of her desk, palms pressed flat and leaning against with the usual cockiness she carries herself with, she can practically hear Agatha’s molars grinding and she finds herself breaking into a grin, “So, you gonna include a chapter about fucking Lady Death?”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, stop it.” Agatha slams her laptop lid down, with more force than Rio thinks is necessary, “It was a bit of fun that night but it’s weird now. I mean… Is this some kink for you?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio chokes out a laugh, looking down at a scowling Agatha, “Seriously?!” </p><p> </p><p>“I’m not going to kink shame,” she holds her hands up in defeat, “But at least ask if I want to role-play.”</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Rio finds herself stumbling over words, thinking of something to say, but her mind draws blank, only able to mumble, “It's not a kink?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, so you’re just lying for the hell of it?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not lying… I’m The Green Witch, Lady Death, The River of <em> fucking </em>Life, I’m a real-life magical being!” She waves her hands above her hands above her head manically, before instantly regretting using the term ‘magical being’ to describe herself. </p><p> </p><p>“RIGHT, sure. Go on then.” Agatha gestures to the space in front of her desk, “Magic something, you real-life magical being!” </p><p> </p><p>Rio stares at her in disbelief, at the pure balls this woman had to just ask her to ‘magic something’. While, yes, it would put an immediate end to their current situation, Rio isn’t some performing monkey willing to do something on command. She’s <em> Death </em>, she helped form the universe and life. She pushes the thought that maybe if she had provided something a touch more in the sense of physical magic, rather than just facts and stories a little sooner they wouldn’t be in this mess. </p><p> </p><p>Anger creeps in and sweeps through her veins as she looks at an increasingly smug Agatha, as she refuses to rise to the challenge. A stalemate blossoms between the two of them, she takes a step back and crosses her arms over her chest, clenching her hands into fists, neither of them says anything, the heavy silence of the room is interrupted by their breaths and the occasional sound someone in a distant part of the building. Then something yields inside and Rio finds herself sprouting a small orchid in the palm of her hand. </p><p> </p><p>It takes another moment to pluck up the courage to show it to Agatha, knowing that once she opens up her hand the secret is out in the open between the two of them. And not only is it just anyone, it’s Agatha, an infuriating woman who also so happens to be writing a book on her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watches her expectantly, a triumphant look crossing her face at the fact she thinks she’s beaten Rio at her silly little game and that look gives her the final push to open the palm of her hand to reveal the small pink and green orchid. Agatha’s eyes drop from Rio’s face to the small flower, then flicker between looking at Rio and the flower, a slight frown crossing her face as she stands up and leans over the desk to examine the flower for a second, before looking disappointed.</p><p> </p><p>“Close-up magic, you really are just a creep.” Agatha deadpans and if Rio had blood pressure, she swears it would have just shot through the roof.</p><p> </p><p>“Close-up magic? Seriously?” Rio scoffs, “You think I just came prepared with a flower in case you happened to ask for me to magic up a plant?” She can hear the hysteria in her voice and feel the fragments of her sanity dispersing into the ether, the woman had just watched her pull a plant out of thin air and she mistakes her for a magician. Mistakes <em> Death </em> for a common charlatan. What more did she want?</p><p> </p><p>“I didn't ask you to summon a plant,” Agatha shrugs, walking around the desk and standing in front of Rio, “I just asked for magic.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio feels a low growl in her throat. Whether it’s in frustration or the fact that she’s just seen the figure-hugging pencil skirt that Agatha’s shirt is tucked into, she isn't sure. But she doesn’t let her eyes linger, not wanting to satisfy Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>“And really,” Agatha continues, a spiteful look crossing her face, “If I did ask for you to summon a plant, all you did was one tiny orchid?” Agatha plucks the flowers from her hand, pouting as she looks at it closer, looking neither impressed nor disgusted by it, discarding it on the desk behind her, stepping even closer. “I thought you were some universe-making deity, the mother of all death! At least impress me. Or are you really not <em> that </em> powerful?” </p><p> </p><p>Their eyes meet as Agatha says the last word and Rio hadn’t realised how close they were, how she can now feel the other woman’s breath on her skin, and hear her heart beating through her ribcage. Or how she could finally smell the other woman’s perfume now, the same rich floral scent as their first meeting, the same scent that lingered on her bedsheets, the same scent she had chased for the past month. But, the best thing about their close proximity, is she can see all of Agatha’s microexpressions she had been hiding behind a mask, Rio can see the slight tug of the corner of her mouth, she can see the flicker in her eyes that proves Agatha is enjoying whatever it is she’s doing. </p><p> </p><p>Which only goes to infuriate Rio even more. She isn't sure which is worse, Agatha not believing her, or Agatha not being the slightest bit scared of her and what she could do.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on, I’ve seen guys in twenty-dollar top hats at least summon a rabbit.” </p><p> </p><p>That's the final nail in the coffin. </p><p> </p><p>Rio fucking <em> hated </em> magicians. </p><p> </p><p>She doesn't think before she feels a burst of energy expelling from her body, pushing Agatha back against her desk as she crowds in, trying to use the extra few inches in height to make her seem more intimidating.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so fucking annoying,” Rio growls under her breath.</p><p> </p><p>“What are you gonna do about it?” And even after that, Agatha is still so unaffected. Rio glances at the open office door and holds her hand out in its direction, drawing energy from the room and flicking her wrist. A dramatic, and totally unnecessary flare of green shoots across the room as the door slams shut by itself, the sound echoing around the office. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes widen as she looks at the shut door, before turning back to Rio with a look of confusion. She watches as Agatha’s face cycles through about five different emotions, her eyes scanning over Rio’s face searching for answers to questions she hasn’t verbalised. But Rio can guess what they are, before she can even answer them, or even open her mouth to speak, Agatha lunges forward, her hands grabbing Rio’s face and pulling her into a rough desperate kiss. </p><p> </p><p>Teeth clash as they both try to control the kiss, despite their positions, Agatha somehow still seems to be at an advantage as she all but consumes Rio, a low moan slipping from her throat as she feels Rio’s tongue swipe across her lips. She steps into Agatha’s space, her hands gravitating to the other woman’s waist and grabbing at her shirt until she has handfuls of fabric, allowing her to pull Agatha further in, the heat of their bodies mingling as they press flush against each other. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha is the first to break the moment, pulling  away and panting for breath, “You really are, aren’t you?” </p><p> </p><p>“I’ve been trying to tell you that. If I knew all it took was shutting a door from ten feet away, I would have done it earlier.” </p><p> </p><p>“You’re the one who decided to sprout that tiny, stupid orchid.” </p><p> </p><p>“Fine, I’ll take it back then.” She reaches for the orchid lying on desk Agatha’s side but fingers wrap her wrist, stopping her in her tracks, “Oh, you’re feeling precious about it now, eh?” She grins, much to Agatha’s annoyance.</p><p> </p><p>“Shut up.” </p><p> </p><p>“Not until you admit that you found it charming.” </p><p> </p><p>“Charming?” Agatha scoffs, “A word of advice, women normally like it when you give them more than just one flower.”</p><p> </p><p>“Really?!” She feigns shock, pressing her free hand to her chest, “Thank you all knowledgeable one, I don’t know how I’ve made it this far without you.” She teases, trying to pull her hand from Agatha’s grip but the other woman’s hand tightens and brings her hand to her mouth, pressing a light kiss to the tips of Rio’s fingers.</p><p> </p><p>“I’d be happy to guide you through this modern world we find ourselves in.” She responds in an overly innocent tone and Rio rolls her eyes, only for her mouth to drop open as Agatha’s tongue flicks over the pads of her fingers. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re insufferable. A menace.” Rio admonishes her half-heartedly, hoping Agatha does anything but stop as she sucks her fingers into her mouth, her cheeks hollowing out, eyes fluttering shut, and all Rio can do is stare down, watching the brunette's face. “I haven’t been able to get you out of my mind.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes shoot open at the confession, and Rio herself is surprised at the rawness in her voice. Trying to reclaim the moment, she curls her fingers gently before slipping them from Agatha’s mouth, tracing them across her lower lip, watching the flesh drag. “Why did you leave?”</p><p> </p><p>“It… it was easier.” Agatha whispers, and Rio raises an eyebrow in a prompt to continue, “It was easier than having to face the fact you were lying and playing some twisted game that would leave me disappointed.”</p><p> </p><p>“You believed me?” Rio’s fingers trail down her jawbone, the soft skin of her neck, the line of her collarbone, resting on the top button of her shirt. Agatha nods. “And you aren’t scared of me?”</p><p> </p><p>The small head shake from Agatha is enough of a confirmation. Rio hadn’t realised it was something she had been waiting for, or needed, not only to tell her secret but to be <em> accepted </em>, not being the villain or feared, which is what usually happened in the person's remaining minutes between finding out and dying. </p><p> </p><p>Their mouths smash together, raw and delicious, teeth and tongue, hard and desperate. Agatha’s hands slide straight into Rio’s hair pulling her closer, while she attempts to avoid ripping the buttons of Agatha’s shirt open, just so she can get her mouth on her. The fabric opens enough and Rio’s mouth drops, planting open kisses to the space between her neck and collarbones, Agatha’s head tilts, letting her explore the area more, a groan leaving the back of her throat. </p><p> </p><p>Rio can taste the bitterness of her perfume, the salt of her sweat, and the sweetness of Agatha, it all drives her crazy. Her hands grab at the hem of Agatha’s skirt, hitching it around her hips before she lifts Agatha onto the desk, spreading her legs and standing in between them. She wastes no time pushing Agatha’s underwear to the side and <em> finally </em> being able to touch her again. There’s no teasing, as much as Rio wants to play and punish her for leaving that morning, they’re both too desperate, so instead Rio pushes two fingers into the wetness of Agatha’s cunt, taking pleasure in the strangled sound Agatha makes. </p><p> </p><p>Thighs wrap around her waist, pressing their bodies somehow even closer, trapping Rio’s arm between their bodies. The other slams onto the desk beside Agatha, as she finds herself off balance, leaning into the brunette’s body, providing some leverage as she fucks Agatha as roughly as the position allows. Hands grab at Rio desperately, nails biting into the skin of her arms and back through the fabric of her clothes. </p><p> </p><p>Her thumb ghosts across Agatha’s clit, causing the woman to cry out in pleasure at the feather-light touch, her hips bucking in the search for more contact, more pleasure. And who is Rio to refuse? Pressing down on the bundle of nerves, Agatha’s head shoots forward, her teeth latching onto Rio’s shoulder and biting down muffling a low growl. It only takes one well-timed curl of fingers before Agatha screams into her shoulder, teeth digging in enough to rip through the skin, her body shaking in pleasure as she comes around Rio’s fingers.</p><p> </p><p>The moment stretches out as they stay there, both unwilling to break the stillness, Agatha’s head rests on her shoulder, her breath tickling Rio’s neck as they let the unsettled heaviness overtake them. The silence is quickly shattered by a nearby door slamming shut, both women jumping, heads whipping around in the direction of the noise.  </p><p> </p><p>“Are people still around?” Rio steps back, putting the tiniest bit of distance between them.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, Rio. People are still around.” Agatha says like she stating the obvious, as if Rio should know the comings and goings of everyone in the college.</p><p> </p><p>“Shall we get out of here then?”</p><p> </p><p>“My office hours are still open for another,” Agatha twists her body looking at the clock on her wall, “45 minutes.”</p><p> </p><p>“Are you kidding me?” Rio looks at the other woman dumbfounded, unable to believe that she is worrying about something so meager as <em> office hours </em> when they could be in bed together. Or anywhere else for that matter. </p><p> </p><p>But Agatha just shakes her head. She hopes it's some joke and waits another second for Agatha to crack, but she doesn't, her face remaining stony and serious. Rio sighed, a playful smile tugging on her lip, “When was the last time you had a student come to office hours?” </p><p> </p><p>She holds her breath as she waits for a response, praying that Agatha won’t take it the wrong way and that she remembers telling Rio about how disastrous her office hours ended up, with only the occasional student turning up for a meeting that would have her preferring dental surgery without anaesthetic. </p><p> </p><p>“Fine,” Agatha relents with a sigh, “But if I miss ONE student-” </p><p> </p><p>“I will write them a personal apology. Now shall we?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pushes her back and slides off the desk, Rio has to hide her chuckle when Agatha’s legs buckle under her. Much to her amusement, Agatha tries to disguise it by tugging at her clothes to make herself look somewhat presentable, finishing it off by flicking her hair over her shoulder with a level of drama unnecessary for the moment. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha clears her throat and looks at Rio expectantly, “So, do we have to walk out of here or do you just click your fingers?” </p><p> </p><p>“Abusing the power already, Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p>“Come onnnnn.” Agatha drawls, stepping back into Rio’s space, hands playing with the neckline of her top with a pout, “Are you telling me you walk everywhere?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolls her eyes, “Fine, but if something happens to you and they look back on CCTV they can’t track you? Well, I’m not going back to jail.” </p><p> </p><p>“You’re so dramatic-” </p><p> </p><p>Rio cuts her off mid bitchy comment, planting a hand on Agatha’s waist and absorbs the energy in the room, ripping them through the fabric of space with a harsh snap until they appear in the middle of the kitchen in Rio’s apartment, only a few centimetres from where she had dropped to her knees the last time they were here together. </p><p> </p><p>“What the fuck was that?” Agatha’s face is a picture of distraught, and two shades paler than it had been before. Maybe Rio should have warned her or prepared her slightly, she hadn’t ‘travelled’ with a human before, but she knew it was unlike anything the woman would have experienced before; in Rio’s defence, however, (which was very wafer thin) Agatha had provoked her. </p><p> </p><p>“And you said I’m the dramatic one.” Rio teases, pulling a chair out for Agatha, who sits down, her face still a picture of confusion. “It takes a while to get used to, I would imagine anyway, I’ve never given anyone the privilege of that before.” </p><p> </p><p>“So you’ve never done that before? With someone?” Agatha asks suspiciously like Rio would lie to her for no reason, or even worse, she thinks Rio is trying to make her feel special. </p><p> </p><p>“No, why would I?” </p><p> </p><p>“You mean you’re telling me no one else you’ve told has ever asked for an instant Uber?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio tries her hardest not to laugh at the seriousness of the other woman, that one of the first and major things she has an issue with after finding out about her being Lady Death is that she might be lying about ‘travelling’ with other people. </p><p> </p><p>This <em> fucking </em> woman was going to be her undoing. </p><p> </p><p>“I wasn’t lying when I said I didn’t tell people, that also means I don’t give people,” she uses exaggerated air quotes, “<em> an instant Uber. </em>”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha mumbles something about it ‘being hard to believe’ and Rio finds herself biting her tongue to stop herself from arguing back about something so stupid, even as the other woman crosses her arms and scowls up at her. Agatha was intent on never trusting a word Rio said as if she would benefit from lying to her. </p><p> </p><p>She lets the silence stretch out for a moment before she leans against the table and picks up an apple from the bowl in the middle of it, spinning it in her hand looking for any imperfections; all while Agatha watches her wearing that scrutinising expression that Rio hates to admit sets her skin on edge.</p><p> </p><p>“What is your game here?”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh?” </p><p> </p><p>“Do you want me to <em> not </em>publish and do my lectures? What is the whole thing?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio cackles, she doesn't mean to let it slip out but once it starts she can’t stop, “I mean…” she looks at the other woman, a less than thrilled look crossing her face at Rio’s amusement that she cares all that much. “Unless you changed the ending to include a photo and my address then you can do whatever you want to,” she leans towards Agatha, “I’m sure you will anyway.”</p><p> </p><p>“And if I did? What if I dropped your exact address? What would you do?” A cruel smile crosses her face that sends a thrill down her spine straight to the arousal that’s been building between her legs ever since she pinned Agatha against her desk in her office.</p><p> </p><p>She holds Agatha’s eye contact, a silent challenge, and she has no doubt Agatha would publish all her private information just out of spite. Finally, she brings the apple to her lips and takes a slow bite, her teeth ripping through the flesh of the fruit with ease. She chews the fruit slowly, savouring the taste as her own mouth forms a cruel grin that rivals Agatha’s.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, sweetheart, I’d walk you to the afterlife myself.” She takes another bite of apple and lets the juice trickle down her chin. Rio watches as Agatha’s pupils dilate and her breath hitches, but the burn of a challenge doesn't fall away from her eyes, instead, she reaches up and swipes it away with her thumb roughly, bringing it to her own lips and licking the juice away.</p><p> </p><p>“Perfect.” </p><p> </p><p>The apple is quickly discarded as Agatha stands, her chair skidding back as she grabs Rio and pulls her into a kiss that leaves her no choice but to forget about everything but the woman in front of her, who begins to practically drag her out the kitchen and down the hall. </p><p> </p><p>Rio comes on Agatha’s fingers, straddling her lap whispering filthy confessions into the air. Agatha on her part stays quiet, her mouth closed around Rio’s breast, sucking and kissing marks onto the olive skin. Her hips grind down, taking the pleasure Agatha is so willingly giving her, chasing her orgasm that when teeth clamp around her nipple a silent scream leaves her mouth as she comes hard. </p><p> </p><p>Yet Agatha doesn’t stop there, rolling them over, fucking her into the mattress with promises of making her come on her cock that quickly sends Rio hurtling into her next orgasm leaving her feeling exhausted and wrung out. She pulls Agatha into a loose, skin-slick hug, as she catches her breath. They lie like that for a moment, their breaths evening out and Rio wonders if sleep has taken Agatha, and if she dares to join her if she will be alone when she wakes.</p><p> </p><p>In the end, fear wins, and instead, she stares at the ceiling, watching the shadows grow as the night darkens and stillness takes over.</p><p> </p><p>“Surely you must be busy?” Agatha breaks the peace, the words have Rio wracking her brain for what conversation this is continuing, but in the end, she draws up a blank and makes a confused noise in Agatha’s direction. The other woman sighs, annoyed that Rio can’t read her mind and rolls onto her side to face her, propping her head up with her hand and looking far too at home in the bed. “You’re <em> Death </em>and you’re doing a PhD, I mean how do you have the time?”</p><p> </p><p>And <em> oh, </em> that’s what she means. </p><p> </p><p>Rio huffs out a laugh, unable to stop the smile spreading across her face as Agatha’s eyes widen and her face turns a cute shade of red.</p><p> </p><p>“You weren’t serious about the PhD were you?” Agatha hides her face with her hands in embarrassment.</p><p> </p><p>“No, I’m doing a PhD.” She states, not revealing more than she needs to until she’s prompted, seeping all the enjoyment out of this moment as possible.</p><p> </p><p>“Wait but don’t you have... I don't know… souls to reap?” Agatha’s hands fall from her face revealing a dubious expression, as 2 plus 2 makes 5 in her mind.</p><p> </p><p>“Woah, That’s such an antiquated view,” Rio mocks offence, “I have people that work for me, you know? Don’t write about that,” she quips, shooting her a serious look, “People will think I’m less impressive if they know I outsource the work.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nods, and Rio can see the cogs in her brain turning until she gets to the obvious roadblock “So you decided to fill your time by… going to college?” </p><p> </p><p>“Mhmmm, I was bored.” Rio grabs one of Agatha’s hands, tracing the lifeline on her palm. “People think they want to live forever, but the reality is- well it’s not as glamorous as it seems.” She pushes the thoughts of loneliness always at the edge of her mind to the back, focusing on the brief comfort she is experiencing at the moment instead. “Saw some vampires go to college and stuff, give them some purpose. Figured I would give it a go”</p><p> </p><p>“Vampires are real?” Agatha gawps, her eyes all but lighting up and Rio can’t help the laugh that spills from her lips at her reaction, and that <em> vampires </em> are what she chose to take away from it.</p><p> </p><p>“No, I watched <em> Twilight </em>, don’t be ridiculous, sweetheart.” Rio rolls her eyes, earning a shove from the other woman. “Are vampires real? Seriously?! Come on Agatha, I thought-” </p><p> </p><p>“Okay, okay shut up.” Agatha silences her by pressing a hand over her mouth. “It’s not the most absurd question.” Rio manages to mumble about sparkly skin and turning into bats, not that Agatha is able to understand through the barrier of the hand, which presses down harder as she tries to talk again, her other hand prodding at Rio’s waist, making her squirm and giving Agatha the easy advantage to push her onto her back and straddle her hips.</p><p> </p><p>Rio licks the palm of her hand in retort and Agatha pulls her hand back with a sound of disgust, giving Rio enough of a chance to try and reverse their positions. But Agatha catches on and grabs her wrists, pressing them in the mattress. </p><p> </p><p>“Sorry, am I meant to believe you’re the only immortal being out there then?” </p><p> </p><p>“No one escapes death, Agatha Harkness.” She puts on her most over-the-top spooky voice and wags her eyebrows, “Not even the blood drinkers with oversized teeth.” Rio takes the opportunity as Agatha begins to defend herself to free her hands and flip their positions, pinning Agatha into the bed instead, whispering a half threat, a half promise of, “I come for everyone in the end.” </p><p> </p><p>“So everyone dies in the end?” The playfulness drops from Agatha’s tone, a clear shift in the air as Rio has to remind the woman of her mortality. </p><p> </p><p>“Yes. I can offer only time to those who deserve it.” The last part slips out before she can stop it, the effect of the other woman, the fear that she would spill all the secrets to her if only she asked come true. It was the first time she had admitted to another soul and she feared somehow saying it aloud meant she could no longer hide from the fact.</p><p> </p><p>“How do you decide who gets more time?” She presses, and Rio takes a breath as she sits back, loosening her grip on the woman underneath her, knowing the conversation is much more suited for a different situation. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t. I can’t. It’s… I don’t mess with the natural order.” She answers simply, a sharpness to her voice that hopefully ends the topic and Agatha tilts her head, her eyes scanning over Rio’s face as she seemingly understands that there is more to this than Rio cares to talk about. </p><p> </p><p>A smile creeps across Agatha’s face before she pouts and bats her eyelids, “Not even for little old me?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio scoffs a laugh, shaking her head, pressing her back into the mattress, “Especially not you. You’re too much work.”</p><p> </p><p>“Moi?” Agatha fakes an exaggerated shock, rolling her hips upwards and Rio chuckles, “How dare you?! We’ve only just met.”</p><p> </p><p>“Exactly. I can tell you’re going to exhaust me already.”</p><p> </p><p>—-</p><p> </p><p>Rio Vidal would never call herself a narcissist or an attention seeker. It’s why only Gaea is mentioned as the creator of life. It’s why she took such care to change her appearance and characteristics depending on the culture and time period. </p><p> </p><p>Rio Vidal liked being incognito. </p><p> </p><p>But there’s something about sitting in the back of a lecture watching Dr Agatha Harkness educate an entire room on her. Or the hypothetical entity of Death. </p><p> </p><p>She had been planning on staying quiet, watching, but she couldn’t resist the urge to hold her hand up at the final moment in the Q&amp;A. She saw the moment Agatha spotted her, a smirk crossing her face and Rio knew she was going to bite at the challenge. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha knew her well enough to know that Rio would never out herself anyway. </p><p> </p><p>“Yes, the woman at the back in the green jumper” Agatha points and a grad student Rio has learnt is called Billy runs up a few stairs and holds a microphone over to her. </p><p> </p><p>“Hi, I’m Rio, a fascinating lecture by the way, especially the part on the Greek dialects and discovering alternative translations.” She smiles gently, biting back a laugh at Agatha as her eyes widen comically, “So you say Lady Death is real, has been around since like forever… so by that logic, is she still with us?” </p><p> </p><p>There are a few mutters from the audience and Agatha’s brows shoot up. </p><p> </p><p>“Well, I suppose yes…” her face brightens, biting at the challenge, “With the logic we have that links her to The Green Witch, that we discovered in the Salem documents, and have proof she exists. Then yes, she is alive and could be walking the earth. I mean, depending on the size of her ego, she could even be in this room.” </p><p> </p><p>There’s a laugh from the audience and Agatha seems proud of herself, her eyes locking onto Rio’s daring her to say something back and she can’t help but smile. </p><p> </p><p>“And… sorry, quick follow-up question, if you don’t mind.” </p><p> </p><p>“No, please continue,” Agatha responds with all the grace and composure of the perfect public speaker, despite complaining about follow-up questions that very morning.</p><p> </p><p>“If she was in this room, what would you say to her?” </p><p> </p><p>“I’d say, I have some questions, shall we go for a drink?”</p>
