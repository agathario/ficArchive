<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>The Witches Road ski resort is home to some of the best skiing in the country and some of the best instructors. Ski instructor Agatha and Snowboarding Instructor Rio have a friendly (boarder line dangerous) rivalry on and off the mountain. Agatha likes to show up a competitive Rio, while Rio likes to spend every moment she can, making Agatha's days a little more difficult.</p><p>————</p><p>Rio sits herself down at the top of the run, leaning over to secure her feet in her bindings while Agatha has already clicked herself into hers.</p><p>“Hurry up!” Agatha whines, whacking Rio’s helmet with her pole.</p><p>Rio whips around, reaching out and shoving her ski so she slips a little. “Be patient, asshole.”</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha is making her way through the town of the famous ski resort, The Witches Road. Her ski boots are slung over the shoulder, the incessant clicking of her bindings making her presence deafeningly known. There are only a few other people walking around, each of them clearly early risers, trying to secure their spot as some of the first to break the day's freshly fallen snow. She makes her way into a coffee shop where her order is already waiting for her.</p><p>“Supposed to be beautiful today.” The barista says with a bright smile on her face. She always says that, no matter what the weather actually looks like, she says it.</p><p>Agatha doesn't acknowledge it, she simply says “Thanks.” and takes her coffee. She walks around the town for a little longer, more and more people begin trickling in, the sound of ski boots, and clicking snowboard bindings filling her ears. After checking the time, she heads over to the ski school building where she’s greeted by her boss, Lilia, who is helping parents check their kids in for the day.</p><p>Agatha makes her way back to her locker, half smiling at the people she passes. She would never pay them a second glance until last season when Lillia told her to be friendlier or she would start giving her the three year olds.</p><p>As she gets ready, she can already sense a familiar presence.</p><p>“Good morning!” Her colleague Alice chimes as she walks into the room. “Gorgeous day!”</p><p>Agatha, already annoyed, nods, “Mhm.”</p><p>“Hey, I’ll ask the others too but do you wanna hit a few runs after our lessons?” She asks.</p><p>“Maybe.” Agatha answers, stepping into her boots.</p><p>“I’m down!” The other woman, Jen, chimes in.</p><p>“Siiick!”</p><p>Agatha ignores the two of them. While she has joined them on a few of their after work runs, she usually passes them up. She prefers to have her time skiing to herself. She already has to sacrifice her time teaching uncoordinated brats how to stay upright, why let her co-workers slow her down?</p><p>Once she’s gotten nearly completely ready, finally clipping on her helmet, she reaches to pull out her skis and poles but her poles are nowhere to be found.</p><p>The woman pauses, not even considering the idea that she left them somewhere yesterday. She clenches her jaw and inhales deeply through her nose. “Rio!” She yells, slowly turning around, waiting until a woman with dark brown hair rounds the corner and turns her attention towards her.</p><p>“Yes?” She asks innocently, lazily leaning against her locker door, her arms crossed casually across her chest.</p><p>“Where are my poles?”</p><p>“I don’t know.” She shrugs, pulling a wicked grin onto her face.<br/>
Agatha huffs and stomps past her, shoving her out of the way so she can begin digging through her locker.</p><p>“They’re not in there.” Rio sing-songs, still allowing the woman to continue.</p><p>Agatha huffs again, whipping around. “Where did you put them?”</p><p>“Whatever do you mean?” She gasps, placing a hand to her chest. Agatha sinks her teeth into her bottom lip, trying her best to keep her composure.</p><p>She turns to Jen. “Where’d she put them?”</p><p>Jen keeps her head down, quickly replying, “No. Not a part of this.” She continues on pulling on her gear.</p><p>Agatha turns to the other woman. “Alice?”</p><p>“Why would I know?”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, returning her gaze to Rio who still has that stupid grin on her face.</p><p>“C’mon we have to go check in, just give them to me.” She holds her hand out but Rio doesn’t move. “Or I can go tell Lillia that you’re keeping me from getting my kids for the day.” She threatens, which makes Rios' smile drop into an annoyed scowl.</p><p>“You’re no fun.” She groans, rounding the corner to retrieve the sticks that she poorly hid.</p><p>“Thank you.” Agatha snatches them out of her hands, causing that stupid grin to return to Rio's face as her goal to piss her off was clearly accomplished.</p><p>“I hope you’re stuck on the magic carpet all day.” Agatha “insults” her as she leaves the locker room, clenching her jaw when she hears Rio lightly chuckle behind her.</p><p>When Agatha gets to the front desk, Lilia is waiting with her daily stack of papers.</p><p>“Agatha…” She rifles through the papers. “You will have five kids today, five and six year olds, all their third lesson.” Lilia hands the woman her list. Agatha shrugs, not a horrible group to get. They’ll at least be able to stay standing.</p><p>“And Rio!” Agatha can feel the energy shift as the woman appears next to her. “You also have five kids, between eight and ten, all intermediate.”</p><p>“Yes!” Rio pumps a fist in the air, snatching up her list. She turns to Agatha, sticking her tounge out at the woman, who reaches up, quickly pushing Rios goggles off her helmet so they’re dangling behind her.</p><p>Lilia shakes her head at the pair. “Maybe the two of you should separate before you get in line.” She suggests, turning to give the rest of the team their lists for the day.</p><p>Rio keeps eye contact as she reaches up to pull her dangling goggles back over her helmet, laughing at Agatha's attempt to piss her off which only pisses Agatha off more.</p><p>“See you out there.” Rio smiles, heading off. Agatha simply shakes her head, waiting until Rio is far enough away before also going to get her kids.</p><p>In line for the Gondola, Agatha is carrying three extra pairs of baby skis, along with her own.</p><p>She’s tried her best to stay away from Rio but sure enough, she hears from behind her, “Wow Agatha, I didn’t know you were so strong!” Rio calls, flexing with her free hand.</p><p>Agatha ignores her, shifting so the skies are a little more comfortable in her arms. She sighs in relief when the next group goes and it’s finally their turn to load in.</p><p>“Okay guys, go to that one.” She tells her kids who all waddle their way over to the next open gondola. Just as she sits down she locks eyes with Rio through the open doors. She isn’t doing anything, but the condescending smile on her face fills her with anger for no other reason than the fact that it’s Rio.</p><p>Once they make it to the top of the lift, Agatha guides the kids over to the top of the learning hill. She helps each of them click into their bindings and makes sure their boots are fitted properly before she begins the lesson.</p><p>Meanwhile, Rio is also at the top, getting her kids ready to go down the bigger run to their right.</p><p>“Hey guys listen up.” Rio grabs the attention of her kids. “That's my friend, Coach Agatha.” She points to where Agatha has her kids all about to start heading off. “Everyone get a snowball.” She tells them and all five of them scrape up as much snow as they can, each of them making themselves a snowball, Rio making herself three.</p><p>“Anyone who hits coach Agatha, I’ll buy you hot chocolate at lunch.” She offers the kids who all frantically agree to the deal. “Okay, after you throw it, meet me at that slow sign.” She points down to the neon orange sign at the end of the first hill. She then stands up and pushes off, waving for the kids to go ahead of her so she can watch. As they near Agatha, they all gear up, each of them chucking their snowball at the woman. Agatha lets out a disgruntled scream as almost all of them hit her. When Rio pulls up, she’s cackling as she chucks her three, two of them hitting her helmet and one landing her square in the chest.</p><p>“RIO!” Agatha screams after the woman who quickly picks up speed, following after her kids. She sees her kids a ways down where they all sat to wait for her, all of them laughing to each other.</p><p>“Well done guys!” Rio cheers as she stops on her knees just below where they all decided to sit. “Everyone gets hot chocolate for that!” She high-fives each of them.</p><p>Rio looks back up the hill in hopes of seeing a pissed off Agatha fighting the urge to abandon her students and come barrelling after her but she’s not there.</p><p>“Okay team, I'm gonna go ahead of you, see what we’re working with.” She tells the kids who all roll over so they’re also on their knees, ready to stand up. “I’ll stop just before the turn and you’ll each come down one at a time and wait for me at the next split. Okay?”</p><p>They all chime their “okay’s” and Rio hops up, quickly taking off. The kids all marvel at her skills as she shreds her way down the mountain.</p><p>“Are you okay coach Agatha!?” One little girl frantically asks as Agatha dusts the snow off of herself.</p><p>“Yeah.” She huffs, looking to where she saw the snowboarder go but she’s already disappeared over the edge.</p><p>“That was just my friend messing with me.” She would never call Rio a friend but saying that is much easier than explaining the last two seasons of nonsensical harassing each other for, honestly, no reason.</p><p>“I’ll get her back later.” Agath assures her, lightly tapping the kid's leg with her ski pole. “In the meantime, let's get you guys skiing!” She cheers, followed by little voices all whooping after her.</p><p>Two and a half hours later, Agatha leads her kids into the lodge and back to the ski school eating area where she see’s none other than Rio sat at a table with her kids. “Jen, watch my kids for a sec.” She tells the woman before she stomps her way over, slamming her helmet onto the table, trying to startle Rio but she doesn’t even flinch, slowly turning her attention towards the woman.</p><p>“Oh look who it is guys! Coach Agatha! You guys can thank her for the hot chocolate!” She beams and the kids all laugh and say their thank you’s.</p><p>“Rio.” Agtha says in a quiet but sharp tone. “You cannot use the kids to mess with me.”</p><p>“What do you mean? It was just a friendly snowball fight.” She shrugs. “What? Shocked you got some snow on you?” She leans in, lifting her chin, and batting those big brown eyes. “I know you <em> never </em> fall.” Her tone is light and mocking. “What do we say guys?”</p><p>Her kids all speak in unison. “If you’re not falling. you’re not trying!” They yell, causing Rio to smile proudly.</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes at the saying that Rio teaches every single group of kids she gets. She considers snapping back for a moment but instead she simply huffs and walks back over to where Jen has all of the kids waiting to get their lunch.</p><p>“She is just the absolute worst!” Agatha tries to suppress it but she ends up letting out a disgruntled scream.</p><p>“Yeah yeah.” Jen waves, all too used to hearing about how annoying Rio is just about every day. “Y’know you guys shouldn’t flirt in front of your students.”</p><p>“What?” Agath snaps her head to look at the woman.</p><p>“It’s weird, you gotta stop.” She says casually, helping a kid with her gloves.</p><p>Agatha’s jaw drops. “We’re not flirting.”</p><p>“Psh okay yeah, right.”</p><p>“We’re not! She just enjoys making my life fucking difficult as shit.” She grumbles.</p><p>Jen slaps Agatha's arm with a loose glove. “Language!”</p><p>Agatha throws her hands up in mock surrender, bugging her eyes, choosing to move on from the conversation. She looks back at Rio who is currently pulling on one of her kids goggles, making them all erupt into adorable laughter at how small and weird they look on her.</p><p>“Rio.” Alice calls, gaining the woman's attention, also making her laugh when she looks at Rio with the tiny goggles.</p><p>“You wanna hit a few runs once we’re done here?” She asks, gesturing around to the kids.</p><p>“Better idea.” Rio points. “Let's see if Jen and Agatha are down for a race. I just waxed by board and I am on a roll with Agatha today.” She grins, sitting back in her chair.</p><p>Alice playfully rolls her eyes. “Okay.” She agrees, going over to ask the women.</p><p>Rio watches as Alice approaches them. A few seconds later, her eyes meet Agatha’s. She’s glaring back suspiciously while Alice continues talking, probably airing her out, she knows. She finally see’s Agatha nodding her head to agree and Rio blows her a kiss just before the other woman forces herself to look away.</p><p>That afternoon, once they’ve all dropped their kids back off at the building and are free for the remainder of the afternoon, Agatha finds Rio outside, twirling a single one of her poles in her hands.</p><p>“How was your day?” She innocently asks.</p><p>“Fine.” Agatha snatches the stick out of her hand, gathering the rest of her things as they wait for the other two.</p><p>“Anything exciting happen?”</p><p>“Other than the five fantastic hours where I didn’t have to hear your grading voice? No, not really.” She tilts her head, watching Rio fight the urge to snap back at her.</p><p>“You gotta give it to me, those were some great shots.” She throws her arms out, waiting for the praise for her snowball prank.</p><p>“You were five feet away from me, with barely any speed. The kids all hit me too, it wasn’t that impressive.” She knocks her down a few pegs.</p><p>“But If you can hit me during this run, then I'll give you all the praise you want, big boy.” Agatha mocks her, patting her cheek, making Rio clench her jaw, her eyes flickering with something she can’t quite read.</p><p>“C’mon you freaks, let's go!” Alice and Jen finally emerge from the building and they head off again.</p><p>Once they’re on the lift, Alice reaches up, pulling the bar down over their heads.</p><p>“What the fuck? Why are you pulling the bar down?” Rio asks as she checks to make sure her legs are out of the way.</p><p>“We need to look at the map.” Alice tells her.</p><p>Rio scoffs. “When was the last time we looked at the map?”</p><p>“Hey, you don’t have to but I'm making sure I have the best route down.” Alice yanks off her glove and begins pointing. “Alright so when we get off, we’ll take Drifter over to the backcountry lift. Then we’ll start in the back bowl and after that it’s simply whoever gets to the north base first.” She pats the map, sitting back contently.</p><p>“Here, this run would be good for you Agatha.” Rio reaches across, pointing to the one and only blue run off the top of the bowl.</p><p>“Good idea! It’ll give you a chance to be able to keep up!” She shoots back, the two of them half scowling, half smiling at one another.</p><p>“Can you two dial it back for at least the ride?” Jen asks, clearly annoyed by their constant back and forth.</p><p>Alice leans over to Jen, mumbling. “Imagine how annoying they’re gonna be if one of them wins.”</p><p>“Oh no.” Jen gasps. “We gotta beat them.”</p><p>At the top of the lift, as they all begin to unload, once Agatha is up and going, she quickly reaches out, shoving Rio.</p><p>Rio yelps as she’s set off balance but is able to catch herself before she falls over and they have to stop the lift.</p><p>“Agatha!” Jen snaps at the woman who is simply cackling as Rio hobbles her way over to the other three.</p><p>“Agatha! You can’t do that!” Jen continues.</p><p>“Oh c’mon! She’s fine!” She throws her hands up. “We’re off the clock. At least I respect that.” Agatha retorts, shading Rio for continuing to harass her even when she has ten kids to look after.</p><p>“I keep it slope friendly.” Rio says, clicking her last binding tight before hopping to her feet, slowly sliding backwards, locking eyes with Agatha before she pulls her goggles on. “You better watch your back though.” She points, taking off down the run to the next lift.</p><p>“When you two get fired, don’t say we didn’t warn you.” Jen says, following after the woman.</p><p>Alice simply shrugs at Agatha before the two of them head off too.</p><p>Rio got too big of a lead for Agatha to catch up but she can clearly see her, going up the side jumps, not catching too much air but still enough to prove that she has some skills.</p><p>Agatha opts to straight line it, just to be sure that Rio has little room to make fun of her for being “Slow”.</p><p>At the bottom, they all slide into line where they barely have to wait until they’re on the next chair. The ride up is mostly quiet except for the guy they see, looking great until he catches an edge and wipes out. They all whoop and holler, throwing their hands around wildly, getting louder when he victoriously throws his own hands up.</p><p>“Not falling, not trying.” Rio says, eyeing Agatha who just rolls her eyes back at her, not that she can see them under her goggles.</p><p>They unload with Rio safe from Agatha's fury as Jen and Alice made sure to sit between them this time.</p><p>Alice and Rio skate over to the side and strap in, hopping up onto their feet.</p><p>“Alright, see y’all at the base.” Alice salutes them and they all take off down the mountain. The open bowl allows the three of them to stay together for a while but eventually, the run splits and they all head off down their preferred trail. Agatha and Alice take the same trail while Rio and Jen disappear somewhere else. Agatha is so laser focused on the race that she loses track of Alice, unsure if she’s behind or infront of her.</p><p>After about two minutes, she gets to a steep blue, bordering on black. She skis like normal at the top, calculated turns that keep up her speed. Then when she gets closer to the end, she moves to straight line as she’s fully aware of the snowboarder's nightmare ahead of her, an annoyingly long flat. She rounds the corner with enough speed that she easily passes the first section and the people who were not aware or not confident enough to keep up their speed. The second part is where it gets people. She can already see a few skiers pushing themselves with their poles, and snowboarders trying their best to gain some momentum while others have given up entirely and are walking themselves the rest of the way. She looks ahead where she sees a familiar green helmet, jerking their weight back and forth in an awkward hobble.</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha calls. Rio whips around where she see’s Agatha holding out a pole, offering to tow her the rest of the way down the flat. She gets infront of her and just as Rio is about to get ahold of it, Agatha yanks it away, quickly pushing off, cackling as she watches Rio try and keep from falling over.</p><p>“Fuck you!” She calls, falling hard onto her butt.</p><p>“See ya!” Agatha yells back.</p><p>When she gets to the bottom, she quickly gets into the singles line where she immediately hops onto a chair, looking back to see Rio now running with her board in hand.</p><p>She laughs to herself as the people next to her just ignore her. She wastes no time getting off the lift, quickly moving on to the second to last run where she spots Alice who must’ve been just two chairs ahead of her.</p><p>“I thought you were behind me!” Agatha yells as she passes her. “Oh look! You are!” She mocks the woman who takes the challenge, going even faster.</p><p>They both make it to the next lift at the same time, pulling into the slightly more trafficked line when suddenly Rio skates up next to them.</p><p>“Fuck you!” She yells the second she gets there. ”You’re playing dirty!” She points.</p><p>“You didn’t grab it in time.” Agatha innocently shrugs. “Not my fault you were too scared to keep your speed up.”</p><p>“I was not scared, I just forgot, I haven’t taken anyone back here in awhile.” She defends herself.</p><p>“Excuses excuses.” Agatha tsks. “Can I get in here with you?” She asks the group of three that are now next to her, securing her spot on the next chair.</p><p>At the top of the final run, she quickly weighs her options, choosing to go right and hit all of the blacks as that would require the least amount of ground to cover.</p><p>Surprisingly, just as she's about to get going, she looks to see Jen unloading from a different lift, completely unaware of Agatha as she immediately takes off.</p><p>Agatha heads down the next run, careful to avoid the crowd of people still at the top. She hits one black, quickly maneuvering her way down. Then on the next one, she’s going down like normal when one unexpected bump sets her off balance and she falls. Luckily, she doesn't hit hard enough for her skis to pop off and as soon as she catches her breath, she’s off again. Rio was right, she was definitely trying and she definitely fell.</p><p>At the end of the runs, it opens up to the main run that everyone must hit in order to get to the base. She scans the jackets around and below her, looking to see if anyone beat her down and sure enough, Alice somehow managed to get ahead of her but Jen and Rio are nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Once she gets close enough to the bottom, she aims for where Alice is victoriously shaking her arms in the air, jumping up and down as she already took off her board. Agatha skates to a hard stop, lightly spraying the woman with snow.</p><p>“I won!” Alice cheers, playfully pushing Agatha.</p><p>“Yeah yeah.” Agatha grumbles. “At least you’re not Rio.”</p><p>Alice laughs. “I don’t get it with you two. It’s not about her! I beat YOU!” She yells, smiling wide as Agatha pops out of her bindings.</p><p>“Nice job, you killed it.” Agatha finally admits. They both look up the mountain, each of them quickly spotting the other two who are neck and neck for third place. Rio makes it to the two of them just before Jen does.</p><p>“Loser!” Agatha yells at Rio, holding her gloved hand into an L shape on the front of her helmet. “I even fell and you couldn’t catch up!” She forcefully laughs, taking some of the snow from her hood, chucking it at the woman.</p><p>“Whatever.” Rio huffs. “It was that road.”</p><p>“Why would you take the road?” Alice asks.</p><p>“I didn’t know!” Rio defends herself.</p><p>“That's okay sweetie.” Agatha mocks, jutting out a lip. “It’s not your fault you don’t know the mountain.”</p><p>“I know the mountain! I just thought I was on a different run!”</p><p>“Give it up man.” Jen pats her back. “We can try this again tomorrow if you're such a sore loser but as of right now, our reigning champion is Alice!” The two of them cheer, Agatha joining in with extra enthusiasm, sure to keep her eyes locked on Rio.</p><p>Once they’ve all returned their gear to their lockers, they all head outside to go home. Jen and Alice walk off together, simply waving good-bye to the other two women.</p><p>“Feels good to fall huh?” Rio asks.</p><p>“It’s not as easy for us skiers to get up but, yeah, I recovered.” She answers.</p><p>The pair simply looks back at one another. Agatha's eyes flicker over Rio’s face, landing on her frizzy hair, sticking out from under her beanie. Rio on the other hand, is looking at Agatha’s slightly sunburnt cheeks, her goggles making for a hilarious but familiar tanline.</p><p>Rio simply pulls another smug grin onto her face. “See you tomorrow Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha inhales deeply, forcing herself to keep from smiling back. “Unfortunately.” She sighs, spinning around on her heel, waiting until she’s sure Rio can’t see her before finally letting a smile creep onto her face.<br/>

<p>When Agatha walks into the coffee shop, there is a lot more commotion than usual. “Sorry Agatha, we’re running a little late on the employee Coffees today.” The barista apologises when she spots the woman at the counter. “Give me just a few minutes.” She holds up a finger, giving Agatha no choice but to step back and wait.</p><p>“Well good morning coach Agatha.” She hears a familiar voice chime. When she turns her head, it’s of course Rio standing right next to her.</p><p>Agatha scoffs. “Since when do you get here at the same time as me?”</p><p>“Since, I felt like it today.” She replies, flashing a grin.</p><p>“Well I'm not on the clock so I don’t have to talk to you until nine so…” She shoos her away.</p><p>“Okay.” Rio simply shrugs, although she doesn't step any further away.</p><p>Agatha tries her best to ignore her but she can feel the woman inching herself closer and closer until their shoulders are touching. Agatha turns to look at her.</p><p>“Not talking.” Rio chimes, keeping her eyes straight ahead.</p><p>Agatha inhales deeply, she knows exactly what Rio wants. She refuses to give it to her so they just stand there, shoulder to shoulder until their orders are ready.</p><p>“Sorry about the wait.” The girl winces as she hands them their coffees.</p><p>“It’s fine.” Agatha tells her, quickly leaving while Rio is busy loading her coffee with sugar and milk. She doesn't get very far before Rio is jogging up next to her, still refusing to say a word, which is somehow more annoying.</p><p>When they walk into the locker room, both Jen and Alice brace to hear the pair arguing. But they instead share a confused look when the two of them seem to be ignoring one another.</p><p>“You guys good?” Alice asks.</p><p>“What? No yeah, just shared a lovely peaceful walk together actually.” Rio throws on an overly joyful smile. “What time is it?”</p><p>“Nine o’five.” She answers.</p><p>“You hear that Agatha? You’re on the clock!” Rio yells over her shoulder to the woman who is still ignoring her, but she hears the hint of an annoyed huff.</p><p>Once they’re ready and heading out to get their lists, Rio notices Agatha's loose gloves, quickly snatching one up just as they get in front of Lilia. Agatha quickly tries to snatch it back but Rio pulls it out of her reach and tucks it into her armpit.</p><p>“Rio.” Agatha says sternly, subtly smacking her in the leg.</p><p>Rio glances at her then turns her attention forward like nothing happened. Agatha decides against fighting this battle, Rio will eventually have to give it back to her, and having Lilia up her ass this early in the day is not very enticing.</p><p>“Agatha! Rio!” Lilia finally calls, waving them over to come talk to her. “So, we just got two twin brothers that are signed up for private lessons every Saturday and some selected weekdays.” Lilia starts to inform them. “One of them skis and the other snowboards.” She points to each of the women. “I’m assigning them to you two.” Agatha and Rio begin to smile when Lilia cuts them off with a stern, “But, if you’re bickering and tom foolery gets in the way, I will reassign them.” She quickly threatens the women who simply nod to say they understand. Rio quickly hands Agatha back her glove, gaining a disapproving scowl from Lilia.</p><p>“Great. Agatha, you will have Billy, and Rio, you will have Tommy. They are both sixteen and started learning last season but their parents want them to get really good so…. do that.” She pats them both on their upper arms, sending them on their way.</p><p>“I bet my twin’s cooler.” Rio immediately says as they grab their gear and begin to make their way over to the hill.</p><p>Agatha shakes her head. “I don’t really care how “cool” a teenager is.”</p><p>“Cooler than you, that's for sure. Snowboarding gets you an automatic fifty percent bump.” Rio grins.</p><p>Agatha scoffs and rolls her eyes, turning the upper half of her body so the skis on her shoulder smack Rio in the back of the helmet.</p><p>“Fuck.” She curses, stumbling forward a little bit. Once she recovers, she turns around, shaking her head. “Careful Agatha, wouldn’t want you getting us in trouble.” She teases.</p><p>“<em>You</em> are the one that’s going to get us in trouble.”</p><p>“Not if you’re always the one that reacts.” She pauses. “But, you know how I love to see you react.” She grins and picks up speed so a flustered Agatha is forced to walk behind her.</p><p>They make it to the bottom of the hill where they have to wait for the twins to get there. While they wait, Rio hovers obnoxiously close, kicking snow up onto Agatha's feet and batting the back of her helmet when she’s not looking.</p><p>Agatha senses the fourth time she winds up to hit her, quickly reaching up and grabbing onto her wrist.</p><p>“Stop it.” She says sternly, tossing her hand back down.</p><p>“Yes ma’am.” Rio forcefully moans, making Agatha roll her eyes. After a few more minutes, the family eventually finds them, the mother, going to greet them immediately.</p><p>“Hi! You must be their private instructors!” The boy's mom chimes, reaching out to shake each of their hands.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“Well, I’m Wanda, this is my husband, Vision, and these are our boys, Billy and Tommy.” She happily introduces the family.<br/>
“Billy skis and Tommy Snowboards.” The boys both wave politely.</p><p>“Great!” Rio smiles. “Tommy, you’re with me, the cool one.” Rio waves for him to come stand with her.</p><p>Agatha then points to Billy. “You’re mine.”</p><p>“So when do we come pick them up?”</p><p>“We’ll be done at one fifteen.” Rio informs them.</p><p>“Okay! Well boys, you two have a fantastic day.” Wanda walks forward, placing a kiss to both of their cheeks which the teens clearly do not appreciate as Tommy immediately wipes it off and Billy bites back an annoyed groan. Wanda and Vision both turn, leaving their boys to their instructors.</p><p>Agatha also turns, saluting as she says, “Well, we’ll see you two at lunch.” She begins to walk away when Billy stops her.</p><p>“We’re riding up together right?” The boy asks, looking down at Agatha hopefully. Agatha groans as she knows, she has to agree if she doesn’t want these kids' parents up her ass at the end of the day.</p><p>“Yup.” She pops the P. “We’re riding up together.” She makes a poor attempt at enthusiasm. And with that, she starts walking towards the lift, now with twins and Rio in towe. On the gondola, Rio and Agatha both sit next to their clients which makes it so they’re facing each other.</p><p>Agatha has noticed over time that Rio has this weird thing for eye contact. No matter what she does, she can never seem to make her break it unless she wants to. So right now, with her eyes staring daggers into her, she opts to pull down her goggles, at least making it so she can’t tell where she’s looking.</p><p>Rio only acknowledges it by huffing out a laugh then turning her attention to the boys. “So you two have been up before?”</p><p>They both nod their heads. “Yeah, we tried it for the first time last year.” Tommy tells her.</p><p>“Where at?”</p><p>“West view.” Billy answers.</p><p>“That place!?” Rio forces out a mocking laugh. “Oh boys, you’re about to be on a real mountain.” She pats Tommy’s knee.</p><p>Agatha chimes in. “How many days did you come up last season?”</p><p>Billy looks to his brother. “Uhhh, maybe twice?”</p><p>Rio and Agatha both share a look, reading <em>“What the fuck?” </em> They assumed they would have at least been up a minimum of four times.</p><p>“We were told you had a year of experience.” Rio informs them.</p><p>“Ugh, Mom.” The boys both groan.</p><p>“She tends to over exaggerate when it comes to us.” Billy informs them.</p><p>“Maybe for you.” His brother kicks at him. “I’m basically a pro already.” He proudly lifts his head, gaining an annoyed scowl from his brother.</p><p>“A pro you say?” Rio questions. “How are your S turns?”</p><p>Tommy sits up confidently. “I don’t need to turn, I'm all speed!”</p><p>Agatha forces herself to keep from laughing at Rio’s misfortune. They both know, a stubborn kid that already thinks they’re good is a whole different task.</p><p>“Billy?”</p><p>“Yeah, um, I’m okay.”</p><p>“He fell on the second day and now he’s scared.” Tommy says in a baby voice, leaning forward to tease his brother.</p><p>“Hey.” Rio stops him, looking straight at Billy. “If you're not falling, you’re not trying. You just gotta be able to get back up and you're halfway there.” She encourages him.</p><p>Agatha watches the interaction, accidently letting a smile settle on her face when she processes Rio’s stern but kind words.</p><p>“Alright, here’s the top.” Rio points out so they’re ready to unload. Rio walks out first, leading them all over to the learner's lift where she plops her snowboard upside down so it doesn’t slide away.</p><p>“Alright mr. confident, show me how to strap in?” She gestures for Tommy to sit down in the snow. He does just that, placing his foot into one binding, cranking the straps until they won’t go anymore.</p><p>“Ehh!” Rio mimics the sound of a buzzer, holding up a hard thumbs down, dropping to her knees.</p><p>“These need to be over your toes.” She quickly undoes both toe straps, pulling them up into the correct spot, securing them for him.</p><p>Meanwhile, Agatha is helping Billy.</p><p>“How do your boots feel?”</p><p>“Starting to hurt a little.” He answers.</p><p>“Let me see.” Agatha waves for him to present his foot to her.</p><p>”Yeah, these are waaaay too tight. What dumbass told you to do this?”</p><p>“My mom.” Billy hisses.</p><p>“Oh.” Agatha awkwardly pauses. “Well, you can show her what would make these a lot more comfortable. You should just be able to flick off your bottom bindings.” She tells him, flicking open the one she just fixed. “Your turn.” She steps back, allowing for him to fix the other three himself.</p><p>“Better?”</p><p>“Way.” He smiles, moving to clip into his bindings. He then scoots his way over to his brother while Rio skates over to Agatha. “The kid's Mom told him to tighten his bindings as tight as they would go.” Agatha throws her hands up, already annoyed.</p><p>“Well their Dad must have shit control because Tom had his toe strap basically under his foot.” Rio jabs a thumb over her shoulder. “So this should be fun for us.”</p><p>“Y’know we’re not staying together the whole day right?”</p><p>“Aww c’mon, it could be so much fun watching them nearly kill themselves all day.” Rio pouts, gaining a small chuckle from Agatha.</p><p>“No. Tommy clearly has it out for his brother and Billy does not need his incessant teasing while he’s learning.” Agatha points to where Tommy is already chucking snowballs at Billy who is waving his poles around in a poor attempt to block them.</p><p>“We can stay together for their test run. That's it.” Agatha says pointedly.</p><p>“I’ll take it.” Rio smiles, skating back over to the kids, plopping down to secure her free foot while Agatha also makes her way over.</p><p>“We’re going to go ahead and watch and see how well you two do.” Agatha tells them, pointing to the end of the run.<br/>
“Do not keep going. Stop when you get to us.” She tells them and the boys both nod.</p><p>The women head off down the hill, quickly making it to the designated spot halfway down, turning around to watch the boys. Billy heads off first, making careful and calculated turns.</p><p>Agatha intently watches him, noting how he has a hard time keeping his heels together and awkwardly has his butt stuck out as if that will make a fall less painful. Tommy, on the other hand, is sending it straight down the mountain, making no attempts to turn.</p><p>“You have a speed demon on your hands.” Agatha says, seconds before Tommy passes them as his attempt to stop didn’t work.</p><p>“My kinda dude!” Rio cheers, taking off after the boy who catches an edge and hits the ground with a thud. Agatha laughs at the kid, turning to watch Billy complete his run.</p><p>He hits pizza and barley comes to stop just above her. “Not bad. Your brother already fell, so you’re already doing better than him.” They both look down the hill where Rio is giving the boy a double high five before he flops back into the snow.</p><p>“I think we just need to build up your confidence first. You squat.” She immediately calls out. “You need to stand up, with your body leaning towards the mountain.” Agatha demonstrates. Billy mimics the motion, panicking when he slides back a little.</p><p>“You’re okay.” Agatha assures him. “I am telling you now, I am not here to be kind to you. You are gonna get good and that’s only gonna happen if you listen.” She says sternly.</p><p>Billy quickly nods his head.</p><p>“One rule though, no pizza.”</p><p>“What!?” Billy yelps.</p><p>“Yup, it’ll help you in the long run. Trust me. You’re gonna get so comfortable relying on pizza that you won’t learn much. I only use that for little kids.” Agatha bluntly tells him. “You know how to do it if you really need it but until then, it’s banned.” She crosses her poles to make a X.</p><p>Billy groans. “Fine.”</p><p>“Great! Now, I want you to watch me and try to mimic what I do. Then I'll critique you from there.” Agatha tells him, heading down the rest of the way, sure to exaggerate her movements for the boy. When she looks up, he’s following her trail, but his stance is still awkward and he’s still holding that pizza formation.</p><p>Agatha lets out a long sigh when he somehow manages to fall.<br/>
“Get up!” She yells to him, fighting a laugh as he struggles to stand back up.</p><p>As the lesson goes on, Agatha carefully watches Billy’s every move, critiquing and giving him tips on every single thing he does.</p><p>Around their third run, Agatha is getting more annoyed. “Your turns are good but you still need to build up that confidence. You’re squatting like you're afraid to fall!”</p><p>“I AM afraid to fall!”</p><p>“Well too bad. You are gonna fall no matter what. You should at least look like you know what you’re doing.”</p><p>Suddenly, two snowboarders come to a stop just below them, both of them landing on their knees. Tommy’s landing is significantly less graceful than Rios as his legs stay out straight behind him for a second and he has to catch himself to keep from face planting into the snow. Still, at least he came to a somewhat proper stop.</p><p>“Aww is little Billy scared to do his french fries.” Tommy mocks his brother.</p><p>“Shut up Tommy.” Billy snaps.</p><p>“Going well Agatha?” Rio asks.</p><p>She also snaps back, “Very. Thank you.”</p><p>“Well, once you figure out how to go down.” Tommy says in a baby voice. “Then we can race.” and with that, the two of them take off. Agatha watches them, noting that Tommy is still sticking to his method of straight lining it.</p><p>“Don’t listen to them.” Agatha waves them off. “I promise you if we got either of them in a pair of ski boots, they’d be crying after three steps.” She says, making the boy laugh. “Plus, look at your brother. He’s fast but he has no control.”</p><p>Billy looks down, watching as his brother rips down the mountain, narrowly avoiding Rio who tried to get him to come to a stop.</p><p>“You’ll be better than him. I know it.” Agatha assures him. “Now, let's get back to it!” She claps.</p><p>Two hours later, Billy is flopped back lazily on the chairlift while Agatha continues to coach him.</p><p>“You’re doing pretty good.” She pats his knee. “We’ll stop for lunch at the top, then I think you can get down Witches Road.” She names the main run, which is the easiest way for someone to get to the base.</p><p>“All the way to the bottom!?” Billy sits up.</p><p>“Yup, and the longer you go, the more confident you’ll get.” She assures him.</p><p>When they arrive at the top, they skate over to the lodge, resting their skis and poles on the racks outside.</p><p>“Well look how perfect that timing was.” Rio says when they endup walking inside at the same time.</p><p>“Lucky us.” Agatha says sarcastically.</p><p>Once they find a table, Rio and Agatha both go to get their food, leaving the boys to hold down the spot for them.</p><p>“Y’know I love lunch.” Rio hums, toying with the strap on her sleeve, locking eyes with the other woman.</p><p>“Because you get to fill that bottomless pit you call your stomach?”</p><p>“No.” Rio steps forward. “It means you have to take off your goggles and I get to see those pretty eyes.” She reaches up to touch her face which Agatha jerks herself away from.</p><p>Rio responds with a deep chuckle. “C’mon, you love it.”</p><p>“I don’t.” Agatha slaps her hand away once again. “How’s Toby doing?”</p><p>“Tommy.” Rio corrects the woman who just shrugs. “Pretty good. He’s fast and not afraid to fall.”</p><p>“Oh, who could’ve guessed that?”</p><p>“Hey, speed is very important for snowboarding.” Rio points.</p><p>“Yeah, it is, but I bet he’s refusing to learn his turns. Isn’t he?” Agatha places her hands on her hips, leaning forward.</p><p>“I’ll get him there.” Rio pushes the air in her direction.</p><p>“Well, Billy is doing great, thanks for asking. We’re gonna hit Witches Road after lunch.”</p><p>“Us too.”</p><p>“Oh yeah? Are you trying to see how many people he can take out in one go?”</p><p>Rio scoffs. “He hasn’t taken anyone out.”</p><p>“I saw him nearly clip you.” She sneers. “Plus, ” She gestures her hands all over Rio to highlight the layer of snow still coating her jacket. “Just visual cues.”</p><p>“If you’re not fff-“ She’s cut off by Agatha.</p><p>“Say that obnoxious saying one more time and I kick you in the shin.” She threatens.</p><p>Rio chooses not to test her, or the density of ski boots and instead raises her hand, making a zipped lip gesture over her mouth. They continue through the line peacefully. While most of the time, they are arguing, or hitting each other, or all around trying to make life a little more difficult for one another, they do have these rare moments where they’re not doing anything. They simply exist next to each other. Rio bumps her shoulder once, receiving a nudge back and a shared look that holds a lot more than either of them are letting on.</p><p>“I’m not sure if I can handle this much of your presence.” Agatha hisses on the way back to the table.</p><p>“I’m not sure I can either.” Rio agrees, her tone completely different than usual, it’s light but she’s not mocking her. It’s simply a statement.</p><p>One week later, they are once again sat at the top of the mountain with their private clients ready for their second lesson.</p><p>“Alright, lesson two! How we feeling!?” Rio asks her twin once they’re strapped into their boards.</p><p>“Good!” He beams. “I’m hyped to be up here again!”</p><p>“How bout you Billy?” Rio turns to the other boy. “How you feeling?”</p><p>“Good.” He says, significantly less enthused than his brother.</p><p>“Mind your own teen.” Agatha says to the woman, waving for her to stop talking to Billy. Rio throws her hands up in defense, turning back to Tommy. Agatha also faces Billy again. “Okay kid, It’s a powder day, which means you have to ride completely different.”</p><p>“Okay Tom, it’s a powder day which means, it’ll hurt even less to fall.” Rio flashes a wicked grin at Agatha who unsurprisingly rolls her eyes back at her.</p><p>“Not falling, not trying!” Tommy cheers.</p><p>Agatha without another word, waves for Billy to follow after her, as Rio is already as distracting as ever. The resort got three inches of freshly fallen snow the night before. The sky is cloudy but the snow has stopped, leaving only a light breeze to be felt. At the top, they look over the freshly drawn trails in the snow.</p><p>“I want you to ski like normal.” Agatha simply instructs, pointing for Billy to go ahead while she watches. As he makes his way down, he quickly proves that he has never skied in powder as he loses control and disappears into a puff of snow.</p><p>Agatha laughs on her way down to him while he stands himself back up. When she gets to him, to her schock, he’s laughing with her.</p><p>“So as you see, It is much easier to catch an edge in powder. As you just so expertly demonstrated.” She points as he continues to dust himself off. “So in order to not do that, you need to change how you carry your weight so you can float above it. You need to lean back.” She demonstrates that, leaning back as she pushes off, gliding over the snow. “It feels weird but do it.” She watches him shift his weight and push off, a large smile hitting his face as he realises how much better it feels.</p><p>Billy quickly falls into a rhythm, carefully tracing the intended trail his coach leaves behind and soon enough they’re at the bottom. Agatha points him over to a two seater lift. On his way over, Billy spots his brother and makes his way towards his spot in line which forces Agatha to also join them.</p><p>“Can we ride together?” Tommy hopefully asks his coach.<br/>
“Yeah, for sure. I need a break from you.” Rio jokes, skating out of the way so Billy can slide into the spot, just in time for them to move forward into the loading zone.</p><p>“May I?” Rio rhetorically asks as she steps into Billy’s spot.</p><p>“Like I have a choice.”</p><p>They both slide forward, the tips of their gear going just over the line. The chair scoops them up, each of them letting out a huff as they’re forced to sit.</p><p>“Jesus I forgot how fast this pick up is.” Rio breathes out as she adjusts herself on the swinging chair.</p><p>Agatha paws at her face mask, yanking it down, letting out a large huff as she’s able to breathe normally.</p><p>“Halfway there.” She hears Rio say and turns to give her a confused look when she realizes what she means.</p><p>“I am not taking my goggles off.” She states.</p><p>“Oh c’mon you can’t keep those diamonds all to yourself.” She reaches out to pull the goggles off for her which Agatha stops by grabbing her hand, throwing it back down to her side. They both know that it’s unlikely that Rio would’ve been able to get the goggles off with just one gloved hand. But, they both know they enjoy the teasing to some extent. They’re both guilty of  chasing it.</p><p>“I’ve been meaning to ask.” Rio sits back. “How’d you start skiing?”</p><p>“Why do we have to talk?”</p><p>“Because anything goes on a lift. I’ve met some of my closest friends up here.” She jokes. Of course she’s made “friends” on the lift, it’s one of the few places total strangers can sit in comfortable silence or become best friends in just a few minutes.</p><p>“Fine.” Agatha sighs. “I’ve been skiing since I was a kid.” She vaguely answers.</p><p>“So you grew up close?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Different state?”</p><p>Agatha still doesn’t reply.</p><p>“I bet you're from Washington or something. Somewhere cold to match your heart.” She tries to insult her to force a confession but it only results in a small chuckle.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Rio waits before speaking again. Agatha has left much up to the imagination when it comes to her personal life. Although their interactions are limited to pretty much just bickering and teasing, part of her wants to know more about the woman. Her confident persona is one she wants to learn about, to pick at. She wants to hear her stories and learn her ins and outs. Though she was hoping the peacefulness of the lift would get her at least a little vulnerable, it didn’t.</p><p>“What about where you live now?”</p><p>Agatha holds a knowing look on her face, or mouth, as far as Rio can see. “You are just desperate to know something about me. Aren’t you?” She tilts her head, waiting for a response.</p><p>“Is it so crazy that I find you fascinating?” She slightly leans over into Agatha's space, at least as much as the chairlift will allow.</p><p>“Nothing fascinating about me.” She shrugs.</p><p>“I doubt that.” Rio looks her up and down, making her gaze clear by following the motion with her head.</p><p>“What about you? You had to get all of this confidence from somewhere.”</p><p>“Nuh uh uh.” Rio tsks. “No trade, no info.” She taps her helmet like she’s tapping her skull.</p><p>“Nice try.” Agatha calls her out for trying to use her own personal life as a means to get her to talk. “It’s cute how badly you wanna know about me though.”</p><p>Rio huffs at that, turning back so she’s fully facing forward.</p><p>“I will say though, you weren't wrong about the somewhere cold guess.”</p><p>Rio almost begins begging for more information but judging by Agatha's relaxed and unbothered state, she knows that’s exactly what she wants her to do. So she lets it go. At least out loud, but in her mind, she’s running through every possible place that could mean.</p><p>At the end of the day, in the locker room, Alice is once again proposing another one of her post-work hangouts.</p><p>“Do you guys wanna go get a drink?”</p><p>While Agatha will sometimes join them on an after work ski run, she has never agreed to drinks. But then she cuts back to her conversation with Rio on the lift. The way she spoke, she was different, finally stepping back from the obnoxious personality she loves to put on so much. Her questions were simple but they felt genuine in a way. She knows that Rio won’t necessarily follow them to the bar but then again, maybe she has more control over her than she thinks. She quickly shakes that idea from her head, turning her mind towards a definitive “no” then before she knows it, she's sitting at a table with Jen and Alice, waiting for Rio to bring over their drinks.</p><p>“So how are your private lessons going?” Alice asks when Rio returns with a tray of beers.</p><p>“Good. Billy actually fucking listens to me, his confidence is growing and after today, he’s finally excited for our next lesson.” Agatha watches as Rio passes each of them a glass.</p><p>“Mines, great!” She joyfully tells them. “Little speed demon, he’s almost faster than me.”</p><p>“Yeah, if he didn’t wipe out every time he has to turn.” Agatha laughs.</p><p>“We’re working on it.” Rio retorts. “He just thinks he’s hot shit because he can snowboard. We’ll get there.” She sits back, confident in her claim.</p><p>“Well Billy is already way better than last week.” She laughs as she remembers their questionable first day. “He doesn't even try to use pizza anymore unless we’re in line.” Agatha brags, taking a swig of her beer.</p><p>“Can he make it top to bottom in fifteen minutes?” Rio is now leaning halfway over the table just to get in Agatha's space.</p><p>“By then end of the month, I bet I can have him down in eight.” Agatha glares back.</p><p>The two of them are near standing, leaning across the table, silently challenging one another. Agatha is searching Rios eyes, watching as she suddenly has a realisation and plops back into her seat.</p><p>“End of the month then.” Agatha waits for her to explain her words. “End of the month, let's see who’s kid is better.” She crosses her arms, waiting for a response.</p><p>“So we’re gonna have them race?”</p><p>Rio nods, watching as Agatha thinks.</p><p>“Okay.” She agrees, only thinking it over for a moment. “But, if Billy wins, you have to try skiing for a day.” Agatha proposes, mimicking Rio's pose, also sitting back confidently, crossing her arms. The two women glare at one another, Rio juts out her chin, challenging the other woman. Agatha stares back at her, showing no signs of backing down. That is until Rio makes a counter offer. “And if Tommy is better than Billy, you have to try snowboarding.”</p><p>Agatha pauses, considering her options. She’s seen Tommy board. While he has potential to be really good, he takes a very long time before actually listening to Rio. Plus, the idea of Rio waddling around in ski boots, and going down the mountain in Pizza, is too good of an opportunity to pass up. So she sticks her hand out to the woman. “Deal.” They shake on it, setting it in motion.</p><p>“Oh great.” Jen groans. “Just what we need, you two to have a bet.”</p><p>“Don’t you wanna see Rio on some ski’s?” Agatha asks, leaning over. “How stupid is she going to look when she’s doing Pizza the whole way down?” She starts to laugh along with Jen as they both picture what that might look like.</p><p>“I will not!” Rio jumps to her own defence. “I’m gonna send it.”</p><p>“Oh so you're admitting that you’re gonna have to learn to ski?” Agatha smiles knowingly.</p><p>“Absolutely not. But I am excited to see how much hotter you get on a snowboard.” Rio snaps back to her usually flirty demeanour, gaining the expected scowl from Agatha.</p><p>“I don’t think you guys should be using your students as hamsters for your weird rivalry.” Alice comments.</p><p>“They’re polar opposite twin brothers, I'm sure they’ll be on board.” Agatha pushes the air in her direction.</p><p>“Oh so you’re actually gonna tell them?”</p><p>“I have a feeling Billy will get really motivated once he finds out it’s now a competition.” Agatha nods as if she’s scheming something.</p><p>“Tom already thinks that.” Rio retorts.</p><p>“Exactly.” Agatha points. “That’s why I'm gonna win. Your kid already thinks he’s great. My kid is trying to become great.”</p><p>Rio opens her mouth to say something but her eyes show that she’s thinking as she snaps her mouth shut and sits back. One thing Agatha has noticed is that if Rio knows she’s wrong, she won’t admit it. But, it will shut her up.</p><p>“Shouldn’t you guys have some guidelines?” Alice suggests.</p><p>“Good idea!” Rio returns to her usual state. “How’bout, dopeness, litness, and flyness.” She lists off, tapping a finger with each one.</p><p>All three of them ignore her and move on to think of the guidelines.</p><p>“Speed, Agility, and…” Jen taps her chin as she tries to think of one more.</p><p>“Turns.” Alice suggested.</p><p>“That's the same as agility.” Jen waves it off.</p><p>“Not exactly.” Rio jumps in. “Turning is important no matter how many people are around, but navigating a big crowd, now that's a totally different kind of control.”</p><p>“Okay. Speed, Agility, and Turns.” Agatha agrees to the three qualifications. “They have a lesson on Wednesday, Saturday, the next Friday and then the Saturday after that, it’s test day.” She confirms.</p><p>“Then on Monday, you’ll be on a snowboard.” Rio leans in.</p><p>“Absolutely not.” Agatha rests her chin in her hand, curling her fingers around her jaw. “But I am excited to watch you squirm...” She plays with her lip, watching several conflicting emotions flood Rio’s face. “In your ski boots.” She lets out an obnoxious laugh, leaning back in her chair. Rio stares back at her before frantically pulling on an unbothered smile.</p>

<p>Wednesday, Lesson 3</p><p>“Okay you two!” Rio claps after the doors to the Gondola close. “We have a proposal for you.”</p><p>The boys, immediately interested, both lean in to give them their undivided attention.</p><p>“We have decided to make a little bet.” Agatha starts. “We wanna know which one of you will be better at the end of the month.” Agatha points between the two of them. “Whoever’s kid is better, the other has to try their sport for a day.”</p><p>“And what do we win?” Tommy asks, lifting his eyebrows.</p><p>“You get to rub it in your bro’s face for as long as you want.” Rio offers, staring directly at Tommy, not even taking Billy winning as a possibility.</p><p>“So what do we have to do?” Billy asks.</p><p>“Next saturday, we’re gonna test you on Speed, Agility, and Turns.” Rio lists off.</p><p>“So that means?”</p><p>Agatha and Rio look at eachother, they didn’t discuss the precise details.</p><p>Agatha quickly thinks up their requirements and lists them off. “You’ll have to complete a black with Moguls, a highly trafficked blue, and Witches road, top to bottom.”</p><p>The brothers look at eachother, silently deciding whether or not they’ll agree to it. Even if they don’t agree, Agatha and Rio will be testing them anyway. But they allow them to think they have a choice.</p><p>“Okay.” Tommy casually shrugs, pulling a slow and mischievous smile onto his face seconds later. “We’re totally gonna win!” Him and Rio share a high-five.</p><p>Meanwhile, Agatha locks eyes with Billy, shaking her head and pursing her lips to silently tell him “No way.” Billy softly smiles, taking that as high praise from his otherwise stern instructor.</p><p>Once again at the top of the mountain, Agatha opts to take Billy down the other side for the day.</p><p>“Can’t stand to see the competition?” Rio asks when she notices their new route.</p><p>“No, but my kid knows how to turn so we’re trying out moguls today.” She condescendly informs her.</p><p>“What!?” Billy yelps. Agatha just bats her hand at him, still fully facing Rio as she walks backwards. She can see it on Rio’s still uncovered face, that that comment indeed pissed her off. She knows she has to get Tommy to turn more than once every two hundred feet if she wants any chance at winning.</p><p>Agatha's smirk pulls Rio away from the many comebacks rushing through her mind and she kindly yells, “I’ll miss you!” Followed by her blowing the woman a kiss that Agatha pretends to slap out of the air just before it gets to her. When she fully turns back around, Billy is staring at her.</p><p>“So are you two like…” The boy pauses awkwardly, weighing his next words. “together?”</p><p>Agatha jerks her head back in shock, quickly spitting out, “No. That woman is a pain in my ass and gets off on making my day difficult.” She snaps.</p><p>Billy bugs his eyes, throwing his hands up in surrender.</p><p>“Sorry, it just seems kinda like, y’know, playfully banter?”</p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes. “Nothing playful about it. She pisses me off, I exact my revenge, and she refuses to give it up.” She rifles through their daily routine.</p><p>“Mhm.” Billy hums, squinting his eyes as if he doesn't believe her. “So this bet is because you hate each other?”</p><p>“Keep judging me and I'm taking you down a double black.” Agatha threatens the boy, officially making him back down.</p><p>He finally moves on from his suspicions, panic setting in as he remembers what Agatha said they’re doing today. “So I have to do moguls today?” He asks, clear panic in his voice.</p><p>“You’ll be fine.” Agatha waves him off. “They’re to the side of a blue, if you really need to, you can get out.” That slightly eases his nerves. “Plus, key word, “trying” We’ll get mostly blues in. But on Saturday.” She clicks her tongue. “We’re going to the bowl.”</p><p>“Really?” Billy groans, dramatically flapping his arms around.</p><p>“Yes. You agreed to this and I’ll be damned if I have to lose to Rio.” She forcefully shudders. “Now watch me. You need to think of it as every other bump.” Agatha begins to explain. “Do not try and squeeze through every opening, you pass two, turn on one, pass two turn on one. Got it?”</p><p>Billy frantically nods his head.</p><p>“and keep your feet together, there isn’t room for you to stand like normal. And look at least three ahead of you, do not look down.” She rifles off her tips before suddenly taking off with no warning.</p><p>Billy watches her as she expertly makes her way down the side of the run. Her knees bend perfectly timed with each impact and her poles allow her to keep herself centered. When Billy tries to use his poles, he’s barely able to keep them in his hands. It’s like magic watching her do her thing.</p><p>She skids to a stop at the bottom, raising her poles in the air to tell the teen it’s his turn. Billy takes a deep breath, willing himself to begin. He takes his time going down. He tries his best to keep his eyes forward but they instinctively fall to the moguls closest to him.</p><p>Agatha represses her desire to immediately yell at him, instead allowing him to make his mistakes on his first attempt. After a slow descent, he’s at the bottom, anxiously waiting for his coach's review.</p><p>“Not bad.” She admits. “We’ll finish this run then you’re doing it again.” She takes off, and Billy at this point knows that he better follow her or he’s on his own.</p><p>The second attempt goes better, the third even more so. His confidence grows but he still can’t seem to keep his eyes ahead of him. Especially when he doesn’t anticipate the size of a bump and he instinctively jabs his pole into the ground in front of him which makes the handle jam into his stomach, immediately knocking the wind out of him.</p><p>“Woah!” Agatha yells, skidding to a stop next to him. “You okay?”</p><p>Billy is now on the ground, gasping for breath, clambering to get himself into an upright position.</p><p>“Okay, just catch your breath. We’re done with Moguls.” She assures him, showing a rare moment of patience and understanding.</p><p>“No, no I wanna keep going.” Billy bats at the air as if physically pushing her offer away.</p><p>Agatha, surprised by his resilience, slides back to allow him some space. “Alright then. Let's go again.”</p><p>Billy huffs a few more times as the air in his lungs evens again.</p><p>“Have you ever had the wind knocked out of you?” Agatha stifles a laugh. Billy shakes his head, finally pulling himself to sit up.</p><p>“Pretty fun isn’t it?” She laughs.</p><p>Billy continues to shake his head, letting a small chuckle out.</p><p>“Ready to get back at it?”</p><p>Billy huffs hard and wills himself to stand.</p><p>At the end of the day, Agatha is leading an exhausted Billy to the usual spot where they meet their parents.</p><p>When he sees his mother, he snaps into an enthusiastic mood, yelling, “Mom! I did moguls today!”</p><p>“Moguls!? That’s awesome!” Wanda cheers, throwing her arms up in celebration.</p><p>“Where’s your brother?”</p><p>“They should be close behind us.” Agatha says. “We passed them a little while ago.”</p><p>“How’s Tommy doing?” Their dad asks.</p><p>“Good, I think. He’s fast, that's for sure.” Billy answers. Him and Agatha laugh together, earning confused looks from Wanda and Vision.</p><p>Agatha jumps in to explain themselves. “Rio is just working on getting him to turn. He’s very confident.” She represses a chuckle.</p><p>Saturday Lesson 4</p><p>“Tom!” I really need you to work on those turns dude!” Rio yells when she comes to a stop after another one of his wipeouts which at this point, have to be intentional.</p><p>“I’m trying!” He shakes the snow out of his hood.</p><p>“No you’re not! You think that you can just straight line it and be completely fine. Number one, you’re gonna kill yourself or some poor three year old that you can’t maneuver around. And two…” She takes a deep breath. “I WANT TO WIN!”</p><p>Tommy blows out an unbothered puff of air. “I’m gonna win.”</p><p>“Not if you don’t learn your turns.” Rio snaps. “Now listen to me, little boy.” She straightens her back, holding up her hands to use as a demonstration. “When I yell heel, you go to your heel and when I yell toe, you go to your toes. If I see you straight line without me explicitly telling you to, we’re going to the bunny hill for the rest of the day.” She sternly tells him, jabbing her thumb over her shoulder for emphasis.</p><p>Tommy for once stays silent, telling his coach that he’ll (reluctantly) do what she says.</p><p>“Great. Now get up. I wanna see some falling leaf from you.” She waves for him to rise.</p><p>“For real!?” He groans.</p><p>“For real!?” Rio yells back, mocking his pubescent voice. “Go. You can stop when you get to the end of those trees.”</p><p>With a huff, Tommy begins to run the drill, riding on his heels the whole way to the checkpoint. Although he follows directions, he shifts his weight to his other foot as minimally as possible the whole way down.</p><p>“Good, you just need to make more turns.”</p><p>“Why?” He groans again.</p><p>“Because you’re gonna need this when you hit those moguls and need to take them slower than I know you want to. Plus on agility, you need to be able to move around anyone or anything at a moment's notice.” She snaps her fingers, although there's no sound due to her gloves.</p><p>“We’re finishing this run with falling leaf. Then I'm telling you heel and toe on the next one.” She pats his shoulder, and waits to observe him for the rest of the run. Once they’re at the top again, Rio is still actively deciding what to do with the stubborn kid.</p><p>“Are you ready for Heel/Toe or should we do falling leaf again?” She asks.</p><p>“What happened to if you’re not falling, you’re not trying?”</p><p>“Well now it's, if you’re falling on purpose, you’re not learning.” She waves for him to start going.</p><p>“Heel!” He follows the instruction. She waits a few seconds before yelling again. “Toe!” This continues on until the boy disappears around some trees and when Rio rounds them herself, she sees him on his knees, looking down at something.</p><p>“Rio!” Tommy yells. “Don’t come up too fast!”</p><p>Confused by his request, Rio slows down as she approaches him. When she gets to the boy, she finds him watching a medium sized bird walking around him, pecking at the snow.</p><p>“What kind of bird is this?” He asks.</p><p>Rio observes it, taking note of the spots along its wings and the orange feathers on its face, almost resembling eyebrows.</p><p>“A ptarmigan?” She questions her own answer before she remembers its name. “No, that's a grouse.” She pulls out her phone to take a picture. Tommy poses with the bird, leaning towards it and giving a thumbs up.</p><p>“Alright, you’re dope Mr.grouse.” He smiles. The bird then looks up at him as if it knows he’s talking to it. Tommy pushes off so he’s standing again but as he starts to go, the bird starts to walk towards him. Tommy carefully watches as he gains speed and the animal does as well. He starts to really pick up when suddenly the bird leaves the ground and is flying straight at him. He screams, straightlining to get as far away as fast as possible. He continues screaming as the bird does not let up and Rio follows after him, laughing harder than she ever has before. His straight lining method proves ineffective as it simply gives the bird an easy flying pattern to continue chasing him. Tommy is still screaming but after a few more seconds, the bird finally gives up and flies away.</p><p>“You’re good!” Rio yells after him, bursting back into laughter as they both skid to a stop</p><p>“Holy shit!” Tommy gasps for air, doubled over on the slope.</p><p>“I think he saw himself in your goggles.” She laughs out. Tommy joins in after he catches his breath, the two of them unable to speak for another minute.</p><p>“Now you know why you need to be able to turn.” Rio points out.</p><p>“Yeah yeah.” Tommy finally admits, then the two of them are laughing again.</p><p>In the locker room, Rio is recounting the story to her colleagues who are also dying laughing</p><p>“No fucking way!” Alice laughs in disbelief.</p><p>“Why would it chase him!?” Jen is still laughing.</p><p>“I think it saw itself in his goggles.” Rio tells them her theory.</p><p>Agatha is at her locker, internally laughing at the story though she stubbornly refuses to let anyone know that.</p><p>“You two are still down to help judge right?” She turns to ask Jen and Alice.</p><p>“Next Saturday?” Jen double checks.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Yeah, we can do it.” She confirms.</p><p>“What’s their route?” Alice asks. Rio and Agatha look at each other as they realise they should probably pick the runs they have to go down.</p><p>“Nothing yet. We’ll tell you.” Rio waves them off. They all finish packing up for the day. Agatha starts to leave the mostly empty locker room when Rio calls after her.</p><p>“Wait up Agatha.”</p><p>When Agatha turns around, she see’s Rio straddling the center bench, unfolding a map of the mountain.</p><p>“C’mere, We need to pick the route for the boys.” She pats the spot across from her, urging Agatha to sit. Agatha shakes out her head and agrees, sitting down above where the map is set.</p><p>“So I’m thinking, we take them back here to Trial.” She points to the black run over on the back of the mountain.</p><p>“Rio, no. You know how many rocks are back there. They need moguls.” Agatha points to a different run off the same peak. “Mephisto.”</p><p>“Ugh fine.” Rio rolls her eyes and continues on. “Well that will still take us here then we can take this lift up and take them down Ballad.” She points to the long blue run. “That one is usually super busy and it has this road which is harder to navigate.”</p><p>Agatha nods her head. “Then we take them back to the top to test their speed, top to bottom.” Agatha finishes off for them.</p><p>When she looks back up from the map, she finds Rio using her hands as support, leaning in so she’s hovering over the map between them, inches away from Agatha's face.</p><p>“Sound good?” Agatha asks, her blue eyes flickering between Rio’s steady brown ones. Rio painfully slowly begins nodding her head, causing Agatha to let out a scoff.</p><p>“What?” She regrettably asks, her tone hard and annoyed.</p><p>“Just…” Rio pauses, her eyes flickering down her face, landing on her lips. “You have gorgeous lips.”</p><p>Agatha is so taken back by the comment that she doesn't immediately respond. She simply twitches her head, her eyebrows furrowing with confusion.</p><p>“Welp, glad we have a route.” Rio stands up like nothing happened, crumpling up the map and tossing it into her locker. “See you tomorrow.” She waves over her shoulder, leaving behind the older woman to question her entire existence.</p><p>Friday, Lesson 5</p><p>Rio and Agatha spend the final practice day on opposite sides of the mountain so they can assure their student is at the top of his game.</p><p>Rio proudly cheers when Tommy finally completes a full run with the proper amount of turns and Agatha nods in approval when Billy comes to a seamless stop after successfully completing the black she sent him down.</p><p>At the bottom while waiting for their parents, they get to talking again.</p><p>“Okay tomorrow, it’s test day.” Agatha reminds the two as if they haven’t been talking about it all day. “I bet your folks have you up in some cushy lodge so make use of that hot tub.” She points between the two of them.</p><p>“You’re gonna get smoked.” Tommy teases his brother, batting him in the helmet.</p><p>“No fucking way.” Billy replies, returning the slap.</p><p>“Great, yeah, keep that energy.” RIo approves of the taunting.</p><p>After the boys return to their parents Agatha pulls off her gloves and begins heading back towards the ski school building.</p><p>“Actually.” Rio grabs the tips of her skis, pulling her backwards. “I think before tomorrow, you and I need to have a little race of our own. Y’know, test out the boys route.” She suggests, raising her eyebrows.</p><p>“Okay.” Agatha quickly agrees, stepping into line for the gondola.</p><p>They arrive at the back bowl, gearing up for their first selected run.</p><p>“Hurry up!” Agatha whines, tapping Rio’s helmet with her pole.</p><p>Rio pauses from fastening her bindings and whips around, reaching out and shoving her ski so she slips a little. “Be patient, asshole.”</p><p>“This “asshole” could’ve left you behind the second we got off the lift. You’re welcome, dick.” She hits her helmet again just as she finishes strapping in.</p><p>“Fine. Let's go then. After you, m’lady.” Rio gestures for Agatha to go ahead, which she does, with a huff.</p><p>They’re both good at moguls so they take the run like normal. They pause halfway down, to review their path.</p><p>“Shit, I don’t know if Billy can do this.” Agatha huffs, leaning on her poles for support.</p><p>“Too bad. You picked it.” Rio laughs.</p><p>“You sure Tommy can make it?” Agatha asks, an annoyingly condescending lilt to her voice.</p><p>“I took him down so many moguls today, yes, he’ll be fine.” Rio picks herself back up to go the rest of the way down.</p><p>Once they load onto the next lift, Agatha confirms their selection. “Alright, officially Mephisto?”</p><p>“Yup.” Rio shakes her board around to knock off the snow she collected from the run.</p><p>“Next is Ballad.” Agatha reminds her.</p><p>“Ughhhhhh!!!” Rio dramatically groans, throwing her head back. “It’s 2 o'clock. It is literally the worst possible time to take that.”</p><p>“Thats the whole fucking point.”</p><p>Rio sticks her tongue out to mock the woman as if she wasn’t the one to pick this run. Agatha shakes her head, turning her attention back to the mountain below them. She looks ahead where there is a portion of the ride where the chair is only about eight feet off the ground. This particular spot is not a run so there is almost always several feet of undisturbed powder.<br/>
She turns her head back to look at Rio, waiting until she feels her gaze and also turns her head.</p><p>“What is it that you said about my lips the other day?”</p><p>Rio is so shocked by the question that she can’t compose herself before speaking and instead stumbles for words. “Uh that-that they’re uh beautiful.” She spits out as quickly as her mind will let her. Agatha never acknowledges her advances.</p><p>“Oh yeah?” Agatha changes to a hushed, sultry tone. “You look at them a lot?” She places a hand on the seat between them, leaning in slightly.</p><p>Rio might as well be clawing her way over to the woman with the way she’s drifting towards her, slowly nodding her head.</p><p>Agatha juts out a lip as if to say “Aw you poor thing” Then before Rio knows it, she’s angling her head so they’re helmets won’t hit. Rio also begins to lean in. Agatha glaces to the side where she sees they’re about to pass over the spot she’s had her eyes on. Then just as they’re about to make contact, Agatha quickly places a hand on the other woman's back, shoving her forward. Rio screams as she drops a few feet, disappearing into a puff of powder. She emerges from the snow where she see’s Agatha manically cackling from the lift, gleefully swinging her legs, nearly falling off herself.</p><p>“Fuck you!” Rio screams, but she can’t help but smile as that was perfectly executed.</p><p>“I’ll be in the lodge!” Agatha yells back, returning to dying laughing while the chair carries her away. Rio huffs, picking up her legs and pulling off her board to walk herself over to the trail so she can get back on the lift.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, Rio is stomping her way into the lodge where Agatha is lounged back, sipping on a drink from the bar.</p><p>“You’re infuriating.” Rio huffs, slamming her hands onto the table.</p><p>“How so?” Agatha asks innocently.</p><p>“That was good.” She admits, shaking her head. “But you can’t just do that!” She yells, careful to not admit what just happened as they could both lose their jobs.</p><p>“You just slipped.” She shrugs. “C’mon let's go, I’ve been waiting.” Agatha fakes exasperation as she leans over to retighten her boots. Rio inhales audibly, making Agatha look back up at her as she stands.</p><p>“Aw, are you sad you didn’t get what you wanted?” She forces a pout, only driving Rio crazier. “C’mon…pet.” Agatha lazily waves a hand over her shoulder, beckoning Rio to follow her back outside which she does without question.<br/></p>

<p>Saturday, Lesson 6</p><p>“So are we getting some sort of compensation for helping you two judge?” Jen asks as they make their way over to pickup the twins.</p><p>“You don’t have to hear us argue whether or not one of us cheated?” Agatha offers.</p><p>Rio jumps in. “No guarantee on that. You could’ve paid them off.” She points out.</p><p>“I don’t need to pay them.” She confidently replies.</p><p>Rio simply shrugs, not fully letting the theory go.</p><p>“So what I'm getting is that you two are still gonna be annoying as hell no matter how this turns out?” Alice checks, though she knows she’s right.</p><p>“Yup!” Rio smiles, skipping ahead of them.</p><p>“And here they are!” Rio beams when they meet the boys. This time their parents are nowhere to be seen but they don’t question it, they probably just wanted to get started with their day.</p><p>Agatha loudly announces, “Test dayyyyyyy!” To which the boys both cheer.</p><p>“Okay you two.” Rio places a hand on one shoulder of each of the boys. “This is basically the X games.”</p><p>The twins share a confused look. “The X games?”</p><p>“Y’know.” She says, hoping they're joking. They both slowly shake their heads.</p><p>“Oh my god, you’re serious.” She sighs in disappointment. “It’s a big skiing competition in Aspen every year.” She quickly explains, watching as it barely registers in the kids minds.</p><p>“Whatever, let's get moving.” Agatha waves for them to get into line. They cut through into the ski school line where they’re able to immediately hop on the lift.</p><p>“This is Jen and Alice, they’re judging you.” Agatha informs the twins, introducing the two women. “This is Billy and Tommy.”</p><p>The four of them all wave at each other.</p><p>Rio suddenly whips a map out of her pocket and slams her hand into it to gain everyone’s attention.</p><p>“Alright people, this is the route. Focus up!” She points to the map. “At the top, we’ll take the second gondola to the back then we’ll ride to the broom lift and ride up to the bowl so you guys can take Mephesto for the moguls.” Everyone follows her finger as she points to the path. “Then we’ll ride back up and take Ballad for your agility test. Then we’ll make our way back over to the top and you guys will race to the bottom.” She looks back to the other four people, who all one by one nod in agreement. ”Then we’ll go to the lodge and I can start giving Agatha tips for when she has to snowboard.” She grins at the other woman.</p><p>“You’re gonna need to do more than just manifest.” Agatha says back, completely unbothered.</p><p>They eventually make it to the back bowl and station themselves at the very top of Mephisto.</p><p>“Welcome to your first trial.” Agatha gestures to the run below them before turning back to Billy. “So uh… I guess when you go, we’ll just follow behind you and you guys wait and go after us.” She shrugs as she comes up with the plan in that moment.</p><p>“Why do you get to go first?” Rio questions, jutting her neck out as she leans forward.</p><p>“Because who’s bright idea was this?”</p><p>”Mine!” Rio yelps.</p><p>Agatha fakes a wince, pretending to look up in thought. “Ehhhh, I'm pretty sure I was the one who said my kid was faster first.”</p><p>That of course makes Rios blood boil and she has to keep from pushing Agatha over.</p><p>“Alright, teen, let's do this.” Agatha moves on, patting the kids back as they all gear up to start going. Jen gets set next to him while he looks down at the steep mogul covered run ahead of him.</p><p>“C’mon teen you got this.” Agatha encourages him as he takes a moment to psych himself up.</p><p>After one more deep breath, he suddenly takes off with a push and begins making his way down. Rio, Tommy, Alice, and Agatha all watch him carefully take each mogul, only slipping up once as Jen follows closely behind. It’s not perfect but considering he was just thrown into his first moguls a week ago, he’s doing good.</p><p>Rio turns to Agatha. “You said you thought Billy wouldn’t be able to make these.”</p><p>Agatha smiles. “I've said a lot of things.” She pushes off, following after Jen and Billy.</p><p>“Yeah way to go Billy!” She screams as she watches the kid who is laser focused, taking each bit of his coaching and piling it into this one run.</p><p>They get to the bottom of the run, coming to stop so Tommy can have his turn.</p><p>“Dammit! We can’t see!” Agatha groans, trying to look around the trees.</p><p>“How’d I do?” Billy huffs.</p><p>“Great kid, no way your brother can beat that.” Agatha slaps him in the back again, watching as he beams with pride. They eventually see Tommy making his way down the moguls, much less confident than Billy was. Agatha snickers, Rio must’ve wasted so much time just trying to get the boy to turn like normal.</p><p>They finally hit the bottom in nearly double the time it took Billy.</p><p>“What was that?” Billy mocks his brother once he’s in ear shot.</p><p>“Shut up.” Tommy bites, taking off before he can get insulted any further.</p><p>“Yeah Rio, what was that?” Agatha asks, tilting her head.</p><p>“We still have two more runs.” Rio snaps, hopping back up to take off after Tommy. Agatha shakes her head, chuckling to herself.</p><p>Once they’re in line, Rio makes room for Agatha to join their chair which she refuses.</p><p>“Nope, skiers ride together and the three of you can trip over each other alone.” Agatha slides into line with Jen and Billy. Rio just scoffs out a laugh and allows her to move along. Although, she does take the opportunity to slide her board over the back of her skiis the whole time they’re in line. Agatha whacks her in the shin, finally getting her to stop just before they load.</p><p>On the chair lift, Rio immediately begins coaching Tommy again.</p><p>“Alright Tom, I’m gonna really need you to be on your A game this next one.” Rio says sternly. “You need to anticipate what the people below you are doing, not just where you want to go.”</p><p>Tommy nods his head. “Right right.” He repeats, although his tone does not tell the woman that he’s listening.</p><p>“Tom!” She snaps. “I’m serious. Billy killed it on the moguls. You’re not winning that one, you really need to step it up for the last two.”</p><p>Alice is just nodding from behind Rio to also help encourage the boy.</p><p>“I know.” Tommy states, clearly at least a little more serious this time.</p><p>Meanwhile, on the skier's chair, Agatha is relaxed.</p><p>“All you gotta do is kill it again on either of these two runs and I win.” She confidently pats Billy’s leg.</p><p>“We win.” He corrects her which she just brushes off with a lazy wave back at him.</p><p>“You are doing great Billy.” Jen smiles at the boy, noticing he clearly needs a little more explicit certainty since Agatha’s method is hoping her confidence will transfer over.</p><p>When they regroup at the top of the next run, Rio takes a turn to explain this test.</p><p>“Okay, you guys will go down this one together. We’ll all be watching you again to see how well you maneuver around people. Extra points for each person you barely miss.” She jokingly offers, which Alice and Jen both roll their eyes at.</p><p>“Are you idiots gonna strap in or what?” Agatha impatiently taps her pole on the edge of Rios board. They each plop themselves down and strap in as quickly as they can.</p><p>“Alright, after you frick and frack.” Agatha gestures for the boys to go ahead.</p><p>The group all takes off. Agatha and Jen stay close to Billy while Rio and Alice stay by Tommy as they all make their way down.</p><p>The top of the run is only partially crowded as they’re all easily able to move around the people, currently keeping the boys' skill level even. Then they round the corner where there are significantly more people. Tommy chooses to take a route that, at the time he sees it, is open but as he nears it, it fills in with people. Billy opts for the side of the run, barely dodging a skier who is cutting straight across. Tommy manages to get out of the crowd unscathed and still on his feet.</p><p>They round the next corner onto a somewhat steep road, allowing for a lot less space to maneuver. Luckily there are only a few people going down so it’s easier than expected. Both boys are doing well when Tommy decides to go rogue and try to avoid a skier by hitting a jump off the side of the hill. He gets about a foot of air but fails to land it and hits the ground with a thud.</p><p>“Why would you do that!?” Rio yells.</p><p>“Ha!” Tommy just laughs and dusts himself off. “Can we try the terrain park next week?”</p><p>Rio glares at him, letting her silence speak volumes as he gets himself going again.</p><p>Meanwhile with Billy on the next run, Jen and Agatha watch as he accidently clips a girl that he assumed would turn, sending her off balance, luckily she keeps herself upright. Agatha want’s to yell at him but resists and decides if he messes up again, then she’ll let him have it.  Luckily, he makes it to the bottom without taking anyone else out.</p><p>On the lift, they’re all able to sit together as it’s an eight seater.</p><p>“That one was a lot closer than the moguls.” Alice says, based on what she saw from both boys together.</p><p>“Yeah I'm not sure who won that.” Jen agrees.</p><p>“My kid didn’t eat shit!” Agatha yells.</p><p>“The goal was to avoid people, not to land a jump.” Rio snaps back, the two women are now staring daggers at each other. They’ve always been competitive but today has made them extra aggressive with it.</p><p>“Hey Tommy!” Agatha calls, poking her head out to talk to the boy who is seated four people away from her. “See if you can stick one of those jumps on this next one!”</p><p>“No! Don’t listen to her!” Rio yells back. Agatha simply snickers as she casually leans back against the chair.</p><p>Once at the top, Alice is making the plan for the final run.</p><p>“So Jen and I will head down to the bottom then we’ll call you when we get there. You two will go down at separate times. Billy will go first. Once he’s done, we’ll wait for an undisclosed amount of time. You and Rio will wait in the lodge. Then Tommy will come down and we will wait for another undisclosed amount of time before we all meet in the lodge to find out the winner.” She lets out a heavy breath once she finishes speaking.</p><p>“Why’d you have to make it so complicated?” Rio groans. “Send 'em both down, first kid that high-fives you at the bottom wins.”</p><p>“Maybe if you could be trusted to not teach Tommy how to clip someone’s skis, then we could do that.” Agatha sneers. Rio just chuckles and elbows Tommy who snickers back.</p><p>“Okay you two can argue about that. We’ll call you when we’re at the bottom.” Jen says and they both take off.</p><p>“Guess we’ll wait over here.” Agatha shrugs and heads over to a bench to sit down. Billy and Tommy both join her while Rio opts to plop herself into the snow.</p><p>“Eat one of your bars.” Agatha points to Billy’s pocket where he usually keeps a protein bar.</p><p>Rio slaps Tommy’s leg. “You too.”</p><p>While the boys fuel up, Rio begins digging at the snow infront of her, not looking up as she begins talking, clearly to Agatha. “So do you ride normal or goofy?”</p><p>Agatha swears she can hear her grin.</p><p>“I don’t know and we’re not gonna find out.” She sneers back. Kicking at Rio's knee, not enough to do any damage but enough that she winces and chucks a loose handful of snow back at her face.</p><p>After about ten minutes, Agatha gets the call to send Billy down first.</p><p>“You got this.” She turns him so Rio and Tommy can’t hear them. “Remember to take Rune. That’ll shave off at least a minute or two.”</p><p>“But that's a black.” He squeaks.</p><p>“It’s just steep, there aren’t any rocks or anything. Even if you fall, you can get back up and still save time.” She says sternly, basically giving him no other choice. He takes off, straightlining until he disappears over a lip and the three of them can no longer see him.</p><p>Tommy sits down to strap in for his run.</p><p>“Hold up Tom, this might be awhile.” Rio says, pulling an annoyed grumble from Agatha.</p><p>They have no idea how long it’s been when they finally get the call telling them to send Tommy down.</p><p>“This is your time to shine kid.” Rio cheers. “Those turns are still important but your need for speed is your best friend now.” She says and he smiles wickedly before heading off.</p><p>“He’s off.” Rio says into the phone and hangs up. “So… what are we gonna do?” She steps closer to Agatha.</p><p>Agatha raises her brows. “We’re gonna wait another hour until we get the all clear.” She says, going over to pull her skis off the rack, mostly to just busy herself.</p><p>Rio jogs to cut in front of her. “Let me, m’lady.” She grins, reaching to grab the womans skis before she can, also snatching up her board.</p><p>With a scoff, Agatha allows her to carry her skis as they walk back over to the bench to wait until they can make their way down.</p><p>The two of them sit in silence for a while. It’s not quite comfortable but it is calm for once. That is until Rio decides to open her big mouth.</p><p>“I was thinking about proposing an addition to our little wager.” She tilts her chin up, waiting for Agatha to give her the go ahead.</p><p>“Oh great, You want to throw money on it don’t you?”</p><p>“Nope.” She pops the P “When I win…” She pulls off her goggles, revealing telling eyes. “You have to go on a date with me.” She says, not quite serious but not quite joking.</p><p>Agatha lifts her eyebrows in surprise and then spits out a, “Ha!” in her face. She is forcefully laughing for several seconds, even throwing in the motion of wiping away a tear. “Fine. But only because I know you’re not gonna win.”</p><p>“Okay.” Rio shrugs, surprisingly not fighting back about winning. She instead yanks her hand out of her glove for a handshake. Agatha gives it a firm shake before quickly retracting her own hand. Rio holds that smug smile on her face for the next twenty minutes until they are finally called to make their way down.</p><p>“See ya!” Rio calls and takes off before Agatha has the chance to get her pole straps around her wrists. When they would usually race the whole way down, Agatha chooses not to. She instead focuses on taking the route she mapped out for Billy, just to give herself a little reassurance before they find out who won. Knowing Rio, she most likely is taking every single black down which will inevitably get her down faster and give her a false hope that her and Tommy won. When Agatha makes it to the bottom, she heads straight into the lodge where everyone is waiting for her.</p><p>“Alright, let's hear it.” Agatha rubs her hands together, staring both Alice and Jen down with anticipation.</p><p>“Alice and I need some time to talk it over and compare scores.” Jen says as they both walk off to make their decision.</p><p>“Oh c’mon you couldn’t have done that while we were coming down!?” Agatha yells and tosses her hands up in detest.</p><p>“Well responsible Ski instructors wouldn’t leave their kids unattended.” Jen sneers.</p><p>“They’re teens, they’re fine.” Rio brushes it off. The two of them don't reply and continue on to find a private place to convigne.</p><p>“I won.” Rio says the second they walk away, leaning into Agatha's space, making it so their goggles on top of their helmets are nearly touching.</p><p>Agatha shakes her head. “No way. I totally won.”</p><p>Billy cuts in. “Uh, can we remember who actually did the race?”</p><p>“Yeah!” Tommy agrees they should be given most of the credit.</p><p>“You two.” Agatha points to each of them. “Are simply our hamsters.” She says, making Rio chuckle at the blunt statement.</p><p>“What the hell?” Billy snaps.</p><p>“Hey! You still learned how to ski!” She yelps, throwing her hands in the air. “And thanks to you, I’m gonna have this one in ski boots on monday.” Agatha jabs her thumb towards Rio who snaps her jaw to pretend to bite it.</p><p>“Okay we only did three runs, how long does it take to decide who won?” Tommy asks, dramatically groaning after.</p><p>Five grueling minutes later, Jen and Alice finally return.</p><p>“We have our decision!” Jen announces in a fancy voice while Alice is smiling widely next to her.</p><p>“The winner of the Agatha and Rio are annoying as fuck competition is…” The two of them drum on their thighs, the slapping sound mostly muffled by their snow pants. They’re sure to drawl it out just to piss off the two women a little extra.</p><p>“BILLY!” Alice yells.</p><p>Agatha doesn't waste a second as she yelps. “YES!”</p><p>“Really!” Billy gasps in disbelief.</p><p>“You killed it kid.” Alice nods.</p><p>Billy throws himself into a hug with Agatha which she is too happy about beating Rio to reject.</p><p>“Take that!” She rubs it in the other woman’s face.</p><p>Rio just scowls back at her. Agatha is too caught up in the moment to notice the slight smile the other woman is fighting to contain. Once Agatha is done mindlessly hollering and throwing her hands around, she turns back to Rio who has managed to pull that smirk into a simple plain look.</p><p>“Awww, are you sad your kid wasn’t as good as mine?” Agatha juts out her lip in a fake pout.</p><p>Rio looks her up and down, still choosing to stay silent. She then turns to Tommy, “Y’know what Tom? Yeah, let's hit that terrain park next week. Show your bro up there.” Rio nudges him, making the boy softly smile.</p><p>“Congrats Bill.” He pulls his brother into a hug.</p><p>“It really was close.” Jen assures him and Tommy nods back to say there are no hard feelings.</p><p>At the end of the day, In the locker room, Agatha is still pestering Rio with her victory.</p><p>“Remember that time my kid kicked your kid's ass?”</p><p>Rio is still choosing to stay as silent as possible, hoping that alone is enough to piss Agatha off.</p><p>“You’re gonna look so stupid in the boots.” Agatha snickers as she pictures Rio waddling around the town.</p><p>Rio raises her eyebrows at her.</p><p>Agatha has picked up on Rio's attempt to annoy her with her silence so she makes her own plan. “Y’know, I think I like you quiet.” She looks her up and down. “Maybe that date isn’t such a bad idea.” She steps into her space, walking her fingers up her shoulder, changing to a whisper. “Too bad you lost.” She hums.</p><p>That miraculously gets Rio to speak. “You’re the loser. I’m a real catch.”</p><p>Agatha simply hums back, refusing to give her any sort of satisfaction which she’d get no matter how she responded.</p><p>”Just you wait, I’ll probably end up better at skiing than you are.” Rio smirks, jutting out her neck in yet another challenge.</p><p>“Whatever motivates you sweetie.” Agatha slings her bag over her shoulder. “Rest up tomorrow.” She pats Rio’s cheek. “Monday is gonna be one long day for you.” She says over her shoulder as she saunters away.</p>

<p>“Thanks Herb.” Agatha says to the employee as she and Rio make their way to the back of the resort's rental shop.</p><p>“Sit down.” Agatha points to the raised bench where Rio huffs as she steps up and sits down. “Put these on.” She chucks a pair of long thin ski socks at the woman.</p><p>“My socks are fine.” Rio holds them away from her.</p><p>“No they’re not, they’re too thick. Put them on.” She commands her. Rio of course follows suit. While she does that, Agatha goes and digs around, returning with a foot measurer.</p><p>“Good girl.” Agatha throws on an extra tantalizing voice when she sees Rio followed directions.</p><p>“Just measure my foot.” She sticks her leg out. Agatha takes her foot, placing it in the instrument, then the other one so she can get her exact measurements.</p><p>“Ooookay. I’ll be right back.” Agatha smiles, patting Rio’s knee as she gets up to retrieve the right boots.</p><p>Minutes later, the woman is back. “Here.” Agatha slams a pair of boots in front of the woman, waiting for her to do something. “Well go on, put em on.”</p><p>Rio huffs and pulls them closer to her, proceeding to try to shove her foot in like it's a snowboard boot.</p><p>“How the fuck do you put these on!?” She yelps, angrily pulling at the shell.</p><p>Agatha chuckles. “Try unbinding them.” She watches as Rio does just that. “Now pull ‘em open.” She once again follows instructions. “Stand up and step in.”</p><p>Rio shoves her foot into the boot with a grunt.</p><p>“Good job!” Agatha teases, Rio responds by sticking her tounge out at the woman. “Tap so your heel is in place.” She once again listens. “Now hurry up, do the other one.”</p><p>She finishes pulling the boots on, already complaining about how uncomfortable they are. “Number one reason skiing sucks? These dumb ass things.” She shakes her foot, making the bindings clack together.</p><p>“You’re not wrong about that.” Agatha for once agrees, pulling up a stool to now help her secure her bindings. She immediately gets to work without explaining anything to the woman who yelps as she tightens them.</p><p>“Oh shut it you big baby.” Agatha scolds, smacking her knee.</p><p>“Jesus, does it have to be that tight?” She turns her foot to look at the bindings.</p><p>“If you don’t want to break your ankles, yeah.” She moves on, doing the same with the next boot.</p><p>“Stand up.” Rio does just that. “Now keep your heels on the ground and lean forward.” Agatha demonstrates herself. “Do your toes pull back just a little?” Rio nods. “Great, you’re already doing so good.” She boops Rio on the nose, quickly turning around, causing her to miss the blush that hits her cheeks.</p><p>“Alright! I think one of these should work for you.” Agatha comes over with two pairs of skis, taking a turn holding each pair up to Rio to measure them.</p><p>“Chin up sweetheart.” She nods, giving Rio no time to tilt her own head up before she’s gently curling her fingers under her chin, forcing her to look straight forward.</p><p>“You’re getting real cocky about this.” Rio points out, clenching her jaw.</p><p>“Oh yeah.” She agrees. “I’m enjoying every second of this.” She hums. “Rio Vidal will finally meet her match. Ugh, it really warms the heart.”</p><p>That makes Rio snap, she quickly grabs Agatha's wrist, nearly making her drop the skis. They don’t exchange words, Agatha simply gazes back at her with a challenging look in her eye, tilting her head as if to say. “I dare you.”</p><p>Rio releases her hand with a huff, returning to her position so she can finish the fitting. Agatha bites back a laugh at Rio's compliance, and chooses to move on, although she most definitely takes note of the interaction.</p><p>“These are the ones.” Agatha decides. She goes and collects the boots and takes them back out to the technician so they can adjust the bindings.</p><p>“And last, poles.” She brings a few more pairs up, easily finding the ones that just reach Rio’s armpits.</p><p>“I am not using stupid poles.” Rio refuses.</p><p>Agatha almost forces her to bring them up anyways but the chance of seeing Rio regret her choice is a lot more tempting.</p><p>“Okay.” She shrugs and returns them to their rack.</p><p>They finish getting ready and head off to hit the mountain.</p><p>“Jesus Christ these things are awful!” Rio groans as she trudges her way over to Agatha who is dying laughing at the woman’s awkward walk.</p><p>“What do you mean? Those bad boys have great mobility!” She continues laughing.</p><p>Rio continues to step with great precision, her boots clunking down hard as she’s forced into an awkward speed walk.</p><p>Agatha toys with her bottom lip, looking Rio up and down. “Y’know, I think I prefer you less mobile.”</p><p>“I can still kick you with these on.” Rio snaps back, swinging her foot for emphasis.</p><p>“Do that and I’m taking you to backcountry.” Agatha threatens as she passes Rio, the woman trudging after her. “Pick up the pace sweetheart!” She calls over her shoulder, gaining a disapproving grumble from Rio.</p><p>Halfway through the gondola ride, They make it to the mid station where there is a drop off for the bunny hill. “Alright let's go.” Agatha begins to stand as the doors open.</p><p>“Absolutely fucking not.” Rio spits. “You won’t catch me dead on the bunny hill.” She states, crossing her arms for emphasis.</p><p>“You sure? I can hold your hands on your way down.” Agatha juts out her lip in a mocking pout. Rio stays silent but Agatha can see her biting back a response by prodding at the inside of her cheek with her tongue. Agatha sits back down, snickering as she successfully pissed Rio off.</p><p>At the main unloading station, Agatha laughs when Rio tries to hold her skis by the bindings like she does. But she accidentally grabs the wrong one and they slip out from each other. She watches in amusement as the woman has to clamber to keep them from falling, all while trying to step off of the moving gondola. Agatha doesn't hold back, loudly laughing in her face.</p><p>“It’s cute that you tried to copy me.” She says, leaving Rio her own devices. Rio eventually gets the skis slatted back together again but chooses to pinch them together in order to carry them. She continues on where she finds Agatha, waiting for her at the top of the learner lift. There are two small runs to choose from, one leads to the magic carpet and the other leads to a short two seater chair lift at the bottom.</p><p>“Okay, before we get going, let's get you on the basics.” Agatha starts her coaching speil.</p><p>Rio scoffs. “I think I can figure out pizza.”</p><p>Agatha wants to fight back and force her to listen to her full routine when teaching a beginner how to ski but Rio’s cocky and stubborn confidence is all too tempting to test.</p><p>“Okay, then do it.” She gestures for Rio to click in.</p><p>Rio sneers back at her, yanking the skis apart and slapping them onto the ground, paying no mind to how far apart they land. She shoves one toe in and then slips when she tries to stamp her heel down.</p><p>Agatha's arms are still crossed while she watches, trying not to laugh. “Uphill ski first sweetheart.”</p><p>“Stop calling me that.” Rio huffs, switching to the other foot.</p><p>“There you go!” Agatha claps once she’s clipped into the first ski. Rio then realises her mistake and has to hobble herself over to the other ski. Once she’s clipped into both, she begins to slide backwards but she’s able to miraculously stop herself.</p><p>Once she regains her balance, Agatha simply stares her down, waiting for the woman to prove her claim. Rio is clearly trying to psych herself up without Agatha noticing but her visible breath quickly gives her away.</p><p>“Go on Papa John, make a pizza.”</p><p>That stupid insult does it for her and she begins to head down. She keeps her skis straight for all of two feet then she instantly forms the pizza position.</p><p>“You look great!” Agatha yells to the woman who is awkwardly making her way down in a hard Pizza, her arms outstretched like one of her five year olds.</p><p>“Shut up!” Rio yells back. Agatha allows Rio to skidd down a few more feet before she slides in front of her, forcing her to come to a stop.</p><p>They’re now stationed just inches away from each other. Agatha leans forward on her poles, making it so she’s almost completely engulfing Rio's space. They are so close that Rio can see Agatha's bright eyes through her usually reflective goggles.</p><p>“Are you ready to listen now, Shaun White?” Agatha teases.</p><p>Rio responds by blowing a delicate breath into Agatha's face, snickering when she scrunches her nose.</p><p>“Great. Now, listen up. Your control is in your uphill ski.” She pats that leg. “That is what you use to turn and that is where you need to push your weight.” She demonstrates a simple turn.</p><p>While Rio was planning on pure natural ability to suddenly bring her to olympic level skiing, she finds herself reluctantly accepting Agatha's coaching. She copies the move, nearly falling over.</p><p>“There you go, now do it again.” This time Agatha waves for her to go ahead so she can watch. Rio is able to repeat the action although she still stumbles on the initial turn.</p><p>“Keep it going sweetheart.” Agatha calls, laughing when she sees Rio huff out a breath, mostly likely at the pet name. She tries to replicate the turn again but ends up catching an edge and falling to the ground. She quickly recovers, hoisting herself up with her elbows.</p><p>Agatha pulls up to her of course laughing. “If you’re not falling, you’re not trying!” She mocks Rios saying.</p><p>“Only I get to say that.” She says pointedly, although she’s been saying it to herself in her head since they got on the lift. “Having your feet on two separate sticks is so fucking dumb.” She grumbles, dusting the snow off of her.</p><p>“Having your feet strapped to one plank is what's insane. Get up.” She taps her in the back with her pole.</p><p>In line for the beginner chair lift, Agatha is laughing when Rio can hardly keep herself from sliding into the person in front of her. “You’re a natural.”</p><p>“Y’know, I wish I took the poles so I could hit you with them.”</p><p>“That and you wouldn’t be scrambling to not clip the dude in front of you.” She points to where Rios skis are sliding over the snowboard of the person in front of her. Rio huffs and waddles her way back.</p><p>“Let's just do that ten more times.” Agatha smiles when Rio groans.</p><p>“I’m putting my board on after lunch.”</p><p>“No you’re not.” Agatha wags a finger in her face. “You signed up for a full lesson.”</p><p>Rio tosses her head back, dramatically groaning.</p><p>With every small run, Rio progresses. But not without several wipeouts that leave Rio covered in snow and Agatha cackling behind her.</p><p>“Quit trying to act like you know what you're doing.” Agatha scolds her.</p><p>“I’m not doing pizza anymore.” She tries to push herself back up and fails.</p><p>“You actually still are.” Agatha points out. “Just because you hit Pizza last minute doesn't mean you’re not using it.”</p><p>“Whatever, That's the only <em>real<em></em> difference between a beginner and an expert.” She tries to insult Agatha but her awkward squat fails to keep her cocky persona up.</em></p><p>“Another reason to use poles.” Agatha says, holding out a stick for the woman to use to pull herself up. “Okay, You have to hit this three times, no falling, before we go get lunch.”</p><p>“Easy.” Rio starts going again but of course gets overconfident and catches an edge.</p><p>“So easy.” Agatha lightly shakes her head and goes ahead to watch from the bottom. After her three required runs turn into six, the pair is finally stomping their way into the bustling lodge.</p><p>“Get these torture devices off of me!” Rio flops into a chair and begins to frantically unclip her bindings, letting out a dramatic sigh when her feet are finally free.</p><p>“Don’t be that guy.” Agatha shakes her head, slapping her bare foot with her glove.</p><p>“If I can get a break from those awful things, I'm taking it.” Rio pushes the boots over for good measure.</p><p>“Whatever, you should be relaxing. We’re doing witches road next.”</p><p>“Great.” Rio confidently leans back in her chair. Agatha looks the woman up and down, shaking her head at her lounging back like she’s about to be served.</p><p>“I’m not getting your food for you.” Agatha snarks as she stands to go get herself something to eat.</p><p>When she steps into line she bumps into Jen and her private lesson.</p><p>“How’s she doing?”</p><p>“Not horrible.” Agatha plainly answers.</p><p>“So she’s good?”</p><p>“I wouldn’t say that.”</p><p>“Question answered.” Jen says.</p><p>“She’s not awful but she’s definitely not gonna pick it up.” Agatha admits.</p><p>“Oh I didn’t expect her to. How close have you gotten to killing her?”</p><p>“Oh, She listens to me just fine.” Agatha flashes a knowing grin.</p><p>“Ew.” Jen forcefully shudders, gaining a confused look from Agatha when she walks away.</p><p>Agatha eventually returns to the table where Rio is still relaxing like a king, now with her jacket and helmet off. “Don’t get your toes crushed while you’re over there.”</p><p>“Try my best.” Rio slaps the surface of the table and trods off. Agatha watches her, silently appreciating the way her tight underlayer highlights her back muscles.</p><p>Rio returns with a tray full of food, and immediately digs in.</p><p>“All that extra work make you hungry?” Agatha laughs after Rio hasn’t stopped to take a breath after the last five bites.</p><p>“No.” She hisses back, sitting herself up.</p><p>“Mhm.” Agatha smirks back at her.</p><p>“Snowboarding is definitely harder.”</p><p>“Okay.” Agatha bites her lip, holding back a smile.</p><p>“It is! You don’t even know, you haven’t tried it.” Rio bats a hand at her.</p><p>“I don’t need to try it. I won.” Agatha sneers back, watching as she can basically see the smoke coming out of Rios ears.</p><p>“How bout another bet?” Rio casually offers.</p><p>Agatha scoffs. “No way, you sore loser.”</p><p>Rio continues on anyway. “If I don’t fall on the witches road, you have to try snowboarding.”</p><p>Agatha stares back at her, her eyes flickering between Rios, ultimately letting out a bored sigh. “Sure what the hell.” She throws her hands up.</p><p>Rio victoriously pumps a fist in the air.</p><p>“Y’know that's three and a half miles right?”</p><p>“I don’t care, I’m getting you on a snowboard.”</p><p>“Yeah okay.” Agatha lets out a doubtful scoff knowing Rio will most definitely fall.</p><p>Once they gear up again for the second half of the day, it’s not long until Rio is once again whining about the trek over to the top of the witches road.</p><p>“You’re paying for whatever foot therapy I have to go through after this hellish day.”</p><p>Agatha just laughs at her.</p><p>They clip in and head off for the long run. The first small run off the top leads to a long road around the edge of the mountain so the beginners aren’t forced down what would have to be a black.</p><p>“Bet ya wish you had those poles now huh?” Agatha mocks as she pushes past Rio who is trying to use the momentum of swinging her arms to get herself moving. Rio eventually figures out that she can use her skis to push herself along, sort of like she’s on ice skates. She waddles her way up to hear Agatha of course snickering to herself. Rio pauses to try and catch her breath.</p><p>Agatha pats her hard on the back. “A fourth of the way there.” Rio shoves her hand off of her and stands back up, flailing her arms when she nearly loses her balance. Which of course sends Agatha into an obnoxious, clearly forced, laughing fit.</p><p>The road turns into a slight incline that allows for a little speed for them to make it to the next fork in the road. One side continues down an easy green while the other leads to a blue. Agatha looks between the two options, ultimately deciding that her best course of action will be to send her down the blue so she’s more likely to fall. She turns back to check on Rio and notes that she is still heavily relying on pizza since she has decided that straightlining every run and hitting a hard pizza at the very end is considered skiing.</p><p>“You’re gonna need to work on your S turns if you don’t want your calves to fall off at the end of the day.” She once again makes use of her poles and taps the back of Rios leg.</p><p>“Y’know you don’t need to critique my every move. This is a one day thing.”</p><p>“I know.” Agatha hums. “It’s just so fun to boss you around.” She taps her goggles.</p><p>Rio forces a grin onto her face, scrunching her nose and shaking her head before dropping it back down to an unamused frown.</p><p>“Alright, here's your first blue. Let's see those S turns!” Agatha cheers, way over exaggerated.</p><p>“No. I’m done listening to you, I got this.” Rio pushes a wave over her shoulder and suddenly begins to straight line down the run.</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes at the woman and her insatiable need to prove she doesn't need help with anything. She casually takes off after her, skiing down like usual.</p><p>For the first half of the slope, Rio seems to have control of herself until it unexpectedly gets steeper and she finds herself flying down the hill. She focuses on her feet and manages to force her legs into a hard pizza. She tries her best to slow down but she’s going too fast and all Agatha see’s is the woman smacking into a tree and a puff of snow.</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha screams taking off even faster than Rio was going, skidding to a hard stop just above the woman. She quickly jams her poles into her bindings, popping off her skis, tossing her sticks to the side. She gets her arms under the woman, pulling her up and away from the tree. She lies her down in the snow and yanks her phone out of her pocket to call ski patrol while pulling her goggles off. She gets her goggles off, to see the woman slowly opening her eyes just as ski patrol answers. Rio flinches in the bright sun, letting out a pained groan. She can barely comprehend Agatha's half of the conversation.</p><p>“My friend just hit a tree…We’re halfway down witches road…Okay...Yes she’s conscious now, I think she might’ve passed out before I got to her… No, she’s learning… How long?…Okay…no…okay.”</p><p>“Ski patrols on their way.” Agatha frantically tells her.</p><p>All Rio is able to do is continue to groan, slightly turning her head before wincing in pain. Agatha begins to practice all of their safety measures, although she's never had to use them before. She grabs her skiis and plants them in the ground above them in a X formation so they’re easier to spot.</p><p>“Are you okay?” She scrambles back to Rio, looking over her body for any obvious wounds.</p><p>“Oh my fuck.” Rio groans as she, without thinking, tries to roll to her side which only results in her painfully flopping back onto her back.</p><p>“Stop moving!” Agatha scolds her.</p><p>“The fuck happened?” Rio is finally able to open her eyes and Agatha immediately notices her blown pupils, most likely signifying a concussion.</p><p>“You hit a tree you dumbass.” She refrains from slapping her in the arm for once.</p><p>Rio just groans again. Five minutes later, ski patrol is next to them, carefully hoisting Rio onto the sled, safely securing her neck for the ride down. Agatha takes Rio's helmet from one of them after they carefully pull it off.</p><p>“Can you keep up?” The Ski patrol man asks Agatha who frantically nods.</p><p>“Yeah, we’re instructors, it’s our day off.” She clambers her way up to grab her skis.</p><p>“Great, let's go.” The man says and they take off down the mountain.</p><p>Agatha is easily able to keep up but she has to force herself to keep her eyes on the mountain when they keep falling to Rio and her pained face. Her heart is racing, she’s not quite sure why. Rio isn’t anyone special to her but the way this hilarious day has suddenly turned into a nightmare has her questioning her own certainty. Rio’s giant pupils flash in her mind. She was most definitely coming back from being unconscious when she got to her. She shakes away the stories she’s heard over the years on the mountain. People who died after terrible accidents, or became fully paralysed. All she can do right now is keep up and pray that for some fucked up reason and insane desire to commit, Rio is just messing with her.</p>

<p>
<em> “I’m Rio.” She offers her hand for a handshake. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha looks the woman up and down. Her hair is in two braids, sticking out from under a deep maroon beanie. She’s wearing a black hoodie plastered in a small floral print, and forest green snow pants. And accompanying it all is a sly grin and big brown eyes. </em>
</p><p>
<em>“Agatha.” She introduces herself, a slight judging tone in her voice. </em>
</p><p>
<em>“Rio is our newest snowboard instructor.” Lila finishes the introduction. </em>
</p><p>
<em>“I can tell.” Agatha looks her up and down, her eyes returning to Rios to find a slight smirk waiting for her. </em>
</p><p>
<em>“I didn’t think I'd meet such a gorgeous ski instructor.” Rio suddenly says, zero wariness in her words. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Agatha manages to mask the shocked expression fighting its way onto her face, instead replying with a simple, “Oh we’re gonna have fun.” Her tone is sneering and confident, leaning forward slightly. Rio also leans in, way more than Agatha, putting their faces an uncomfortable 3 inches apart. She already knows, five seconds into knowing each other, that Rio’s obvious need for attention and shameless flirting will make for a wildly entertaining toy. </em>
</p><p>“What's your relation?” The nurse asks Agatha as Rio is wheeled into the resort's ER.</p><p>“Uh, we're both instructors. It’s our day off.” She quickly spits out.</p><p>“And you saw what happened?”</p><p>“Yeah, I was teaching her to ski and she was straight lining and hit a tree.” She quickly tells the story.</p><p>“Well luckily, she’s conscious. We’re gonna get her an x-ray and a CAT scan. We’ll keep you updated.” The nurse informs her before running to catch up with the crew.</p><p><em>“We’ll keep you updated.”</em> Those words make Agatha want to leave as soon as possible. She turns to leave but something washes over her. She shouldn't, no, she can’t just leave Rio completely alone. But another part of her still desires to run. So she lets out a harsh breath and yanks her phone out to tell Jen what happened. She hits send on the text and turns to leave. She knows her and Alice will come running the second they see the message.</p><p>In her hands she’s still holding Rio’s helmet. She goes to set it down, she’ll find it eventually, no one really steals up here. Then she spots the dent on the front and several large scratches along her goggles, causing a shot of guilt to rush into her heart. She thinks about the last hour, she was the one that made her go down that run. Her heart rushes with guilt, she wretches at herself for caring so much. Then before she knows it, she is sitting in a waiting room chair for the next two hours.</p><p>“Are you Agatha?” An unfamiliar nurse asks her.</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Rio asked if you were still here.” She tells her and Agatha's eyebrows rise with surprise. She wills herself to stand, dusting herself off and hesitantly poking her head into the room.</p><p>“You are still here.” Rio lets a gentle smile onto her face.</p><p>“Yeah, I thought I should be able to report to Lilia if you died or not.” She casually replies, gaining a chuckle from the woman. Agatha softly smiles at her, snickering at herself.</p><p>Rio chuckles again. “Oh god she’s gonna be so pissed.” She can’t help but let out a stressed laugh.</p><p>“Oh she’s gonna have both of our asses.” Agatha joins in, relief washing over her as Rio is just the same as she always was.</p><p>Then their attention is caught by the scraping of metal on metal when the curtain is pulled open.</p><p>“Okay Rio,” The doctor enters the room holding a clipboard. “I am going to give you a little quiz and then leave. Then when I come back, I’m going to quiz you again.”</p><p>Rio nods her head to tell her to go on.</p><p>“My middle name is Randal. I like to grow flowers, and my favorite food is Chicken parmesan.” She tells her, watching as Rio tries to commit her words to memory.</p><p>“Okay, I'll be back. Don’t help her.” She says to Agatha pointedly.</p><p>“Now why on earth would I do that?” Agatha looks directly at Rio who playfully shrugs back at her.</p><p>“So…” she takes a few steps closer. “What's the diagnosis?”</p><p>“Not sure yet. They-”</p><p>Agatha quickly cuts her off before she can go on. “It’s been two hours, how do they not know yet?” She asks, throwing her hands up in detest.</p><p>“I don’t know but did you see the guy with the dislocated shoulder!?” Rio beams like a kid who just saw a fire truck drive by.</p><p>Agatha chuckles back at her, rolling her eyes.</p><p>Rio returns to the topic at hand. “X-rays should be back soon. I think a few bruised ribs” she shrugs followed by wincing in pain. “They’re pretty confident I have a concussion too.” She gestures to her head and winces in pain, shooting her head to hold onto her abdomen.</p><p>“Oh I coulda told you about the concussion. You have to see your helmet.” Agatha says, jabbing a thumb over her shoulder. Rio’s eyes widen with excitement from hearing about her trophy. “I’ll go get it.” She turns and walks out of the room</p><p>The second she steps back into the hall, Alice and Jen finally burst into the emergency room. “Where is she?” Alice asks.</p><p>“They still haven’t told us anything. She’s getting checked out. She seems okay though.” Agatha informs them, pointing to her room where they can just barely see Rio’s hair through the crack in the curtain.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“Well someone decided to try and straightline their first blue on skis.” Agatha says, rolling her eyes.</p><p>“Shocker.” Jen joins her in the motion. “Is she hurt?”</p><p>“I don’t know. I’m guessing concussion, fracture somewhere maybe.” She shrugs at her own loose diagnosis. “They gave her an X-ray and a CAT scan. Results should be back soon.”</p><p>After that information, Alice takes the opportunity to go see the woman.</p><p>“How are you doing?” Jen asks, causing Agatha to suddenly whip her head to look at her, eyebrows furrowed with confusion. Jen takes that expression as a cue to elaborate.<br/>
“I mean, you’re standing out here when you most definitely could just leave. And you’re looking at the side of her head like she’s a deer you hit with your car.” Jen efficiently dissects her brain.</p><p>“I just want to be here to tell Lila what happened.” She recalls the lame excuse.</p><p>“Mhm.” Jen hums, slowly nodding her head in disbelief, silently walking into the room as well.</p><p>Agatha anxiously paces the lobby, playing with her lip. She stays in the hall, something about all of them being in there with her brings her reluctance to call it friendships to a halt. While shes pacing, she can’t help but overhear what she can only assume is the doctor returning with her questions.</p><p>“Okay, What is my middle name?”</p><p>Agatha thinks up the answer in her own mind.</p><p>“Randal.” Rio tells her.</p><p>“What's the hobby I told you about?”</p><p>“Gardening.”</p><p>“Yup.”</p><p>“And what is my favorite food?”</p><p>There's a pause and she can see Rio throw her hands up. “Ah fuck man I don’t know.”</p><p>Agatha chokes back a laugh until she suddenly hears a familiar voice behind her. “Where is she?”</p><p>She whips around to see Lilia, stomping inside with a strange mix of anger and concern washing over her features.</p><p>“She’s okay, they’re still checking her out.” She quickly but casually informs her.</p><p>“This is why when you have a day off, YOU TAKE THE DAY OFF!” Lila nearly yells at her, stomping into the room. Agatha throws her arms back, mostly to physically emphasize that she really doesn't care what Lilia has to say.</p><p>Soon after that, Jen and Alice are walking back out.</p><p>“Lilia made us leave.” Alice tells Agatha. “Let us know what they say.” She requests and the two of them reluctantly exit the building.</p><p>That makes Agatha take her opportunity to step back into the room, forcing down a laugh at Rio already arguing with Lilia.</p><p>“Lilia, I’m fine, I’m sure it’s just a minor concussion and I'll be back in like a week or something.” She casually brushes it off with a bat at the air, resulting in a painful wince.</p><p>Lila crosses her arms and stares the woman down. “The only person that will tell you when you can come back is me and that doctor.” Lilia points out to the hall, conveniently right as the doctor walks in.</p><p>The woman smiles. “So I have your x-rays.” She holds up a folder.</p><p>“Oh great, you're showing me them. What is it? Fracture?” She casually asks, still brushing off the incident like all she did was catch an edge</p><p>“Three broken ribs.” The woman clarifies.</p><p>”What?” Rio’s eyes widen and her jaw drops in disbelief.</p><p>“Yeah.” The doctor pulls out the pictures to show the woman. “These two together down here are called false ribs.” She points to her lower left ribs. “They’re easier to break.” She explains, Rio slowly nodding her head along. “and this one over here.” She points to one lower on the right. “This is a true rib, which is more difficult to break.” She gives her a sympathetic grin when she’s done.</p><p>“This is why you take the day OFF!” Lilia states again.</p><p>Agatha breaks her silence. “Lilia, if you're not going to be helpful, then leave.” The snaps, pointing to the curtain. The woman drops her jaw in shock and snaps her head to look at Rio who is clearly silently agreeing with Agatha's statement. She unwillingly leaves, clearly already prepping the words she will have for Agatha the next time she sees her. The two women share a quick understanding glance before Rio turns her attention back to the doctor.</p><p>“Well shit. What do I have to do?”</p><p>“There's not much we can do. We can’t put a cast on it. The only way to heal is to limit your movement for about a week and a half. Then it will take another five weeks before you're completely healed. Do you live with anyone?” The doctor asks.</p><p>Rio shakes her head. “Just me.”</p><p>“Well, is there anyone that could stay with you for a few days and help you adjust?”</p><p>Rio shakes her head again. “I’m tough.”</p><p>“It's not a question of toughness.” The doctor says knowingly. If you want to heal, you have to rest and move minimally for the first few days.” She states.</p><p>Agatha is silently standing in the corner, inexplicably considering the insane idea of being the one to help Rio. She thinks about it for a while, Alice or Jen would probably help out if she asked but knowing them, they’re no match for Rio's stubbornness. Then, she does have a guest room and a convenient excuse to also take off work for the next few days. And finally, a small ping of guilt for being the one to send her down the run in the first place.</p><p>“You can stay with me.” She suddenly offers, rejecting the words the second they leave her mouth.</p><p>“What?” Rio tries to use her elbows to prop herself up but winces in pain and falls back onto the bed.</p><p>“Yeah.” She turns to the doctor. “I’ll make sure she actually does what she’s supposed to.” She assures the woman.</p><p>“Agatha, I'm fine.” Rio states.</p><p>“See, her stubborn ass needs me.” Agatha says to the doctor and they both laugh.</p><p>“Okay well, she has a moderate concussion as well.”</p><p>“Oh my god kill me.” Rio throws her head back, resulting in another yelp of pain.</p><p>“You need to stop moving.” The doctor sternly says, then she turns back to Agatha. “So I'll give you a concussion information pamphlet. That’ll tell you everything you need to know. Mainly, just keep the lights low. That means no screens for a week.”</p><p>“What!?” Rio yelps. “The hell am I supposed to do then!?”</p><p>“You can bear to not fry your brain for a week.” Agatha mocks her. “I’ll get you crosswords.”</p><p>“Yup, no loud music or sounds or anything. And as for your ribs, ice them in twenty minute increments, you need to walk around and roll your shoulders sixty minutes a day. I’ll give you some pain killers and it will take at least five weeks after that until you will be completely healed. By week two you should be up and functioning like normal but you cannot snowboard for the rest of the season.” She rifles out the information.</p><p>“What!?” Rio yelps for what seems like the hundredth time.</p><p>“You cannot risk making your fracture worse or getting second impact syndrome.” The doctor says sternly.</p><p>“You just get to be a pretty princess.” Agatha mocks the woman who just sticks her tounge out at her.</p><p>“In all reality, both injuries are simply dependent on you relaxing and allowing your body to fix itself.” She truthfully tells the woman. “Let me go get your meds and get you checked outta here.” The doctor flashes a toothy grin and backs out of the room.</p><p>Rio turns her attention back to Agatha. “You’re very funny.”</p><p>“What’s funny?”</p><p>“Your whole offer to stay with me? Thanks actually. Now doc over there thinks I won’t be binging all the Purge movies tonight.” She slowly sits herself up and turns to she’s sitting on the edge of the bed, albeit, clearly still in a lot of pain.</p><p>“It wasn’t a joke.” Agatha responds.</p><p>Rio’s eyes flicker with something curious and they grow a little wider, maybe in surprise. “There's not room at my place.” She tries to reason.</p><p>“Who said your place? I’m taking you home with me.” Agatha tells her, leaving no room for protest. Rio is simply staring back at the woman in pure disbelief.</p><p>“I’ll go grab our stuff from the locker room and come back for you.” She simply informs her, leaving the room without another word. When the doctor comes back, he finds Rio sat at the edge of the bed in some sort of daze, trying to comprehend everything that just happened.</p>

<strong> Day 1 </strong>
</p><p>“Agathaaaaa.” Rio whines like a five year old. “I’m fucking fine, all you have to do is help me ice.” She continues complaining all while still bending to Agatha's will as she slowly helps her into her guest bed.</p><p>“The main reason you’re actually here is so you don’t take it upon yourself to decide you’re healed after two days.” She says, grabbing extra pillows and shoving them behind Rio so she can sit up more comfortably.</p><p>“I already feeeeeeel fine.” She stretches, trying and failing to conceal the shock of pain that suddenly ripples through her.</p><p>“That’s called paracetamol.” Agatha shakes her head.</p><p>Rio scoffs then takes a second to look around the room. It’s in this moment that she fully processes that she is indeed inside Agatha’s house right now.</p><p>“Full honesty? I have no fucking clue how I got here.” Rio says, still in a slight post concussion daze.</p><p>“This is my house and this is your room.” Agatha simply tells her. “I’ll be back.” She leaves the room.</p><p>Rio continues to look around. There's not much to see. The only decor is a large photo of the woods on the wall and a lamp on the dresser. That is until her eyes find the last corner of the room where she sees a medium sized cage. She tries her best to look into the cage but it’s just out of view.</p><p>When Agatha returns, Rio immediately points to the cage. “The fuck is that?”</p><p>“Oh.” She can hear the regret in Agatha’s voice. “That's my bunny.”</p><p>“Bunny? No fucking way.” Rio laughs.</p><p>“Yes fucking way.” Agatha places the ice down and walks over to get the animal. She pulls a medium sized fluff ball, white with brown spots, out of the cage and holds him close to her chest, scratching the top of his head, making his ears drop. “This is senior scratchy.”</p><p>“Okay, you’re totally fucking with me.” Rio is still forcefully laughing. That is until she sees the annoyance on Agatha’s face. “You’re serious? Senior scratchy?” She raises her eyebrows.</p><p>“Yup, your roommate.” She holds him up by the armpits.</p><p>“And Agatha Harkness gets more complicated by the second.” Rio shakes her head and reaches out to gently pet the animal.</p><p>Agatha then decides to set the animal on Rio who screams the second she lets go of him. Agatha quickly yanks him back up, laughing maniacally.</p><p>“Aw, are you scared of a little bunny?” She mocks her while Rio is still recovering.</p><p>“No! You just put your fatass rabbit on my THREE BROKEN RIBS!” Rio snaps back.</p><p>Agatha winces in regret then opts to set him on the floor so he can roam freely like he usually does while she’s home. She considers apologizing for a second but she knows Rio will get over it. She never apologised for pushing her off the lift. She then moves to sit on the bed so she can help Rio ice.</p><p>“Take your shirt off.” She commands.</p><p>Rio drops her jaw, pretending to be in shock. “We haven’t even been on a date yet.” She places a hand to her chest for good measure.</p><p>Agatha lets out a small chuckle and rolls her eyes. “Just do it.” She says and Rio follows suit, wincing as she carefully pulls her shirt over her head. Agatha watches the display, at first taken back by the toned muscles on Rio's stomach then when her shirt rides higher, she see’s deep dark bruises covering a large part of her rib cage. She can’t help but let a sympathetic smile hit her face. She shakes away the guilt in her throat and<br/>
moves in with the ice, just slow enough that Rio can barely brace for contact.</p><p>“Shit! Fuck! That hurts!” Rio yelps, slapping Agatha's hand away.</p><p>“Oh I'm sorry, would you rather me throw you shirtless into the snow?” She rhetorically asks, pressing the ice back to her ribs, ignoring her yelp of pain once again.</p><p>Rio sucks in air through her teeth as she adjusts to the uncomfortable temperature. After a few seconds, Agatha can see her relax, her shoulders slowly returning to their normal position.  Agatha reaches out to the side table where she set some athletic tape. She urges Rio tp sit up, then begins to wrap the ice pack so neither of them have to hold it.</p><p>“So what am I supposed to do all day tomorrow?” Rio asks, trying to not make a joke about Agatha repeatedly wrapping her arms around her. Agatha tilts her head back so they’re face to face, ridiculously close as Agatha is still working on securing the wrap.</p><p>“Well, first off, I will be hiding all the remotes from you.” She smiles when Rio glares at her. “I think there are some puzzles in the closet. Maybe the newspaper has something for you?” She shrugs, Rios entertainment is not her problem.</p><p>“Well I have my phone.” Rio holds up the device proudly.</p><p>“And when that dies?”</p><p>“Find those remotes.” Rio grins back at her.</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes as she finishes up securing the ice pack. Rio expects her to back away but she instead leans closer. Rios eyes go wide in surprise but she keeps her head exactly where it is, waiting for contact. But instead of soft lips meeting hers, it’s a blaring light shining in her face.</p><p>“Fuck!” She yells, shutting her eyes on instinct.</p><p>“Open your eyes! I have to show you what they look like!” Agatha scolds her, trying to manually open her eyes for her. She takes a quick video with the flash on, then turns it around so Rio can see her absolutely enormous pupils.</p><p>“And that is why we’re keeping the lights off and you are banned from all screens.” Agatha flashes a grin and stands up with a pat to Rios knee.</p><p>“I’ll heat you up some food. You get what you get.” She says, laughing as she leaves the room.</p><p>Rio lets herself sink into the pillows, letting out a deep sigh that is of course painful. She didn’t realise how much your ribs are involved in everything your body does. She stares straight up at the ceiling, taking time to fully process the day. She’s in Agatha's house, she’s staying in Agatha's house…She’s shirtless in Agatha's house.</p><p>
<strong> Day 2 </strong>
</p><p>The next morning, Agatha wakes up and follows her normal morning routine until she sees the athletic tape on the counter and remembers who’s here. She then reluctantly drags herself into her guest room to help Rio ice. Asking herself, “Why the hell did I volunteer for this?”</p><p>Rio is wide awake when she steps into the room. “Good morning!” Rio beams, purely because if Agatha's crankiness every morning in the locker room means anything, Agatha is not a morning person.</p><p>“Morning.” Agatha grumbles back at her, wasting no time as Rio kept her shirt off to sleep. She gets to work securing her ice pack around her.</p><p>Once she’s finished, she quickly stands back up. “I’ll come back and put those back in the freezer before I leave.” She points and leaves the room.</p><p>“Where are you going? I thought you were off?”</p><p>Agatha lets out a deep annoyed sigh. “Lilia is only letting me take today off so I have things I need to get done.”</p><p>“And you listened to her?” Rio lifts her eyebrows in disbelief.</p><p>Agatha nods back. “For some reason.” She steps forward. “But don’t you worry. I’ll be back to take care of you.” She juts out her lip into a pouty face, accompanied by the most dramatic voice possible.</p><p>“Oh thank god.” Rio reaches out to her but Agatha steps back before she can get a hold of her hand.</p><p>“I’m gonna run by your place. What do you need?”</p><p>“My shark pants!” Rio suddenly yelps, pure joy radiating off of her.</p><p>“Shark pants?”</p><p>“Yeah! They’re my favorite!” Rio beams. “They’re like sweatpants slash pj pants and they have little sharks all over them!” She describes the item like its starry night.</p><p>Agatha lets out a small chuckle. “You don’t want anything else?”</p><p>“I mean, one of my pillows, charger, couple changes of clothes.” Rio lists off the other things.</p><p>“Okay, I will be back with… shark pants.” She audibly rolls her eyes. “and other necessities.”</p><p>Rio is still beaming, and Agatha can’t help but let a small smile tug at her lips.</p><p>“Here. So you don’t starve.” She tosses a granola bar into Rio's lap.</p><p>“Oh, a five star meal.”</p><p>Agatha just rolls her eyes and walks out of the room.</p><p>”I’ll miss you!” Rio yells after her, followed by an entertained snicker.</p><p>Agatha scours around for Rio's house keys. She checks her gear from yesterday, all of the surfaces she might’ve placed them on and when she fails to find them, she trods back into the guest room. “Where are your keys?”</p><p>“Probably my locker.” Rio answers, knowing that will piss the woman off. Sure enough, it does.</p><p>“What!?”</p><p>“Hey! You said you would grab my stuff! I assumed that was included!” Rio yelps back.</p><p>Agatha lets out a disgruntled groan and stomps out of the room without another word.</p><p>“You don’t know where I live!” Rio calls after her, Agatha stomps back over to the door, sneering. “I’ll figure it out.” Before slamming the door.</p><p>The whole drive over to the resort, Agatha is grumbling to herself as if it’s concussed Rio’s fault she failed to grab her keys.</p><p>“What are you doing here?” Jen asks when Agatha appears in the locker room.</p><p>“I need Rio’s keys.” She swings her locker open and begins digging around. “And I need you to send me her address.”</p><p>“You didn’t have Rio send it to you?”</p><p>“No way am I giving that woman my number.” She’s still digging around the surprisingly messy locker.</p><p>“Okay weirdo.” Jen drops it and sends the address over.</p><p>Agatha finally finds the keys. “Thanks.” She says, walking past Jen.</p><p>“How’s she doing?” Jen asks. Agatha conceals her annoyance as she’s trying to leave before Lilia spots her and accuses her of lying about helping Rio.</p><p>“Fine.” She huffs. “Still the same pain in my ass she always is.”</p><p>“Well that's good. And you?”</p><p>Agatha throws her hands up. “Why do you keep asking me that?”</p><p>“Just checking.” Is all Jen says, letting an annoyingly knowing smile creep onto her face.</p><p>“Well stop.” Agatha says, finally turning to actually leave. On her way back out to the parking lot, She passes a few familiar faces, sure to keep her scowl as she ignores each and every one of them.</p><p>When she pulls up to Rio's place, it’s a small apartment. Probably all she can afford with these insane mountain prices. She lets herself in to find exactly what she expected. The place is small and filled with every plant known to man. She’s surprised there aren’t bees and butterflies flying around. The place isn’t as messy as her locker. At least she keeps her living space somewhat manageable. It’s cozy. She could see herself waking up to the golden sun shining through the windows, giving the plants a natural glow. Wait. What the fuck is she doing fantasizing about waking up in Rios apartment? She psychically shudders to shake the idea from her head.</p><p>After locating a duffle bag, she heads to the bedroom and begins to toss anything she thinks she might want into it, of course checking off the highly requested shark pants. She snags a few books from her side table and a shelf, just in case she wants to actually follow the no screens rule.</p><p>After she gathers the necessities, she makes one more sweep. She checks to make sure nothing is getting its battery fried because Rio thought she would be home like normal. There aren’t any animals to take care of but she looks over the plants, they’re very healthy. Agatha assumes Rio is probably one of those freaks that loves her plants like they’re children. So she finds the largest cup she can and goes around watering everything except for the succulents. She knows very little about keeping plants alive. Rio should be happy to know they won’t die over the next two weeks, so she heads out, sure to lock the door behind her.</p><p>“Here.” she drops the duffle bag onto the side of the bed Rio is not lying on. “And your dumb shark pants.” She chucks them at the woman, covering her face. Rio laughs and pulls them off.</p><p>“Thank you.” She smiles and immediately goes to stand up. But of course, the entire process of standing up is painful, both physically and visually. She eventually gets herself to stand up straight and shucks her shorts off with a grunt.</p><p>“Have you not walked around today yet?” Agatha asks, arms crossed. Rio shakes her head as she gets the pants ready to put on but the second she bends over to put one leg in, she crashes back to sitting on the bed. Agatha watches the display and for a moment, that disgusting feeling of guilt shoots through in her chest. Before she knows it, she's in front of Rio, taking the garment from her hands and kneeling down in front of her.</p><p>“I can do it myself.” Rio reaches out to take the pants back but Agatha swats at her hand with a “Shh.”</p><p>Rio allows her to continue. Agatha bunches up one leg hole and slides it over her foot, and then the next one. She looks back up at Rio who is just staring at her wide eyed.</p><p>“Stand up.”</p><p>Rio complies, slowly rising back to her feet. Agatha hooks her fingers into the waistband then slowly begins to pull her pants up. She tells herself the pace is so she doesn’t hurt her further, not because she’s trying to savor the sight of Rio in nothing but a sports bra and underwear. She pulls them the rest of the way up, sliding the waistband over the curve of her ass. But she’s not done, she tugs at the sweatpants strings, not tight enough that they’re sinched but tight enough that Rio won’t have to worry about them falling down. Her fingers toy with the strings but her eyes stay locked on Rio, reveling in the way she finally has nothing snarky to say to her.</p><p>When the moment ends Agatha solidifies it with one pat to her lower abdomen.</p><p>“Come to the kitchen to get your ice. You need to walk around a little.” Agatha leaves the room, fully confident that Rio is trailing behind her.</p><p>“Can you do it looser this time?” Rio requests as Agatha pulls out an ice pack and the athletic tape. “You’re gonna cut off my circulation.”</p><p>“Oh shut it.” Agatha ignores her request and begins to secure it exactly the same way she did that morning. Before she places the ice on her skin, she takes a moment to examine the bruises. They’ve only gotten darker. She anxiously bites her lip, pushing that guilty feeling down once again. She looks up to find Rio’s giant pupils staring straight back at her, but they look different than they did in the light of her camera.</p><p>“There. Now you can go lie back down.” Agatha nudges for her to go back to the room. Rio is too shocked by the tension in the last five minutes that she can’t even pretend to resist.</p><p>Agatha watches the woman pathetically trudge back into the room. She can still hear her pain filled sounds through the shut door as she slides back into bed. Rio smacking into the tree suddenly flashes in her mind.</p><p>She could have died. At that speed, she could have cracked her skull open, Broken her back and became paralysed. She’s lucky all she got was a concussion and the broken ribs but that doesn't make Agatha feel any better about the situation she put her in. She should’ve kept her on the green they were on, she should’ve dealt with the fact that she wasn’t horrible at skiing. But she just had to knock her down a peg and she feels awful about it. Gross.</p><p>Agatha stares at the door for a few seconds longer until she unwillingly bursts back into the guest room, not scaring Rio but definitely surprising her. The woman doesn’t say a word, she just frantically paces around at the end of the bed, mumbling to herself. Rio pulls herself to sit up, waiting for whatever explosion this is going to be.</p><p>“You okay?” She finally asks after Agatha covers the same five paces for what feels like the hundredth time.</p><p>“I don’t want to say this.” She finally blurts out. “I REALLY don’t wanna say this.”</p><p>“Okay?” Rio is still insanely confused.</p><p>“You are just so unbelievably aggravating.” She clenches her fists and grits her teeth.</p><p>“You know you’re the one holding me hostage right?” Rio questions, forcing herself to keep from laughing. That does not receive a response like she expected, instead Agatha is still manically pacing the room, her thoughts running rampant.</p><p>“Sorry.” She suddenly spits out.</p><p>“What?” Rio pushes herself to sit up further.</p><p>“I’m the one that sent you down that run and… I am sorry.” Agatha never apologises so the words leave her tongue in the only way she knows, the most proper form. “I am sorry.” It feels so weird.</p><p>Rio is looking at the woman, eyebrows furrowed until she suddenly bursts into laughter.</p><p>“What? Why?” She laughs out.</p><p>Now it’s Agatha's turn to be confused.</p><p>“I told you to go down that blue. I’m the reason this happened.” She explains her thought process again.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio lightly chuckles again. “You didn’t do anything.” She then unexpectedly reaches out and places her hands gently over Agathas, finally stopping her pacing. “I was planning on sending it no matter what you told me.” She laughs, quickly wincing in pain.</p><p>“I just…” She pauses, weighing her next words. “I didn’t want anything bad to happen to you.” She cringes. Why does Rio look so pathetic and cute with an ice pack wrapped around her?</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio says her name again watching as her blue eyes flicker up to meet her brown ones. “I do not blame you at all.” She shakes her head for emphasis. “If this happened when you pushed me off the lift then we’d be having a different conversation but…” Her eyes shift to something more sincere, more assuring. “This was not your fault. I’m the idiot who thought she could ski.” She lightheartedly chuckles and Agatha finally joins in. “I was surprised you were the one who insisted on helping me. I was planning on just sticking it out.”</p><p>“Yeah I know.” Agatha chuckles. The air fills with silence, comfortable silence for once. Neither of them are in a rush to get the last word in or to figure out how to piss the other one off first. They’re just here, and it’s peaceful.</p><p>Agatha breaks the silence when she clears her throat.</p><p>“I uh, I watered your plants.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes light up. “Really?”</p><p>“Yeah, I mean, I hope I didn’t overdo it.”</p><p>Rio watered them on Sunday but the sweet gesture is enough for her to put it aside. They'll be fine. “Thanks.” She smiles, and Agatha for once gets a genuine soft smile creep onto her face.</p><p>
<strong> Day 3 </strong>
</p><p>Agatha arrives home after work and B lines to her own room before going to see Rio, except when she enters her room, the woman is already there.</p><p>“What the fuck are you doing?” Agatha yelps at Rio who is happily propped up in her bed like she owns the place.</p><p>“Your guest room mattress isn’t really fit for rib recovery.” She proudly “informs” her.</p><p>“Yeah well it also isn’t fit for nuisances I already provided a bed for.” Agatha crosses her arms to keep herself from unceremoniously shoving the already wounded woman out of the bed.</p><p>“Aw, is the grinch used to living alone?” Rio throws on a pouty voice.</p><p>“Very.” Agatha goes to pull her out of the bed to which Rio yelps in pain. “You liar.” Agatha continues to pull at her until Rio lets out a sound that actually sounds like it hurts.</p><p>“No for real!”</p><p>“Oh.” Agatha drops her hand and steps back. “Rio, you have to go back to the guest room.” She crosses her arms.</p><p>“Awww c’mon Aggie.” Agatha snarls at the nickname, which of course was Rio’s intention. “Don’t you just feel,” She puts on an extra pouty, nearly childish voice. “So bad about letting me get hurt?” She juts out her lip and bats her eyes.</p><p>“Not bad enough to share by bed.”</p><p>“C’mon! It smells in there!” She snaps back to her usual bratty attitude. “You have me living with a bunny!”</p><p>“Actually,” She holds up one finger. “I have my bunny living with a brat.”</p><p>Rio huffs at that and sinks herself further into the pillows in response.</p><p>“Rio.” Agatha says again sternly.</p><p>“Nope.” She pops the “P”</p><p>Agatha stares the woman down, trying her best not to cave. She could threaten her life, maybe chuck a few snowballs in her face so she has to get up, she even considers pushing the whole mattress off of the bed frame.</p><p>But instead she says, “I’ll be back.” and with that, she steps out of the room. Rio anxiously waits for her return, she could come back with her ice pack or she could return with a gun. It's really anyone's guess.</p><p>When she comes back, she's holding the pillows from Rio's room and a large bowl of popcorn.</p><p>“Give me my pillow back.” She demands Rio who quickly discards it and takes the new pillows.</p><p>“What are we watching?”</p><p>Rio furrows her brows. “I thought I couldn’t watch anything.”</p><p>“I am not sacrificing my evening ritual for your dented brain.” Agatha says, turning on the TV.</p><p>Rio snaps her neck back in shock. She spent the better half of the day searching for the remote and Agatha just pulled it out of thin air. She begins scrolling through the options, way too slow for Rio's liking.</p><p>“God you read at the pace of a five year old holy shit.” She groans but she’s quickly distracted when she sees a familiar title. “Purge Anarchy please!”</p><p>Agatha looks over the movie, she thinks she might’ve seen it once. She isn’t particularly interested in watching it but she does recall Rio saying she was planning on binging the franchise during her time off.</p><p>“Whatever.” Agatha clicks on the title, trying her best to keep up her annoyed facade.</p><p>Rio is beaming like a little kid as the movie starts. Agatha finds herself staring for way too long. Luckily Rio is too engrossed in the screen to notice.</p><p>The movie goes on. Agatha enjoys it for the most part. She even finds herself actually listening when Rio starts ranting about how deep the lore of the franchise actually is. She admits, only to herself, that Rio’s company isn’t all that bad. When there's no one around to impress, the woman is actually very tame.</p><p>When the movie ends, Agatha finds herself yawning.</p><p>“I’m tired.” She turns the TV off.</p><p>She expects Rio to understand the social cue and take herself to the guest room. But alas, the woman is unmoving except for her sliding herself the rest of the way under the covers.</p><p>“Rio, get out.” She bluntly tells her.</p><p>“No. I'm wounded and I'm comfortable.” Rio nuzzles herself into the comforter.</p><p>“Rio.” Agatha says sternly. But she has already shut her eyes and is pretending to be in a deep sleep. Agatha considers taking herself out to the living room to sleep on the couch. But that would mean Rio won and she’ll be damned before she lets that happen.</p><p>So she also sinks into the bed, sure to turn over so her back is to Rio. What she doesn’t account for is her involuntary movements in her sleep. The next morning she wakes up to find herself on her side, now facing Rio with one arm draped over her chest and their legs tangled together. The second she processes the position she's in, she shoots up before Rio also wakes up. She scoffs at herself. Even subconsciously she was cautious of Rio's wounds.</p><p>
<strong> Day 4 </strong>
</p><p>“How were the boys?” Rio asks when Agatha returns home.</p><p>“Good. Lilia gave Tommy to Alice.” She casually informs her.</p><p>“Oh good, she’ll do good with him.” She was secretly worried about who her student would be passed off to. “Oh! Can you see if she’ll take him to the terrain park? He was really excited to try it.” Rio requests, making Agatha soften at her still prioritizing her client that she, in all likelihood, won’t ever see again.</p><p>“Yeah sure. They’re next lesson is on saturday.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Rio hums. There's a comfortable silence between them until Rio remembers she had a request.</p><p>“So I was thinking… maybe we take a little trip to the grocery store tonight?” Rio walks her fingers up Agatha's shoulder. Agatha turns her head, watching the action until Rio pulls her hand back. She shifts her eyes, glaring at Rio in order to get her to continue talking.</p><p>“Please!? I cannot stomach anymore of your frozen junk.” Rio groans dramatically as most of the food in Agatha's home comes from a box in the freezer. “I’ll pay for it and cook it all. I don't care. But one more frozen corn dog and I'll throw myself into a tree again.” She (slowly) throws her head back, gagging along with it.</p><p>“You’ll cook?” Agatha raises her eyebrows.</p><p>“I’ll be your own personal chef.” Rio pulls a wide grin onto her face and bats her eyelashes. Agatha has already made up her mind; But at this point, she always takes a dramatic pause, just to watch Rio squirm.</p><p>“Let's go.” She stands up and walks out of the room. Rio launches up (as fast as her limited mobility will allow her) and trots after Agatha. She looks down at her crop top and shark pj pants and shrugs. She could care less what she’s wearing, she just needs to get out of this house.</p><p>At the store, Agatha picks up a hand basket before Rio gets the chance to grab an entire cart.</p><p>“Don’t go too crazy, I don’t want rotting produce in my fridge after you leave.”</p><p>“Bold of you to assume I’m gonna leave.”</p><p>Agatha playfully scoffs, choosing not to reply. She follows Rio through the store, only chiming in to tell the woman what she will absolutely not eat.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“C’mon I’m great at making scallops.”</p><p>“I’m not eating sea dick. Pick something else.”</p><p>With a huff Rio puts the time back. “They come out of a shell.” She informs her.</p><p>“Whatever, sea pussy. I’m not eating it.”</p><p>Rio laughs back at the woman, missing the smile that breaks onto her face before she schools it back to her usual scowl. They finish their trip with three bags full of groceries and a happy Rio.</p><p>“You can actually cook all of this?” Agatha asks as they unload the groceries when they get home.</p><p>“Your taste buds aren’t gonna know what hit ‘em” Rio says proudly to which Agatha just smiles back in disbelief.</p><p>
<strong> Day 8 </strong>
</p><p>By the end of the week, the two of them have gotten into some semblance of a routine. Agatha is always the first to wake up after discovering that Rio is quite the night owl. By the time she’s about to leave for the day, Rio is usually awake, or waking up. She goes and gets her ice and returns to the room to find Rio slowly willing herself to sit up. When she returns home after work, Rio already has a meal hot and ready to eat.</p><p>“Check it!” Rio calls the second she hears the front door.</p><p>“Oh no, what did you make today?” Agatha pretends to groan although Rio has indeed met expectations. Her food is quite delicious.</p><p>“Honey garlic salmon.” Rio proudly holds out a fork so Agatha can try it. Agatha leans forward, taking the fork into her mouth, not missing the way Rio gulps. She returns an approving hum and a nod which Rio can’t help but feel proud to have caused.</p><p>Every night they have dinner together. Agatha spends the time telling Rio about her day, mostly detailed stories of each time one of her kids wiped out. Then they sit down and work on a puzzle together, much to Rio’s chagrin. Agatha made it a requirement before allowing Rio to fry her brain in front of the TV. Then they head to bed. At this point Rio is able to move around a little easier. She could easily take herself back to the guest room but since that day she laid claim to Agatha's bed, they haven’t discussed it. Agatha dozes off while Rio stays up and reads one of the books Agatha brought her. It’s all disgustingly domestic.</p><p>“How are you feeling?” Agatha asks when she begins to ice Rio’s ribs, finally without any resistance.</p><p>“Way better.” She nearly moans. “I could do a backbend!”</p><p>“No.” Agatha doesn't even entertain the joke. Rio simply smiles to herself then watches as Agatha shifts the ice pack up. The top of her hand grazes the underside of her breast, making her breath silently hitch. Agatha notices the change but doesn't pull away, she simply continues on, just barely grazing the skin. Rio now has her jaw clenched, taking deep calculated breaths like Agatha is an animal that will run off if she sees her.</p><p>Agatha has become basically a professional at wrapping Rio. It never takes more than two minutes. Except for right now. With her hand so delicately pressing against her skin and the other, carefully wrapping the tape, also just barely grazing over her back. She swears she can feel Rio shiver from the touch.</p><p>“We only have to ice for one more day.” Agatha awkwardly reminds her, finally meeting the other woman's eyes.</p><p>Rio lets out an unintentionally disappointed. “Oh.”</p><p>Agatha finishes wrapping her but she keeps her hands where they are, still just barely touching her breast. They keep their eyes locked on one another when Rio reaches down, taking hold of Agatha's wrist. The woman expects Rio to push it away but instead she finds her pulling it up, slowly dragging her fingers over the mound, forcing her to rest it there.</p><p>Rio intends to ease into the moment, to read every micro expression on Agatha's face but Agatha has an entirely different plan as she suddenly surges forward, crashing their lips together. Rio lets out a surprised squeak, quickly melting into the moment, tangling her fingers into Agatha's gorgeous thick hair.</p><p>Agatha coaxes her tongue into Rio's mouth, reveling in the moan that escapes her. She’s going to need that sound permanently etched into her eardrums. The moment is cut short when Rio suddenly winces and Agatha jerks away.</p><p>“Fuck! Sorry.”</p><p>“No no.” Rio waves her hands around, placing one on Agatha's neck as she pulls her back down, whispering against her lips. “It’s worth it.” She hums, connecting their lips once again.</p>

<strong> Day 10 </strong>
</p><p>When Agatha arrives home from work, the house is quiet aside from the rumbling of what she can only assume is her bedroom TV.</p><p>Sure enough, when she enters the room, Rio is glued to the screen.</p><p>“You still have two days of no screens.” Agatha says, crossing her arms.</p><p>“It’s fine.” Rio pushes the air away before looking up at the woman, pulling a knowing grin onto her face.  “I’ve been thinking about you.”</p><p>Agatha smirks and uncrosses her arms. “Me too.” She begins to saunter her way over to the bed. She leans down to capture Rios lips in a hungry kiss. Without any effort, she drags Rio up just by her touch, the younger woman basically levitating.</p><p>Agatha pulls away, panting. “God, I need you to heal faster so I can fuck you.”</p><p>“You can still fuck me like this.” Rio offers, grinning. “I’ll be fine.”</p><p>Agatha tsks, shaking her head, reaching out, forcing Rio to tilt her head up. “You’re gonna want to be completely healed for what I’m gonna do to you.” She whispers, pulling a low groan out of the woman. Agatha hits her with another kiss, sinking her tongue into her mouth. Both of them have quickly discovered that if Agatha's tongue is involved, Rio is very vocal. Agatha pulls herself onto the bed so she’s now straddling the woman. Rio firmly plants her hands onto Agatha's thighs, squeezing them to coax her closer.</p><p>“C’mon just fuck me already. I’ll be fine. You won’t hurt me.” Rio has been non stop trying to get Agatha to fuck her like she’s her husband returning home from war.</p><p>“I have a better idea.” Agatha hums, crawling back off of the woman. Rio props herself up on her elbows, simply observing as Agatha pulls her plan together.</p><p>“C’mon.” She holds a hand out, curling her fingers to beckon Rio forward. Rio rises from the bed, taking Agatha's hand as she drags her into the bathroom.</p><p>Without any words, Agatha moves so she’s standing behind Rio and takes the hem of her shirt, slowly and carefully lifting it over her head. Once her skin is revealed, she begins to place delicate kisses to her shoulders and whispers, “You smell.”</p><p>Rio lets out an offended laugh. “I do not!”</p><p>“Mhm.” Agatha mumbles through her kisses. “You need a shower.” She continues to whisper.</p><p>“You’re such an asshole.” Rio grumbles.</p><p>Agatha chuckles into her shoulder. “Not always.” She turns so she’s now standing in front of Rio, pulling her into a filthy kiss.</p><p>Rio can’t help the moan that ripples through her throat. She melts into Agatha's touch as the woman slowly guides them back towards the shower. Keeping their lips connected, she reaches behind Rio and turns the water on, hoping it will be the right temperature by the time they get in.</p><p>Agatha runs her hands down to Rio's shorts and slowly coaxes them down. Once she’s completely naked, Agatha leans back for a moment to fully appreciate the art infront of her. She then leans in again and runs her hands down Rio's body, appreciating every dip and curve, careful when sliding them across her abdomen.</p><p>“You’re so fucking sexy.” She whispers into her neck, grabbing a handful of ass in the process, making Rio jump. Rio now takes the opportunity to pull Agatha into a heavy opened mouth kiss.</p><p>Steam quickly fills the room, the loud patter of water hitting the tiles muting every sound that leaves their throats. Agatha pulls back, suppressing a smile when Rio blindly chases after her lips. She steps back and easily shucks her own clothes off. She frantically returns her hands to Rio's body and drags her under the running water. Exactly the temperature she was aiming for.</p><p>“How is fucking me in here any better than a bed?” Rio questions.</p><p>Agatha shakes her head. “I never said anything about fucking you.” She makes a dramatic display as she reaches up past Rio's head to grab the shampoo, leaving their faces impossibly close. “I did say you stink.” She smirks.</p><p>“I don’t.” Rio knows she’s kidding but she still feels the need to clarify. “I shower while you’re at work.”</p><p>“Oh okay.” She pauses, putting a hand on Rio's shoulder to slowly turn her around. She leans in and whispers. “I do love the way you smell.” She takes in a deep breath, nipping at her ear. Rio hears the squelch of shampoo being squeezed out of the bottle. “Agatha.” Rio whines as that is a clear sign that this is indeed not going where she wants it to.</p><p>“Shhh. Let me take care of you.” Agatha hums as she begins to work her fingers into Rio's hair. Rio melts into her touch, letting a pathetic moan escape her lips. Her fingers massage her scalp and run through her hair. She thinks she could finish just from this.</p><p>“So pretty.” Agatha hums and Rio moans again.</p><p>“Agatha please, fuck me, I don’t care if you break my ribs.” Her voice is helpless and needy. She can feel Agatha smirk against her skin and then suddenly a hand is snaking around her neck, slightly pulling her back so their body’s are flush against one another.</p><p>“I said you have to wait.” Agatha hisses, applying enough pressure that Rio has to gasp for a moment. She likes it, that much is obvious, it’s not like she’s been subtle about what Agatha does to her. “Just be a good girl and you’ll get what you want soon enough.” Agatha says as she curls her fingers so her nails leave a light indent on Rio's throat.</p><p>She pulls Rio back under the water to rinse out the shampoo before turning her back around so they’re face to face again. She loves how easily Rio bends to her will. In front of people, she’s a mouthy pest but behind closed doors, she’s wrapped around Agatha’s finger.</p><p>Agatha reaches up to cup Rio’s cheek and wipe the water off of her face. They don’t exchange any words for once. Agatha simply stares back at the woman, watching every slight flicker in her face as she gazes back. When she pulls her hands back, Rio follows for a second before forcing herself to stand up straight. She squeezes body wash into her hands and tries not to laugh at the way Rio is eagerly waiting for her to continue.</p><p>She lathers the soap between her fingers, deftly starting with her arms. She takes a second too long working on her arms so Rio takes her by the wrist and forces her hands over to her tits.</p><p>Agatha snaps her head up so their eyes lock again. “I said let me take care of you.” She reminds the woman, yanking her arm out of Rio’s grasp. She then chooses to sink down to her knees and get to work on her legs.</p><p>Rio looks down at her, eyes lidded and mouth slightly open while she watches the woman below her. Agatha takes both hands and slowly works her way up one leg, taking extra care on her thigh. Another moan, this time from Agatha.</p><p>“Please.” It’s so pathetic that Agatha can barely hear her. She chooses not to respond and instead moves on to the next leg, allowing her fingers to slide even closer to her opening. Rio is barely able to resist the feral urge to take her wrist again and force the woman inside her.</p><p>“Such a good girl.” Agatha praises, she knows Rio is in a battle right now and it is wildly hot. She rises back to her feet, clamping her hands onto Rio's hips and pressing their cores together. Rio of course, whines at the contact. Agatha finally kisses her again and Rio clambers to wrap her arms around the woman's neck. She slightly winces as she lifts her arms. She’s past the worst of the healing process but they still hurt.</p><p>“That's why you have to wait.” Agatha mumbles against her lips and Rio huffs back, quickly smashing their mouths back together. She’ll take what she can get.</p><p>
<strong> Day 12 </strong>
</p><p>The pair is lounging in Agatha's living room on Agatha's day off when the woman suddenly speaks. “You need to get out of this house and do something.”</p><p>Rio turns her neck up towards her. “Like what?”</p><p>Agatha taps her chin as she brainstorms. Most everything there is to do requires too much walking for Rio to be comfortable. Agatha shudders, why is so carful and considerate when coming up with what to do? She moves back to a happy medium,  “How bout a Bullsnakes game?”</p><p>That makes Rio shoot straight up at the mention of their home pro basketball team, The Bullsnakes. “What!?” Pure excitement is radiating off of her. Quite the opposite of the reaction she expected.</p><p>“Yeah, I think there's a game tonight.” She pulls out her phone and gets to searching. “That way, you get out of the house, you have to walk but you can also sit down most of the time. You wanna go?”</p><p>“Yes! I fucking love the bullsnakes! It's just such a bitch to go all the way downtown.” She groans. “I think they’re gonna make the playoffs this year!”</p><p>Agatha chuckles at how adorably excited she is. “Well perfect we’re going.”</p><p>Silence fills the air as Rio chooses her next words. “So like… a date?”</p><p>Agatha pauses, pursing her lips as she thinks. “Yeah I guess.” She shrugs casually.</p><p>Rio somehow manages to smile even wider after that.</p><p>“What? Was shoving my tongue down your throat and feeling you up in the shower not enough for you?”</p><p>“I don’t know.” She shrugs. “Maybe you should do it again.” She wriggles her eyebrows.</p><p>Agatha playfully rolls her eyes but gives into the request, leaning over and kissing Rio deeply. Agatha grasps onto Rios thigh and drags her up into her lap. Rio suddenly gasps and pulls away.</p><p>“We’re on a winning streak right now! If we win tonight, we break our record!”</p><p>Agatha furrows her brow. “That’s what you’re thinking about right now?”</p><p>Rio innocently nods, making Agatha playfully roll her eyes back at her.</p><p>“Let's run by my place before we leave. I wanna grab my jersey. I have two! You can wear my Rilke one!” She beams.</p><p>Agatha didn’t expect the idea to go to a game to be such a hit. She just thought it was a good activity for Rio to go to while she’s still recovering. But the woman is absolutely over the moon and it’s the cutest thing ever.</p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha smiles as she confirms the ticket purchase.</p><p>At Rio's apartment, she heads straight to her closet and begins digging around to find the jerseys. Agatha stands behind her as she riffles through the clothes.</p><p>“Okay here is yours.” She tosses Agatha a purple jersey with green trim, sporting the number 27, and the name “Rilke”. She pictures the player. Kinda tall, brown hair, with terrifyingly blue eyes just like hers, she kind of reminds her of a young Agatha.</p><p>“And mine!” Rio holds up her jersey, which is black with green and purple trim and the number 15, “Reid” on it.</p><p>“Quick put it on, let's go! I haven’t been to a game in forever!” Rio pulls her jersey on and snags a matching Bullsnakes hat on her way out of the house. Agatha can’t help but simply admire the woman as she walks away. The jersey hugs her perfectly which allows for her gorgeously toned arms to be seen. She could jump her right now.</p><p>“I didn’t realise you were such a big fan.” Agatha laughs, trailing after her.</p><p>“Oh yeah. We’re totally gonna make the playoffs this year.” Rio says over the car as she waits for Agatha to unlock it.</p><p>The drive downtown from the mountains is sort of long, So Rio and Agatha are stuck with making conversation as their entertainment for the next two hours.</p><p>“Okay, so tell me.” Rio leans on the center console. “How the fuck do you afford your house and last minute bullsnakes tickets?”</p><p>“Oh now you’re interested in knowing more about me?”</p><p>“I’ve always been interested. You’re just the sketchiest person I’ve ever met.” Rio retorts, making Agatha laugh.</p><p>She finishes laughing, half expecting Rio to leave it alone but when she glances at the woman, she is patiently waiting for an answer.</p><p>Agatha huffs. “Fine.” She weighs her next words. She never tells anyone anything about herself. She prefers to allow everyone to make up whatever they want about her, the truth doesn't matter at the end of the day. But Rio… something about her feels like she can trust her, or at least not totally regret letting her in, just a little.</p><p>“Well, my Mother owned a few apartment buildings up here  and when she died, I got them.” She looks at Rio, expecting her to look at her all sad after mentioning her dead mom but she’s just waiting for her to go on. It’s refreshing.  “Yeah so I sold them and I still make twenty percent of what the landlords bring in. I don’t really need to work but it’s something to do, so, whatever.” She quickly finishes her explanation.</p><p>“Hm.”</p><p>“What’s hm?”</p><p>“Just… a little underwhelming.” Rio shrugs, returning to sitting up like normal.</p><p>“Excuse me, what’s underwhelming about my dead rich mother?”</p><p>“Oh c’mon, I wanted you to be like a secret service agent that’s been sent on an undercover mission or like you’re some playboy millionaire hiding after getting caught laundering money, or maybe just a tax evader. Maybe you murdered the previous owner who was a lonely widow and no one’s noticed she’s dead yet!” Rio sporadically lists off her theories.</p><p>Agatha glances between Rio and the road ahead of her. “How old are you?” To Rio the question is out of nowhere but for Agatha, she’s been wanting to ask since the first day they met.</p><p>“Uhh, 28?”</p><p>“Twenty eight!” Agatha yelps. “I’m nearly double your age!”</p><p>“Yeah, it’s fucking hot.”</p><p>“Oh my god.” Agatha drops her head into one hand, forcefully sliding her hand down her face. “Oh my god.”</p><p>“Oh stop it, it’s not that big of a deal.” Rio bats at the air and turns the charm back on. “I love how assertive and daddy you are.” She reaches out and squeezes the women's biceps, watching her cheeks flush with a light pink.</p><p>That internal battle for Agatha lasts all of two seconds and she’s back to fantasizing about the different ways she can fuck Rio once she’s better. Her mind wanders for a second then she feels Rios gaze on her and pulls out a question.</p><p>“So how’d you find yourself as a snowboard instructor?”</p><p>“Well I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Botany but that's not really in high demand in the winter.” She chuckles. “For the rest of the year I work up at Blue Spruce.” She points in the general direction of the national park that’s about an hour away from the witches road.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Mhm.”</p><p>“That explains all the plants.”</p><p>“I gotta scratch the itch somehow.” Rio smiles. Agatha keeps her eyes forward, she’s usually causal with her driving but driving down from the mountains means breaking every two seconds. Her mind still wanders though. She wonders what Rio would look like in her uniform. She has no clue what it might look like, but she knows it’s probably ridiculously cute and inexplicably hot all at once.</p><p>When they get to the arena, Rio is so excited that she is unintentionally forcing herself to walk way faster than her, now only bruised, ribs want her to.</p><p>“Slow down before you crash into someone.” Agatha grabs her arm and yanks the woman back, forcing her to hold her hand.</p><p>Halfway around the ring of the Arena, Agatha pulls Rio over to a concession stand.</p><p>“I need a corn dog.”</p><p>“Do you eat anything that’s not deep fried or frozen?” Rio laughs while they wait.</p><p>“No. I don’t have time, nor do I care to cook.”</p><p>Rio leans in. “Good thing you have a live-in chef now.”</p><p>“Oh do I?”</p><p>“Mhm.” Rio nods.</p><p>“We’ll see.” Agatha says, her tone is light and Rio knows she’s not completely opposed to the idea.</p><p>After Agatha acquires her corn dog and they both get ridiculously expensive drinks, they find the entrance to their section where Agatha leads them down to the center of the lower ring.</p><p>“Not bad.” Rio compliments, although internally, she’s freaking out. All three games she’s been to, she’s been in the nosebleeds.</p><p>Agatha looks around at the sea of fans sporting purple and green with a few clusters of blue and gold. “So who are we playing?”</p><p>“Rams.” Rio answers. “They go down easy. Plus they have Nolen out, we’re totally gonna win.” She confidently sits back in her chair.</p><p>Agatha lets out a small shocked laugh. “Wow you’re a huge fan, you even know about the other teams.”</p><p>“I mean, my plants can only provide so much entertainment.” She responds, chuckling.</p><p>When the game starts, Agatha was planning on half paying attention, and for some reason, she’s surprised when Rio locks in like it’s the finals. She even joins in on the cringy chants, something Agatha definitely didn’t expect.She loudly laughs when Rio and the entire arena hisses like a snake after they score a three.</p><p>“Oh my god.” She is still laughing when they stop.</p><p>“C’mon, it’s fun.” Rio scolds her.</p><p>“Oh yeah it’s something.” Agatha snickers.</p><p>Just then Agatha's jersey, Rilke, runs ahead and dunks, sending the crowd into a frenzy. The man behind Agatha grabs her shoulder and begins violently shaking her, probably taking her jersey as a sign that she would be excited. He was mistaken and Agatha quickly slaps his hand away, sending him a menacing glare. Rio turns to see if Agatha saw the play and misses the moment by a split second.</p><p>“That was your jersey!” She reminds her and Agatha nods. She is well aware.</p><p>Rio adds on, “God she’s so fucking hot.” Agatha looks at the woman jogging down the court as she receives congratulatory pats from her teammates. Yup, that’s exactly what she looked like in her late twenties. Rio definitely has a type.</p><p>The Rams, on their possession, go on to score a three. Then when the Bullsnakes have the ball again, it’s number 3 who is driving it to the hole when suddenly another player comes in and yanks the Bullsnakes star player by her jersey right as she’s going for a layup.</p><p>“What the fuck! Call that!?” Rio screams, launching up.</p><p>Agatha can’t help but chuckle at how passionate the sport makes Rio.</p><p>“What the fuck!” She yells when the other team gets the ball and scores after what was obviously a foul. Rio joins in on the arena chanting “Ref you suck!” followed by a grunt of pain as she sits back down.</p><p>“Maybe this wasn’t a great idea.” Agatha chuckles at her as she has taken every opportunity to shoot up out of her seat no matter how painful.</p><p>“No no this is great.” Rio is back to absolutely beaming as another play starts. Agatha smiles back at her, biting back how wide the grin actually is.</p><p>The games goes on, Agatha can recall maybe two things that happened but everytime the game gets her attention, Rio does something that reels her back in and she spends way too long admiring the woman. The way she smiles, her deep brown eyes and something about her in a basketball jersey is extra hot. When they usually see each other, they’re covered head to toe in their ski gear. A tanktop is a welcomed change.</p><p>When the game ends, the Bullsnakes win, 121-106, an easy sweep.</p><p>“Can we make some noise for our very own, Reid, breaking the Bullsnakes all time record for most shots blocked!” The announcer's voice booms and Rio lights up, pinching the chest of her jersey and shaking it around so everyone can see what number she has on.</p><p>Leaving the arena is of course hell. Everyone is slowly shuffling their way out, shoulder to shoulder, but that doesn't stop Rio from clasping Agatha's hand as she drags her through the crowd. Neither of them care to say excuse me as they rudely shove their way through people. Agatha smiles at Rio firmling gripping her hand behind her back.</p><p>They emerge from the crowd and out into the cold evening air.</p><p>“We gotta move it or we won’t be home until like 2.” Rio picks up her pace but still refuses to release Agatha's hand. Agatha speeds up so they’re finally next to each other again.</p><p>“I thought this was my date.” She teases as Rio has suddenly put on the pants.</p><p>“It is.” She smiles and leans her head on Agatha's shoulder, sliding her arm into Agathas, pulling her closer. “It was perfect.”</p>

<p>At the end of the two weeks, Rio finally willed herself to go home (for one night) then she was back at Agatha's place as much as possible.</p><p>“Look what I made!” Rio yells the second Agatha gets home to find her at the dining room table. The woman holds up senior scratchy who is wearing a tiny helmet and goggles that Rio made out of cardboard.</p><p>“Oh my god.” Agatha can’t help but coo at the sight.</p><p>“Oh and I'm working on his board!” Rio holds up the beginnings of a tiny snowboard.</p><p>Agatha takes the cardboard out of her hand. “You are not allowed to corrupt my bunny.”</p><p>“Well you can’t stop me when you’re not here.” She shrugs, snatching her work back.</p><p>Agatha moves so she’s standing behind Rio, wrapping her arms around her neck and resting her head next to hers.</p><p>“So this is where your boredom has taken you?” She chuckles.</p><p>“Psh yeah. I might end up making him his own mountain.” Rio laughs back. “But you know another way to kill time?” She tilts her head back so her eyes meet Agathas while she clamps a hand onto her thigh.</p><p>“Hm?” She hums, ghosting their lips together. Rio cranes her neck up, capturing Agatha is a sensual kiss. The awkward position goes unnoticed as Rio bites down on Agatha's bottom lip, followed by her tongue rolling over the mark to soothe the pain. She whispers between breaths. “You take me to that bedroom of yours and show me what you’ve been dying to do to me.” She swears she can hear a low groan in Agatha's throat before the woman slowly pulls back.</p><p>“You’re cute.” She pats her cheek and walks away. “Two more weeks.” She says, surprised when Rio is suddenly whipping her back around, yanking her into another kiss. Agatha reluctantly pulls away. “Two more weeks then I’ll give you everything you want.”</p><p>Rio groans. “Ughhhhhh.” Agatha simply laughs at her. Rio sulks for a little while longer before moving on. “So have you told anyone?”</p><p>“What? That your two week stay has turned into a month and you can’t seem to keep your hands to yourself?”</p><p>Rio laughs and nods.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“So you want to keep it a secret?” Rio’s voice slightly falters.</p><p>“Not a secret.” Agatha shakes her head, placing her hands on Rio’s waist, pulling her in. “They’ll find out when they find out. I don’t need them thinking they’re important enough to get a relationship update. Besides,” She leans in closer, brushing her lips just under Rio’s ear. “I like having you all to myself.” She begins placing breathy kisses to her neck.</p><p>Rio melts into the advance, letting a soft moan escape her lips. “Once I'm back on the mountain, I’m still gonna bully you.”</p><p>Agatha hums. “Okay.” Then yanks Rio so their body’s are flush together, causing her to gasp. “If you wanna be a brat…” She draws a finger along her jaw, coaxing a digit into her mouth with a moan. “Then you have to be ready for the consequences.” She pulls her finger back while Rio tries to follow it, a needy look in her eyes.</p><p>“Now go take that dumb helmet off of my bunny.” She commands the woman who turns to follow instructions while Agatha takes the opportunity to playfully slap her ass as she walks away, snickering at her yelp.</p><p>
<strong> Week 6 Day 7 </strong>
</p><p>It’s six A.M. and Rio is rustling around the house as quietly as she can without waking Agatha. She’s finally completely healed. They still have to go and get her checked out and cleared but as far as she can tell, she’s completely fine.</p><p>So in celebration, she’s gathering all of her gear and getting ready to hit the slopes for the last day of the season. Rio’s outfit of choice when she’s not working is a big black hoodie, plastered in tiny floral print, and her baggy dark green snow pants.</p><p>Once she’s fully dressed, she tucks her gloves into her helmet and goes to sit on the couch to wait for Agatha. Just ten minutes later, Agatha appears in the living room where Rio launches up from the couch.</p><p>“You ready!?” She beams</p><p>“What?” Agatha yelps when she processes Rio fully dressed in her gear. “No.” She begins waving her hands around.</p><p>“Why not? It’s exactly six weeks today! I gotta get back out there!” She mimics snowboarding.</p><p>“No. It's the last day of the season.”</p><p>“Exactly! I always do the pond skim!” Rio yelps.</p><p>The pond skim is a skiing tradition that most resorts participate in. On the last day of the season, they dig a hole into the snow, line it with plastic, and fill it up like a pool. There's a long steep run leading to a jump, then anyone who wants to, can try and see if they can skim all the way across and stick it on the other side. Some people wear costumes and most everyone fails and hits the water, hard.</p><p>“Well not this year.” Agatha shakes her head, reaching out to pull Rios helmet off of her. Rio groans but allows it.</p><p>“C’mon.” Rio whines, bending her knees so she has to look straight up at the woman, putting those big brown eyes to use. “It’s the last day of the season.” She pouts.</p><p>“Mhm. And you’ll be back at it in November.” Agatha condescendingly pats the top of her head which Rio follows with a grumble.</p><p>“We’ll go and watch though. Just let me get ready.” And with that, Agatha walks off, leaving a grumpy Rio behind. Rio thinks to herself, luckily her board is still in her locker at work. “I’m still wearing my boots!” She yells after the woman who just waves a dismissive hand over her shoulder.</p><p>When they get to the resort, there are twice as many people as usual. A beautiful spring day usually brings out a crowd but the final day of the season and its festivities makes for an extra busy day.</p><p>“Closing day and I can’t compete.” Rio grumbles as they walk through the bustling town.</p><p>“You are guaranteed to fall. No shit I'm not letting you do it.”</p><p>Rio scoffs. “It’s just water.”</p><p>Agatha simply rolls her eyes, unless Rio throws herself into the pool, she won.</p><p>“Oh look who’s alive.” Jen comments when she sees the pair approach her.</p><p>“Barely.” Rio smiles. “Where’s Alice?”</p><p>“You got here just in time, she’s about to go down.” They all look up to the top of the hill where Alice is third in line to take her turn. One guy on skis, dressed as a power ranger, takes off. He gains enough speed that he clears the jump and miraculously manages to make it all the way across without falling.</p><p>“See! That should be me!” Rio yelps.</p><p>Jen steps in. “You’ve literally never cleared it.” She laughs and Rio sticks her tongue back out at the woman.</p><p>“Well today I could but this dick won’t let me.” Rio jabs an accusatory thumb towards Agatha.</p><p>“Fine, break your ribs. I’m not helping you again.” She dramatically gestures for her to go ahead which Rio just huffs at.</p><p>The next girl heads down the run and sticks the landing but she doesn't have enough speed and sinks into the water.</p><p>“Here’s Alice.” Jen points. Alice is rocking the most vibrant red outfit she could scrounge up. Bright red pants, bright red jacket, and a homemade red mohawk beanie.</p><p>“C’mon Alice!” Rio screams as Alice comes barreling down the run. She hits the water, skidding about halfway until she leans too far forward and hits the water with a large splash.</p><p>The crowd groans “Ooooh” while the attendants toss her a rope and drag her out of the water.</p><p>Alice jogs over to her friends, laughing as she pulls off her drenched hat. “You gonna do it Jen?”</p><p>“Now why on earth would I want to completely soak all of my gear and publicly humiliate myself?”</p><p>Agatha shrugs, that's a pretty good reason not to do it.</p><p>Alice then engulfs Rio in a sopping wet hug. “How are you feeling!?” She yelps, a bright grin on her face.</p><p>“Should be good as new. Just gotta get checked one more time.” She answers, patting her abdomen.</p><p>“So you’re not doing it this year?” Alice frowns.</p><p>Agatha jumps in. “At the risk of resetting all my hard work? No.”</p><p>“Rio!” Lilia calls when she spots the woman. “Six weeks! There better be a good report.” She yells as she nears them.</p><p>“Should be good to go.” Rio salutes.</p><p>Lila glares at her knowingly. “You’re not doing the pond skim are you?”</p><p>She shakes her head. “Unfortunately, no.” Every single person individually asking only adds to her fomo.</p><p>“Good.” Lilia nods.</p><p>“Well I have a surprise that I think you’ll approve of.” Alice points behind Rio so she turns around to see the twins approaching them.</p><p>“Tom!” Rio calls, throwing her arms up as the kid jogs to give her a gentle hug.</p><p>“You’re better!” He beams.</p><p>“I am.” Rio smiles.</p><p>Alice urges the boy to go on.</p><p>“Oh yeah!” He clears his throat. ”I’m gonna do the pond skim!”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widen with joy. “Fuck yeah you are!” She gives him a hard high-five. “C’mon let's go!” Rio waves for him to follow her to the top.</p><p>“What about you?” Agatha nudges Billy who immediately shakes his head, taking a step back for good measure.</p><p>“I’m good.” He lets out an awkward laugh.</p><p>The group all patiently wait while a few other people go before Tommy’s turn.</p><p>Rio takes Tommy by the shoulders and turns him to face her.<br/>
“I don’t care If you land this or not but if I see one turn I swear to god.”</p><p>“Oh now you don’t want me to turn?”</p><p>Rio chuckles. “Just send it kid.” She pats his back.</p><p>Tommy shuffles his way over to the edge, looking down to the pool before he confidently takes off. He follows instructions and straight lines the whole way down. He hits the jump so hard that he clears half of the pool and hits the water with the largest splash possible.</p><p>“Fuck yeah Tom!” Rio screams before turning to run back down to the group.</p><p>The soaking wet teen makes his way back over to everyone. “Holy shit.” He yelps, shaking himself out like a dog. “Why is it so cold!?”</p><p>“You basically just jumped into an ice bath.” Agatha points out the obvious reason.</p><p>“Ya gonna do it Bill?” He asks his brother who once again dramatically takes a step back.</p><p>He holds his hands up. “No way.”</p><p>“Killed it!” Rio yells, holding up a high-five for her student. She turns towards Alice. “Thanks for not ruining him.”</p><p>“You pretty much did all the work. All I had to do was some fine tuning.”</p><p>“Oh so you all talk about your students like we’re machines and you’re writing a program.” Billy says, looking between the women.</p><p>“Well yeah.” Agatha scoffs. “You’re just annual pet projects.” She condescendingly pats the boy's head. Billy just grimaces back at her.</p><p>“Rio, you have to see Tommy at the terrain park.” Alice adds on.</p><p>“Yeah! I can hit the jumps and I almost have the rail down!” He excitedly tells her. Rio looks at Agatha with a mischievous glint in her eyes before turning back to the boy.</p><p>“Let me get my board.” She says, flashing a grin at Agatha before running off in the direction of the ski school.</p><p>Agatha lets her go. If she chases after her and drags her back without a board, there will be a lot of questions that she does not care to answer right now. She instead waits a few moments before excusing herself. Agatha situates herself around the corner where she waits until she see’s Rio confidently walking with her board in hand. She reaches out and pulls the woman to the side.</p><p>“If you do it I swear to god Rio.” She grits through her teeth.</p><p>“Relax baby, I’m just gonna cruise down the terrain park so I can watch Tom.” She says casually. Agatha gives her a knowing look.</p><p>“You better.” She says, yanking Rio closer so she can whisper. “Because if you go down the pond skim, that is the only way you’re getting wet.” She threatens, making Rio laugh and shudder all at once.</p><p>“You got it boss.” She salutes her back and continues on. Agatha follows close behind her when she notices Rio doesn't have a helmet. She pulls off her own to set on Rio’s head.</p><p>“There.” She pats it for good measure, laughing when Rio jumps in surprise at the contact. “Now you really won’t die.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Rio hums, taking Agatha by the collar and pulling her in for a quick kiss. They separate just as they round the corner where the group is waiting.</p><p>“Ready Tom!?” Rio yells, waving for him to follow her to the lift.</p><p>Jen looks at Rio suspiciously then back at Agatha. “Why is Rio wearing your helmet?”</p><p>“Well her brain doesn't need any more damage now does it?” Agatha sneers, hoping there won’t be any more questions to follow.</p><p>“You also showed up at the same time.” Jen is now peering at her, clearly suspicious.</p><p>“Convenient, right?.” Agatha shrugs.</p><p>“Okaaaaaay.” Jen drawls out, receiving a threatening glare from Agatha.</p><p>Thirty minutes later, Rio and Tommy are back at the bottom of the mountain.</p><p>“Agatha! He’s so good!” Rio yells to her girlfriend the second she’s in ear shot. “We’re gonna hit it again!” She calls as they both skate their way back into line.</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha calls after her but the woman has already disappeared back into the crowd.</p><p>Agatha chooses to spend her time waiting for Rio, watching person after person eat shit on the pond skim. After an hour passed, Billy and Alice both went off to do their own thing, leaving Agatha and Jen to start making bets on people. Five dollars per person when they disagree on if they’ll land it or not.</p><p>“Look it’s Jesus!” Agatha yells and points to the man dressed at Jesus, holding his board over his shoulders like a cross for extra effect.</p><p>“Oh he’ll stick it.” Jen nods.</p><p>“You think?”</p><p>“The guy is supposed to walk on water. It would be embarrassing if he didn’t make it.” Jen points out.</p><p>“Tread lightly Jenny,” Agatha mocks. “You’re already thirty bucks deep.”</p><p>Jen simply scoffs back at her.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Jesus is gearing up to take his turn. The crowd cheers louder than they have for anyone else. He hits the jump at just the right speed and skids almost to the end but just as he gets to the end, he hits the water.</p><p>“So close!” Jen groans in disappointment while Agatha maniacally laughs next to her. Jen joins in on her laughter, waiting until she calms down to speak again.</p><p>“So now that you’re in a good mood.” She wearily pauses. “Are you ready to admit that you and Rio are a thing?”</p><p>Agatha chokes, snapping her head to look at Jen like she’s insane.</p><p>“Don’t give me that. You two have been bickering since the day you met and then you come back from two weeks of being stuck together and all of a sudden, that rivalry is gone and you’re making her wear your helmet? Please.” She scoffs.</p><p>Agatha doesn't say a word, she simply glares back at Jen. Maybe she’ll give up if she stays silent for long enough.</p><p>“Great. That’s all the confirmation I need.” She sneers back to the woman who huffs in response.</p><p>“Just shut up and mind your business Jennifer.”</p><p>“Okay.” The woman says, unbothered by Agatha's “Threat”</p><p>Another hour later, Rio and Tommy are laughing together as they walk back up to Jen and Agatha.</p><p>“Guess who cleared a whole rail!” Rio yells while Tommy triumphantly cheers next to her.</p><p>“Nice.” Agatha plainly complements the boy.</p><p>Tommy pulls out his phone, jumping to turn the other direction when he reads the message.</p><p>“Oh my family is at the other base waiting for me.” He looks to Rio. “I’m glad you’re okay. Thanks for being a dope teacher.” he sends her a sweet smile.</p><p>“Yeah no problem kid.” Rio playfully pushes him.</p><p>Tommy then looks at Agatha. “Billy says the same too. He didn’t want to tell you to your face because he thought you might make him do a double black.” He laughs. “But he’s really glad he had you.”</p><p>Agatha lets a very small smile onto her face. She can’t let anyone know she’s actually fond of the kid. “Tell him I expect to see him at the x games next year.” She jokes and Tommy sends back a salute before giving Rio a quick hug and taking off.</p><p>“Good kids.” Rio smiles.</p><p>“Too sweet.” Agatha brushes it off, trying her best to keep down her thoughts of how good Rio was with Tommy and all the memories of her being absolutely adorable when she has the littles. They’re already domestic enough as it is.</p><p>“Alright, let's go, I'm not dealing with this traffic hell waiting to happen.” She points to the large number of people still all around them.</p><p>“See ya!” Jen waves to the pair, sending them a knowing look that Agatha responds to by sticking her tongue out.</p><p>When they get to the car, Rio dramatically slumps down in the passenger seat, groaning loudly.</p><p>“What’s wrong princess.” Agatha mocks her.</p><p>“No more snowboarding for six months.” She whines.</p><p>“Oh how will you survive?” Agatha jokingly coos, cupping the woman's cheek. Rio seizes the opportunity, quickly leaning over the console to place a languid kiss to Agatha's lips.</p><p>She backs up, their lips making a soft sound as they part. “I can think of a few ways to spend the time.” She charmingly smiles back at the woman, whose eyes are completely shot as she gazes back at her. “I’m all healed now.”</p><p>Agatha refrains from saying anything back, instead focusing on leaving the parking lot. But she is definitely thinking about it.</p><p>At Agatha's house, the pair is peacefully winding down for the evening when Agatha takes notice of Rio’s short shorts. She watches her for a second as she does her normal night time routine. Or more accurately, stares at the hint of her ass peeking out while she’s distracted with brushing her teeth. Agatha waits until she’s done before she carries herself over to the woman, sighing deeply as she wraps her arms around her waist.</p><p>“You’re right.” Agatha suddenly says, gaining a confused look from Rio. “You are pretty much healed.” She painfully slowly drags her hands up her body. “I think you deserve a little reward.” She reaches up, curling her fingers around Rio's jaw, pulling her back into a filthy kiss.</p><p>Rio yelps at the contact, quickly melting into the embrace, turning so she can wrap her arms around the woman's neck.</p><p>Agatha pulls away, reveling in the whimper that leaves Rio's lips. She still has a firm grip on her jaw, forcing her to look up at her. “You’ve been such a good girl Rio.” Her voice comes out naturally seductive but when she puts it on intentionally, Rio could probably finish from her words alone. “I know how badly you wanted to do the pond skim.” She speaks with her lips right against Rios.</p><p>“Mhm.” Rio whimpers into her mouth. “God, just fuck me already.” The words are completely out of her control. Agatha wickedly smirks and takes Rio's hand, dragging her back out of the bathroom, towards her bed.</p><p>Agatha pushes Rio until her legs hit the edge of the bed and she leans in, capturing Rio's lips in hers. The kiss starts slow until Agatha instinctively runs her tongue along Rios lower lip, causing her to part her lips. Rio lets out a small moan that lights a fire in Agatha. Her hands start on Rio’s hips and slowly adjusts them so the tips of her fingers are resting on the bottom of her shirt.</p><p>“This is in my way.” She whispers against her lips, slowly lifting the hem of her shirt.<br/>
“Mhm.” Rio hums, holding up her arms so it will be easier to remove. Agatha pulls the shirt up and over her head, slowly revealing her upper half.<br/>
“You too.” Rio whispers. Agatha nods her head and slowly removes her own shirt. Rio watches as her skin is revealed. She impulsively sends her hands forward, holding her waist in place until her shirt is completely removed and Agathas looking at her through heavy lashes. Agatha pulls a soft smirk onto her face, seeing the need and admiration in Rio's eyes as she slowly begins to work her hands upwards. A soft groan falls from Agatha's lips when Rio's hand gently cups her breast. She reaches behind Agatha's back to unclasp the back of her bra. Rio tosses the thing to the side, staring at her boobs the second they’re revealed. Her hand cups one while her mouth finds its way to her other nipple, gently nipping at it then running her tongue over the sensitive skin. Agatha gasps and leans forward into her touch. “Rio…” Her voice is a plea and before Rio knows it, she feels her own bra being removed.<br/>
Agatha gently places a hand on Rio’s stomach, slowly pressing down until she's lying on her back. She captures her lips in a passionate kiss, smiling to herself when Rio chases after her mouth as she pulls away and moves down to her jaw. She gently nips at her neck, slowly working her way over every inch of her skin. For a second, she can feel Rios quickening pulse and she makes sure to place a tender kiss in the exact spot she felt it.<br/>
Agatha slowly slides her hand back down Rios torso, stopping on her stomach, her palm resting just above the waistband of her underwear. “You’re so beautiful.” Agatha whispers into her ear. A pleading groan escapes from Rio's lungs, urging Agatha to continue. Agatha takes the waist of her shorts and slowly pulls them down as she peppers Rio's neck with gentle kisses, shying away from the previous bites. Once the shorts are off and long forgotten on the bedroom floor, she returns her hand. This time it's lower so her palm is resting over the fabric of her underwear and her fingers are curled into the elastic band.<br/>
“I’m so glad you feel better.” Agatha nips at her ear. “Too bad you’ll be sore tomorrow.” She has to stop herself from laughing at Rio loudly moaning at the idea.<br/>
Agatha instead takes that as an opportunity to tease her further, pressing her palm down so there's a little pressure to alleviate the throbbing she's sure she’s experiencing. “Please, just fuck me Agatha.” She whines, raising her hips so Agatha’s hand is forced closer to her. Agatha smirks down at her before pulling her underwear down the rest of the way. She runs her fingers over her opening, letting the slick coat her fingers, watching Rio’s lips part slightly on contact.<br/>
“Agatha please.” She whines again and that's all it takes to slide a finger inside. Rio gasps, immediately arching her back. Agatha didn’t expect Rio to be so needy. Every small movement causes a weak moan to fall from Rio’s lips.<br/>
When Agatha slips in another finger, Rio reaches up, clawing at her back, running her fingernails down her sides. They’re long enough to leave marks in Agatha’s skin where she clenches her fingers.<br/>
Agatha lets out a hot breath against Rio's neck, teasing her clit. Rio shuts her eyes tighter, squirming under the woman. She clenches her hands, digging her nails further into Agatha’s back. Agatha winces in pain and forces her fingers deeper into Rio without even thinking. Rio lightly grinds into her hand.<br/>
“No.” Agatha takes her spare hand, pushing Rio’s hips back down. “Let me.” Her voice is low and demanding and Rio can’t help but follow her command. “Good girl.” She whispers and Rio moans again.<br/>
Agatha begins to curl her fingers faster, watching Rio twist uncontrollably, groaning and whining as she reaches her climax. She lets out one last moan, crumbling underneath Agatha as her fingers slow and she tentatively pulls them out. Agatha leans down and places a long kiss to her lips. Rio reluctantly pulls away. She has nothing to say, she simply heaves as she tries to catch her breath. But before she knows it, Agatha is forcefully flipping her over. She lands on her stomach with a grunt. Agatha places a firm hand on the small of her back.<br/>
“You just stay right there gorgeous.”<br/>
Rio whines at the loss of contact as she feels the weight shift when Agatha gets up from the bed. She hears a familiar sound and turns around to confirm her suspicions. There Agatha is, securing a bright purple dildo into her strap.<br/>
Rio can’t help but gasp “Fuck.” which causes Agatha to snap her head up, Blue and green eyes locking onto her brown ones. Agatha keeps her mouth shut though, she saunters her way back over to the bed, crawling back up, straddling Rio’s bent legs.<br/>
She takes Rio by the hips, pulling her back so her ass in the air, solidifying the change in positions with a hard slap. She then leans over the woman so her font is flush with her back, dragging one hand up to clasp around her throat.</p><p>“You’re so pretty.”</p><p>Rio moans again. “Agatha.” It comes out unwillingly pathetic.</p><p>Agatha squeezes her fingers around her neck while her other hand makes the same advancement on her ass, driving yet another pathetic moan from Rio. “Shh baby, just relax.” Her voice is low and breathy. Rio feels the silicone lightly brushing around her entrance. She tries to lean back on it to urge it close but Agatha firms her grip on her hips, holding her just far enough away.</p><p>Her voice is stern and commanding again. “I said relax.”</p><p>Relax is the last thing Rio wants to do. If she had it her way, Agatha would be on her back right now and Rio would be riding her like she’s trying to break her ribs again. But she’s at Agatha's mercy right now and it is absolutely intoxicating. She complies by letting her face fall into the mattress.</p><p>“So good.” Agatha coos, taking a hold of the toy, finally lining it up with Rio’s entrance. She slowly begins to sink into Rio, letting out her own moan as the strap pushes against her clit.</p><p>Rio groans. “Fuuuuck!”</p><p>Agatha smirks, pulling out slightly before sinking further into the woman. With each slow thrust Rio’s body slides further down until Agatha pulls her back up to keep the angle. Agatha leans back down so she can speak directly into her ear, with one hand still wrapped around her neck.</p><p>“Y’know Rio, this is all I've been able to think about.” She hums. “Every day when I come home and this pretty little thing is just here waiting for me,” Rio whimpers as Agatha slams her hips into hers. “I’ve been imagining for weeks what you would look like, bent over… with my cock inside of you.”</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha.” There's not much else Rio can say, she’s so overwhelmed by the woman slamming into her, her fingers clawing at her skin and her breath in her ear.</p><p>“You take me so well Rio.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth is gaping open, unable to keep her own jaw shut. Agatha takes the opportunity, sliding her fingers up from her neck and curling them into Rio’s mouth. She can feel the slight resistance as she presses down on her tongue and a trail of saliva runs down the palm of her hand.</p><p>“You like that pretty girl? You like my fingers in your mouth and my cock in your pussy?” She returns to slowly grinding into her woman until she responds through her full mouth. “Yes.” That spurs her on, causing her to beggin quickly thrusting into her. The room fills with moans and heavy breath as Agatha brings the woman to another climax. “Agatha I-” Before the words can even leave her mouth, she falls limp onto the bed, moaning loudly as Agatha slows her thrusts, allowing her to ride it out. After about a minute, Agatha slowly pulls out. She begins to shift to take the harness off but Rio reaches out, her hand landing lazily on the side of the harness. “No. Keep it on.” She requests and Agatha can’t help but comply.</p><p>She slides herself next to Rio, pulling her closer. Rio gasps when the dildo presses against the curve of her ass.</p><p>“Worth the wait.” Rio says breathlessly.</p><p>“Definitely.” Agatha hums, ending the statement with a chaste kiss to her neck.</p>

<strong>May</strong>
</p><p>“Oh am I interrupting?” Agatha laughs when she walks into Rio’s apartment where she sees the woman wearing her bullsnakes jersey, standing no more than a foot away from the TV.</p><p>“Shhhh.” She waves a hand around in Agatha's direction. Agatha looks at the TV where the Bullsnakes have a free throw. “YES!” Rio screams when she makes the shot. “Tied! Three minutes in the fourth.” She explains as if that means anything to Agatha.</p><p>“So we’re gonna win?” Agatha asks, plopping down onto the couch.</p><p>“As long as we don’t foul anyone, yeah I think so.” Rio joins her. “How was your day?” Rio hums.</p><p>“Good. Boring. Just had to check in on some properties. You’re all I could think about.” She leans over to kiss her girlfriend when Rio suddenly jumps back up, cheering loudly.</p><p>“Campbell!” She yelps as a replay of the shot plays.</p><p>“Rio.” Agatha calls, failing to gain her attention.</p><p>“Sorry babe, this is the finals. Tied game seven and we’re about to win it!” She cheers, paying no mind to her grumbling girlfriend. Agatha allows Rio to savor the rest of the game. She ends up also watching closely as the game comes to an end. With a few seconds left and the score at 121- 119, the bullsnakes have possession and are going for a three.</p><p>“C’mon c’mon c’mon!” Rio chants as the final buzzer sounds, just as the ball leaves the bullsnakes hands.</p><p>“Wahooooo!” Rio loudly cheers when they sink the perfect half court shot and win the championship. “YEAAAHHH!” She continues to scream as they replay the shot before panning over the lively arena. “Shalifoeeee!” Rio screams, whipping around so Agatha can see her elated face.</p><p>“Did you see that!” She yells and Agatha laughs while nodding. “Buzzer beater shot in the finals game! We’ve never won!”</p><p>Agatha simply watches Rio. The pure joy on her face isn’t something that is often seen. Rio is typically cocky, calculated, weird but not joyful. But this, this happy and unreserved side of Rio? This is just for her. Every smile, every soft moment, only she sees it. Only she knows Rio and only Rio knows her. So when she uncharacteristically stands up to celebrate with her, Rio gets that same warm feeling in her heart.</p><p>
<strong>July </strong>
</p><p>“Agatha!” Rio yelps, bursting into the home. “You’ll never guess what happened today!” She suddenly appears in the living room, breathing heavily like she ran all the way from the car. She did.</p><p>Agatha immediately forgets to ask her to go on as she takes in her full form. Her hair is pulled back into a bun, she's wearing all khaki and somehow making it ridiculously attractive. She has a few streaks of dirt across her skin and the summer sun has brought on a nice tan. Agatha could jump her right now.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>“Hm?” She shakes her head. “Yeah yeah what did you do?” She pulls her attention back.</p><p>“So!” She slams onto the couch. “I’m going around with the arborist just doing our check and we see this thing out in the distance by the marsh.” She starts. “We thought it might be a beaver or something so we just got a little closer so we could see.” Agatha slowly nods to say she’s listening. But Rio’s partially unbuttoned polo is definitely taking some of her attention.</p><p>“And it was a baby moose trying to get across to its mama!” She coos. Agatha has discovered that Rio has quite the soft spot for animals. No matter what animal it is, she is almost always wildly educated on it or completely enthralled about what she doesn't know.</p><p>“So we guided it to a more shallow part of the marsh until it could cross. Luckily the mom didn’t charge us.” She lets out a relieved laugh. “The other side was a pretty steep drop off. She couldn’t see over the bushes.”</p><p>“Well I was actually hoping that was going to lead to you getting chased by an angry mama moose.” Agatha chuckles.</p><p>“Oh you would’ve loved that.”</p><p>Agatha nods. “It would’ve made for a much better story.”</p><p>“Well next time there's a mountain lion, I’ll be sure to approach it so you can have a funny story of how your girlfriend got mauled to death.”</p><p>Agatha laughs. “That would be much better. Thank you.” She leans in to kiss Rio who barely lets out a scoff before her mouth is taken over by Agathas.</p><p>
<strong>September</strong>
</p><p>“Hi baby.” Agatha greets when she finds Rio in the kitchen.</p><p>“Hi.” Rio replies sweetly, offering up her cheek for the woman to kiss. Agatha does just that but as she continues walking, she’s inexplicably drawn back in, moving to stand directly behind her, wrapping her arms around her waist.</p><p>Agatha hums against her neck, inhaling deeply. “You smell good.” She mumbles, placing a delicate kiss to where her nose previously was.</p><p>Rio lightly chuckles at the compliment. “Like dirt and smoke from the fires up in westview?”</p><p>“Mhm.” Agatha hums, barely coming up for air. Rio lightly chuckles as Agatha continues to breathe her in, wrapping her arms even tighter around the woman until her fingertips are resting just above her navel. She slowly continues to slide her fingers down, dipping them under her waistband.<br/>
Rio stands herself straight up, reaching down, grabbing the woman’s wrist before she can go any further. She lifts her hand and spins around, holding her hand up between them.</p><p>“Nuh uh.” She tsks. “I’m cooking. You have to wait.” She throws her hand back to her. Agatha groans, leaning back into the woman, placing more heavy kisses to her neck, feeling the low rumble of a moan against her throat.</p><p>Rio presses a hand to her chest, pushing her back once more.</p><p>“I said wait.” She says sternly, staring her girlfriend down.</p><p>Agatha stares back at her, challenging the woman but she falters under Rio's gaze, letting out a disappointed groan as she takes a step back. Rio continues on with her cooking, not thinking much about Agatha simply watching her.</p><p>She looks Rio up and down, clearly deep in thought when she suddenly suggests. “Why don’t you just move in?”<br/>
Rio snaps her neck to look at Agatha. “What?”</p><p>Agatha shrugs. “You’re here all the time, I don’t see the point of you paying for your place and having to go out of your way to water your plants when you could just live here.” She shrugs casually.</p><p>Rio scoffs out a laugh. “You’re very funny.”</p><p>“Fine, don’t take the offer.”</p><p>Rio stares back at Agatha, trying her hardest to read her expression. If she is indeed just kidding, she doesn't want to embarrass herself by jumping at the opportunity. But Agatha's eyes tell her she means it.</p><p>“You mean it?”</p><p>“I do.” Agatha takes her by the waist again, pulling her into a gentle kiss, toying with her bottom lip. “I need you here all the time.” She whispers against her lips.</p><p>“You just want me to keep cooking for you.” Rio replies.</p><p>“There's that.” Agatha moves her hands to cup Rio's face, gently caressing her cheekbones with her thumb. “Then there's the idea that I get to see those gorgeous eyes every morning and every night.” She changes to her usual sultry tone. “Plus,” She slides a hand down to squeeze her ass. “easier access if you live here.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t pack soon enough.</p><p>
<strong>October </strong>
</p><p>“One more month.” Rio says from the dining room, through the comfortable silence of their home.</p><p>Agatha doesn't even look up from her phone, yelling back, “Until?”</p><p>“Ski season!”</p><p>“Oh yeah.” She shrugs. All that really means to her is that it's time to go back to work. But then again, things will be different this season. Rio will be there and not just as her annoying coworker but as her, still annoying, but adoring partner.</p><p>Agatha wills herself to stand and join Rio in the dining room when her shoulder brushes a large plant on her way over.</p><p>“These stupid fucking plants.” Agatha swats at the giant leaf of what she thinks Rio called a Fiddling leaf… something.</p><p>“Don’t hit it you asshole!” Rio yells at her.</p><p>“How is it that your place seemed to fit the same amount of plants better than my entire house?”</p><p>“Well there’s <em>not</em> the same amount of plants.” Rio says, pointing around the main level. “That ones new, that one's new, and that one and that one.”</p><p>Agatha groans. “Okay, you’re cut off.”</p><p>Rio throws her head back, letting out an almost villainous laugh. “Okay.” She says, condescending as she pats Agatha's cheek. “Scratchy loves them.” She points to the bunny that is sleeping right next to a plant, a soft beam of sunlight perfectly cascading over him while one leaf protects his eyes.</p><p>“He’s not on your side.” Agatha states, crossing her arms.</p><p>“Yeah he is.” Rio retorts. “I think I'm gonna start a garden this spring. He deserves some fresh carrots.”</p><p>“Perfect! The plants will be outside where they belong.” Agatha cheers.</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes and walks off to water the indoor forest.</p><p>
<strong>December</strong>
</p><p>The snow from this season has been perfect all month. Especially today, there’s twelve inches of powder from the night before and it is still snowing at one o’clock.</p><p>The main road up to the mountains was closed the night before so Agatha's lesson for the day is just two five and eight year old sisters that are here on a family trip. Rio has a similar situation, except, instead of using their lunch break to warm up in the lodge, she has her kid outside helping her build a snowman.</p><p>“Use the poles for the arms.” She instructs the little girl who without question goes and stabs them into their creation.</p><p>“Perfect!” Rio steps back, admiring their masterpiece. “C’mon let's go get her.” She waves for her kid to follow her inside where they find Agatha and her kids almost ready to hit the slopes again. Rio picks up her helmet.</p><p>“Come outside. We wanna show you something.” She says with a wicked grin on her face.</p><p>“I’m busy.” Agatha doesn't even look up at her as she zips up the younger sister's jacket. Rio waits, swinging Agatha's helmet around until she notices.</p><p>“Rio, give it back.” She holds her hand out but Rio quickly turns and walks away, knowing Agatha will have to follow.</p><p>She beats her outside and uses the head start to set the helmet on top of their snowman. Agatha walks outside and around to where she left her skis but her eyes are caught by what Rio did. The snowman they made has Agatha’s skis stabbed into the ground under it, her poles are the arms, and her helmet is crammed on top of it, now full of snow.</p><p>“What do you think?” Rio asks, biting her tongue between her teeth. Agatha is still staring at the snowman when Rio steps in front of her, grinning.</p><p>“I think… it’d look a lot better if-” She wastes no time as she suddenly shoves Rio back. She yelps as she crashes into the snowman. But she only takes out the two top parts of it, which sends her flying back over the base, landing with her feet straight up in the air, successfully destroying the snowman.</p><p>“Much better.” Agatha dusts off her hands, accompanied by the hysterical laughter of the little girls. Rio grunts, gathering a clump of snow, not even bothering to ball it up before chucking it at Agatha's head.</p><p>Agatha dodges it. “Get my skis while you’re down there.” She points. Rio of course ends up bringing her all her gear, although she lazily throws it into a pile at her feet.</p><p>“Thanks.” Agatha smiles. “See you at home.” And with that, she heads off with her kids frantically following after her.</p><p>That night, they’re relaxing on the couch, their go to spot when they’re home. Neither of them are particularly invested in the movie they selected but they’re also too lazy to change it. It’s still snowing, the large windows and the light of the moon creating a peaceful atmosphere around them. Rio looks out at the snow and thinks.</p><p>“So…” She walks her fingers up Agatha's chest. “What do I have to do to get you on a snowboard this season?”</p><p>“No.” Agatha shakes her head.</p><p>“C’mon! I skied for you!”</p><p>“Because you lost a bet. I’m not just gonna snowboard because I'm fucking you.”</p><p>“C’mon, baby.” Rio whines, leaning up to ghost her lips next to her ear. “I’ll do <em>anything</em>.” She whispers with a nip to her ear lobe.</p><p>Agatha hums, dramatically tapping her chin as she thinks of a condition. “Maybe…” She grabs her chin, pulling her so they’re face to face. “You show me what you can do with that pretty mouth of yours.” She tilts her head back. “Then we’ll see if you’ve earned it.”</p><p>Rio sends her back a wicked grin and quickly obliges, sealing it with a heavy kiss while she shoves her back onto the couch. She wastes no time as she slides her hand down Agatha's abdomeonen, working her hand into the waistband of her pants.</p><p>She stares into Agatha’s eyes, her pupils are blown, there's nothing left of her iris except for a thin blue ring. Her eyes are running over her face, they’re fiery and wanting as she’s waiting for Rio to do something.</p><p>So without another word, Rio immediately makes her way down, softly running her lips over her collarbone. She runs her tongue down her body, between her breasts and down to her abdomen. Agatha's stomach tenses when she reaches there. A little further and she's right in front of her slit. Her breath is hot against Agatha's skin and her cascading long hair tickles her thighs. She shivers, “Rio.” The woman looks up through heavy lashes. Agatha freezes for a moment as deep brown eyes stare up at her. It takes everything in her not to pull her back up to her level and make her moan. She fights the urge and instead takes a hair tie off of her wrist, bunching Rio’s hair and tying it up. She places her hand on the top of Rio’s head and shoves it back down to her cunt.</p><p>Rio wastes no more time and runs her tongue up her slit. Agatha twitches. Every swipe of her tongue sends an ethereal rush through Agatha's body. Her thighs clench around her head when she takes her clit between her lips.<br/>
Rio slows down and looks up at Agatha. Her eyes are shut and her jaw is slack, her head tilted up at the ceiling. She leans back a little to speak.<br/>
“Look at me.” She commands her. Agatha freezes for a moment before opening her eyes and tilting her head down to look at the woman between her legs.</p><p>“You’re so pretty like this.” Rio tells her, voice low and laced with lust. Agatha groans and grasps at Rio's hair, pulling her face back down.</p><p>“Just shut up.” She says breathlessly. Rios first thought is to mess with her, to make her beg for her own pleasure. But seeing Agatha splayed out above her, back arched, her attempting to clench onto the couch cushions, she only wants to make her feel good so she does exactly that.</p><p>She sucks on her clit harshly and slides two fingers into her, making the older woman let out a pathetic groan. Agatha trembles when Rio's fingers curl into her. She teases her clit with her tongue, now directing most of her attention to her fingers. Until Agatha's hand returns to the back of her head, begging her to continue her exploration. Rio obliges, leaving her fingers curling inside her, combining the movement with sucking on her clit. She can feel the flame inside her, igniting further with every hot breath Rio breathes or movement she makes. One more flick of her tongue and that's the last thing she needs to send her over the edge. Her thighs clench around Rio's head as she spasms, crying out in ecstasy. Rio laps up every last drop before she crawls her way up to Agatha as she falls limp onto her. Rio cranes her neck up to kiss her. Agatha can taste herself on the other woman's lips.</p><p>“I love you.” Rio sighs, now lying down fully on top of Agatha, her face tucked into her neck. Agatha takes a few more seconds to catch her breath before responding.</p><p>“I love you too.” She whispers above her ear.</p><p>Rio only allows a few seconds to pass before ruining the moment by saying, “You can borrow one of my old boards.”</p><p>
<strong> January</strong>
</p><p>“Let's go!” Rio yells at Agatha in the locker room.</p><p>“Gimme a second. You’re so fucking impatient.” She grumbles as she finishes pulling on her gloves.</p><p>“Ugh.” Rio forcefully groans, taking Agatha by the waist, pulling her closer. “You are so fucking hot right now.”</p><p>“The only difference is my boots.” Agatha points out with a scoff.</p><p>Rio hums. “I think it’s the overall vibe.” She grins when Agatha rolls her eyes and pushes her away.</p><p>Agatha picks up the extra board Rio let her borrow. “Let's do it.”</p><p>Rio stands there in awe, taking all of her woman in. “Now this is doing it for me.”</p><p>“One more comment from you and I'm pushing you off the lift again.” Agatha points before walking out of the building. Rio laughs and takes off after her.</p><p>At the top, they unload from the gondola like usual and walk over to the learner lift. Without any prompting, Agatha plops herself down at the top of the run and straps into her board. Rio doesn't think much of it. Agatha has watched hundreds of snowboarders strap in. It’s not exactly rocket science.</p><p>“Okay so before you get up, watch what I do.” Rio tells her, rolling over so she’s on her knees. She pushes herself up, leans on her toes, and keeps her knees bent so she stays in place for the most part.</p><p>“Okay.” Agatha also flips over, albeit a little less graceful than Rio. Rio watches as she psychs herself up before pushing off the hill. She manages to get herself upright, sliding a little further back than she wanted.</p><p>“Nice baby!” Rio cheers for her. “Alright.” She claps. “Let's get you on that heel.” She begins to gear up to instruct Agatha again but the second she looks back at the woman, she's suddenly taking off down the run.</p><p>“Agath-!” Rio yells to her but stops when she processes her going down the run like it’s nothing. Her turns aren’t perfect but she clearly doesn’t need any instruction. Rio’s jaw is dropped as she just stands there, watching in awe until she see’s Agatha come to a stop at the bottom, leaning back so she’s sitting down. Rio has to psychically shake her own head in order to tell herself to get going.</p><p>She comes to a stop just under Agatha, dropping to her knees and hopping the rest of the way up so her knees meet the bottom of Agatha's board.</p><p>“I hate you.” Is all she says, unable to mask the pure awe she’s experiencing.</p><p>Agatha shrugs, wickedly grinning back at her girlfriend. “I said I wouldn’t snowboard. I never said I couldn’t.”</p><p>Rio just playfully shakes her head, helpless to the smile forcing its way onto her face. She then places her hands on Agatha's knees and leans in without a second thought until purple catches her eyes and she remembers the thin fabric barrier between them.</p><p>“Ugh, get this stupid thing out of my way.” Rio says, pawing at Agatha's face cover with her glove, successfully pulling it down, immediately diving back in for a kiss. Agatha hums into the kiss, laughing when their goggles scrape together.</p><p>
<strong>2 years later </strong>
</p><p>“This is the best.” Rio says, placing her hands on her hips as she looks out at the gorgeous mountain range before them. They’re at the very back of the mountain. There are no more than three other people up there with them as the season is coming to an end. She expects Agatha to say something, to agree with her or oppose her statement simply to piss her off. But all she hears is the rustle of her jacket behind her.</p><p>“Don’t you think so?” She asks, still facing forward. When she still doesn't get a response, she turns around. “Agatha?”</p><p>And there she is, her goggles pulled up, both of her gloves off, her poles stabbed into the ground next to her, and she’s holding something. She has a hint of a smile on her face, her eyes filling with adoration when Rio pulls her goggles off to better see what's happening. Rio’s eyes return to Agatha's hands where she sees a loose ring pinched between her fingers.</p><p>Rio’s jaw drops. “No fucking way.”</p><p>“Well I can’t really kneel like this.” She taps one ski on the ground, chuckling as Rio’s eyes grow even wider. She raises the ring so it’s sitting between them.</p><p>“Rio Vidal, You are so infuriating, and annoying, and… hot.” She breathes out before swapping to a tone more convincing, more genuine. “I like having you around. I like how we feel together.” Rio is simply gazing back at her, trying her best to keep from interrupting. “You wanna maybe marry me?” Agatha shrugs, raising her eyebrows.</p><p>Rio only responds by frantically nodding her head and ripping her helmet off. She grabs Agatha's face, smashing their lips together, all while she’s trying to not fall over since still only one foot is strapped in.</p><p>“So yes?” Agatha asks.</p><p>“Yes yes yes.” Rio quickly repeats, crashing their lips together again.</p>

</p><p>Agatha sits back in her chair, lazily stretching her arms behind her. She’s been in her home office for half of the day, taking care of her annual checks for her properties. She's been undisturbed and thankful for it, but right now she realises that the house is suspiciously quiet. There's usually some sort of sound in the home, whether that's music, or laughter, or Rio yelling at a Bullsnakes game, it’s always something. But today, it's silent.</p><p>She wills herself up and walks downstairs to find Rio, in the living room, with her back to her, leaning over, doing… something?</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha screams, attempting to scare her but it of course failed.</p><p>“Agatha!” She calls back, standing straight up. She takes a few seconds before she turns around, proudly holding their three year old son straight out in front of her.</p><p>“Mama! Look!” Nicky sticks his legs straight out to make sure that Agatha can see the snowboard strapped to his feet.</p><p>Agatha stands there, jaw tight, her eyes glued to the snowboard with a green monster on the bottom. She then looks back up, staring daggers into Rio. “What the fuck is that?”</p><p>“Nickys first snowboard!” Rio beams, somehow holding the boy out further. Agatha simply crosses her arms, tilting her head disapprovingly.</p><p>“C’mon babe. Look how cute he is!” She steps closer, and Nicky smiles wider. She swears they conspire to use their adorable matching faces against her.</p><p>Agatha forces herself to resist cooing at her adorable baby boy and turns her annoyance back towards her wife. “We agreed we would let him pick which one he does.”</p><p>“He did!” She turns Nicky back around so they’re face to face. “Nick, do you want to ski like Mama or snowboard with Mami?”</p><p>“Snowboard!” He simply answers, slightly mispronouncing the word.</p><p>Rio shrugs. “The man has chosen.” She sets Nicky back down and gets to undoing his bindings so he doesn't fall over.<br/>
“And if i’m not mistaken, you know how to snowboard so you can join us at any time.” Rio shrugs.</p><p>Agatha loudly huffs instead of responding but that’s enough for Rio to know she won. Once Nicky is free from his boots, he runs off to play with his toys. Rio sets the board and boots to the side then moves to stand in front of Agatha, draping her arms over her shoulders, bending her knees so she’s forced to look up at her.</p><p>“I was thinking we could go up tomorrow. Just see how he likes it.” She hums, moving to place a gentle kiss to her wife’s jaw. She can feel her melt into the embrace. “Sound good?”</p><p>Agatha sighs as Rio continues to kiss along her jaw and down to her neck. She knows it’s her weakness and makes good use of it.</p><p>“No it doesn’t sound good.” Agatha grumbles. “But whatever.” She can feel Rio smile against her neck. She smiles herself, then snaps it back to an annoyed scowl the second Rio pulls away.</p><p>“You’re always so good for me.” Rio coos, drawing a finger along Agatha's jaw before walking off to find Nicky.</p><p>The next day, the three of them are in the gondola with Nicky ecstatically looking around like he’s in disney world.</p><p>“Mama look!” He yells and points out the window to a snowboarder flying down the mountain below them.</p><p>“That's what I look like.” Rio tells him, watching as his eyes light up with pure wonder.</p><p>“I’m gonna do that!” He beams.</p><p>Rio and Agatha both softly laugh towards each other. “Not today baby.” Agatha tells him. “But one day, yeah. You’ll be way faster than Mami.” She sends her wife a cocky grin.</p><p>“Yeah and by the end of the day you’ll be faster than Mama.” Rio tries to insult her back but Nicky is dead set on the idea of being faster than Rio.</p><p>“I’ll go so fast Mami, you won't be able to catch me!” He cheers.</p><p>“You wanna bet little man?” Rio teases him back, getting up in his face as if he’s actually competition.</p><p>“Hey Nicky guess what?” Agatha takes his attention back. “Mama can snowboard too. Better than Mami.” She jabs a thumb towards Rio.</p><p>“But you ski?” He adorably tilts his head.</p><p>“I can do BOTH.” She enunciates the last word, making Nicky light up once again.</p><p>“So we can all snowboard together!?”</p><p>”Yup and you and I can beat Mami to the bottom.” Her and Nicky share a knowing smile.</p><p>“Yeah okay.” Rio scoffs. She knows how good she is.</p><p>When they get to the mid station, Rio carries their gear while Agatha makes sure that Nicky doesn't fall on his way out. One of the lifties, Eddie, notices the family.</p><p>“Oh my god is this your kid!?” He asks the pair.</p><p>While they were dating, they managed to keep it to themselves then after they got married, it quickly got around to the rest of the resort. Everyone made a big deal about it and still do. Agatha hates it.</p><p>Rio jumps in. “Yup. Say Hi Nicky.”</p><p>“Hi!” He waves. “My mommies are teaching me to snowboard!”</p><p>Eddie throws on a pretend but friendly gasp. “Really!?”</p><p>Nicky nods. “Mhm!”</p><p>“Alright, let's hit it.” Agatha cuts them off while she walks away, waving for her family to come with her.</p><p>On their walk over to the bunny hill, Nicky is looking around, happily running ahead of his parents.</p><p>“Look, he already loves it.” Rio smiles.</p><p>“He better. It’s in his blood. This is the whole reason he exists.”</p><p>Rio lightly chuckles and Agatha softly smiles back at her. As annoyed as she's pretending to be about the whole thing, she can’t help but notice the full feeling in her heart. She never expected to fall in love with the annoying snowboarder she worked with. She especially never expected to find herself as the mother to a carbon copy of that snowboarder.</p><p>They walk up to the top of the “run” where Rio pats for Nicky to sit down.</p><p>“Remember how I showed you how to strap in?” Rio asks, setting his board in front of him. He nods and gets to work. He successfully secures the top two straps, then partially manages to do the toe ones so Rio quickly adjusts them for him.</p><p>“Perfect.” She smiles. “Okay, so first we’re just gonna get you standing.” She holds her hands out for Nicky to take as she pulls him up. She doesn't have her board on and is just focused on getting him to balance. “Now remember what I told you yesterday? Try your heel.” She tells him and he follows the instruction.</p><p>“Good! Now toe!”</p><p>He tips forward, with most of the work being done by Rio but he still has the move down. “Nice! We’re gonna move now, I’ll walk with you.” Rio says as the start to go down. Rio holds his hands but as they get further, his grip gets looser. “Good job buddy!” She cheers when they get to the bottom. Nicky is wearing the widest grin ever on his face, like he just got into the olympics.</p><p>“Lets go again!” He tries to hop away but just ends up falling face first into the snow. Agatha and Rio both let out loud laughs while Nicky tries to pick himself up, also laughing.</p><p>“We get to ride the magic carpet.” Rio helps him up and slides him over to the lift. Once they get on, Nicky is standing on his own and Agatha takes the opportunity to take a cute picture of him and Rio riding up together.</p><p>“Can I do it by myself?” He asks, lazily swinging his arms.</p><p>“Yeah, let's try.”</p><p>They get to the top and start up again.</p><p>“Okay, go to Mama.” Rio lets him go. Nicky keeps his arms out and his knees bent while the board carries him down the run. Agatha notices he’s doing well so she begins to walk backwards to see how far he can make it.</p><p>“I can do it!” He cheers. Then without realizing that he has too much weight on one foot, he begins to slowly turn. He then catches an edge and face plants again. Agatha goes to check on him while also laughing, especially when she sees his scrunched face.</p><p>“That was so good!” She encourages him.</p><p>“Nick!” Rio runs down to them. “Good job!” He accepts her high-five with a huff. “Remember, if you’re not falling, you’re not trying!” She picks him back up without warning so they can start again.</p><p>Rio waits until they’re back on the magic carpet before correcting him. “Okay bud, what happened is you were leeeeaning back on this foot.” She demonstrates what he did wrong. “You need to keep your body in the middle of the board. You’re not ready to turn yet. We’ll do that next.”</p><p>He quickly practices holding his weight in the right spot, laser focused. Rio softly smiles, it’s cute how serious he’s taking this.</p><p>On the next attempt, Nicky stays up all the way to the bottom where Agatha catches him.</p><p>“That was great!” Agatha cheers, lifting a giggling Nicky into the air.</p><p>“Good job baby!” Rio yells from the top.</p><p>“I wanna do it again!” He yells and Agatha sets him on the magic carpet to send him up to his Mami.</p><p>At the top, Rio slides him over to her. “You wanna see Mami do it?” She asks him as she sits down to strap into her own board. He once again nods his head and plops himself down to watch.</p><p>“Look at my feet okay?” and with that, she takes off, careful to over exaggerate her movements for her son to see. When she gets to the bottom, she stops on her knees. “Heel toe! Try it!” She yells back up to him. Nicky pushes himself to stand up and begins to slide down. “Heel!” She calls and he mimics the movement. “Toe!” He starts to lean forward but he catches an edge again and hits the ground, hard. He’s on his stomach with his feet on the upside of the hill.</p><p>Agatha gets to him first and Rio follows quickly after. Agatha helps him get situated so he’s not upside down on the run. The couple has to stop themselves from laughing when they see his annoyed scowl on his face. He might look like Rio, but he is all Agatha.</p><p>“Hey, no, you’re okay.” Rio starts but the boy is still grumbling. “What do we say?”</p><p>He stubbornly crosses his arms and lets out a forceful huff.</p><p>“Nicky?”</p><p>He grumbles at first then finally says it, in a very whiny voice. “If you’re not falling, you’re not trying.”</p><p>“That's right!” Rio whoops and stands back up. “Now finish the run!” She pulls him to his feet and walks alongside him until they make it to the bottom.</p><p>By lunch time, Nicky has already picked up on turning and can go down the bunny hill completely unassisted. When they get to the lodge, he pulls off his helmet and crawls under the table to lie down. He’s completely exhausted and very hungry but the content smile on his face says he couldn’t be happier.</p><p>“See, he’s great at it!” Rio points out as if Agatha didn’t notice that herself.</p><p>“I know. I birthed him, of course he’s good.” She moves the praise to herself. She is ridiculously proud of Nicky but she also refuses to let Rio be right. But Rio knows, she saw the lit up smile on her wife’s face the entire time they were teaching him.</p><p>After lunch, Agatha takes Nicky outside to get ready while Rio tells them to go ahead so she can trudge down to the bathrooms that are inexplicably downstairs.</p><p>“Nicky.” Agatha calls her son's attention, he’s already busied himself with making a pile of snow. “You wanna prank Mami?”</p><p>He immediately nods his head. Agatha finds the biggest pro to having a kid, is using him to carry out her devious plans to annoy Rio.</p><p>She smiles, taking Rio's board and walking them over to the side of the hill. “Okay, when Mami comes out, while she’s putting on her gloves, you call her and then when she looks at you, push her board down this.” She points to the untouched powder off to the side. Even if the board doesn't go far, Rio will have some digging to do.</p><p>Nicky covers his mouth to quietly laugh as if Rio can hear them. Eight minutes later, when Rio approaches them, she is, as expected, distracted by pulling on her gloves.</p><p>“Mami!” Nicky yells and the second she looks up, he completes his mission by shoving her board down the hill.</p><p>“Nicky!” Rio yelps, frantically chasing after the board. Only three steps in, she is immediately up to her knees in powder. After about ten feet, the board stops and Rio begins digging to get it out. When she stomps her way over to the run adjacent to her. Agatha comes skiing up, holding Nicky as the two of them are dying laughing.</p><p>“Point and laugh, Nicky. Point and laugh.” Agatha says and they do just that. Rio tries her best to suppress her grin but the sound of Agatha's bellowing laugh and Nicky's adorable giggle, washes all her annoyance away. She silently admits that it was actually pretty funny.</p><p>“Did Mama put you up to this?” Rio asks the boy who just lets out a squeal of laughter as a response.</p><p>“As a part of this family, he has to learn how we roll up here.” Agatha shrugs.</p><p>“So it’s fair game then?” Rio stands up once her board is on her feet.</p><p>“If you can catch us!” Agatha yells, taking off with Nicky in her arms. Rio smiles as Nicky continues to die of laughter. She quickly takes off after them, using her lack of a child in her arms as an advantage when they get to a road.</p><p>“I’ll take that.” Rio grabs onto Nicky, yanking him out of Agatha's arms, sending her crashing to the ground.</p><p>“That's how we do things in this family!” She yells back while Nicky's laughter fades off as they get further away. Agatha quickly gets herself up but her lack of poles makes picking up speed a little more difficult than usual. But alas, Rio is still on a snowboard and she’s soon able to catch up.</p><p>“Look Mama!” Nicky yells as Rio now has him by the armpits, holding him so he can ride the snow with her.</p><p>Agatha simply smiles at the boy and then turns her attention back to Rio.</p><p>“Let him go. I’ll stay behind him.” She says and Rio lets go without question.</p><p>“Do what I do.” Rio tells him as she slides in front of him. Agatha smiles softly as she watches him physically focus, quickly adjusting to follow Rios exact movements.</p><p>He mimics her well, Agatha is sure to give him enough space to move and Rio tries to not watch him the entire time. He really is a natural, while he’s still a little wobbly, you would never know it’s his first day. The road dips into a slightly steeper run that he manages to get down as Rio shifts to large turns so he’s not going too fast.</p><p>“Okay bud, it gets really steep here.” Agatha scoops him back up when she sees Rio quickly take off over the next edge. Nicky is joyfully scream-laughing the entire way down. Agatha intentionally straight lines so they can go as fast as possible. Nickys snowboard on his feet makes it a little awkward but he could care less. When they spot Rio at the bottom, Agatha skids to a stop above her, spraying her with snow, nearly flinging Nicky out of her grasp.</p><p>“Did you see me Mami!?” He yelps, proudly grinning at Rio.</p><p>“I did! You did so good!” She happily tells him, holding up another high five. “Are you ready to ride the real lift?”</p><p>He frantically nods his head.</p><p>“Okay, now I can show you how to skate.” Rio undoes one foot. “So you step behind your board and push yourself like that.” She once again demonstrates for him. Agatha unclips one foot for him and he follows after Rio. “Perfect!” She calls as they slide into line. When it’s their turn to get on the lift, Agatha is sure to help him up while Rio pulls the bar down for them.</p><p>“When are you gonna be old enough to leave the bar up? You’re making me look like a jerry up here.” Agatha teases him and he just laughs.</p><p>“Can we do a big run again?” He asks, lazily swinging his free leg. Agatha looks to Rio since she’s the one doing the teaching.</p><p>“For sure. We’ll go all the way to the bottom!” Rio points to the map built into the bar, showing Nicky the route with her finger.</p><p>“Whooo, someone is gonna be tired tonight.” Agatha pats him on the back.</p><p>“Not me!”</p><p>“Yeah you will. You’ll hit that mattress and then-“ She closes her eyes and mimics loudly snoring.</p><p>“Nuh uh!” Nicky yells but Agatha just continues, only getting louder. “Mama!” He yells, pulling at her jacket.</p><p>Rio snickers next to them, causing Nicky to turn and yell at her. “Stop it! I’m not tired!” Now both of them are laughing at him. He crosses his arms defiantly.</p><p>“Oh we’re just messing with you bud, I’m gonna be tired too.” Rio pokes at his sides, making a small smile crack onto his face, followed by him finally laughing.</p><p>“How bout we watch a movie when we get home? We can even eat dinner in front of the TV!” Agatha proposes the idea that fully brings Nicky back to his usual happy self.</p><p>“Yay!” He cheers, throwing his hands in the air.</p><p>He calmly enjoys the rest of the ride, simply leaning on the bar, swinging his foot and looking over the snow-dusted trees ahead of and below him. Agatha does the same, she points out the beads and other random items strewn about the trees.</p><p>“Can we throw something?”</p><p>“We don’t have anything to throw right now but next time, yes.” Agatha answers him, watching that smile somehow grow even wider.</p><p>Rio just watches them. Nicky asks if they can bring stickers up too when Agatha shows him the clusters of stickers some people smacked onto the beams holding up the lift. The pure wonder on Nicky's face and the gentleness in Agatha's voice sends a warm feeling into her heart. Here she is, with her two favorite people, doing her favorite thing in the world. She’s taken out of her trance when they both start loudly squawking at the birds running across the snow below them. Rio playfully rolls her eyes. Either of them could have come up with the idea.</p><p>“Remember when the kid you were teaching got chased by that bird?” Agatha asks Rio who immediately bursts into laughter.</p><p>“Oh my god of course!”</p><p>“The birds chase you!?” Nicky yelps.</p><p>“No no, not you. You’re too fast.” She assures him, rubbing his shoulder. Nicky lets out a visible sigh of relief.</p><p>They spend the rest of the day going down the front of the mountain. Nicky snowboards on the easy parts until one of his moms scoops him up and carries him until he’s safe to take off again. He takes a few spills, which he easily recovers from when Rio yells “If you’re not falling, you’re not trying!” Except for one that knocks the wind out of him and they have to stop so he can catch his breath and build his confidence back up.</p><p>On the ride home, they talk about every last detail of the day.</p><p>“So we’re hitting the terrain park next time right Nick?” Rio asks over her shoulder.</p><p>“Yeah!” Nicky cheers, gaining amused laughs from his parents.</p><p>“I’ll get him in the bath.” Agatha tells Rio when they pull up to the house. She plays it off like she’s taking the harder job but it’s mostly to get herself out of scrounging up a less than exciting dinner.</p><p>“Perfect, I’m sick of him.” Rio jokes, lightly pushing the boy who quickly responds by shoving her back with all his might.</p><p>By the time he and Agatha come back downstairs, Rio already has their plates ready and Nicky's favorite movie pulled up.</p><p>“Maleficent!” He yelps the second he recognizes it. Rio put it on for him one day when they were snowed in and he’s been obsessed ever since. He says “it’s because she's does magic” His mom’s found how much he loves it so cute. But they are also bordering on losing their minds, they’ve watched it so many times.</p><p>They eat their dinner in silence since they were all so hungry. Each of them are completely engrossed in the movie as if they didn’t watch it two days ago. When they finish eating, they all flop back onto the couch, melding together into one cozy lump. Agatha leans back on the couch, swinging her arm behind Rio while Rio nuzzles into her, followed by Nicky lying on top of Rio.</p><p>Thirty minutes later, Agatha looks down where she see’s Nicky passed out, still resting his head on Rio’s chest, who is also dead asleep. She softly smiles at the sight. Her wife and son peacefully asleep in her arms after a full day of skiing. It’s simple, it’s perfect, it’s something she never thought she’d have. She places a kiss to the top of her lovers head, that bet was the best idea ever.</p>
